             Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s public support slipped in an opinion survey today
after revising a mining tax and a policy on asylum seekers ahead
of an election planned for later this year.  
 The ruling Labor Party’s support fell three percentage
points to 52 percent in a Nielsen poll published in the Age
newspaper, compared with a survey taken immediately after
Gillard replaced  Kevin Rudd  on June 24. The opposition Liberal-
National coalition’s popularity rose three points to 48 percent.  
 “The fall in opinion is a bit of the gloss coming off
Gillard as leader and a reaction to the policies she has
announced,” said  Rick Kuhn , a political scientist at Canberra-
based Australian National University. “The government will
announce a climate change policy this week and we will have an
election in late August.”  
 Since replacing Rudd, Gillard has scaled back the
government’s proposed tax on mining companies such as  BHP 
Billiton Ltd. She has also vowed to open a regional center to
process asylum seekers to curb the rising number of refugees
from Southeast Asia arriving by boat.  
 Gillard has come under fire for suggesting East Timor
should house the center before fully negotiating the plan with
officials from the country.  
 “The refugee policy was mishandled,” Kuhn said.  
 Gillard on July 2 scaled back a plan under Rudd for a 40
percent tax on all resource profits. The government instead is
are drafting a 30 percent levy on coal and iron ore earnings.
