             White corn in South Africa, the
largest producer of the grain on the continent, fell after
prices retreated a second day in the U.S., which competes for
African export markets.  
 Corn futures for December delivery dropped 0.5 percent, to
$3.9325 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade as of 9:07 a.m.
Johannesburg time. Corn reserves in the U.S., the world’s
largest grower, will fall 7.1 percent to 1.373 billion bushels
(34.6 million metric tons) by August next year, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said July 9. That compares with the
1.292 billion bushel average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  
 White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, lost 7 rand, or 0.6
percent, to 1,170 rand ($154) a metric ton. Meal made from the
grain is the country’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for September delivery fell 4 rand, or 0.3
percent, to 1,175 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are the world’s
biggest exporters of the grain.  
 Wheat for September delivery gained 14 rand, or 0.6
percent, to 2,442 rand a ton. Morocco, Egypt and Algeria are
Africa’s largest wheat growers.  
 Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  

 
            Today’s Price   Previous Close   % Change
Sunflowers       3,400          3,388          +0.4
Soybeans         2,690          2,653          +1.4
Sorghum          1,500          1,510          -0.6
