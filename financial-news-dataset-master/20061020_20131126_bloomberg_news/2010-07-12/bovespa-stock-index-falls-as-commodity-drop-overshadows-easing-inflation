             The Bovespa stock index fell,
erasing an earlier gain, as declining metals and oil prices
dragged down commodity producers, overshadowing reports that
signaled inflation pressures may be easing in Brazil and China.  
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, dropped 1.1 percent as crude slid for the first time in
four days. Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA, Brazil’s
second-biggest steelmaker, climbed to a two-month high on
speculation the Chinese government will ease measures to cool
economic growth.  
 The Bovespa index lost 0.4 percent to 63,228.35 at 10:34
a.m. New York time, erasing a gain of as much as 0.8 percent.
The real weakened 0.4 percent to 1.7620 per dollar.
