             China’s capital markets need to open
up further as the yuan becomes more flexible, Securities Times
said, citing Zhang Yujun, president of the Shanghai Stock
Exchange.  
 Chinese markets need to shift to developing bond markets in
addition to stock markets, Zhang said in a speech recently,
according to the report.
