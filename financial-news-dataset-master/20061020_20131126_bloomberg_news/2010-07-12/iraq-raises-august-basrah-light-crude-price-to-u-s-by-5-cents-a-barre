             Iraq raised the official selling
price for its Basrah Light crude grade for August liftings to
the U.S. by 5 cents a barrel and kept the price to Asia
unchanged, the state oil marketing company said today.  
 The discount for Basrah Light crude to the U.S. narrowed to
$1.40 less than the Argus Sour Crude Index price for August,
making the grade 5 cents more expensive than in July, the
marketing agency said in an e-mailed statement. The discount to
Asia stayed at $1.10 below the Dubai-Oman benchmark price
published by Platts, the energy-information division of McGraw-
Hill Cos., Iraq said.
