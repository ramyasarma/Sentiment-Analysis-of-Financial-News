             Udonis Haslem  re-signed with the
Miami Heat to play alongside  LeBron James ,  Dwyane Wade  and  Chris Bosh .  
 The 6-foot-8 Haslem has spent all seven of his National
Basketball Association seasons with the Heat, averaging 10
points and 8.1 rebounds. He ranks second in team history in
games played and third in total rebounds.  
 “I’m excited to be back,” Haslem said in a statement.
“It’s a great opportunity to win. Miami has always been my home
and I’m happy I can play here for years to come.”  
 The Heat didn’t disclose terms of the contract in a news
release. Haslem accepted less money to stay with the Heat and
will make about $4 million annually for the next five years, the
 Miami Herald  said. He turned down offers of about $6 million a
year from the Denver Nuggets and Dallas Mavericks, the Herald
said, citing Haslem.  
 Haslem came off the bench for the Heat last season,
averaging 9.9 points and a team-leading 8.1 rebounds.
