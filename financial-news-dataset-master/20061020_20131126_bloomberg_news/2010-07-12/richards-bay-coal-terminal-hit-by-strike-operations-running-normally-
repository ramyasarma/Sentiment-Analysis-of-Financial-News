             Richards Bay Coal Terminal, Africa’s
biggest coal export facility, said members of the South African
Trade and Allied Workers’ Union started a strike today after
rejecting an offer to increase pay 9.5 percent.  
 The terminal is “running normally,” it said in an e-
mailed statement.  
 Richards Bay Coal Terminal , on South Africa’s east coast,
is owned by coal producers including  BHP Billiton Ltd. , Anglo
American Plc,  Xstrata Plc , Total SA and Sasol Ltd. It shipped
61.14 million metric tons in 2009, and its annual capacity has
since been increased to 91 million tons.  
 RBCT coal shipments fell 27 percent in June from a year
earlier after the same labor union held a strike at Transnet
Ltd., the state-owned ports and railway operator. SATAWU settled
for an 11 percent increase in May, compared with South Africa’s
inflation rate of 4.6 percent in the same month.
