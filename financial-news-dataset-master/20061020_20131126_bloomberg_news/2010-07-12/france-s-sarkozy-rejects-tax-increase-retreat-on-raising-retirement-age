             French President  Nicolas Sarkozy’s 
Cabinet endorsed his bill to overhaul the pension system after
he yesterday rejected compromise on his plan to raise the
retirement age to 62 from 60.  
 Seeking to contain the fallout from media reports
suggesting Sarkozy benefited from improper campaign gifts by
L’Oreal SA heiress  Liliane Bettencourt , Labor Minister  Eric Woerth  today bowed to leader’s demand he quit as treasurer of
the ruling Union for a Popular Movement to focus on pensions.
Woerth  told Le Figaro  he would leave the party post July 30.  
 “On pensions, not a single country in the world has
shunned the effort I am asking French people to make now,”
Sarkozy said in an interview last night on France 2 television.
“It isn’t a major reform, it’s an essential one.”  
 Sarkozy’s plan to lift the retirement age faces criticism
from France’s labor unions that deemed the reform as “unfair.”
Seven unions, including  Confederation Generale du Travail  and
Force Ouvriere, demonstrated today during the cabinet meeting,
including in front of the Labor Ministry. Sarkozy said he
expected parliamentary approval by the end of October.  
 “Let’s not get distracted from the essential, which is the
retirement reform,”  Francois Chereque , head of France’s biggest
union, the Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail,  told
Europe 1 radio today .  
 Sarkozy’s appearance last night came as his popularity
sagged to its lowest since he took office in May 2007 following
two weeks of reports in the press that Bettencourt provided cash
gifts to political figures.  
 In an hour-long live interview yesterday, Sarkozy also
dismissed any tax increase. He repeated his determination to
reduce the budget deficit to the European Union limit of 3
percent by 2013 from about 8 percent this year.  
 “If we continue this crazy race of raising taxes, there
will be no more businesses in France,” Sarkozy, 55, said.
