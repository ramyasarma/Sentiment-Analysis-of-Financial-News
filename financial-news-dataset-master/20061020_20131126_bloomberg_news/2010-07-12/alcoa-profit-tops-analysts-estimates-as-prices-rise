             Alcoa Inc. , the largest U.S.
aluminum producer, reported second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ projections as higher metal prices boosted sales. The
shares rose.  
 Earnings from continuing operations were 13 cents a share,
exceeding the 11-cent average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Net income  of $136 million, or 13 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $454 million, or 47 cents, a year
earlier, New York-based Alcoa said today in a statement. Sales
gained 22 percent to $5.19 billion.  
 Aluminum for delivery in three months increased 39 percent,
on average, in the second quarter from a year earlier on the
London Metal Exchange. The price today was still down more than
40 percent from the July 2008 high, before the global economic
recession cut demand for the metal used in everything from jet
planes to beer cans. After prices fell and  global inventories 
rose, Chief Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  idled 20 percent
of Alcoa’s aluminum-smelting capacity.  
 “The quarter came in pretty well considering what they
were facing,”  Charles Bradford , a partner at New York-based
consulting firm Affiliated Research Group LLC, said in a
telephone interview. “By any measure, 13 cents is better than a
loss a year ago, but a year ago people thought the world was
ending. You really should compare against a couple years further
back for more normal times.”  
 Alcoa Profits  
 In the 18 months through June 2008, before commodity and
stock markets tumbled,  Alcoa’s profit  excluding one-time items
averaged 62 cents a share.  
 Alcoa, the first company in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average to report earnings for the three months through June,
 rose  37 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $11.24 at 5 p.m. after the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  The
shares  dropped 33 percent this year through the close of regular
trading today, the  largest decline  in the 30-member Dow.  
 Alcoa said stronger demand from end-use markets will mean
global aluminum consumption will increase 12 percent this year,
compared with the 10 percent that the company previously
forecast.  
 During the second quarter, the union representing 6,000
workers at 11 of Alcoa’s U.S. plants agreed to avoid a strike
and accept a labor contract under which employees share a
greater portion of health-care costs.
