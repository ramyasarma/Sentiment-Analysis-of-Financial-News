             Copper dropped from a two-week high
in London after imports by China, the world’s largest metals
consumer, decreased in June, signaling that demand growth may be
weakening. Zinc slumped.  
 Three-month delivery copper fell as much as 0.8 percent to
$6,707.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded
$6,715 at 1:30 p.m. in Shanghai. The contract jumped 5.5 percent
last week, the steepest weekly rise since February. Zinc lost
2.1 percent to $1,865 a ton today.  
 Shipments of copper and products  into China fell for a
third month in June to 328,231 tons, the customs office said
July 10. That’s 17 percent less than May and 31 percent less
than a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations. Copper
in London had its first quarterly decline since 2008 in the
April-to-June period on concerns that the global economic
recovery was weakening, widening the premium of Shanghai copper
over the LME price.  
 “The unexpected decline in China’s copper imports is
bearish for prices in the short term,”  Zeng Chao , an analyst at
Everbright Futures Co., said from Shanghai today.  
 Statistics scheduled for release this week may show China’s
economic growth slowed in the second-quarter as compared with
the first three-months of the year.  
 Still, “positive signs” on China’s economic policy “may
push prices higher in the medium term,” said Zeng.  
 China’s central bank said last week it will stick to a
moderately loose monetary policy as economic growth becomes
better balanced between consumption, investment and exports.  
 Lending Loosened  
 Some Chinese banks have loosened their standards for
mortgage lending, at least on a case-by-case basis, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG in a report today. China Vanke Co. led
real estate developers’ stocks higher in Shenzhen and Shanghai
on speculation that banks are easing lending amid a slowdown in
property price gains.  
 “The tone set by China on its monetary policy and reports
on an ease in mortgage lending pulled up equities and metal
prices,” Xia Caijun, an analyst at Jinrui Futures Co., said
from Shenzhen today.  
 Copper for October delivery fell as much as 0.6 percent to
53,330 yuan ($7,875) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange and
last traded at 53,380 yuan. Aluminum for three-month delivery in
London lost 0.6 percent to $1,992 a ton, tin climbed 0.9 percent
to $17,800 a ton, lead dropped 0.8 percent to $1,830 a ton and
nickel lost 0.8 percent to $19,350 a ton.
