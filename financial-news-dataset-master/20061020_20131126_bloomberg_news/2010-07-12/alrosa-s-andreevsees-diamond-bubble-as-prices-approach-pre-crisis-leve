             ZAO Alrosa, Russia’s diamond
monopoly, sees a “bubble” emerging for rough gems as prices
approach pre-crisis levels, Chief Executive Officer Fyodor
Andreev said.  
 Russia’s government can help contain prices by selling some
of its diamond reserves onto the market, Andreev said at an
industry conference in Moscow today.
