             Millstone IV CDO Ltd., a
collateralized debt obligation created by Credit Agricole SA
that issued more than $2 billion of bonds, plans to liquidate
its assets next week.  
 The sale of notes backed by U.S. commercial mortgages,
subprime home loans and other asset-backed securities is being
managed in New York by Cowen and Co. LLC on July 19 and 20,
according a regulatory filing.  
 Most of the Millstone notes got a top rating from Moody’s
Investors Service when they were first sold by France’s largest
bank by branches in May 2007. The transaction defaulted six
months later after the value of the collateral being managed by
Church Tavern Advisors LLC declined below the outstanding senior
notes.  
 Anne-Sophie Gentil , a spokeswoman at Credit Agricole,
didn’t immediately respond to a phone call and an e-mail seeking
comment.  
 The Paris-based lender was sued for at least $100 million
over the creation and sale of the CDO, according to court papers
filed June 18 in state court in New York. Buyers of notes
accused two units of Credit Agricole of fraud and unjust
enrichment, according to a summons.  
 Loreley Financing (Jersey) No. 31 Ltd. and Loreley
Financing (Jersey) No. 32 Ltd. are seeking the return of the $50
million purchase price for the notes and damages of not less
than $50 million, according to court papers.  
 CDOs pool bonds, loans and other fixed-income assets,
channeling their income into securities of varying risk and
return.
