             Microsoft Corp.  Chief Executive
Officer  Steve Ballmer  said partners are working on Windows-based
tablet computers, reaffirming the software maker’s commitment to
the form factor popularized by Apple Inc.’s iPad.  
 “Over the course of the next several months, you will see
a range of Windows 7-based slates that I think you’ll find quite
impressive,” Ballmer said today at a Microsoft partner
 conference  in Washington, D.C.  
 Microsoft and computer-maker partners have been selling
Windows-based slate devices since 2002 without broad consumer
adoption. Last month, Apple said it sold 3 million iPads within
80 days of its release. Computer makers like Taipei-based
manufacturer Micro-Star International Co. complained Microsoft
hasn’t yet provided them with a version of Windows that will
allow them to compete with iPad.  
 Ballmer also said shipments of the Windows operating system
are growing at a rate of more than 18 percent.  
 Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington,  rose  56 cents to
$24.83 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
