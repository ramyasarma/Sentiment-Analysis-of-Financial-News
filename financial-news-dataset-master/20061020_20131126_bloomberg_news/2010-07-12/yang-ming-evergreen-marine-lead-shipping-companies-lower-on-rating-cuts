             Yang Ming Marine Transport, the
island’s second-largest container shipping line, led shipping
companies lower after several shipping companies were downgraded
by Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc.  
 Yang Ming dropped 3.2 percent to NT$18.10 as of 9:10 a.m.,
the biggest loss since June 29. The company was downgraded to
“underweight” from “overweight” by Morgan Stanley analysts
led by Sophie Loh, who said the stock’s surge over the past two
months has priced in the “near-term positives.”  
 Evergreen Marine Corp. retreated 2 percent to NT$22.25
after it was cut to “equal-weight” from “overweight” by
Morgan Stanley. U-Ming Marine Transport Corp. fell 0.6 percent
to NT$63.80 after its stock rating was reduced to “sell” from
“buy” by Citigroup.
