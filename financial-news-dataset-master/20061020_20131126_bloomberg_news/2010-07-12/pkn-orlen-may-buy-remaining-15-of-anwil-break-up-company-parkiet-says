             PKN Orlen SA  may buy the shares it
doesn’t own in Anwil SA and break up and sell the company after
failing to obtain a satisfactory price in June for its 85
percent stake,  Parkiet  said.  
 Orlen may split the chemical maker into a fertilizer and
petrochemical unit and put them on sale separately next year,
the newspaper said, citing Deputy Chief Executive Officer
 Slawomir Jedrzejczyk .  
 Orlen would have to spend as much as 200 million zloty ($62
million) to buy the 15.2 percent of Anwil owned by minority
shareholders, including the government and Energa SA, Parkiet
said.
