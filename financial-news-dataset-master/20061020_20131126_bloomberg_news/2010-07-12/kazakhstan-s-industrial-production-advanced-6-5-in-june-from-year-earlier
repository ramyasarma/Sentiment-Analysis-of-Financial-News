             Kazakhstan’s industrial production
advanced 6.5 percent in June from a year earlier, the country’s
statistics agency said.  
 Industrial output rose 11 percent in the first half from a
year earlier, helped by increases in iron ore and energy
production, the Astana-based agency said in an e-mailed
statement today.  
 The Central Asian nation increased industrial production by
1.7 percent in June from May, the agency said.
