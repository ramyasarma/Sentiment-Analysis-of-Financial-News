             Prime Minister Julia Gillard is
preparing to offer the state of Western Australia a deal in
return for backing of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s
healthcare reform plan, the Australian newspaper said.  
 Under the deal, the state would be required to hand over a
smaller portion of its GST funding than the one third required
of other states. The remainder of the GST would be placed in a
fund for healthcare spending controlled by Western Australia,
the newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.
