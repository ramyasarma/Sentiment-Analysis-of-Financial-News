             Parex Banka AS, the lender taken
over by the Latvian government in 2008, sold a second set of
bonds to depositors who face restrictions on withdrawals.  
 The lender sold bonds worth about 11.6 million euros ($14.6
million) to depositors who faced restrictions, bringing the
total size of the bond sales to 29.3 million euros, the bank
said in a  statement  to the Riga stock exchange today.  
 Restrictions on withdrawals were put on large deposits at
Parex after it was seized by the state following a run on its
deposits. Selling the two-year Eurobonds with a coupon of 5
percent and the agreements with the depositors for a longer
maturity may allow the regulator to lift restrictions as the
money will remain at the bank.  
 The Financial and Capital Markets Commission and the
government imposed transaction limits on Parex’s clients of
35,000 lati ($62,090) a month after the bailout to stem the
outflow of funds.  
 The Latvian state-asset sales department owns 76.6 percent
of Parex and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development holds a 19.7 percent stake. The remainder is held by
minority shareholders.
