             Asian  stocks  fluctuated as gains by
resource companies overshadowed declines in Japan after the
ruling Democratic Party of Japan lost control of the upper house
in elections yesterday.  
 Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest mining company,
advanced 0.6 percent in Sydney and  Newcrest Mining Ltd. ,
Australia’s No. 1 gold producer, climbed 0.8 percent after metal
prices climbed.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s
biggest bank by market value, fell 0.7 percent and Canon Inc.,
the world’s biggest camera maker, decreased 1 percent in Tokyo.  
 “Signs of recovery in the commodities market show that
investors’ concerns about a global double dip are easing,” said
 Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co.
in Tokyo. “The unexpectedly small number of seats won by the DPJ
may prompt investors to take a wait-and-see approach.”  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  fell 0.1 percent to 116.05 as
of 9:27 a.m. in Tokyo, with about as many shares advancing as
declining.  
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s loss of control of
parliament’s upper house undermines his administration’s ability
to pass legislation to cut the world’s largest public debt and
creates the possibility of a third leadership change in a year.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.1 percent.
The gauge rose 0.7 percent in New York on July 9 amid optimism
about earnings reports and a rally in metals prices.  
 The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals jumped 1.6
percent on July 9. Copper futures for September delivery climbed
1.3 percent in New York, on increasing speculation that global
growth will be resilient and metals demand will gain. Gold
futures for August delivery advanced 1.1 percent on July 9, the
most since June 17. Crude-oil futures rose 0.9 percent.
