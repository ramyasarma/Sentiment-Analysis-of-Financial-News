             Unity Bank Plc, one of 10 Nigerian
lenders bailed out by the central bank last year, said it
returned to profit in the first half as revenue climbed.  
 Net income totaled 7 billion naira ($46.4 million) in the
six months through June, compared with a loss of 10.1 billion
naira in the same period a year earlier, the Lagos-based lender
said in a statement published in the Guardian newspaper today.
Revenue increased 29 percent to 26.6 billion naira, it said.
