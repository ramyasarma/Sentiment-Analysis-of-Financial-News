earnings growth will benefit as the economic expansion quickens.

predicted by economists.

and corporate earnings numbers will surprise on the upside,”
said  Deven Choksey , chief executive officer at K.R. Choksey

percent in the June quarter.

 Infosys, the second-biggest software exporter, gained 0.8
percent to 2,895.9 rupees, while larger rival  Tata Consultancy
Services Ltd.  added 2.2 percent to 791.7 rupees. Choksey expects
Infosys to raise its earnings outlook tomorrow. The company will
be the first of India’s largest to report earnings for the three
months through June.

telecommunications company by market value, added 5.1 percent to
70.1 rupees, the highest close in nine months. The stock was
