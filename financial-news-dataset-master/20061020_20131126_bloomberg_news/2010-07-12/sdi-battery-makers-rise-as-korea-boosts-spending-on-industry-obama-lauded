             Samsung SDI Co.  and  LG Chem Ltd.  led
South Korean lithium-ion rechargeable battery makers higher
after the government pledged investments in an industry U.S.
President  Barack Obama  singled out last year.  
 Samsung SDI  added  4.1 percent to 179,500 won as of 12:39
p.m. on the Korea Exchange, while the benchmark  Kospi  stock
index rose 0.3 percent. LG Chem advanced 4.3 percent to 313,000
won. L&F Co., a maker of materials used to make notebook
computer batteries, climbed 5 percent to 23,200 won.  
 South Korea plans to invest as much as 15 trillion won
($12.5 billion) in rechargeable battery technology by 2020 to
boost competitiveness, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in
a statement yesterday. Obama said in his first address to a
joint session of Congress on Feb. 24 last year that while new
hybrid cars roll off U.S. assembly lines, “they will run on
batteries made in Korea.”  
 “It’s meaningful in that the government’s plan supports
increasingly visible growth in the rechargeable battery
market,” analysts at Mirae Asset Securities Co. led by  Lee Hak Moo  wrote in a note today.  
 TechnoSemiChem Co. , which makes rechargeable battery
electrolytes, gained 1.6 percent to 24,850 won.  SK Energy Co. ,
which produces lithium-ion battery separators, gained 3.1
percent to 115,500 won.  
 Battery makers have also outpaced the Kospi’s gain this
year.  Samsung SDI  has climbed 21 percent, while LG Chem has
jumped 37 percent, compared with the Kospi’s 2.8 percent
advance.
