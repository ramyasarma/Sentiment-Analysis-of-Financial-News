             Russia’s gross domestic product may
increase 3 percent this quarter from the same period last year
as government spending bolsters industial output, Renaissance
Capital said.  
 GDP may advance 0.9 percent from the second quarter, RenCap
said in a report today, raising its previous forecast from 0.7
percent.  
 “The main positive growth drivers appear to be related to
a direct impact of the government’s efforts to reinvigorate the
economy,” economists led by Alexei Moisseev said in the report.
