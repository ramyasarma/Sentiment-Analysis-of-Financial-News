             Somalia’s Islamist al-Shabaab
militia threatened to carry out attacks on the Burundian
capital, Bujumbura, unless the Central African nation withdraws
its forces from Somalia.  
 Al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamoud Rage spoke today
on a conference call in the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
