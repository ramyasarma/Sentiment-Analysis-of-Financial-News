             Aon Corp., the world’s largest
insurance broker, agreed to buy Hewitt Associates Inc. for $4.9
billion in cash and stock to expand its division advising
companies on employee pay and benefits.  
 Hewitt shareholders will receive $25.61 in cash and 0.6362
of an Aon share, valuing the offer at $50 a share, Chicago-based
Aon said in a statement. That’s 41 percent more than Hewitt’s
closing price on July 9.  
 The purchase is Aon’s biggest, surpassing its $1.4 billion
acquisition of reinsurance broker Benfield Group Ltd. in 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company, which
earns commissions by matching buyers and sellers of insurance,
is seeking to boost revenue with the purchase of Hewitt, which
provides payroll and consulting services to 3,000 clients.  
 “This merger will give us a broader portfolio of
innovative products and services focused on what we believe are
two of the most important topics in the global economy today:
risk and people,” Aon Chief Executive Officer Greg Case, 47,
said in the statement.  
 Aon dropped to $36.69 at 1:18 p.m. in Frankfurt trading,
down 4 percent from its $38.34 close in New York on July 9.  
 Aon will merge Lincolnshire, Illinois-based Hewitt with its
Aon Consulting unit and rename the division Aon Hewitt. The
company said it expects to reap $355 million in annual cost
saving by cutting back-office costs and overlapping managers.
Russ Fradin, chairman and CEO of Hewitt, will head the combined
division and report to Case.  
 Aon said it is paying about 7.5 times Hewitt’s forecast
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
for the 2010 fiscal year. Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan
Stanley will arrange a $1 billion three-year term loan and a
$1.5 billion bridge loan facility to help fund the cash element
of the deal.  
 Credit Suisse acted as a financial adviser to Aon and
Citigroup Inc. advised Hewitt on the deal. The purchase is
expected to complete by mid-November, Aon said.
