             Fraport AG , owner of the Frankfurt
airport, reported a 12 percent increase in passenger numbers
after its German hub handled a record number of flyers.  
 The Frankfurt airport posted a 7 percent increase in
passengers to 4.9 million last month, Fraport said in a
statement today, bringing Fraport’s total to 9.2 million.  
 Fraport  gained  the most in a month, rising 1.7 percent to
37.38 euros as of 9:15 a.m. in Frankfurt trading. The stock has
added 2.8 percent this year, valuing the Frankfurt-based company
at 3.4 billion euros ($4.3 billion).  
 Freight transport at the Frankfurt airport also reached a
record last month, jumping 30 percent to 192,508 metric tons,
the company said.  
 “These numbers prove that the financial and economic
crisis is over and that air traffic is on a good way to reach or
surpass the results from before the crisis,” Chief Executive
Officer  Stefan Schulte  said in the statement.  
 In the first half, Fraport’s worldwide passenger numbers
increased 8.3 percent. A harsh winter, strikes by pilots of
Deutsche Lufthansa AG and a volcanic ash cloud that grounded
flights in April kept passenger growth at the Frankfurt airport
in check, the company said.
