             Corn dropped for a second straight
session and soybeans fell from the highest price since May on
speculation that rains will reduce the stress of  hot, dry
weather  in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and exporter.  
 As much as 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain fell from
Arkansas to Ohio during the past 72 hours, and more is expected
over the next two days, said  Allen Motew , a meteorologist at
Chicago-based QT Weather. Temperatures approaching 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) next week will be followed by
cooler and wetter weather, Motew said.  
 “The forecasts are less threatening with some of the
driest areas receiving rain,” said  Jerry Gidel , a market
analyst at North American Risk Management Services Inc. in
Chicago. “We are taking out some of the weather premiums.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 3.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.9175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  
 Before today, corn jumped 15 percent since June 29, the day
before the government said that U.S. farmers planted less than
they intended this year. On July 9, the price reached $3.98, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Jan. 12.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 2.25 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $9.51 a bushel, the first decline in four
sessions. Earlier, the price reached $9.6075, the highest level
since May 14.  
 A drop in crude oil also eroded the value of crops used to
make fuel, Gidel said. Oil fell for the first time in four
sessions as the dollar strengthened against the euro, reducing
the appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.  
 Stockpiles of U.S. ethanol rose to a record 19.9 million
barrels in the week ended July 2 from 19.5 million a week
earlier, the U.S. Energy Department said in a  report  July 8.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.
