             Eni SpA , Italy’s biggest oil
company, and Angolan state oil company Sonangol SA found a new
oil field off the coast of Angola, Sonangol spokesman Joao Rosa
Santos said.  
 The field, named Cabaca SE-1, is located on Block 15/06,
100 kilometers (62 miles) off the southwest African nation’s
coastline, Santos said in an interview in the capital, Luanda,
today. The field was drilled in 470 meters (1,542 feet) of water
and lies 4,221 meters below the surface of the ocean, Santos
said.  
 Eni and Sonangol plan to drill in the third quarter of this
year to assess the field, Angola Press Agency  reported  today.
Eni has a 35 percent interest in the block, while Total E&P and
Sonangol each hold 15 percent.
