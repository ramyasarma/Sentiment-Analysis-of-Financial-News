             The rand weakened for a second day
against the dollar after precious metal prices declined and
investors speculated positive sentiment toward South Africa will
dissipate following the ending of the soccer World Cup.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest economy depreciated as
much as 0.6 percent to 7.6408 per dollar and traded at 7.6087 by
4:20 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.5988.  
 Prices for gold and platinum, which account for about a
fifth of South Africa’s export earnings, fell as a stronger
dollar curbed investor demand for precious metals. As many as
half a million foreign visitors will begin leaving South Africa
today following yesterday’s final match of the 2010 World Cup,
on which the country spent about 43 billion rand ($5.64
billion).  
 “The dollar’s making a bit of a comeback and we’ve also
seen guys selling rand because of fears of a bit of a World Cup
hangover,” said  Marc Copeland , a currency trader at Investec
Asset Management in Cape Town. “A lot of good news was priced
into the tournament and now it’s over it’s causing some guys to
nudge the rand a little bit weaker.”  
 RBC Capital said in February that investors may sell the
rand after the World Cup final on bets positive sentiment may
erode. Though South Africa drew praise for successfully hosting
the event, the country still grapples with the world’s highest
AIDS infection rate while 2.1 million people are on waiting
lists for public housing and the 25.2 percent  jobless rate  is
the highest of 62 countries tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Gold, Platinum  
 Gold declined as much as 0.8 percent to $1,201.48 an ounce
while platinum slid as much as 0.9 percent to $1,517.60 an
ounce. The precious metals are South Africa’s biggest exports,
typically causing the rand to move in tandem with their prices.  
 Government bonds rose for a fifth day, with South Africa’s
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 climbing 48
cents to 124.29 rand. The yield on the bond fell 10 basis points
to 7.70 percent.  
 Investors pared bets the central bank will lower its 6.5
percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next meets on July 22,
forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month contracts
for cash in three months  rose for the first time in nine days,
climbing 1.5 basis points to 6.30 percent.
