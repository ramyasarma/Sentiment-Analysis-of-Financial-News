             The U.S. Postal Service and the
Commerce Department said they will work to help small and
medium-size businesses ship exports through the post office’s
international services, which include a  FedEx Corp.  partnership.  
 The joint effort is aimed at contributing to President
 Barack Obama ’s campaign to double U.S. exports while helping the
mailing agency as it struggles with declining volume and
revenue.  
 “We know that American businesses produce world-class
goods and services,” Commerce Secretary  Gary Locke  said today
at a news conference in Washington on the initiative. “What we
can improve on is connecting those businesses to the 95 percent
of the world’s consumers living outside our borders.”  
 Obama said last week his administration is increasing
access to export financing for small and medium-size U.S.
businesses while removing barriers to trade.  
 He also said  Ford Motor Co.  Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  is among executives joining an advisory panel to help
boost exports to create jobs.
