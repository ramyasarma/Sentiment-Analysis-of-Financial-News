             Asics Corp. , the Japanese maker of
the Onitsuka Tiger sporting-goods brand, will buy Swedish
outdoor gear company Haglofs Holding AB to expand abroad.  
 Asics will spend 11.4 billion yen ($128 million) to buy all
of the shares in Haglofs in August, according to a filing to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. The acquisition will have little impact on
earnings for the year ending March 31, Kobe-based Asics said.  
 “Haglofs is very similar to us in terms of manufacturing
skill and attitude,” Asics spokesman  Toshiyuki Sano , said today
by telephone. “We want to expand globally, and this will
strengthen our business.”  
 Haglofs, owned by Stockholm-based investment firm  Ratos AB ,
started making backpacks in 1914 and sells clothing and hiking
gear mainly in Europe, according to its  website .
