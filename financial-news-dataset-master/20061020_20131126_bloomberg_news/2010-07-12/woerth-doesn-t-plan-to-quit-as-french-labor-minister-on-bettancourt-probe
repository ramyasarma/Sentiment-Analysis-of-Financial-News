             French labor minister Eric Woerth
said he hasn’t thought of resigning from his post in recent
weeks after a preliminary inquiry was launched to study tax
refunds given to the country’s richest woman, L’Oreal SA heiress
Liliane Bettencourt. He made the comments in an interview with
Europe1 radio today.  
 Woerth told the interviewer that French President Nicolas
Sarkozy has shown confidence in him, though didn’t role out the
possibility that he might have to resign at some point amid
questions about potential conflict of interest in his having
allowed a tax refund to Bettancourt in 2008, he said during the
radio interview. Woerth was overseeing the tax office and his
wife was a financial adviser to Bettencourt when the tax refunds
were awarded. Woerth said his wife has since resigned from that
job.
