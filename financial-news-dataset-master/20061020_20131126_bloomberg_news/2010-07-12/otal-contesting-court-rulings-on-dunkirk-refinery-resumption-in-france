             Total SA , Europe’s largest refiner,
has filed two legal motions contesting rulings on the Dunkirk
refinery in northern France that it shut in September because of
falling demand for fuels such as diesel.  
 Total is disputing a June 30 Douai Court of Appeal ruling
ordering it to restart the facility by July 16, Frederic Texier,
a Paris-based company spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview. The refiner is also asking the Nanterre Court to
“recognize that Total followed the rules in informing unions
and consulting with staff” about plans for the site, he said.  
 Total has to pay 100,000 euros ($125,870) a day in the
event the refinery isn’t restarted, according to the Douai Court
of Appeal ruling. The court found that the company didn’t follow
proper procedures for informing workers about its plans for a
permanent shutdown, according to the ruling.  
 The case was brought by labor unions that opposed the oil
company’s decision to shutter the plant, which lost more than
130 million euros last year. To protest the closure, Total
workers embarked on nationwide strikes in February, leading to
fuel shortages.  
 The Dunkirk refinery in Flanders can process 141,000
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
