             Coffee prices fell on speculation
that this year’s rally went too far amid increasing production.
Cocoa dropped.  
 Global coffee output may rise 12 percent to 135 million
bags next season, led by gains in Brazil, the world’s largest
grower, the International Coffee Organization said last week. A
bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). Arabica futures
have gained 20 percent this year, and robusta has climbed 32
percent.  
 “That Brazilian harvest is continuing” to weigh on
prices, said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision Financial
Markets in Chicago. Arabica “ got dragged up with tightness of
supplies” in robusta, and the rally “was overdone,” he said.  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery fell 0.3 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $1.6355 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Robusta futures for September delivery dropped $4, or 0.2
percent, to $1,705 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in London.  
 “It is a bit of a pullback,” said  Eldred Buck , the
managing director of Eiger Trading Advisors Ltd. in London.  
 Arabica is grown mainly in Latin America and brewed by
specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta beans,
used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly in Asia and parts
of Africa.  
 Brazil will boost output in the year that begins Oct. 1 to
50 million bags from 39.5 million bags a year earlier, the
London-based international coffee group said.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery declined $7, or 0.2
percent, to $2,989 a ton in New York. The contract for September
delivery rose 1 pound to 2,386 pounds ($3,583) a ton in London.
