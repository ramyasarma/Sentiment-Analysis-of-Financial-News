             Avon Products Inc. , the world’s
largest door-to-door cosmetics seller, agreed to buy jewelry
company Silpada Designs Inc. for at least $650 million to
broaden its product line.  
 Avon will make a potential additional payment in early 2015
to current Silpada shareholders if earnings growth targets are
achieved, New York-based Avon said today in a statement. The
purchase may add 3 cents to 5 cents a share in 2011 profit.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Andrea Jung  has pursued
acquisitions to expand beyond beauty products, which accounted
for more than 70 percent of Avon’s $10 billion in sales last
year. Closely held Silpada, with  operations  in the U.S., Canada
and the U.K., gives Avon control of the largest and fastest-
growing direct seller of sterling silver jewelry.  
 Silpada has annual sales of about $230 million, and most of
its jewelry pieces sell for more than Avon’s current products,
according to the statement. In February, Avon Chief Financial
Officer  Chuck Cramb  called jewelry a "$100 billion mass market
opportunity.”  
 Avon  rose  15 cents to $28.42 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have dropped 9.8 percent
this year.  
 Avon plans to fund the purchase with cash on hand and
through commercial paper, according to spokeswoman Jennifer
Vargas. The company had $1.12 billion in  cash  and cash
equivalents as of March 31.  
 Centerview Partners LLC provided financial advice to Avon
on the transaction, while Lazard Middle Market LLC offered
counsel to Silpada. Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Lathrop & Gage
LLP served as legal advisers.  
 Party Sales  
 Silpada, based in Lenexa, Kansas, will keep operating as a
standalone business with its 32,000 independent sales
representatives. The company’s representatives invite customers
to at-home parties where they demonstrate the product.  
 Avon’s  fashion unit products, which include jewelry,
watches and footwear, accounted for about 17 percent of total
sales in 2009. The company sells makeup and other items to women
in more than 100 countries through about 6.2 million independent
sales representatives.
