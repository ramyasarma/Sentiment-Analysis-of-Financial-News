             Fairholme Capital Management , the
investment firm run by  Bruce Berkowitz , increased its bet on the
recovery of U.S. financial firms by buying an 11.1 percent stake
in MBIA Inc., the world’s largest bond insurer.  
 Funds managed by Berkowitz held 22.7 million shares in the
Armonk, New York-based insurer, the asset manager said today in
a regulatory filing. Berkowitz is the second-biggest holder of
MBIA stock after Warburg Pincus, according to Bloomberg  data .  
 Fairholme, already the biggest non-government shareholder
in bailed-out insurer  American International Group Inc. ,
announced today it had boosted its stake in the company. The
investment firm reported holding about 32.8 million AIG shares.
That’s up from a previously reported holding of 25.5 million
shares.  
 Berkowitz, named the U.S. domestic stock fund manager of
the decade in January by Chicago-based Morningstar Inc., has
made other large bets on financial firms. Fairholme owns the
largest stake in lender CIT Group Inc. and the second-biggest in
 Regions Financial Corp.   
 Berkowitz’s stake in MBIA was valued at about $146 million,
based on the closing price today of $6.43 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The firm has gained 62 percent in trading this year,
after plunging by more than  70 percent  in each of the years 2007
and 2008, and slipping 2.2 percent last year.  
 Kevin Brown , spokesman for MBIA, and  Hedda Nadler  of
Fairholme Capital declined to comment.
