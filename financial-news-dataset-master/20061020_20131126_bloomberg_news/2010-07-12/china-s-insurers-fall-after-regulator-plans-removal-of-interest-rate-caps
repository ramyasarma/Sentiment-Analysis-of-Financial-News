             China Life Insurance Co.  and China
Pacific Insurance (Group) Co. tumbled in Shanghai trading after
the regulator said it plans to remove a cap on interest rates
for some life insurance contracts, scrapping a decade-old
ceiling that helped contain price competition.  
 China Life , the nation’s biggest insurer, fell 6.7 percent,
the most since November 28, 2008, to 23 yuan as of 10:02 a.m.
local time.  China Pacific  declined 6.7 percent. Ping An
Insurance (Group) Co. shares are suspended.  
 China Insurance Regulatory Commission  said July 9  it plans
to allow insurers to decide the preset interest rates, which
insurers use to estimate future investment yields when pricing
contracts, on “conventional” life insurance policies. The
higher the interest rate is, the cheaper the insurance policies
are for customers.  
 Companies were asked to submit their feedback to the
proposal by July 20, according to the statement. The regulator
cut the ceiling on preset interest rates for all life insurance
policies at 2.5 percent in 1999. Conventional life insurance
refers to contracts with premiums and policyholder benefits
already set when they are written, the regulator said.  
 The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index  advanced 0.6 percent.
