             Irish Prime Minister  Brian Cowen 
said  Allied Irish Banks Plc , the country’s second-biggest
lender, may need more state support to meet new capital targets.  
 Dublin-based  Allied Irish  has until the end of the year to
raise 7.4 billion euros ($9.3 billion) to reach new capital
levels set by the country’s financial regulator.  
 Allied Irish “may need some help, but we will provide
that,” Cowen said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“InBusiness” with Margaret Brennan in New York today. “They
have to sell some of their assets that are non-core.”  
 Allied Irish is disposing of stakes in  M&T Bank Corp.  in
the U.S. and  Bank Zachodni WBK SA  in Poland as part of its plan
to raise the capital.  UniCredit SpA  and  HSBC Holdings Plc 
withdrew from the bidding for the Polish lender, a person with
knowledge of the negotiations said today.  Catherine Burke , a
spokeswoman for Allied Irish, declined to comment.  
 Ireland’s government controls an 18 percent stake in Allied
Irish after pumping 3.5 billion euros into the bank last year as
bad debts surged. Cowen’s government has said it’s ready to
provide more aid if needed as the economy emerges from the
recession in the first quarter.  
 Allied Irish  fell 2.2 percent to 90 cents in Dublin, giving
it a market value of 982 million euros.
