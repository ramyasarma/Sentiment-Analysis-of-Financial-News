             Brazil’s real fell for the first
time in four days as China’s money supply grew the least since
December 2008, raising speculation a slowdown in its economy
will cut demand for the South American nation’s exports.  
 The real declined 0.4 percent to 1.7629 per dollar at 12:56
p.m. New York time, from 1.7554 on July 9. The currency earlier
dropped as much as 0.6 percent, the most on an intraday basis
since June 29.  
 M2, the broadest measure of China’s money supply, slowed
for the seventh straight month, growing 18.5 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 21 percent in May. Lending growth slowed
for the third month, reflecting government curbs on credit to
some industries, the central bank said. China is Brazil’s
biggest trading partner.  
 “If you expect China to slow down more rapidly than what
has already been priced in, then it’ll slow economic growth in
Brazil as well,” said  Ram Bala Chandran , a Latin America
currency and rates analyst at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “Most
of the export growth in Brazil has been towards China, and if
that slows, it’ll negatively impact Brazil’s trade balance and
that will negatively affect the currency.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January 2012 fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 11.85 percent.  
 A July 9 Brazilian central bank survey of about 100
economists showed Brazil’s inflation may hit 5.45 percent this
year, compared with a week-earlier forecast of 5.55 percent.  
 “There’s a cooling of the very strong momentum we’ve seen
in Brazil, and inflation expectations are starting to become
affected,” said  Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin America fixed-
income research at IDEAglobal in New York. “As inflation
expectations are modified by investors, that’s being reflected
in the DI curve.”
