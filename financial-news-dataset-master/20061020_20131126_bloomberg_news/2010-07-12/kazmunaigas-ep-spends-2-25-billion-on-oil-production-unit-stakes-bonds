             KazMunaiGas Exploration Production ,
the London-traded arm of Kazakhstan’s state oil producer, plans
to spend $2.25 billion buying stakes in three oil production
units as well as bonds from its parent company.  
 KazMunaiGas EP will pay $750 million for stakes in three
oil production units, the Astana-based company said in a
statement today. It also “intends to purchase” 220 billion
tenge ($1.5 billion) of three-year bonds that will be issued by
KazMunaiGaz National Co.  
 The purchase of the stakes will boost KazMunaiGas’s oil
production by almost a third, and result in an increase in
proven and probable reserves of 406 million barrels. The parent
company aims to become one of the world’s 30 biggest oil
producers by 2015.  
 KazMunaiGas EP will be able to use the bonds to pay for
future acquisitions of the parent’s assets, Alexander Gladyshev,
head of investor relations, said by telephone from the Astana.
The parent company will offset future dividends from the unit
against outstanding bonds.  
 KazMunaiGaz National confirmed that it is considering the
transfer of a number of new exploration blocks to KazMunaiGas EP
later this year.  
 Investment  
 KazMunaiGaz National said in April it plans to invest $4.3
billion this year in production, refining and pipelines, and
refinancing existing debt. The company sold $1.5 billion of 10-
year bonds in April to finance expansion plans.  
 Moody’s Investors Service said June 11 that KazMunaiGaz is
expected to use the proceeds raised from the bond sale to its
subsidiary to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.  
 KazMunaiGas EP will buy 50 percent of Kazakhoil Aktobe LLP
for $350 million, half of Mangistau Investments BV for $330
million and 51 percent of Kazakturkmunai Ltd for $70 million.
The cash component of acquisitions will be financed by the
company’s own funds.  
 Separately, KazMunaiGas EP will “gradually reduce” the
maximum amount that can be held in Kazkommertsbank and Halyk
Savings Bank, the nation’s two largest lenders by assets, to
$750 million by the end of 2011 from more than $3 billion,
Gladyshev said.
