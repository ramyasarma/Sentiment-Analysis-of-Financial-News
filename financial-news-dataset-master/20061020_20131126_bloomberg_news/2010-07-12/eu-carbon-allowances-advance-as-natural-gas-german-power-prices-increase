             European Union carbon allowances
rose as natural gas prices and German power advanced, boosting
demand for emission permits.  
 EU permits for December gained 0.4 percent to 14.71 euros
($18.53) a metric ton as of 8:06 a.m. on London’s European
Climate Exchange. They’re up 2.5 percent from a seven-week low
of 14.35 euros on July 9.  
 German baseload power for next month added 0.7 percent to
46 euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker prices compiled by
Bloomberg. Higher power prices can increase the incentive to
sell electricity forward, boosting demand for emission permits.  
 U.K. natural gas for delivery next month advanced 1.4
percent to 50.9 pence a therm. Higher gas prices may prompt some
power utilities to burn more coal, which requires about twice as
many carbon permits to use.
