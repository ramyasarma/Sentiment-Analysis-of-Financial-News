             Gold exchange-traded product inflows
surged more than 11-fold in the U.S. and Europe in the second
quarter, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  
 Investment climbed to $11.6 billion, the bank said in a
report dated today and given to reporters in London. In the
prior quarter, inflows were $224 million in the U.S. and 547
million euros ($687 million) in Europe, or about $981 million
based on the average currency rate in the period.  
 The second-quarter total “easily surpassed the cumulative
gold inflows of the past five consecutive quarters put
together,” strategists including  Christos Costandinides  said in
the report.  
 Assets in gold-backed products and bullion prices climbed
together to a record in the past month on investor demand stoked
by Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and on concern that the global
economic recovery may slow. The MSCI World Index of equities
slid 13 percent in the second quarter and the Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index of 19 raw materials declined 5.4 percent.  
 Gold-product inflows in the U.S. fell 52 percent to $2.31
billion in June, while European investment slid 61 percent to
687.7 million euros, Deutsche Bank said. In May, inflows more
than quadrupled in both the U.S. and Europe compared with April.  
 Deutsche Bank is one of the five lenders that carry out the
twice-daily  “fixing”  of gold prices in London, along with
Barclays Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Bank of Nova Scotia and Societe
Generale SA.  
 Global gold  assets  held by exchange-traded products were
little changed near a record at 2,072.4 metric tons on July 9,
according to Bloomberg data from 10 providers. Bullion for
immediate delivery traded at $1,204.65 an ounce at 3:19 p.m. in
London. The metal reached a record $1,265.30 on June 21 and is
up 9.8 percent this year, headed for a 10th annual gain.
