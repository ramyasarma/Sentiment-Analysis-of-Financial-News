             Colombia plans to sell $500 million
worth of peso bonds due in 2021 in international markets, a week
after the country’s credit-rating outlook was raised to positive
by Standard & Poor’s on optimism President-elect  Juan Manuel Santos ’s plan to create a stabilization fund will boost growth.  
 The country may sell the securities as soon as today, said
a person familiar with offering, who declined to be identified
because terms aren’t set. Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of America
Corp. will arrange the sale, according to a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filing. Colombia initially sold about $800
million worth of the 7.75 percent securities, known as Global
TES, on April 7.  
 S&P lifted the outlook on Colombia’s BB+ rating, or one
level below investment grade, on July 7, saying the fund will
increase the economy’s “resilience.” Santos is slated to take
office Aug. 7. The government is also taking advantage of
renewed demand for emerging-market assets that pushed yields on
the 2021 notes to the lowest level since they were issued.  
 “The government is taking a holistic strategy of first
announcing changes and then coming to the market with that
positive inertia,”  Vitali Meschoulam , an emerging-market
strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York, said in a phone
interview from New York. “There is relative calm in external
markets, which will also help appetite for the debt.”

 The yield on the 2021 bonds fell to 6.60 percent last week,
tying a low reached June 24, according to Bogota-based brokerage
Correval SA. It climbed 10 basis points today to 6.70 percent,
leaving the yield down 75 points since April 12. A basis point
equals 0.01 percentage point.  
 Colombia on July 2 announced plans to sell an additional $1
billion abroad, of which $500 million will be in overseas bonds
and $500 million from multilateral lenders, to replace revenue
from the scrapped sale of power company Isagen SA, Finance
Minister Oscar Ivan Zuluaga said July 2.  
 The South American nation’s plans to tap the international
market follows Mexico’s sale of 850 million euros ($1.07
billion) of seven-year bonds last week.  
 Colombia’s strong peso also boosts the attractiveness of
Global TES, according to Meschoulam.  
 The peso has jumped 8.9 percent this year, the best
performance among world currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
currency fell 0.2 percent to 1,876.90 per U.S. dollar at 12:30
p.m. New York time from 1,873.55 at the end of last week.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell seven basis points to 7.6 percent, according to
Colombia’s stock exchange. That’s its lowest level on a closing
basis since April 2006. The bond’s price climbed 0.543 centavo
to 123.269 centavos per peso.
