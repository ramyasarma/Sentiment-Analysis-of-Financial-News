             Ukraine’s  Finance Ministry  said it
will help the capital, Kiev, repay its domestic and foreign debt
this year, First Deputy Minister Vadym Kopylov.  
 “Ukraine’s Cabinet and the Kiev administration will
further take steps to ensure Kiev city’s budget has enough funds
to hold an efficient debt policy,” Kopylov said today in a
statement, e-mailed by the ministry press office today. Kiev’s
2011 dollar bonds rose to 96 cents on the dollar, the highest
since July 2, pushing the yield down to 13.016 percent,
Bloomberg data shows.  
 Kiev is likely to restructure principal of its $200 million
of notes due 2011 and $250 million of bonds due 2012, while
continuing to meet interest payments, said an unidentified
official in the city’s administration on July 5.  
 “Recent contradictory statements by city of Kiev officials
on a possible restructuring are linked to a de-facto takeover of
the city government by central authorities,” said  Kaan Nazli ,
director at New York-based Medley Global Advisors LLC in an e-
mailed note today. They “are likely to result in a
restructuring offer later this year.”  
 Nazli said that “if the restructuring does take place, it
will weigh on the sentiment of sovereign bonds as well as other
Ukrainian corporates and quasi-sovereigns.”  
 The restructuring “would trigger concern that more
restructuring would be on the way, despite the recent
improvement in sovereign credit ratings and the  International
Monetary Fund  backstop,” he said.  
 The IMF said on July 3 it agreed a $14.9 billion loan for
Ukraine to replace an existing program and the government this
month plans to sell its first Eurobonds since 2007 to help cover
its deficit.
