             Brazil economists  reduced  their
estimates for  inflation  and the central bank’s benchmark lending
rate after consumer prices were little changed in June.  
 Consumer prices may climb 5.45 percent in 2010, according
to the median forecast in a July 9 central bank survey of about
100 economists published today. The analysts had predicted
inflation of 5.55 percent in last week’s survey.  
 The survey reflects June’s lower-than-expected inflation,
said  Andre Perfeito , an economist at Gradual Investimentos. The
benchmark IPCA index was unchanged in June from May while the
annual rate fell for a second month to 4.84 percent, the
statistics agency reported July 7. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had forecast monthly inflation of 0.11 percent and
4.96 percent annual inflation.  
 “The scenario is much more benign for inflation after the
latest indicators slowed a lot,” Perfeito said in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo.  
 The central bank will raise the benchmark Selic to 11
percent at next week’s meeting, taking the rate to 12 percent by
year end, the survey showed. Economists forecast the Selic would
end 2010 at 12.13 percent in last week’s survey.  
 Perfeito sees consumer prices rising 5.4 percent this year
and the Selic rate at 12 percent by the end of the year.  
 12-Month Forecast, Rates  
 Latin America’s biggest economy expanded at the  fastest
pace  since 1995 in the first quarter, led by domestic demand and
a record surge in investments. The central bank raised interest
rates twice this year to 10.25 percent from a record low 8.75
percent in March in a bid to slow economic growth.  
 Economists raised their estimate for inflation in the next
12 months to 4.90 percent from 4.86 percent a week earlier, the
survey showed. The central bank  targets  a 4.5 percent target,
plus or minus 2 percentage points.  
 Brazil’s benchmark inflation rate may stay above the
government’s 4.5 percent midpoint target until the second
quarter of 2012, the central bank said in its quarterly
inflation report June 30.  
 While annual inflation has exceeding the target throughout
2010, June’s month-on-month reading of 0.0 percent was the
lowest since prices fell in June 2006.  
 Yields on interest-rate future contracts maturing in 2011
and 2012 fell today.  
 The yield on interest rate future contract due January 2012
declined five basis points to 11.85 percent from 11.90 percent
on July 8. Sao Paulo markets were closed on July 9 in observance
of Battle of 1932 Day.  
 The real weakened 0.5 percent to 1.7637 per U.S. dollar at
11:26 a.m. New York time.
