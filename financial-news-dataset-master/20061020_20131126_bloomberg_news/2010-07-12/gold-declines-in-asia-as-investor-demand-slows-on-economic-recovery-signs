             Gold futures fell as the dollar’s
rally eroded demand for the precious metal as an alternative
asset.  
 The greenback gained as much as 0.6 percent against a
basket of six major currencies. Last week, investment in the
SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund backed by
bullion, dropped 0.4 percent, ending a 10-week climb. Gold
prices have dropped 5.4 percent from a record $1,266.50 an ounce
on June 21.  
 “The dollar is holding gold back,” said  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “There isn’t much
fear at the moment to make people rush in and buy gold.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery dropped $11.10, or 0.9
percent, to $1,198.80 on the Comex in New York. The metal has
climbed 9.4 percent this year.  
 Bets on higher prices by hedge-fund managers and other
large speculators dropped.  Speculative long positions 
outnumbered short positions by 209,042 contracts on the Comex in
the week ended July 6, down 15 percent from a week earlier,
government data showed.  
 “The highs for gold have been seen for the year,” said
 Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset Management in
Evanston, Illinois.  
 U.S. Borrowing Costs  
 Gold historically has moved inversely to the dollar. Last
month, the metal also rose to all-time highs in euros, U.K.
pounds and Swiss francs amid Europe’s sovereign-debt woes.  
 “Gold is stronger in non-U.S. dollar terms than it is in
dollar terms,” said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor
of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter. Gartman has
recommended selling euros and buying gold.  
 Gold will retreat once the Federal Reserve begins to raise
borrowing costs, said Kaplan of Prospector Asset Management. The
Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero percent to 0.25
percent since December 2008 to spur growth.  
 “Gold has been strong because there’s nowhere else to put
your money,” Kaplan said. “But there’s going to be a rise in
interest rates fairly soon.”  
 Silver futures for September delivery fell 15.6 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $17.917 an ounce.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery declined $17.90, or
1.2 percent, to $1,515.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery dropped $2.80, or
0.6 percent, to $454.15 an ounce.
