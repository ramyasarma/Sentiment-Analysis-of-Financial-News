             The Czech Public Affairs party
approved in a referendum its entry to the country’s next
Cabinet, which wants to cut state spending and reduce the  budget 
deficit.  
 Party members and supporters approved the move in a web-
based vote that ended today, Public Affairs said in a statement
on its  website . It will govern with the Civic Democratic Party
and TOP09 after the three won 118 of parliament’s 200 seats in
May 28-29 elections.  
 The parties, which already agreed to cut the public finance
deficit to 4.8 percent of  gross domestic product  next year from
5.3 percent targeted this year, plan to sign the coalition
agreement today at 6 p.m. in Prague.
