             China’s  exports  rebound last month
will ease concern that a global slowdown hurt demand for the
country’s goods, bolstering investor sentiment, according to
Deutsche Bank AG.  
 Overseas shipments jumped 43.9 percent in June to $137.4
billion and the trade surplus more than doubled to $20 billion,
the highest in eight months, the government said July 10.  
 “The impact of the European sovereign debt crisis on
Chinese exports has been much smaller than feared and will
likely remain modest” in the third quarter,  Jun Ma , chief China
economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note to clients today.
“This data point will provide a slight support for market
sentiment in the very short term, as it helps ease some
investors’ concern on the impact of global deceleration on
China’s export performance.”  
 The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index  last week had its
biggest weekly gain of the year on speculation the government
will wind back tightening measures that helped make the gauge
Asia’s worst performer in 2010. The measure has slid as much as
28 percent this year on concern European austerity measures will
damp imports of goods.  
 The index climbed 0.2 percent to 2,476.06 as of 9:51 a.m.  
 Sales to the EU and U.S., China’s two biggest markets, rose
by about 40 percent in June, the customs bureau reported.
Exports to Brazil more than doubled, those to Russia jumped 84
percent and shipments to India surged 59 percent as China
targeted emerging markets to cushion reduced demand from
developed economies.  
 Deustche Bank’s Ma said he remains “cautiously
optimistic” about the outlook for China’s exports in the coming
months. He predicts overseas sales growth will slow to about 32
percent from a year ago in the third quarter from 40 percent in
the April-to-June period.

                          July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Ben Simpfendorfer, chief China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, talks with Bloomberg's Linzie Janis about the implications of sovereign debt crisis in Europe on China's exports to the region. 
     China’s unexpected rebound in overseas shipments to a record last month may lose pace as the European crisis, a moderating U.S. recovery and yuan gains curb demand for goods from the world’s largest exporter. Simpfendorfer, speaking from Hong Kong, also discusses China's currency policy and property market.
