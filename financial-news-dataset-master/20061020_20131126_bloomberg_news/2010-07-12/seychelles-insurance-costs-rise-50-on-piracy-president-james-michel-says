             Piracy in the Indian Ocean has
prompted insurance costs to soar in the Seychelles, at the
same time driving down ports and fishery revenue, Seychellois
President James Michel said today.  
 “Insurance costs have ballooned by 50 percent. Port and
fisheries receipts have declined by 30 percent,” Michel said
in an e-mailed statement. “While trade levels drop, anarchy
is being exported across our region,” he added.  
 Piracy caused the loss of 4 percent of the Seychelles’
GDP in 2009, said Michel.
