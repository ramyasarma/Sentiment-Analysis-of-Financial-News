             U.S. soybean crop conditions fell
last week as rain kept soils too wet in parts of the western
Midwest and dry weather stressed crops across southern and
eastern growing regions. Corn improved on warmer weather.  
 As of July 11, 65 percent of the soybean was rated good or
excellent, down from 66 percent a week earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today in a  report . Of the corn
crop, 73 percent was given top ratings, up from 71 percent.  
 “The corn crop is doing better than soybeans, but both
crops have been hurt by too much rain,” said  Michael Cordonnier , the president of the Corn and Soybeans Advisor Inc.
in Hinsdale, Illinois. “The crops are schizophrenic with some
improvement in spots and further deterioration in others,”
Cordonnier said, after logging 2,500 miles last week across
seven Midwestern states.  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 3.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.9175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. On
July 9, the price reached $3.98, the highest level for a most-
active contract since Jan. 12.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 2.25 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $9.51 a bushel, the first decline in four
sessions. Earlier, the price reached $9.6075, the highest level
since May 14.  
 The nation’s cotton crop improved, with 67 percent in good
or excellent condition as of July 11, up from 65 percent a week
earlier, the department said.  
 Spring-wheat  conditions  were unchanged at 83 percent good
or excellent this week. The USDA also said 63 percent of the
 winter-wheat crop  was harvested, up from 54 percent a week
earlier.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-biggest crop, valued at $10.6 billion,
behind hay.
