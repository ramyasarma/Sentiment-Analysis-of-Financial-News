             European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co.’s bid for a U.S. refueling tanker order may be below
previous offers in 2008 and 2009 as the company aims to undercut
 Boeing Co.  on pricing, Financial Times Deutschland reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 The refueling tanker based on the Airbus A330-200 may cost
at least 10 percent less than the last offer of 184 million
euros ($232 million) per aircraft, the newspaper said.
