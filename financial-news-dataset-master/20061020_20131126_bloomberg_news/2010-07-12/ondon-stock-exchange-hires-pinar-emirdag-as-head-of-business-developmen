             London Stock Exchange Group Plc 
hired  Pinar Emirdag , a former Turquoise board member, as head of
professional business development as Europe’s oldest independent
bourse seeks to lure back customers from new rivals.  
 Emirdag, who will start this week, will be responsible for
developing relations and business with the wholesale market
including investment banks, brokers and high-frequency traders,
 Nicolas Bertrand , head of equity and derivatives markets at LSE
said in an interview. Emirdag was previously head of business
development at ICAP Plc’s equities unit in London.  
 Emirdag, 38, was born in Istanbul and holds a doctorate in
in theoretical physics from Brown University in the U.S. She
joined Citigroup Inc. in London, where she was instrumental in
setting up Turquoise, a multilateral trading facility started by
the biggest investment banks to challenge traditional exchanges.
From Citigroup, Emirdag moved to the European arm of Liquidnet
Holdings Inc. and then joined ICAP.  
 Since starting in May last year, LSE Chief Executive
Officer  Xavier Rolet  has hired senior managers as he revamps the
exchange, attempting to stem its loss of market share to MTFs
such as Bats Europe and Chi-X Europe Ltd. He is also moving the
bourse onto a new trading system, changing fees and seeking to
diversify into new markets. Rolet last year took a majority
stake in Turquoise.  
 LSE, which holds its annual shareholder meeting on July 14,
swung to a profit in fiscal 2010 after writing down its purchase
of Borsa Italiana SpA last year. Net income for the year ended
March 2010 was 90.4 million pounds ($136 million) compared with
a loss of 338 million pounds last year.
