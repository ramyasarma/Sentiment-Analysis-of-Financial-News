             Former Queensland state government
minister Gordon Nuttall has been ordered to repay more than
A$450,000 that he received while in the role, the Australian
Financial Review reported, citing an order from Supreme Court
judge Peter Applegarth.  
 Nuttall received the money from two Brisbane businessmen
including the late Ken Talbot, the newspaper said. Talbot was
the former chief executive officer of Macarthur Coal Ltd. killed
in a plane crash last month. Nuttall is serving a seven-year
jail term for receiving the payments, the newspaper said.
