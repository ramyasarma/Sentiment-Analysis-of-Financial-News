             Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised
buying five-year Spanish bonds against equivalent-maturity
German securities on “encouraging policy initiatives,”
including stress tests for European banks.  
 Investors should bet the yield premium investors demand for
the Spanish debt will drop to 150 basis points,  Noah Weisberger ,
a New York-based trading strategist, wrote in a report received
today. They should end the bet if the spread closes at more than
210 basis points, he said.  
 “The recent policy initiatives have been encouraging,
particularly with respect to the stress tests,” he said.  
 The  yield spread  widened eight basis points to 209 basis
points as of 12:33 p.m. in London.
