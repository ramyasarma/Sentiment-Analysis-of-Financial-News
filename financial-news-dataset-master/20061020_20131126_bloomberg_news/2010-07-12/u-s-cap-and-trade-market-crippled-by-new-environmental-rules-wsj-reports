             The U.S. cap and trade market, which
curbed the emissions from mainly coal-fired power plants that 
caused so-called acid rain in the 1990s, has been crippled by 
new U.S. pollution laws, the Wall Street Journal reported, 
citing industry officials and analysts.  
 The market, where power producers trade permits that allow 
them to emit sulfur dioxide and other pollutants, now finds 
that new Environmental Protection Agency rules put tougher 
limits on emissions but stress less reliance on the trading 
aspect. the newspaper said.  
 The permits are now seen as being almost worthless; “It is
tragic,” ICAP Energy LLC analyst Gary Hart told the Journal. 
“It is something that worked so well.”
