             Australia’s acting high commissioner
to Fiji will be forced to leave today, the Australian newspaper
said, citing Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith.  
 The departure of Sarah Roberts follows a similar exit by
James Batley in November, the newspaper said. Smith said Fiji’s
decision is unjustified and disappointing, according to the
newspaper. Roberts had served as the deputy high commissioner to
Fiji since 2008, the newspaper said.
