             Soybeans rose for the third
consecutive session, erasing an earlier decline, after a
government report showed a surge in U.S. exports last week.  
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture inspected 6.515 million
bushels for export in the week ended July 8, more than double a
week earlier. U.S. inventories on Aug. 31 will be 175 million
bushels, 5.4 percent less than June’s projection, the USDA said
last week. On July 9, the  average cash price  rose 1 percent to
the highest level since January, exchange data show.  
 “There is good demand, and farmers are not selling,” said
 Chad Henderson , a market analyst for Prime Agricultural
Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin. “The cash market is
leading futures because there is nothing better to feed a bull
market than farmers holding back supplies.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery advanced 2.75 cents,
or 0.3 percent, to $9.56 a bushel at 12:05 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after dropping as much as 0.9 percent. The most-
active contract rose 5.2 percent last week, the most since the
week ended Nov 20.  
 The August futures contract, on which most spot-market cash
bids are based, jumped 11.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $10.0475
after rising as high as $10.0675, the most for the contract
since April 27.  
 The soybean crop in the U.S., the world’s largest grower,
was valued at $31.8 billion last year, second only to corn at
$48.6 billion, government figures show.
