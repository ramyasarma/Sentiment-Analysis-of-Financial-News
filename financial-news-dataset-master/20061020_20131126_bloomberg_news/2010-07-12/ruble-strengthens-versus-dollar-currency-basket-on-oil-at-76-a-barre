             The ruble climbed against the dollar
and the central bank’s target basket as crude oil traded above
$76 a barrel, boosting the outlook for the world’s biggest
energy exporter.  
 Russia’s currency strengthened 0.3 percent versus the
dollar to 30.8000 at the close in Moscow and gained 0.5 percent
to 34.3640 against the euro-dollar basket the central bank uses
to smooth exchange-rate fluctuations. The Russian currency was
0.7 percent higher at 38.7200 versus the euro. The government’s
benchmark dollar bonds due 2020 gained 0.3 percent, sending the
yield 3 basis points lower to 5.296 percent.  
 “The stronger ruble is reflective of what is still a
sustained high oil price,”  Tom Mundy , a Moscow-based strategist
at Renaissance Capital, said by phone today.  
 Crude oil, Russia’s chief export, added 23 cents to $76.32
a barrel at the close of official ruble trading in Moscow.  
 Investors pared bets that the ruble will weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 30.9731
per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of 31.0700 on
July 9. The contracts are a guide to expectations of currency
movements as they allow foreign investors and companies to fix
the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 Bank Rossii’s basket is calculated by multiplying the
dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by
0.45, then adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26
to 41 band the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
