             CEZ AS , the Czech Republic’s largest
power producer, dropped plans to build a gas-fired power plant
in the town of Galati in eastern Romania because of
“significant and unexpected” construction costs.  
 A feasibility study conducted over the past two years to
build a 400 megawatt plant at Galati showed the project is not
feasable because of high costs associated with gas pipelines and
demolition of some assets belonging to the Electrocentrale
Galati power plant, Prague-based CEZ said in an e-mail today.  
 CEZ had signed a memorandum with Romanian thermal generator
 Termoelectrica SA  in 2008 for a venture to expand and upgrade
the Electrocentrale Galati power plant. The Czech company also
owns a share in another Romanian venture to build and operate
two nuclear reactors at the country’s sole nuclear station
at Cernavoda and is currently building a 600 megawatt wind farm
in southeastern Dobrogea region near the Black Sea, which is
expected to be fully operational in 2011.  
 “This decision” to drop the project “was based on a few
technical parameters as well as on a series of relevant
financial aspects,” CEZ said. “Because of these crucial
factors, the CEZ Group decided to focus its financial resources
on the other ongoing businesses in Romania: the 600 megawatt
project at Fantanele and Cogealac and the participation in the
venture that will build the third and fourth nuclear reactors at
Cernavoda.”
