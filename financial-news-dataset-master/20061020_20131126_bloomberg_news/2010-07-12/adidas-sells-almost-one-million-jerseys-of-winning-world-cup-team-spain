             Adidas AG , the world’s second-
largest sporting goods maker, has sold almost one million
replica jerseys of the Spanish national team and has designed a
new version after Spain won the soccer World Cup yesterday.  
 Adidas, which sold more than a million jerseys of each of
the teams of Germany, Argentina, Mexico and South Africa,
shipped an additional 100,000 Spanish jerseys during the
monthlong tournament, spokesman  Jan Runau  said today in a
telephone interview from Johannesburg.  
 The Herzogenaurach-based company has started producing a
new version of the Spain shirt with one star in the emblem,
representing the World Cup victory. Adidas will start selling
it in the coming weeks, according to Runau. He also said that
Adidas will this year sell more than four million pairs of its
latest F50, the shoe that scored the most goals during the
tournament.  
 National team jerseys have a retail price of about 70
euros ($88) in Europe while a pair of F50 shoes costs about 200
euros.
