             England totaled 347-7 against
Bangladesh in today’s third and final one-day cricket
international at Edgbaston, helped by a record run-haul from
Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott.  
 After Craig Kieswetter was dismissed with only one run on
the board, the pair put on 250 for the second wicket, England’s
highest one-day international partnership, before Trott was
out for 110. Captain Strauss went on to total 154.  
 The visitors were on 64-3 at 4:35 p.m. after 10.3 overs.
Opening batsman Tamim Iqbal was out for 16, Imrul Kayes went for
4 and Junaid Siddique made 25.  
 The series is tied 1-1 after Bangladesh won by five runs
two days ago, its first win over England.  
 Bangladesh won the toss today and put England in to bat.
England left out James Anderson and the injured Ian Bell, and
included Tim Bresnan and Ravi Bopara. The Bangladesh lineup was
unchanged.
