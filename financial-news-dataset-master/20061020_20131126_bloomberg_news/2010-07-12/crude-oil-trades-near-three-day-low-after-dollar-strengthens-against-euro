             Crude oil rose for the fourth day in
five on optimism fuel demand will increase amid improved
prospects for an economic recovery in the U.S., the world’s
biggest energy consumer.  
 Oil pared some of yesterday’s 1.5 percent decline after
 Asian stocks  gained as better-than-estimated earnings from Alcoa
Inc. boosted confidence in the global economy. Prices also
climbed as the dollar declined against the euro, increasing the
appeal of commodities. U.S. crude supplies probably fell last
week, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “Alcoa is typically seen as a barometer for the overall
economy,”  Ben Potter , a market strategist at IG Markets in
Melbourne, said in an e-mailed note. “The fact that growth was
driven by stronger demand and higher volumes is very important,
indicating the economy’s still ticking along.”  
 Crude for August delivery gained as much as 43 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $75.38 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $75.28 at 9:06 a.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract fell $1.14 to $74.95,
the lowest close since July 7. Prices have declined 5.3 percent
this year.  
 U.S. crude oil supplies probably dropped 1.35 million
barrels in the seven days ended July 9, according to the median
estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Gasoline
inventories probably rose 350,000 barrels last week, the survey
showed before a government report tomorrow.  
 Oil fell yesterday as the dollar advanced amid speculation
that tests to demonstrate the resilience of Europe’s banking
system will fail to assure investors that the region is
recovering from its sovereign-debt crisis. The U.S. currency
traded at $1.2607 per euro at 10:41 a.m. Sydney time from
$1.2596 per euro in New York yesterday.  
 Brent crude for August settlement gained as much as 33
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $74.70 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange, and was at $74.62 at 8:56 a.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract dropped $1.05, or 1.4
percent, to $74.37.
