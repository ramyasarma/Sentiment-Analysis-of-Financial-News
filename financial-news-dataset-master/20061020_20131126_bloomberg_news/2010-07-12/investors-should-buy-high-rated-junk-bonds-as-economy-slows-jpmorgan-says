             Investors should buy BB and B rated
U.S. corporate bonds amid lower inflation and interest rates and
slowing economic growth, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said.  
 The default rate for high-yield, high-risk securities will
be 2 percent through the end of 2011, analysts led by  Peter Acciavatti  wrote July 9 in a research report. The U.S. economy
will grow 3.1 percent this year and 3 percent in 2011, JPMorgan
predicted.  
 “Positive growth but growth not powerful enough to produce
inflation and higher interest rates is a Goldilocks scenario for
high-yield,” the analysts wrote.  
 High-yield, or junk, debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. In
S&P’s ratings system, the first six levels below investment
grade range from BB+ to B-.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own junk bonds instead
of Treasuries will tighten to 525 basis points by the end of the
year, the analysts wrote. Spreads narrowed 10 basis points on
July 9 to 688 basis points, the third straight decline and the
biggest drop since June 21, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data.  
 Spreads imply a default rate of 5.9 percent, nearly triple
what the analysts forecast. Acciavatti couldn’t be reached for
comment on the report because he was traveling.
