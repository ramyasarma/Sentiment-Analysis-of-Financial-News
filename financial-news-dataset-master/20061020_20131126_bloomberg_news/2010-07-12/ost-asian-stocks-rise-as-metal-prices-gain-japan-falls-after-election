             Asian  stocks  fluctuated as gains
among mining companies on higher metal prices offset political
uncertainty in Japan that dragged down the country’s banks.  
 Rio Tinto Group , the world’s third-largest mining company,
rose 1 percent in Sydney. China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd.
led Hong Kong developers higher on speculation China will relax
curbs on the property market.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. , Japan’s biggest bank by market value, dropped 2.1 percent
after the country’s ruling party lost control of the upper house
of parliament in elections yesterday.  
 About the same number of stocks rose as fell on the  MSCI
Asia Pacific Index , which dropped 0.3 percent to 115.84 as of
4:53 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge has slumped 10 percent from its
high this year on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and
Chinese steps to curb property prices will hurt global growth.  
 “There are still a few political and economic
uncertainties on the horizon,” said  Nader Naeimi , a Sydney-based
strategist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which holds $90
billion.
