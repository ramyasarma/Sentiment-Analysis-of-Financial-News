             Australia’s dollar fell from its
highest level in almost three weeks on a drop in imports of iron
ore and copper by China, the nation’s biggest trading partner.  
 “The import data highlighted that there was a decline in
Chinese imports of iron ore and copper, and there’s some fears
that that could weigh on growth,” said  Camilla Sutton , a Bank
of Nova Scotia currency strategist in Toronto.  
 Australia’s currency slid 0.3 percent to 87.48 U.S. cents
at 1:40 p.m. in New York, from 87.76 cents on July 9. It earlier
touched 87.93 cents, the highest since June 22. New Zealand’s
dollar dropped 0.1 percent to 70.98 U.S. cents. It increased to
71.17 cents on July 9, the highest since June 28.  
 Shipments of copper to China declined 17 percent to 328,231
metric tons in June, the customs office said July 10. That
compares with May’s 396,712 tons and is 31 percent less than
477,220 tons a year earlier, according to Bloomberg
calculations.  
 Iron ore imports by China dropped 9 percent to 47.2 million
metric tons in June from 51.9 million tons in the previous
month, according to data provided by the General Administration
of Customs. Imports fell 15 percent from 55.3 million tons a
year earlier.
