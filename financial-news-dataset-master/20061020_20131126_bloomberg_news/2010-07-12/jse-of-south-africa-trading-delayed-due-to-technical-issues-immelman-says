             Equity trading on South Africa’s
stock market started an hour and a half late after a technical
glitch caused international connectivity problems.  
 The market opened at 10:30 a.m. local time, with sales of
warrants and investment products moving to continuous trading at
10:40 a.m., the Johannesburg-based exchange said in an e-mailed
statement today. Trading was delayed “due to a JSE technical
issue affecting the exchange’s international connectivity on the
equities market,” the exchange, which is a unit of  JSE Ltd. ,
said in a statement distributed by its public relations agency.  
 “For many traders this is lost time and money,”  Garth Mackenzie , a derivatives trader at Imara S.P. Reid, said by
phone from Johannesburg. “The JSE does seem to go down more
often than most developed market exchanges.”  
 The market open was also delayed on Nov. 30, with trading
in shares starting at 9:50 a.m. local because of a technical
glitch.  
 South Africa’s stock market halted equity trading for the
longest period in at least eight years on July 14, 2008, opening
at 3:10 p.m. after a network problem prevented data from being
disseminated, costing brokers lost sales. The problem affected
data, including the Stock Exchange News Service and equity
trading from the 9 a.m. open until late that afternoon.  
 The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  declined for the first
day in five, drilling 0.6 percent to 27,100.91 as of 10:47 a.m.
in Johannesburg.
