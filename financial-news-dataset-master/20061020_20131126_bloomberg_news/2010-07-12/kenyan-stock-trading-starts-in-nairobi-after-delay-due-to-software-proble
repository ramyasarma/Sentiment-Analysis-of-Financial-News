             Trading on the Nairobi Stock
Exchange began more than an hour late after a software problem
with the automated bidding system prevented users from logging
in, Information Technology Manager David Waggema said.  
 Trading started at 10:50 a.m. local time, compared to its
usual 9:30 a.m. commencement, after the technical glitch was
fixed, said Waggema by phone from Kenya’s capital Nairobi today.
