             Brazil’s real fell for the first
time in four days as China’s money supply grew the least since
December 2008, raising speculation a slowdown in its economy
will cut demand for the South American nation’s exports.  
 The real lost 0.3 percent to 1.7599 per dollar at 9:17 a.m.
New York time, from 1.7554 on July 9.  
 “If you expect China to slow down more rapidly than what
has already been priced in, then it’ll slow economic growth in
Brazil as well,” said  Ram Bala Chandran , a Latin America
currency and rates analyst at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “Most
of the export growth in Brazil has been towards China, and if
that slows, it’ll negatively impact Brazil’s trade balance and
that will negatively affect the currency.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January was unchanged at 11.32 percent.
