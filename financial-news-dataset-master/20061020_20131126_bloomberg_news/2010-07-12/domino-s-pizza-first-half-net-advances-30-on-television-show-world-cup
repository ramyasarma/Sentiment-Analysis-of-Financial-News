             Domino’s Pizza U.K. & Ireland Plc, 
the U.K.’s biggest pizza-delivery company, said first-half
profit rose 30 percent, helped by World Cup soccer matches and
sponsorship of the “Britain’s Got Talent” television show.  
 Net income increased to 12.06 million pounds ($18 million),
or 7.62 pence per share, in the six months ended June 27, from
9.3 million pounds, or 5.93 pence per share, in the year-earlier
period, the Milton Keynes, England-based company said today in a
statement on the Regulatory News Service.  
 Domino’s was helped as customers watched World Cup matches
at home on television, plus a “Two for Tuesday” advertising
campaign that started last August. Second-quarter gains in sales
at stores open at least a year of 17 percent were
“spectacular,” said  Paul Hickman , a KBC Peel Hunt analyst.  
 “Three factors contributed to this overperformance,”
wrote Hickman, who has a “buy” recommendation on the shares.
“The continued success of the ‘Two for Tuesday’ promotion, the
third year of sponsorship of ‘Britain’s Got Talent,’ and the
World Cup.”  
 Domino’s rose 3 pence to 406 pence at 9:06 a.m. in London.
The shares have increased 36 percent so far this year, giving
the company a market value of 653 million pounds.  
 Same-store sales will slow in the second half due to
comparisons with last year’s Tuesday promotions, Chief Financial
Officer  Lee Ginsberg  said in a telephone interview.  
 He said analysts are “penciling in” second-half increases
of 4 percent, and “I’m hopeful we can beat that.”  
 In August, Domino’s will start advertising its lunch menus,
plus new oven-baked submarine sandwiches, he said.  
 In February, Domino’s boosted its store-opening plans to 55
a year from 50, as it seeks to have 1,200 outlets by 2021. In
May, it opened a supply depot in Milton Keynes that it says will
save 1 million pounds a year in costs.  
 Internet sales increased 61 percent in the half, to 56.9
million pounds, the company said.
