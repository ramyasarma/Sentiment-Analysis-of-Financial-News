             Buck Showalter is close to
completing a contract to become manager for the Baltimore
Orioles, FoxSports.com reports.   
 Showalter, 54, will probably join the Orioles after the
All-Star break as Major League Baseball discourages teams from
making major announcements during its showcase events, FoxSports
said, citing unidentified major-league sources.   
 Showalter had an 882-833 record as manager of the New York
Yankees, Arizona Diamondbacks and Texas Rangers from 1992-2006.
He’s been working as a major-league analyst for Walt Disney
Co.’s ESPN network.   
 The Orioles fired Dave Trembley on June 4 and replaced him
on an interim basis with third-base coach Juan Samuel. Baltimore
has the worst record in the majors at 29-59 and trails the
first-place New York Yankees by 27 games in the American League
Eastern Division.
