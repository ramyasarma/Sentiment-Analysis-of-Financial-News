             At least four groups of Chinese
investors are considering acquiring American International Group
Inc.’s Asia insurance unit, AIA Group Ltd., the South China
Morning Post reported, citing people in the banking industry
familiar with the situation.  
 One of the groups is led by Shan Weijian, chairman of the
Pacific Alliance Group Ltd., and another by Zhang Songqiao, of
Hong Kong-based CC Land Holdings Ltd., the report said.  
 The acquisition talks are unconfirmed speculation, Shan
said, according to the report. He declined to comment further,
the Morning Post said.  
 Guo Guangchang, chairman of Shanghai-based Fosun
International Ltd., is heading a third group that is interested
in AIA assets, the Morning Post said.  
 Fosun was interested in AIA and for various reasons is not
following up the deal for now, a company spokesman was quoted by
the Post as saying.  
 The other group that has approached AIG comprises Hong Kong
and Taiwan investors, the report said, without providing further
details.
