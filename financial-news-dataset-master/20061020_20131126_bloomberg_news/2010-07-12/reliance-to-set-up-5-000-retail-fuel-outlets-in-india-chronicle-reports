             Reliance Industries Ltd.  plans to
open 5,000 retail fuel outlets in India, the Financial Chronicle
 reported , citing an unidentified company official.  
 Reliance will first open 750 stations that were shut in
2008 because it couldn’t compete with subsidized fuel prices of
state-owned companies, according to the report.  
 Reliance will eventually increase the number of outlets
after diesel prices in India are freed, the newspaper said.
