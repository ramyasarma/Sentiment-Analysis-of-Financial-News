             California’s economic growth  reached
its highest level this year in May, a sign that the most
populous U.S. state is rebounding from the recession, Comerica
Inc. said.  
 An index that measures manufacturing, tourism, travel,
trade, job growth and consumer spending rose 1 point in May to
103, the  Dallas-based lender  said today in a report. The gauge,
which held at 102 for the first four months of the year, is 7
points higher than in May 2009, Comerica said.  
 “Over the course of the year, California, like the rest of
the nation, should see continued job growth to spur a
sustainable private-sector recovery,” said  Dana Johnson ,
Comerica’s chief economist, in a statement.  
 California  had a $1.8 trillion economy in 2008, according
to the U.S. Commerce Department, which would rank it behind
Italy as the eighth-largest in the world. Its unemployment rate
stood at 12.4 percent in May, the third-highest after Michigan
and Nevada, while the national average was 9.7 percent.  
 The recession that followed the Wall Street credit crisis
in 2008 left California with a resurgent budget deficit that is
expected to reach $19.1 billion in the fiscal year that began
July 1.  
 Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  has proposed $12 billion of
spending reductions, including the elimination of entire welfare
programs, to fill gap and has said he will block any attempts to
raise taxes to make up the funding shortfall.
