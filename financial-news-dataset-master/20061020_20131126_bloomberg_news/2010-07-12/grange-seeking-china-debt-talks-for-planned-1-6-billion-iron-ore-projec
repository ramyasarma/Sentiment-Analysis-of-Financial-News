             Grange Resources Ltd. , Australia’s
largest iron-ore pellet producer, is seeking debt funding from
China to help finance a A$1.8 billion ($1.6 billion) mine in
Western Australia.  
 “We will be talking to financiers in China in the not too
distant future to shore up the debt finance that we need for
that,”  Russell Clark , chief executive officer of Perth-based
Grange, said today in a phone interview. “I’m hoping to get it
largely in place in the next six months.”  
 Grange’s  largest shareholder  Jiangsu Shagang Group Co.,
China’s biggest closely held steelmaker, will arrange debt for
as much as 70 percent of the cost of the proposed Southdown
mine, he said. Iron ore prices may be 5 percent higher next year
than this year because of supply constraints, Goldman Sachs
JBWere Pty said in a report last week.  
 “The fundamentals of growth in China and India remain, the
fundamentals of supply constraints remain,” Clark said. Grange
is studying an increase in the proposed annual capacity of
Southdown to 10 million metric tons of iron ore concentrate a
year, from the initial target of 6.6 million tons, he said. The
mine, a joint venture with Japan’s Sojitz Corp., may start
output toward the end of 2013, he said.  
 Grange gained 5.1 percent to 52 cents at the 4:10 p.m.
Sydney time close on the Australian stock exchange, giving it a
market valuation of A$599 million. Grange also produces iron ore
pellets from the Savage River mine in Australia’s Tasmania
state.
