             The Czech Republic will have very
few opportunities for selling stakes in state-owned companies in
the near future, given the current state of the financial
markets,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing incoming Industry
and Trade Minister Martin Kocourek.  
 The two most likely state-owned properties to be privatized
in the long term are the forests and the postal service, the
newspaper said, citing an interview with Kocourek. The proceeds
will be invested in the pension reform rather than used to
reduce the budget deficit, according to the report.
