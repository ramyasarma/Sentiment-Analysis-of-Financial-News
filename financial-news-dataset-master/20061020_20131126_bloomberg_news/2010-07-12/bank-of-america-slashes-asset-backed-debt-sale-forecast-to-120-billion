             Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut
its 2010 forecast for asset-backed debt sales tied to consumer
lending to $120 billion from $150 billion as U.S. households
borrow less and banks rely on deposits to fund loans.  
 The reduced volume is primarily because of a drop in
issuance of bonds tied to credit-card payments, the analysts
said in a July 8 report. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based
lender slashed its forecast of the debt to $25.5 billion from
$50 billion. Sales of card-backed bonds stand at $5.6 billion,
compared with $24.9 billion during the similar period in 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “Volume has been and will likely continue to be affected
by tighter underwriting standards and constrained consumer
spending,” said the New York-based analysts led by  Chris Flanagan  and  Theresa O’Neill .  
 Additionally, banks are relying on  deposits  to fund new
loans, keeping sales of bonds tied to credit-card payments low,
according to the report.  
 Top-rated securities backed by credit-card payments and
maturing in about two years yield 24 basis points more than
benchmark swap rates, unchanged from the previous week,
according to the report. Similar debt tied to auto loans yields
20 basis points over the benchmark, also unchanged.  
 The analysts maintained their 2010 forecast of $60 billion
for bonds backed by auto debt. There have been $33.9 billion in
sales to date, according to Bank of America.  
 Toyota Motor Corp., through its finance arm, is marketing
$1.25 billion in bonds backed by auto debt that may be sold as
soon as this week.  
 While June auto sales were up more than 14 percent,
compared with a year earlier, restrained incentives and tight
inventory may be hindering sales, the analysts said. Inventory
of cars is 1 percent below the five-year average, and light
truck supplies are 15 percent below the five-year average,
according to the report.  
 Factors such as the need to replace old cars and improved
financing should spur a slow improvement in 2010 and 2011 sales,
the analysts said.
