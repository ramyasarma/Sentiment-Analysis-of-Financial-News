             The pound rose against the euro as
European stocks advanced, boosting demand for assets correlated
with economic growth, and speculation mounted about a takeover
bid for BP Plc.  
 Sterling snapped a two-day drop against the single currency
after data showed the U.K. economy grew 0.3 percent in the first
quarter, matching the median estimate of 29 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  BP  shares jumped 9.4 percent after the Sunday
Times said Exxon Mobil Corp. has been told by the U.S.
government that it can look at a bid for the U.K. oil producer.
Sterling resumed its descent against the dollar after Standard &
Poor’s maintained its negative outlook on the U.K.  
 “There’s a slight return to the pro-risk trade,” said
 Neil Jones , head of European hedge fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “If this risk-on continues
through the earnings season, I would imagine the pound does
quite well.” Speculation about a bid for BP, the third-largest
stock by market value in the British benchmark index, may also
be boosting the currency, he said.  
 The pound rose as much as 0.6 percent against the euro, the
most since June 29, to 83.41 pence and traded 0.2 percent higher
at 83.73 pence as of 5:18 p.m. in London. The FTSE 100 Index of
shares rose a fifth day, gaining 0.7 percent.  
 Sterling dipped against the dollar after S&P said there is
“still a material risk that the U.K.’s net general government-
debt burden may approach a level incompatible with the nation’s
AAA long-term credit rating.” The pound was down 0.3 percent to
$1.5020.  
 Gilt Yields  
 The 10-year gilt yield stayed near the lowest in more than
14 months as the Office for National Statistics said Britain’s
current-account deficit was 9.6 billion pounds ($14.4 billion)
in the first three months of this year, the widest since the
third quarter of 2007. Reports later this week may show
inflation is slowing and a drop in unemployment is losing pace.  
 The 10-year gilt yield was little changed at 3.34 percent.
It reached 3.31 percent on July 1, the lowest since April 2009.  
 The Bank of England said in a report today that U.K. bond
yields were reduced about 100 basis points as a result of its
200 billion-pound bond-purchase plan.  
 The U.K. 10-year breakeven rate, the difference between the
yield on 10-year gilts and equivalent-maturity inflation-linked
bonds, fell 2 basis points to 273 basis points, the lowest level
since Feb. 12. The government said last week it plans to align
future increases in pensions to the CPI measure of inflation
rather than the retail-price index, which tends to be higher.  
 In the short term, “high uncertainty may lead to a
softening of breakevens as liability-driven investment programs
are put on review,”  Giles Gale , a fixed-income strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London, said in a research
report dated July 9.  
 Inflation-Debt Sale  
 Britain will sell 1.2 billion pounds of inflation-linked
bonds due in 2022 on July 15. It will auction 2.25 billion
pounds of 2046 bonds on July 14.  
 A report tomorrow will probably show U.K. consumer-price
inflation slowed to an annual 3.1 percent in June from 3.4
percent the previous month, according to economists’ estimates
in a Bloomberg survey. Data on July 14 will show jobless claims
fell 20,000 in June, after a 30,900 drop in May, a separate
survey predicts.
