             Brazil’s Finance Ministry may raise
its forecast for gross domestic product growth this year to
about 7 percent from 6.5 percent, Folha de S. Paulo reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 The central bank is forecasting 7.3 percent economic growth
this year, the newspaper said. The finance ministry wants the
central bank to increase the benchmark interest rate at its
meeting next month and doesn’t see the need to raise the rate
above 12 percent, Folha said.  
 Policy makers raised the so-called Selic rate to 10.25
percent from 9.50 percent at their last meeting in June.
