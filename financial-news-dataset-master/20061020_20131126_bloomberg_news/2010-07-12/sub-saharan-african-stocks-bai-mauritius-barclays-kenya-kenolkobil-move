 Kenya’s  All-Share Index  gained for a third day, increasing

24,632.78 at the close in Lagos,  Sola Oni , spokesman for the
Nigerian bourse, said. Namibia’s  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index  fell

 Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd.  (BCBL KN), Kenya’s biggest
lender by market value, rose the most in three days, gaining 1
shillings, or 1.6 percent, to 64 shillings, after Kestrel
Capital (East Africa) Ltd. forecast that the lender may pay a
special dividend.  
 British American Investment Co.  (BAIN MP), a Mauritian
investment-holding company, rallied 3 Mauritian rupees, or 15
percent, to 20 rupees, the highest since at least 2003. The
Stock Exchange lifted a suspension on the shares today and more
than 90 percent of those holding shares subject to an offer by
Seaton Ltd. gave their approval for the deal, the company said
in a statement to the exchange on July 9.  
 Intercontinental Bank Plc  (INTERCON NL), a Nigerian lender
bailed out by the country’s central bank last year, rose for the
first day in three, climbing 7 kobo, or 4.7 percent, to 1.57
naira. The bank expects to see an improvement in first-half
results after it reported a decline in profit for the first
three months, Reuters reported after the market closed on July
9, citing Chief Executive Officer  Mahmoud Lai Alabi .  
 KenolKobil Ltd.  (KNOC KN), a Kenyan fuel retailer with
operations in seven African nations, advanced 10 cents, or 0.9
percent, to 10.75 shillings, the highest since May 21.
KenolKobil expects first-half profit to be “considerably”
better than a year ago, boosted by stronger non-fuel revenue at
its service stations, Managing Director  Jacob Segman  said in a
statement to the Nairobi Stock Exchange on July 9.
