             Crude oil dropped for the first time
in four days as the dollar strengthened against the euro,
curbing the appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.  
 Oil fell 1.5 percent as the dollar advanced amid
speculation that tests to demonstrate the resilience of Europe’s
banking system will fail to assure investors that the region is
recovering from its sovereign-debt crisis. Oil extended losses
after breaking technical support at $75.40.  
 “The crude market seems to be driven by the currencies and
the equities market rather than the fundamentals,” said  Kyle Cooper , managing director at energy consultant IAF Advisors in
Houston.  
 Crude oil dropped $1.14 to settle at $74.95 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have fallen 5.6 percent
this year. Oil gained 5.5 percent last week, the biggest rally
in six weeks, as declining U.S. stockpiles and a drop in jobless
claims bolstered speculation the country would sustain its
economic recovery.  
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2593 as of 3:09 p.m. in New
York from $1.2641 on July 9, when it touched $1.2722, the
highest level since May 12.  
 Oil prices broke through technical support at $75.40 and
then at $75 and may test $74.50, said  Carl Larry , president of
Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  
 “People are still playing the equity market and the
strength of the recovery, and we’re stuck,” Larry said. “It’s
a battle sideways here.”  
 Crude futures on the Nymex have traded between $70 and $80
a barrel since June 8. Prices settled at $76.09 a barrel on July
9, the highest level since June 28.  
 Equities Decline  
 “The wind has come out of the market’s sails,” said
 Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Bache Commodities Ltd.
“Last week we got to the top of the recent trading range but
failed to break through it, so without a boost from the equity
market, oil is likely to sag a bit more.”  
 U.S. stocks fluctuated a day after the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index completed its biggest weekly gain in a year as
commodity producers retreated and technology companies rose. The
 S&P 500  gained 0.1 percent on the day, and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  added 0.2 percent.  
 U.S. oil supplies were at the highest level in 20 years for
the first week in July, according to an Energy Department report
last week.  
 Oil, Gasoline Inventories  
 Inventories probably fell 1.5 million barrels last week
from 358.2 million barrels in the prior week, according to the
median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
before a government report July 14. In the week ended July 2,
stockpiles dropped the most since Dec. 18 as Hurricane Alex shut
in domestic production and imports.  
 Gasoline supplies  rose  700,000 barrels  from 219.4 million
barrels the week before, a third consecutive gain, the survey
showed. Gasoline for August delivery fell 4.2 cents, or 2
percent, to settle at $2.028 a gallon on the Nymex.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reduced
their net-long position in New York oil futures for a second
week, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed.  
 Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 50,503 contracts in the week
ended July 6, compared with 73,300 the prior week, the
Washington-based commission said July 9 in its Commitments of
Traders report.  
 China, the world’s second-largest energy consumer after the
U.S., reported record oil imports in June.  
 China imported 22.14 million metric tons, beating the
previous record of 20.98 million in April, according to
preliminary data from the General Administration of Customs on
July 10. Imports surged 30 percent in the first half of this
year. The country paid an average of $77.20 a barrel for crude
in June, compared with $82.50 in May.  
 Chinese Imports  
 “The record imports of oil definitely look bullish because
the last two or three months people have gotten concerned about
oil demand because the economy had weakened,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in
Winchester, Massachusetts.  
 Oil may push toward $84 a barrel based on signals from on a
Japanese charting method called Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, or “one-
glance cloud chart,” according to Astmax Ltd.  
 Oil’s July 9 close of $76.09 a barrel breached the upper
edge of the Kumo, or cloud, formation between $75.70 and $73.57
on a daily chart, a sign that prices will rise, said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity-fund manager at Astmax in Tokyo. Prices may
be limited by the top of $80.21 on the weekly Ichimoku graph.  
 Brent crude for August settlement fell $1.05, or 1.4
percent, to $74.37 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 457,175
contracts as of 2:34 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 515,760
contracts July 9, 33 percent below the average of the past three
months. Open interest was 1.28 million contracts, the highest
level since June 18.
