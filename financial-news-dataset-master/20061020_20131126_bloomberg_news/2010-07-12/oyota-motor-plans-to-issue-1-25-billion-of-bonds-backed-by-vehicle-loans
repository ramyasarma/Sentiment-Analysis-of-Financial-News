             Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s
biggest carmaker, plans to sell through its finance arm $1.25
billion of bonds backed by auto loans, according to a person
familiar with the offering.  
 The issue may be sold as soon as this week, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the terms aren’t
public.  SLM Corp. , the student lender known as Sallie Mae, is
marketing $869 million of bonds backed by private loans that
will also be sold this week.  
 Sales of asset-backed securities tied to vehicles represent
almost $34 billion of the $55 billion in bonds linked to
consumer and business lending this year, according to Bank of
America Corp. data. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank
forecasts issuance of $60 billion of bonds tied to autos this
year, according to a July 9 report.  
 While June auto deliveries rose 14 percent from a year
earlier, restrained incentives and tight inventory may be
hindering sales, New York-based analysts led by  Chris Flanagan 
and  Theresa O’Neill  wrote in the report.  
 Inventory of cars is 1 percent below the five-year average,
and light-truck supplies are 15 percent below the five-year
average, according to the report.  
 Factors such as the need to replace old cars and improved
financing should spur a slow increase in 2010 and 2011 sales,
the analysts said.  
 Top-rated securities backed by auto loans yield about 68
basis points more than Treasuries, compared with 79 basis points
on Jan. 4, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data.
