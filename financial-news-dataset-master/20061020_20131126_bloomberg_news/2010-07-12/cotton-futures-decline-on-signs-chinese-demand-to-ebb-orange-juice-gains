             Cotton futures fell the most in a
week on signs that demand in China, the world’s biggest user,
will wane as mills reduce yarn production. Orange-juice prices
rebounded.  
 Yarn inventories in  China  are increasing, said  Andy Ryan , a
risk-management consultant at broker FCStone Group Inc. Cotton
prices have dropped 15 percent from a two-year high of 87.1
cents a pound on April 26.  
 “There are signs that downstream demand is weakening in
China,” Ryan said from Nashville, Tennessee. “Our sister firm
in China speaks to Chinese mills, and they have stockpiles of
yarn, whereas just a few months ago, they didn’t have any
inventory.”  
 Cotton for December delivery dropped 1.2 cents, or 1.6
percent, to 73.79 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
the biggest decline since July 6, when the price also fell 1.6
percent.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 1.55
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $1.391 a pound in New York, the first
gain in five sessions. Earlier, the price touched $1.3625, the
lowest level for a most-active contract since June 8.  
 “There was support for a technical bottom,” said  Sterling Smith , an analyst at Country Hedging Inc. in St. Paul,
Minnesota. “When there’s no big news to really push the market,
then it becomes very technical.”  
 The beverage has gained 46 percent in the past year on
speculation that supplies will trail demand.
