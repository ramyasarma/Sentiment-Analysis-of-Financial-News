             Toronto-Dominion Bank  is planning to
hire about 12 people to create a precious metals trading group
that can handle gold, silver, platinum and palladium, the Globe
and Mail reported.  
 Tim Gardiner , who ran Mitsui & Co.’s precious metals
business, will lead the group, the newspaper said today, citing
 Patrick Meneley , head of investment banking at TD Securities.  
 Toronto-Dominion wants to take advantage of Canada’s
position as home to many of the world’s publicly traded metals
companies and as prices rise, the Globe said.
