             Three British men convicted of
plotting to become suicide bombers were sentenced to life in
prison, London police said in an e-mailed statement.  
 Ibrahim Savant ,  Arafat Waheed Khan  and  Waheed Zaman  were
sentenced at a hearing at Woolwich Crown Court today. The men
were convicted by a jury last week of conspiring with other
terrorists already found guilty of plotting to blow up passenger
jets during trans-Atlantic flights.  
 The men were arrested in August 2006 as part of an
investigation into a conspiracy to take bombs, disguised as soft
drinks cartons, onto planes departing London’s Heathrow airport
for destinations in the U.S. and Canada, prosecutors said.  
 The investigation prompted limits on the amount of liquids
and gels passengers were allowed to carry onto planes. It caused
temporary chaos at airports, with more than 2,380 flights from
London canceled in the week following the arrests.
