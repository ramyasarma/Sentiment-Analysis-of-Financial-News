             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on adverse U.S. weather and
signs of increasing export demand, said  Chad Henderson , a market
analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
Wisconsin.  
 -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower on
speculation that rising global supplies will outpace demand,
Henderson said. Soybean-meal futures may open steady to $1 lower
per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to fall 0.1 cent
to 0.2 cent a pound, he said.  
 -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange after a government report on July 9 showed
shrinking global production, spurring speculators to unwind bets
on lower prices, Henderson said.
