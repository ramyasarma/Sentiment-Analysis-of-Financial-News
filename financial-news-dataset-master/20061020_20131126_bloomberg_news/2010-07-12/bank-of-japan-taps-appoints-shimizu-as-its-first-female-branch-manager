             The Bank of Japan appointed  Tokiko Shimizu  as its first female branch manager in its 128-year
history.  
 Shimizu, 45, will assume the post in Takamatsu, western
Japan, on July 16, according to a statement released by the
central bank in Tokyo today. Former central bank chief  Toshihiko Fukui  and current Deputy Governor  Hirohide Yamaguchi  are among
executives that have held the post, which is the bank’s main
office in the Shikoku region.  
 The central bank’s nine-member policy board is dominated by
men, with  Miyako Suda  the sole woman and only the second to hold
the post since the bank was established in 1882. That contrasts
with the situation at the U.S. Federal Reserve, which will have
three women on its seven-member panel if San Francisco Fed
President  Janet Yellen ’s nomination as the vice chairman is
confirmed by the Senate.  
 In 2008, women accounted for only 2 percent of all
management posts at central government ministries and agencies
in Japan, according to government data.  
 Shimizu joined the central bank in 1987 after graduating
from Tokyo University with an engineering degree and has served
at the bank’s financial market department and London office.
