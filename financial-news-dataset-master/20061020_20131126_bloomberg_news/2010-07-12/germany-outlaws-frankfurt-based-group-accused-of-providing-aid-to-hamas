             The German government banned a
Frankfurt-based organization it accused of providing indirect
financial aid to the Islamic militant group Hamas.  
 The International Humanitarian Development Organization, or
IHH, was accused of “consciously and purposefully” supporting
groups that directly support or are close to Hamas, the  Interior
Ministry said  today.  
 “Under the cover issue of humanitarian aid, the IHH has
for a long period of time and with considerable financial
assistance supported so-called social organizations based in the
Gaza Strip that are close to Hamas,” Interior Minister  Thomas de Maiziere  said in the statement from Berlin. Details of the
ban conditions weren’t provided.  
 Hamas, which seized full control in Gaza in 2007 after
winning Palestinian parliamentary elections the previous year,
is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S., the European
Union and Israel.
