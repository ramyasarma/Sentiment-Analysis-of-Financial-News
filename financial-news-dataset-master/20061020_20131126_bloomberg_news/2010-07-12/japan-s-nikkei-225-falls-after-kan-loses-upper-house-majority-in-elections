             Japan’s  stocks  fell for the first
time in three days, led by banks amid political uncertainty
after the ruling party lost control of the upper house in
elections yesterday.  
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest bank
by market value, dropped 2.1 percent. Ryohin Keikaku Co.,
operator of the Mujirushi Ryohin retail chain, declined 4.4
percent after posting profit declines. Gree Inc. sank 1.1
percent after Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. cut
its rating on the social-networking site operator.  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.4 percent to 9,548.11
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index dropped
0.4 percent to 857.70, with almost twice as many stocks
retreating as advancing. Both gauges gained at least 0.5 percent
earlier.  
 “The results of yesterday’s election revealed instability
in Japanese politics,” said  Masatsugu Okeya , a fund manager at
Chiba-Gin Asset Management Co. “It’s likely investors are
shifting funds to stocks that are dependent on overseas revenue
from domestic stocks.”  
 The Nikkei 225 rose 4.1 percent last week, the biggest
weekly gain this year, as U.S. retail sales rose and the
International Monetary Fund increased its forecast for global
economic growth. Companies in the gauge trade at 17.8 times
estimated earnings, compared with 13.2 times for the U.S.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Stocks in the U.S. gauge climbed
0.7 percent on July 9, its fourth straight day of gains.

                          July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Martin Schulz, senior economist at Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo, talks with Bloomberg's Linzie Janis about Japan's politics and implications for the economy.
     Japan’s Prime Minister Naoto Kan lost control of parliament’s upper house, undermining legislative efforts to cut the world’s largest public debt and creating the possibility of a third leadership change in a year. The ruling Democratic Party of Japan won 44 seats, compared with 51 for the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, according to results compiled by public broadcaster NHK.
