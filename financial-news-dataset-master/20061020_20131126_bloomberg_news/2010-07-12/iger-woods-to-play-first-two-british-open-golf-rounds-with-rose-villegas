             Tiger Woods  will be paired with
 Justin Rose  of England and  Camilo Villegas  of Colombia for the
first two rounds of the British Open.  
 Woods will be seeking his third straight victory on the Old
Course at St. Andrews after winning the Open in 2000 and 2005.
He’ll start the July 15 first round at 9:09 a.m. local time and
will tee off at 2:20 p.m. the next day.  
 Woods, No. 1 in the Official Golf Ranking, failed to shoot
below par in any round in his last start at the AT&T National
earlier this month. He finished tied for fourth at both the
Masters and U.S. Open, the year’s first two majors.  
 Rose has won two of his past three starts on the U.S. PGA
Tour, including the AT&T National. He failed to qualify for the
Masters and U.S. Open.  
 Defending champion  Stewart Cink , who beat  Tom Watson  in a
playoff last year at Turnberry, will be paired with 2002 British
Open winner  Ernie Els  and England’s  Ian Poulter .  
 World No. 2  Phil Mickelson , who won his third Masters title
in April, will play with two-time U.S. Open winner  Retief Goosen 
and European Ryder Cup captain  Colin Montgomerie .
