             The number of  capesize  ships waiting
to load or unload cargo globally decreased 5.2 percent in the
week to July 9, according to a company that tracks port delays.  
 There were 146 of the vessels anchored, down from 154 a
week earlier, Truro, England-based  Global Ports  said in an e-
mailed report sent on July 10. The number of ships at anchor
increased to 38 from 34 in Brazil and were unchanged at 35 in
China. The total number of vessels waiting in Australia shrank
to 152 from 157, including smaller classes.  
 Capesizes typically haul iron ore and coal, the two biggest
dry-bulk commodities carried at sea.
