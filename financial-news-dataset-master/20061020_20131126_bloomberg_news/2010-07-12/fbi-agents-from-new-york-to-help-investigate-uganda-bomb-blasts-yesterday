             The Federal Bureau of Investigation
will send agents from New York to aid in the investigation of
two bomb attacks yesterday in Uganda in which at least 74 people
died, an FBI spokesman said.  
 The blasts occurred at separate venues yesterday in the
Ugandan capital, Kampala, where crowds had gathered to watch the
soccer World Cup final. The first explosion went off at the
Ethiopian Village Restaurant in the south of the city, while a
second followed at the Kyadondo Rugby Club in eastern Kampala
about 50 minutes later, said Fred Opolot, director of the Uganda
Media Center.  
 “The New York Joint Terrorism Task Force is in the process
of deploying a team of agents and forensic experts to assist
Ugandan authorities in their investigation,” FBI spokesman
 James Margolin  said in an interview.  
 This isn’t the first time agents with the Joint Terrorism
Task Force in New York have been dispatched overseas to aid in
terrorism investigations. Teams of FBI agents were sent to East
Africa in August 1998 to investigate the near-simultaneous
bombings of U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and
Nairobi, Kenya, that claimed the lives of 224 people, including
12 Americans, and injured more than 5,000.  
 The U.S. said that  Osama bin Laden  was behind that attack,
and four of his followers were convicted in 2001 of federal
charges stemming from the bombings.
