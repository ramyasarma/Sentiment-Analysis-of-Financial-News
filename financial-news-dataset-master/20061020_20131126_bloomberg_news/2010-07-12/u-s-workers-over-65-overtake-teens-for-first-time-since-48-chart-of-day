             U.S. employees old enough to retire
are outnumbering their teenage counterparts for the first time
since at least 1948, when  Harry Truman  was president, a sign of
how generations are competing for scarce jobs.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY shows the number of people aged 65 and
older in the labor force -- defined as those who are working or
looking for work -- has averaged 6.6 million in the first half
of this year, more than the 5.9 million workers between 16 and
19, according to the Labor Department. There are now 1.13 older
workers for every teen, compared with 0.5 a decade ago. (For the

 Even after a year of economic growth, companies are
reluctant to hire as the housing market weakens and
manufacturing growth shows signs of slowing. The Labor
Department said last week that private U.S. companies added
83,000 positions, fewer than economists had forecast. The
average workweek and hourly earnings fell.  
 “Older workers need to replenish their 401-k plans, so
those who have jobs are clinging to them rather than retiring,”
 Alicia Munnell , director of the Center for Retirement Research
at Boston College, said in a telephone interview. Teenagers lose
out because less-educated workers and those with shorter tenure
are most vulnerable during a recession, she said.  
 The participation rate among those 65 and older has
averaged 17.4 percent so far this year before seasonal
adjustment, compared with an average 12.9 percent in 2000.
Meanwhile, the rate among teenagers has shrunk to an average
34.5 percent, from 52 percent a decade ago.  
 Older workers are competing for some jobs with teens, a May
2010 report by Labor Department economist Teresa Morisi
indicates. In food preparation and serving, the top category for
teens, employment fell by 242,000 among 16-to-19 year-olds while
rising by 128,000 among those 55 and older in the years from
2000 to 2009, the report shows.
