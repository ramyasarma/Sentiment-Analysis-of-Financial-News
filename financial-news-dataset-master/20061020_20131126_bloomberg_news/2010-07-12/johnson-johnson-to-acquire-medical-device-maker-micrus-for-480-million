             Johnson & Johnson  plans to acquire
Micrus Endovascular Corp. for $23.40 a share, a transaction
estimated at $480 million, to add products to treat strokes.  
 Micrus  will join the drugmaker’s neurology device business,
New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson said in a
statement today.  
 Stroke is the third-leading cause of death in the U.S.,
according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. An estimated 6.5 million people, or 2.9 percent
of American adults, have had a stroke, according to the CDC.
Micrus makes products such as microcoils that are used to treat
aneurysms, a cause of stroke, as well as guide wires and
catheters for placing the devices.  
 Johnson & Johnson fell 33 cents to $60.21 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. San Jose, California-
based Micrus rose $1, or 4.5 percent, to $23.19 in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading.  
 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom are representing
Micrus in the acquisition.
