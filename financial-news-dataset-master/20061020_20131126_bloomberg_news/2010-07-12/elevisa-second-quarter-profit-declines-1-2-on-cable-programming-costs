             Grupo Televisa SA , the world’s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said second-quarter net
income fell 1.2 percent as cable programming costs increased.  
 Net income dropped to 1.8 billion pesos ($140.9 million)
from 1.83 billion pesos a year earlier, the Mexico City-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Sales climbed 14
percent to 14.4 billion pesos helped partly by programs around
the World Cup soccer games and advertising revenue.  
 Televisa introduced a pay sports channel called Televisa
Deportes Network in 2009 and added the cable news network Foro
TV this year to increase its production capabilities and boost
outlets for advertisers. Operating profit in the pay television
unit dropped 21 percent to 365 million pesos.  
 Financing costs jumped 39 percent to 1.15 billion pesos on
higher interest expenses and a larger foreign-exchange loss,
Televisa said.  
 The Sky satellite TV unit added 251,000 customers for a
total of 2.45 million in the quarter. The company has been
paying for the right to broadcast the World Cup games on its Sky
Mexico satellite network.  
 Televisa rose 40 centavos to 48.23 pesos July 9 in Mexico
City trading. The shares have dropped 11 percent this year.
