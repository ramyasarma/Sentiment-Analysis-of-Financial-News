             An Indian rocket placed five
satellites in orbit, including one remote sensing device that
will help in urban planning and rural infrastructure development,
the country’s space agency said on its website.  
 The rocket, known as the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle,
lifted off at 9.22 a.m. local time today from the Sriharikota
space station in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, the
 Indian Space Research Organization  said.  
 The payloads included the Indian remote-sensing Cartosat-2B
 satellite , with a 0.8-meter resolution panchromatic camera on
board, and smaller probes developed by scientists in Algeria,
Canada and Switzerland.  
 India’s ambition to expand its satellite-launch program
received a setback in April when a rocket powered by the
country’s first indigenously developed cryogenic engines,
capable of lifting heavier payloads into space, failed shortly
after takeoff.
