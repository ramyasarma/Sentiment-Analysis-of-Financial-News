             Western Australian grain production
may be 9 million to 10 million metric tons this year, Colin
Tutt, general manager operations at Perth-based CBH Group said,
following rainfall across cropping regions since late last week.  
 Wheat production in the state may be around 7 million to
7.3 million tons, he estimated. The growing season this year was
about six weeks behind normal, he said today by phone.
