             Iran is coming closer to reaching
the capability to make nuclear weapons, Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  said, calling for a speedy resumption of negotiations
with the government in Tehran.  
 “We have to get away from short-cut approaches to this
issue,” Medvedev said in a meeting with ambassadors in Moscow
today. “It’s obvious that Iran is moving closer to possessing a
capability that could in principle be used to build nuclear
weapons.”  
 Medvedev said sanctions against Iran are meant to send a
signal to the country’s leadership and stimulate talks. “We
need patience and the swift resumption of the negotiating
process,” he said. “If diplomacy lets this chance slip away
now, it will be our collective failure.”  
 The Russian leader renewed his call for Iran to cooperate
with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
