             Wheat rallied, erasing earlier
losses, on speculation that dry weather in Russia, the world’s
fourth-biggest exporter, will limit global supply.  
 Russia’s worst drought in a decade has damaged more than
half the grain planted in 11 regions, and dry weather may
persist for the rest of July, said Anna Strashnaya, head of
agro-meteorological forecasts at the Federal Hydrometeorological
Service. The U.S. is the biggest exporter, followed by Canada
and Australia, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  
 The Russian drought “is the most bullish side of the wheat
market right now,” said  Darrell Holaday , the president of
Advanced Market Concepts in Manhattan, Kansas. “Maybe that puts
a bottom in the market. The question is how much more upside can
you get out of this?”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 0.75 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $5.3875 a bushel at 12:13 p.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Before today, wheat jumped 26 percent in the past
month, partly on signs that global output won’t keep pace with
demand.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
