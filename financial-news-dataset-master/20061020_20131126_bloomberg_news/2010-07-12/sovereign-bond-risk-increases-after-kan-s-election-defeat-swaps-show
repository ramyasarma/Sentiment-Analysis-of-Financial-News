             The cost of insuring Japanese
government debt from non-payment increased after the party of
Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  lost control of parliament’s upper
house, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts protecting the debt for five years increased 1
basis point to 89 basis points as of 9:49 a.m. in Tokyo,
according to Citigroup Inc.  
 The ruling Democratic Party of Japan won 44 seats compared
with 51 for the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, according
to results compiled by public broadcaster NHK. The result may
undermine legislative efforts to cut the world’s largest public
debt and create the possibility of a third leadership change in
a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its debt obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt, and typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates. A basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.
