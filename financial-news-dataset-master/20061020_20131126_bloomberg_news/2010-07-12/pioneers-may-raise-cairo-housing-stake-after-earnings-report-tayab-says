             Pioneers Holding , Egypt’s second-
largest publicly traded investment bank, said it may consider
adding to a stake in  Cairo Housing & Development  after the
housebuilder reports second quarter earnings.  
 Pioneers International Bahrain, of which Pioneers Holding
owns 25 percent, bought 245,000 shares of Cairo Housing
yesterday, according to a statement by the company to the
Egyptian Stock Exchange. The purchase is not part of Pioneers
Holding’s plan to increase its shareholding in the developer to
30 percent as announced in January, board member  Khaled El Tayeb 
said in a phone interview today.  
 Cairo Housing gained the most in almost seven months after
the Egyptian Exchange disclosed the purchase by Pioneers
International Bahrain. Cairo Housing added 5.9 percent, its
biggest gain since Dec. 14, to 5.07 Egyptian pounds at the close
in Cairo. Pioneers lost 0.6 percent to 3.32 pounds.  
 Cairo Housing posted a 21 percent increase in first quarter
profit to 9.6 million Egyptian pounds ($1.7 million) compared
with the same period a year earlier, according to the company’s
regulatory filing on May 16.
