             Kuwait Petroleum Corp., the state-
owned producer, kept its official oil exports to Asia for August
unchanged from July.  
 Crude supplies under long-term contracts will be sold at a
$2 a-barrel discount to the average of Persian Gulf benchmark
Oman and Dubai oils published by price reporting service Platts,
the state-owned company said in a faxed statement today.  
 Official prices were last at this level in May. This was
the steepest discount since cargoes for February 2009 loading.
Kuwait sold 86 percent of its 1.348 million barrels a day of
exports to Asia last year, according to data from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries statistical
bulletin.
