             Latecoere SA  received an ultimatum
from its banking lenders telling the aerospace-parts maker to
find partners to help it expand, La Lettre de L’Expansion
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The banks agreed to restructure  Latecoere ’s debt and
maintain letters of credit after the Toulouse, France-based
company presented a five-year business plan, the newspaper said.
