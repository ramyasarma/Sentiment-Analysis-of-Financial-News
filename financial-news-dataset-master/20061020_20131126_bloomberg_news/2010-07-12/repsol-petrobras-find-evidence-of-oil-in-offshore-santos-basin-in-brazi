             Repsol YPF SA, Spain’s biggest oil
company, and Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s state-controlled
oil producer, found evidence of oil in an offshore well in
Brazil’s Santos Basin, the Brazilian petroleum regulator said.  
 The discovery was made at well 4REPF8SPS in the S-M-673
block at a water depth of 156.5 meters (513 feet), the National
Petroleum Agency said on its website. The contract is named BM-
S-48, according to the regulator.  
 Repsol is the operator of the project with a 40 percent
stake, Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras owns 35 percent, while
Vale SA and Woodside Petroleum Ltd. each own 12.5 percent. The
companies haven’t determined if the find can be developed
commercially.
