             U.S. Highland Inc. , the maker of
Motocross performance motorcycles, plummeted in over-the-counter
trading after the company’s president and two other top officers
died in a plane crash.  
 The  shares  fell 54 cents, or 44 percent, to 75 cents at
3:45 p.m., the biggest drop since April 1.  
 President  Mats Malmberg , 41; Chief Operating Officer  Chase Bales , 51; and Chief Financial Officer  Damian Riddoch , 37, died
late July 10 when their plane smashed into a wooded area in
Tulsa, Oklahoma, killing all three on board, the company said
today in a statement.  
 “This is a human tragedy beyond imagination,” Chief
Executive Officer  Steven Moell  said in the statement. “They
were all true visionaries and will be deeply missed.”  
 The three were returning from Detroit when an emergency
landing at Tulsa’s airport was requested, U.S. Highland said.
Bales was in the pilot’s seat at the time of the crash, Darin
Long, a U.S. Highland spokesman, said in an interview.  
 The men were aboard a twin-engine Cessna 421A, said  Keith Holloway , a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman.  
 The sky was clear, and winds were calm near Tulsa around
the time of the crash, according to data from Weather
Underground Inc., which archives historical weather conditions.  
 An NTSB investigator is on the scene, and the cause of the
crash hasn’t been determined, Holloway said.  
 The company will name the executives’ replacements
tomorrow, Long said.
