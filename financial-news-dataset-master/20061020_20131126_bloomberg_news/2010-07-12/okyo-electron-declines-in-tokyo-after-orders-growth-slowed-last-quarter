             Tokyo Electron Ltd. , the world’s
second-largest maker of semiconductor equipment, fell in Tokyo
trading after its orders for chip and flat-panel manufacturing
gear rose at the slowest pace in five quarters.  
 Tokyo Electron  fell 1.1 percent to 4,860 yen as of 9:45 a.m.
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, after declining as much as 2.5
percent. The  benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average  slipped 0.1
percent.  
 Orders in the three months ended June 30 at the Tokyo-based
company rose 8.8 percent from the previous quarter to 146
billion yen ($1.6 billion), the company said in a  preliminary
statement  after markets closed on July 9. Bookings increased 21
percent in the three months ended March 31 and by 18 percent in
the period before that, according to figures on Tokyo Electron’s
website.  
 “The market was looking for better numbers,” said  Damian Thong , a Tokyo-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “The
glass-is-half-empty crowd would probably see the prospect of a
further slowdown in orders growth.”  
 Tokyo Electron’s orders have risen for five quarters since
bottoming at 26.9 billion yen in the three months ended March 31,
2009.
