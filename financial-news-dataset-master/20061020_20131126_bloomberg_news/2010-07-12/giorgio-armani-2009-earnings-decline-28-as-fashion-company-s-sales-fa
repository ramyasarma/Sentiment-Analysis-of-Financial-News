             Giorgio Armani SpA, the Italian
fashion company whose clothes are worn by celebrities including
Gemma Arterton and Ricky Martin, said profit fell 28 percent
last year because of the recession in North America and Japan.  
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell to 218 million euros, the Milan-based company
said today in an e-mailed statement. EBITDA was 303.2 million
euros in 2008, the company said. Consolidated sales in 2009
declined 6 percent to 1.52 billion euros, Armani said today. The
company didn’t disclose net income.
