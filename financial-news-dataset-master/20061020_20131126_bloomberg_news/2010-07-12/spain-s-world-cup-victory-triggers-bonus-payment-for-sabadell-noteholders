             Spain’s victory in the World Cup
soccer tournament benefited investors in equity-linked notes
issued by Banco de Sabadell SA, which pledged a bonus if the
southern European country won the competition.  
 Holders of the securities tied to the  EuroStoxx 50  stock
index will get a 7 percent bonus on half their initial
investment after Spain’s win in South Africa, according to the
issue’s prospectus.  Banco de Sabadell , the biggest commercial
bank in Spain’s Catalan region, issued as much as 75 million
euros ($94 million) of the securities in April.  
 The three-year notes, aimed at individual investors, pay a
return based on the performance of  European stocks  and guarantee
holders get their principle back. The EuroStoxx 50 index, which
tracks companies including drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis SA and
Telefonica SA, has fallen 9.7 percent this year and 10 percent
since the start of April.  
 Spain beat the Netherlands 1-0 in extra time yesterday to
win its first soccer World Cup title.
