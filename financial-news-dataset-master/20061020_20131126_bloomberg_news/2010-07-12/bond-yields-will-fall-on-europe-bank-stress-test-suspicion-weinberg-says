             Bond yields will fall this week amid
“suspicion” about bank stress tests in the euro region and as
weak economic data spurs demand for safer assets, said  Carl Weinberg , chief economist of High Frequency Economics.  
 “No one in their right mind will believe” results that
would show the strength of 91 banks to be “solid as a rock,”
Weinberg, who is based in Valhalla, New York, wrote in a
research report late yesterday. “We expect the market reaction
to disingenuous testing will be suspicion, and that will drive
investors and traders to step away from risk and back into
safety.”  
 The bank stress tests are due to be published on July 23.
