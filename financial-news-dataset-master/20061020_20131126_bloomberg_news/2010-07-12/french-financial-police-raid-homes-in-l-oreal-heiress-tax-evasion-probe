             French financial police raided the
Neuilly home of  L’Oreal SA  heiress  Liliane Bettencourt  late
today, her lawyer said. Bettencourt wasn’t home while the search
took place, lawyer  Georges Kiejman  said when reached by
telephone.  
 A total of seven raids were carried out today in connection
with the case, including one at the home of Bettencourt’s friend
Francois-Marie Banier, Astrid Granoux, a spokeswoman for the
Nanterre prosecutor’s office, said in a telephone interview.
Bettencourt’s home wasn’t included, she said.
