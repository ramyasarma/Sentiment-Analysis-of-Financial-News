             JPMorgan Chase & Co.  hired  Mel Martinez , a former U.S. senator and secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, as a senior executive for Florida, Mexico,
Central America and the Caribbean.  
 Martinez, who will be based in Orlando, Florida, will be
chairman for the region, the second-largest U.S. bank said today
in a statement distributed by Business Wire. He will serve on
the lender’s executive committee, according to the statement.  
 Martinez, 63, gave up his Florida Senate seat in August,
and Governer  Charlie Crist  appointed  George LeMieux  as his
replacement.  
 Martinez, a Republican, was secretary of Housing and Urban
Development under President  George W. Bush  from 2001 to 2003. He
was elected the first Cuban-American to the U.S. Senate in 2004.
