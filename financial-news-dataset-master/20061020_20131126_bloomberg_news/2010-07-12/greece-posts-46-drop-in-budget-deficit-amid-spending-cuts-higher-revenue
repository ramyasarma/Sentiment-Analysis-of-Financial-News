             Greece’s budget deficit shrank 46
percent in the first half of the year, preliminary data from the
Finance Ministry showed, as the government cut spending and
renewed efforts to increase revenue.  
 The shortfall, on a fiscal basis, fell to 9.65 billion
euros ($12.1 billion) from 17.87 billion euros in the year-
earlier period. That beat the government’s 39.5 percent target,
according to an e-mailed statement from the  Athens-based
ministry .  
 Net ordinary budget spending fell 12.8 percent, compared
with a goal of 5.5 percent for the year, according to the
statement. Ordinary budget revenue increased 7.2 percent in the
period, falling short of a 13.7 percent target.  
 Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said last week the
country may beat its target of reducing the budget gap, the
European Union’s second widest, to 8.1 percent of gross domestic
product from 13.6 percent as tax increases and spending cuts
kick in and the economy contracts less than forecast.  
 Today’s figures “don’t yet fully reflect all the fiscal
measures included in the government’s program for the year,”
according to the statement.  
 Meeting deficit targets is key to Greece receiving 110
billion euros of emergency loans agreed on by euro-area leaders
and the International Monetary Fund to stave off a default after
soaring borrowing costs locked Greece out of capital markets.
