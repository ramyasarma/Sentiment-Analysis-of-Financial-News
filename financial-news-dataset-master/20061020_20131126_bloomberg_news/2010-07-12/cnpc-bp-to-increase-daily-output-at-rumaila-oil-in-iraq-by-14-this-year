             China National Petroleum Corp., BP
Plc and a local partner may increase production at Rumaila,
Iraq’s biggest oilfield, by 14 percent by the year-end after
assuming full management of the block this month.  
 Daily crude production may rise to 1.17 million barrels
from more than 1.03 million barrels currently, CNPC  said  in a
statement on its website today.  
 BP and CNPC signed a 20-year service contract with Iraq in
November to increase Rumaila’s output to 2.85 million barrels a
day, making it the world’s second-largest producing oilfield,
the London-based producer said on Nov. 3. Iraq is seeking to
raise oil production to 6 million barrels a day by 2015 to boost
its war-ravaged economy.  
 A venture formed by CNPC, BP and Iraq’s state-owned South
Oil Co. formally took over operations and management of Rumaila
on July 1, the Beijing-based company said.  
 The contract was the only oilfield deal awarded by Iraq in
June in the first bidding round since the U.S.-led invasion in
2003.
