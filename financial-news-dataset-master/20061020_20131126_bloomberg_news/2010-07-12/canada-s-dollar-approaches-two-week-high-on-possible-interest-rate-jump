             Canada’s dollar weakened for the
first time in five days as stocks swung between gains and losses
before the start of the earnings season, making currencies tied
to commodities less attractive.  
 The currency, nicknamed the loonie, on July 9 capped its
first five-day advance in three weeks as increased demand for
higher-yielding assets pushed stocks and commodity prices higher
and a government report showed job growth in Canada beat
economists’ expectations fivefold. Oil, the nation’s largest
export, dropped for the first time in four days.  
 “We’re seeing a little bit of profit taking from last
week’s appreciation on the back of the Canadian jobs number as a
little bit of risk aversion emerges in equities,” said  Matthew Perrier , Toronto-based director of foreign exchange at Bank of
Montreal, the nation’s fourth-largest lender.  
 The Canadian currency dropped 0.4 percent to C$1.0375 per
U.S. dollar at 4:04 p.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0337 on
July 9, when it reached C$1.0296, the strongest level since June
23. One Canadian dollar buys 96.39 U.S. cents. U.S. stocks
gyrated, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped as much as
0.7 percent before closing up less than 0.1 percent.  
 The yield on Canada’s benchmark two-year  bond  fell 3 basis
points, the first decline in five sessions, to 1.68 percent. The
yield reached 1.771 percent on July 9, the highest since June
21. The 2 percent security due in September 2012 climbed 7 cents
to C$100.67.  
 The loonie earlier rose as much as much as 0.4 percent as
last week’s jobs data indicated the nation’s economy is
recovering, boosting speculation the Bank of Canada will raise
interest rates by at least 25 basis points on July 20.  
 Central Bank Expectations  
 Employment rose by 93,200 in June, following gains of
24,700 in May and April’s record 108,700, Statistics Canada said
on July 9. The  jobless rate  fell to 7.9 percent, the lowest
since January 2009, from 8.1 percent. The median forecast of 23
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for 20,000 added jobs
and an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent.  
 The Bank of Canada became last month the first Group of
Seven central bank to raise borrowing costs since the global
financial crisis began, increasing the target lending rate to
0.5 percent from a record low 0.25 percent.  
 “After Friday’s employment data, overnight index swap
rates have moved to almost fully price in a July 20 hike,”  Adam Cole , London-based global head of currency strategy at Royal
Bank of Canada, wrote in a note to clients. “While the analyst
community is also calling for a hike in September before
opinions split on whether the Bank of Canada will pause in
October.”
