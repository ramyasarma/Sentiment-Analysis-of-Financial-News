             South Korea’s won traded near a two-
week high and bonds fell as overseas investors  added  to their
holdings of the nation’s shares for a third day, seeking to
profit from the improving economy.  
 The central bank today raised its 2010 economic growth
forecast to 5.9 percent, from an April projection of 5.2 percent.
The Bank of Korea, which last week lifted its benchmark interest
rate by 25 basis points from a record-low 2 percent, also
increased its exports estimate to 26.4 percent from 18.6 percent
and doubled its prediction for this year’s current-account
surplus to $21 billion. Bond yields rose to a four-month high on
concern the central bank will further tighten monetary policy
this year.  
 “Fundamentals are really strong and that’s a positive,”
said  Hur Sang Hoon , a currency analyst at Korea Exchange Bank.
“That’s led to higher interest rates, which will attract
capital flows looking to take advantage of higher yields.”  
 The won traded at 1,198.08 per dollar as of 12:50 p.m. in
Seoul, from 1,195.85 at the end of last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s strengthened 4.3 percent in the past
month, the biggest gain among Asia’s 10 most-used currencies,
and today reached 1,193.75, the strongest level since June 24.
The yield on South Korea’s 3.75 percent bond due June 2013
climbed to a four-month high of 3.97 percent. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  
 Policy makers may intervene to check appreciation that
threatens exports, Korea Exchange Bank’s Hur said, predicting
that the currency may climb to 1,150 this week. The won is still
down 2.7 percent for the year, Asia’s worst performance.  
 Bonds Fall  
 Finance Minister Yoon Jeung Hyun said the chances of the
global economy slipping back into a recession this year are low,
Yonhap News reported yesterday. The government on June 24
boosted its 2010 growth forecast for South Korea to 5.8 percent
from a December projection of 5 percent, saying the global
recovery has spurred exports and local demand.  
 “Today’s upward revisions in Korea’s economy is pushing
bonds lower because that’s raising the possibility of more rate
hikes,” said  Peter Park , a fixed-income analyst at Woori
Investment & Securities in Seoul. Park expects the Bank of Korea
to raise borrowing costs by as much as 50 basis points by the
end of the year.  
 Higher borrowing costs will make investors “less
enthusiastic” about buying South Korean government bonds, Park
said.  
 Investors bid to buy 4.63 trillion won ($3.8 billion) of
five-year treasuries, or 2.89 times the amount on offer, the
Ministry of Economy and Finance said today. That’s the smallest
bid amount since March. South Korea sold 1.82 trillion won of
notes to yield 4.54 percent, the ministry said.
