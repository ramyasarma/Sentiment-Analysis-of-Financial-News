             Export capacity at Australia’s
Dalrymple Bay port may be 17 million tons less than expected
this year because of constraints, the Australian reported.  
 The port’s management held a briefing with customer Rio
Tinto Group to inform them of the restrictions, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The port may have the capacity to export 68 million to 71
million tons of the 85 million tons contracted to customers,
including Rio, it said.
