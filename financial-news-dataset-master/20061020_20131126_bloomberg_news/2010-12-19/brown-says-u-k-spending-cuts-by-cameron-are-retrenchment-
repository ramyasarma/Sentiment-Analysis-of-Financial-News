Former U.K. Prime Minister  Gordon Brown  said Britain’s spending cuts under his successor,
Conservative Party leader  David Cameron , to wipe out a record
budget deficit may harm the nation’s ability to compete in the
world economy.  “This is quite a unique period, where the restructuring of
the world economy is taking place,” said Brown in an interview
airing today on “CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS.”
Relying on “retrenchment in the hope that private investment
will recover of itself” won’t work, he said.  “You’ve got to prepare for the next stage,” Brown said.
“So cutting investment in education, universities, research,
science, technology, doesn’t make any sense to me.”  Cameron, whose government raised the sales tax and imposed
a levy on banks, in October proposed the U.K.’s biggest budget
cuts since World War II, with a goal of eliminating 490,000 jobs
and wiping out a record budget deficit by 2015.  In a separate interview on the same program, U.K.
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  defended the cuts,
saying they will keep Britain “a competitive place to do
business.”  “If we were not taking these measures, if we were not
being decisive in dealing with our deficit, where would Britain
be?” he said. “I think Britain would be in the firing line, at
the moment, of a sovereign debt crisis.”  Brown resigned as leader of Britain’s Labour Party in May
after being defeated in a general election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
