London’s Heathrow airport will
manage a “handful” of departures today and won’t be accepting
any arrivals as it works to clear snow and ice to allow for a
full re-opening tomorrow.  A change in temperature overnight led to a buildup of ice
at parking stands around planes, the airport said today on its
website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
