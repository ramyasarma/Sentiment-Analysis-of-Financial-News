Bernard Sucher , the former country
head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Russia, is joining
investment firm Aton Investment Group to help develop its
international strategy.  Sucher will start in January, said Alexei Karakhan, a
spokesman for Moscow-based Aton. The 50-year old American, who
quit Merrill Lynch in May after three years, will be a non-
executive board member at Aton.  “These days there is more of a need for an independent
adviser and player like Aton in the financial industry,”
Sucher said in an interview. Sucher said he would advise
the company on trading, asset management and international
expansion.  Russian equity and debt underwriting is dominated by state-
controlled  VTB Group , which is the most active in both markets,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Troika Dialog,
Russia’s oldest investment bank, may cede a one-third stake to
 OAO Sberbank , the biggest lender, RBC Daily reported Oct 1.  Sucher left Russian billionaire  Mikhail Fridman ’s
investment bank Alfa Capital Group, where he was chairman, to
join Merrill in 2007. Prior to joining Alfa, Sucher was a
managing director at Troika.  Aton was founded in 1991 by  Yevgeny Yuryev , who was
appointed in September as an adviser to Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev on welfare issues. Yuryev sold the firm’s equity
brokerage in 2006 to UniCredit SpA, retaining the asset
management business, then relaunched a new broker under the same
name last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
