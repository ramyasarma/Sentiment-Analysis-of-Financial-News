Local favorite Ernie Els won golf’s
South African Open for a fifth time, finishing one shot ahead of
countryman Retief Goosen in Durban today.  The 41-year-old Els finished on 25-under-par 263. Louis
Oosthuizen was 21-under and Charl Schwartzel 18-under in an all-
South African top four.  The last two rounds were played today following rain
delays, with each reduced to 17 holes as the fourth hole was
unplayable because of a waterlogged green.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
