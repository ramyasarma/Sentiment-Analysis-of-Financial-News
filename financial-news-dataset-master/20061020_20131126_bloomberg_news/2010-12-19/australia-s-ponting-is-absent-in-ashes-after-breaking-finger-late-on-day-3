Australia captain Ricky Ponting has
a “small fracture” in his left little finger and didn’t take
the field today as his team seeks a series-tying victory in the
third Ashes Test against England.  Ponting, 36 today, sustained the injury late on day three
when parrying an edge from Jonathan Trott that was caught by
Brad Haddin. The decision to keep him off the field was taken
after the Australian warm-up.  “Ricky Ponting had an X-ray last night that has confirmed
a small fracture of his left little finger,” Australia
physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
