Ladbrokes Plc , the U.K. bookmaker
founded in 1886, said it was in “very preliminary” talks with
online gaming company  888 Holdings Plc , after the Sunday
Telegraph reported it had made a 240-million pound ($373
million) bid.  “There can be no certainty that these discussions will
ultimately lead to an offer for 888 being made, nor as to the
terms of any such offer,” Harrow, England-based Ladbrokes said
in an e-mailed statement today. Andrew Benbow, a spokesman for
Gibraltar-based 888, declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News today.  Ladbrokes bid 70 pence a share for the Internet casino and
poker group it tried to acquire four years ago, the Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information. 888  stock 
jumped 13 percent to 49 pence in London trading on Friday, Dec.
17, valuing the company at 169 million pounds.  Ladbrokes Chief Executive Officer  Richard Glynn , who took
over in April, wants to increase Internet winnings, which have
been growing more slowly than those of rivals. The talks also
reflect pressure faced by gaming companies as competition
intensifies with the opening of markets in Europe and the U.S.  Governments are starting to allow online gambling companies
outside their borders to offer services in domestic markets and
bring currently illegal acts under the umbrella of taxation and
regulation.  Regulatory Changes  Online gambling in “offshore” markets, in which some
companies may have customers in countries with official bans,
expanded more than 10-fold between 2003 and 2010 to about 6.5
billion euros ($8.6 billion), according to H2 Gambling Capital,
a Manchester, England-based consulting firm.  The U.S., Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Ireland and Spain
are among countries that have revised or are considering
revising online gambling rules.  888, which supplies services to Harrah’s Entertainment Inc.
said last month that third-quarter total operating income was
$61 million, little changed from the year-earlier quarter.  Ladbrokes  shares  rose 0.4 percent on Dec. 17 in London to
close at 127.5 pence, valuing the company at 1.2 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
