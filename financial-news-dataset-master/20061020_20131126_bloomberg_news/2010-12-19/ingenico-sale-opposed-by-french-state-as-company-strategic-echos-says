The French government is opposed to
the sale of Ingenico SA to a foreign company because it regards
Ingenico’s technology as “strategic,” Les Echos reported in
its Dec. 20 edition, without citing anyone for the information.  Safran SA, the largest shareholder in Ingenico, views the
non-binding 28-euro a share bid Ingenico received as too low,
the French newspaper also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
