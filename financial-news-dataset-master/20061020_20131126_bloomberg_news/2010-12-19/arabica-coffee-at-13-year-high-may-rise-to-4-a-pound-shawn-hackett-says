Arabica coffee prices may be set for
a “straight up vertical spike” to a record $4 a pound by the
end of the first quarter with daily gains of 50 cents a pound
after climbing to a 13-year high last week, researcher  Shawn Hackett  said.  Coffee is no longer a “value commodity” and roasters are
facing a “panic stricken demand rationing orgy,” Hackett,
president of Hackett Financial Advisors Inc. in Boynton Beach,
Florida, wrote in a report dated Dec. 18. Prices for robusta
coffee traded in London may climb to $2,500 a metric ton on
rising demand from Asia and lack of  production  growth from
Vietnam, the world’s largest grower of the beans, Hackett said
by e-mail yesterday.  Rains in Latin America will likely keep coffee production
from exceeding output for the last two years, according to
Hackett. Arabica coffee will probably end the year at $3 a
pound, Hackett said.  Coffee futures in New York on Dec. 17 jumped to the 13-year
high of $2.267 a pound. Robusta coffee in London closed the week
at $1,986 a ton.  Rice, cocoa, lumber, milk and natural gas are commodities
that still have “pockets of value,” according to Hackett. The
 Continuous Commodity Index  of 17 raw materials futures will
probably climb to a record by year-end, he said in yesterday’s
e-mail. The index closed on Dec. 17 at 603.35 and the high is
615.04 on July 3, 2008, according to data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
