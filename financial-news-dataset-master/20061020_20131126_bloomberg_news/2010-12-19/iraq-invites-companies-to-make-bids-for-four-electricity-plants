Iraq invited bids for the
construction of four power plants to boost power-generation
capacity by 2,750 megawatts, the electricity ministry said.  The bids will be for a 1,250 megawatt plant near the
southern port city of Basra, and three 500 megawatt plants in
the cities of Samawa, Diwaniya and Amarah, the ministry said on
its  website .  The four should be built within 18 months, Sami al-Araji,
head of the country’s National Investment Commission, said in an
interview on Nov. 28.  Iraq, holder of the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves, is
struggling to raise power output, which was about 8,000
megawatts in April, just more than half of its domestic demand
of about 14,000 megawatts, according to government figures.
Iraqis currently receive power from the national grid for an
average of about one in every five hours.  Former Electricity Minister  Karim Wahid  quit in June amid
violent street protests triggered by severe seasonal summer
power shortages. Wahid said at the time that his efforts to
overcome the problem had been thwarted by a lack of funding and
fuel.  Prime Minister  Nuri al-Maliki  called in June for patience
and said it would take two years for power plants being built by
General Electric Co. and Siemens AG to come online and help
resolve power shortages.  The finance ministry said in June that it would issue bonds
to pay for contracts signed in 2008 with GE and Siemens to add
almost 9,000 megawatts of capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
