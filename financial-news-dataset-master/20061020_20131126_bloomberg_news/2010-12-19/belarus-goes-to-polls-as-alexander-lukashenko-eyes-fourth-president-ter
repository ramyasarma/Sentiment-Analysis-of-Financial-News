Belarus President  Alexander Lukashenko  headed for a landslide victory in today’s national
election, an exit poll said, as riot police attacked opponents
protesting what they claimed was massive vote rigging.  An exit poll by EcooM, a Minsk-based research company,
showed 79.1 percent of votes for Lukashenko, Interfax reported.
More than 84 percent of voters, almost 6 million people, had
cast their ballots as of 6 p.m. local time, the Central Election
Commission said on its website. Polling stations closed at 8
p.m., with preliminary results likely early tomorrow.  Opposition candidates, including former deputy Foreign
Minister  Andrei Sannikov , reported “mass” falsifications in
the vote that is poised to give Lukashenko a fourth term in
office he has held since 1994.  Lukashenko, 56, earlier today brushed off opponents’
accusations of vote-rigging, the Minsk-based Belta news service
said, and warned the opposition against unsanctioned meetings.  Riot police blocked entry to Minsk’s central square to
prevent opponents from staging a protest, Interfax reported.
Presidential candidate Vladimir Neklyaev was beaten up by police
and hospitalized, the Russian news service said.  Belarusian authorities turned the square into a skating
rink, decorating it with a Christmas tree before the election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
