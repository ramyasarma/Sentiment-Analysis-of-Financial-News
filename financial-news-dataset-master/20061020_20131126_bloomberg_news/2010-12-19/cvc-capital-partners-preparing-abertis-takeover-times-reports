CVC Capital Partners Ltd., which
bought a minority stake in  Abertis Infraestructuras SA  earlier
this year, is preparing a 12 billion-euro ($15.8 billion)
takeover bid for the Spanish company, the  Sunday Times  said,
without saying where it got the information.  CVC would need to raise about 8 billion euros for the
takeover of the Spanish  toll-road  and airport operator,
according to the Sunday Times.  Two spokespeople for Abertis, who declined to be
identified, declined to comment when contacted by telephone
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
