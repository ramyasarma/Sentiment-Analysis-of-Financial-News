Napoli and Lazio narrowed the gap to
leader AC Milan with last-gasp victories in Italian soccer’s
Serie A, while 10-man Real Madrid won to stay two points behind
leader Barcelona in Spain.  Edinson Cavani’s 90th-minute goal gave Napoli a 1-0 home
win against Lecce yesterday that lifted it to 33 points, three
behind AC Milan, which lost 1-0 to Roma two days ago.  Lazio also has 33 points after an 88th-minute own goal by
Udinese’s Christian Zapata completed a 3-2 win. Juventus is two
points further back after allowing a 90th-minute tying goal by
Sergio Pellissier in a 1-1 draw at Chievo.  Barcelona leads the Spanish standings with 43 points after
defeating city rival Espanyol 5-1 two days ago. Angel di Maria
got the only goal in the 77th minute last night as Real Madrid
beat Sevilla in a match where both teams finished with 10 men.  Real’s  Ricardo Carvalho  was red-carded after 63 minutes,
and Mouhamadou Dabo of Sevilla was sent off in the last minute.  Borussia Dortmund suffered its second league defeat of the
German Bundesliga season two days ago, 1-0 at Eintracht
Frankfurt. Dortmund leads with 43 points, 10 ahead of Mainz and
Bayer Leverkusen.  Lyon missed the chance to go top in France by drawing 1-1
at Marseille. Lille, Paris Saint-Germain and Rennes top the
standings with 31 points, one ahead of Lyon.  In the Netherlands, PSV Eindhoven beat Roda JC 3-1
yesterday and leads by four points from FC Twente, whose Dec. 17
game with Heracles Almelo was among European matches that were
postponed because of snow and ice. Third-place Ajax, two points
further back, had its match against Feyenoord postponed.  WEEKEND RESULTS
