Flights at Paris’s Charles de Gaulle
Airport will be reduced by 40 percent beginning at 4 p.m. Paris
time today because of snowfall in northern France, the nation’s
civil aviation authority said in an e-mailed statement.  The reductions will last through the end of the day,
according to the statement. Previously, flights had been cut by
25 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
