Quarterbacks Brett Favre of the
Minnesota Vikings and Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers
were ruled out of games because of injuries.  The Vikings said today that Favre was not available for
their home game in two days against the Chicago Bears because of
his injured shoulder. Joe Webb will start as quarterback in the
Monday Night Football game. It will be Favre’s second straight
missed game after a National Football League record 297
consecutive starts.  The Packers downgraded Rodgers to “out” for tomorrow
night’s game at New England. Matt Flynn will make his first NFL
start for Green Bay.  Rodgers, who is recovering from a concussion, had started
every game since taking over from Favre as the Packers’ starter
at the beginning of the 2008 season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
