All three of today’s English Premier
League soccer games, including leader Manchester United’s match
at Chelsea, have been called off because of snowfalls affecting
much of Britain.  Blackpool versus Tottenham and West Brom against
Wolverhampton are also off, following four cancellations on
yesterday’s schedule: Arsenal-Stoke, Birmingham-Newcastle,
Liverpool-Fulham and Wigan-Aston Villa. Manchester City can go
top of the standings if it beats Everton in a game still
scheduled for tomorrow.  Chelsea said on its  website  that the game with United was
postponed “following consultation with the police and the local
authority.”  Much of England’s Football League program and the soccer
schedule in Scotland were also disrupted by snow and ice, as
were horserace meetings. Today’s Heineken Cup Pool One rugby
match between Edinburgh and Castres was called off.  Two Premier League games went ahead yesterday.  Danny Welbeck  scored the only goal as Sunderland jumped over Bolton
into sixth place. In the day’s other game, Blackburn tied last-
place West Ham 1-1 in its first match since manager  Sam Allardyce  was fired.  Junior Stanislas’s goal in the 78th minute gave West Ham
the draw at Blackburn, which scored through  Ryan Nelsen . Interim
manager Steve Kean led Rovers after Allardyce was fired six days
ago by the club’s new owner.  The draw extends West Ham’s away winless run to 27 games,
dating back to the opening day of last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
