Australia captain Ricky Ponting has
a “small fracture” in his left little finger though may take
his place in the field today as his team seeks a series-tying
victory in the third Ashes Test against England, Cricket
Australia said in a statement.  Ponting sustained the injury last night when parrying an
edge from Jonathan Trott that was caught by Brad Haddin.  Play at the WACA Ground in Perth is scheduled to begin at
10:30 a.m. local time. Australia needs another five wickets to
tie the best-of-five contest at 1-1 with England struggling at
81-5 chasing 391 for victory.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
