Lindsey Vonn , the three-time
defending World Cup overall ski champion, won today’s super-
combined race to follow her victory in yesterday’s downhill.
Fellow American  Ted Ligety  won the men’s giant slalom.  The 26-year-old Vonn beat Austria’s  Elisabeth Goergl  and
 Nicole Hosp  in Val d’Isere, France, to regain a narrow overall
World Cup lead, three points ahead of Germany's  Maria Riesch , 
 according to  governing body Federation Internationale de Ski.  Vonn had the fastest time in today’s super-G run, then was
seventh in the slalom.  Ligety continued his dominance in the giant slalom, having
now won all three races in the discipline this season. Cyprien
Richard of France was second today.  Ligety has a maximum 300 points, with Norway’s  Aksel Lund Svindal  on 165. In the overall competition, Ligety has 321
points, with  Silvan Zurbriggen  of Switzerland on 315.  To contact the reporter on this story:
