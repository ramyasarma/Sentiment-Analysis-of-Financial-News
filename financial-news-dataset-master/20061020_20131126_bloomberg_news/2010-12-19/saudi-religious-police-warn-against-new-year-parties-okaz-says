Saudi Arabia’s religious police have
warned people against having New Year celebrations in the
kingdom,  Okaz  newspaper reported, citing a statement from the
Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.  Shops will be punished for selling material to celebrate
the New Year and their items seized by authorities, the Jeddah-
based newspaper said. The religious police plan to increase
patrols in public areas ahead of the New Year, though they don’t
plan to enter private homes, the newspaper said.  The world’s largest oil exporter is a Sunni Muslim-majority
country, where unmarried men and women are prevented from
mingling and religious law is enforced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
