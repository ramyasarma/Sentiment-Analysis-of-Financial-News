Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication
Corp. , the country’s largest communications company, said its
board is considering a  distribution of 3 billion shekels  ($835
million).  The  company  is weighing the timing and whether the payment
will be a cash dividend, share buyback or combination of both,
Tel Aviv-based Bezeq said today in a statement to the city’s
stock exchange.  “The company again has proved to be a cash cow,”  Yuval Amiram , head of institutional sales at Tel Aviv-based IBI said
by telephone. The dividend would be “one of the biggest” ever
paid in Israel, he said.  The  shares  rose the most in two weeks, increasing 2.4
percent to 10.20 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  To contact the reporter on this story:
