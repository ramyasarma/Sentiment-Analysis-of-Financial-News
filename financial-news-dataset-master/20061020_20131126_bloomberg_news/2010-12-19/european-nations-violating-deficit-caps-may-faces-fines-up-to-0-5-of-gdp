Euro-area governments may under
European Commission proposals be fined as much as 0.5 percent of
their countries’ gross domestic product if they ignore
recommendations to fix economic imbalances, European Union
President  Herman Van Rompuy  said.  The commission “will develop a number of indicators that
show if a country gets into problems economically,” and “we’ll
check that for the first time in March,” Van Rompuy said in an
interview in Dutch on the television program “Buitenhof”
today. Any country that ignores a recommendation to correct
those problems will be punished “immediately,” he said.  The sanctions will include interest- and non-interest-
bearing deposits with the central bank or another organization
“in the first phase” and may lead to fines of 0.2 percent to
0.5 percent of GDP, Van Rompuy said. Additional new sanctions
aren’t needed, he said.  As the Greece-led debt crisis forced European governments
and the European Central Bank to take emergency rescue measures,
Germany demanded automatic penalties for future deficit
violators. EU leaders agreed last week to amend the bloc’s
treaties to create a permanent crisis-management mechanism in
2013 and Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said
yesterday that additional decisions will be needed.  No country has been fined in the euro’s almost 12-year
history for overstepping the EU’s deficit limit.  To contact the reportesr on this story:
