Chelsea plans to boost its attack
with moves for Manchester City forward Carlos Tevez and
Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko, the News of the World reported,
without citing anyone.  Chelsea, which has scored only four goals in its last seven
matches in English soccer’s Premier League, would have to pay at
least 70 million pounds ($109 million) for the pair, the
newspaper said  Tevez would be interested in a move after falling out with
officials at Manchester City and requesting a transfer, while
there is a 34 million-pound buyout clause in Dzeko’s contract,
the News of the World reported.  Blues strikers Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka have 10
league goals between them this season. Drogba, 32, wants an
extension to his contract, which has 18 months to run, but the
club is currently unwilling to discuss a new deal, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
