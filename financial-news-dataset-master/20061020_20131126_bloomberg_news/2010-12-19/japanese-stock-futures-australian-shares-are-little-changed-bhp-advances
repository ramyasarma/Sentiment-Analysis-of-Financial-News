Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian shares were little changed as Oracle Corp. and
Research In Motion Ltd. reported higher-than-estimated earnings,
while concern mounted that Europe’s debt crisis will spread.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. , a Japanese
camera maker that gets about 80 percent of its sales abroad,
rose 0.3 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. The euro
weakened against the yen to its lowest level in almost two weeks,
cutting the outlook for export earnings. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s No. 1 mining company and Australia’s top oil producer,
climbed 0.2 percent in Sydney today as commodity prices gained.  “Worries about whether Europe has a system to handle debt
crises may affect Japanese stocks through the currency,” said
 Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho
Securities Co.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,300 in Chicago on Dec. 17, compared with
10,290 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,290 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index lost 0.7 percent in Wellington.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent in New
York on Dec. 17 to 1,243.91, its highest close since September
2008, as better-than-projected earnings forecasts at Oracle and
Research In Motion plus the takeover of a regional bank
overshadowed concern Europe’s debt crisis will spread.  European Debt  European stocks fell on Dec. 17 as an agreement among the
region’s leaders to create a crisis-management mechanism failed
to ease concern that some euro-area nations can’t repay their
debts. Ireland’s credit rating was cut five levels by Moody’s
Investors Service on Dec. 17.  Crude oil for January delivery rose 0.4 percent on Dec. 17,
and the  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including
copper and aluminum rallied 1 percent that day, the first gain
in four days.  The euro depreciated to as low as 110.40 against the yen
today in Tokyo, its weakest level since Dec. 7. A weaker euro
reduces the value of European income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 11 percent through
yesterday in 2010, compared with gains of 12 percent by the S&P
500 and 8.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.7 times estimated earnings on
average at the close on Dec. 17, versus 14.6 times for the S&P
500 and 12.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
