Northampton won 23-19 at Cardiff
Blues in rugby’s Heineken Cup today to record a fourth straight
win and extend its lead atop Pool One.  Calum Clark got a try, while Stephen Myler kicked six
penalties as Northampton  moved to 16 points , seven ahead of
Castres, which will play its match against Edinburgh tomorrow
after snow forced a postponement today.  Leicester and Perpignan tied 22-22 in Pool Five, where both
are only two points behind the Scarlets -- a 38-15 winner
against Treviso yesterday.  Two-time champion Wasps top Pool Six following a 37-10
victory against Newport Gwent Dragons. Toulouse, which last
season won the competition for a record fourth time, will take
top spot if it beats Glasgow Warriors in a match rescheduled for
Dec. 21.  Yesterday, Leinster beat Clermont Auvergne 24-8 to stay
atop Pool Two, while two days ago Saracens defeated Racing Metro
19-14. Ospreys beat Munster 19-15 in Pool Three, and Toulon
defeated London Irish 38-17. Ulster won at Bath 26-22 to remain
second in Pool Four behind Biarritz, a 34-3 winner against
Aironi on Dec. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
