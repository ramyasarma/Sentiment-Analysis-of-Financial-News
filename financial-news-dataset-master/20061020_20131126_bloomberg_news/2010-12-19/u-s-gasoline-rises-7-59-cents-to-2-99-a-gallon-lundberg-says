The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 7.59 cents to $2.988 a
gallon, according to a survey.  The price covers the two-week period ended Dec. 17 and is
derived from data provided by 2,500 filling stations nationwide
to  Trilby Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst in
Camarillo, California.  “The retail rise would have exceeded a 10-cent rise if it
wasn’t for oil’s slippage of $1.17 a barrel, which equates to
nearly 3 cents a gallon equivalent,” Lundberg said in a
telephone interview.  Crude oil for January delivery fell 1.3 percent in the
period, dropping $1.17 to $88.02 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Crude fell as the dollar gained 1.8 percent
against the euro as of 3:23 p.m. on Dec. 17 in New York,
reducing the investment appeal of dollar-denominated
commodities.  Oil may decline this week, according to a survey by
Bloomberg News. Eighteen of 34 analysts, or 53 percent, forecast
prices will fall through Dec. 23. Nine respondents, or 26
percent, predicted prices will rise and seven estimated there
would be little change.  Gasoline Price Gain  The current price of retail gasoline is 39.16 cents above
the year ago price of $2.5964 on Dec. 18, 2009, Lundberg said.  “It’s a wide differential and the gain comes from crude
oil price increases in late November and early December,” she
said. Whether gasoline climbs to $3 a gallon by the end of the
year depends on the “fluctuation in crude prices,” which are
“driving the price of gasoline more than usual,” she said.
“There aren’t other issues; we have a surplus of gasoline, a
surplus of refining capacity and high unemployment.”  U.S. crude oil  supplies  tumbled 9.85 million barrels in the
week ended Dec. 10, according to the Energy Department. It was
the biggest one-week decline since the seven days ended Sept.
27, 2002, on a per-barrel basis. Imports decreased 15 percent to
the lowest level since September 2008.  Crude  inventories  at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point
for New York futures, increased by 982,000 barrels to 35.9
million, the highest level since August.  Gasoline for front-month delivery dropped 1.5 percent to
$2.3178 a gallon in the two weeks ended Dec. 17.  Gasoline Stockpiles  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  expanded 809,000 barrels to 214.8
million, the fourth straight gain. Gasoline  demand , as measured
by what refiners and blenders supply to wholesalers, rose 1.9
percent to a seven-week high, according to the department.  U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump in the week ended Dec. 10
fell 2.7 percent from the prior week, according to  MasterCard
Inc.  in its Dec. 14 SpendingPulse report.  On Long Island, regular gasoline averaged $3.26 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.23 a
gallon.  The highest price in the continental U.S. was in San
Francisco, at $3.29 a gallon. The cheapest place to buy the fuel
was Denver, where a gallon of gasoline averaged $2.68, Lundberg
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
