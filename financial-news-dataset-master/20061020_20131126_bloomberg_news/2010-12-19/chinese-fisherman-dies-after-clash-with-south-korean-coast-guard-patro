One Chinese crewman died and another
remains missing after their fishing boat capsized following a
collision yesterday with a South Korean patrol vessel.  Eight of the Chinese boat’s crew of 10 were rescued and a
search for the missing fisherman is continuing today, said Rho
Sang Jue, a spokesman for the  Korea Coast Guard  in the port city
of Gunsan, 110 miles (180 kilometers) south of Seoul.  Four members of the Coast Guard crew were injured in a
fight that broke out when they attempted to board the fishing
boat, which had entered South Korean waters off Gunsan, the
Coast Guard said in a statement yesterday.  About 330 Chinese boats have been captured for illegal
fishing in South Korean waters this year, Choi Suy Young, a
Coast Guard inspector, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
