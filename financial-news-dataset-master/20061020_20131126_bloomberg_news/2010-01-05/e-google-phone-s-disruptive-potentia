             The coverage of Google's Nexus One "superphone" — officially unveiled today — was swift and  almost universally positive . The HTC-designed device looks beautiful, its functionality sounds fantastic, and by all accounts it looks like a viable competitor to Apple and Research in Motion in the smartphone market. 

 In this case, however, there's more to the story.  Google's distribution approach has the potential to dramatically accelerate a broad disruption in the mobile phone market where the balance of power shifts from carriers and retailers to device, software, and applications providers. 

 Apple's iPhone has clearly been  a phenomenal success , but my biggest complaint upon its launch was Apple's reliance on the traditional cellphone model. It formed an exclusive deal with AT&T, locking users into a particular network (and creating frustration in some markets where heavy iPhone use slowed AT&T's network). Of course, Apple sells the phones through its own retail channel, but it still follows  a fairly traditional model. 

 Google's model has an important twist. Instead of buying the phone from a carrier, consumers will buy the phone directly from Google's Web site. 

 Right now service is available only on T-Mobile in the US, but presumably this will shift over time as more carriers come on board and Google creates more devices.  As Silicon Alley's Dan Frommer noted , "Google could get even wilder with this storefront, mixing and matching service from multiple carriers, offering data-only subscriptions and subsidies, and even its own Google Voice phone service over VoIP." 

 Of course, there's still significant work before Google realizes this disruptive potential, but the potential is there.  

 Last year I noted how 2010 would be a big year for Google . Would the company be able to show that it could create viable business models that go beyond its core search-based advertising market? If Nexus One is any indication, Google is off to a great start.
