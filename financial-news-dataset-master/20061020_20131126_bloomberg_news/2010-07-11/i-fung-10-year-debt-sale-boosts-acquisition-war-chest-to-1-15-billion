             Li & Fung Ltd. , the biggest supplier
to retailers including  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  and  Target Corp. ,
increased its funds for acquisitions to about $1.15 billion with
the sale of 10-year debt.  
 The supplier of consumer goods ranging from  Tommy Hilfiger 
clothes and  Kate Spade  bags to furniture, cosmetics and toys
said in a July 9 statement that it raised $350 million selling a
second batch of dollar-denominated notes following a sale in May.  
 The announcement came a day after  Li & Fung  announced three
acquisitions and four agreements that may increase sales by
$1 billion next year. The Hong Kong-based company is reviewing
more possible  purchases  with “the deal pipeline being extremely
strong; maybe never as strong as today,” CLSA Ltd. analysts
 Aaron Fischer ,  Huei Suen Ng  and  Mariana Kou  said in a July 8
note to clients, citing the company.  
 “They’re constantly looking to add to their range of
sourcing capabilities,”  Matt Marsden , a consumer-sector equity
researcher at Samsung Securities (Asia) Ltd. in Hong Kong, said
yesterday. “According to management guidance, they would have
total finances available of US$1.15bn in their acquisition war
chest after this fundraising.”  
 President  Bruce Rockowitz  said on July 8 that the company
had about $800 million left in its takeover fund.  
 Li & Fung  dropped 0.66 percent to close at HK$37.55 in Hong
Kong trading while the  Hang Seng Index  advanced 0.44 percent.
Li & Fung has climbed 16 percent  this year , making it the best
performer on the  benchmark .  
 Raising Funds  
 The latest bonds will mature on May 13, 2020, and pay
interest of 5.25 percent a year, the company said in its
 statement  to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Li & Fung  “intends
to raise funding through the issue of the new notes primarily
for business development and acquisitions,” it said.  
 Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
managed the debt sale.  
 The sale added to a $400 million fundraising by  Li & Fung 
in May, it said. The company has $500 million of bonds due in
2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The outsourcer said on July 8 it paid $140 million to buy
three companies: Jackel Group, with packaging, perfume and
personal-care businesses, denim clothing company HTP Group, and
Cipriani Accessories Inc., which it described as a designer,
distributor and importer of accessories in the U.S., Canada and
Mexico.  
 L’Oreal, Coty  
 Jackel’s clients include  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
SA ,  L’Oreal SA  and  Coty Inc. , according to Rockowitz.  
 Li & Fung  also signed a licensing agreement with  Sean John ,
the brand started by rap artist  Sean “Diddy” Combs . It entered
into a partnership with fashion stylist  Rachel Zoe  to create
women’s clothes, shoes, bags, jewelry and accessories. The
outsourcer expanded a licensing agreement with sportswear
marketer TapouT and formed a company with Star Branding with
partners that include  Tommy  and  Andy Hilfiger .  
 Rockowitz has been acquiring rivals and entering into
agreements, including one signed with Wal-Mart in January that
may generate $2 billion of additional revenue in the first year.
The  Li & Fung  president, who joined the outsourcing specialist
after his company was acquired more than nine years ago, has
said the July 8 announcements are “the tip of the iceberg.”  
 Li & Fung,  founded  as a porcelain and silk trader in
southern China in 1906 near the end of the Qing dynasty, derived
64 percent of last year’s HK$104.5 billion ($13.5 billion) sales
from the U.S.  
 It has  forecast  revenue of $3 billion this year for its U.S.
onshore business, under which goods are imported for clients.
The rest of its sales are generated by charging a fee for
organizing factories and raw materials to make consumer products
such as clothes, toys and furniture.  
 It has a network of about 12,000 suppliers, with about half
of its goods sourced from China.  
 Li & Fung  has set a sales target of $20 billion this year.
Rockowitz didn’t comment during the July 8 interview on whether
it would meet the target.
