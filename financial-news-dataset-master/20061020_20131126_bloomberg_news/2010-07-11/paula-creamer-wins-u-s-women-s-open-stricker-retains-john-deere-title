             Paula Creamer  won the U.S. Women’s
Open by four strokes for her ninth victory on the LPGA Tour and
first major tournament title.  
 Creamer, 23, finished at 3-under-par at Oakmont Country
Club in Oakmont, Pennsylvania, the only golfer in the field to
break par over four rounds. She shot a 2-under 69 during the
final day after rounds of 72, 70 and 70. South Korea’s  Na Yeon Choi  and Norway’s  Suzann Pettersen  tied for second at 1-over.  
 Creamer receives $585,000 and is the second American in the
past six years to win the title, following  Cristie Kerr ’s
victory in 2007. Creamer was making her fourth start since
having thumb surgery and played with a bandaged hand.  
 “My hand has been in a lot of pain,” Creamer said in a
televised interview. “I just stuck to my game plan on every
hole. I really just tried to do what we planned and I executed
and it makes it so much sweeter.”  
 On the U.S. PGA Tour,  Steve Stricker  defended his title at
the John Deere Classic to join  Ernie Els ,  Jim Furyk  and  Justin Rose  as a two-time winner this season.  
 Stricker set a tour record at 25-under-par through 54 holes
and closed with a 1-under-par 70 to beat  Paul Goydos  by two
strokes at TPC Deere Run in Silvis, Illinois.  
 Stricker receives $792,000 for winning the final event
before the British Open, which is scheduled for July 15-18 at
St. Andrews in Scotland.  
 Goydos, who in the first round became the fourth PGA Tour
player to shoot 59, qualifies for the British Open by finishing
runner-up because Stricker was already in the field for the
third major championship of the year.
