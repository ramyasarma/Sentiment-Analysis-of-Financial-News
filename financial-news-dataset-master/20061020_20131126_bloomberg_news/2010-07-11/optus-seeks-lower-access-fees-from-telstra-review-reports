             Optus, a unit of Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd., wants to pay lower fees for access to
Telstra Corp.’s copper home phone network in Australia after the
nation’s government struck a deal with Telstra, the Australian
Financial Review reported, citing Optus.  
 Optus is preparing to tell the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission that fees that were ruled last year should
be recalculated after an agreement between Telstra and the
government’s National Broadband Network, it said, citing Andrew
Sheridan, the general manager of regulation at Optus.
