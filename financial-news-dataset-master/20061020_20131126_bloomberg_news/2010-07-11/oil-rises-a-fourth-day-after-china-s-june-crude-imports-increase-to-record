             Oil fell in New York for the first
time in four days as traders sold contracts to lock in gains
following a rally to a one-week high above $76 a barrel.  
 Oil rose earlier as China, the world’s second-largest
energy consumer, reported crude imports reached a record in June.
Retail sales in the U.S., the biggest energy user, probably fell
in June for a second month and industrial production cooled,
signs the expansion will moderate in the second half, economists
said before reports this week.  
 “Some profit-taking is coming into the market,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity derivatives sales manager at broker
Newedge Group in Tokyo. “From a technical point of view, $76.50
near last week’s highs is around a level to sell. This market
will continue to be range-bound.”  
 Crude for August delivery dropped as much as 49 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $75.60 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was at $75.64 at 2:22 p.m.
Singapore time, earlier reaching $76.43. Futures, up 27 percent
in the past year, have lost 4.7 percent in 2010.  
 China’s net crude purchases climbed to 22.14 million metric
tons in June, beating the previous record of 20.98 million tons
in April, according to preliminary data from the General
Administration of Customs on July 10. Imports surged 30 percent
in the first half of this year on higher demand and lower costs.
The country paid an average of $77.20 a barrel for crude in June,
compared with $82.50 in May.  
 “The Chinese trade data was quite strong for crude oil
imports,” said  David Moore , a commodity strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “U.S. demand has
picked up over the year, but the strongest growth is in the
developing economies.”  
 Weekly Gain  
 Oil increased 5.5 percent last week, the biggest rally in
six weeks, as declining U.S. crude stockpiles and a drop in
jobless claims bolstered speculation the country would sustain
its economic recovery.  
 U.S. commercially held oil  inventories  tumbled 4.96 million
barrels in the week ended July 2, the most since September, as
refiners boosted operating rates, the Energy Department said in
a July 8 report.  Fuel demand  rose 3.2 percent to 19.6 million
barrels a day, the highest since the week to May 28.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reduced
their net-long position in New York oil futures for a second
week, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed.  
 Speculative long positions , or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 26,215 contracts in the week
ended July 6, the Washington-based commission said July 9 in its
Commitments of Traders report.  
 Brent crude for August settlement fell as much as 51 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $74.91 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was at $74.95 at 2:21 p.m. Singapore
time. On July 9, the contract climbed 71 cents, or 1 percent, to
$75.42, settling higher for a third day.
