             HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest
lender, said it conducted its first cross-border renminbi trade
settlement transaction in the U.K. as China seeks to increase
the use of the currency in global trade.  
 The yuan deal was carried out on behalf of Sheffield,
England-based gardening-equipment company Neill Tools Ltd., a
subsidiary of  Spear & Jackson Plc , HSBC said in an e-mailed
statement in London today.  
 China, the world’s third-largest economy, is seeking to
reduce its reliance on the U.S. dollar and promote the yuan as a
global currency. The People’s Bank of China said on June 22 it
expanded the use of the yuan for cross-border trade settlement
to 20 provinces and cities, allowing companies based in those
areas to use the currency to pay for goods and services.  
 China also last month scrapped the yuan’s two-year peg to
the dollar, a measure aimed at deflecting criticism from its
trading partners. The amount of Chinese international trade
denominated in the currency will increase to about 30 percent in
five years, HSBC said in the statement.
