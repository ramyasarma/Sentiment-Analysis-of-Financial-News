             New Zealand said China may become
its largest trading partner, overtaking Australia, as it seeks
to double trade between the countries to NZ$20 billion ($14
billion) in five years.  
 “In the medium term that’s going to be the case,” New
Zealand Prime Minister  John Key  said in an interview on TVNZ
today.  
 Trade between the two countries has surged since the
signing of a free trade agreement in 2008, which will gradually
eliminate tariffs on 96 percent of New Zealand exports by 2019.
Last year, exports to China surged 43 percent, defying the
performance with most other trading partners, according to Key.  
 “The tariffs that we pay are reducing every year, so every
year we’re becoming more competitive in terms of our goods,”
Key said. “And then the Chinese population is getting
wealthier.”  
 While Key expects increased Chinese investment in New
Zealand, he doesn’t support the sale of the nation’s farms to
any foreign buyers.  
 “My general view is, if we sell farms offshore in large
numbers, that’s not a good thing for New Zealand, simply because
I don’t think it adds a lot of value,” Key said.
