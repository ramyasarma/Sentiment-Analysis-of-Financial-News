             Some members of the ruling
Democratic Party of Japan called for Secretary-General Yukio
Edano and other executives to step down after the coalition
government lost control of parliament’s upper house in an
election, Kyodo News said, citing party officials it didn’t
identify.  
 There is also talk in the party about firing Jun Azumi, the
DPJ’s campaign chief, Nikkei English News said in a separate
report today.
