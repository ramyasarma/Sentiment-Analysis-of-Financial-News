             Retail sales in the U.S. fell in
June for a second month and industrial production cooled, signs
the expansion will moderate in the second half, economists said
before reports this week.  
 Purchases  fell 0.3 percent after a 1.2 percent decline in
May, according to the median estimate of 59 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey ahead of figures due July 14. Production
at factories, mines and utilities declined 0.1 percent last
month, the Federal Reserve may report the next day.  
 Target Corp.  and  Gap Inc.  were among retailers whose sales
in June trailed forecasts as limited hiring and reduced housing
wealth restrain spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the
economy. Few price pressures and signs of slower growth
encouraged Fed policy makers last month to renew a pledge to
hold interest rates close to zero.  
 “Consumer spending is subdued and economic growth isn’t
going to be as strong as we’ve had,” said  Brian Bethune , chief
U.S. financial economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
Massachusetts. “With employment still weak and asset prices
under pressure, the drumbeat of downbeat news is holding things
down. Inflation isn’t an issue for the Fed.”  
 The Commerce Department’s retail sales report will show
purchases  excluding automobiles  were unchanged last month,
according to the survey median.  
 Auto sales fell to an annual pace of 11.1 million vehicles
last month from May,  industry data  showed. General Motors Co.
and  Ford Motor Co. , the two largest U.S. automakers, reported
lower-than-anticipated sales.  
 European Debt Crisis  
 Europe’s debt crisis, which has pushed share prices lower
and shaken consumer and business confidence, poses a risk to the
U.S. recovery. The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  has fallen 11
percent from its April 23 high. The S&P Supercomposite Retailing
 gauge  is down 20 percent from this year’s peak on April 26.  
 “Less supportive” financial conditions were cited by Fed
officials on June 23, when they reaffirmed forecasts for a
“moderate” pace of growth and kept interest rates unchanged.
Minutes of the meeting are due on July 14, and policy makers
will also release their updated economic forecasts.  
 The outlook for household spending also reflects the waning
of government incentives such as rebates to buy energy-efficient
appliances that spurred retail sales earlier this year.  
 While an industrywide measure of sales at stores open at
least a year rose in June for the 10th consecutive month,
results trailed analysts’ estimates. Sales last month at 30
chains rose 3.1 percent after a 2.7 percent gain in May, Retail
Metrics Inc. said on July 8. Analysts estimated a 3.5 percent
increase.  
 Target, American Eagle  
 Minneapolis-based Target, the second-largest U.S. discount
retailer, reported a gain that included strong demand for food
and clothing and “particularly soft” purchases of electronics
and music.  
 Teen clothing chain  American Eagle Outfitters Inc.  posted a
drop from a year earlier compared with forecasts for an
increase, and said weak sales necessitated deeper promotions.
Sales were unchanged at Gap, the San Francisco-based owner of
Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores.  
 “June was a difficult month with lighter traffic than we
anticipated,” Gap’s Chief Financial Officer  Sabrina Simmons 
said in a July 8 statement.  
 Department stores fared better last month as price cuts and
record high temperatures on the East Coast pushed more shoppers
into air-conditioned malls.  Nordstrom Inc. , J.C. Penney Co. and
Macy’s Inc. topped analysts’ average estimates.  
 Consumer Spending Forecast  
 Economists trimmed projections for consumer spending this
year, to an average of 2.4 percent from 2.5 percent a month ago,
according to a Bloomberg monthly survey taken July 1 to July 8.
They also marked down the 2010 growth estimate and said the
jobless rate, which reached a 26-year high of 10.1 percent in
October 2009, will average 9.6 percent this year.  
 Manufacturing, which has fueled the recovery that began in
the middle of 2009, also is settling into a more sustainable
pace as companies see less need to rebuild inventories and wait
for demand to strengthen.  
 Economists forecast a July 15 report from the Fed will show
a drop in industrial production in June after a 1.3 percent
surge the previous month.  
 The same day, regional Fed figures are forecast to show  New
York  area factories expanded at a slower pace in July, while
manufacturing growth in the  Philadelphia  region was little
changed.  
 Inflation receded in June, Labor Department reports are
forecast to show. The consumer price index declined 0.1 percent
in June after falling in May, according to the Bloomberg survey
before the July 16 report. Excluding food and energy,  core 
consumer prices rose 0.9 percent from the same month in 2009,
matching the smallest year-over-year gain since 1966, the survey
showed.  
 Import prices  declined for a second month, while  producer
costs  were down for the third consecutive time, reports earlier
in the week may show.
