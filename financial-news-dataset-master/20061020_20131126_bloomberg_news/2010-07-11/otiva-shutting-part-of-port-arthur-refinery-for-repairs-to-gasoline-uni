             Motiva Enterprises LLC is curtailing
operations at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, because of a
leak tied to part of the main gasoline producing unit.  
 The waste heat boiler at the fluid catalytic cracking unit
sprung a leak, the company said in a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.  
 “In order to prevent an emergency shut down with
subsequent emissions, a plan is in place to conduct an orderly
shutdown,” according to the filing. Repairs will begin
tomorrow, the filing shows.  
 Motiva is a venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Saudi
Arabian Oil Co.  
 The Port Arthur plant can process 285,000 barrels of crude
oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The refinery
produces gasoline, aviation fuel, diesel, industrial fuel oil
and petrochemical feedstocks, according to a Motiva website.
