             Emirates National Oil Co., the
government-owned refiner with assets of $6 billion in Dubai,
ended its offshore bunkering operations in Fujairah in the
United Arab Emirates as of July 1, the company said, referring
to the supply of marine fuel, also known as bunker fuel.  
 “Over the past months, the bunkering business had been
facing challenges in certain key areas, which were not in line
with the management growth outlook,” ENOC said in a statement
received by e-mail today. “In the current business environment,
it was not prudent to continue with the offshore bunkering
operations.”  
 The global economic also had a significant impact on the
shipping industry, which further affected marine fuel suppliers
in the region, it said. The company’s other operations in
Fujairah, including onshore bunkering, continue as normal,
according to the statement.
