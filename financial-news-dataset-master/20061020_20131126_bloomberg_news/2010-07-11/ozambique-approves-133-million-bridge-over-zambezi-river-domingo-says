             The Mozambican government approved a
105 million euro ($133 million) contract to build a bridge over
the Zambezi River, the state-run Domingo newspaper said today,
citing a statement from the group building the structure.  
 Construction of the bridge in central Mozambique will start
“within days” and end in 2014, linking the Benga coal mining
town with the city of Tete, the Maputo-based weekly said.  
 The group will have a 20-year concession to run the bridge
and repair the nearby Samora Machel bridge on the same river,
Domingo said.
