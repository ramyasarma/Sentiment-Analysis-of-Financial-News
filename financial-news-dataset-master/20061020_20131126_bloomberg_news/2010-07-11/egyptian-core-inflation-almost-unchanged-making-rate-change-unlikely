             Egypt’s core inflation was steady in
June, supporting the central bank’s decision to keep interest
rates unchanged at a four-year low.  
 The measure was “almost unchanged” at 6.70 percent
compared with 6.69 percent in the previous month, the Cairo-
based bank said in a statement on its  website  today. The median
estimate of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 6.8
percent. Core inflation excludes the prices of fruits and
vegetables, as well as regulated prices.  
 Headline inflation in urban areas, the measure the central
bank uses to compute its core index, was 10.7 percent in June
compared with 10.5 percent in the previous month, the state
statistics agency said yesterday. The central bank said last
month that while headline inflation was “elevated” because of
high fruit and vegetable prices, it remained subdued enough to
keep interest rates unchanged.  
 “I don’t see the authorities moving any time soon unless
there is a significant spike which is not expected,”  John Sfakianakis , Riyadh-based chief Middle East and North Africa
economist at Credit Agricole CIB, said by e-mail. “The central
bank will continue to be vigilant and maintain rates steady.”  
 The Monetary Policy Committee cut interest rates six times
in 2009 to support economic growth in the most populous Arab
country. The central bank’s key rate, the overnight deposit
rate, is 8.25 percent.
