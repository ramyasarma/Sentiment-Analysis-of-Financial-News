             Gazprom Neft hasn’t changed plans
for its 400-meter (1,300 foot) tower in St. Petersburg, Arabtec
Construction Chief Executive Officer Thomas Barry said today.  
 Arabtec Holding won the 10 billion-dirham ($2.7 billion)
contract to build the complex. Arabtec Construction is a unit of
Arabtec Holding. Gazprom Neft’s skyscraper plan is opposed by
72 percent of residents in the city, a poll published on Oct. 27
showed.
