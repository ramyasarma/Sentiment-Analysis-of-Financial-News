             Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop
 Rafael Furcal  and Chicago White Sox first baseman  Paul Konerko 
were given spots yesterday on Major League Baseball’s All-Star
rosters.  
 Furcal replaces the injured New York Mets’  Jose Reyes  on
the National League’s roster for the 81st All-Star Game on July
13 in Anaheim, California.  
 Reyes strained his already sore left side when he tried to
field a seventh-inning grounder by  Troy Glaus , turned and made
a long throw to first base in yesterday’s 4-0 loss to Atlanta.  
 Konerko will join the American League All-Star team,
replacing  Justin Morneau  of the Minnesota Twins who is still
suffering the effects of a base-running collision.  
 Konerko, who has a .299 batting average with 20 home runs
and 62 runs batted in this season, was selected for his fourth
All-Star game by manager  Joe Girardi.   
 Morneau took a knee to the head from Toronto’s  John McDonald  on July 7 while sliding into second base. He missed
his third straight game yesterday because of concussion-like
symptoms.
