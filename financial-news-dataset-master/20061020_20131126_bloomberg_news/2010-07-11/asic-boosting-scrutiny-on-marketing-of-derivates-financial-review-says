             Australia’s corporate regulator has
increased its scrutiny on the marketing of so-called contracts
for difference and wants better disclosure of risks to help
limit investor losses, the Australian Financial Review reported
citing the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.  
 There is a lack of understanding about the impact of
leveraging, the newspaper reported, citing commissioner Greg
Medcraft.  
 A CFD is a financial instrument that enables investors to
bet on share-price performance, without owning the shares.  
 Among the steps being taken, ASIC will push for better
disclosure of the risks, will target misleading advertising and
will seek suitability tests for investors, the newspaper said.
