             Uruguay striker  Diego Forlan  last
night won the Golden Ball award as best player at the soccer
World Cup after helping his team to reach the semifinals in
South Africa.  
 The Atletico Madrid player got 23.4 percent of the votes
from accredited media at the tournament to take the accolade
ahead of  Wesley Sneijder  of the Netherlands, and Spain’s  David Villa . Sneijder got 21.8 percent of the vote, with Villa
receiving 16.9 percent.  
 Spain won the World Cup with a 1-0 victory over the
Netherlands at Soccer City in Johannesburg. The other players
nominated for the award were Asamoah Gyan of Ghana, Spain’s
 Andres Iniesta , Argentina’s  Lionel Messi , Germany’s  Mesut Oezil 
and Bastian Schweinsteiger,  Arjen Robben  of the Netherlands,
and Xavi of Spain.  
 Germany’s Thomas Mueller won the Golden Boot as top scorer
after finishing tied on 5 goals with Spain’s Villa, Wesley
Sneijder of the Netherlands and Forlan. Mueller took the prize
because he had three assists, compared to one each for the other
candidates.  
 Mueller was also named the best young player of the
monthlong event. That accolade was open to players born on
or after Jan. 1, 1989.
