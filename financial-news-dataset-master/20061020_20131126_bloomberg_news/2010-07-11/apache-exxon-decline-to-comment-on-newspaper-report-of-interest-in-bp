             Exxon Mobil Corp.  declined to
comment on reports the company has received government approval
to explore a bid for  BP Plc .  
 Exxon’s  Alan Jeffers  had no comment on the report today in
the London-based Times newspaper. Max McGahan, a spokesman for
London-based BP, also said he wouldn’t comment.  
 BP is seeking funds to pay for the biggest U.S. oil spill
in history. The company is in talks to sell some assets
including its Alaska oil fields to Houston-based Apache Corp.,
two people familiar with the discussions said. The talks were
first reported in the same story as the Exxon news in the Times.  
 The Times reported that Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, has
been told by the U.S. government it can look at a potential bid
for BP. The newspaper cited oil-industry sources for the
information.  
 BP scrapped its  dividend  and said last month it will sell
some of its assets to pay cleanup costs, fines and legal damages
from the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. The company
has spent more than $3 billion on spill response in the Gulf of
Mexico and agreed to establish a $20 billion fund for damage
claims.  
 Exxon would evaluate any asset sales by BP, Chief Executive
Officer  Rex Tillerson  said on July 8.  
 Cecelia Prewett, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, said she’s not aware of the agency giving Exxon the
permission.  
 “We would need to do a review,” she said in an e-mailed
statement today.
