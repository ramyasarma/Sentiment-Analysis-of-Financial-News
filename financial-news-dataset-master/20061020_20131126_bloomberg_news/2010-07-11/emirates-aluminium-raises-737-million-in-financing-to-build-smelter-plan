             Emirates Aluminium Co. signed
financing agreements with three export credit agencies for about
$737 million for its smelter.  
 The U.S. Export-Import Bank will provide $317 million with
a direct loan, Germany’s Euler Hermes Kreditversicherungs-AG
will provide a $220 million bank-funded term loan facility, and
France’s Coface SA will lend $200 million also in a term loan,
Emirates Aluminium said in a statement received by e-mail today.  
 Each facility has a tenor of about 15 years, and adds to
the company’s existing term loan financing completed in 2007, it
said in the statement.
