             Porsche AG  may price the 918 Spyder,
which soars to 100 kilometers an hour in 3.2 seconds, at 500,000
euros ($630,000), topping the Carrera GT as its costliest model,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the plan.  
 At least 2,000 individuals have put in non-binding
expressions of interest for the supercar, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The 918 Spyder is one of three hybrid models
Porsche presented at the Geneva auto show in March.  
 Demand for luxury cars is returning as Wall Street firms
add jobs for the first time in two years and offer guaranteed
payouts to attract top bankers. While Porsche hasn’t decided
whether and when it will begin production of the model, at that
price the 918 Spyder would top the 453,000-euro Carrera GT.
Fewer than 1,500 of that model were built between 2003 and 2006.  
 “The Spyder will become Porsche’s new supercar showpiece
project,” said  Stefan Bratzel , director of the Center of
Automotive at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch-
Gladbach, Germany. “It unites Porsche’s high-performance
engineering with intelligent drive technology.”  
 Porsche, which is merging with  Volkswagen AG , needs at
least 1,000 sales pledges to approve limited production of the
car, development chief  Wolfgang Duerheimer  said in an April 24
interview. If only half of those who signed up eventually bought
the car, Porsche stands to reap 500 million euros in revenue.  
 500-Horsepower  
 A Porsche spokesman declined to comment on the potential
price tag and said a decision on production of the model will be
made later this year.  
 The two-seater car accelerates to a top speed of 320
kilometers (199 miles) per hour, relying on a 500-horsepower V8
engine and electric drive-systems allowing the vehicle to run up
to 25 kilometers on electric power.  
 The 918 Spyder emits no more than 70 grams of carbon
dioxide per kilometer on fuel consumption of three liters per
100 kilometers, according to Porsche’s  website .  
 Frank Biller , an analyst at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg
in Stuttgart, where Porsche is based, said the 918 Spyder may
enhance the carmaker’s environmental credentials and potentially
help attract customers to the brand which he says builds
“Europe’s worst gas guzzlers.”  
 Lamborghini SpA, another luxury brand owned by Volkswagen,
introduced its Reventon Roadster supercar at the Frankfurt motor
show last September. At 1.1 million euros, the Reventon is the
priciest model Lamborghini has ever made.  
 Ferrari 599 GTO  
 Fiat SpA ’s Ferrari unit charges 320,000 euros for the 599
GTO, which the Italian carmaker calls its “ fastest road-going
model  in our history.”  
 Boosting demand for super-luxury cars, average Wall Street
bonuses jumped 17 percent to $123,000 last year, New York State
Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said Feb. 23. Morgan Stanley and
Citigroup Inc. are among banks that are hiring to replenish
their ranks, while Nomura Holdings Inc. and Jefferies Group Inc.
have been recruiting talent from larger firms in a bid to
increase their standing on Wall Street.  
 In the first six months,  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ’s
Rolls-Royce almost doubled deliveries.  Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-
Benz unit increased sales by 22 percent in the U.S. alone.  
 Porsche is promoting the 918 Spyder at a time when
Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW is seeking to revive the sports-car
manufacturer’s vehicle lineup. Volkswagen last week named its
head of strategy,  Matthias Mueller , as chief executive officer
of Porsche from Oct. 1, replacing  Michael Macht , who will head
production at the parent company.  
 Boxster, Cayenne  
 Volkswagen CEO  Martin Winterkorn  said last week Porsche
will probably add a new line of smaller Boxster roadsters to its
four-model lineup as the manufacturer aims to double sales in
the medium term to 150,000 cars and sport-utility vehicles.  
 A further addition may be a compact SUV, smaller than
Porsche’s best-selling Cayenne model, with production based on
the Q5 model of VW’s Audi division, the people said.  
 Porsche’s deliveries in North America, which includes
Canada and Mexico, fell 18 percent to 15,592 units in the nine
months through April. Sales in the U.S., Porsche’s biggest
single market, slumped 40 percent last fiscal year to 19,024
cars and SUVs.  
 Porsche’s preferred shares  rose  36 cents, or 1 percent, to
37.09 euros in Frankfurt, giving carmaker a market value of 6.5
billion euros. Volkswagen  added  1.1 euros, or 1.5 percent, to
73.22 euros, valuing the company at 33.3 billion euros.  
 Uwe Hueck , Porsche’s works council chief, said July 6 that
building the 918 Spyder at the main Zuffenhausen plant would
help create jobs at the factory where about 5,500 workers are
employed. Hueck is aiming to conclude talks with management over
investment and employment terms at Zuffenhausen by July 22.
