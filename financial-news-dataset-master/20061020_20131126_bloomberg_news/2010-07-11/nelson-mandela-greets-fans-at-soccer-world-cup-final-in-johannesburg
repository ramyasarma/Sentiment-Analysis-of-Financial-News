             Nelson Mandela greeted fans before
today’s soccer World Cup final between Spain and the Netherlands
in Johannesburg.  
 Mandela made a brief appearance at Soccer City after
keeping a low profile during the monthlong tournament, the first
World Cup to be staged in Africa. He played a key role in his
country’s bid to host the 32-nation event and attended the 2004
ceremony at which the decision was announced.  
 Mandela, 91, served for five years as president following
South Africa’s first all-race elections in 1994. While he has
largely retired from public life, he had been scheduled to
appear at the opening match on June 11 before canceling after
his great-granddaughter died in a car crash.
