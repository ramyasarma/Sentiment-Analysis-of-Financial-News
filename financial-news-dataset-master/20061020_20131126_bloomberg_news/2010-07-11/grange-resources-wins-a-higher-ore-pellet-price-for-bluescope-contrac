             Grange Resources Ltd., an Australian
iron ore producer, has agreed to an interim sale price of $150
per dry metric ton for iron ore pellets for the quarter starting
July 1.  
 The interim price is a more than doubling of the previous
benchmark price, Grange said in a statement to the Australian
stock exchange. Grange is holding talks with BlueScope about a
new pricing mechanism for the last two years of the current
contract, it said.
