             China Insurance Regulatory
Commission  said it plans to remove controls on preset interest
rates used in conventional life insurance policies.  
 Insurers will be allowed to set such rates, according to a
 statement  posted on the regulator’s website July 9 seeking
public feedback on the relaxation. “Conventional” life
insurance refers to contracts with premiums and policyholder
benefits already set when they are written.  
 The regulator cut the ceiling on preset interest rates for
all life insurance policies, which insurers use to estimate
future investment yields when pricing contracts, to 2.5 percent
in 1999. The higher the rate is, the lower the premium rate that
policyholders pay.
