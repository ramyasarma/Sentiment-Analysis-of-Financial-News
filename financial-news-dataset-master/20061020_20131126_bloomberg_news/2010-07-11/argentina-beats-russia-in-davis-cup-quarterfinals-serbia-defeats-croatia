             David Nalbandian  won the deciding
singles match against Russia today to put Argentina in the
semifinals of tennis’s Davis Cup, while Serbia reached the last
four for a first time.  
 Nalbandian beat  Mikhail Youzhny  7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3 in
Moscow to give Argentina, twice a runnerup in the last four
years, a 3-2 win in the best-of-five series. Russia, which beat
Argentina in the 2006 final, was on a 17-tie winning streak at
home.  
 Serbia defeated Croatia 4-1 after winning both of today’s
singles matches. France won 5-0 against Spain, which was without
top-ranked  Rafael Nadal . The Czech Republic has an unbeatable 3-
0 lead against Chile.  
 Russia had moved into a 2-2 tie against Argentina after
Nikolay Davydenko won in four sets against Eduardo Schwank in
today’s opening singles match. Nalbandian, who has struggled
this season with injuries, then secured his third win in four
meetings with Youzhny.  
 In Split, Croatia,  Novak Djokovic  beat Marin Cilic, then
Janko Tipsarevic defeated Antonio Veic to set up a semifinal for
Serbia against the Czech Republic.  
 Nine-time champion  France, which will be Argentina’s
semifinal opponent, swept its fixture against Spain with Gilles
Simon and Julien Benneteau providing today’s wins.
