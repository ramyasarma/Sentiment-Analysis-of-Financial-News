             French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
will provide his first detailed response today to media reports,
which he has denied, linking his government to conflicts of
interest after an official inquiry cleared Labor Minister  Eric Woerth  of blocking a tax-evasion probe.  
 Sarkozy, whose poll ratings are at the lowest since he came
to office in 2007, plans to speak to the nation at 8:15 p.m. on
France 2 television. Thirty-two percent of voters say they have
confidence in him, according to a CSA poll published in the
Parisien newspaper three days ago.  
 Woerth faced accusations of conflict of interest from
opposition lawmakers who asked whether he prevented tax
authorities from investigating the affairs of L’Oreal SA heiress
Liliane Bettencourt when he was budget minister. Bettencourt,
France’s richest woman, has also been a donor to Sarkozy’s Union
for a Popular Movement party.  
 “Mr. Eric Woerth, during the period when he was budget
minister, didn’t intervene in the services under his authority
to prevent an inquiry into Mrs. Bettencourt,”  Jean Basseres ,
Chief of the General Financial Inspection office, said in a
 report  published late yesterday.  
 Woerth, who is leading Sarkozy’s effort to overhaul the
pension system, told a Europe 1 radio interviewer today that he
had no intention of quitting and that Sarkozy had shown
confidence in him.
