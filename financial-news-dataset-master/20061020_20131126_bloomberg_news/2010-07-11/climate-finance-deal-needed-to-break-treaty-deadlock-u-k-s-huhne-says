             Developed countries must devise a
way to channel $100 billion a year in climate aid to poorer
nations to secure an international deal to fight global warming,
U.K. Energy Secretary  Chris Huhne  said.  
 “Helping developing countries tackle climate change is
crucial if we are to secure a comprehensive and ambitious
deal,” Huhne said in an e-mailed statement released today by
his office in London.  
 Climate finance is one of the keys to unlocking a wider
global warming pact,  Jake Schmidt , climate policy director for
the New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council, said at
the last round of United Nations treaty talks in Bonn in June.  
 In Copenhagen in December, more than 190 nations failed to
agree on a treaty, though developed nations said they aim to pay
$30 billion in aid over the three years through 2012, ramping
the finance up to $100 million a year by 2020.  
 In the wake of those financial pledges, U.N. Secretary
General  Ban Ki-moon  set up the  High Level Advisory Group  on
Climate Change Financing to advise by November on methods for
raising the cash.  
 Huhne’s comments were made before he meets today in New
York with members of the panel, which includes billionaire
investor  George Soros , Deutsche Bank AG Vice Chairman  Caio Koch- Weser  and Norwegian Prime Minister  Jens Stoltenberg .
