             China’s introduction of a property
tax is certain, the Securities Times reported, citing Qin Hong,
a vice director at the policy research center of the Ministry of
Housing and Urban-Rural Development.  
 The government needs to pick the right time to introduce
the tax, the Shenzhen-based newspaper cited Qin as saying,
without giving a timeframe for the tax.
