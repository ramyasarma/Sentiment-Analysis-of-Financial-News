             China’s stocks  rose, extending the
benchmark index’s biggest weekly gain this year, as developers
and banks advanced on speculation the government will relax
curbs on mortgage lending after property price gains slowed.  
 Poly Real Estate Group Co.  climbed 3.7 percent and
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. added 2.6 percent as
the Southern Metropolis Daily said policy makers may loosen
limitations on third-home loans.  Jiangxi Copper Co.  paced gains
by commodity producers after the nation’s exports surged to a
record last month.  China Life Insurance Co.  and China Pacific
Insurance (Group) Co. tumbled more than 4 percent on a regulator
plan to remove a cap on interest rates on some products.  
 “Most of the data point towards a slowdown in economic
growth, which is fuelling expectations that the government will
ease tightening measures,” said  Wu Kan , a Shanghai-based fund
manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, advanced 19.80, or 0.8 percent, to
close at 2,490.72, the highest since June 28. The  CSI 300 Index 
added 1.1 percent to 2,676.22.  
 The Shanghai Composite climbed 3.7 percent last week, the
most this year, on speculation the government will adopt a
looser monetary policy. The gauge has slumped 24 percent in 2010
on concern government efforts to curb inflation and property
speculation will slow the economy. Adding to losses were plans
by the nation’s biggest banks to raise as much as $54.5 billion
to replenish capital after extending record loans last year.  
 Developers, Banks  
 Poly Real Estate, China’s second-largest developer by
market value, climbed 3.7 percent to 11.84 yuan.  China Vanke Co. ,
the biggest, gained 5.5 percent to 7.64 yuan, the most since May
18. ICBC, the nation’s largest listed lender, added 2.6 percent
to 4.30 yuan.  
 China’s property prices snapped 15 months of gains and bank
lending eased in June. Real-estate prices in 70 cities fell 0.1
percent from the previous month, the statistics bureau said in
Beijing today. New lending of 603 billion yuan ($89 billion) was
the least in three months, the central bank said in a report
yesterday.  
 China may loosen limitations on third-home loans as the
curbs reaped their intended effects on the real estate market,
the Southern Metropolis Daily reported, citing Qin Hong, a
researcher from Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development.  
 Looser Standards  
 Some Chinese banks have eased standards for mortgage
lending, at least on a case-by-case basis, according to Credit
Suisse Group AG in a report today. The brokerage cited its
interviews over the weekend with more than 10 property agents
and bank representatives.  
 Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal,
added 1.2 percent to 25.30 yuan, a fifth day of gains.  Yanzhou
Coal Mining Co. , the listed unit of the fourth-biggest coal
miner, rose 1.3 percent to 17.15 yuan. Pingdingshan Tianan Coal
Mining Co., the listed unit of China’s fifth-largest producer of
the coal, advanced 4.2 percent to 14.35 yuan.  
 Overseas sales gained 43.9 percent last month from a year
ago to $137.4 billion, the General Administration of Customs
said July 10. That compared with the median 38 percent forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey of 24 economists. The trade surplus
more than doubled to $20 billion, the highest level in eight
months, according to the customs.  
 A rebound in China’s overseas shipments last month will
provide “slight support for market sentiment in the very short
term,” according to  Jun Ma , chief China economist at Deutsche
Bank AG, in a note to clients.  
 Insurers Slump  
 China Life, the nation’s biggest insurer, slid 4.5 percent
to 23.55 yuan. China Pacific Insurance, the nation’s third-
largest insurer, retreated 5.8 percent to 21.65 yuan.  
 China Insurance Regulatory Commission said July 9 it plans
to allow insurers to decide the preset interest rates, which
insurers use to estimate future investment yields when pricing
contracts, on “conventional” life insurance policies. The
higher the interest rate is, the cheaper the insurance policies
are for customers.  
 The proposal to remove a cap on interest rates for some
life insurance contracts will narrow the profit margin of
insurers, according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. China
Life and China Pacific are the companies with the biggest
exposure to such policies, according to Shenyin analyst  Robert Hu  in a report today.  
 The following companies were among the most active in
China’s markets. Stock symbols are in brackets after companies’
names.  
      Founder Technology Group Corp.  (600601 CH) rose 3.6 percent
to 4.19 yuan after the company said it raised 1.03 billion yuan
in a rights offer. The company sold 468 million shares at 2.20
yuan each in the rights offer, it said.  
 Joincare Pharmaceutical Group Industry Co.  (600380 CH)
added 1.5 percent to 8.02 yuan after saying its first-half net
income may have surged 77.8 percent from a year earlier.  
      Zhejiang Huafeng Spandex Co.  (002064 CH) climbed 3.1
percent to 9.42 yuan after the company said first-half net
income rose to 178.4 million yuan from 8.48 million yuan, a 21-
fold increase.
