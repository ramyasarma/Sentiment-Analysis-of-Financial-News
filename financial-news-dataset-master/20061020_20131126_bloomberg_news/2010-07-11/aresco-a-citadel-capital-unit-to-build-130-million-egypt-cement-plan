             Asec for Manufacturing and
Industrial Projects, a unit of Asec Holding, said it has signed
a $130 million contract to build a cement plant for Building
Materials Industry Company in southern Egypt.  
 Asec for Manufacturing, also known as Aresco, will provide
all the civil, electrical and mechanical works for the 1.5
million-ton-a-year facility in the governorate of Assiut, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. Aresco will also
provide steel fabrication services and will test and commission
the plant, it said. Citadel Capital has a 49 percent stake in
Asec Holding.  
 “The integration of Aresco’s in-house design and
manufacturing capabilities -- which include its own workshops
and fleet of cranes -- have made the company a strong competitor
in both the cement and industrial sectors,” Tarek Salah, a
managing director at Citadel Capital, said in the statement.  
 Egypt wants to increase cement output by 54 percent to 77
million tons by 2015,  Amr Assal , the head of the country’s
Industrial Development Authority, said in December. Cement
production may increase to 60 million tons in 2011 from the
current level of 50 million tons, he said.  
 Shares of Citadel Capital advanced 2.1 percent to 6.44
Egyptian pounds at the close in Cairo, valuing the company at
4.26 billion pounds ($747.8 million). Citadel Capital is the
biggest publicly traded private equity firm in Egypt, with more
than $8.3 billion in investments.
