             The All China Federation of Trade
Unions met banks including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. to encourage the lenders to set up union chapters for
workers in China and to pay a tax to fund the activities, the
Financial Times said, citing executives familar with the talks.  
 Representatives from UBS AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
were also called into the meetings last month at which they were
told they may be required to pay a 2 percent payroll tax to fund
the labor activities, the report said. Officials at the
union and representatives of the banks declined to comment on
the discussions, the FT said.
