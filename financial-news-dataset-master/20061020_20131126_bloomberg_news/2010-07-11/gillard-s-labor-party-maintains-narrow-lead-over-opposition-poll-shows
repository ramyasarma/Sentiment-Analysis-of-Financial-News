             Australia’s Labor Party has dropped
in a poll since Prime Minister Julia Gillard was installed last
month though the party still maintains a narrow lead over the
opposition, the Age newspaper said, citing an Age/Nielsen poll.  
 Labor would win an election with its primary vote at 39
percent, the newspaper said. A poll taken hours after Gillard
assumed the leadership showed a primary vote lead of 47 percent,
the newspaper said.   
 On a two-party preferred vote Labor would win an election
with 52 percent, it said. Gillard is preferred prime minister
with 56 percent in favor of her, compared with 35 percent for
opposition Liberal leader Tony Abbott, it said.
