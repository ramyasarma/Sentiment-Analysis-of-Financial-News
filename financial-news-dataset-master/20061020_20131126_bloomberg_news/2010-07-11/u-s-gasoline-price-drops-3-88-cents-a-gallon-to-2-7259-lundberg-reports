             The average price of regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations fell to $2.7259 a gallon as
crude oil prices declined and supplies of the motor fuel
increased.  
 Gasoline dropped 3.88 cents in the two weeks ended July 9,
according to a survey of 2,500 filling stations nationwide by
 Trilby Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst in Camarillo,
California. In the same two week period, crude oil fell 3.5
percent and gasoline fell 4.5 percent.  
 “On the supply side we’re flush,” Lundberg said. “Demand
is anemic. If crude prices stay between $70 and $80 and if
there’s no surge in employment, I expect price changes will not
be dramatic in the next few weeks.”  
 Oil prices haven’t settled below $70 since May 25 or above
$80 since May 4.  
 Supplies  of gasoline rose to a six-week high in the week
ended July 2, according to the Energy Department. Inventories
increased 1.32 million barrels to 219.4 million, the biggest
gain in 11 weeks.  
 Gasoline demand , measured by what refiners and blenders
supply to wholesalers, fell 0.1 percent to an average 9.45
million barrels a day. Measured on a  four-week average , demand
was up 2 percent from a year earlier.  
 U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump in the week ended July 2
jumped to a five-week high as drivers filled their tanks for the
Independence Day holiday weekend,  MasterCard Inc.  said in its
July 7 SpendingPulse report. Measured on a four-week average,
fuel consumption slipped 1.7 percent below a year earlier.  
 Cheapest in Jackson  
 Regular gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, rose to
$2.713 a gallon from $2.712 yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  
 On Long Island, regular gasoline averaged $2.89 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.08 a
gallon.  
 The highest price was San Francisco at $3.16 a gallon. The
cheapest place to buy gasoline was Jackson, Mississippi, where a
gallon averaged $2.43, she said.
