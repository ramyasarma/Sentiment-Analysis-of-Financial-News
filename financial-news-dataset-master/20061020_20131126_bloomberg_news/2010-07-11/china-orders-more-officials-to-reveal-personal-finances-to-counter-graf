             China ordered a greater range of
government officials and managers at state-owned companies to
report personal information such as salary and bonus as well as
their children’s professions to counter corruption.  
 The  regulation  published today by the state-run Xinhua News
Agency added non-members of the Chinese Communist Party into the
government’s monitoring system that was last modified in 2006.  
 The rules also put additional requirements for government
officials at and above the deputy department director level and
those at the “middle and higher” management posts of large
state-owned companies to report their salary, as well as other
income generated from giving lectures, writing, consultation and
even from painting.  
 President  Hu Jintao  is taking a tougher stance to fight
corruption that has generated criticism of the government. The
Party said in March that it will step up  efforts  to crack major
corruption cases, especially those with collusion between top
officials and business people.  
 Officials must report emigration details, professions and
job titles of their spouses and children, according to the
rules. The new regulation also added the requirements of
disclosing real estate holdings, investments in stocks,
privately held companies, futures, mutual funds and insurance
products, as well as those of their spouses and children that
are still living with them.  
 Of 340,000 building projects probed since last July,
140,000 were found to have corruption-related “problems,” Wu
Yuliang, secretary general of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, said last month.
