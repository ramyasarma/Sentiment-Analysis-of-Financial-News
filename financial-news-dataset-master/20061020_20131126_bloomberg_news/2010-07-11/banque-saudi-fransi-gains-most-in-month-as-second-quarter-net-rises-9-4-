             Banque Saudi Fransi  rose the most in
almost a month after the Saudi Arabian lender part-owned by
Credit Agricole SA said second-quarter profit rose 9.4 percent
as lending expanded.  
 The shares increased 3.3 percent, the most since June 12,
to 44.5 riyals at 11:39 a.m. in Riyadh.  
 Net income increased to 757 million riyals ($202 million),
from 692 million riyals a year earlier, the bank said in a
statement to the Saudi bourse. That beat the 711.3 million-riyal
estimate of four analysts.
