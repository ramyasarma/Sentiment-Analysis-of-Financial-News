             Japan’s Prime Minister Naoto Kan
said his discussion on the need to consider raising the 5
percent sales tax helped contribute to his party’s losses in
upper house elections.  
 Kan was speaking in Tokyo today as exit polls showed the
ruling Democratic Party of Japan lost ground to the opposition
Liberal Democratic Party and Your Party, a new group formed by a
former LDP minister. Kan also said he plans to stay in office.
