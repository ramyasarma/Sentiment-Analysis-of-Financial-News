             “Despicable Me,” a 3-D animated
comedy, opened at No. 1 in U.S. and Canadian theaters this
weekend, bringing in $54.6 million in ticket sales for Universal
Pictures.  
 “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse” dropped to second place with
$31.7 million for Summit Entertainment LLC,  Hollywood.com Box-
Office  said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  
 Ticket sales for “Despicable Me” benefited from the
higher prices cinemas charge for 3-D movies, following the
success of other animated films that used the technology this
year, including “Shrek Forever After” and “Toy Story 3.”
“Despicable Me” features  Steve Carell  as the voice of Gru, a
wannabe super-villain who adopts three orphan girls as part of
his plot to steal the moon.  
 “These are the kind of numbers you see for a sequel,”
said  Gitesh Pandya , editor of Box Office Guru LLC, of the
stronger-than-expected results.  
 The success of the movie is due to good reviews, strong
marketing and its appeal to family audiences as well as teens
and young adults, he said.  
 “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,” the vampire drama starring
Taylor Lautner,  Robert Pattinson  and  Kristen Stewart , has
brought in $235.4 million in ticket sales since its June 30
debut.  
 ‘Toy Story 3’  
 “Predators,” a science-fiction horror film, opened in
third place for  News Corp.’s  Fox studio, taking in $24.8
million.  Adrien Brody  and Topher Grace star as warriors hunted
by aliens in the jungle.  
 “Toy Story 3” fell to fourth place from third with $21
million for  Walt Disney Co.’s  Pixar studio. The sequel brings
back  Tom Hanks  as the voice of Woody, who leads his toy
companions in an escape from day care. The movie’s ticket sales
have totaled $339.2 million since June 18, closing in on 2003’s
“Finding Nemo,” which holds Pixar’s record for the U.S. and
Canada with $339.7 million, according to  Box Office Mojo .  
 “The Last Airbender,” also in 3-D, dropped to fifth place
from second with $16.6 million for  Viacom Inc.’s  Paramount
Pictures. The fantasy, directed by  M. Night Shyamalan , has made
$99.7 million since its July 1 release, Hollywood.com said.  
 Weekend Sales Up  
 “Inception,” a science-fiction thriller starring  Leonardo DiCaprio , enters theaters next weekend in wide release for Time
Warner Inc.  
 The film, directed by  Christopher Nolan , who also directed
Time Warner’s Batman sage “The Dark Knight,” will “open big
and stay strong,” said Pandya.  
 Weekend sales for the top 12 films rose to $183.9 million
from $134.9 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Year-to-
date receipts total $5.94 billion, up 4.9 percent from $5.66
billion. Attendance has fallen 1.6 percent this year.  
 The following table has figures provided by studios to Los
Angeles-based Hollywood.com. The amounts are based on actual
ticket sales for July 9-11.
