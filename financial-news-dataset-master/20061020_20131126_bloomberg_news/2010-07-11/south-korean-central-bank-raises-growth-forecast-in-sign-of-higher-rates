             The Bank of Korea raised its
economic growth and inflation forecasts for this year, signaling
it may follow last week’s interest-rate increase with more moves.  
 Gross domestic product will expand 5.9 percent in 2010,
more than the 5.2 percent predicted in April, the central bank
said today in Seoul. It trimmed the estimate for next year to
4.5 percent from a previous 4.8 percent.  
 Governor  Kim Choong Soo  on July 9 raised the benchmark
interest rate by a quarter point to 2.25 percent, the first
increase since the global crisis, as a strengthening economy
threatened to stoke inflation. The bank said today  consumer
prices  will rise by 2.8 percent this year, compared with the
previous estimate of 2.6 percent, and 3.4 percent in 2011.  
 “Last week’s rate increase is just the beginning and the
question is when the next moves will come,” said  Lee Sung Kwon ,
an economist at Shinhan Investment Corp. in Seoul who forecasts
borrowing costs to rise to 2.5 percent by the end of the year.
“It won’t hurt the economy much as rates are being normalized
from a super-low level.”  
 The won was little changed at 1,196.60 per dollar at 10:30
a.m. in Seoul, after earlier touching 1,193.75, the strongest
since June 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s
gained 4.4 percent in the past month, the biggest among Asia’s
10 most-used currencies. The Kospi stock index rose 0.4 percent.  
 Goods Exports  
 Goods exports will rise 26.4 percent this year, more than
an 18.6 percent gain estimated in April, today’s report showed.
Overseas shipments, which account for about half of South
Korea’s economy, jumped 32.4 percent in June from a year earlier,
an eighth straight monthly increase.  
 Samsung Electronics Co. , Asia’s biggest maker of
semiconductors, flat screens and mobile phones, last week
reported record earnings last quarter, as a recovery in demand
for computer-memory chips drove up  prices .  
 The government on June 24 boosted this year’s growth
forecast to 5.8 percent from a December projection of 5 percent,
saying the global recovery has spurred exports and local demand.
The  International Monetary Fund  last week raised its forecast
for the country to 5.75 percent from 4.5 percent.  
 The central bank is targeting inflation of between 2
percent and 4 percent on average through 2012. Governor Kim last
week joined policy makers in India, Malaysia and Taiwan in
lifting rates, judging that Asia’s expansion will remain
resilient to Europe’s debt crisis.  
 Private consumption will probably increase 3.9 percent this
year, and corporate investment on facilities will advance 20.9
percent, the Bank of Korea’s estimates showed.  
 South Korea will post a current-account surplus of $21
billion this year, more than the $10.5 billion estimated in
April, the bank said. The surplus is likely to narrow to $11
billion in 2011, it forecast. The nation reported a record
surplus of $42.7 billion last year.
