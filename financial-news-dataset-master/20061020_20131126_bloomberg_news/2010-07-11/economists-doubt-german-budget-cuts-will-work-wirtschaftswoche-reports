             Economists doubt that the German
government will be able to enact all of its planned measures to
slash the budget deficit, Wirtschaftswoche reported, citing a
survey of 87 university economists.  
 Only eight said they’re “convinced” Chancellor  Angela Merkel  can push through the combination of budget cuts and
revenue-raising steps, the magazine said in an e-mailed advance
copy of an article for its July 12 edition.  
 Sixty-eight percent said the financial-market tax sought by
Merkel isn’t realistic, according to the survey by the Cologne-
based IW economic institute, Wirtschaftswoche said.
