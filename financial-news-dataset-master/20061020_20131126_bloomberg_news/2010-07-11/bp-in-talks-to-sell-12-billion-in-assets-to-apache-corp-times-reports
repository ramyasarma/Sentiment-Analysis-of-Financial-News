             BP Plc  is in talks to sell as much
as $12 billion of assets, including a portion of its Prudhoe Bay
operations in Alaska, to Apache Corp., the London-based Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 Apache, with headquarters in Houston, approached BP a few
weeks ago and talks have centered on how the companies would
structure an agreement and what other properties might be
included in a sale, the newspaper said. Exxon Mobil Corp. has
also been told it may review BP’s assets for a possible
purchase, the Times said.  
 “We’ve said we’re going to be divesting about $10 billion
over the next 12 months as a result of the spill, but we have no
comment on specific deals,” BP spokesman  Robert Wine  said today
by telephone. “We don’t comment on market speculation.”
