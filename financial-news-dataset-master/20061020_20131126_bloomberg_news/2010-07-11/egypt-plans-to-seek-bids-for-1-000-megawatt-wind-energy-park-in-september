             Egypt plans to invite bids for the
construction of a 1,000-megawatt wind-energy park in the Gulf of
Suez at an international tender in September, Aktham Abou El-
Ella, a spokesman for the Electricity Ministry, said today.  
 Construction of the facility, which will be located in the
Gabal El-Zeit area, will be tendered on a build-own-operate
basis, Abou El-Ella said in an interview in Cairo.  
 “Ninety percent of the land in Egypt is empty and is
suitable for setting up wind farms,” Abou El-Ella said. “With
solar power, plant costs are very high, and with hydraulic power
reaching its maximum capacity, wind farms remain the best option
for renewable energy in Egypt.”  
 The North African country already can generate 500
megawatts of power through wind projects in the Zaafarana area
in the Gulf of Suez.  
 Egypt, the most populous Arab country, generates around 14
percent of its power needs from renewable sources and plans to
increase that amount to 20 percent by 2020, of which 12 percent
would come from wind power.
