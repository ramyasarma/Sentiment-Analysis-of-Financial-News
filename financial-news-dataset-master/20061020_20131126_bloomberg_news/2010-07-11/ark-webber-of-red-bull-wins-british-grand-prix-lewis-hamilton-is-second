             Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa
clinched a 1-2 finish for Ferrari in today’s German Formula One
Grand Prix at Hockenheim.  
 Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull was third, with McLaren’s
Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button fourth and fifth. It was only
the second win of the season for Alonso and Ferrari.  
 The race was overshadowed by controversy as Massa, after
radio communication from his team, appeared to let Alonso move
into the lead.  
 Hamilton still leads the drivers’ standings, with McLaren
remaining atop the constructors’ table.
