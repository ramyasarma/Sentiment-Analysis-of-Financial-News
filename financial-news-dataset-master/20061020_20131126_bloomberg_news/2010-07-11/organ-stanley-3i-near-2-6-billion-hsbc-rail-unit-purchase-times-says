             Morgan Stanley’s  infrastructure
unit,  3i Infrastructure Plc  and Star Capital are close to buying
U.K. train rolling-stock leasing operations owned by  HSBC
Holdings Plc  for about 1.7 billion pounds ($2.56 billion), the
Sunday Times said, citing people with knowledge of the talks.  
 The group was granted a period of exclusivity, and a deal
may be closed by the end of the month, the newspaper said.
Morgan Stanley and 3i are also favored to buy High Speed One, a
rail line that connects London’s St. Pancras station to the
English Channel tunnel, the Times said.  
 HSBC spokesman  Jezz Farr  in London said the company had no
comment on the report.
