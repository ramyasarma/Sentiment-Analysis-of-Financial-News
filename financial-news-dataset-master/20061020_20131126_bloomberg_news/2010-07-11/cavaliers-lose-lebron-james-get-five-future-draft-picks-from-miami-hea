             The Cleveland Cavaliers got the
rights to five future National Basketball Association draft
picks from the Miami Heat for free-agent LeBron James, General
Manager Chris Grant said.  
 The sign-and-trade deal also gave Cleveland “a very large
trade exception,” which the team can use in trades within a
calendar year, the Cavaliers said on their website. The team
declined to disclose terms of the contract.  
 “This deal provides us with multiple key assets and
additional flexibility as we move forward for both the short
term and beyond,” Grant said in a statement.  
 The Cavaliers have two of Miami’s first-round picks
starting no earlier than 2013 through 2017, the Heat’s 2012
second-round pick from New Orleans and Miami’s future second-
round selection acquired from Oklahoma City. Cleveland also has
the right to swap 2012 first-round picks with the Heat.  
 James , who played his first seven seasons with the
Cavaliers, committed to join the Heat on a national television
show July 8.
