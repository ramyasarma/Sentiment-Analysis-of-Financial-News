             Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak
spoke to Egypt’s head of intelligence Omar Suleiman yesterday to
discuss the possibility of allowing a Libyan boat headed for the
Gaza Strip to dock at El-Arish, an e-mailed statement from his
office said. Barak told Suleiman that all boats headed for the
Hamas-controlled territory must be checked to make sure they are
not carrying weapons, the statement added.
