             Australian Prime Minister Julia
Gillard may be considering calling an election for Aug. 28, the
Australian Financial Review reported, without saying where it
got the information.  
 The proposed date may be put to the Cabinet when it meets
tomorrow, the newspaper said. The Cabinet will also be asked to
consider a new climate change policy focusing on renewable
energy and energy efficiency, the Review said.  
 The climate change strategy will likely propose a series of
consultations to decide on putting a price on carbon, the
newspaper reported. Gillard will shy away from setting a
deadline for a move to carbon pricing, the paper added.
