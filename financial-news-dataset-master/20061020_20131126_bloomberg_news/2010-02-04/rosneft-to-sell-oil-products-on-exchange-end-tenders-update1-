             OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest
refiner, plans to handle all domestic oil products sales through
the St. Petersburg exchange, ending monthly tenders.  
 Rosneft will move to daily sales of products such as  jet
fuel , the Moscow-based company said in a statement. Products
sold will be expanded to include petrochemicals, Rosneft said.  
 The St. Petersburg exchange started operating in 2008 as
the Russian government sought to cut Russia’s dependence on
foreign exchanges for oil pricing. Rosneft currently sells more
than 100,000 tons of products a month on the exchange and
volumes are growing, it said.  
 “The number of participants has been an issue” for the
exchange, Artem Konchin, a Moscow-based oil and gas analyst at
UniCredit SpA, said by phone today. “This could mean buyers
will follow.”  
 Rosneft is currently modernizing refineries including
Tuapse on the  Black Sea . It has also said it may acquire
refining capacity in  Europe .
