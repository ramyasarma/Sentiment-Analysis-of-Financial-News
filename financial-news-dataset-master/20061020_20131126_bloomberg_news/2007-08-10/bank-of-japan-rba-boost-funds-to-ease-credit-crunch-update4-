             The Bank of  Japan  added 1 trillion
yen ($8.5 billion) to the financial system and the  Reserve Bank 
of  Australia  lent the most in more than three years, joining U.S.
and European central banks in responding to a credit crunch.  
 The Japanese central bank's largest provision of funds
since June 29 helped bring the overnight call loan rate to 0.49
percent after it climbed to a four-week high of 0.56 percent,
according to  Tokyo  Tanshi Co. Australia's central bank loaned
A$4.95 billion ($4.2 billion), the most since at least January
2003. Central banks in the  Philippines ,  Indonesia  and South
 Korea  said they are ready to provide more cash if required.  
 ``It's the threat of liquidity drying up that's prompting
the major central banks to make these reserves available,'' said
 Arjuna Mahendran , chief Asia strategist at Credit Suisse Group
in  Singapore . ``All central banks are on standby but Asian
markets don't have very deep exposure to bonds so there is less
of a necessity for them to announce explicit measures as yet.''  
 Europe 's central bank yesterday said it would provide
unlimited cash in response to a sudden demand for capital from
lenders roiled by the subprime mortgage losses. Macquarie Bank
Ltd. and Aozora Bank Ltd. led Asian financial stocks lower after
BNP Paribas SA halted withdrawals from funds that owned subprime,
or higher risk, home loans.  
 Market Conditions  
 ``We added funds to the system while looking at conditions
in the market,'' said Noritaka Fukunaga, a press officer at the
 Bank of Japan .  
 Demand for interbank loans soared this week amid record
trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. About 4.7 trillion yen ($40
billion) in shares changed hands on the TSE first section today,
59 percent more than the three-month daily average. The value of
shares traded yesterday was a record 5.3 trillion yen.  
 Shares of Aozora Bank fell 3.3 percent. The company wrote
off a 4.5 billion yen unrealized loss in mortgage-backed
securities in the first quarter. Shinsei Bank Ltd. said this
week its losses on subprime loans reached $30 million. Nomura
Holdings Inc. cited 31.2 billion yen in such losses in its
first-quarter earnings report.  
 ``Subprime concerns are spreading globally,'' said  Susumu Kato , chief economist at Calyon Securities, one of the 25
primary dealers that are required to bid at auctions.  
 Japan's nine biggest banking groups have more than 1
trillion yen of combined holdings in products backed by U.S.
subprime mortgages, the Nikkei English News reported July 24,
citing a report by Nana Otsuki, an UBS analyst.  
 `Liquidity Crunch'  
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc., which had 50 billion yen in
subprime-related investments, sold almost all of them at the end
of June and suffered losses of ``several hundred million yen,''
said spokeswoman  Masako Shiono .  
 Three-month Tokyo interbank offered rates climbed 1 basis
point to 0.792 percent, the highest since September 1998. The
three-month Australian bank bill swap rate jumped to 6.725
percent today, the highest since October, 1996.  
 The  European Central Bank  yesterday loaned 94.8 billion
euros ($130 billion) after Paris-based BNP Paribas SA halted
withdrawals from three funds because the French bank couldn't
value holdings. The U.S. Federal Reserve added $24 billion in
temporary reserves to the system yesterday, the most since April.  
 ``There's a liquidity crunch going on and the banks are
sitting on their hands as overnight rates are being bid up,''
said Ray Attrill, director of foreign exchange research at
Forecast Ltd. in Sydney.  
 Market Turbulence  
 Shares of Macquarie, the largest Australian securities firm,
plunged 7 percent. Its Macquarie Fortress Investments Ltd. unit,
which had $873 million in two high-yielding funds, said on July
31 it was forced to sell assets to avoid breaching loan
agreements.  
 Turmoil in global credit markets may prompt the Bank of
Japan to delay raising its 0.5 percent overnight rate, the
lowest among major economies. Investors today saw a 36 percent
chance of an increase at the Aug. 23 board meeting, according to
Credit Suisse Group calculations based on the exchange of
interest payments. That's down from as much as 75 percent
yesterday.  
 ``The Bank of Japan will have to carefully assess market
developments and implications on business and consumer
sentiment,'' said  Tomoko Fujii , a senior economist at Bank of
America N.A. in Tokyo. ``We now expect a less than 50 percent
chance of another 25 basis point hike'' on Aug. 23.  
 Yen Advances  
 The Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia Pacific Index
lost 3.2 percent. The yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year bond
fell 6.5 basis points to 1.715 percent. Yields on 10-year  U.S.
Treasuries  fell 4 basis points to 4.73 percent.  
 The Philippine central bank said it will take steps to
``maintain stability.'' The  Bank of Korea  said that the chances
of a ``contagion'' spreading from the U.S. subprime rout is low
after yesterday raising its benchmark  interest rate  to try and
curb lending that's fueling asset bubbles.  
 `` South Korea  is in a different situation to other
countries where they are facing a shortage of liquidity,'' said
Kim In Sup, head of the Bank of Korea's money market operations
team. The rate increase was to ``mop up excess liquidity in the
financial system.''  
 Thailand 's central bank Governor Tarisa Watanagase said the
nation's financial system was ``barely'' affected by credit
market losses caused by subprime loan concerns.  
 The yen gained on speculation widening credit market losses
will prompt investors to trim holdings of riskier assets funded
by loans in Japan. The yen rose to 161.31 per euro in Tokyo from
161.63 yesterday when it climbed 2.2 percent, the most since May
2001. Japan's currency traded at 117.93 per dollar from 118.16.
