             Shares of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp.,
the U.S. steelmaker merging with Esmark Inc., fell the most in
almost two years after auditors expressed concerns about the
company's ability to continue operations.  
 Shares of Wheeling, West Virginia-based Wheeling-Pitt fell
$1.80, or 10 percent, to $16.28 as of 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite  trading , the biggest one-day decline since Nov.
8, 2005. The shares have declined 14 percent in the past year.  
 Wheeling-Pittsburgh said in a statement yesterday that it
may have to break debt agreements and that auditors have
``substantial doubt'' about its ability to continue as a going
concern. The company had a second-quarter loss of $41.6 million,
or $2.71 per share, compared with profit of $9.3 million, or 63
cents, a year earlier.  
 Esmark, a closely held steel distributor based in  Chicago ,
agreed to merge with Wheeling-Pittsburgh in March. James
Bouchard, Wheeling-Pittsburgh's chief executive officer, said an
injection of as much as $200 million of cash after the merger
will improve the company's balance sheet.  
 The price of U.S. steel sheet fell for a fourth month in
July as the  U.S. economy  slowed and demand from manufacturers
declined, according to a July 31 report by Purchasing magazine.  
 Earnings were reduced by an unplanned outage at an electric-arc furnace in April, higher scrap metal costs and ``weaker-than-expected'' market conditions, the company said.
