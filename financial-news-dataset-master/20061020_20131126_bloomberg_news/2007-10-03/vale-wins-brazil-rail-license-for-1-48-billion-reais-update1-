             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce , a mining
company that is Brazil's second-largest rail operator, won the
right to operate a new stretch of the country's North-South
Railway in an auction today, allowing it to transport more
agricultural commodities.  
 Vale, the only bidder in the auction, agreed to pay 1.48
billion reais ($810 million) for a 30-year license to run 720
kilometers (447 miles) of railway, according to the Sao Paulo
stock exchange. The new section is part of a 4.5 billion-real
project to link Brazil's north to its industrialized southeast.  
 Vale, the world's largest iron-ore producer, is playing a
bigger role in transporting agricultural commodities amid rising
global demand. Cargo transported by the North-South Railway will
rise to 8 million metric tons by 2013 from 1.7 million this year.
The route will be used to ship mainly soybeans and corn, said
Eduardo Bartolomeo, executive director of logistics at Vale.  
 ``This is a big bet we're making,'' Bartolomeo said. ``This
region is where growth is happening.''  
 Brazil  is the world's second-largest soybean grower behind
the U.S.  
 Vale shares fell 2.25 reais, or 4.1 percent, to 52.50 reais
as of 10:52 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The stock has gained 94 percent
this year.
