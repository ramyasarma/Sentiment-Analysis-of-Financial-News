             Western Union Co. (WU) , the world's
biggest money-transfer business, said profit rose for the fourth
straight quarter as overseas sales cushioned a U.S. slowdown.  
 Net income  advanced 11 percent to $240.8 million, or 33
cents a share, from $216.3 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier,
the Englewood, Colorado-based company said today in a statement.
The average estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for profit of 34 cents a share.  
 Western Union, which gets more than half its revenue outside
the U.S., has  dropped  30 percent in  New York  trading since its
August peak on concern that the U.S. economic slowdown will
spread overseas. Chief Executive Officer Christina Gold is
adjusting by closing  call centers  in the U.S., saying the company
will save $35 million annually starting next year.  
 ``Growth in Asia, the Middle East and South Asia are the
keys to Western Union revenue growth,'' said Bryan Keane, an
analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, in an Oct. 15 research report.
He rates the firm ``neutral.''  
 Western Union rose $1.17, or 6.1 percent, to $20.38 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. The company
advanced 11 percent in the past year through yesterday, compared
with the 35 percent decline of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.  
 `Slower Growth'  
 Western Union withdrew its previous long-term growth targets
for revenue and earnings per share because of ``slower growth''
in transactions than previous quarters. Western Union also
narrowed its 2008 earnings per share estimate to $1.23 to $1.25,
which includes 6 cents per share of restructuring expenses. The
prior forecast was $1.22 to $1.26. The firm expects to issue 2009
estimates in January.  
 Revenue advanced 20 percent in the  region  with Europe,
 Middle East , Africa and South Asia, fueled by a 51 percent surge
in  India . The U.S. had a 3 percent drop, the slowest decline in
two years.  
 Western Union avoided the mortgage investment woes of No. 2
ranked  MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI) , whose shares plunged more
than 90 percent in the past year, forcing it to raise about $1.5
billion from a group led by Thomas H. Lee Partners LP.  
 Fourteen analysts recommend investors accumulate Western
Union shares, 10 say ``hold'' and none ``sell,'' according to
 Bloomberg data .  
 Western Union controlled 16 percent of the $269 billion
money-transfer market in 2006, compared with 4 percent for
MoneyGram and 2 percent for  Euronet Worldwide Inc. (EEFT) , according to
a presentation posted on Euronet's Web site.
