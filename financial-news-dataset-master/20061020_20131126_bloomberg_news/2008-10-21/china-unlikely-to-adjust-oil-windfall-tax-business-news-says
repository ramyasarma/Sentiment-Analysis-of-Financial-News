             China is unlikely to adjust a
windfall tax on oil companies soon because of tight fiscal
revenue and low  oil prices , China Business News said, citing an
unidentified China National Petroleum Corp. executive.  
 China National, parent of listed  PetroChina Co. (857) , may pay 100
billion yuan ($15 billion) in windfall taxes this year, the
Shanghai-based newspaper  said  today. The company, China's largest
oil producer, is lobbying government for an adjustment, it said.  
 Chinese oil producers have paid a tax on oil sold for more
than $40 a barrel since March 2006. Oil in New York has fallen 49
percent from a record $147.27 a barrel in July.  
 China's fiscal revenue growth slowed to 3.1 percent in
September after rising 10.1 percent in August and 16.5 percent in
July, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday.
