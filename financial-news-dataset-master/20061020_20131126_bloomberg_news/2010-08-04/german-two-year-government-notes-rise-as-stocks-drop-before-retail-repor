             The yield on 10-year German bonds
held near its lowest level in two weeks as stocks fell and a
report showed retail sales growth in the euro region stalled in
June.  
 The yield on the two-year note was also near a two-week low
as the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  declined 0.3 percent, underpinning
demand for the perceived safety of fixed income. Euro-region
retail sales were unchanged in June and the employment rate in
the European Union declined for the first time in seven years in
2009, reports today showed.  
 “Soft data should keep bonds well bid,” said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich.
“The world is preparing itself for a low-growth, low-inflation
environment. I see room for further declines in bond yields.”  
 The yield on 10-year bunds was at 2.60 percent as of 2:10
p.m. in London, and earlier reached 2.58 percent, the lowest
since July 19. The two-year note yield was little changed at
0.73 percent.  
 Bonds trimmed gains after a report showing faster-than-
estimated growth in private payrolls in the U.S. helped assuage
concern that the economic recovery is slowing.  
 Retail sales in the 16-nation euro area recorded no
increase from May as households cut spending in Germany and
France, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today.  
 Another report from the EU’s statistics office showed the
employment rate for people aged 15-64 in the 27-nation bloc rose
from 62.4 percent in 2002 to 65.9 percent in 2008, before
falling to 64.9 percent in 2009.  
 Economic Outlook  
 The 16-nation economy will expand 1 percent this year and
1.2 percent in 2011, the European Central Bank predicted in
June. Inflation, which the bank aims to keep just below 2
percent, will average 1.5 percent this year, it said.  
 All 51 economists in a Bloomberg News survey predict policy
makers will leave the main refinancing rate unchanged at a
record low 1 percent tomorrow to support the economy.  
 German bonds with a maturity of 10 years or longer returned
14.7 percent this year, the most since the euro’s debut in 1999,
indicating investors are concerned Europe’s growth may wane.  
 Bond Spreads  
 The added  yield  investors demand to hold six-year Irish
notes compared with German debt widened by two basis points to
199 basis points as Allied Irish Banks Plc, the nation’s second-
biggest lender by market value, said its first-half net loss
widened to 1.73 billion euros ($2.29 billion).  
 The yield difference between 10-year Spanish bonds and
German bunds widened three basis points to 155 basis points. The
Portuguese-German yield spread increased three basis points to
253 basis points.  
 The Greek-German yield spread widened 13 basis points to
761 basis points before the EU and IMF hold a press conference
on the country’s progress later this week. Officials from the
EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank have been auditing
Greece’s progress in fiscal consolidation since July 26 in the
first official review since the loans were approved on May 2.  
 The bailout was triggered after investor concern about the
deficit led to soaring borrowing costs that pushed Greece to the
brink of default on its 300 billion-euro ($396 billion) debt.
