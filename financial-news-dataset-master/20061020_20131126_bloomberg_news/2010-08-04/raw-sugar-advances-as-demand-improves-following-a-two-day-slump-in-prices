             Raw-sugar futures declined, capping
the biggest weekly drop since late May, on concern that India,
the world’s second-biggest producer, may boost exports as rain
aids its cane crop.  
 India may be able to export about 1 million metric tons in
the year starting in October, Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a
report. India’s monsoon, the main source of irrigation for the
nation’s 235 million farmers, was 16 percent above average last
week, the meteorological department said yesterday.  
 “Global supplies will rise significantly if India’s output
matches market estimates,” said  Marius Sonnen , the president of
Sonnen & Co., a New York-based sugar trader.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery declined 0.05 cent, or 0.3
percent, to close at 18.24 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, after climbing as much as 1.7 percent.
The contract fell 6.8 percent this week, the most since the week
ended May 28. Sonnen said he expects sugar to plunge to 12 cents
by year-end.  
 The Indian Sugar Mills Association said the  crop  will grow
by a third next year to 25 million tons from 18.7 million tons
in the season ending Sept. 30.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, refined-sugar futures for
October delivery fell $5.40, or 1 percent, to $539.80 a metric
ton, to cap its first weekly loss since June.  
 Brazil is the world’s biggest sugar producer.
