             NicOx SA , a French drug developer,
slumped in Paris trading after failing to win U.S. regulatory
approval to introduce its first product.  
 NicOx plunged 60 cents, or 21 percent, to 2.24 euros at the
5:30 p.m. close of trading in Paris, giving the company a market
value of 162.5 million euros ($209.5 million). The decline was
the biggest since a 45 percent drop on May 13, when a U.S.
advisory panel recommended rejecting naproxcinod.  
 The Food and Drug Administration decided to follow the
panel’s advice and turned down the medicine, a painkiller
designed to pose fewer heart risks than current therapies,
including  Pfizer Inc. ’s Celebrex, the company said in a
statement today.  
 The FDA recommended more studies to prove the drug’s safety
for the heart and stomach and to show that the use of nitric
oxide in the composition of the drug provides a clinical
benefit, NicOx said.  
 NicOx sought permission to sell the medicine to relieve the
pain from osteoarthritis. About 20 million Americans have the
ailment, which causes the cartilage that cushions the joints to
erode and bones to rub together painfully, according to the
 National Institutes of Health . Naproxcinod is a modified form of
naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, in
the same family of medicines as Celebrex and  Merck & Co .’s
recalled Vioxx painkiller.
