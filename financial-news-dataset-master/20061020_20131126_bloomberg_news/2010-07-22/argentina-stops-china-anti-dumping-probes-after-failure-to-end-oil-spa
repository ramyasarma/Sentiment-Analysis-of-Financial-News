             Argentina closed probes and set
anti-dumping levies on some Chinese products one week after the
presidents of the two countries failed to end an embargo by the
Asian nation on Argentine soybean oil imports.  
 Argentina will charge a 203 percent levy on a number of
kitchen appliances from China and a $17.60 per kilogram levy on
certain textile products containing more than 85 percent
polyester. The end of investigations into textiles and kitchen
appliances, which started in early 2009, was announced today in
Argentina’s official  gazette .  
 China in April banned Argentine soybean oil imports in
retaliation for anti-dumping probes on products ranging from
elevators to textiles. Argentina is the world’s largest exporter
of soy oil. Until the start of the embargo, the South American
nation supplied about 75 percent of imports by the Asian
country, the world’s biggest consumer of the edible oil.  
 President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  failed to have the
ban lifted during a visit to China last week, when she met
President  Hu Jintao . The two countries agreed to form a
commission to look into the matter.  
 Sales of the oil to China generate an estimated $600
million per year of export tariffs and tax revenue for the
Argentine government.
