             U.S. stock-index futures maintained
gains even after initial jobless claims increased more than
estimated last week.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September climbed 1.2 percent to 1,076.5 at 8:32 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased 98 points,
or 1 percent, to 10,156.  
 Initial jobless claims jumped by 37,000 to 464,000 in the
week ended July 17, exceeding the highest estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, Labor Department figures showed
today in Washington. The survey median projected claims would
climb to 445,000. The number of people receiving unemployment
insurance and those getting extended payments dropped.  
 U.S. stocks fell yesterday, ending two days of gains, after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the economic
outlook remains “unusually uncertain” without offering
additional measures to stimulate growth. His semiannual
testimony concludes today with a 9:30 a.m. hearing before the
House Financial Services Committee in Washington.  
 The S&P 500 has climbed 4.6 percent since July 2 on
optimism about corporate earnings. About 85 percent of S&P 500
companies that have reported results since July 12 beat
analysts’ per-share earnings forecasts, Bloomberg data show.   
 Reports today may show sales of previously owned homes fell
in June for a second month, adding to evidence the market will
slump as the effects of a government tax credit fade. Purchases
dropped 9.9 percent from May to a 5.1 million annual rate,
according to the median of 74 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey. Other reports may show the outlook for economic growth
cooled, with the Conference Board’s index of leading economic
indicators forecast to drop 0.3 percent.
