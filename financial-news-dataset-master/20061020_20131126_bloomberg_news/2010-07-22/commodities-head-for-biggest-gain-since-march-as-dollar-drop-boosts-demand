             Commodity prices surged, heading for
the biggest gain since late March, as a weaker dollar spurred
demand for metals, grains and energy.  
 The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials jumped
2 percent to 266.86 as of 3:45 p.m. in New York. A settlement at
that level would be the largest increase since March 29. Sugar
was the biggest gainer, up 4.8 percent. Crude oil rose the most
since May, and copper touched the highest price in 10 weeks.  
 The  greenback  fell as much as 1.1 percent against a basket
of six currencies, its first loss in four days. Some traders buy
raw materials as the dollar weakens to preserve purchasing
power. Commodities also rose as  equity  markets gained, signaling
an improved economic outlook.  
 “The dollar is going to keep going down, which will be a
big boost for all the commodities,” said  Michael K. Smith , the
president of T&K Futures & Options in Port St. Lucie, Florida.
“Sentiment has gotten a lot more positive, and it’s providing
support.”  
 Before today, the CRB gauge had lost 7.7 percent this year
on concern that the global economic recovery would falter.
Stronger corporate earnings this week signaled growth may be
resilient.  
 “It’s all demand driven,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst
at Transworld Futures in Tampa, Florida. “Companies are doing
well. Demand for commodities is starting to pick up.”
