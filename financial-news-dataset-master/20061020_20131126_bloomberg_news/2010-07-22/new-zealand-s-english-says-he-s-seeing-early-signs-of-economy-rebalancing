             New Zealand’s economy is showing
early signs of rebalancing away from a reliance on spending
toward investment and exports, Finance Minister Bill English
said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The tradables sector expanded 3.4 percent in the nine
months to June 30 while there is evidence that consumers are
being more careful with their spending, English said. More work
is needed to build the momentum in the economy, he said.
