             Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans fell relative to
Chicago futures after Midwest rains increased the yield
potential of crops in the U.S., the biggest world’s producer.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
July shrank to 85 cents to 90 cents a bushel above August
futures from 88 cents to 94 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The corn premium fell to 33 cents to 35
cents above September futures from 35 cents. The  spot  premium
dropped to the lowest level since March 19.  
 “We have big crops on the way this year and that will
encourage people to wait” for supplies from the harvest that
starts next month in the South, said  Bryce Stremming , a
commodity risk consultant for Mid-Co Commodities Inc. in
Bloomington, Illinois. “There was a lot of farmer selling last
week,” increasing supplies available for exporters, he said.  
 Soybean futures for August delivery rose 0.75 cent to
$10.16 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price on July
16 touched $10.27, the highest level for the contract since Jan.
8. Futures have risen 9.1 percent this month.  
 Corn futures for September delivery fell 3.25 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.765 a bushel in Chicago, the third decline this
week. On July 15, the contract touched a four-month high of
$3.9775.  
 The September corn futures closed at a discount of 13.75
cents to the December contract, the highest level since they
began trading in 2008, exchange data show. The widening discount
should encourage increased demand for remaining supplies from
last year’s crop, Stremming said.  
 August soybeans closed at a premium of 25.5 cents to
September futures today, up from 18 cents a week earlier  
 “Now that the basis has broken, there may be increased
demand for corn,” Stremming said. “The soybean harvest is on
the way, and that may slow buying.”
