             China’s northwest Qinghai province
will increase lithium output five times over five years to meet
demand for electric vehicle batteries, the China Daily reported,
citing Liu Shanqing, head of the local Land and Resources
Department.  
 The province plans to increase lithium carbonate production
to 30,000 tons by 2015 from 6,000 tons last year, Liu said.
