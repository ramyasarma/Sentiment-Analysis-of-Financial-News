             Egypt’s New Urban Communities
Authority hired a group of five banks to arrange a sale of
local-currency Eurobonds to raise money for domestic
infrastructure investment.  
 Morgan Stanley ,  Citigroup Inc.  and  HSBC Holdings Plc  are
leading the Egyptian pound-denominated issue while The National
Bank of Egypt and  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE  are
co-leads,  Mohamed Assaad , public debt adviser to Finance
Minister  Youssef Boutros-Ghali , said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “This is the first straight or plain vanilla Eurobond
issued by a government-related enterprise,” Assaad said in a
telephone interview.  
 Egypt has amended its laws to allow quasi-government
agencies to tap domestic and international markets for funds to
finance projects in the most populous Arab nation. Egypt raised
$1.5 billion in April in the country’s first overseas sale of
dollar bonds for nine years.  
 Cairo-based New Urban Communities, which is supervised by
the Housing Ministry, allocates land to develop residential
towns, according to its website.  
 The Finance Ministry will guarantee the authority’s
Eurobonds, which will be issued within eight weeks, according to
Assaad. The size of the sale hasn’t been decided, he said.
