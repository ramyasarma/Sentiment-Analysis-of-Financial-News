             Martin Jol said he’ll stay on as
coach of Ajax, following speculation he was poised to join
Fulham in the English Premier League.  
 “Ajax let me know they didn’t want me to go, and I don’t
think I can bring myself to leave Ajax at this time,” Jol told
the Amsterdam club’s website.  
 There had been media reports that former Tottenham coach
Jol was set to join Fulham as successor to Roy Hodgson, who
switched to Liverpool.
