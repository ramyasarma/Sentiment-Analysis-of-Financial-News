             Negotiators for shipping companies
and locked-out workers at the Port of Montreal are holding talks
on the possibility of reopening the port, spokesmen for both
sides said.  
 “Discussions are very positive,” Michel Murray, an
adviser to the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told
reporters in comments that were broadcast by the RDI television
network. “We are exchanging information for the rapid reopening
of the port and the lifting of the lockout,” Murray said.  
 About 850 longshoremen at the port, Canada’s second-
largest, were locked out July 18 by the  Maritime Employers
Association  in a dispute over wages. The association represents
shipping companies. Discussions today are taking place in
Montreal under the supervision of mediators appointed by
Canada’s federal government.  
 Gilles Corriveau, a spokesman for the employers’ group,
confirmed the nature of the talks.  
 “Everyone realizes the importance of the port,” Corriveau
told reporters in Montreal. “We hope we will reach an agreement
on a back-to-work protocol.”
