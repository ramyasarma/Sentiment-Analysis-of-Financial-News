             The rand weakened, snapping two days
of gains, on speculation the central bank will reduce its
benchmark interest rate today.  
 The currency depreciated as much as 0.7 percent to 7.5752
per dollar and traded at 7.5533 by 11:17 a.m. in Johannesburg,
from a previous close of 7.5225.  
 South African Reserve Bank Governor  Gill Marcus  and her
committee will leave the  benchmark rate  at 6.5 percent on July
22, according to 18 out of 26 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.
Traders are speculating the rate will drop.  
 “The market is pricing in a very good chance of a rate
cut, which is more than the economists are looking for,”  Duncan Howes , a currency trader at Absa Group Ltd. said by phone from
Johannesburg. “If the rate is lowered there may be further rand
weakening.”  
 Inflation  in Africa’s biggest economy has slowed for 14 of
the past 15 months, reaching 4.6 percent in May and giving the
Reserve Bank scope to reduce its key rate by 5.5 percentage
points since December 2008. The bank left the rate unchanged on
May 13 as South Africa’s economy began to recover from last
year’s 1.8 percent contraction.  
 South Africa’s main interest rate compares with benchmark
deposit returns of 0.1 percent in Japan and 0.25 percent in the
U.S., making the rand an attractive purchase for so-called carry
trades. The transactions, which involve borrowing money in
countries with low rates to invest in markets that offer higher
returns, have helped the rand rally almost 28 percent since the
start of last year.  
 Government bonds fell, with the benchmark 13.5 percent
security due September 2015 sliding 14 cents to 124.47. The
yield on the bond increased 3 basis points to 7.64 percent.  
 Money-market futures, used to gauge interest rate
expectations, gained. Forward-rate agreements for  three-month
contracts for cash due in one month  rose 2.3 basis points to
6.35 percent.  
 Marcus will make the interest rate announcement at about 3
p.m. local time.
