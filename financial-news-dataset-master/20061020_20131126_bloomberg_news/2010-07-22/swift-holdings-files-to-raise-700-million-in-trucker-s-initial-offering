             Swift Holdings Corp., the Phoenix-
based trucking company owned by  Jerry Moyes , filed for an
initial public offering to raise as much as $700 million.  
 The  company  will use the proceeds to repay a portion of its
existing senior secured credit facility, according to its filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. Swift didn’t
say how many shares it planned to sell, set a price range or
disclose which U.S. exchange its shares will be listed on. The
amount includes shares that its underwriters may purchase
through an overallotment option.  
 Moyes took Swift private in a $2.5 billion buyout three
years ago after he was ousted as chief executive officer in
2005. Moyes helped found Swift in 1966 with a single truck to
haul steel and took the company public in 1990.  
 He was pushed out after insider-trading allegations and
paid $1.25 million to the SEC in 2005 to settle the case without
admitting or denying wrongdoing. He became dissatisfied with the
way Swift was operated after he left, the company said in
regulatory filings at the time.  
 Morgan Stanley of New York, Bank of America Corp. in
Charlotte, North Carolina, and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo &
Co. are leading the sale for Swift. The company will trade under
the ticker SWFT.
