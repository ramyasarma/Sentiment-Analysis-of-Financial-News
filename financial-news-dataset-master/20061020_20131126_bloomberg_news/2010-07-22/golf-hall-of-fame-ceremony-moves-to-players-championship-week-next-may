             The  World Golf Hall of Fame 
will move this year’s induction ceremony to May 2011 to
kick off the week of the U.S. PGA Tour’s Players
Championship.  
 The move to Monday, May 9, from November 2010 will
“heighten the event’s exposure,” PGA Tour Commissioner
 Tim Finchem  said today in a statement.  
 The Players Championship, golf’s richest tournament,
will begin May 12 at the  TPC at Sawgrass  in Ponte Vedra
Beach, Florida, located about 25 miles from the Hall of
Fame in St. Augustine.  
 South Africans  Ernie Els  and  Retief Goosen  head the
list of 24 nominees for the hall. Other candidates include
Americans  Fred Couples ,  Davis Love III ,  Kenny Perry  and  Jay Haas  and Scotland’s  Colin Montgomerie .
