             Mitsui & Co. , owner of an indirect
stake in the damaged BP Plc-operated oil well in the Gulf of
Mexico, rose in Tokyo trading on speculation its U.S. unit MOEX
Offshore won’t pay for spill costs.  
 Shares of Mitsui gained 2.3 percent to 1,113 yen today, the
most since July 8, beating the 0.6 percent decline in the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  
 MOEX Offshore President Naoki Ishii said in a prepared
testimony that government approvals for BP’s drilling plan were
in place and operations had started when the Mitsui unit
invested in the project. His company had no reason to doubt the
“sufficiency or competency” of the plan, Ishii said.  
 “Ishii’s testimony makes the company’s stance clear that
MOEX Offshore wouldn’t pay for the spill costs and investors
responded to it positively,”  Masayuki Nagano , an analyst at
Deutsche Securities Inc. in Tokyo, said by telephone.  
 Ishii and  Kenneth Feinberg , administrator of a Gulf claims
fund, are scheduled to speak today before the Senate
Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government
Information, Federal Services and International Security.  
 BP operated the project with a 65 percent interest, while
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. owns 25 percent. MOEX Offshore, a unit
of Japan’s Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., holds the remaining 10
percent.
