             Pakistan leads Australia by 130 runs
at lunch on day two of their second Test as the bowlers failed
to pressure the Pakistani batsmen at Headlingley in Leeds.  
 Pakistan was on 218-5 at the break in its first innings
after Australia was all out for 88. Pakistan, which has
benefited from 26 extras including 8 no balls, started the day
leading by 60 runs.  
 Shoaib Malik, on 17, and Kamran Akmal, on 11, were batting
at lunch. Umar Akmal and Umar Amin lost their wickets for 21 and
25, respectively, during the morning.  
 Australia had won the toss and decided to bat, having won
the first match in the two-game series by 150 runs.  
 The matches are being held in England because of security
concerns over staging games in Pakistan. It counts as a home
series for Pakistan.
