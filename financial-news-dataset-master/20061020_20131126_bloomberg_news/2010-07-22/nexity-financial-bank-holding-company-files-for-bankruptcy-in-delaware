             Nexity Financial Corp. , a holding
company for Nexity Bank, filed for bankruptcy protection.  
 The Birmingham, Alabama-based company listed both assets
and debt of as much as $50 million today in Chapter 11 documents
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.  
 Nexity said July 15 it reached an agreement on a
restructuring with holders of 88 percent of its $36 million in
debt. The company said in a statement that it would file a so-
called prepackaged Chapter 11 case to complete the
restructuring.  
 The company hasn’t filed quarterly reports with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission since the quarter ended in
September 2008. Nexity Bank is operating under a cease and
desist order issued by regulators.  
 The case is In re Nexity Financial Corp., 10-12293, U.S.
