             France faces a shortage of power-
generating capacity from 2013 as the expected startup of a
nuclear plant at Flamanville will barely compensate for the
shutdown of outdated fossil-fuel plants, according to grid
operator  Reseau de Transport d’Electricite .  
 French power supply will be “reasonably assured” until
2013 though by 2015 rising demand will create a shortfall of 3
gigawatts of power, RTE said in a report distributed today at a
Paris press conference.  
 “Greater uncertainty is weighing” on the availability of
supply from neighboring countries to meet the future supply
shortfall, the wholly owned unit of Electricite de France SA
said.  
 France, which gets more than three-quarters of its power
from nuclear reactors, has imported increasing amounts of
electricity since 2001 as demand outpaces supply at peak periods
Peak demand reached a record 93,080 megawatts on Feb. 11 during
a cold snap compared with a 2001 high of 79,600 megawatts, RTE
data show.  
 France is expected to close 3,600 megawatts of coal-fired
power plants from 2013 to 2015 along with other heating oil-
powered generators while the country has plans for 4,800
megawatts of gas-fired plants, some of which are complete, the
grid said. EDF is developing a 1,600 megawatt EPR nuclear plant
in Flamanville scheduled to start selling power in 2013.  
 Overall, decisions to invest in new plants need to be made
in the coming months to avoid a shortfall starting in 2013, the
grid said.  
 French power consumption is forecast to reach 506 terawatt
hours in 2015 compared with 476.8 terawatt hours last year, the
report said. Demand from industry will rise about 2.6 percent
this year and 1.4 percent annually through 2015.
