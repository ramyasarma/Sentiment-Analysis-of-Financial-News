             Japanese  stocks  fell for a fifth
straight day, dragging down the Topix index to its lowest level
since November, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
said the U.S. economic outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”  
 Canon Inc. , a camera maker that gets about 80 percent of
its sales outside Japan, sank 0.8 percent. Honda Motor Co.,
which earns about 80 percent of its revenue abroad, declined 0.5
percent. Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s biggest commodities trader,
fell 1.7 percent as crude oil declined. Nintendo Co., the
world’s biggest maker of portable video-game players, sank 1.3
percent after Citigroup Inc. cut its stock rating to “hold.”  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.6 percent to 9,220.88
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix lost 0.5 percent to
825.48, the lowest close since Nov. 27. Two shares declined for
each one that advanced.  
 “People in the market are anxious about the future of the
global economy, making them unwilling to take on risk,” said
 Hisakazu Amano , who helps oversee about $18 billion in Tokyo at
T&D Asset Management Co. “There’s uncertainty in the whole
market because of Europe’s financial issues, concern about the
U.S. economy and the sustainability of growth in China and
emerging countries.”  
 The  Topix  has slumped 17 percent from its high this year on
April 15 as Europe’s debt crisis and China’s steps to curb
property prices fueled concern global economic growth will slow.
That has cut the average price of stocks in the gauge to 16.1
times  estimated earnings , the lowest level since November 2008.  
 Nikkei Approaches Bear  
 The Nikkei has fallen 18.7 percent from an 18-month high on
April 5. Some analysts consider a 20 percent drop from a recent
high as signaling the beginning of a bear market. Twenty-four
companies in the gauge sank to 52-week lows today, and none rose
to a 52-week high.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. In New York yesterday, the index decreased 1.3 percent
after Bernanke’s comments to the Senate Banking Committee. While
Fed officials plan for the exit, “we also recognize that the
economic outlook remains unusually uncertain,” Bernanke said in
testimony to the committee.  
 Canon, the world’s biggest maker of cameras, sank 0.8
percent to 3,330 yen. TDK Corp., the world’s biggest maker of
magnetic heads for disk drives, dropped 2.5 percent to 4,905 yen
and was the second-biggest drag on the Nikkei 225. Honda,
Japan’s No. 2 carmaker, declined 0.5 percent to 2,586 yen.  
 “The Bernanke testimony disappointed people,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in assets in
Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  
 Yen Hurts Exporters  
 Electronics makers were the  biggest drag  on the Topix as
the yen traded near its strongest level in more than seven
months against the dollar, reducing the value of overseas income
at Japanese companies when repatriated.  
 The yen appreciated to as much as 86.44 against the dollar
today in Tokyo from 87.10 at the close of stock trading
yesterday. Against the euro, the yen strengthened to as much as
110.36 from 112.26.  
 “Investors won’t be inclined to buy Japanese shares until
they feel certain the Bank of Japan is taking measures against
the stronger yen,” Ichiyoshi’s Akino said.  
 The yen depreciated on July 20 on speculation the Bank of
Japan will weaken the currency after Dow Jones Newswires
reported the previous day that the central bank may take steps
to ease monetary policy should the yen stay around 85 per dollar.  
 The yen has averaged 90.98 against the dollar in 2010,
putting it on course for its strongest year against the
greenback since currencies began trading freely in 1971,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Nintendo, Mitsui  
 Nintendo, which earns more than 80 percent of its revenue
overseas, was lowered yesterday to “hold” from “buy” at
Citigroup in Tokyo. Also, JPMorgan Chase & Co. today cut its
price target for the maker of game players to 31,000 yen from
37,000 yen, leaving its “overweight” rating unchanged.
Nintendo was the  biggest drag  on Topix.  
 Mitsubishi Corp. , which gets about half its sales from
commodities, slid 1.7 percent to 1,823 yen. Sumitomo Corp.,
Japan’s third-biggest trading company by market value, retreated
3 percent to 891 yen.  
 Crude oil for September delivery fell for a second day
today after dropping 1.3 percent to settle at $76.56 a barrel in
New York yesterday, its biggest decline in seven days.  
 Mitsui & Co., whose unit owns a stake in the BP Plc-
operated oil well that caused the worst oil spill in U.S.
history, rallied 2.3 percent to 1,113 yen. Kyodo News reported
that the subsidiary won’t pay for damages related to the
disaster. Mitsui was down 3 percent before the Kyodo News report.
