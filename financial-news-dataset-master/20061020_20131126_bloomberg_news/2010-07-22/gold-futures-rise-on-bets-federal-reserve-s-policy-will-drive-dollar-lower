             Gold futures rose for the third
straight day on speculation that the Federal Reserve will act to
stimulate U.S. growth, driving the dollar lower and boosting the
appeal of the precious metal as an alternative asset.  
 Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress today that the
central bank is ready to “take further policy actions” should
the U.S. economy and labor market need support. Gold has gained
9.1 percent this year, reaching a record $1,266.50 an ounce on
June 21.  
 “The Fed’s willingness to do anything to stimulate the
economy leads to a weaker dollar,” said  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago.  
 Gold futures for August delivery rose $3.80, or 0.3
percent, to $1,195.60 on the Comex in New York. The metal has
climbed 1.2 percent in three days.  
 The dollar fell as much as 1.1 percent against a basket of
major currencies. The Fed has kept its benchmark lending rate at
zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to spur growth.  
 Gold traditionally moves in tandem with the euro as an
alternative to the dollar. Last month, the metal rose to records
in euros, U.K. pounds and Swiss Francs amid Europe’s sovereign-
debt concerns.  
 “You’ve got gold and the euro coming back to a normal
relationship, for now,” McGhee said.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials rose as
much as 2.2 percent, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed
as much as 2.6 percent.  
 ‘Supporting Uptrend’  
 “The optimism toward the stock market and a host of
commodities is supporting the uptrend in gold,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago.  
 Silver futures for September gained 31.7 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $18.12 an ounce.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery fell 40 cents to
$1,529.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery advanced $4.75, or
1 percent, to $456.90 an ounce.
