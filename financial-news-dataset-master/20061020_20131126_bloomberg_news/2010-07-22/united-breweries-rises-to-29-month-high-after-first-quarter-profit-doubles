             United Breweries Ltd. , owner of
India’s biggest beer brand, rose to a 29-month high after net
profit more than doubled and interest payments fell.  
 The shares surged 20 percent, the maximum permissible  daily
limit , to 281.60 rupees at close of trading in Mumbai. The stock,
the best-performer on the  BSE-500 Index , touched the highest
since Feb. 8, 2008. About 1.98 million shares were traded today,
or 14.2 times the six-month daily average. The Bombay Stock
Exchange’s benchmark  Sensex  Index rose 0.8 percent.  
 “On the one hand you have the earnings going up, and on
the other the debt level coming down, which makes your balance
sheet that much healthier,” said  Arun Kejriwal , the Mumbai-
based director of Kejriwal Research & Investment Services.
“Going forward they could be in a better position.”  
 Net income in the three months to June 30 rose to 761.3
million rupees ($16.1 million) from 355 million rupees a year
earlier, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement to the
Bombay Stock Exchange yesterday. Sales rose 37 percent to 7.76
billion rupees.  
 The brewer, owned by billionaire  Vijay Mallya , paid 134.2
million rupees ($2.85 million) of interest in the quarter,
almost a fifth of its payments in the previous three months.  
 United Breweries’ shares have doubled in the past year as
beer sales jumped 20 percent in the 12 months to March 31. The
company signed a deal with  Heineken NV  in December to brew and
distribute the Dutch beer in the world’s second-most populous
nation.
