             Mexico’s peso strengthened for a
third time this week on better-than-estimated U.S. earnings and
a report that showed home sales dropped less than forecast.  
 The peso rose 0.8 percent to 12.7714 per U.S. dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.8724 yesterday. The currency has
risen 2.5 percent in 2010, the second-best performer among 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind Japan’s yen.  
 “Today’s economic data helps reduce uncertainty about a
double recession,” said  Jaime Ascencio , a fixed income analyst
for Mexico City-based Corporacion Actinver SAB.  
 Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell 5.1 percent in
June, the National Association of Realtors reported today. That
was less than the 9.9 percent drop forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. About 85 percent of companies on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that have reported since July 12
beat analysts’ estimates for earnings, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 “It’s incredible that the peso has followed every tick of
the Dow and the S&P,” said  Julio Ramirez , head trader for
Vector Casa de Bolsa in Mexico City.  
 Ascencio predicted the peso will strengthen past 12.70 per
U.S. dollar tomorrow if European banks show positive results
during planned stress tests by the European Union.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bonds due in 2024 was
little changed at 6.85 percent, erasing an earlier decline,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.05 centavo to 128.70 centavos per peso.
