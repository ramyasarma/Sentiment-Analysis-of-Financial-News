             Italy’s  Fiat  SpA will start making a
new family car, currently labeled the N zero, at its plant in
Serbia, Belgrade-based newspaper  Blic  reported today.  
 The new model will be made in two versions -- with five or
seven seats. The five-seat model will be equivalent to the
Mercedes Benz A class, while the bigger car will correspond to
the Citroen Picasso or Opel Zafira. Fiat plans to invest 800
million euros ($1 billion) in the production of the N zero, 100
million euros more than initially planned, the newspaper said,
citing unnamed sources in the Serbian government.
