             Technip SA , Europe’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, gained in Paris trading after
reporting a growing order backlog as it secured contracts in
Brazil and the North Sea.  
 The shares rose as much as 5 percent and were up 2.35 euros
at 50.82 euros as of 10:48 a.m. in Paris. The shares have risen
2.9 percent this year, valuing the company at 5.5 billion euros
($7 billion).  
 “Our expectations for an improvement in the North Sea have
been confirmed by a pickup” in contracts, Technip said in a
statement today, also seeing “promise” in Brazil. The company
confirmed 2010 financial goals and said there has been “no
adverse impact” so far from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on its
business this year.  
 The company expects oil companies to make final investment
decisions on exploration and production projects at a faster
pace this year. Technip, whose largest competitor in Europe is
Italy’s Saipem SpA, was among oil-service companies that
suffered last year after clients cut investments amid tighter
credit markets and a drop in oil prices from their 2008 high.  
 Technip said  net income  fell 8.7 percent to 106 million
euros ($135.4 million), beating the 103.7 million-euro average 
estimate  of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales fell 14
percent to 1.48 billion euros. It kept a sales forecast of 5.9
billion euros to 6.1 billion euros this year, compared with 6.5
billion euros in 2009 and that the operating margin on its
subsea business will be more than 15 percent.  
 The order backlog grew to 8.26 billion euros at the end of
the June from 8.13 billion euros in March and 6.1 billion euros
a year earlier. The subsea operating margin was 16.9 percent,
compared with 18.8 percent, the company said. The offshore and
onshore margin widened to 7.1 percent from 5.3 percent.  
 “There was a good surprise on the onshore/offshore
margin,” said Bertand Hodee, an analyst at Kepler Capital
Markets in Paris. That measure of profitability may not be
maintained because it was due to three big contracts, he said.
