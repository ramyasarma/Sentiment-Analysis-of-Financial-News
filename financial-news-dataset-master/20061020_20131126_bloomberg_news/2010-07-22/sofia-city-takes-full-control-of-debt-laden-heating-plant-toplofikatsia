             Sofia City Council  agreed to take
full control over the debt-laden Toplofikatsia Sofia AD,
Bulgaria’s biggest steam-heating plant.  
 The council voted today to assume control over the 48
percent it doesn’t already own from the government, Mayor
 Yordanka Fandakova  said at a press briefing in the Balkan
nation’s capital today. The city will hire an international
consultant for an audit and to advise on sale options, she said.  
 The plant consumes one-third of the natural gas imported
from Russia and owes 510 million lev ($335 million) to suppliers
including state-run gas distributor Bulgargaz. The utility is
estimated to report a loss of about 38 million lev this year as
many its customers have fallen behind on their heating bills,
 Georgi Kadiev , a city councilman, said at the same briefing.  
 The plant has 405,000 customers and is Bulgaria’s third-
largest utility after the Kozloduy nuclear plant and the Maritsa
East coal-mining and power-generating complex. It has annual
capacity of 6 million megawatt-hours of heating and 850,000
megawatt-hours of electricity.
