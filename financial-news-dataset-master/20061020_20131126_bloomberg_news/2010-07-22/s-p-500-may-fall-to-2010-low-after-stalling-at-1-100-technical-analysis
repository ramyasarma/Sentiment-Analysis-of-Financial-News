             The Standard and Poor’s 500 Index’s
failure to surpass a key level last week may mean the stock
market will slump to a new low for the year, according to
Strategas Research Partners.  
 The S&P 500  rose to 1,096.48 July 15, failing to maintain a
rally past 1,100 for the third time in three months. After the
past two failed rallies, the index retreated to successively
deeper lows, the research firm said in a note July 20. The
equity benchmark closed at a 2010 nadir of 1,022.58 on July 2.  
 Should the U.S. stock market extend its current decline,
the S&P 500 may slide below that,  Christopher Verrone , lead
technical analyst at New York-based Strategas, said in an
interview. The index has lost 12 percent of its value since
hitting its April high, after dropping 1.3 percent yesterday to
1,069.59.  
 “Right now the hurdle is for the bulls to defend that
1,040 to 1,065 range,” Verrone said. “That will go a long way
toward improving the near-term outlook.”  
 The lack of bullish sentiment in the market may be a good
sign for the S&P and an indication stocks might rebound, Verrone
said. Bearish sentiment among newsletter writers is at its
highest level in 12 months, according to a survey by Investors
Intelligence.  
 “From a contrarian perspective, that’s pretty
supportive,” Verrone said.  
 Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.
