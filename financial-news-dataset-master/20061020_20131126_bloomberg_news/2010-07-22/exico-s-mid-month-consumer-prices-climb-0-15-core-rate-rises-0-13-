             Mexico’s  consumer prices  rose 0.15
percent in the first half of July, signaling an end the
country’s longest period of deflation in at least three decades.  
 Inflation was led by higher costs for perishable foods and
travel packages, the central bank said today on its website.
Economists forecast prices would rise 0.25 percent, according to
the  median estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The report shows there’s no threat to the bank’s inflation
projections and policy makers have room to keep the benchmark
lending rate at 4.5 percent through at least year-end, said
 Sergio Martin , chief economist for Mexico at HSBC Holding Plc.  
 “We’re seeing moderation in economic growth, and inflation
is totally under control,” Martin said, speaking in a telephone
interview from Mexico City.  
 The core measure of consumer prices, which excludes some
food and energy items, rose 0.13 percent in the first half of
July. Economists expected a 0.19 percent increase, according to
the median of 12 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Mexico’s central bank last week kept its  benchmark interest
rate  unchanged for an 11th straight meeting, matching the bank’s
longest pause, after consumer prices declined for the past three
months.  
 Benchmark Rate  
 Banco de Mexico will keep the overnight rate unchanged
until April, when it will raise the rate 0.25 percentage point,
according to a survey of analysts by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex
published July 20. Economists predicted borrowing costs could
rise in March 2011 in Banamex’s previous survey.  
 Three straight months of declining prices through June, the
longest such streak since at least February 1973, pushed the
 annual inflation  rate down to 3.69 percent in June.  
 Mexico’s peso gained 0.9 percent to 12.7554 per U.S. dollar
at 12:13 p.m. New York time. The peso has risen 2.6 percent this
year, the second-best performance against the U.S. dollar among
16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Mexico’s economy grew 7.2 percent in April from a year
earlier, as measured by the global economic indicator. Gross
domestic product grew 4.3 percent in the first three months of
the year from the same period a year earlier.  
 The International Monetary Fund forecasts Mexico’s GDP will
expand 4.5 percent in 2010. Latin America’s second-biggest
economy is recovering from a 6.5 percent contraction last year,
the biggest slump since 1932.  
 Mexican  retail sales  rose 5 percent in May from a year
earlier, the most since April 2008, the statistics agency said
yesterday. Economists had predicted a rise of 3.4 percent,
according to the median estimate of 10 analysts  surveyed by
Bloomberg .
