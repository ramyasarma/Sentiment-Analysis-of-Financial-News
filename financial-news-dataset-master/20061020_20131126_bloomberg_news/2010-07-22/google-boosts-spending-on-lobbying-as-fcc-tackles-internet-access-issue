             Google Inc., which favors
regulations on Internet providers, increased its spending on
lobbying by 50 percent this year as the U.S.  Federal
Communications Commission  took up the issue.  
 Google, based in Mountain View, California, spent $2.7
million on lobbying activities in the first six months of 2010,
compared with $1.8 million during the same period in 2009.  
 The FCC is trying to develop a consensus on ways to allow
the commission to regulate providers such as  Verizon
Communications Inc . and  Comcast Corp . Google participated in
talks led by congressional staff members last month.  
 The commission is seeking comments until Aug. 12 on
adopting so-called net-neutrality rules that would prevent
companies that provide Web access from favoring some sites over
others or limiting subscribers’ traffic. The commission didn’t
say when it might act.  
 Chairman  Julius Genachowski  has proposed that the agency
use the same rules to regulate the Internet that it now uses to
oversee telephone service. Verizon chief executive  Ivan Seidenberg  has said the idea would “cause uncertainly in the
marketplace, create disincentives for investment,” and make the
telecommunications industry less competitive.  
 Genachowski’s efforts followed a U.S. appeals court
decision in April that the FCC didn’t have the authority to
censure Comcast for blocking subscribers using peer-to-peer
software often used to view videos.
