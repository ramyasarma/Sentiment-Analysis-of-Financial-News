             Caterpillar Inc. , the world’s
largest maker of construction equipment, raised its full-year
earnings forecast on higher demand in developing countries for
mining, energy and rail equipment.  
 Full-year earnings will be $3.15 to $3.85 a share, up from
its April forecast of $2.50 to $3.25, the Peoria, Illinois-based
company said in a statement today. The average  estimate  was
$3.27 in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Second-quarter profit
was $1.09 a share, beating the 84-cent estimate.  
 “You’ve got strong growth in India and China that provides
demand for commodities,” Chief Financial Officer  Ed Rapp  said
in an interview. “Most of the mining is happening in the
developing parts of the world.”  
 Caterpillar, led by new Chief Executive Officer  Doug Oberhelman , is investing almost $700 million to make hydraulic
shovels and expand truck output. Machinery sales in North
America gained 43 percent in the quarter, while rising 62
percent in the Asia-Pacific region and more than doubling in
Latin America. China presents the largest single opportunity for
construction machinery, the company said.  
 Caterpillar rose $1.13, or 1.7 percent, to $68 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have
climbed 19 percent this year.  
 Net income  rose 91 percent to $707 million from $371
million a year earlier and sales increased 31 percent to $10.4
billion. Annual sales may be $39 billion to $42 billion, with
the low end raised $1 billion since April, the company said.  
 New Products  
 “The fact that they raised the year by significantly more
than the quarterly beat is something we like to see,”  Stephen Volkmann , an analyst for Jefferies & Co. in New York, said in an
interview. “The key takeaway is that the company beat on
margins, they are raising the forecast on margins. That’s what
was really missing the last cycle.”  
 Oberhelman, 57, who took over as CEO from  Jim Owens  on July
1, is working to increase the range of Caterpillar’s products.
The company said June 1 it agreed to buy locomotive manufacturer
Electro-Motive Diesel for $820 million from Berkshire Partners
LLC and Greenbriar Equity Group LLC to expand its rail and
transit units.  
 “As we look at growth opportunities, we are going to look
inside with opportunities to grow organically and outside,”
Rapp said. “One thing that’s important in the acquisition space
you’ve seen from us in the past is that we stick to our
knitting.”  
 Dollar Impact  
 Sales for Caterpillar’s  machines  business, which makes
excavators and loaders, rose 55 percent to $6.73 billion. Engine
sales rose 2.5 percent to $2.99 billion. Financial-product
revenue fell 4.9 percent to $686 million.  
 Japan’s Komatsu Ltd., Caterpillar’s largest competitor,
this month raised its first-half profit forecast 41 percent and
said it plans to double production this financial year to meet
Chinese and Indonesian demand.  
 “Most of the investment community expected a substantial
beat and raise given what Komatsu and other companies have done
recently,”  Larry De Maria , an analyst for Sterne Agee & Leach
Inc. in New York, said in an interview.  
 Increased concern about the strength of the economic
recovery may make central bankers more wary about tightening
monetary policy, Caterpillar said. The company no longer
predicts policy makers will raise interest rates in the U.S. or
euro zone.  
 The U.S. dollar’s strength had a negative impact on
Caterpillar’s sales forecast and volume improvement is better
than it appears,  Mike DeWalt , head of investor relations, said
on the analyst conference call.
