             Absolute Holdings Ltd. gained the
most in more than five months after the company raised 24.8
million rand ($3.3 million) capital and said it will issue about
8 million shares at 3.10 rand apiece.  
 The South African mining company rallied 70 cents, or 25
percent, to 3.50 rand as of 9:48 a.m. in Johannesburg, the
biggest intraday gain since Feb. 17.
