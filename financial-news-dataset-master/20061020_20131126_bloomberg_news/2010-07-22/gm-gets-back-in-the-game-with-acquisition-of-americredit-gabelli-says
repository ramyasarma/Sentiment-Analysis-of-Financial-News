             General Motors Co.’s purchase of
 AmeriCredit Corp.  will make it easier for the automaker 61
percent owned by the U.S. government to compete with  Ford Motor
Co.  and  Toyota Motor Corp. ,  Mario Gabelli  said.  
 GM agreed to buy AmeriCredit for $3.5 billion to reach more
customers with leases and loans to borrowers with faulty credit
records. The automaker plans to file a prospectus next month and
sell shares in November if market conditions permit, according
to two people familiar with the situation.  
 “They need to get back in the game,” Gabelli, who helps
oversee $28 billion as chairman and chief executive officer at
Gamco Investors Inc. in Rye, New York, said during an interview
on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop.” “They want to go
public. They want to repay the government.”  
 Gabelli said U.S. shares are cheap. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index tumbled 16 percent through July 2 after surging to a
19-month high on April 23. The measure, which has risen 7
percent since then, trades for 15.2  times  reported profit from
the past year. That compares with the average of 16.5 since
1954, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The 68-year-old investor said  Ben S. Bernanke , chairman of
the U.S. Federal Reserve, is taking the right approach in his
public remarks on the economy. Bernanke said yesterday that
central bankers “remain prepared” to act as needed to aid
growth even as they get ready to eventually raise interest rates
from almost zero and shrink a record balance sheet.  
 “He didn’t panic,” Gabelli said, referring to Bernanke’s
testimony to the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. “He’s
basically the commander you want at the throttles.”
