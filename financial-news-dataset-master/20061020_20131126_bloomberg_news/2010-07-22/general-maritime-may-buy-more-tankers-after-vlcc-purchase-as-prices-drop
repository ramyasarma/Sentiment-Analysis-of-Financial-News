             General Maritime Corp. , which just
bought five supertankers, may buy more vessels amid low ship
prices, the company’s chief financial officer said.  
 “We are still in a time frame where asset values are
attractive relative to potential returns,” the CFO,  Jeffrey Pribor , said in a telephone interview. “While we will take the
time to digest this transaction, we will certainly be
opportunistically looking for other assets this year and early
next year.”  
 The New York-based company, the second-largest U.S. owner
of oil tankers after Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., has
various resources to finance acquisitions, Pribor said,
including issuing equity, bonds, or using bank loans.  
 “I will never rule out issuing more stock if there is a
use of proceeds for growth that’s accretive to shareholders,”
Pribor said from New York. “We may not need to do that, but if
it looks wise to issue equity to support another acquisition, we
are sure the market will be receptive.”  
 Prices of five-year-old very-large crude carriers, or
VLCCs, averaged  $92.7 million  in the week ended July 19,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. Prices were 43
percent lower than the record high of $162 million reached in
August 2008, though they have gained 20 percent this year.  
 General Maritime said on June 9 that it was buying five
VLCCs and two Suezmax ships with a total price of about $620
million. The company is planning to put three of the five VLCCs
into the spot market, according to Pribor.  
 Larger Fleet  
 After the acquisition, General Maritime will own a fleet of
38 tankers, including seven VLCCs and 13 Suezmax tankers, with a
total carrying capacity of approximately 6 million deadweight
tons.  
 The company on June 23 completed an offering of 30.6
million common shares at $6.75 per share. The proceeds,
approximately $195.6 million after expenses, will be used to
fund the purchase.  
 VLCC shipping rates  fell 16 percent to $10,737 a day today,
according to the Baltic Exchange. The rate has declined 81
percent from June’s high of $55,242 a day.  
 The rate fell to $8,251 a day on July 12, the lowest level
since Nov. 10, 2009.
