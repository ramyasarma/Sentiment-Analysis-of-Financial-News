             Corn fell for a third time this week
on speculation that rain in the U.S. Midwest will replenish soil
moisture after dry weather threatened to reduce yields.  
 Parts of southern Minnesota and northern Iowa received more
than 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain overnight, data from the
 National Weather Service  show. About 72 percent of the U.S. crop
was in good or excellent  condition  as of July 18, compared with
71 percent a year earlier, the government said  
 “The crop is improving and farmers are talking about
harvesting big yields,” said  Joe Victor , the director of
marketing for Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois. “The crop
development is ahead of normal and the conditions are better
than last year,” when yields were the highest ever, he said.  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 3.25 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.9025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
most-active contract has gained 13 percent since June 29, the
day before the government said that U.S. farmers planted less
this year than they had planned.  
 Earlier, corn jumped as much as 1.8 percent on speculation
that demand from livestock producers would increase after wheat
prices jumped to a 13-month high.  
 The corn and soybean crops in the U.S., the biggest grower
and exporter, may produce above-average yields this year,
according to a survey of five Midwest states by SGS SA released
on July 16.  
 Allendale, a commodity researcher and broker, expects
farmers to harvest 167 bushels of corn an acre this year, up
from a per-acre record 164.7 bushels in 2009 and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s July 9 forecast of 163.5 bushels,
Victor said.  
 “Farmers increased sales on this morning’s rally” because
they are expecting to have ample supplies from the harvest later
this year, Victor said.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
