             Qatar Electricity & Water Co., the
second-largest utility in the Middle East by market
capitalization, announced a second-quarter profit of 314.7
million riyals ($86.5 million), beating analyst estimates.  
 The results for the three months to June 30 showed a 16
percent rise from the 271.8 million riyals that the company
reported a year earlier, according to a  financial statement 
posted on the Qatar Exchange website today. The company didn’t
give a reason for the increase. The result beat the 297 million-
riyal mean estimate of  three analysts.    
 The company is a shareholder in the new 2,000 megawatt
Mesaieed Power Co. plant and the 2,730 megawatt Ras Laffan C
plant, called Ras Girtas, which is scheduled to reach full
capacity in 2011.  
 “The capacity addition from Mesaieed and Ras Girtas will
feed the revenue starting from this year,” said Essam Abd El-
Alim, analyst at Cairo-based Naeem Holding who forecast a
second-quarter profit of 255 million riyals.  
 Qatar Electricity , which is 43 percent government-owned and
operates power and water desalination plants throughout the Gulf
Arab emirate, has benefited from the country’s expanding power
demand.  
 Qatar, which has the world’s third-largest gas reserves,
plans to raise its power generation output to 9,000 megawatts in
the coming years and may export electricity to neighboring
countries, Energy Minister  Abdullah Bin Hamad al-Attiyah  said in
May. Attiyah is also the chairman of Qatar Electricity.  
 Qatar Electricity is also expanding outside of the emirate.
The company has bid to build a plant in Oman, Attiyah said at
the time, and it announced in April it would sign an accord with
Syrian-Qatari Holding Co. to build two electric stations in
Syria.  
 Qatar Electricity, up 3 percent this year,  fell 1.8 percent 
to 103.1 riyals a share on the Qatar Exchange today, its biggest
decline since July 4. The company has  risen 3 percent  this year
compared to a 0.1 percent decline for the  QE Index  of leading
Qatari companies.
