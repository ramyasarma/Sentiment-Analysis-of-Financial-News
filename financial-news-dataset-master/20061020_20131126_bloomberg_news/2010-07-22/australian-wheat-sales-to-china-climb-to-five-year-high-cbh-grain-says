             Australian wheat  exports  to China,
the world’s biggest grains consumer, have advanced to the
highest level in five years as the country replenishes its
inventories,  CBH Group  said.  
 The shipments were probably “slightly” more than 700,000
metric tons since the start of November, said Matthew Rutter,
Head of Trading at CBH Grain, part of the group and Australia’s
largest grain exporter. Wheat sales in bulk were about 200,000
tons in the year ended Oct. 31, according to company data.  
 Wheat futures in Zhengzhou have climbed 10 percent this
year on speculation there may be a supply shortage after cold
hurt crops in the world’s most populous nation. China will offer
5 million tons for sale tomorrow and the government says there
are ample reserves, maintaining grain stockpiles of about 40
percent of consumption.  
 “It’s really just stocking up their stores, I would say,
rather than any shortfall,” Rutter said in an interview in
Perth yesterday. “I would expect they would continue to take
advantage of prices they think are attractive,” he said today
by phone. “They are a hard market to get a sense of what their
future demand will be.”  
 China is also increasing corn  imports , pushing them to the
highest level in 14 years, and selling from inventories to cool
prices that have stoked inflation concerns. Rice production, the
world’s biggest, may drop by 10 percent because of damage from
rains and pests, industry website cngrain.com said July 20. The
country is the world’s largest soybean importer.  
 Output Woes  
 Expectations of grain  price  increases are “comparatively
strong,” according to a Xinhua News Agency interview with an
unidentified official posted on the Agriculture Ministry’s
website July 20. Farm production faces difficulties rarely seen
in previous years, it said.  
 China has sufficient ability to “control” the domestic
wheat market, Chen Mengshan, the ministry’s spokesman and chief
economist, said July 16. Consumption is about 105 million tons a
year and the winter harvest was 108.8 million tons, he said.
That, combined with the spring crop, will push production to
more than 115 million tons, he said at a briefing.  
 The country consumes about 500 million tons of grain a year,
with the government keeping stockpiles equivalent to about 40
percent of demand to safeguard supply, according to  Bao Kexin ,
president of  China Grain Reserves Corp. , in March. Premier  Wen Jiabao  has said the government is seeking to increase production
of grains, oilseeds, cotton and sugar and will continue to
stockpile agricultural commodities.  
 China Imports  
 Australian wheat shipments to China this year are heading
for highest level since 2004-2005, according to CBH Group.  
 China will probably import 1.3 million tons of wheat in
2009-2010, the most since 6.7 million tons in 2004-2005, and
purchases may be 900,000 tons in 2010-2011, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.  
 Wheat for September delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade
dropped 0.3 percent today to $5.8675 a bushel. The most active
contract soared 37 percent since June 9 as lack of rain in
Russia, Kazakhstan and the European Union and floods in Canada
hurt crops.
