             The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said it sued Dell Inc. for failing to disclose
material information to investors and using fraudulent
accounting to make it falsely appear that the company was
consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets and reducing
its operating expenses.  
 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle
the SEC’s charges, the SEC said. The information was disclosed
in an e-mailed statement.
