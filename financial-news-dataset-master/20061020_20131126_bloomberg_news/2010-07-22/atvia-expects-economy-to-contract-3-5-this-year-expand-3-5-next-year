             Latvia’s economy will contract 3.5
percent this year, before growing by the same amount next year,
according to the Baltic nation’s letter of intent with the
 International Monetary Fund .  
 The IMF previously estimated the economy would shrink 4
percent this year. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to
21 percent before falling in 2011, according to the letter,
which was  published  on the Washington-based IMF’s Website today.  
 Unit labor costs in manufacturing have fallen 21 percent
since the end of 2008, when the Baltic country turned to a group
led by the IMF and the European Union for a 7.5 billion- euro
($9.6 billion) loan after its second-biggest bank failed.
Latvia’s program calls for keeping its exchange rate fixed to
the euro while letting wages and prices fall to restore
competitiveness.  
 Consumer prices are expected to decline 2 percent this
year, a slower decline than the previous forecast due to higher
energy and import prices, the letter said.  
 The IMF agreed to transfer about $135.6 million to Latvia
after completing the country’s third review as part of its
contribution to the 7.5 billion-euro loan. The European
Commission, which is financing the largest share of the loan,
agreed on July 20 to release 200 million euros.
