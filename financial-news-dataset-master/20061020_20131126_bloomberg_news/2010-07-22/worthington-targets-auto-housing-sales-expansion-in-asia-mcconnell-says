             Worthington Industries Inc. , a steel
fabricator that gets 91 percent of its  revenue  in the U.S.,
plans to expand in India and China to tap faster growth in auto
and housing markets.  
 “We need to be focused more internationally in these
emerging markets than we have been in the past,”  John P. McConnell , chief executive officer of the Columbus, Ohio-based
company, said today in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in
New York. “I hope that we grow it fairly rapidly.”  
 Worthington already exports to China such steel products as
gas cylinders and precision auto parts, and the company is
exploring joint ventures in the country, McConnell said.  
 Worthington opened a joint-venture plant in India this year
that makes suspended ceiling systems and the company currently
sells steel framing products to mid-rise hotel chains. The
company’s cylinder  unit , which makes containers for pressurized
gases, is looking for expansion opportunities in India and
Brazil, McConnell said.  
 Hot-rolled  steel prices  in the U.S. may continue to fall
from the low $600 per ton level before rising to the high $600
level, McConnell said. The worst is over for domestic steel
markets and the U.S. economy, he said.  
 Weak U.S. housing and construction markets prompted
Worthington to shut about half its 27 metal framing plants, and
only one-third have the potential to re-open as the company
consolidates production to boost profitability, McConnell said.
