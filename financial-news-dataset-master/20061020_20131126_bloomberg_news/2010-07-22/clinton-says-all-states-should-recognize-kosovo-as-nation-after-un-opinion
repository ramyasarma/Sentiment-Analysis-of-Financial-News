             U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton said all states should recognize Kosovo as a nation
after a United Nations court issued an opinion that Kosovo’s
2008 independence declaration was legal.  
 Clinton said Kosovo “is an independent state and its
territory is inviolable.”  
 “We call on all states to move beyond the issue of
Kosovo’s status and engage constructively in support of peace
and stability in the Balkans, and we call on those states that
have not yet done so to recognize Kosovo,” Clinton said in an
e-mailed statement.  
 Russia is among countries that haven’t recognized Kosovo’s
independence.  
 Clinton called on Serbia and Kosovo to work to resolve
their political differences. Kosovo declared its independence
from Serbia.
