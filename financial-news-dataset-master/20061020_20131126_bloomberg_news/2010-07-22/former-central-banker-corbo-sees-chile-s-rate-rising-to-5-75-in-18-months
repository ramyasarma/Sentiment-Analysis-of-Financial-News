             Chile’s benchmark interest rate
probably will return to at least neutral levels of about 5.75
percent in 18 months,  Vittorio Corbo , a former central bank
president, said today in a speech.  
 Central bank policy makers increased the rate by 50 basis
points to 1.5 percent in July, saying in a statement
accompanying their decision they would continue to increase
borrowing costs. The central bank in July 2009 reduced the
benchmark rate to a record low 0.5 percent to help pull the
economy out of its deepest slump in a decade.  
 Chile’s economy is recovering from last year’s recession
and February’s earthquake and is on track to expand 4.5 percent
to 5 percent this year and 6 percent to 7 percent next year,
Corbo said in an interview after his speech in Santiago. The
central bank probably will have to continue raising rates to
prevent the economy from overheating, he said.  
 “The central bank’s work, which it has done well, is to
continue withdrawing the monetary stimulus while taking into
consideration international developments and their impact on the
domestic economy,” Corbo said.  
 The median forecast of 35 economists in a central bank
survey on July 9 was that the rate would rise to 5.5 percent in
December 2011.  
 The peso strengthened for a third day, gaining 0.8 percent
to 519.20 per dollar at 1:52 p.m. New York time from 523.15
yesterday. It has gained 2.6 percent in five days, the best
performance against the dollar among 26 emerging market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
