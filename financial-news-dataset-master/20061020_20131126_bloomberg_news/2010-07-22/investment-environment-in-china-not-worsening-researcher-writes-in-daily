             China’s investment environment for
foreign companies is not worsening, despite “many allegations”
to the contrary, Mei Xinyu, a researcher with the Chinese
Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under
the Ministry of Commerce, said in a commentary in the China
Daily today.  
 Foreign countries must make “reciprocal adjustments” to
their policies and outlook toward China if they want to share in
the benefits of the Asian country’s development, Mei said in the
newspaper.
