sending the contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring
in September up 1 percent at 10 a.m. in London.  
 U.S. stocks fell yesterday after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke said the economic outlook remains “unusually
uncertain” without offering additional measures to stimulate
growth.
