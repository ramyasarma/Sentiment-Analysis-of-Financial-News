             Spanish bonds are “increasingly
rich” when compared with other euro-region peripheral markets,
and investor should favor Italian securities, Citigroup Inc.
said.  
 “Spain has been one of the main beneficiaries of the
improved market sentiment toward peripheral market debt,”
 Steven Mansell , director of interest-rate strategy at Citigroup
in London, wrote in a report today. “We see value in fading the
recent tightening” in Spanish spreads and adopting a long
position on 30-year Italian securities relative to Spanish paper
is an “obvious candidate” to achieve that, he said.  
  Spanish 30-year bonds  yielded 18 basis points more than
similar-maturity Italian securities, as of 12:14 p.m. in London,
down from 76 basis points on June 16, according to Bloomberg
generic prices.
