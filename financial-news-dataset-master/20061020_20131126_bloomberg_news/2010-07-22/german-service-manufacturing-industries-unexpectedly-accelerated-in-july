             Growth in Germany’s manufacturing
and services industries unexpectedly accelerated in July.  
 An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
German services industry rose to 57.3 this month from 54.8 in
June, London-based Markit Economics said today in an initial
estimate. That’s the highest in almost three years, Markit said.
Economists had projected the index would fall to 54.5 in July,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  
 A gauge of German manufacturing rose to 61.2 in July from
58.4 in the prior month, Markit said. Economists had forecast a
decline to 58, the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey showed.
