             STMicroelectronics NV , Europe’s
largest semiconductor maker, posted a profit in the second
quarter as increasing demand for chips helped sales climb 27
percent.  
 Net income was $356 million, compared with a net loss of
$318 million a year earlier, the Geneva-based  company  said in a
statement today after the close of trading in New York.
Excluding items, profit was 18 cents a share, in line with the
average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales  rose
to $2.53 billion.  
 The company’s gross margin, the percentage of revenue
remaining after manufacturing costs, was 38.3 percent, compared
with 26.1 percent a year earlier.  
 Revenue will increase 13 percent to 19 percent in the third
quarter, Chief Executive Officer  Carlo Bozotti  said in the
statement. That equates to as much as $2.71 billion, compared
with an average estimate of $2.63 billion, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 Sales of chips, used in products from mobile phones to
television set-top boxes and washing machines, are picking up
after the global recession cut demand for consumer goods. In
April, Bozotti predicted the company’s market may grow 15
percent to 20 percent this year.  
 Microchips  
 In June, the  Semiconductor Industry Association  and
researcher  Gartner Inc.  raised their forecasts for global sales
of microchips this year to growth of 28 percent and 27 percent,
respectively.  
 ST-Ericsson, a 50-50 joint venture with Ericsson AB that
makes chips used in mobile phones, said in a separate statement
its second-quarter loss narrowed to $139 million from $213
million a year earlier. Clients of ST-Ericsson include  Nokia Oyj 
and  Samsung Electronics Co. , the world’s top two handset makers.  
 On July 13,  Intel Corp. , the world’s biggest chipmaker,
forecast third-quarter sales of about $11.6 billion, topping
analysts’ estimates.  Texas Instruments Inc.  on July 19 said
second-quarter revenue rose 42 percent to $3.5 billion, just
short of estimates.  
 STMicroelectronics’s  sales  to the automotive market
advanced 48 percent, consumer sales climbed 42 percent, telecom
sales retreated 3 percent, and industrial sales increased 43
percent, according to the statement.
