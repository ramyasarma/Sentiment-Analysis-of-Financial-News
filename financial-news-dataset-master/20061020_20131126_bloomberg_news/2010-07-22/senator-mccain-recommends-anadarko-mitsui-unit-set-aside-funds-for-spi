             Senator John McCain urged Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. and a unit of Japan’s Mitsui & Co. to set aside
funds to pay for their share of costs from BP Plc’s record oil
spill in the Gulf of Mexico. McCain, an Arizona republican, made
his comments after Anadarko Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett
and Naoki Ishii of the Mitsui unit told a U.S. Senate
subcommittee that they haven’t earmarked money to pay for the
spill. Hackett said London-based BP, as operator of the well
that blew out on April 20, is paying the goverment’s spill-
related bills. As partners in the well, the companies will sort
out between themselves how spill costs should be allocated, he
said. Anadarko, based near Houston, owns a 25 percet stake in
the well, and BP owns 65 percent. The MOEX Offshore unit of
Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., which is 70 percent owned by Mitsui,
has a 10 percent stake.
