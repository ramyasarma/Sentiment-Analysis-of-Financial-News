             Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd. , the
nation’s biggest electricity transmission company, and the
government secured cabinet approval to sell a 20 percent stake,
worth $1.8 billion, as part of a record sell-off of state assets.  
 The government and the Gurgaon-based company will sell a
combined 841.8 million shares, according to a  statement  today.
Power Grid  shares  rose as much as 3.1 percent, valuing the stake
at 87 billion rupees ($1.8 billion). The sale may take place in
three months, finance director  J. Sridharan  told Bloomberg-UTV.  
 The Indian government plans to raise 400 billion rupees
from share sales in companies including  Coal India Ltd.  and
Steel Authority of India Ltd. in the year ending March 31 to
help pay for social sector programs and reduce its budget
deficit. Power Grid needs to raise money to fund expansion of
its transmission network as utilities add electricity-generation
plants to help reduce blackouts.  
 The company said July 2 it plans to sell a 10 percent stake
and the government will offload a similar holding. India held 86
percent of Power Grid as of March 31, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg.  
 The cabinet approved the stake-sale plan today, Neelam
Kapoor, chief of the government’s Press Information Bureau, told
reporters in New Delhi.  
 Investment Banks  
 Investment banks have to submit proposals tomorrow to
manage the sale, Power Grid said on its website.  
 Citigroup Inc. is ranked first among banks managing share
sales in India for a second consecutive year, after it advised
companies including state-run NMDC Ltd. and NTPC Ltd. to raise
funds, according to Bloomberg data. Kotak Mahindra Capital Co.
is ranked second, followed by UBS AG.  
 Indian companies have raised more than 614 billion rupees
from shares sales this year, putting the market on course to
exceed last year’s 718 billion rupees and 2008’s record 782
billion rupees, the data show.  
 Power Grid  shares  rose 1.7 percent to 101.55 rupees at
12:50 p.m. in Mumbai trading compared with a 0.2 percent decline
in the benchmark  Sensitive Index .  
 The company plans to add 80,000 kilometers (49,720 miles)
of lines in seven years compared with the current network length
of about 77,000 kilometers. Power Grid may spend 1 trillion
rupees to more than double the size of its network,  I.S. Jha ,
director of projects, said May 11.  
 Power Grid will increase spending 23 percent to 129 billion
rupees in the year ending March to add 7,500 kilometers of lines,
Jha said at the time.  
 India plans to expand power generating capacity by 78,000
megawatts in the five years ending March 2012 and by 100,000
megawatts in the following five years to meet demand.
