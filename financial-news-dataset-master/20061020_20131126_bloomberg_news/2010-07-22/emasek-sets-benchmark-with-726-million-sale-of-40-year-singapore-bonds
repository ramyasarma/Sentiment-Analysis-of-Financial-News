             Temasek Holdings Pte , Singapore’s
state investment company, raised S$1 billion ($726 million) from
the longest-dated local-currency bonds as it seeks to develop
the island state’s capital markets.  
 Temasek sold 4.2 percent 40-year notes with help from  DBS
Group Holdings Ltd.  and Standard Chartered Plc, it said in a
statement to the Singapore stock exchange. Before today its
longest-maturity Singapore dollar bonds were the S$300 million
in 4.2 percent securities due 2039 it sold in December,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “When you create a yield curve like this for such a
quality name it creates a curve for other borrowers to benchmark
their deals against,”  Brayan Lai , a Hong Kong-based credit
analyst at Credit Agricole CIB, said in a telephone interview.
“These bonds would effectively open the Singapore dollar
capital markets.”  
 Companies issued $24.9 billion of notes due in 10 years or
more last week, the most since the period ended March 22
according to Bloomberg data, as investors speculate inflation
won’t spur central banks to raise interest rates. Singapore,
which reported an 18.1 percent surge in gross domestic product
in the first half, has used exchange rates rather than interest
rates as its main tool to achieve price stability over the past
three decades.  
 Sterling Sale  
 Temasek, ranked the top Aaa by Moody’s Investors Service
and AAA by Standard & Poor’s, sold the 40-year notes “in
response to enquiries from Singapore-based investors who were
interested in Singapore dollar bonds with tenors longer than 30
years,” Treasury Head  Alyssa Ong  said in the statement.  
 The company sold 700 million pounds ($1.06 billion) of 30-
and 12-year bonds on July 19 in its first sale in the U.K.
currency. The extra yield investors demand to hold the 2022
notes rather than gilts has since fallen 9 basis points to 86
basis points, according to HSBC Holdings Plc prices. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Temasek said in May 2009 that it wanted to establish a
“series of different tenored bonds for a more robust and
nuanced signal over the longer term.” Spokesman Tan Yong Meng
declined to comment on its funding plans today.  
 Temasek’s new bonds will be the longest-dated in
Singapore’s currency, Bloomberg data show. So-called perpetual
notes sold by companies including Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.,
United Overseas Bank Ltd. and DBS don’t have maturity dates.  
 Founded in 1974 to foster development of the island’s banks,
airlines and ports, Temasek owns shares of Singapore’s biggest
bank and its largest telephone company.
