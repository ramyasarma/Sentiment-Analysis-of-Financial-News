             Some of the grandchildren of former
South African President  Nelson Mandela  were held up by two armed
men outside their Johannesburg home, police spokesman Govindsamy
Mariemuthoo said.  
 At about 6 p.m. on July 18, the day of the former leader’s
92nd birthday, Mandela’s family members “were approached by two
armed suspects after going through the security gate,”
Mariemuthoo said in an interview from Johannesburg today. “They
were ordered to lie on the floor. It is alleged that one of the
suspects fired a shot. The driver then fired in return.”  
 Police are investigating the incident in which there were
no injuries and the assailants left after the gunfire,
Mariemuthoo said. The attempted robbery took place in Athol, an
affluent northern suburb of South Africa’s commercial capital.
