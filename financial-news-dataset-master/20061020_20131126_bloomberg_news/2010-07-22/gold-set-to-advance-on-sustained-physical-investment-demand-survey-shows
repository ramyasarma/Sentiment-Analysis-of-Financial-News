             Gold may gain as physical purchases
increase and as investors buy the metal as a means of protecting
wealth, a survey found.  
 Twelve of 27 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 44 percent, said bullion will rise next week.
Seven forecast lower prices and eight were neutral. Gold for
delivery in August was up 0.8 percent for this week at $1,197.40
an ounce at 4:30 p.m. yesterday on the Comex in New York.  
 The metal has dropped 5.5 percent since climbing to a
record $1,266.50 on June 21. Stress-test results on European
banks may be released today as regulators determine whether
banks can survive potential losses on sovereign-debt holdings.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week that the
economic outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”  
 The “bullish longer-term uptrend is still intact and
prices are supported by physical buyers,” said  Bayram Dincer ,
an analyst at LGT Capital Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland.
“Gold also serves the principal motive of long-term wealth
preservation.”  
 The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling that most respondents expect a
decline. The green line shows the gold price. The data shown are
as of July 16.  
 The weekly gold survey that started six years ago has
forecast prices accurately in 183 of 320 weeks, or 57 percent of
the time.  
 This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 12  Bearish : 7  Neutral : 8
