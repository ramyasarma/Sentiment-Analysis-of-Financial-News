             Eli Lilly & Co. , the Indianapolis-
based drugmaker, boosted this year’s earnings  forecast  after
second-quarter sales and profit topped analysts’  estimates  as
revenue grew faster than costs.  
 Earnings, excluding some items, will be $4.50 to $4.65 a
share, Lilly said today in a statement, up from an April
 projection  of as much as $4.55. Second-quarter adjusted earnings
of $1.24 were 14 cents more than the  average  estimate of 16
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Lilly is seeking to increase the speed of drug development
as it faces patent expirations on two top-selling medicines, the
antipsychotic Zyprexa and antidepressant Cymbalta, by 2013.
 Investors’  concern that Lilly won’t be able to make up the lost
revenue with new products pushed the drugmaker’s shares down 11
percent last year, making the stock the worst performer in the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Pharmaceuticals Index .  
 “We expect the stock to trade up as investors focus on the
increase in guidance,” Barclays Capital analyst  Tony Butler 
wrote in a research note today. “The results were above our
expectations due to higher revenues as well as higher gross
margin versus our expectations.”  
 Lilly rose 20 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $35.15 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 Net Income  
 Second-quarter net income rose 16 percent to $1.35 billion,
or $1.22 a share, from $1.16 billion, or $1.06, a year earlier,
the company said.  
 Revenue increased 8.6 percent to $5.75 billion, beating the
$5.56 billion average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Cymbalta and cancer medicine Alimta, Lilly’s second-
and third-best selling products, helped boost revenue with 17
percent and 43 percent increases in sales, respectively.  
 “We’ve got 9 percent revenue growth, more than half of
that coming from volume,” Chief Executive Officer  John Lechleiter  said today in a telephone interview. “We’re
confident enough in where we’re going to end up in the year to
raise our guidance.”  
 The cost of sales rose 8.1 percent to $1.02 billion, while
research and development spending increased 14 percent to $1.19
billion. Marketing, selling and administrative costs were $1.76
billion, up 2.8 percent from the previous year’s second quarter.  
 Gross Margin  
 Gross margin was 82.2 percent of sales, little changed from
a year earlier, Lilly said. Barclays’ Butler had estimated 81.5
percent. Based in New York, he has an “equal weight” rating on
Lilly’s stock.  
 Lechleiter said Lilly is looking for licensing deals and
smaller-scale  acquisitions  that will provide “near- to medium-
term top-line growth.” He declined to provide a size of deals
the company is considering. The drugmaker closed its purchase of
Alnara Pharmaceuticals Inc. yesterday, paying $180 million for
the closely held firm upfront with potential additional payments
of $200 million.  
 Lilly has eight drugs in the third and final stages of
human testing generally required for U.S. approval, including
two medicines for Alzheimer’s disease. Lechleiter said those
medicines could reach the market in 2013.  
 Lilly’s top-seller, Zyprexa, brought in $1.26 billion in
the second quarter, up 5 percent from a year earlier. Cymbalta
drew $867.7 million, while Alimta had revenue of $551.8 million.
Sales of the insulin Humalog rose 5.7 percent to $504.6 million,
and increased 15 percent for the impotence pill Cialis to $418.7
million.  
 Effient, a blood-thinner Lilly introduced in the U.S. in
August, had revenue of $22.9 million. It drew $8.8 million in
the first quarter, “a slower start than we’d anticipated,”
Lechleiter said today.  
 “We remain very bullish on this product,” he said,
citing higher sales and prescriptions in the second quarter.
“We’re going to continue to support it.”
