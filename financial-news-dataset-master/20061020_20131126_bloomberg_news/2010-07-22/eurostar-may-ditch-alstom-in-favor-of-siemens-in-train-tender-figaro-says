              Eurostar Group Ltd. is preparing to
open a tender to replace part of its fleet of trains operating
between Paris and London and is interested in buying trains made
by Siemens AG, Le Figaro reported, citing unidentified people at
Eurostar and at SNCF.  
 A decision to purchase from Siemens would be a blow to
Eurostar’s current supplier Alstom SA, the newspaper said.
