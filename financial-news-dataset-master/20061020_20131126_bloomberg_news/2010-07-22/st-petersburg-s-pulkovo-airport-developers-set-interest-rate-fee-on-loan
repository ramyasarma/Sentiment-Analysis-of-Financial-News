             Banks funding a project to upgrade
and expand Pulkovo airport in St. Petersburg, Russia will
receive interest of 425 basis points to 475 basis points more
than benchmark rates for the 12-year financing, according to two
people with direct knowledge of the deal.  
 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and
the International Finance Corporation said July 19 they arranged
the 200 million euro ($257 million) loan for the public-private
partnership, which was syndicated to eight commercial banks.  
 The project, managed by Northern Capital Gateway Ltd., a
consortium including VTB Capital, Fraport AG and Greece’s
Copelouzos Group, is the first public-private partnership for
Russia’s airport sector to meet international standards,
according to the EBRD.  
 Lenders get an interest margin of 425 basis points during
the first four years of the loan, increasing to 450 basis points
in years five to eight and 475 basis points in the final four
years of the deal, said the people, who declined to be
identified because terms are private.  
 Banks also get a commitment fee of 150 basis points and an
upfront fee of 225 basis points to 280 basis points, depending
on the amount they agreed to lend, one of the people said.  
 UniCredit SpA, Standard Bank Group Ltd., Espirito Santo
Investment Plc, Nordea Bank AB, DZ Bank AG, Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau IPEX-Bank GmbH, Mediobanca SpA and Raiffeisen
Zentralbank Oesterreich AG were the lenders on the deal,
according to the EBRD’s July 19 statement.  
 The financing brings the overall amount raised by the EBRD
and IFC for the Pulkovo project to 370 million euros, the EBRD
said.
