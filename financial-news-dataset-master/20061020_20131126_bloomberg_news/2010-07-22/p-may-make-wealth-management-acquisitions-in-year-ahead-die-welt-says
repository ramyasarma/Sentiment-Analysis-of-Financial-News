             MLP AG Chief Executive Officer  Uwe Schroeder-Wildberg  said the company may seek acquisitions in the
next 12 to 15 months to strengthen the wealth-management
business around its Feri Finance unit,  Die Welt  reported, citing
an interview.  
 While the market environment for MLP remains “difficult,”
cost savings will show in results for the second half of the
year, the newspaper cited Schroeder-Wildberg as saying.
