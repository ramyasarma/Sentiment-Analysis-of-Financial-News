             Denver billionaire  Philip Anschutz 
lost a fight with the Internal Revenue Service over a $143.8
million tax bill for himself and his company for 2000 and 2001.  
 The  U.S. Tax Court  in Washington today found that Anschutz
Co. was required to recognize built-in gains upon entering into
an agreement to sell shares to an investment bank, while also
lending the same shares to the bank.  
 Anschutz filed a petition after the IRS challenged his use
of 13 transactions that he claimed deferred capital gains taxes
related to his company’s merger of  Union Pacific Corp.  and
 Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  in 2000.  
 The transactions being challenged occurred from May 2000 to
April 2001.  
 The case tested a 2003 IRS ruling that pledging shares as
collateral for a so-called variable prepaid forward  contract 
doesn’t amount to a sale of assets for tax purposes.  
 A prepaid forward contract gives an investor an upfront
payment in exchange for delivery of an asset in the future. The
contracts have grown in popularity among corporate executives
looking to lock in stock gains while delaying tax.  
 Robert Rudnick , an attorney for Anschutz, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.
