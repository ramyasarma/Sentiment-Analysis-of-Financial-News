             More Americans than projected filed
applications for unemployment benefits last week, a sign firings
remain elevated even as the economy is expanding.  
 Initial jobless  claims  jumped by 37,000 to 464,000 in the
week ended July 17, exceeding the highest estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, Labor Department figures showed
today in Washington. The survey median projected claims would
climb to 445,000. The number of people receiving unemployment
insurance and those getting extended payments dropped.  
 The figures underscore projections that a lack of jobs will
restrain consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, and
lead to slower growth in the second half of the year. It will
probably take a “significant amount of time” to restore the
almost 8.5 million jobs lost in 2008 and 2009, Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress yesterday.  
 “Underlying demand for labor is fairly sluggish,” said
Omair Sharif, an economist at RBS Securities in Stamford,
Connecticut, who had forecast claims would rise to 460,000. “If
that continues, it will have an impact on wages and salaries and
clearly have some negative implications for consumer spending.”  
 Stocks held gains after the report and Treasuries remained
lower. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were up 1.2
percent at 8:47 a.m. in New York, and the yield on 10-year notes
was 2.91 percent compared with 2.88 percent late yesterday.  
 Retooling  
 The rebound in part reflects the unwinding of decreases in
the prior two weeks as fewer factories closed for mid-year
retooling than the government estimated. The influence of the
manufacturing closures will probably take another week or two to
wash out of the numbers, a Labor Department spokesman said.  
 The forecast was based on the  median  projection of 42
economists surveyed. Estimates ranged from 420,000 to 460,000.
The Labor Department revised the prior week’s figure to 427,000
from a previously estimated 429,000.  
 The  four-week moving  average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly figures, climbed to 456,000 last week from 454,750,
today’s report showed.  
 The number of people  continuing  to receive jobless benefits
dropped by 223,000 in the week ended July 10 to 4.49 million.
The figure does not include the number of Americans receiving
extended benefits under federal programs.  
 Those who’ve used up traditional benefits and are now
collecting  emergency  and extended payments decreased by about
368,000 to 3.93 million in the week ended July 3 after Congress
failed to pass legislation extending the assistance.  
 Extended Benefits  
 The Senate yesterday approved an extension of unemployment
insurance that restores aid to 2.5 million people who lost their
benefits. The legislation now goes to the House, where a vote is
scheduled today. House approval would send the measure to
President  Barack Obama  for his signature.  
 The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 3.5 percent in
the week ended July 10 from 3.7 percent in the prior week.  
 Thirty-four states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while 19 reported a decline. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  
 Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates. That relationship has broken down in
recent months as some companies continue to cut staff, while
others expand, pointing to an uneven recovery.  
 Private Jobs  
 Today’s report reflects jobless applications for the week
the Labor Department will survey employers to tabulate July
payrolls. In June, private employers added fewer workers than
projected by economists, while overall payrolls fell, reflecting
a drop in federal census workers.  
 It may take years to recoup the loss of jobs during the
recession that began in December 2007, economists said. The
unemployment rate, which reached a 26-year high of 10.1 percent
in October 2009, will end 2010 at 9.5 percent, the same as in
June, according to this month’s Bloomberg survey.  
 Bernanke yesterday said central bankers “remain prepared”
to act as needed to aid growth even as they get ready to
eventually raise interest rates from almost zero and shrink a
record balance sheet.  
 Companies announcing job reductions in July include New
Brunswick, New Jersey-based  Johnson & Johnson . The health-
products company, under U.S. congressional investigation for a
recall of children’s medicines, said it’ll reorganize the plant
where the withdrawn drugs were made and cut 300 positions.  
 Workers at the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, manufacturing
plant who lose their jobs will continue to get regular pay and
benefits through at least mid-September, then get a severance
package based on the number of years they worked, J&J said.
