             Crude oil traded near an 11-week
high after rising on optimism fuel demand will increase amid
improved prospects for an economic recovery.  
 Oil surged 3.6 percent yesterday as stocks rallied after
EBay Inc. and Caterpillar Inc. earnings beat estimates and
growth accelerated in European manufacturing and services. Asian
equities rose. Prices also gained as the dollar dropped against
the euro, bolstering the appeal of commodities.  
 “Investors believe the global marketplace will make it out
of the funk we are currently in and the markets will trade
higher,” said  Mike Sander , an investment adviser at Sander
Capital Advisors in Seattle. “The combination of an up-day in
equities and a down-day in the dollar tends to boost the price
of oil.”  
 Crude for September delivery was at $79.22 a barrel, down 8
cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 9:04 a.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract rose $2.74
to $79.30, the highest settlement since May 5 and biggest
increase since May 27.  
 Futures are up 18 percent from a year ago. Oil is poised
for a 4.3 percent gain for the week.  
 A  composite index  based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers increased to 56.7 from 56 in June, London-based Markit
Economics said yesterday. Economists had projected a drop to
55.5, according to the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  
 Members of the European Union accounted for 17 percent of
global oil demand in 2009, according to BP Plc, which publishes
its BP Statistical Review of World Energy each June.  
 Tropical Storm  
 Tropical Storm Bonnie has formed south of the Bahamas and
is on a on a track to take it across Florida and into the oil-
fouled waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane
Center said.  
 The Gulf accounts for about 31 percent of U.S. oil output
and 10 percent of its natural-gas production, according to the
Energy Department.  
 The dollar tumbled as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said unemployment is “the most important” problem
facing the U.S. and the Fed has “pushed monetary stimulation to
the highest point in American history.” Bernanke was speaking
to the House Financial Services Committee in the second day of
semiannual congressional testimony on monetary policy.  
 The U.S. currency traded little changed at $1.2892 per euro
at 9:11 a.m. Singapore time, from $1.2893 yesterday.  
 The U.S. Energy Department said on July 21 that U.S. crude
stockpiles grew by 360,000 barrels last week. Gasoline
inventories climbed 1.12 million barrels to 222.2 million
barrels last week, the highest level since April.  
 Brent crude oil for September settlement traded at $77.78 a
barrel, down 4 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange at 9:14 a.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract
rose $2.45, or 3.3 percent, to $77.82, the highest close since
June 25.
