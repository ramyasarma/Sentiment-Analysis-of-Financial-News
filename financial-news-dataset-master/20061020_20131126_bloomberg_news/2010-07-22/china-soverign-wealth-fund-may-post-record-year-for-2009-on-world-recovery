             China’s sovereign wealth fund is set
to post its best yearly gain in 2009 after stepping up
investments in commodities to ride a rebound in global markets.  
 China Investment Corp.  is likely to report a return on its
global portfolio “well over 10 percent” in its upcoming annual
statement, said  Rachel Ziemba , London-based senior analyst at
Roubini Global Economics. The $300 billion fund had a 2.1
percent loss on its global assets in 2008, after chalking up a
0.2 percent return in its starting year of 2007 when the value
of a $3 billion investment in  Blackstone Group LP  plunged.  
 Chairman  Lou Jiwei  pumped nearly $10 billion into
commodity-related companies such as Canada’s  Teck Resources Ltd. 
in the second half to benefit from the global economic recovery.
That compared with $4.8 billion in new investments across all
industries for the entire 2008.  
 “2009 results should be good because commodities staged a
strong rally,” said  Francis Lun , general manager at Fulbright
Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. “CIC was very timid, which
actually helped it to avoid the financial tsunami” in 2008.  
 Temasek Holdings Pte , Singapore’s state investment firm,
this month said assets climbed 43 percent to S$186 billion ($135
billion) in the year to March 31. Globally, sovereign fund
assets climbed 9 percent in 2009 from a year earlier to $3.5
trillion, London-based research firm Preqin Ltd. said in March.  
 CIC reported its 2008 results on Aug. 7, 2009.  
 Teck Resources, AES  
 CIC is asking the government for more funds to invest,
Executive Vice President  Jesse Wang  told a conference in San
Francisco on June 9, with cash holdings having dropped to 8.7
percent of its global portfolio from 87.4 percent at the start
of 2009.  
 In July last year, CIC bought 17.2 percent of Teck Resources,
Canada’s largest base-metals producer, for $1.5 billion. It
acquired an 11 percent stake in a unit of Kazakhstan’s state-run
energy company in late September, two weeks before purchasing 45
percent of Nobel Oil Group of Russia. In November, it announced
investments in U.S. power producer AES Corp. and GCL-Poly Energy
Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest polysilicon producer.  
 AES  closed at $13.31 in New York trading Dec. 31, giving
CIC a paper profit of 7 percent, while  GCL-Poly  shares rose 30
percent from the fund’s HK$1.79 purchase price on Nov. 19 to the
end of last year.  
 The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials
advanced 23 percent in 2009, reversing a 36 percent drop the
previous year.  
 Morgan Stanley , which is about 10 percent owned by CIC,
surged 85 percent last year, while  Blackstone  doubled, helping
China’s state fund recoup some earlier losses.  
 A record $1.4 trillion credit expansion by Chinese banks
boosted state lenders’ profits last year, contributing in turn
to CIC’s total earnings via unit Central Huijin Investment Co.  
 Bank Stakes  
 The  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
most profitable lender that was 35.4 percent owned by Huijin,
had a 20.2 percent return on equity last year.  Bank of China
Ltd. , 67.5 percent held by the CIC investment arm, had 81
billion yuan in profit.  
 “2010 will be a tougher year for CIC given that many risky
assets have suffered,” Ziemba said. “CIC’s pace of purchases
seems to have slowed down in the first half of 2010, as it has
spent a greater portion of its liquid funds, having deployed
much of the international portfolio in 2009.”  
 CIC had 24.68 percent of its global portfolio in public
equity markets, Wang said at the Asia Banking and Finance
Conference last month. The sovereign wealth fund holds about 18
percent of its investments in fixed-income securities and 8.8
percent in inflation-linked products, he said. Almost 7 percent
is held in private-equity funds.  
 Rally Stalls  
 The  MSCI World Index , which surged 27 percent in 2009, has
dropped 5 percent this year as the European debt crisis and
China’s efforts to curb asset bubbles threatened the global
recovery.  PT Bumi Resources , Indonesia’s biggest coal producer
in which CIC made its largest investment announced in 2009, has
fallen nearly 30 percent.  
 Excluding investments held in the Huijin unit, CIC isn’t
allowed to invest in China. The government may move control of
Huijin to a new agency it plans to set up to hold stakes in the
nation’s state-owned financial companies, the official China
Daily reported July 7.  
 That may result in more volatility for CIC as it would make
the international portfolio the only assets it manages, Ziemba
said.  
 Still, “it will reduce concerns from international
regulators that CIC is investing on behalf and in conjunction
with its bank subsidiaries,” she said. “That might reduce
concerns about stakes it takes abroad.”
