             Ferrexpo Plc , a mining company with
operations in Ukraine, canceled a planned $500 million bond sale
to refinance debt because costs were too high.  
 “We’re not going forward with it because we don’t think
the price is right,” a Ferrexpo spokesman who declined to be
identified because of company policy said today by telephone.
“We don’t immediately need finance and we have cheaper
financing options available.”  
 Ferrexpo is looking for cash to fund new grinding
facilities and a second flotation plant as it seeks to produce
pellets with a higher iron-ore content. The London-based company
is also aiming to increase output at the  Lavrikovskoe deposit  by
extending the existing pit there.  
 Cash flow has increased following gains in iron ore prices,
the spokesman said. “We’ll continue to monitor the debt market
and when we believe that the market conditions are right we’ll
go back into it,” he said.  
 Ferrexpo hired JPMorgan Cazenove and UBS AG to arrange
meetings with bond investors, a person with knowledge of the
roadshow said June 30.
