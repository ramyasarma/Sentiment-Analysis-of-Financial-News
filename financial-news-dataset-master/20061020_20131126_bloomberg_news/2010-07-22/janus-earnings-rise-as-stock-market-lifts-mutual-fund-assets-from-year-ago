             Janus Capital Group Inc. , owner of
the Janus, Intech and Perkins funds, said second-quarter
earnings rose 91 percent as stock-market gains boosted assets
invested for clients.  
 Net income increased to $30.2 million, or 17 cents a share,
from $15.8 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier, the Denver-
based company said in a statement today. Results beat the 14-
cent average estimate of 16 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  
 The  MSCI AC World Index  of stocks climbed 9.5 percent in
the year ended June 30, lifting the amount of money Janus
oversees for clients and the fees it generates. More than 90
percent of the company’s mutual-fund assets are in equities.
Funds deposits may slow after the world index gave up some of
its gains in the second quarter.  
 “Flows pretty broadly were better than expected,”  Mark Lane , an analyst at William Blair & Co. in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “I was surprised they have held up as well
as they did given the market’s performance in May and June.”
Lane had expected Janus to earn 14 cents a share.  
 Revenue rose 25 percent to $249.3 million, driven by a 30
percent jump in investment-management fees to $207.8 million.
Expenses increased 23 percent to $187.9 million, as employee
compensation and benefits, including long-term incentives, rose
25 percent to $99.9 million.  
 Yearly Increase  
 Assets under management increased from a year ago by 11
percent to $147.2 billion, as the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
rose 14 percent including dividends. During the second quarter,
assets fell 11 percent with net withdrawals of $1.3 billion.  
 Investors took out $1.5 billion from the firm’s Intech
unit, which uses mathematical models to select investments, and
$1 billion from traditional equity funds in the three months
ended June 30. Intech had $4.3 billion in net withdrawals in the
first quarter of 2010.  
 Bond funds had $1.2 billion in net deposits while money-
market assets were unchanged in the second quarter.  
 Janus reported earnings before the start of regular U.S.
trading. Its stock has fallen 30 percent this year, compared
with the 12 percent decline by Standard & Poor’s  index  of 15
asset managers and custody banks.  
 (Janus will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. New York
time. The call-in number is +1-877-301-7574 in the U.S. and
Canada and +1-706-643-3623 elsewhere.)
