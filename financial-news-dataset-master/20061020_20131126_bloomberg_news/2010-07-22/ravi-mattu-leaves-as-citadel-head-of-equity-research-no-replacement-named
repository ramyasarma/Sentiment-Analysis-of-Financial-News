             Ravi Mattu , head of equity research
at Citadel Securities, left the investment-banking unit of the
brokerage firm started by  Ken Griffin .  
 Mattu left last week, said  Devon Spurgeon , a spokeswoman
for the Chicago-based Citadel LLC. No replacement has been
named, she said.  
 The departure follows the ouster in May of  Patrik Edsparr ,
head of the securities unit, who clashed with Griffin over
strategy and culture. Griffin has struggled to find the right
people to run his investment bank. Edsparr, who ran Citadel
Securities after former chief  Rohit D’Souza  quit in October,
left after seven months in the role.  Todd Kaplan , the former
head of investment banking at Citadel, left in January, less
than a year after joining the firm.  
 Citadel Securities reported earnings of $81.6 million on
revenue of $1.01 billion last year, most of which came from
Citadel’s nine-year-old options and equities market-making
business, according to financial statements filed Feb. 25 with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 Before joining Citadel in 2008 as head of fixed-income
research, Mattu was the global head of equity and fixed-income
research at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. He had previously
worked at Salomon Brothers and Citigroup Inc.  
 Citadel is planning to start publishing equity research for
clients before the end of the year covering technology, media,
health industries as well as real estate, gaming and lodging,
Spurgeon said.
