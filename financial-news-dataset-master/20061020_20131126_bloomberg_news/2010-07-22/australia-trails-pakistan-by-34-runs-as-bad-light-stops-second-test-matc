             Australia was trailing by 34 runs in
its second innings against Pakistan when play in their second
Test was stopped this evening because of bad light at Headingley
in Leeds.  
 Australia, which was all out for 88 in its first innings,
was 136-2 when play was halted, adding 70 runs since tea. Ricky
Ponting was on 61 runs, while Michael Clarke had made 32.
Australia began the innings on the second day of the Test with a
deficit of 170 runs. Pakistan was all out for 258 in its first
innings.  
 Australia had won the toss and decided to bat, having taken
the first match in the two-game series by 150 runs.  
 The series is being held in England because of security
concerns over staging games in Pakistan. It counts as a home
series for Pakistan.
