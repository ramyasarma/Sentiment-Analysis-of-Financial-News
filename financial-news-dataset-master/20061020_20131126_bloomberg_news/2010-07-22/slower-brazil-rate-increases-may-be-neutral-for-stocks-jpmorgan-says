             The Brazilian central bank’s
unexpected decision last night to moderate the pace of interest-
rate increases may ultimately be “neutral” for the country’s
 stocks , JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  
 While policy makers are now expected to raise the benchmark
 Selic  rate more slowly, the final target hasn’t changed,
analysts led by  Emy Shayo Cherman  wrote in a note to clients
today. JPMorgan cut its year-end Selic prediction to 11.25
percent, saying the central bank will increase the rate to 12.5
percent in 2011.  
 “One of the key reasons behind our domestic overweight was
the visibility on the rate cycle,” the analysts wrote. “While
JPMorgan has changed the view on the timing of the hike, it
didn’t change the magnitude. Therefore, the practical effect on
equities should be neutral.”  
 Stocks tied to domestic growth, including banks and
homebuilders, remain best poised to lead Brazil’s gains, while
commodities producers are still unattractive because of global
growth concerns, JPMorgan said.  
 The central bank increased the Selic half a point to 10.75
percent yesterday, after raising it 0.75 percentage point at its
two previous meetings.
