             American Express Co. , the biggest
credit-card issuer by purchases, may say second-quarter income
almost tripled as card spending increased more than the company
anticipated and fewer borrowers defaulted.  
 AmEx, which plans to report results after markets close
today, may post profit of $945.8 million, compared with
$337 million in the same period a year earlier, according to the
 average estimate  of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Spending on cards issued by New York-based AmEx climbed
about 15 percent in April and May, rebounding faster than Chief
Executive Officer  Kenneth I. Chenault  expected, he said during a
June 2 investor conference. Competitors including  Bank of
America Corp.  reported fewer overdue loans and improved
collections in the quarter.  
 “We could be in the early stages of a robust recovery in
spending,” said  Bruce Harting , an analyst with Barclays Plc, in
a July 12 research note. He rates AmEx “overweight” and said
the shares may reach $51 within a year.  
 AmEx, the  top performer  of 2009 in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, closed yesterday at $41.15. The shares gained
1.6 percent this year.  
 That’s better than San Francisco-based  Visa Inc. , the
world’s biggest payments network, which dropped 17 percent as
Congress approved caps on debit-card “swipe” fees charged to
merchants. The measure, part of the financial overhaul bill
signed into law yesterday by President  Barack Obama , takes
effect next year.  MasterCard Inc. , the No. 2 network, has fallen
21 percent this year.  
 ‘Unscathed’  
 AmEx is insulated from the caps backed by U.S. Senator
 Richard Durbin , the Illinois Democrat and majority whip, because
the company doesn’t issue signature debit cards or process debit
transactions.  
 “American Express is largely unscathed by Durbin,”
Citigroup Inc. analyst  Donald Fandetti  said in a July 20
research note.”  
 Overdue payments, a gauge of future write-offs, fell to
2.7 percent in June from 2.9 percent in the previous month,
according to a July 15 regulatory filing. Write-offs for loans
deemed uncollectible dropped to 5.7 percent from 6.3 percent,
the lowest of the six-biggest credit-card issuers. That
improvement may allow AmEx to recoup some of the $5.31 billion
it has set aside for future  loan losses .  
 “American Express is considerably over-reserved, which
gives it plenty of dry powder to invest to grow the top line and
perhaps begin repurchasing shares,”  Michael Taiano , an analyst
with Sandler O’Neill & Partners, said in a July 15 research
note. Taiano rates the stock “buy” and said the shares may
reach $48 within a year.  
 The company likely will use the cash to increase spending
on marketing and cardholder rewards, Buckingham Research Group
analyst  David Hochstim  said in a July 15 note to clients.
