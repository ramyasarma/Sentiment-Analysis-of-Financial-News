             Travelers Cos.,  the insurer added to
the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year, cut its full-year
profit forecast after second-quarter results missed analysts’
estimates as the economic slump pressured sales and catastrophe
costs rose. The stock posted the  biggest decline  in the Dow.  
 Net income  fell to $670 million, or $1.35 a share, from
$740 million, or $1.27, in the same period a year earlier, when
there was more stock outstanding, the insurer said today in a
 statement . Operating profit, which excludes some investment
results, was $1.39 a share, missing the $1.49 average  estimate 
of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Travelers, led by Chief Executive Officer  Jay Fishman , 57,
is competing for business in a shrinking market after job cuts
in construction and manufacturing reduced demand for business
insurance. Travelers said full-year operating profit will be
$5.20 to $5.45 a share, compared with the range of $5.20 to
$5.55 the insurer gave in May.  
 “A lot of people are concerned over the current
competitive state of the property-casualty pricing cycle,” said
analyst  Daniel Theriault  at New York-based Portales Partners
LLC. “I just don’t see a catalyst for the stock in the near
future.”  
 The insurer slipped 58 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $49.29 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Travelers has dropped 1.1 percent this year, compared with the 1
percent slide in the 30-company Dow average.  
 Policy Sales  
 Policy sales rose about 1.5 percent to $5.69 billion from
$5.61 billion in the year-earlier period. Business insurance,
the largest part of Travelers’s premium revenue,  declined  about
1 percent. Sales increased about 6 percent for home and auto
coverage through agents.  
 “The continuing difficult economic environment” weighed
on results as renewal premium increases fell below the insurers’
expectations, Fishman said in the statement.  
 Travelers earned 4.8 cents per each premium dollar in the
three months ended June 30, compared with 6.8 cents in the same
period last year on record quarterly costs from natural
disasters, including storms in Oklahoma. Catastrophe costs more
than doubled to $439 million before taxes. Insurers typically
face the highest disaster costs in the second half of the year,
which includes the Atlantic hurricane season.  
 The insurer’s book value, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, rose 4.1 percent from the end of March to $55.67
per share.  
 Investment Income  
 Net investment income rose to $617 million after tax from
$547 million in the year-earlier period. Alternative
investments, including real-estate partnerships, hedge funds and
private-equity holdings, produced a gain of $58 million,
compared with a loss of $20 million. Results from fixed-income
holdings were little changed.  
 Travelers booked a $384 million gain by withdrawing funds
from reserves after determining it had more money set aside than
needed for claims on policies sold in prior quarters. That
compares with a benefit of $261 million in the same period last
year.  
 “Reserve releases are an increasingly valuable component”
of insurers’ earnings as claims have been lower than expected,
said  Amit Kumar , an analyst at Macquarie Capital Inc.  
 Industrywide, policy sales fell 1.3 percent to $105.1
billion in the three months ended March 31, the Property
Casualty Insurers Association of America said June 23. Until the
slump began three years ago, quarterly sales had fallen only
twice since 1987. U.S. property and casualty sales have dropped
for  12 straight quarters  through March 31 as insurers lower
rates to win business.  
 Dividend Increases  
 Travelers increased its  dividend  twice in the last year and
repurchased shares after remaining profitable in the financial
crisis. Fishman put most of the company’s fixed-income
investments in municipal bonds, sidestepping the losses from
mortgage-backed securities that hobbled competitors. The insurer
has about $41 billion in municipal bonds.  
 “We believe our portfolio is strong, and we wouldn’t trade
it for anyone else’s,” Chief Investment Officer  Bill Heyman 
said today in a conference call. “We could certainly have
losses in our municipal portfolio, maybe even material losses.
But even viewed through the prism of recent events, we feel
very comfortable with what we own.”
