             Taiwan’s  jobless rate  fell in June
to the lowest level in 18 months as a recovery in exports
prompted manufacturers to hire.  
 The seasonally adjusted rate declined to 5.2 percent last
month from 5.22 percent in May, the statistics bureau said today
in Taipei. That compared with a median estimate of 5.16 percent
in a Bloomberg News  survey  of 13 economists.  
 A recovery in the global economy helped  export orders  rise
faster than economists expected in June and boosted sales at
 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , the island’s biggest
company by market value, which says it plans to hire as many as
8,000 workers at a new plant on the island.  
 “Taiwan’s economy is benefiting from strong overseas
demand,”  Hsu Kuo-an , an economist at Capital Securities Corp.
in Taipei, said before the report. “The job market is also
improving along with the economy.”  
 The government-backed Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research last week raised its 2010 economic growth forecast to
6.94 percent from an April estimate of 4.99 percent.  
 The number of unemployed people declined to 575,000 in June
from 576,000 in May. Without adjusting for seasonal factors, the
jobless rate rose to 5.16 percent from 5.14 percent.  
 Growing demand for Taiwan’s computers and flat-television
screens spurred a 22.48 percent increase last month in  export
orders , an indication of shipments in the next one to three
months, a report showed this week.  
 Morris Chang , chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor, said last
week the chipmaker will spend NT$300 billion ($9.3 billion)
building a new factory in Taichung, central Taiwan, signaling it
expects increasing global demand for the components used in
phones and computers.
