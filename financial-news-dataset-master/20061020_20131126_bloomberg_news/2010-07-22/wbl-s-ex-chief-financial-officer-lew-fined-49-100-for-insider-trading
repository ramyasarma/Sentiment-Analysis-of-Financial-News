             Kevin Lew Chee Fai , found liable in
Singapore’s first civil lawsuit for insider trading, was fined
S$67,500 ($49,100) for selling shares of WBL Corp., a Volvo and
Jaguar car distributor.  
 “The right signal has been sent to the market,” Judge Lai
Siu Chiu said at a hearing today. Lew, 50, was Singapore-based
WBL’s chief financial officer until July 2007, when he was asked
to resign.  
 The  Monetary Authority of Singapore  sued Lew, who avoided a
loss of S$27,000 by selling WBL shares two days after learning
it was forecast to report losses on July 2, 2007. The financial
regulator said after winning the case in May that insider
trading “undermines investor confidence in the integrity” of
the city’s capital markets.  
 “This will act as a deterrent to anyone who even
contemplates insider trading,” said Nicholas Hanna, a partner
at London-based law firm Watson, Farley & Williams’s Singapore
office. “Anyone who has price sensitive information and trades
on it is abusing the process and should be punished.”  
 Lew sold 90,000 WBL shares at S$4.98 each on July 4, 2007,
even after the company’s in-house lawyer said the information
shared at the meeting was price-sensitive, according to court
papers. Lew in his defense said he didn’t believe the matters
discussed on July 2, 2007, were price sensitive and sold the
shares to raise cash to exercise his WBL options.  
 “One-Off Incident”  
 Lew’s lawyer Thio Shen Yi asked Judge Lai to impose the
minimum fine of S$50,000 as Lew has been in financial hardship
since July 2007 and this was a “one-off incident.” Lew plans
to file an appeal by July 29, Thio said after the fine was
announced.  
 The regulator’s lawyer Cavinder Bull sought the maximum
penalty of S$81,000, or three times the loss avoided to be
imposed, to send a deterrent message. Lew also “showed no
remorse” for his actions and had even “conjured up stories to
conceal his conduct,” the lawyer from Drew & Napier LLC said.  
 The former WBL executive, whose last annual salary was more
than S$300,000 a year, was unlikely to be in financial hardship
as he owned two apartments, two cars and about S$1 million in
shares, Bull said.  
 WBL  shares have dropped 10.1 percent this year, compared
with a 2 percent increase on the benchmark Straits Times Index.  
 The watchdog has also sued  Tan Chong Koay  and Pheim Asset
Management Sdn. in the city’s first civil lawsuit for stock
rigging.  
 The case is Monetary Authority of Singapore vs Kevin Lew
Chee Fai S71/2009 in the Singapore High Court.
