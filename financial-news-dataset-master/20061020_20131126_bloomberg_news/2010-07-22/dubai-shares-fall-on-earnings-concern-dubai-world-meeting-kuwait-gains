             Dubai shares fell for a third time
this week amid investor concern about earnings and Dubai World
as the state-owned company seeking to renegotiate the terms on
$23.5 billion of debt met with creditors in the emirate.  
 The  DFM General Index  lost 0.2 percent to close at 1,528.97
as  Emirates NBD PJSC , the United Arab Emirates’ biggest lender,
by assets fell the most since July 18 and  Dubai Investments
PJSC , the Dubai-based investment company with stakes in more
than 40 companies, ended a five-day winning streak.  Emaar
Properties PJSC , the builder of the world’s tallest tower,
closed unchanged before reporting a second-quarter profit after
a year-earlier loss. The DFM Index rose 0.6 percent this week.  
 “Investors are being cautious,” said  Hassan El Salah ,
deputy head of institutional equities at Al Ramz Securities in
Abu Dhabi. There has been “last minute selling before any
announcement by Dubai World, especially by banks exposed to the
company,” he said.  
 Dubai World began presenting its debt restructuring plan
to about 70 banks today. Its main creditor banks agreed in May
to alter the terms on $14.4 billion of bank loans and $8.9
billion of government liabilities to resolve a crisis that
roiled global markets last year. It said banks would be paid
$4.4 billion in five years and another $10 billion over eight
years at below-market interest rates supported by assets sales.  
 Emirates NBD declined 1.6 percent to 2.46 dirhams. Dubai
Investments dropped 1.2 percent, the most since June 30, to 82.8
fils.  
 Emaar was unchanged at 3.37 dirhams. After markets closed,
it reported net income of 802 million dirhams ($218.4 million)
after a loss of 1.285 billion dirhams a year earlier. Revenue
climbed to 2.65 billion dirhams from 1.94 billion dirhams.  
 Investors were waiting for Emaar results for “an
indication to the property and construction market,” said Vyas
Jayabhanu, head of Al Dhafra Financial Brokerage LLC in Abu
Dhabi.  
 Qatar’s  QE Index  and Bahrain’s  gauge  slipped 0.1 percent.
Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  declined 0.9 percent. The  Kuwait Stock
Exchange Index  rose 0.2 percent and Abu Dhabi’s  measure  gained
0.6 percent. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index was closed
for the weekend.
