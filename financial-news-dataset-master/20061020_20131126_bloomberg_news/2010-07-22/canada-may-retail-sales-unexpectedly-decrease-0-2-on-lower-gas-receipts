             Canadian  retail sales  unexpectedly
fell in May because of lower receipts at building material
stores and gasoline stations.  
 Sales declined 0.2 percent to C$36 billion ($34.6 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg anticipated a 0.4 percent increase, according to the
median of 19 estimates. The decline reflected falling prices, as
sales in volume terms rose 0.4 percent.  
 After increasing interest rates for a second month on July
20, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney cut his forecast for
economic growth and said any further borrowing cost increases
would be “weighed carefully against domestic and global
economic developments”. Carney is slated to hold a press
conference today to discuss his forecasts.  
 May’s retail sales drop was led by a 4.1 percent decline in
sales at building material and garden equipment stores. Sales at
gasoline stations were down 2.3 percent, and motor vehicle and
parts dealers recorded a 0.5 percent drop. Six of the
measurement’s 11 components posted declines, the agency said.  
 Excluding car and parts dealers, retail  sales  fell 0.1
percent to C$28.4 billion, compared with the 0.5 percent
increase expected by economists. Sales excluding the automotive
industry and gasoline stations rose 0.2 percent.  
 The statistics agency revised its estimate for April’s
retail sales decline to 2.2 percent from the 2 percent initially
reported.  
 In a separate release, Statistics Canada said the number of
Canadians receiving unemployment insurance in May rose 1.3
percent to 680,140, the first increase in eight months. The
number claims to start or renew benefits increased 0.9 percent
in May from the previous month to 231,930, the government agency
said.
