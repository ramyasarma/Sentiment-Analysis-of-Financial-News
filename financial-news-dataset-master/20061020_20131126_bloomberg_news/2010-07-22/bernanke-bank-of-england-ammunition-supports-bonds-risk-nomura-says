             The Federal Reserve and Bank of
England’s assurances yesterday that they are able to step up
action to boost the economy may support bonds as well as assets
perceived to be higher risk, Nomura International Plc said.  
 “The perception of major central banks having more
ammunition in store but a disinclination to use it is a
deliberately reassuring one,” strategists in London led by  Nick Firoozye  wrote in an e-mailed note today. “Despite some initial
disappointment in risk assets, we believe the possibility of
further measures may ultimately restore a more lasting degree of
confidence while at the same time underpinning bonds.”
