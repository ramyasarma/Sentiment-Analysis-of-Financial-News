-- Purchases of U.S. Existing Homes Probably Dropped as Credit's Effect Waned

             Sales of U.S. previously owned homes
probably fell in June for a second month, adding to evidence the
market will slump as the effects of a government tax credit
fade, economists said before a report today.  
 Purchases  dropped 9.9 percent from May to a 5.1 million
annual rate, according to the  median  of 74 forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey. Other reports may show the outlook for
economic growth cooled and claims for jobless benefits rose.  
 A government incentive of up to $8,000 boosted sales
earlier in the year, releasing pent-up demand and indicating
additional gains will be slow to develop. Increasing
foreclosures are swelling the number of unsold homes, putting
pressure on prices and keeping buyers on the sidelines as
unemployment hovers near 10 percent and the economy cools.  
 “There is some genuine slowdown coming through,” said  Rob Carnell , chief international economist at ING Financial Markets
in London. “We’re heading back to pre-rebate territory. It does
appear we’re in a downtrend.”  
 The report from the National Association of Realtors is due
at 10 a.m. in Washington. Estimates in the Bloomberg News survey
ranged from 4.25 million to 6.2 million.  
 Like other housing data, sales of existing homes have been
whipsawed by the timing of the tax credit. After surging to a
two-and-a-half year high of 6.49 million in November, the month
of the credit’s initial expiration, they dropped for the next
three months. Demand then recovered in March and April, which
was the deadline for signing contracts, only to slip again the
following month.  
 Credit’s Influence  
 The June 30 deadline to close deals, which is when existing
home sales are tabulated, was extended to the end of September
to ensure prospective buyers had enough time to complete
transactions. The majority of those closings will have occurred
by last month, so the extension will not markedly lift demand,
said  Zach Pandl , an economist at Nomura Securities International
Inc. in New York.  
 Housing’s inability to maintain a rebound is one reason the
economic recovery is not gaining speed. Reports earlier this
week showed  housing starts  fell in June to the lowest level
since October, and homebuilder  sentiment  dropped to a 15-month
low in July.  
 The Conference Board’s index of leading economic
indicators, also due at 10:00 a.m., probably fell 0.3 percent in
June after rising 0.4 percent in May, according to the survey
median. A decline would be the first since March 2009. The gauge
measures the outlook for the next three to six months.  
 More Claims  
 A report from the Labor Department at 8:30 a.m. may show
firings remain elevated.  Initial jobless  claims rose to 445,000
last week from 429,000 the prior week, the survey showed.  
 Private payrolls rose a less-than-forecast 83,000 in June
and total jobs fell by 125,000, the first decline this year, the
Labor Department reported this month. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast unemployment will end the year at 9.5
percent, unchanged from the rate in June.  
 Foreclosures and short-sales are boosting the so-called
shadow inventory, and competing with owners trying to sell
properties. Home seizures jumped 38 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, RealtyTrac Inc. said last week,
putting lenders on pace to claim more than 1 million properties
this year.  
 The Standard & Poor’s  Supercomposite Homebuilder  Index,
which includes Toll Brothers Inc. and  Lennar Corp. , has dropped
10.3 percent year-to-date, while the S&P 500 Index is down 4.1
percent.  
 Lennar Sales  
 Sales at Miami-based Lennar, the third-biggest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue, were running 20 percent to 25 percent
lower last month than a year earlier as the expiration of the
tax credit sapped demand, Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Miller 
said June 24.  
 “The new-home market and housing in general still face
serious headwinds from current economic and legislative
conditions,” Miller said on a conference call with investors.
“The prospect of additional delinquencies ahead continues to
moderate this recovery as shadow inventory continues to be
absorbed.”
