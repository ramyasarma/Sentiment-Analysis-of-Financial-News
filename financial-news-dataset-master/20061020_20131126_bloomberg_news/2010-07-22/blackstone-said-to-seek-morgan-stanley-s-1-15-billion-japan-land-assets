             Blackstone Group LP  may buy  Morgan
Stanley  Japan’s real estate assets, making its first property
investment in the country, a person familiar with the deal said.  
 The world’s biggest private-equity firm expects to complete
a deal for assets with a face value of 100 billion yen ($1.16
billion) next week, the person said, declining to be identified
before an announcement. Blackstone may offer less than 50
percent of the face value of the portfolio, which consists of 11
non-recourse loans with about 30 office buildings mainly located
in greater Tokyo, the person said.  
 Prices for Tokyo office buildings have fallen as much as 50
percent from their 2007 peak, according to an estimate by CB
Richard Ellis Group Inc.’s Japan subsidiary.  Blackstone ’s first
purchase in the country, after opening a Tokyo operation three
years ago, may suggest prices are set to climb, said  Takashi Ishizawa , a real estate analyst at Mizuho Securities Co.  
 “The news confirms my view that property prices in Japan
have reached bottom,” Ishizawa said in a telephone interview in
Tokyo. “Now is the time to invest.”  
 Natsuo Nishio, a spokesman at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, and
 Peter Rose , a spokesman for Blackstone, declined to comment.  
 Blackstone’s second-quarter earnings rose 13 percent,
partly on a gain in the value of its real estate holdings, the
company said today. The shares climbed 43 cents, or 4 percent,
to $10.74 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:46
p.m.

 Blackstone may sell some of the buildings and own some
after the acquisition of the debt portfolio, the person said.  
 An agreement this month between Blackstone and  Bank of
America Corp. , the largest U.S. bank by assets, for the private-
equity firm to manage the bank’s portfolio of Asian real estate
investments expanded Blackstone’s business in the region.  
 The  private-equity firm  had $23.8 billion of real estate
assets under management as of March 31, according to its
website. It has capital to invest from an $11 billion U.S. real
estate fund and a European property fund of about $4 billion.  
 Japan’s nationwide average land  prices  dropped 8 percent in
2009 from a year ago, the second straight annual decline, the
 National Tax Agency  said in a report earlier this month.  
 The drop has attracted other buyers. Acquisitions by the
country’s 38 publicly traded real estate investment trusts more
than doubled in the first quarter to 229 billion yen from the
same period last year, according to IB Research and Consulting
Inc., a Tokyo-based research firm.  
 Japan’s listed real estate investment trusts have raised
195.5 billion yen in the first six months of this year, the
highest since 2008, as they look to expand their portfolios,
according to Mizuho Securities Co.  
 The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier today that a deal
between the two companies was imminent.
