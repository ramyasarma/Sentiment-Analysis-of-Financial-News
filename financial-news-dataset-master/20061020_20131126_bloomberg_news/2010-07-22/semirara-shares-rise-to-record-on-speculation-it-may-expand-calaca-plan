             Semirara Mining Corp., the largest
Philippine coal producer, climbed to a record in Manila trading
on speculation it will expand a power unit that uses the fuel.  
 Semirara jumped 7.6 percent to 106 pesos at the noon
close, the highest based on data since March 1994. DMCI Holdings
Inc. which owns Semirara, gained 2.6 percent to 19.50 pesos.   
 The shares rose on speculation Semirara will commence
rehabilitation and expansion of its Calaca power plant, which
will be “highly beneficial” for the parent, said Astro del
Castillo, managing director at Manila-based investment advisory
firm First Grade Holdings Inc. Semirara President Victor
Consunji couldn’t be reached for a comment in his office.
