             Corn in South Africa, the largest
producer of the grain on the continent, advanced as the rand
weakened against the U.S. dollar, making imports more expensive
for local millers.  
 The rand traded at 7.5527 per dollar at 12:19 p.m. in
Johannesburg, compared with 7.5476 at the close of grain trading
at noon yesterday.  
 White corn for December delivery, the most active contract,
gained 8 rand, or 0.7 percent, to close at 1,197 rand ($159) a
metric ton on the South African Futures Exchange. Meal made from
the grain is the country’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for September delivery rose 4 rand, or 0.3
percent, to 1,187 rand a ton. The grain is mainly used as animal
feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are among the
biggest exporters of the grain.  
 Wheat for September delivery advanced 7 rand, or 0.3
percent, to 2,485 rand a ton. Morocco, Egypt and Algeria are
Africa’s largest wheat growers.  
 Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold in tons:
