             Corn rose for a second straight day
on speculation that demand will increase from livestock
producers as global output of wheat and barley declines.  
 Wheat prices jumped to a 13-month high in Chicago after
drought slashed output in the European Union, Russia and
Ukraine, boosting demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s
top exporter. In the week ended July 15, the U.S. sold 540,852
metric tons for delivery after Sept. 1, the biggest weekly total
for the new marketing year, the government said today.  
 “Rising wheat prices will boost demand for cheaper corn in
livestock feed,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  “The export
sales are going to increase.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.945 a bushel at 10:37 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, after gaining as much as 1.8 percent. The most-active
contract touched $4.10 on July 15, the highest price since Jan.
12. Before today, corn gained 14 percent since June 29, the day
before the government said that U.S. farmers planted less this
year than they had planned.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
