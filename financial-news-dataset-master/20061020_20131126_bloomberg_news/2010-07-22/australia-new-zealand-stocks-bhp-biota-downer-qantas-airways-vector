 Australia:  
 Mining shares: Copper futures for September delivery rose
the most in five weeks, increasing 3 percent to $3.093 a pound
in New York yesterday.  
 BHP Billiton  (BHP AU), the world’s largest mining company,
advanced 0.3 percent to A$38.88. BHP could spend $10 billion to
$15 billion on a share buyback or a special dividend as higher
prices for iron ore and coal boost profit, MF Global analysts
said.  Rio Tinto Group  (RIO AU), the third largest mining company,
increased 0.6 percent to A$68.23.  
      Biota Holdings Ltd.  (BTA AU) rose 4.4 percent to 95
Australian cents, erasing earlier losses. The company, which got
more than half of sales last year in fees from GlaxoSmithKline
Plc’s Relenza, reported June quarter royalties for the treatment.  
 Downer EDI Ltd.  (DOW AU) climbed 1.2 percent to A$4.37. The
Australian engineering company may seek to raise as much as
A$400 million to restore its credit rating when it releases
earnings next month, the Australian Financial Review reported in
its Street Talk column, citing an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
      Qantas Airways Ltd.  (QAN AU) lost 1.7 percent to A$2.36.
Australia’s biggest airline will buy seven new Q400 NextGen
aircraft from Bombardier Aerospace valued at approximately $218
million based on the list price, the carrier said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 New Zealand:  
      Vector Ltd.  (VCT NZ) declined 2.8 percent to NZ$2.05 after
