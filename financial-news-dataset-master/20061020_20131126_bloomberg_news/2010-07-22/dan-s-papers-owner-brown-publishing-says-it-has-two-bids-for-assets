             Brown Publishing Co., the bankrupt
owner of Dan’s Papers in New York’s Hamptons, said it received
two “accepted bids” that taken together would acquire all of
its assets. The bid for most of the assets was from a company
controlled by insiders, according to court papers filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Central Islip, New York, today.
