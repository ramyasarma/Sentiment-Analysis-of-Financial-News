             Mexico’s peso gained for a third day
this week as U.S. company earnings beat estimates.  
 The peso rose 0.7 percent to 12.7841 per U.S. dollar at
8:59 a.m. New York time, from 12.8724 yesterday when the
currency declined 0.8 percent. The peso has increased 2.4
percent in 2010, the second-best performer among 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind Japan’s yen.  
 “Overnight, we had some good reports, and there was some
good news out there, so the sentiment has changed again,” said
Jorge Perez-Duarte, a managing director for emerging markets at
TD Securities Inc. in Toronto.  
 About 85 percent of companies on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 
Index that have reported since July 12 beat analysts’ estimates
for earnings, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Perez-Duarte said signs world economic growth is slowing
could push the peso beyond 13 per U.S. dollar “in the coming
days, or in the coming weeks.”  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bonds due in 2024
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.81
percent, an all-time low, according to Banco Santander SA. The
price of the security rose 0.42 centavo to 129.17 centavos per
peso.
