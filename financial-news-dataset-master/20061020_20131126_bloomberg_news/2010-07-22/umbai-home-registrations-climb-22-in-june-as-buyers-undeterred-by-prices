             Mumbai home registrations rose for
the first time in three months as buyers were undeterred by
record home prices, brokerage IIFL Ltd. said in a research note.  
 “After falling 25 percent month on month in May 2010,
apartment registrations in Mumbai staged a smart recovery in
June,” IIFL analysts  Bhaskar Chakraborty  and  Avi Mehta  said in
the note.  
 Home registrations climbed 22 percent to 6,500 in June from
the previous month, the note said. The increase in transactions
reveals that demand in Mumbai remains healthy even as prices
touch new highs, Chakraborty and Mehta said.
