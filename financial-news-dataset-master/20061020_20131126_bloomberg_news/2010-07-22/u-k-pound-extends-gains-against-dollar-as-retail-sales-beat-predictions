             The U.K. pound climbed against the
dollar after a report showed June retail sales rose more than
economists predicted.  
 Britain’s currency advanced 0.5 percent as of $1.5236 in
London and was little changed at 84.13 pence against the euro.  
 Sales climbed 0.7 percent on the month, the Office for
National Statistics said today in London. Economists forecast a
0.5 percent gain, according to the median of 24 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.
