Banco Espirito Santo SA wants  Telefonica SA  to resume talks
after Telefonica ended a 7.15 billion-euro ($9.2 billion) bid
for the Portuguese company’s stake in a Brazilian joint venture.  
 The two partners “need to get back to the negotiating
table,” Banco Espirito Santo Chief Executive Officer  Ricardo Salgado  said today at a conference in Lisbon. “The partnership
must end.”  
 Telefonica Chairman  Cesar Alierta  turned down a request
from Portugal Telecom to extend the offer beyond July 16. The
Spanish company has since hired two law firms to help dissolve
the Brasilcel NV venture, which controls Brazil’s largest
wireless company  Vivo Participacoes SA .  
 The Portuguese government blocked the offer at an investor
meeting on June 30 on concern the former monopoly would be left
without a fast-growing asset.  
 Portugal Telecom could reinvest the proceeds from a sale in
Brazil, Salgado said today. The company is in talks with Tele
Norte Leste Participacoes SA, known as Oi, and there are other
opportunities in Brazil, he said.
