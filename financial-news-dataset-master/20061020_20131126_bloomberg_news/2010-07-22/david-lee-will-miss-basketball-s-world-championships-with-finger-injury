             Golden State Warriors forward  David Lee  injured the middle finger of his right hand, ruling him out
of basketball’s world championship next month.  
 Lee sustained the injury, known as “mallet finger,” July
20 in Las Vegas while trying out for the U.S. team that will
compete in Istanbul, Turkey, in the Aug. 28 to Sept. 12
tournament.  
 After an examination yesterday in San Francisco, Lee was
told his finger will be in a splint for six weeks.  
 The 27-year-old is expected to recover by the start of
Golden State’s training camp in September. Lee signed a six-
year, $80 million contract with the National Basketball
Association team this year following a season with the New York
Knicks in which he averaged 20.3 points and 11.7 rebounds a
game.
