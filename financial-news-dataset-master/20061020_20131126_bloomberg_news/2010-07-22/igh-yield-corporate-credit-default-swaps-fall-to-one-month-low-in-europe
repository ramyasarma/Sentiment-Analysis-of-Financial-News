             The cost of insuring against losses
on European high-yield bonds fell to the lowest level in a
month, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 7
basis points to 514, the lowest since June 21, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at 2 p.m. in London.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 0.25 basis point to 114.75,
JPMorgan prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from
default also fell, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25
banks and insurers down 1 at 134 and the subordinated index 2
lower at 212.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($12.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of credit quality.
