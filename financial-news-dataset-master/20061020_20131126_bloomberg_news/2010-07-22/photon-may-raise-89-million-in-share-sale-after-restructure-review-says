             Photon Group Ltd. may raise about
A$100 million through a share sale after completing revised
earn-out deals with 15 of the companies it acquired in 2007 and
2008, cutting payments to A$86 million, from A$168 million, the
Australian Financial Review reported, without saying where it
got the information. An earn-out is future payments made by the
buyer of a business to the seller if the business’s profits
exceed a specified limit. Ad agency Young & Rubicam, a unit
of WPP Group, isn’t interested in buying parts of Photon, the
newspaper reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Hamish McLennan.
