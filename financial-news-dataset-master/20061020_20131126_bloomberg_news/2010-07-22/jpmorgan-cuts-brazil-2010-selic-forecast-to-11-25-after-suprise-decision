             JPMorgan Chase & Co. said Brazil’s
Central Bank will raise interest rates less than previously
expected after policy makers last night slowed the pace of
monetary tightening.  
 JPMorgan, in a report sent to clients, said it sees the
benchmark Selic rate ending 2010 at 11.25 percent from a
previous forecast of 12.5 percent.   
 Policy makers will pause after a 50 basis point increase at
their next meeting in September, during the height of Brazil’s
presidential campaign, before resuming increases in the first
half of 2011 on a revival of inflationary pressures, JPMorgan
economists Fabio Akira and Julio Callegari wrote.
