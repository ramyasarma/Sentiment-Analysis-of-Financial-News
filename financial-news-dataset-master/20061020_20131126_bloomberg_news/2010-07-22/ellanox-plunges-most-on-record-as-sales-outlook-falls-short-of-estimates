             Mellanox Technologies Ltd.  tumbled
the most on record after the developer of chips for computer
servers forecast third-quarter revenue about 10 percent below
analysts’  estimates .  
 The shares  slumped  27 percent, the biggest decline  since 
they began trading in Tel Aviv in July 2007, to close at 65.70
shekels.  
 Revenue in the third quarter will be about $37 million to
$37.5 million, Chief Financial Officer  Michael Gray  said
yesterday on a conference call, according to a transcript of the
call. Analysts had expected third-quarter sales of about $41.4
million, according to the average of eight analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.
