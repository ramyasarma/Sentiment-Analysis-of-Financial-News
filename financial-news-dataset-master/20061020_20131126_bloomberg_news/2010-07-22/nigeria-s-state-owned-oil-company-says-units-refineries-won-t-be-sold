             Nigeria isn’t planning to sell its
four refineries or any of the state-owned oil company’s units,
an official at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said.  
 The West African nation won’t sell the NNPC’s Petroleum
Products Marketing Co. or National Gas Co. units, Levi Ajuonuma,
the group general manager of public affairs, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  
 “I wish to categorically state that there is no
clandestine move whatsoever to privatize the nation’s
refineries, the PPMC or the NGC,” he said. “Efforts are in top
gear by the federal government to ensure the speedy reform of
the industry,” he said.
