             LG Display Co. , the world’s second-
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, posted a 51 percent
increase in second-quarter profit as demand for flat-panel
televisions and computer monitors increased.  
 Net income  for the three months ended June was 555 billion
won ($461 million), compared with 367 billion won a year earlier,
Seoul-based LG Display said in a filing today. The year-earlier
figures were revised under  International Financial Reporting
Standards , which LG Display adopted this year.  
 Demand for large-sized panels used in TVs and computer
monitors climbed 9 percent from the first three months of the
year to a record 161 million units as manufacturers built
stockpiles ahead of the third-quarter peak season, according to
Taipei-based researcher  Witsview .
