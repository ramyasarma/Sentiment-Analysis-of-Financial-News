             President  Barack Obama  signed
legislation today to limit erroneous payments by the government
and said his goal is to cut such waste by $50 billion within two
years.  
 Obama said the measure is part of his initiative to make
the government more efficient by modernizing financial systems,
cutting paperwork and eliminating outdated programs. The
ultimate effect will be to reduce the deficit, he said.  
 The law will ensure “that our government serves as a
responsible steward for the tax dollars of the American
people,” the president said at the White House. “When
government doesn’t work like it should, it has real effects on
people’s lives.”  
 Almost $110 billion was paid by the government in 2009 to
the wrong person, in the wrong amount or for the wrong reasons,
according to a White House release. The law is aimed at cutting
such payments, creating a way to recover money improperly doled
out and improving financial management at government agencies.  
 In the past three years the government paid benefits
totaling more than $180 million to approximately 20,000
Americans who had died, according to the statement. More than
$230 million in benefits were paid to about 14,000 fugitives or
people in jail who were ineligible for them, the release said.  
 Obama sought the legislation as part of an effort to trim
the budget deficit, which is projected at a record $1.55
trillion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, up almost 10
percent from last year’s $1.41 trillion.
