             China’s stocks rose for a fourth day
on the prospect the government will loosen policy tightening
measures as the economy slows and on brokerage upgrades of
steelmakers and brokerages.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index advanced 0.3 percent to
2,541.19 at 9:46 a.m. local time, erasing an earlier decline of
as much as 0.3 percent.
