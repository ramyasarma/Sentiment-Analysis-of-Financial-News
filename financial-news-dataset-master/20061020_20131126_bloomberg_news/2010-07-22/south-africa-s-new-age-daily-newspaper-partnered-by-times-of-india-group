             South Africa’s The New Age
newspaper, a daily that plans to start production in September,
said the Times of India Group has taken a stake in the business
and it will have an initial print-run of 170,000 copies.  
 The Gupta Group, the family which controls  Sahara Computers
Ltd. , control the newspaper, which will compete with at least
five large daily newspapers in the country’s major cities
including Independent News & Media Plc’s Star newspaper in
Johannesburg.  
 Essop Pahad , a former cabinet minister and adviser to the
New Age, declined to say what stake Times of India has taken in
an interview in Johannesburg today at a function to present the
newspaper.  
 In November last year  Avusa Ltd.,  the publisher of South
Africa’s Sunday Times, shuttered it’s the Weekender newspaper
three-and-a-half years after its start up because a slump in
advertising made it unviable.  
 Naspers Ltd., Africa’s largest media company which
publishes South Africa’s The Daily Sun, has been cutting staff
numbers at its newspaper and magazine titles since November
2008.
