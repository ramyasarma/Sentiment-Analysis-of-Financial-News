             Petropavlovsk Plc , Russia’s third-
largest gold producer, slumped to an 11-week low in London after
saying second-quarter output of the metal fell 16 percent and
full-year production will be at the “bottom end” of its plans.  
 Petropavlovsk declined as much as 6.2 percent to the lowest
since May 7 after second-quarter attributable production slid to
100,700 ounces, from 120,000 ounces a year earlier. Output was
hampered by delayed equipment deliveries and “extreme” cold in
the Amur region of Russia’s Far East, it said in a statement.  
 “The disappointing performance of the gold mines in the
first half and lowering of expectations, while within the
forecast range, is not good news,”  John Meyer , head of research
at Fairfax IS in London, wrote in a research note today.  
 Petropavlovsk fell 3.1 percent to 1,063 pence by 9:02 a.m.
in London after touching 1,029 pence.  
 “We got hampered by things out of our control,” Chairman
 Peter Hambro  said in a telephone interview today in London.
“We’ve told the world that we think we will manage to achieve
our target, albeit at the bottom end of it.” The company
expects full-year output of 670,000 ounces to 760,000 ounces.  
 Petropavlovsk, which produced 486,800 ounces of gold last
year, is targeting annual output of more than 1 million ounces
by 2013. The company offered $380 million of convertible bonds
in January to fund development projects, including its Malomir
mine, due to start production later this year.  
 First-half attributable output of the metal fell to 166,300
ounces from 224,600 ounces a year earlier.  
 The company won an auction for gold exploration and mining
rights in Amur that extends the license around its Pioneer
project by about 420 square kilometers (162 square miles).  
 “We’ve been sitting looking at the ground over our fence
longing to own it,” Hambro said “We’ve finally got that and
it’s a great relief.”  
 OAO Polyus Gold is Russia’s largest producer of the
precious metal, while OAO Severstal is the second biggest.
