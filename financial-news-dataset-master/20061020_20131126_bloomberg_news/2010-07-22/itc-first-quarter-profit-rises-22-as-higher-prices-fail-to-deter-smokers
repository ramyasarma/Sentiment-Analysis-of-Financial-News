             ITC Ltd. , Asia’s second-largest
cigarette maker by market value, said first-quarter  profit  rose
22 percent as an increase in prices failed to deter smokers.  
 Net income  rose to 10.7 billion rupees ($227 million) in
the three months ended June 30 from 8.79 billion rupees a year
earlier, Kolkata-based ITC said in a statement to the Bombay
Stock Exchange today. That compares with a 10.4 billion rupee
 median  estimate from 22 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Revenue from cigarette  sales  rose 12 percent even as the
company raised prices after the government increased taxes by as
much as 18 percent in this year’s budget. ITC is expanding  sales 
of shampoo, food, clothing and other goods as the south Asian
nation takes steps such as banning smoking in public places and
raising taxes to curb the habit.  
 “The company has passed on the excise tax hike without a
significant impact on volumes,” said  Anand Shah , an analyst at
Angel Broking Ltd. in Mumbai, who rates the stock “accumulate”.
“All other businesses have also done well including agriculture
and paperboards.”  
 Sales rose 16 percent to 48.2 billion rupees from 41.5
billion rupees, according to the statement.  Analysts  had
expected sales of 48.1 billion rupees.  
 Shares Gain  
 The cigarette maker’s  shares  rose 1.8 percent to 297.7
rupees at the close of trading. The Bombay Stock Exchange’s
benchmark Sensitive Index gained 0.8 percent.  
 In February, India raised the excise tax on filter-tipped
cigarettes, longer than 75 millimeters and shorter than 85
millimeters, 11 percent to 1,959 rupees for a thousand sticks,
while the duty for filter-tipped tobacco products between 60
millimeters and 70 millimeters was increased 18 percent.  
 The cigarette division’s profit before taxes and one-time
gains increased 16 percent to 13.1 billion rupees, ITC said.  
 The company, 32 percent owned by  British American Tobacco
Plc , said losses incurred in new businesses including garments,
greeting cards and snacks narrowed to 892.5 million rupees from
997.7 million rupees a year earlier.  
 Revenue from ITC’s hotel business rose for the third
straight quarter as business travel gained momentum after the
global recession and Mumbai terrorist attacks in November 2008.
Sales from the hospitality business rose 21 percent to 2.1
billion rupees in the quarter. Profit before taxes and interest
rose 26 percent to 385.2 million rupees, the statement said.
