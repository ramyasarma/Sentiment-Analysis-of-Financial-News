             Residents of Zanzibar, a semi-
autonomous archipelago in a political union with mainland
Tanzania, will vote on July 31 on a proposal to change the
constitution and form a unity government, the  Daily News  said.  
 The referendum to create a coalition government, which is
seen as key for the islands’ political reconciliation, will cost
3.7 billion Tanzanian shillings ($2.5 million), the Dar es
Salaam-based newspaper said today, citing the United Nation’s
Election Support Program.  
 Violent clashes in Zanzibar have followed successive
presidential and legislative elections in Tanzania since 2000
because of disputes over the results. The next presidential vote
is scheduled for October.
