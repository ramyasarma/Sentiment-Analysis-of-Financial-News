             European  industrial orders 
unexpectedly increased in May, led by capital goods such as
machinery, amid signs the region’s debt crisis is easing.  
 Orders  in the 16-nation euro area rose 3.8 percent from
April, when they gained 0.6 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today.  Economists  had
forecast orders to drop 0.1 percent, the median of 20 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey showed. In the year,  industrial
orders  jumped 22.7 percent.  
 The euro-region economy is gathering strength even as
governments from Spain to Greece step up budget-cutting measures
to plug deficits. Growth in Europe’s  services and manufacturing 
 industries  unexpectedly accelerated in July, data showed today.  
 Euro-area industrial orders for machinery and other capital
goods rose 5.3 percent in May from the previous month, today’s
report showed. Orders for intermediate goods such as car engines
rose 1.4 percent and those for  durable consumer goods  gained 2.9
percent. Orders advanced 2.6 percent excluding heavy transport
equipment such as ships and trains.
