             Colombia’s peso rose to a nine-month
high amid higher oil prices and as gains in U.S. equity markets
fueled demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  
 The peso advanced 0.3 percent to 1,862.40 per U.S. dollar
at 4:47 p.m. New York time, from 1,867.40 yesterday. That’s the
strongest level since Oct. 16. The currency has jumped 9.7
percent this year versus the dollar, the best performance among
world currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “Risk aversion has dropped, so investors are back in
emerging markets, seeking higher returns,” said Camilo Santana,
an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Cia. de Profesionales de
Bolsa. “We’re also seeing Colombia’s exports rise, driven by
oil.”  
 Oil, Colombia’s main export, climbed as much as 3.7 percent
today to $79.42 a barrel.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.55
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price dropped 0.712 centavo to 123.641 centavos per peso.
