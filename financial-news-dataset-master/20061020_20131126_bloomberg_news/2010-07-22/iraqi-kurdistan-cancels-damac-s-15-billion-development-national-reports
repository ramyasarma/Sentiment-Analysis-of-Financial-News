             Iraqi Kurdistan canceled a 55
billion dirham ($15 billion) real estate project by Damac
Properties, the Dubai-based developer, because the company never
started work after the global financial crisis,  The National 
reported, citing a Kurdish official.  
 The company can propose a smaller project, Hayder Mustafa
Saaid, a director general at the Kurdistan regional government’s
investment board, told The National. Damac confirmed its
construction license had been canceled, the newspaper reported.
