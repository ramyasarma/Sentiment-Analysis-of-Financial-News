             The owner of  H&H Bagels , a bagel
store on New York City’s Upper West Side, was sentenced to 50
weekends in jail after failing to pay more than $500,000 in
employee withholding and unemployment insurance taxes.  
 “The court will impose the promised sentence,” New York
state judge Juan M. Merchan told H&H Bagels’ Helmer Toro in his
lower Manhattan courtroom today. The judge also ordered
restitution.  
 Toro, 59, failed to turn over $337,261 withheld from the
paychecks of employees at his bagel business from 2003 to 2009,
according to his May plea agreement. Toro also evaded $206,151
in unemployment-insurance taxes between 2006 and 2009. As part
of the agreement, Toro must make the restitution totaling
$543,413.  
 H&H Bagels, called “legendary” by the travel guide
Fodor’s, is located on Broadway near 80th Street. The retailer
and wholesaler’s flagship baking location is on West 46th Street
near 12th Avenue. Its tagline is “Like no other bagel in the
world.”  
 Toro’s prosecution was the first brought under a 2006 New
York state law targeting companies that cheat on unemployment
taxes, according to prosecutors.  
 Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Maurice Mathis said
Toro would start serving his weekend time July 24.  
 Toro pleaded guilty in May to grand larceny, offering a
false instrument for filing and to a violation of labor law for
unemployment insurance tax manipulation, according to
prosecutors.  
 “We felt this was a civil matter,” Toro’s lawyer,  Aaron
Wallenstein , said in an interview after the sentencing. “He’s
anxious to move on.”  
 If convicted at trial, Toro could have faced up to 15 years
behind bars.  
 The case is People v. Toro, 05783/2009, Supreme Court of
New York (Manhattan).
