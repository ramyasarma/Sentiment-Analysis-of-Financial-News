             Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 
the country’s fifth-largest lender, may take a C$211 million
($202 million) debt writedown that would lower third-quarter
profit, according to Cormark Securities Inc. analyst  Darko Mihelic .  
 The writedown is equal to 55 cents a share, Mihelic said in
a research report today.  
 Canadian Imperial was the hardest hit among the country’s
banks during the financial crisis, recording C$10.9 billion in
debt-related writedowns since the collapse of the U.S. subprime
market in 2007. The Toronto-based bank has been unwinding the
debt-related activities that led to the charges.  
 Further charges may arise because CIBC may adjust the value
of its structured credit run-off business as credit default
swaps for financial guarantors tied to the portfolio widened in
the third quarter, Mihelic said in a note.  
 “We believe such a charge is not material, will be ignored
by most analysts and likely overshadowed by improved credit
metrics,” said Mihelic, who  rates  CIBC a “buy.”  
 CIBC may benefit from a decline in loan losses as the
Canadian economy strengthens, helping the bank’s credit-card
portfolio, Mihelic said.  
 CIBC’s  net income  may be more than C$1 a share for the
three-month period ending July 31, Mihelic said. Analysts are
expecting profit of C$1.56 a share, the average of six estimates
in a Bloomberg survey. CIBC is expected to report results Aug.
25.  
 Bank spokesman Rob McLeod declined to comment on the
report.
