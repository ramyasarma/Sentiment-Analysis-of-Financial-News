             Mitchells & Butlers Plc , the U.K.
pub owner that had a board shakeup in January, said sales growth
slowed during soccer’s World Cup and uncertainty remains about
“discretionary” consumer spending.  
 Like-for-like sales in the nine weeks to July 17 rose 1.2
percent, compared with a 1.8 percent increase in the 33 weeks to
May 15, the Birmingham, England-based company said in a
statement today. The World Cup had a “negative impact” on food
sales, reducing overall like-for-like sales by about 2 percent,
it said.  
 “If there’s a challenge it’s managing the consumer
uncertainty,” Chief Executive Officer  Adam Fowle  told reporters
on a conference call today. “The emergency budget has raised
the spectre of hardship for consumers. That’s the risk. They are
still massively more confident that they were in November.”  
 U.K. consumer confidence measures by Nationwide Building
Society fell to the lowest in a year in June as the government’s
planned budget cuts spooked consumers. In May Mitchells posted
first-half net income of 52 million pounds ($78.8 million)
compared with a year-earlier loss of 6 million pounds on
increased food sales and declining finance costs.  
 Like-for-like sales in the first 42 weeks of the financial
year increased 1.6 percent, with total sales up 2.1 percent in
the period, Mitchells said today.  
 Mitchells fell 3.7 pence, or 1.2 percent, to 299.7 pence in
London trading as of 8:15 a.m. The stock has gained 21 percent
this year, giving the company a market value of 1.22 billion
pounds.
