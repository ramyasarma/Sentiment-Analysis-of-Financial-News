             AT&T Inc. , the largest U.S. phone
company, reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates as customers snapped up wireless devices like  Apple
Inc. ’s iPhone.  
 Earnings , excluding a one-time gain, rose to 61 cents a
share, AT&T said in a statement today. Analysts projected 57
cents on average, according to  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
 Sales  advanced less than 1 percent to $30.8 billion.  
 AT&T is relying on its exclusive contract to carry the
 iPhone  in the U.S. to fend off competition from  Verizon
Wireless , which is touting smartphones such as the Droid X.
AT&T, which gets more than 40 percent of its sales from its
wireless unit, activated 3.2 million iPhones in the period and
gained a net 496,000 contract subscribers.  
 “They had very strong revenue,”  Chris Larsen , an analyst
at Piper Jaffray & Co. in New York, said in an interview. “And
with the strong iPhone sales, it means they’ve got that many
customers under contract for two years.” Larsen has an
“overweight”  rating  on AT&T shares.  
 The carrier raised its forecast for 2010 earnings, without
giving specific numbers. It predicted “strong” profit growth
and “improved” operating margins, compared with a previous
forecast of “stable-to-improved” earnings and margins.  
 AT&T, based in Dallas, rose 59 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
$25.51 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
 trading , for the biggest one-day gain since June 8. The shares
have lost 9 percent this year.  
 Saturating Market  
 The iPhone is helping AT&T win customers even as the U.S.
wireless market nears saturation. Apple sold 1.7 million units
of its new iPhone 4 worldwide in the first three days after its
June 24 debut and said this week it is taking steps to overcome
supply shortages for the device.  
 Still, customer gains at AT&T and rivals are slowing. There
are enough mobile devices for more than nine out of 10 people in
the U.S., according to the  CTIA  wireless industry association.  
 Jennifer Fritzsche , an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co.,
estimated 500,000 contract subscriber gains for AT&T. In the
year-earlier period, AT&T added 1.2 million such users.  
 About 27 percent of AT&T’s iPhone sales were to new
customers, down from more than 33 percent in the first quarter.  
 Network Improvements  
 AT&T has faced criticism for dropped calls in New York and
San Francisco. Chief Financial Officer  Richard Lindner  said
today on a conference call that the carrier has reduced the
number of dropped calls in the New York area by 13 percent and
by 23 percent in Manhattan alone since the fourth quarter.  
 He said improvements to the voice network in San Francisco
are running about 90 days behind those in New York. “We are
moving heaven and earth to execute our network plan,” he said.  
 AT&T’s results could serve as a bellwether for Verizon
Wireless, the largest U.S. mobile-phone carrier, which reports
earnings tomorrow. Verizon Wireless and  Sprint Nextel Corp.  are
luring customers with new devices that run Google Inc.’s Android
software, such as Motorola Inc.’s Droid.  
 Verizon Wireless, which is co-owned by Verizon
Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group Plc, may begin selling
the iPhone as soon as January, two people familiar with the
plans said last month.  
 Slowing Defections  
 AT&T’s net income in the three months through June rose 26
percent to $4.02 billion, or 68 cents a share, from $3.2
billion, or 54 cents, a year earlier. The carrier had a gain of
7 cents a share from an exchange of  Telmex Internacional SAB 
stock for America Movil SAB stock.  
 AT&T has considered international investments, particularly
in emerging markets, though it hasn’t found an appealing one
yet, Lindner said. “We would want the ability to have
substantial control over operations,” he said, without giving
specifics.  
 The reported results exclude business-software provider
Sterling Commerce, which AT&T agreed to sell to International
Business Machines Corp. in May. Including results from Sterling,
revenue was $30.9 billion. Analysts projected $30.8 billion, the
average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Sales at the mobile unit rose 10 percent to $13.2 billion.
AT&T said it reduced the monthly rate at which customers left,
known as churn, to 1.29 percent from 1.48 percent, a record low.  
 Wireline voice sales fell 13 percent to $7.2 billion and
data sales rose 8.3 percent $6.8 billion.  
 The carrier, which has reduced its workforce by more than
10,000 since the end of last year to 272,450 at the end of June,
cut operating costs by 1.7 percent to $24.7 billion.  
 “They’ve been very committed to expense reductions and
it’s certainly a positive if they can continue lowering that
while increasing revenue,”  Tim Horan , an analyst at Oppenheimer
& Co. in New York, said in an interview.  
 Brooks McCorcle, AT&T senior vice president of investor
relations, said in an interview the company plans to make
further  workforce reductions  this year, particularly in the
wireline business. She didn’t give specifics.
