             Technip SA , Europe’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, said second-quarter profit fell 8.7
percent as sales declined even as its order backlog grew.  
 Net income  fell to 106 million euros ($135.4 million) from
116 million euros, beating the 103.7 million-euro average 
estimate  of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales slumped 14
percent to 1.48 billion euros.  
 “Our expectations for an improvement in the North Sea have
been confirmed by a pickup” in contract awards, Paris-based
Technip said today in a statement, also seeing “promise” in
Brazil. The company confirmed 2010 financial goals and said
there has been “no adverse impact” from the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill on its business this year.  
 Technip, whose largest competitor in Europe is Italy’s
Saipem SpA, was among oil-service companies that suffered last
year after clients cut investments amid tighter credit markets
and a drop in oil prices from their 2008 high.  
 Technip had an order backlog of 8.26 billion euros at the
end of the June, up from 8.13 billion euros in March. The subsea
operating margin was 16.9 percent, compared with 18.8 percent
last year, according to the statement. The offshore and onshore
operating margin widened to 7.1 percent from 5.3 percent.  
 Technip confirmed a sales forecast of between 5.9 billion
euros and 6.1 billion euros this year, compared with 6.5 billion
euros in 2009 and that the operating margin on its subsea
business will be more than 15 percent.
