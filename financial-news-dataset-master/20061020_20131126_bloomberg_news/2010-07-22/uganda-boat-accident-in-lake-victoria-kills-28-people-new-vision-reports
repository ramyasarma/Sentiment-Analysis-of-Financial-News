              At least 28 people died after their
boat capsized in Lake Victoria near the  Ugandan  town of Entebbe,
 New Vision  said.  
 The boat, which was loaded with timber, fish, soda and
beer, capsized after it developed a crack, which allowed water
to gush in, the Kampala-based newspaper reported, citing Nelson
Musisi, a local official in the area. Four people survived by
holding onto pieces of the boat, it said.
