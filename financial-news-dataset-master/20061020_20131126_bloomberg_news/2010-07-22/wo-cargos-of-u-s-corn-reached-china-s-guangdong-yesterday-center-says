             Two cargos of U.S. corn, one bought
by China’s largest grain trader Cofco Ltd., arrived in
Guangdong province yesterday, helping to relieve a supply
shortage there, the China National Grain and Oils Information
Center said today in an e-mailed report. The corn needs to clear
customs and pass the quarantine control process, it added.
