             Poland may let pension funds invest
as much as 95 percent of their assets in stocks to boost returns
as the government seeks to reduce the portion of mandatory
retirement savings overseen by private managers.  
 The proposed increase from the current limit of 40 percent
will be submitted to the cabinet next week, Labor Minister
 Jolanta Fedak  said today at a news conference in Warsaw.  
 The change is part of a broader proposal to reduce employee
contributions to private pension funds to about 3 percent of
wages from 7.3 percent, with the difference remaining in the
state-managed system, Fedak said. The proposal may take effect
as soon as next year if it’s approved by parliament, she said.  
 Diverting contributions from the privately managed pension
system into a state-controlled account would help control the
budget deficit because transfers out of the state pension system
are treated as budget expenditures under European Union rules.
Poland’s budget deficit swelled to 7.1 percent of gross domestic
product last year, more than double the European Union limit.  
 Pension funds currently keep about 60 percent of their
assets in Treasury bonds and 30 percent in equities, according
to the Labor Ministry. Transfers from the budget to private
pension funds will total 22.5 billion zloty ($7.06 billion) this
year, the ministry estimates.
