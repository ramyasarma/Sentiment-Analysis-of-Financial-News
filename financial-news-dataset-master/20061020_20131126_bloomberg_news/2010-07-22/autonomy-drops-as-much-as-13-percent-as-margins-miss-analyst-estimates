             Autonomy Corp.,  the U.K.’s second-
largest software company fell the most in 12 months in London
trading after gross margins retreated.  
 Autonomy dropped as much as 13 percent, the biggest fall
since July 2009. Gross margins declined to 86 percent in the
second quarter from 88 percent a year earlier, the company said
today in a statement. “The small variation” in gross margins
was due to the sales mix which included hardware-based
appliances, Autonomy said.  
 “We estimate that after adjusting for one-offs, Autonomy
failed to grow its core business,” said  Paul Morland , an
 analyst  at KBC Peel Hunt. “Margins were well below
expectations.”  
 Corporate and government clients have remained
“cautious” on spending, Cambridge, England-based Autonomy
said today. New contracts with other technology equipment
makers such as Oracle Corp., a lead indicator of investment,
declined to 9 from 11 in the previous quarter.  
 Autonomy fell  as much as 236 pence to 1,577 pence and
traded 11 percent lower at 1,610 pence as of 10:56 a.m., giving
the company a market value of 3.89 billion pounds ($5.94
billion). The stock has risen 6.6 percent this year.  
 Acquisition  
 The company forecast “unpredictability” for the split in
revenue between the third and fourth quarters due to seasonal
effects, indicating estimates for sales may fall,  Michael Briest , an analyst at UBS AG said today in a note.  
 Autonomy, which gets about 70 percent of revenue from
North America, is “very actively” working on an acquisition
that may take place in the fall, Chief Executive Officer  Mike Lynch  said today in an interview.  
 Autonomy raised 500 million pounds by selling convertible
bonds in April and is seeking acquisitions to “defend” its
market share, rather than buying revenue growth, Lynch said.
“We’re looking for situations whereby when we do it, we create
more and more defensive walls.”  
 Second-quarter net income rose 2.9 percent to $52.5
million from a year earlier as sales climbed 13 percent to
$221.1 million.
