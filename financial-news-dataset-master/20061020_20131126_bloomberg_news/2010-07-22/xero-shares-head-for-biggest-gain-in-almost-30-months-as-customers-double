             Xero Ltd.  is headed for its biggest
gain in almost 30 months in Wellington trading after the New
Zealand accounting software developer said it has more than
doubled customers in the past year.  
 The company has 22,000 customers from 10,000 a year ago,
Chairman  Phil Norman  told the annual meeting in Wellington late
yesterday. The stock surged as much as 17 percent, its biggest
gain since Feb. 7, 2008.  
 Xero is expanding its software offer in Australia, the U.K.
and the U.S. where it will be active later this year, Norman
said in a statement sent to the stock exchange. It expects its
monthly accounts to break even at some point in the second
half of 2011, as previously forecast, he said.  
 Director  Sam Morgan  increased his stake to 4.9 percent by
buying shares from founders  Rod Drury  and  Hamish Edwards , the
company said yesterday. The two founders don’t plan to sell
further stock until the company achieves break even.  
 Xero  rose 19 cents, or 13 percent, to NZ$1.60 at 11:30 a.m.
in Wellington.
