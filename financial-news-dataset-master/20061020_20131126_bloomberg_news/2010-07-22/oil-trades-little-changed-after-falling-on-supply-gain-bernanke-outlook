             (Corrects headline to show dollar weakened.)  
 Crude oil erased losses in New York
as the dollar weakened, bolstering demand for commodities priced
in the U.S. currency.  
 Oil declined earlier after the U.S. Energy Department
reported yesterday that crude stockpiles climbed 360,000 barrels
to 353.5 million last week. Analysts had predicted a reduction
in inventories.  
 Crude for September delivery added 8 cents, or 0.1 percent,
to $76.64 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as of 8:30 a.m. London time, after falling
as low as $76.16 a barrel. Brent crude for September settlement
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange was up 1 cent to
$75.38 a barrel.
