             U.S. Senate Democrats won’t include
carbon dioxide limits for power plants or a renewable
electricity mandate in energy legislation to be taken up as
early as next week, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said.  
 The legislation will deal with offshore oil and gas
drilling regulations, energy-efficiency programs, and incentives
for natural gas-fueled vehicles, Reid, a Nevada Democrat, told
reporters today in Washington.
