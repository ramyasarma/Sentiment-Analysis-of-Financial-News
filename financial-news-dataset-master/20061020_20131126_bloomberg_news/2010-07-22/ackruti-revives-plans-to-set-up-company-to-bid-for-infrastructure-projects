             Ackruti City Ltd. , an Indian
builder of homes, will revive a plan to set up a unit to bid
for infrastructure projects as the government prepares to
double spending on constructing utilities, ports and roads.  
 The new company will be ready in a year, Chairman  Hemant Shah  said in an interview. Ackruti had shut Infrastructure
Investment Ltd. a decade earlier after the company failed to
win projects, he said.  
 India, ranked below war-ravaged Ivory Coast and Sri Lanka
for the quality of infrastructure, needs to spend $1 trillion
on power plants and social work projects in the five years
ending 2017, according to the nation’s Planning Commission.
Ackruti will bid for projects to build bus terminals and other
infrastructure, Shah said.  
 “In a way we are already in the business and going
forward we will pursue higher aspirations,” Shah said in an
interview in Mumbai yesterday.  
 Ackruti’s  shares , which have declined 6.9 percent this
year, gained 0.7 percent to 516 rupees at 10:59 a.m. in Mumbai.  
 India is ranked 89 out of 133 nations for its
infrastructure, according to the World Economic Forum’s  Global
Competitiveness Index .
