             William Rutledge , executive vice
president and head of bank supervision at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, will retire on Dec. 31.  
 “The passage of regulatory reform is an important
milestone that creates new challenges and opportunities for bank
supervision,” Rutledge said in a statement today. “After
having spent many wonderful years at the New York Fed, I believe
this is the right moment to announce the change to pass the
torch on to a new generation of leadership in the group at year-
end.”  
 Rutledge joined the New York Fed in 1974 as an economist
and was appointed head of the bank supervision group in 1999,
according to the statement. The New York Fed didn’t name a
replacement.
