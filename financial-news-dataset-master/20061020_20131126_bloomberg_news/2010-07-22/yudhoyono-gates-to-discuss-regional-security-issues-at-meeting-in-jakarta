             Indonesian President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  and U.S. Secretary of Defense  Robert Gates  will
discuss regional security issues when they meet today in
Jakarta, Yudhoyono told his Cabinet.  
 The U.S. Embassy confirmed the meeting, declining to
provide further details. Yudhoyono commented on Gates’s visit in
opening comments at a cabinet session this morning. Defense
Minister  Purnomo Yusgiantoro  will also hold talks with Gates,
the presidential office press bureau said.  
 Gates was in South Korea yesterday with Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton  as the pair seek support for tougher sanctions
against North Korea amid concern Kim Jong Il’s regime is helping
Myanmar pursue a nuclear weapons program. Clinton is now in
Hanoi to attend Asia’s largest security forum, hosted by
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Indonesia
is a member.  
 Asean countries will push North Korea at the summit to
rejoin six-party disarmament talks, Indonesian Foreign Minister
 Marty Natalegawa  said in Hanoi yesterday.  
 Today’s meeting comes after President  Barack Obama 
postponed plans for a trip to Indonesia and Australia for a
second time last month as officials battled the worst oil spill
in U.S. history. Obama originally planned to visit the two
countries in March. That trip was postponed so he could be in
Washington as Congress debated health-care legislation.
