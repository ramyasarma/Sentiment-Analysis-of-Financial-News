             Shui On Land Ltd. , a Shanghai-based
developer controlled by Hong Kong billionaire  Vincent Lo , plans
to sell some of the group’s retail and office properties outside
the company’s home city to help maintain cash flow.  
 The company, which built and operates the  Shanghai
Xintiandi  entertainment, retail and hotel district, is in
discussion with various parties about the sale, though no
agreement has been reached, Managing Director  Freddy Lee  said in
an interview in Hong Kong. He declined to identify the companies.  
 Lo, son of late Hong Kong property tycoon  Lo Ying-shek , is
tapping China’s growth by building high-end real estate
residential and commercial projects that cater to the nation’s
growing middle class. Home  prices  in 70 Chinese cities rose 11.4
percent in June from a year earlier compared to 12.4 percent in
May, according data from the statistics bureau.  
 “We are planning to either sell some of these assets or
invite partners to work with us on these projects,” said Lee,
who was appointed managing director last month. “Except for our
flagship projects such as the Xintiandi complex in Shanghai,
we’re open to any potential disposal.”  
 Shui On, which also has projects in cities including Dalian,
Wuhan and Foshan, in April posted a 48 percent jump in 2009
profit to 2.67 billion yuan ($394 million), as economic growth
boosted home sales and prices.  
 The company’s shares, listed in Hong Kong, fell 0.6
percent to HK$3.48 at the 4 p.m. close today. They have declined
24 percent this year, compared with a 4.5 percent drop in the
Hang Seng Property Index, as the Chinese government introduced
measures to curb soaring property prices.  
 Hottest Market  
 China overtook Hong Kong as the world’s hottest housing
market in the first quarter, with prices rising at more than
double the rate anywhere else, according to property adviser
Knight Frank LLP.  
 The government on July 12 vowed to enforce measures to
dampen the market that include a ban on loans for third-home
purchases, higher mortgage rates and tighter down-payment
requirements for second-home purchases.  
 The value of property sales in China rose 25 percent in the
first half to 1.98 trillion yuan, while investment in projects
rose 38 percent to 1.97 trillion yuan, according to statistics
bureau data.  
 Lo was named one of Hong Kong’s richest men by Forbes
Magazine in February, with an estimated wealth of $1.95 billion.  
 He founded Shui On Group, parent of both Shui On Land and
Shui On Construction & Materials Ltd., in 1971 with a HK$100,000
($12,800) loan from his father.  
 Shui On earlier this month posted 1.5 billion yuan of
contracted sales for the first half. Lee said the group is still
on track to meet its 6 billion yuan target for the full year.
