             Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide
Inc. , owner of luxury brands including the St. Regis and W
hotels, reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates and
raised its forecast for revenue per available room.  
 Excluding one-time items, income from continuing operations
rose to $67 million, or 35 cents a share, from $40 million, or
22 cents, a year earlier, the White Plains, New York-based
company said in a statement today. Analysts predicted earnings
on that basis of 26 cents a share, according to the average of
18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The lodging industry has shown signs of recovery this year
after the U.S. recession suppressed travel demand in 2009.
Occupancy at U.S. chain hotels with the costliest rooms climbed
to 66 percent through June from 60 percent a year earlier,
according to  Smith Travel Research  Inc.  
 “Looking at occupancy, we are confident rates will sustain
their rise through the year,” Starwood Chief Executive Officer
 Frits van Paasschen  said during a conference call with analysts
and investors. “A rebound in business travel bodes well for
corporate rate negotiations going forward.”  
 Starwood shares gained $1.65, or 3.8 percent, to $45.45 as
of 4:10 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months.  
 Revenue Rise  
 Revenue at Starwood, the third-largest U.S. lodging
company, increased 13 percent to $437 million in the quarter.
Revenue per available room, or revpar, climbed 12 percent in
North America and 13.1 percent worldwide at properties the
company has operated for at least a year.  
 Starwood  forecast  an increase for 2010 worldwide revpar of
7 percent to 9 percent on a same-store, constant dollar basis.
In April, it predicted a gain of as much as 8 percent.  
 “The bigger exposure to luxury compared to its competitors
is going to benefit Starwood,”  William Marks , a San Francisco-
based senior analyst at JMP Securities LLC, said before the
earnings release. “Many markets outperformed those of the U.S.
Starwood is well-positioned with half of its hotels outside of
this country.”  
 Starwood is looking to sell more of its hotels to focus on
management. The company currently owns about 60 of the 1,011
that operate under one of its  brands .  
 Divestiture Options  
 “As we get to the point when we look at a bigger
transaction, we would consider spinning off” a real estate
investment trust, said  Van Paasschen . “The Host transaction
worked well for us and we would be interested in something
similar with owners who have the mindset and ability.”  
 Starwood at the end of 2005 agreed to sell more than 30
properties to  Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. , then known as Host
Marriott Corp., for about $3.4 billion.  
 Net income declined 15 percent to $114 million, or 61 cents
a share, from $134 million, or 74 cents, a year earlier. A gain
from an Italian tax-incentive program boosted the 2009 results
by $112 million, Starwood said.  
 The hotelier expects to cut net debt to about $2.5 billion
by the end of this year from $2.82 billion at June 30.  
 Marriott International Inc. , the largest U.S. hotel chain,
said last week that second-quarter profit more than tripled and
the company increased its full-year earnings forecast.
