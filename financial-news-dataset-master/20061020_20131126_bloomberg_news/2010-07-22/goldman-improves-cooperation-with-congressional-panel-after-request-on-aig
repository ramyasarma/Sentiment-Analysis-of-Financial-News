             Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which was
criticized by lawmakers for its previous unwillingness to
provide a list of counterparties the bank used to hedge the risk
that American International Group Inc. would fail, has improved
cooperation with a congressional panel.  
 “Goldman’s apparent willingness to cooperate fully is a
welcome change from their previous unwillingness to disclose
details of the taxpayer assistance they received in the AIG
rescue,” said Peter  Jackson , a spokesman for  Elizabeth Warren ’s
Congressional Oversight Panel, in a statement today.
“Transparency and accountability are paramount.”  
 Senator  Charles Grassley , Republican of Iowa, asked Warren
at a July 21 hearing “why shouldn’t the public know who these
ultimate beneficiaries of taxpayers’ support actually are?” AIG
received a bailout that swelled to $182.3 billion.
