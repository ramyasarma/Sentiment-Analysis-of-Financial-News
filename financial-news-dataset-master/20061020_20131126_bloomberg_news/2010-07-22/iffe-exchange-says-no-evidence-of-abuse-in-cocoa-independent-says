             The Liffe exchange in London has
found “no evidence” of abuse in the cocoa market, the
Independent reported, citing an exchange letter to a group that
complained of speculation in the cocoa market.  
 There is also no evidence that “any market participant is
trading with the specific purpose of distorting the price of the
July 2010 delivery month,” Liffe said, according to the
newspaper.
