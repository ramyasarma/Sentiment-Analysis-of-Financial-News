             Faurecia SA , Europe’s largest maker
of car interiors, raised full-year targets after posting its
first profit since 2005 on a surge in sales to automakers
including  PSA Peugeot Citroen .  
 Net income amounted to 101.9 million euros ($130 million)
in the first six months, compared with a 364.6 million-euro loss
a year earlier, the company said today in a statement. Sales
jumped 27 percent to 6.83 billion euros, rising in all product
categories.  
 The first-half performance was “driven by a general upturn
across all business groups,” the company said, raising its 2010
forecasts for sales growth, operating income and net cash flow.  
 Faurecia, based in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, lifted its
full-year operating-income target to 340 million euros from the
200 million euros it forecast in February and predicted sales
growth of between 13 percent and 16 percent, rather than 4
percent.        
 In addition to a rebound in vehicle production, the
company is benefiting from lower costs after eliminating jobs
and closing plants to weather the economic crisis. The company
last recorded positive net income for the first half of 2005.  
 First-half operating income was 216.5 million euros, or 3.2
percent of sales, Faurecia said. That compared with a loss of
187.3 million euros recorded a year earlier, for a negative 4.3
percent operating margin.  
 Sales at the emissions-control division, Faurecia’s
largest, jumped 36 percent to 2.32 billion euros, helped by the
revival of U.S.-based Emcon Technologies, purchased by the
French carmaker while in bankruptcy proceedings last November.  
 The seating and interiors divisions both posted 23 percent
revenue gains, to 2.31 billion euros and 1.57 billion euros
respectively, while sales of exterior parts gained 24 percent.  
 Net cash flow will top 100 million euros in 2010, Faurecia
also said today, an improvement on the “positive” cash flow it
predicted in February.
