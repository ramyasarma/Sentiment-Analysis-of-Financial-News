             Fiat SpA  was upgraded to “buy”
from “hold” at UniCredit Research and Societe Generale SA.  
 “A likely increase in consensus estimates and the demerger
plan approved yesterday represent two interesting triggers for
investors to be more bullish on the stock,” UniCredit analyst
 Gabriele Parini  wrote in a note.  
 Societe Generale analyst  Philippe Barrier  noted that “the
operational leverage from the restructuring measures undertaken
in 2008 and 2009 are bearing fruit, while Fiat is seeing
substantial signs of recovery all around the world, driving a
firm uptick in demand, save for autos.”  
 UniCredit and Societe Generale set new price estimates for
the carmaker that acquired 20 percent of Chrysler Group LLC last
year at 12.7 euros and 14 euros, respectively.
