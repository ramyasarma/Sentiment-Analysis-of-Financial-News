             Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. , the
Canadian convenience-store chain, raised its offer for Casey’s
General Stores Inc. by 75 cents a share to persuade shareholders
to back its takeover.  
 The new offer is $36.75 a share, the Laval, Quebec-based
company said today in a statement. Couche-Tard made the  bid 
public April 9 after Casey’s rebuffed approaches. Casey’s
advised  shareholders  today not to take action until it evaluated
the new offer.  
 Couche-Tard, which has announced at least 29 acquisition
targets in the U.S. since 2001, plans to use the purchase to
expand in the Midwest. Casey’s, with more than 1,500 locations,
had said the earlier bid “significantly undervalues” the
company, and its board recommended that  shareholders  reject that
offer. The new offer would still value Casey’s at about $1.9
billion, Couche-Tard said today.  
 The Canadian chain began an unsolicited tender offer for
Casey’s last month, urging the U.S. company to accept the bid or
face a proxy fight. Couche-Tard plans to nominate a slate of
nine independent candidates for election to Casey’s  board . A
representative for Casey’s didn’t immediately return a phone
message.  
 Casey’s, based in Ankeny, Iowa, rose 20 cents to $36.21 at
4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The shares
have gained 13 percent this year. Couche-Tard climbed 15 cents
to $21.46 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
