             Temperatures are expected to climb
near 100 degrees as heat blasts New York and Philadelphia this
weekend, according to the National Weather Service.  
 Highs of 99 degrees (37 Celsius) are forecast in both
cities for the day after tomorrow, according to the weather
service. Washington and Baltimore are expected to reach at least
100 this weekend as well.  
 “All the things are coming together for a really
sweltering day,” said  Tim Morrin , observation program leader
for the weather service in  Upton, New York . “That is when you
are getting pretty much the likelihood of big-ticket heat stroke
problems if you don’t take care of yourself.”  
 When coupled with the humidity in the air, New York may
feel as hot as 107 and the heat indexes may be even higher in
cities to the south. New York is on pace to have its hottest
month on record, according to the weather service.  
 “That should put a big strain on the power grid,” said
Allan Huffman, a meteorologist for  AirDat LLC  in North Carolina,
which installs weather-gathering sensors on commercial aircraft.  
 New York’s average temperature so far in July is 81.8
degrees, warmer than the record set in July 1999 of 81.4,
according to weather service records.  
 The higher-than-normal temperatures have driven up electric
power use around the U.S., including in New York, which recorded
its third-highest hourly peak load of 33,542 megawatts on July
6, when temperatures reached a record for the day of 103 degrees
in Central Park.  
 Peak Loads  
 The highest hourly peak load was 33,939 recorded on Aug. 2,
2006, according to a statement by  New York Independent System
Operator  in Rensselaer, New York, a not-for-profit corporation
responsible for running the state’s bulk electricity grid.  
 Temperatures in Central Park have broken 100 twice this
month for the first time since 1999, according to weather
service records. If the temperature reaches 100 again, 2010
would be the first year with three days at that mark since 1993.
The record is four, in 1953 and 1966.  
 “Many cities across the mid-Atlantic and southern portions
of the Northeast will have their hottest or at least be in the
top three hottest on record for the month of July,” said  Jim Rouiller , a senior energy meteorologist at  Planalytics Inc.  in
Berwyn, Pennsylvania.  
 Morrin said temperatures will break as the weekend goes on
as a cold front moves through the area.  
 Degree Days  
 Since June 1, the cooling degree days value in Central Park
has been 656, or 193 above normal, according to the weather
service.  
 Cooling degree days , calculated by subtracting a base of 65
degrees from the average daily temperature, is a value designed
to show energy demand, according to the weather service. The
higher the value, the warmer the weather, and thus the more
energy is probably consumed to cool homes and businesses.  
 In Philadelphia, the value since June 1 has been 762, or
268 above normal. At Washington Reagan National Airport, it has
been 847, or 237 above normal, and at Baltimore it has been 764,
or 278 above normal, according to the weather service.  
 Natural gas for August delivery rose 8.9 cents, or 2
percent, to $4.602 per million British thermal units at 11:44
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
