             Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd .,
India’s second-biggest drugmaker, posted a 14 percent drop in
first-quarter profit on weaker revenue from North America and
Europe.  
 Net income fell to 2.1 billion rupees ($45 million), or
12.3 rupees a share, from 2.44 billion rupees, or 14.4 rupees, a
year earlier, the Hyderabad, India-based company said in a
statement today. That’s less than the 2.35 billion rupee average
of 16 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg in the past four
weeks. Sales decreased 7.7 percent to 16.8 billion rupees.  
 Dr. Reddy’s lost 1.4 percent to 1,385.20 rupees as of 2.55
p.m. in Mumbai trading, headed for the lowest close since May 28.
India’s benchmark Sensitive index gained 0.5 percent.
