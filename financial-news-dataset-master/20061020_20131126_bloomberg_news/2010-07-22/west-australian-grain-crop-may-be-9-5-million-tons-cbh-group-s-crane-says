             Grain production in Western
Australia, the nation’s largest producing state, may drop to 9.5
million metric tons this year, CBH Group Chief Executive Officer
 Andrew Crane  said in an interview.  
 “A large crop is 14.5 million, a drought crop is 6
million; at the moment our very earliest estimates might be
around 9.5 million,”  Crane  said in Perth.  
 So-called receivals by CBH Grain from the past harvest were
“just over” 11 million tons, he told the group’s annual
meeting on March 30. Planting in Western Australia this year was
completed in dry conditions, the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics said last month.  
 Weather models were mostly signaling dry conditions for the
state from July to September, Crane said yesterday.  
 Australia’s total wheat production was likely to be around
22 million tons this year, CBH Grain Head of Trading Matthew
Rutter said yesterday. Output may increase to 22.1 million tons
from 21.7 million tons last year, according to the government’s
commodity forecaster. The wheat crop is mostly harvested from
October to early January.
