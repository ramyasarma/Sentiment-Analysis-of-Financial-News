             The following companies’ shares may
be active in Zurich. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names. Prices are from the last close.  
 The  Swiss Market Index  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies gained 9.24, or 0.2 percent, to 6,132.66. The
broader  Swiss Performance Index  gained 0.2 percent to 5,426.68.  
 ABB Ltd.  (ABBN VX): The world’s largest builder of
electricity networks forecast a recovery in demand in the power
business after reporting better-than-expected second-quarter net
income and rising orders.  
 Profit fell to $623 million in the second quarter from $675
million a year earlier. That beat an average estimate of $554.5
million in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The shares gained 2.9
percent to 19.65 Swiss francs.  
 Credit Suisse Group AG  (CSGN VX): Switzerland’s second-
largest bank posted a 1.4 percent rise in second-quarter net
income to 1.59 billion Swiss francs ($1.52 billion), after the
company booked a tax credit and gains on its own debt. Earnings
beat the 1.23 billion-franc median estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News. The shares rose 2.4 percent to 44.25 francs.  
 Julius Baer Group Ltd.  (BAER VX): The firm aims to buy a
traditional private bank in Germany that earns more than 80
percent of its revenue from wealth management, Handelsblatt
reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Boris
Collardi. The shares rallied 6.3 percent to 34.04 francs.  
 Roche Holding AG  (ROG VX): The world’s biggest maker of
cancer drugs reported a 58 percent increase in first-half profit
to 5.47 billion Swiss francs, helped by lower Genentech
integration costs. Analysts expected profit of 5.63 billion
francs, according to a Bloomberg survey. The shares lost 4.2
percent to 137 francs.  
 Sulzer AG  (SUN SW): The company expects full-year orders to
remain at a “comparable level” to last year’s.  
 “The lower order intake in the second half of 2009 will
result in lower sales and operating income this year,” Sulzer
said in a statement “Profitability is forecast to remain at a
healthy level.” The shares rose 3.3 percent to 108.2 francs.  
 Syngenta AG  (SYNN VX): The world’s biggest maker of
agricultural chemicals said first-half net income declined 11
percent to $1.25 billion as burgeoning inventories of pesticides
and crop-care products in North America hurt pricing. That fell
short of the $1.38 billion predicted by analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. The stock gained 1 percent to 242 francs.
