             Brunei Shell Petroleum Co., the
Southeast Asian country’s biggest crude producer, increased
official selling prices retroactively by 6.9 percent, reflecting
last month’s rebound in global benchmark futures.  
 The company posted its  Seria Light Export Blend  for June at
$75.53 a barrel, up $4.87, from an eight-month low of $70.66 for
May, said an official who asked not to be identified because of
company policy. The  Champion  grade, fixed at 15 cents below
Seria Light, sold for $75.38 a barrel.  
 Oil in New York gained 2 percent in June after tumbling 14
percent in May, the biggest monthly decline since December 2008.
Futures for September delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange fell for a second day today to trade below $77 a barrel.  
 Brunei Shell Petroleum is a joint venture between  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc  and the Brunei government.
