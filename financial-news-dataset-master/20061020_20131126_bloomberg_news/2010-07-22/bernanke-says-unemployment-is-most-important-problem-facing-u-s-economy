             Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said unemployment is “the most important” problem
facing the U.S.  
 “Unemployment is the most important problem we have right
now, and we take the dual mandate extremely seriously,” he said
today in response to questions at the House Financial Services
Committee in the second day of semiannual congressional
testimony on monetary policy. “I would respectively disagree
that we haven’t been doing anything or not been urgent.”  
 The Fed has “pushed monetary stimulation to the highest
point in American history” and “tripled our balance sheet,”
among other “very strong steps,” Bernanke said. “What we can
do is make financial conditions as supportive of growth as we
can and we are certainly committed to doing that.”
