             Brazil’s  unemployment  rate fell to
the lowest level for the month of June since at least 2002.  
 Unemployment fell to 7.0 percent in June, the national
statistics office said today in Rio de Janeiro. The figure was
lower than the median estimate of 7.3 percent among 34
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg. Unemployment was 7.5 percent
in May.  
 The yield on the interest rate future contract maturing
January 2011, the most traded today on Sao Paulo’s BM&F
Exchange, fell 12 basis points to 10.86 percent at 8:07 a.m. New
York time. The real rose 0.6 percent to 1.7704 per dollar.  
 The central bank unexpectedly slowed the pace of  interest
rate  increases yesterday after consumer prices fell for the
first time in four years, raising the benchmark interest rate by
half a percentage point to 10.75 percent.  
 Brazil’s $1.6 trillion economy has shown signs of cooling
from its 9 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter.
 Industrial output  and  retail sales  grew less in May than
analysts had forecast, and June tax collection was less than
predicted.  
 Still, the economy is likely to expand at its fastest pace
in more than two decades this year, keeping  inflation  above the
government’s 4.5 percent target until the second quarter of
2012, the central bank said in a quarterly report June 30.  
 Economists surveyed by the central bank raised their
inflation forecast for the next 12 months for a third
consecutive week to 4.96 percent, a report this week showed.  
 Consumer price increases have exceeded the government’s
 target  in every month during the first half of the year and are
forecast to end 2010 at 5.42 percent before slowing to 4.8
percent by the end of 2011, a central bank survey of about 100
economists published this week showed. Policy makers target 4.5
percent inflation, plus or minus two percentage points.
