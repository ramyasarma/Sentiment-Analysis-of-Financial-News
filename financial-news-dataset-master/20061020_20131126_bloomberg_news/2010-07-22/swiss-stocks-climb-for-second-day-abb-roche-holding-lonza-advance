             Swiss stocks climbed for a second
day after ABB Ltd. posted better-than-estimated earnings and a
report showed unexpected growth in euro-area services and
manufacturing.  
 ABB  advanced 4.2 percent after the world’s largest builder
of electricity networks also forecast a recovery in demand in
the power business. Roche Holding AG and Lonza Group AG rose
respectively 1 percent and 2 percent after both companies
reported increased net income. Credit Suisse Group AG limited
the rally by falling 1 percent in Zurich.  
 The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  gained 61.52, or 1
percent, to 6,194.18 in Zurich. The broader  Swiss Performance
Index  advanced 0.9 percent to 5,477.81.  
 A composite index based on a survey of euro-area services
and manufacturing purchasing managers rose to 56.7 in July from
56 in June. Economists had projected a drop to 55.5, the median
of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed. A separate gauge
of German manufacturing also unexpectedly gained this month.  
 ABB climbed 4.2 percent to 20.48 Swiss francs. Net income
fell 7.7 percent to $623 million in the second quarter, beating
the average estimate of $554.5 million in a Bloomberg survey.
Orders rose 5 percent to $7.67 billion.  
 Roche  gained 1 percent to 138.4 francs, rebounding from
yesterday’s 4.2 percent selloff. The world’s biggest maker of
cancer drugs reported a 58 percent increase in first-half profit
to 5.47 billion Swiss francs ($5.3 billion), helped by lower
costs associated with the acquisition of Genentech.  
 Lonza Earnings  
 Lonza Group  rose 2 percent to 72.95 francs. The world’s
biggest maker of drug ingredients reported a 14 percent increase
in first-half profit to 135 million francs as orders stabilized.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Stefan Borgas  said in a conference
call with reporters that the company expects earnings before
interest and taxes in 2010 at least to match last year’s level
of 380 million francs.  
 Julius Baer Group Ltd , the 120-year-old Swiss private bank,
advanced 5 percent to 35.74 francs, extending gains of 6.3
percent yesterday. UBS AG and Bank Vontobel AG lifted their
price estimates to 34 francs from 32 francs and to 36 francs
from 34 francs, respectively, citing first-half results.  
 Credit Suisse dropped 1 percent to 43.80 francs after
Switzerland’s second-largest bank reported a drop in profit at
its investment banking unit in the second quarter as trading
revenue slumped.  
 Syngenta AG  tumbled 5.3 percent to 229.3 francs as the
world’s biggest maker of agriculture chemicals abandoned its
target for earnings growth this year after burgeoning
inventories of fungicides and crop-care products in North
America hurt pricing.  
 The company also reported an 11 percent decline in first-
half net income to $1.25 billion, or $13.39 a share. Profit fell
short of the $1.38 billion predicted by analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.
