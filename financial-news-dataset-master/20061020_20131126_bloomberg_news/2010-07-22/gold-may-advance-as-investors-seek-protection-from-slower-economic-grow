             Gold may gain in London on
speculation investors will buy the metal as a means to protect
wealth.  
 The dollar declined against the euro before U.S. reports
today forecast to show initial jobless claims rose and existing
home sales declined. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said yesterday that the economic outlook remains “unusually
uncertain.” Stress-test results on European banks will be
released tomorrow.  
 “We see support coming from the potential that safe haven
is demanded,”  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global Holdings
Ltd. in Chicago, said today in a report. “Markets aren’t
content to sit back and watch the Fed do nothing more. This
should be bearish for risk.”  
 Gold for immediate delivery added $3.95, or 0.3 percent, to
$1,189 an ounce at 11:31 a.m. in London. Bullion for August
delivery was 0.3 percent lower at $1,188.70 on the Comex in New
York.  
 The metal fell to $1,187 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,191.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. The dollar fell as
much as 0.8 percent against the euro today. Bullion typically
moves inversely to the U.S. currency.  
 Gold is up 8.4 percent this year and set a record $1,265.30
on June 21 as investors sought to protect their wealth against
the European debt crisis and on concern that the global economy
may slow. European regulators are examining the strength of 91
banks to determine whether they can survive potential losses on
sovereign-debt holdings.  
 ‘Big Run’  
 Bernanke said yesterday that policy makers are prepared to
act as needed to aid growth. He will testify to the House
Financial Services Committee today.  
 “Gold had a big run last month as the European debt crisis
drove a flight to safety, so it has been consolidating those
gains in the past few weeks,” said  Liu Mingliang , a Sichuan-
based analyst at Chengdu Brilliant Futures Co. “There’s little
conviction to either buy or sell gold at the moment, so the
market will take its direction from other markets.”  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, were unchanged at 1,308.13 metric tons
yesterday, according to the company’s website. Global holdings
of the metal by ETFs were little changed at 2,071.7 tons
yesterday, according to  Bloomberg data  from 10 providers.  
 Silver for immediate delivery in London added 0.9 percent
to $17.805 an ounce. Platinum was 0.1 percent higher at
$1,518.50 an ounce, and palladium was up 0.4 percent at $450.25
an ounce.
