             SunTrust Banks Inc.  and  Fifth Third
Bancorp  led U.S. regional banks higher in New York trading on
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates and lower loan-loss
provisions.  
 The  KBW Bank Index  gained as much as 3.5 percent after
Pittsburgh-based  PNC Financial Services Group Inc.  and BB&T
Corp., based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said non-
performing assets fell for the first time since 2006. Two Ohio
banks,  Fifth Third  and KeyCorp, posted their first profits in at
least four quarters as they cut provisions for loan losses by
more than two-thirds from a year earlier.  
 The reports mirrored better-than-estimated earnings from
the four largest U.S. banks during the past week. The six
largest lenders that reported today set aside a combined $2.88
billion to cover loan losses, a 43 percent decrease from $5.03
billion a year earlier.  
 “The economy is still slow and sluggish, but it’s much
better year-over-year,” said  Stephen Steinour , chief executive
officer of Huntington Bancshares Inc., which beat analysts’
 estimates  today with its second consecutive quarterly profit.
“We actually expect credit quality to continue to improve
through the second half. We’ve emerged out of a turnaround stage
now.”  
 SunTrust  climbed $1.27, or 5.7 percent, to $23.69 at 9:56
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Fifth Third
jumped 6.5 percent, while KeyCorp increased 2.8 percent and PNC
climbed 2.6 percent.  Huntington  advanced 4.6 percent. BB&T fell
5.6 percent.  
 Financial Overhaul  
 Several of the banks said revenue may be hurt by the
financial-overhaul bill that President  Barack Obama  signed into
law yesterday. The law, which the Senate passed last week after
more than a year of negotiations, establishes an independent
consumer protection agency and limits fees on credit and debit
cards.  
 PNC’s second-quarter  net  income more than tripled to $803
million, or $1.47 a share, from $207 million, or 14 cents, in
the same period a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-based bank said
in a statement today. Twenty-seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had an average profit estimate of $1.27 a share.  
 Excluding dividends on preferred shares, including those
held by the U.S. Treasury’s bailout fund, SunTrust reported a
profit of $12 million and Fifth Third posted earnings of $192
million. Those figures compared with losses of $183 million and
$10 million a year earlier, respectively.  
 KeyCorp Profit  
 KeyCorp’s net income was $70 million, or 3 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $394 million, or 68 cents, in the
year-earlier period, the Cleveland-based lender said today in a
statement. The average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was a loss of 11 cents.  
 BB&T posted earnings of $224 million, up from $208 million
a year earlier. Huntington recorded $48.8 million in net income,
or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of $125 million, or 40
cents, a year earlier, the company said in a statement today.  
 Bank of America Corp.,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Citigroup Inc.
and  Wells Fargo & Co.  all beat estimates as they reduced the
size of their loan-loss provisions, the companies said in the
past week.  
 “The banking system showed with the numbers we just got
that it has moved to a position of health,”  Michael Holland ,
who oversees more than $4 billion as chairman of Holland & Co.
in New York, said earlier this week. “The patient is fully
recovered.”  
 BB&T said nonperforming assets decreased 3.1 percent, the
first decline since the first quarter of 2006. At PNC, the
sixth-largest U.S. bank by deposits, nonperforming loans dropped
8.3 percent from the first quarter to $5.28 billion, the first
decline since the fourth quarter of 2006. Nonperforming assets
fell by $465 million, or 7 percent, in the quarter to $6.1
billion.
