             Chubb Corp. , the insurer of
commercial property and homes, said second-quarter profit fell 6
percent as catastrophe costs increased more than fourfold.  
 Net income  slipped to $518 million, or $1.59 a share, from
$551 million, or $1.54, in the year-earlier period when more
stock was outstanding, the Warren, New Jersey-based insurer said
today in a statement. Operating income, which excludes some
investment results, was $1.41 a share, higher than the $1.39
 average estimate  of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Chubb joins Travelers Cos. in posting a profit decline on
catastrophes. New York-based Travelers’s second-quarter net
income declined to $670 million from $740 million, as costs rose
from natural disasters including storms in Oklahoma, the insurer
said earlier today.  
 “It’s been a rough catastrophe quarter,” said  Joshua Shanker , a New York-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, who has a
“buy” rating on the stock.  
 Chief Executive Officer  John Finnegan  is competing for
business clients as corporations cut jobs and coverage amid
concerns the U.S. economic recovery will stall. The slump in net
income is Chubb’s first year-over-year decline in five quarters.  
 The  stock  advanced 51 cents to $52.20 at 4:03 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. It has climbed 6.1
percent this year, compared with the 8.2 percent gain in the  KBW
Insurance Index .  
 Premium Revenue  
 Premium revenue from property and casualty insurance
slipped about 1 percent to $2.8 billion on a decline in
commercial insurance sales. The insurer posted an increase of
about 4 percent on home and auto coverage to individuals.  
 Industry rates for business coverage slumped 6.4 percent in
the three months ended June 30, widening from a 5.3 percent drop
in prior quarter, according to the Council of Insurance Agents &
Brokers. Demand didn’t increase during the second quarter,
according to 74 percent of brokers surveyed by CIAB.  
 “It’s definitely a buyer’s market,” Council President  Ken Crerar  said in a statement on July 19. “Carriers continue to
fight aggressively for new business.”  
 Chubb earned 9.6 cents for every premium dollar, compared
with 14.1 cents in the year-earlier period, as claims increased
natural disasters. Catastrophes cost the insurer $193 million,
or 38 cents a share, compared with $43 million, or 8 cents, in
the year-earlier period.  
 Insurers’ losses from natural catastrophes, including the
February earthquake in Chile, totaled $22 billion in the first
half of the year, more than double the average for the period
since 2000,  Munich Re  said. Insured losses surpassed the first-
half record from 2008 and compare with $11 billion reported for
the same period last year, the Munich-based company said in a
 statement  on July 7.  
 Investment Gain  
 Chubb reported a $58 million after-tax net realized
investment gain. That compares with an $18 million gain in the
second quarter of 2009. Book value, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, rose 2.5 percent to $49.39 from $48.17 on March 31.  
 Chubb, which invests in corporate and municipal debt,
remained profitable through the credit crisis and recession. The
insurer approved in June a 14 million-share buyback, on top of a
25 million-share program started at the end of last year.  
 Travelers, the insurer added to the Dow Jones Industrial
Average last year, cut its full-profit forecast after second-
quarter results missed analysts’ estimates. Travelers said full-
year operating profit will be $5.20 to $5.45 a share, compared
with the range of $5.20 to $5.55 the insurer gave in May.
