             Iran will tomorrow deliver a letter
to the International Atomic Energy Agency that may lead to
progress toward a swap of nuclear fuel, Iranian Foreign Minister
 Manouchehr Mottaki  said today.  
 The swap of uranium fuel, brokered in May by Turkey and
Brazil, may still go forward despite a United Nations resolution
against Iran, Mottaki told reporters in Istanbul today after
talks with Turkish Foreign Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu  and
Brazilian Foreign Minister  Celso Amorim .  
 U.N. resolutions are a “failed experience,” Mottaki said.
He said Iran was not delaying movement toward the fuel swap,
which would be supervised by the Vienna-based IAEA.  
 Turkey and Brazil brokered an agreement with Iran in May
under which Turkey would receive unprocessed uranium from Iran
and send back smaller amounts of enriched uranium for use in a
medical reactor. The U.S., which says Iran is trying to develop
the ability to build nuclear weapons, opposed the deal and
pushed for tougher sanctions against Iran in the United Nations
Security Council.  
 “We want to solve the Iranian nuclear problem through
diplomacy without increasing tensions in the region,” Davutoglu
said after his meeting with Amorim earlier today.  
 The sanctions were approved on June 9. Turkey and Brazil
opposed the measure.  
 Davutoglu said today the nuclear fuel swap deal was a
“confidence-building measure” on the path to a diplomatic
solution. Amorim said he still believes a diplomatic solution
was possible although the negotiators had a “long road” ahead
of them.
