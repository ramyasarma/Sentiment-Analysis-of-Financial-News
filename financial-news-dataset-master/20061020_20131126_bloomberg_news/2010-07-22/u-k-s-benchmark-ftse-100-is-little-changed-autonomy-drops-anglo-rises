             U.K. stocks  rose for a second day as
a larger-than-forecast increase in retail sales eased concern
that the economic recovery may be faltering.  
 Fashion retailers Burberry Group Plc and Marks & Spencer
Group Plc rose 1.8 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.  Capita
Group Plc  surged 3.8 percent as Chief Executive Officer  Paul Pindar  said the company may win more government contracts.
 Imperial Tobacco Group Plc  slid 2.9 percent after saying
cigarette volumes fell, while Autonomy Corp. lost 9.1 percent as
gross margins declined.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  gained 99.17, or 1.9 percent,
to 5,313.81 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge is 8.8
percent below this year’s high on April 15 amid concern that
growth will be curbed by austerity measures from European
governments. Economic reports in the U.S. and China have also
disappointed investors. The  FTSE All-Share Index  climbed 1.8
percent today and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  rose 1.7 percent.  
 “Retail sales in the U.K. are better than expected and
service and manufacturing growth have accelerated in Europe,”
said  Daniel Redfern , fund manager at Vontobel Asset Management
Ltd. in Zurich today. “Although earnings have been mixed, they
have thus far generally added support to the market, helping
boost investor confidence.”  
 Retailers Climb  
 U.K.  retail sales  in June climbed 0.7 percent compared with
May’s figures, the Office for National Statistics said today in
London. Economists forecast a 0.5 percent gain, according to the
median of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Sales rose
1.3 percent from a year earlier.  
 Non-food retailers rose the most as sales at household
goods shops and electrical goods stores climbed faster than
sales at food retailers. Burberry, the maker of luxury trench
coats, advanced 1.8 percent to 856 pence. Marks & Spencer, the
U.K.’s largest retailer of underwear, climbed 2.4 percent to
353.5 pence.  
 Capita advanced 3.8 percent to 737 pence. The company that
provides a criminal records service for the U.K. Home Office
aims to win more public-sector contracts next year as the
government trims costs, Pindar said.  
 Anglo American Plc rose 2.8 percent to 2,477.5 pence, its
fourth straight gain. Kumba Iron Ore, a unit of Anglo American,
said it had reached an interim agreement to deliver the
steelmaking ingredient to ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd.  
 Imperial Tobacco slid 2.9 percent to 1,853 pence, the
biggest drop since January. The company said cigarette volumes
in the nine months to June fell 4.3 percent, hurt by market
declines in Spain, the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine.  
 Autonomy plummeted 9.1 percent to 1,649 pence, its biggest
drop since November 2008. The U.K.’s second-largest software
company said gross margins declined to 86 percent in the second
quarter from 88 percent a year earlier.
