             Copper declined for the first time
in four days as some investors deemed the climb to a seven-week
high as excessive amid concerns the economic recovery may falter.  
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange declined as much as 1.6 percent to $6,751 a metric ton
before trading at $6,840 at 3:14 p.m. in Singapore. October-
delivery futures on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose as much
as 1.2 percent as China’s stocks climbed for a fourth day,
defying a slump in Asian equities.  
 Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday
that the U.S. economic outlook was “unusually uncertain,”
without offering extra measures to boost growth, sending the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index and other commodities such as oil lower.  
 “Bernanke’s comments bought the issue of a slowdown to the
front of people’s minds,” Wang Feng, an analyst at Minmetals
Futures Co., said from Beijing. “Even if fundamentals seem to
be picking up, metals won’t be spared on such a down day.”  
 Copper reached $6,886 a ton yesterday, the highest level
since June 1, after  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc ., the
world’s biggest publicly traded producer, called the metal’s
outlook “positive.” The continued contraction of LME
 stockpiles , falling yesterday for a 24th day, also helped prices.  
 “We are still optimistic about consumption going
forward,” Liu Xu, an analyst at China International Futures Co.,
said from Shenzhen. “While some of the economic data around the
world hasn’t been ideal, we think this is part of any recovery
process. The issues weighing on the market in the first half of
the year, that is Europe and China, have now abated.”  
 Copper tumbled 11.7 percent in the first six months of the
year on concern that Europe’s fiscal crisis would slow the
global recovery and China’s curbs on lending and property
speculation would cut demand.  
 Aluminum in London was little changed at $2,008.50 a ton,
zinc fell 0.4 percent to $1,910 a ton, and tin lost 0.4 percent
to $18,290 a ton. Lead gained 0.2 percent to $1,869.50 a ton,
and nickel rose 0.2 percent to $19,525 a ton at 3:05 p.m. in
Singapore.
