             South African bonds declined,
raising yields, after the central bank’s monetary policy
committee left the benchmark lending rate at 6.5 percent.  
 The benchmark security due September 2015 retreated 27
cents to 124.34 rand as of 3:19 p.m. in Johannesburg, increasing
the yield by 5 basis points to 7.66 percent.
