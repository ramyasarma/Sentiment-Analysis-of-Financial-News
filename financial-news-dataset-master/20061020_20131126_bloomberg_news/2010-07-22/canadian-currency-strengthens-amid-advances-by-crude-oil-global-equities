             Canada’s currency rose the most in
two weeks against its U.S. counterpart as gains in stocks and
crude oil eased concern that global growth is slowing.  
 The Canadian dollar, nicknamed the loonie, was poised for a
1.9 percent advance this week. The Bank of Canada in a monetary
policy report today said its economic forecast includes
“gradual” interest-rate increases to control inflation in an
economic recovery hampered by slower foreign demand.  
 “You don’t have to look further than equities” to explain
today’s gains in the Canadian dollar,  Matthew Strauss , a senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada, said by phone from
Toronto. “Sentiment has turned into a really strong bullish
risk-rally.”  
 The Canadian dollar gained as much as 1.3 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since July 6, to C$1.0356 per  U.S. dollar 
before trading at C$1.0383 at 4:44 p.m. in Toronto, from
C$1.0491 yesterday, when it reached C$1.0351, the strongest
level since July 15. One Canadian dollar buys 96.31 U.S. cents.  
 The loonie will strengthen to C$1.02 against the U.S.
dollar by the middle of next year, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 35 economists.  
 Canada’s currency briefly pared gains after a government
report showed retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.2 percent to C$36
billion ($34.6 billion) in May on lower receipts at building
material stores and gasoline stations. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News anticipated a 0.4 percent rise, according to the
median of 19 estimates. The drop reflected falling prices, as
sales in volume terms rose 0.4 percent.  
 ‘On the Precipice’  
 The MSCI World Index advanced 2 percent. Futures on crude
oil, Canada’s largest export, climbed 3.3 percent. Canada’s
dollar tends to track movements in stocks and commodity prices.  
 “We’re on the precipice of a bigger move within a couple
of days at most after narrowing the recent trading range,”
 Michael Leavitt , a Montreal-based institutional-derivatives
broker at MF Global Holdings Ltd., said by e-mail, citing
stronger equities and commodity prices. He foresees the Canadian
currency at C$1.080 or parity in 3 weeks or less.  
 Canada’s government bonds fell, with the  yield  on the 10-
year benchmark climbing 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 3.21 percent. The 3.5 percent security due in June
2020 dropped 44 cents to C$102.43.  
 The nation’s government bonds have lost investors 0.48
percent this month, headed for the worst performance since
March, when the debt lost 0.83 percent, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index.  
 ‘Weighed Carefully’  
 Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  raised the benchmark
interest rate July 20 by a quarter-percentage point for a second
month, to 0.75 percent, and said further action will be
“weighed carefully against domestic and global economic
developments.”  
 Carney also cut the nation’s growth forecast by 0.2
percentage point this year and next, to 3.5 percent and 2.9
percent, respectively, and said inflation will stay close to his
2 percent target through 2012. Today’s Bank of Canada report
contained “no real surprises,” RBC’s Strauss said.  
 The loonie, which traded on a one-for-one basis with the
greenback on April 6 for the first time in almost two years, has
gained 4.9 percent this year, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indices, the second-best
performance among its 10 developed world counterparts behind the
yen’s 11 percent increase.
