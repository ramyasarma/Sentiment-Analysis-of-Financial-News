             Stress tests will provide stability
for European lenders and clarity for investors, spurring a rally
in bank debt, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  
 Strategist  Alberto Gallo  says that the cost of insuring
financial company debt with credit-default swaps will drop to
match that of corporate bonds for the first time since January.
The CHART OF THE DAY shows Gallo’s forecast that the Markit
iTraxx Financial Index of swaps and the corporate Markit iTraxx
Europe Index will converge.  
 Corporate bonds are historically more expensive to insure
than bank debt. That relationship was reversed amid concern the
brunt of Europe’s government deficit crisis would be borne by
lenders, with the financial gauge exceeding the investment-grade
index by a record 60 basis points on June 8.  
 “Stress tests and other policies coming through are likely
to increase transparency and stability in the financial
system,” Gallo, who first made the forecast July 13, said in an
interview from New York. “We see the ratio of iTraxx Financial
and iTraxx Europe going to one.”  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros ($12.8 million) of debt
from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.
