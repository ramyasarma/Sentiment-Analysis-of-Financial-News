             Russian grain traders may hesitate
to sign new  export  agreements on concern that a drought might
spur the government to curb outbound shipments, SovEcon said.  
 “Most likely grain traders, especially those representing
international grain companies, will be reluctant to enter new
contracts on fears of possible export restrictions,” the
Moscow-based research center said on its  website  today.  
 Twenty-three crop-growing regions in Russia have declared
emergencies because of the drought, the worst in at least a
decade. Sales to cattle breeders and millers of more than 3
million metric tons of stockpiled feed and food-quality grain in
domestic tenders to help drought-stricken regions will begin
Aug. 4, the Agriculture Ministry said yesterday.  
 The timing of the start of the tenders may signal tight
domestic supplies, SovEcon said. Concern that export curbs might
accompany the sales is “legitimate,” it said.  
 Russia’s government has grain inventories of about 9.5
million tons.
