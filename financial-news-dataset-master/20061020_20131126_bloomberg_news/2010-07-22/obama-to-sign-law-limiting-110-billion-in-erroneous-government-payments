             President  Barack Obama  will sign
legislation today to limit erroneous payments by the government
and announce a new goal of reducing improper payments by $50
billion before 2012, a White House official said.  
 The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act will
help limit improper payments to individuals, organizations and
contractors, according to the administration official. The White
House said that in 2009 a record of almost $110 billion was paid
by the government to the wrong person, in the wrong amount or
for the wrong reasons.  
 The law is intended to create ways to recover improper
payments, allow the recovered funds to be used to improve
financial management, and ensure that agencies comply with the
law.  
 In the past three years the government paid benefits
totaling more than $180 million to approximately 20,000
Americans who had died, according to the statement. More than
$230 million in benefits were paid to about 14,000 fugitives or
people in jail who were ineligible for them, the release said.  
 The legislation is intended to help reduce the budget
deficit, which is projected at a record $1.55 trillion in the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30, up almost 10 percent from last
year’s $1.41 trillion.
