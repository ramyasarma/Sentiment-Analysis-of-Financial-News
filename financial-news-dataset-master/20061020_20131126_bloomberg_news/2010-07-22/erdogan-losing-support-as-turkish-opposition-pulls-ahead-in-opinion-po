             The main Turkish opposition party,
led by  Kemal Kilicdaroglu , has pulled ahead of Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s party, a public opinion poll shows.  
 In this month’s  Sonar Arastirma  poll, 33.5 percent of
respondents said they would vote for Kilicdaroglu’s Republican
People’s Party, as opposed to 31.1 percent for Erdogan’s Justice
and Development Party. The prime minister’s party led in the
Istanbul-based research group’s June poll, backed by 33.4
percent of respondents to 30.25 percent for the Republicans.  
 The Nationalist Action Party would receive 13.8 percent of
the vote, according to Sonar Arastirma’s July 3-10 poll, which
was received by e-mail. The pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy
Party would get 4.5 percent, below the 10 percent threshold
needed for representation in parliament, the poll shows.  
 Elections are planned by July of next year. In the last
elections, in 2007, Erdogan’s Justice and Development won with
47 percent of the vote, to 21 percent for the Republicans.  
 Erdogan received the lowest rating for trust of any Turkish
leader or government branch listed in the poll, at 33 percent.
The most trustworthy was the armed forces, with 78 percent. The
poll also shows 46 percent of respondents had a negative outlook
on the  economy .  
 According to the poll, 77 percent said unemployment was the
country’s most important problem. The latest figures released by
the State Statistics Institute show Turkey’s jobless rate fell
to 12 percent in the three months through May from 14.9 percent
a year earlier.  
 The poll was conducted through in-person interviews with
3,000 people in 16 provinces. The margin of error is 1.7
percentage points, Sonar Arastirma said.
