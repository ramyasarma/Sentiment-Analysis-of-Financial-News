             KenolKobil Ltd. , a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in seven African countries, rose for
the first time in seven trading days after saying the government
ordered the release of fuel stock blocked in a dispute.  
 The shares, which lost 8.2 percent in the previous six
days, gained as much as 0.45 shillings, or 4.5 percent, to 10.50
shillings and traded at 10.3 shillings, an increase of 2.5
percent, as of 11:28 a.m. in Nairobi.  
 Kenya’s Energy Ministry yesterday told Kenya Petroleum
Refineries Ltd. to release fuel stock worth more than 4 billion
shillings ($48.8 million) belonging to the fuel retailer,
KenolKoil Chairman  Jacob Segman  said in an e-mailed statement.
