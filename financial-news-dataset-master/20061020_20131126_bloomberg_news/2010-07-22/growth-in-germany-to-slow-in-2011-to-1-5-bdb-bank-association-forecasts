             German  economic growth  will slow to
around 1.5 percent next year from 2 percent in 2010 as stimulus
programs expire around the world, the  BDB  association of German
banks said.  
 “The first clouds on the economic horizon are emerging,”
the BDB said today in its monthly report, citing the European
Union’s sovereign debt crisis as one source of concern. Even so,
fears that Germany or the world economy might fall back into
recession are “exaggerated,” it said.  
 Stronger domestic demand will help stabilize the economy’s
expansion so long as labor unions resist “excessive” wage
demands and Chancellor  Angela Merkel  holds her line against
government spending, the BDB said.  
 Governments across the 16-nation euro region are cutting
spending to rein in budget deficits, raising concerns in
financial markets. German  investor  confidence declined for a
third month in July, the Mannheim-based  ZEW Center for European
Economic Research  said July 13.
