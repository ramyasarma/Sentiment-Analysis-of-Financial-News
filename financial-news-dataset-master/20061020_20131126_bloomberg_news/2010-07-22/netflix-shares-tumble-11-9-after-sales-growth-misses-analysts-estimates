             Netflix Inc.  fell the most since
October 2008 after the mail-order and online movie-rental
service reported second-quarter sales that missed analysts’
estimates.  
 Netflix slid $16.09, or 13 percent, to $103.56 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading , the biggest drop
since a 16 percent decline on October 7, 2008.  
 The company reported yesterday that second-quarter sales
rose 27 percent to $519.8 million, missing the $525.4 million
average of 22 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Reed Hastings  said Netflix will
support its fast-growing online business by spending more to get
movies and TV shows that can be delivered through the Web to
game consoles, Blu-ray players and  Apple Inc. ’s iPad. Netflix,
which offers DVDs by mail, said 61 percent of subscribers use
its Web service, up from 55 percent in the first quarter.  
 “We’ll feel our way along, increasing the amount of
exclusive content and balancing the cost and the value in terms
of differentiation,” Hastings said in an interview.  
 Net income advanced 34 percent to $43.5 million, or 80
cents a share, from $32.4 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier,
the Los Gatos, California-based company said yesterday in a
statement. That beat the 70-cent average of analysts’ estimates.  
 The company projected third-quarter profit of as much as 74
cents a share on sales of as much as $554 million.  
 Subscriber Growth  
 The combination of streaming and mail-order titles has
helped the company reach 15 million subscribers at June 30, up
42 percent from a year earlier and 7.4 percent from the first
quarter. Netflix raised its subscriber forecast to as many as
18.5 million by year-end, versus an April projection of 17.3
million.  
 The company spent more on acquiring new customers, $24.37
through June 30, compared to $23.88 the same period a year ago
and $21.54 in the first quarter.  
 Hastings is funneling cash into Netflix’s “Watch
Instantly” service as competition heats up with Coinstar Inc.’s
Redbox movie-rental vending machines and alternatives such as
pay-per-view on cable. Netflix service starts at $8.99 a month
for streaming and one DVD at a time. The company said this week
that it plans a video-streaming service in Canada, its first
foray outside the U.S.  
 “Netflix streaming is only going to be as good as the
content they have,” said  Ed Woo , an analyst at Wedbush Morgan
Securities in Los Angeles. “They believe they have a
significant competitive advantage, but they do not have enough
that it’s not wreckable by everyone else trying to get into this
space.”  
 Hulu Threat  
 Emerging competition includes Hulu Inc.’s $9.99 a month
Hulu Plus, which delivers mostly television programs.  
 Netflix said on July 6 that it plans to show films online
owned by Relativity Media LLC. On July 15, Netflix expanded its
agreement with Warner Bros. Home Entertainment to add television
shows for streaming including “Nip/Tuck.”  
 “Distribution is becoming a commodity and you need content
in order to differentiate,” said  Tony Wible , an analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, who recommends selling
Netflix stock. “There are many players seeking that same
content, which will result in inflationary pressure.”  
 Earnings for the full year will be $2.58 to $2.86 a share,
up from a previous projection of $2.41 to $2.63 a share, on an
unchanged sales forecast of as much as $2.16 billion, the
company said.
