             Investors should sell the euro
against the dollar ahead of the release of European bank stress
tests tomorrow, targeting a “dip” to $1.26, according to Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 “People wouldn’t want to go long on the euro into the
stress tests,”  Paul Robson , a senior foreign-exchange
strategist at RBS, said today in a telephone interview from
London. “Expect it to trade weakly into the results, to trade
weakly afterwards and significantly lower over the next six
months.”  
 The euro traded at $1.2917 against the dollar as of 3:22
p.m. in London, down from the two-month high of $1.3029 earlier
this week.  
 European regulators are examining the strength of 91 banks
to determine if they can survive potential losses on sovereign-
bond holdings.  
 There’s “uncertainty over the timing of the announcement”
as well as the potential for a “communication error” on the
part of the European regulators, said Robson. “This isn’t going
to be a defining moment of the euro-area crisis. We are in the
slow burn.”
