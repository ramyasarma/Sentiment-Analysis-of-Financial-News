             Caterpillar Inc., the world’s
largest maker of construction equipment, raised its full-year
earnings forecast and posted second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates as demand rose in developing countries.  
 Full-year earnings may be $3.15 to $3.85 a share, more than
its April forecast of $2.50 to $3.25, the Peoria, Illinois-based
company said in a statement today. The average estimate was
$3.27 in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Second-quarter profit
was $1.09 a share, beating the 84-cent estimate.  
 “The fact that they raised the year by significantly more
than the quarterly beat is something we like to see,” Stephen
Volkmann, an analyst for Jefferies & Co. in New York, said in an
interview. “The key takeaway is that the company beat on
margins, they are raising the forecast on margins. That’s what
was really missing the last cycle.”  
 Caterpillar, led by new Chief Executive Officer Doug
Oberhelman, is investing almost $700 million to make hydraulic
shovels and expand truck output to meet Asian and Russian
demand. Mining companies are buying equipment as commodities use
rises in China and the U.S. economy emerges from recession.  
 Net income rose 91 percent to $707 million from $371
million a year earlier and sales increased 31 percent to $10.4
billion. Annual sales may be $39 billion to $42 billion, with
the low end raised $1 billion since April, the company said.  
 Caterpillar rose 28 cents to $67.15 at 9:40 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares climbed 17
percent this year before today.  
 Range of Products  
 Oberhelman, 57, who took over as CEO from Jim Owens on July
1, is working to increase the range of Caterpillar’s products.
The company said June 1 it agreed to buy locomotive manufacturer
Electro-Motive Diesel for $820 million from Berkshire Partners
LLC and Greenbriar Equity Group LLC to expand its rail and
transit units.  
 Caterpillar expects to increase production in the second
half, Oberhelman said in the statement.  
 Sales in Caterpillar’s machines business, which makes
excavators and loaders, rose 55 percent to $6.73 billion. Demand
was aided by low interest rates, economic recovery in most
countries, increased construction in some nations and higher
metals and energy prices, the company said.  
 Engine sales rose 2.5 percent to $2.99 billion, Caterpillar
said. Financial-product revenue fell 4.9 percent to $686
million, the company said.  
 Competitor Komatsu  
 Japan’s Komatsu Ltd., Caterpillar’s largest competitor,
this month raised its first-half profit forecast 41 percent and
said it plans to double production this financial year to meet
Chinese and Indonesian demand.  
 “Most of the investment community expected a substantial
beat and raise given what Komatsu and other companies have done
recently,” Larry De Maria, an analyst for Sterne Agee & Leach
Inc. in New York, said in an interview today. An important
element is the company said it expects suppliers will be able to
support higher production in this year’s second half, he said.  
 Increased concern about the strength of the economic
recovery may make central bankers more wary about tightening
monetary policy, Caterpillar said today. The company no longer
predicts policy makers will raise interest rates in the U.S. or
euro zone.
