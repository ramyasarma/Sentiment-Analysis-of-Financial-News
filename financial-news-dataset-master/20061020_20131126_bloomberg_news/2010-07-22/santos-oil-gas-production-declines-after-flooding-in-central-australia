             Santos Ltd. , Australia’s third-
largest oil and gas producer, reported an 11 percent decline in
second-quarter output as floods in central Australia disrupted
operations in the Cooper Basin.  
 Production in the three months ended June 30 dropped to
11.9 million barrels of oil equivalent from 13.4 million barrels
a year earlier, Adelaide-based Santos said in a statement today
to the Australian stock exchange. Santos maintained its 2010
production forecast of 49 million to 52 million barrels.  
 “Recovery is well underway and all drilling rigs are now
back in operation” after the floods, the Australian oil and gas
producer said. Even so, “the company’s operations in the Cooper
Basin would continue to be impacted for several months,” Chief
Executive Officer  David Knox  said.  
 Santos  shares  fell 0.2 percent to A$13.72 at 10:10 a.m. in
Sydney trading. The S&P/ASX 200 Index was 0.4 percent lower.  
 Sales rose 20 percent to A$580 million in the quarter from
A$484 million a year earlier. UBS AG had expected Santos to
post revenue of about A$484 million in the quarter, according to
a July 19 report by Melbourne-based analyst  Gordon Ramsay .  
 Santos, which is planning the Gladstone liquefied natural
gas project in Queensland state, said the venture is continuing
to advance toward a final investment decision later in 2010.  
 “GLNG remains in detailed discussions with a number of
parties in relation to potential LNG sales, equity in the
project and collaboration between projects,” Knox said.
