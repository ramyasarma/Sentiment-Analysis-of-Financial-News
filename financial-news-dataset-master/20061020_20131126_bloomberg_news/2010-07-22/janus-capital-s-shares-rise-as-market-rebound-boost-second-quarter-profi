             Janus Capital Group Inc. , owner of
the Janus, Intech and Perkins funds, rose the most in 14 months
in New York trading after fund withdrawals eased in the second
quarter and earnings beat analysts’ estimates.  
 Net outflows from Janus’s Intech unit, a combined $9.2
billion in the previous three quarters, slowed to $1.5 billion,
the Denver-based company said today in a statement. Per-share
earnings of 17 cents topped the 14-cent average estimate of 16
analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  
 “Flows were better than expected, particularly at Intech,
where real performance has improved,”  Mark Lane , an analyst at
William Blair & Co. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  
 Janus’s earnings got a boost from higher fund balances
compared with a year ago, lifting management fees paid by
clients. The  MSCI AC World Index  of stocks climbed 9.5 percent
in the year ended June 30. About 90 percent of the company’s
mutual-fund assets are in equities.  
 Janus rose $1.12, or 12 percent, to $10.59 at 4:03 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was the biggest
gain since May 2009. Janus has lost 21 percent this year,
compared with the 8.7 percent decline by the Standard & Poor’s
index of 15 asset managers and custody banks.  
 Net income increased 91 percent to $30.2 million from $15.8
million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 25
percent to $249.3 million, driven by a 30 percent jump in
investment-management fees.  
 Expenses increased 23 percent to $187.9 million, as
employee compensation and benefits, including long-term
incentives, rose 25 percent. Marketing and distribution costs
rose 51 percent to $50.8 million reflecting Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Weil  aim to beef up retail sales through
intermediaries.  
 Yearly Increase  
 Assets under management increased 11 percent from a year
earlier to $147.2 billion. During the second quarter, assets
fell 11 percent with net withdrawals of $1.3 billion.  
 Investors took out $1 billion from traditional equity funds
in the quarter, including the loss of $1.8 billion when one
large investor pulled out.  
 Bond funds, which accounted for $9.2 billion as of June 30,
or 6 percent of total assets, added $1.2 billion. Weil, 47,
plans to introduce new fixed-income products later this year. He
joined Janus in February from Newport Beach, California-based
Pacific Investment Management Co., the second-biggest manager of
bonds behind  BlackRock Inc .
