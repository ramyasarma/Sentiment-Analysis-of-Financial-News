             Outokumpu Oyj , a stainless-steel
producer in Finland, fell the most in more than two months in
Helsinki trading after second-quarter earnings missed analyst
estimates.  
 Outokumpu  dropped as much as 6.3 percent to 12.85 euros,
the biggest decline since May 4, and traded at 12.99 euros as of
11 a.m. local time. Shares in the Espoo, Finland-based company
have slipped 2 percent this year, giving it a market value of
2.38 billion euros ($3.05 billion).  
 While demand for Outokumpu’s so-called standard grades
continues to climb, use of special grades is still “lagging,”
the company said in an earnings statement today. The current
holiday season and lower nickel prices are causing “hesitance”
among stainless-steel distributors to place orders, it said.  
 Operating profit was 71 million euros in the quarter,
missing an average  analyst estimate  of 86.3 million euros. Last
year, Outokumpu posted an operating loss of 94 million euros.  
 The seasonal slowdown in demand and annual maintenance
halts at the company’s mills will result in a decline of 10
percent to 20 percent in stainless-steel delivery volumes in the
third quarter compared with the second, Outokumpu said. “The
underlying operational result in the third quarter is expected
to be somewhat negative,” it said.  
 The company posted net income of 44 million euros in the
second quarter, compared with an 87 million-euro net loss a year
earlier.
