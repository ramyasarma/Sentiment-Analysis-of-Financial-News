             Airbus SAS , the world’s largest
maker of commercial aircraft, raised its order target for this
year to more than 400 jets, as leasing companies return to the
market and global travel rebounds.  
 Toulouse-based Airbus won firm orders for 133 aircraft
valued at more than $13 billion, and commitments for another 122
jets, bringing the total value of accords at the Farnborough Air
Show to $28 billion, the company said at the show today.  
 “This was a good air show for us and good for the
industry” Airbus Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders  said at a
briefing. “We signed more contracts than we anticipated.”  
 Sales Chief  John Leahy  said “the recession is definitely
over” as global traffic routes fill up and leasing companies
resume purchases. Aircraft lessors accounted for the bulk of
firm deals at Farnborough, with Air Lease Corp. CEO  Steven Udvar-Hazy  buying 51 Airbus single-aisle jets. Airbus
leapfrogged Boeing Co. in 2003 as the largest jet manufacturer.  
 Boeing  said at the show that it raised its internal order
forecast “significantly” for this year from what the Chicago-
based company had predicted at the start of 2010. The company
has lifted the prediction twice this year so far.  
 Airbus had previously targeted as many as 300 orders for
2010, and Leahy said last week he aimed to double the number of
orders pulled in so far this year during the show.  
 Enders said the company will achieve its production target
of more than 20 A380 superjumbos this year, and that Airbus aims
to sign up one more customer for the jet in 2010. The aircraft
is operated by five airlines to date, including Air France KLM
Group and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. Emirates is the largest buyer
of the plane, with 90 in total on order.
