             Medco Health Solutions Inc.  plunged
the most in 21 months in New York trading as investors
questioned the pace at which the company will benefit from
patent expirations on drugs such as  Pfizer Inc.’s  Lipitor.  
 Shares of Medco, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager
by revenue, fell $3.14, or 5.9 percent, to $50.19 at 3:24 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier, the
Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company declined as much as 10
percent, its biggest intraday drop since October 2008.  
 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  David Snow  said 2011
will be a “lighter year” with less contribution from new
generic drugs. Multiple companies sell generic medicines, which
are a cheaper alternative to brand-name therapies and are more
profitable for drug-benefit managers. Medco earnings per share
excluding some items are projected to be $3.34 this year and
$3.97 in 2011, according to the average  estimate  of 28 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “What worried people is that in 2011, there’s technically
$14 billion worth of branded drug that’s scheduled to go
generic, but 2011 is actually a trough in the wave of new
generics,” Snow said today in a telephone interview. “The only
big drug that will come out in 2011 is Lipitor and it doesn’t
come out until Nov. 20, which means it’s really more of a 2012
benefit.”  
 Lipitor Sales  
 Sales of the cholesterol medicine Lipitor, the world’s
best-selling prescription drug, totaled $11.4 billion last year.
In June 2008, New York-based Pfizer and Punjab, India-based
Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. agreed to keep copies of Lipitor off
the U.S. market an extra 20 months.  
 About $30 billion dollars of branded drugs will go generic
in 2012, making that year the biggest ever for generic-drug
introductions, Snow said.  
 As for next year’s performance, “it’s too early to talk
about 2011,” said Snow said today on a conference call with
investors. “We are just starting our operating plan process in
detail now, so we will give an update on that on the third-
quarter call.”  
 The omission of a 2011  forecast  disappointed investors,
said  David Shove , an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York.  
 “There was some expectation that they would issue guidance
for 2011 that was bullish,” Shove said in a telephone
interview. “Investors are nervous about 2011 because the
generic pipeline is weak, especially in the first part of the
year. There aren’t any large patent expirations until later next
year.”  
 Investors may also be worried about the competitive pricing
environment for pharmacy benefit managers, Shove said.  
 Medco said second-quarter  net income  rose 14 percent to
$356.9 million, or 77 cents a share, from $312.1 million, or 64
cents. Revenue increased 9.9 percent, to $16.4 billion.
