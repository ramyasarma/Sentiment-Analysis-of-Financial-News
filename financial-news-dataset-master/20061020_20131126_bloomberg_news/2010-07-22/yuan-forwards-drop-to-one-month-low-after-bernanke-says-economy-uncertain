             Yuan forwards dropped to the weakest
level in a month after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the economic outlook is “unusually uncertain,” prompting
investors to seek safety in the dollar.  
 Central bankers “remain prepared to take further policy
actions” to aid growth, Bernanke said yesterday in testimony to
the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. Fed policy makers trimmed
their forecasts for U.S. growth and raised unemployment
projections at their June 22-23 meeting. China’s economy
expanded at a slower pace last quarter and inflation cooled.  
 “The weaker yuan forwards reflect bearish sentiment about
the economic outlook in both the U.S. and China,” said  Irene Cheung , director of local-markets trading at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in Singapore. “Investors were cautious and
bought back the dollar to reduce risks.”  
 The 12-month non-deliverable forward declined 0.2 percent
to 6.7175 per dollar as of 10:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, the weakest
level since June 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
has dropped 0.9 percent in a six-day decline. The contracts
reflected bets the currency will strengthen 0.9 percent from the
spot rate of 6.7790, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 China’s central bank set the yuan’s reference rate for
daily trading 0.1 percent lower at 6.7859 per dollar today, the
weakest this month. The currency has gained 0.7 percent since
the central bank ended a two-year dollar peg on June 19 after
holding the currency stable during the global financial crisis.  
 Slower Growth  
 A government report issued on July 15 showed the economy
expanded 10.3 percent in the second quarter, slowing from growth
of 11.9 percent in the previous three months. Inflation cooled
to 2.9 percent in June from 3.1 percent in the previous month.  
 The U.S.  initial jobless  claims rose to 445,000 last week
from 429,000 in the prior period, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before a Labor Department report today. The National
Association of Realtors will say  sales  of previously owned homes
fell in June by the most this year, a separate survey showed.  
 The People’s Bank of China sold 80 billion yuan ($11.8
billion) in three-month bills at a  yield  of 1.5704 percent in
open-market operations, unchanged for a fourth straight sale.
