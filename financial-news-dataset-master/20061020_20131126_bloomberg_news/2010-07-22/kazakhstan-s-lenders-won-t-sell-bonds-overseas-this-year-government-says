             Kazakhstan’s banks won’t sell any
bonds abroad this year, removing the need for the government to
create a benchmark for its fixed-income markets by selling debt
on international capital markets, the Finance Ministry said.  
 The ministry said July 20 it canceled plans to sell as much
as $750 million of bonds to investors outside its borders this
year after obtaining a $1 billion loan from a World Bank unit.  
 BTA Bank, Alliance Bank, AO Astana Finance and Temirbank,
then controlled by BTA, defaulted last year, leaving about $20
billion in debt to be restructured. State-controlled Alliance
and Temirbank have completed their debt restructuring efforts,
and BTA struck a deal with creditors in May.  
 Kazakhstan “is studying the possibility of selling Islamic
bonds,” Finance Ministry spokeswoman Anna Zhekenova said by
telephone from Astana today, without elaborating.
