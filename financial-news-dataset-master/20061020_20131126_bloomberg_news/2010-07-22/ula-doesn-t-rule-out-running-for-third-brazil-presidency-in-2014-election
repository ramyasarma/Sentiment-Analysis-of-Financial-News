             Brazilian President  Luiz Inacio Lula 
da Silva said yesterday he doesn’t rule out running again for
president in the 2014 elections.  
 Lula, when asked yesterday in an interview with TV Record
about whether he would run again in 2014 said that “in
politics, we can never say no.”  
 Lula, who took power in 2003 and was reelected in 2006, is
barred by Brazil’s constitution from seeking a third consecutive
term.  
 His chosen successor, former Cabinet Chief  Dilma Rousseff ,
was supported by 39 percent of those surveyed in an Ibope poll
taken June 27-30, tied with former Sao Paulo Governor  Jose Serra . The nationwide poll of 2,002 people has a 2 percentage-
point margin of error. Lula’s approval rating stands at a record
85 percent, according to Ibope.
