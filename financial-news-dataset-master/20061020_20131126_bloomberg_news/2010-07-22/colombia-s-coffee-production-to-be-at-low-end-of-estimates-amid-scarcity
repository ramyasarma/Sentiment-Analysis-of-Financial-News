             Colombian coffee production will
fall to the lower end of forecasts this year amid “scarcity”
that has buoyed prices, the head of the nation’s growers
federation said.  
 Growers will harvest between 10 million and 10.5 million
bags,  Luis Genaro , chief executive officer of  Colombia’s
National Federation of Coffee Growers , said today in Bogota. The
group last month forecast a crop of between 10 million and 11
million bags.  
 Coffee has rallied 19 percent this year and may maintain
gains after global stockpiles fell to the lowest level in years
and consumption grew, Genaro said. A premium paid for Colombian
arabica beans over New York futures also may hold, he said. The
differential is 66.95 cents, according to Bloomberg data.  
 “There has been relative scarcity of Colombian beans and
relative scarcity of mild coffee worldwide,” he said.  
 Colombian growers have “zero” inventories of coffee, he
said. Production in the first six months of the year shrank to
4.04 million bags from 4.24 million bags a year earlier. Each
bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  
 Growers aim to produce 14 million bags in 2015 by replacing
older plants, according to Genaro.  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery gained 4.4 cents, or
2.8 percent, to $1.617 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
