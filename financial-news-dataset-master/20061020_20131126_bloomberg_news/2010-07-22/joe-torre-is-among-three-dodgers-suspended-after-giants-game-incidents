             Los Angeles Dodgers manager  Joe Torre  missed last night’s 2-0 win over the San Francisco Giants
after serving a one-game suspension.  
 Hitting coach  Don Mattingly  took over the manager’s duties
as Torre watched the game at Dodgers Stadium in General Manager
 Ned Colletti ’s box.  
 Casey Blake  hit a home run in the second inning and had a
run-scoring single in the eighth to snap a six-game losing
streak for the Dodgers.  
 Los Angeles pitcher  Chad Billingsley  gave up five hits as
he registered his first complete game of the season.  
 Torre was suspended and fined by Major League Baseball
yesterday after being ejected in the seventh inning of a 7-5
loss to the Giants two days ago. Pitcher  Clayton Kershaw , who
was ejected along with Torre, also got a ban, as did bench coach
 Bob Schaefer .  
 Torre and Kershaw were ejected after Kershaw hit Giants
center fielder  Aaron Rowand  with a pitch. Two innings earlier,
both teams were warned after Giants starter  Tim Lincecum  hit Los
Angeles center fielder  Matt Kemp  with a pitch.  
 Kershaw, who was also fined, will appeal his five-game ban,
which means the sanction will be held off until the process is
complete.  
 Schaefer was also fined and ordered to miss one game, which
he’s scheduled to do tonight when the Dodgers host the New York
Mets.
