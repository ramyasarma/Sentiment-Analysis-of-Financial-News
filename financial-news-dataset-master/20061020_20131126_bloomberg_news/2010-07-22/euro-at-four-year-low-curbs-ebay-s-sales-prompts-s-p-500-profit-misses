             EBay Inc. ,  International Business
Machines Corp.  and  Delta Air Lines Inc.  all pinned part of the
blame for disappointing 2010 forecasts or second-quarter sales
on the same culprit: the weakened euro.  
 The European currency averaged $1.27 in the quarter, the
lowest in more than four years, hurting sales at companies from
technology businesses to jet-engine manufacturers. So far in
this earnings cycle, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies are
trailing analysts’ profit estimates at almost twice the rate of
the first quarter, Bloomberg data show.  
 “It’s one of these things that oftentimes companies take
their eyes off of,” said  Peter Sorrentino , a senior portfolio
manager for Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, which
manages $13.3 billion. “It’s something that they don’t
typically focus on until it reaches up and bites them.”  
 The euro’s decline and other currency fluctuations will
lower full-year revenue as much as $250 million at EBay, the San
Jose, California-based company said yesterday. IBM, the Armonk,
New York-based computer-services company, said its second-
quarter sales were slashed by $500 million, and Atlanta-based
Delta, the world’s largest carrier, posted a $25 million charge.  
 The euro may drop to $1.20 by the end of this quarter, the
median of 46 estimates compiled by Bloomberg, making U.S.
exports more costly and trimming overseas sales when euro-
denominated figures are converted to dollars. The currency,
which fell amid concern Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis may slow
growth, may remain at $1.20 in the fourth quarter and finish
next year at about $1.22, analysts project.  
 Sales From Europe  
 About 35 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index get
more than 10 percent of sales from Europe, according to their
disclosures, and many don’t fully hedge against adverse effects
from currency exchange because it’s too expensive or they expect
to benefit from fluctuations.  
 EBay, the e-commerce site owner that gets more revenue from
outside the U.S. than any other large Internet company including
Amazon.com Inc., Google Inc. and Yahoo! Inc., said the weakening
European currency will shave off as much as 11 cents from 2010
earnings per share.  
 “Once we announce our guidance for a quarter, we hedge
within the quarter,” EBay Chief Executive Officer  John Donahoe 
said in an interview. “To the extent the dollar or exchange
rates move over a year, we can’t control it and we don’t try to
get into the game of guessing where they’re going.”  
 Negative Surprises  
 Three weeks after the second quarter ended, 16 percent of
reporting S&P 500 members had posted lower per-share profit than
analysts estimated, up from 8.6 percent in the same period after
the first quarter, according to Bloomberg data. S&P companies
still have reported profit growth of 61 percent.  
 So-called negative surprises were reported by 17 of the 110
S&P 500 members that announced second-quarter earnings through
yesterday, compared with 10 of 116 companies reporting first-
quarter earnings through April 21.  
 Gilead Sciences Inc. , the world’s largest maker of AIDS
drugs, said fluctuations in currency including the euro reduced
pretax earnings by $19.5 million compared with the year-earlier
period. The Foster City, California-based company reduced its
full-year product sales forecast by $100 million, to $7.3
billion to $7.4 billion, and its adjusted second-quarter profit
of 85 cents a share trailed the 87-cent estimate from analysts.  
 Like EBay, some companies projected larger impacts on their
earnings in the second half of the year than in the past three
months. EBay topped both profit and sales estimates yesterday.  
 ‘Trend of Urgency’  
 Health-product manufacturer  Johnson & Johnson’s  full-year
profit would be cut about 5 cents a share, to $4.65 to $4.75, by
currency fluctuations if the euro remained at $1.29, compared
with $1.35 earlier in the year, Chief Financial Officer  Dominic Caruso  said on a July 20 conference call about the New
Brunswick, New Jersey-based company’s earnings.  
 Wolfgang Koester , who leads Fireapps Inc., said calls to
his currency-strategy business have increased fivefold in the
past six months, as companies race to figure out how to diminish
the impact of exchange-rate fluctuations.  
 “We used to just get foreign-exchange managers calling
us,” said Koester, whose Scottsdale, Arizona-based company
makes technology to manage financial risk. “Today, it’s the
treasurer, the CFO or sometimes even the CEO calling us
directly. There’s a trend of urgency.”  
 The euro’s volatility “encourages more aggressive hedging
than we’ve seen in the past few years,” said  Kathy Lien ,
director of currency research at online currency trader GFT
Forex in New York.  
 Long-Term Outlook  
 Long-term hedging is too costly for  EMC Corp. , the world’s
biggest maker of storage computers, Chief Financial Officer
 David Goulden  said yesterday in an interview. The company
typically hedges within the quarter.  
 EMC projects currency fluctuation will reduce revenue for
the second half of the year by $225 million. That would lower
sales for the full year by $150 million, compared with an April
forecast that exchange rates would have no impact.  
 Like EBay, EMC, based in Hopkinton, Massachusetts,
typically hedges within a quarter.  
 “We’re in the business of IT, not currency speculation,”
Goulden said. “It’s very expensive, plus kind of risky as well.
Who knows which way it’s going to go?”  
 The euro will strengthen by the end of the year after
weakening further this quarter, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
last week.  
 United Technologies Corp.  officially lowered the top of its
full-year sales  forecast  yesterday to $54 billion, a decrease of
$1 billion, because of the euro’s decline.  
 ‘No Room for Error’  
 The Hartford, Connecticut-based maker of Pratt & Whitney
jet engines and Otis elevators expects “about 8 cents of
headwind year-over-year in the second half,” Chief Financial
Officer  Greg Hayes  said on a conference call to discuss the
company’s second-quarter earnings.  
 United Technologies now expects the euro to average $1.25
in the second half of 2010, down from a projection of $1.35
earlier this year and $1.48 at the start of 2010.  
 Higher orders in units including Carrier air conditioners
and for Otis elevator equipment would help the company meet the
top end of its full-year profit forecast, even if the euro
averaged $1.20, Hayes said in June.  
 “The problem with a $1.20 euro is that it leaves us no
contingency and no room for error,” Hayes said then.
“Everything else has to kind of play out as we expect.”
