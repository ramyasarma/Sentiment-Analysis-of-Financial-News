             United Parcel Service Inc.  jumped
the most in two months after the world’s largest package-
delivery company raised its annual profit forecast and said the
U.S. economy will continue to recover.  
 Profit for 2010 will be as much as $3.45 a share from a
previous maximum of $3.30, Atlanta-based UPS said today in a
statement. Analysts had projected $3.28 a share, on average, in
a Bloomberg survey.  
 UPS is benefiting from a jump in shipments in Asia and
Europe, and said volumes in the U.S. will continue to improve as
industrial production outpaces economic growth in the second
half. UPS and  FedEx Corp.  are considered economic bellwethers
because they deliver goods ranging from clothing to
pharmaceuticals and industrial parts.  
 “Investors are worried about a double-dip recession, and
UPS essentially said today that that isn’t going to happen,”
said  Art Hatfield , an analyst at Morgan Keegan & Co. in Memphis,
Tennessee, who rates the shares “outperform.” “UPS said the
recovery is going to be slow and uneven, but they didn’t say
it’s going to reverse itself, and that’s what everyone has been
dying to hear.”  
 UPS climbed $3.14, or 5.2 percent, to $63.15 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the biggest increase
since May 10. The shares have gained 10 percent this year.  
 Net Income  
 Net income  jumped 90 percent to $845 million, or 84 cents a
share, exceeding the 75-cent average of 10 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. A year earlier, profit was $445 million,
or 44 cents. Revenue rose 13 percent to $12.2 billion.  
 Domestic shipments will continue to grow roughly in line
with U.S. gross domestic product, and exports from Europe and
Asia will continue to improve, even if the pace “moderates”
somewhat in the second half of this year, executives said.  
 “Despite the anticipated slow pace of the U.S. recovery
and a cautious outlook for Europe, we are confident in our
ability to grow the business and improve profits,” Chief
Financial Officer  Kurt Kuehn  said in the statement.  
 UPS said small-package volume in the U.S. rose 1.2 percent
in the second quarter, the best results for that unit in 2 1/2
years, as businesses restocked inventories and consumers bought
more goods such as electronics and apparel.  
 Average price per domestic package jumped 5.8 percent to $9
on higher rates and fuel surcharges. The unit accounts for about
 60 percent of UPS’s sales .  
 International shipments surged 20 percent led by demand in
Asia, while prices rose 2.3 percent to $18.93, on average.
