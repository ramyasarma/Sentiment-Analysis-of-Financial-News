             U.S. frozen-pork stockpiles
were 29 percent smaller at the end of June than a year
earlier, as shrinking herds led to a decline in production
and exports of the meat rebounded.  
 Warehouses held 410.1 million pounds of pork on June
30, down from 577.9 million a year earlier, when supplies
were the highest on record for the date, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today in a report.
Inventories fell 8.1 percent from the end of May.  
 U.S. meatpackers may have produced 1.5 percent less
pork in June than a year earlier after farmers cut hog
herds, said  Bob Brown , an independent market analyst in
Edmond, Oklahoma. The USDA will release monthly pork-
production figures tomorrow. U.S. exports of the meat
jumped 18 percent in May from a year earlier, according to
government data.  
 “You’re getting to a time when demand is good and
fresh supplies are the lowest they’ve been in a while,”
Brown said. “The only place to turn is to what’s left in
the freezer, which is getting pretty skimpy too.”  
 Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.825 cent, or
1.1 percent, to 76.45 a pound at 12:48 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the most-active contract
jumped 30 percent in the past year.  
 U.S. inventories of pork bellies, which are cured and
sliced to make bacon, plunged 54 percent from a year
earlier to 35.4 million pounds, according to today’s
report. Warehouse supplies of ham fell 2.7 percent to 113.4
million pounds.  
 Chicken-meat stockpiles at the end of June were 2.3
percent larger than a year earlier at 669 million pounds,
the USDA said. Beef inventories shrank 14 percent to 375.3
million pounds.
