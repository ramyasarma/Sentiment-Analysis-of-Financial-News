             American Express Co. , the biggest
credit-card issuer by purchases, said second-quarter profit
tripled as consumers spent more and fewer borrowers defaulted.  
 Net income from continuing operations climbed to
$1.02 billion, or 84 cents a diluted share, from $342 million,
or 9 cents, in the same period a year earlier, New York-based
AmEx said today in a statement. The average  estimate  of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 77 cents.  
 AmEx, led by Chief Executive Officer  Kenneth I. Chenault ,
has posted the industry’s lowest write-off rates and some of the
fastest earnings growth as the recession eased. Net revenue
climbed 13 percent during the quarter to $6.86 billion. The
company targets affluent consumers who have led the spending
rebound.  
 “Improved credit indicators continued the year-long trend
that began last spring,” Chenault, 59, said in the statement.
“Our  net income  and billed business are back at, or near, their
pre-recession levels.”  
 Total card spending rose 16 percent to $175.3 billion.
Individuals spent an average of $3,288, an increase of
21 percent from a year earlier, when AmEx had fewer cards
outstanding. AmEx set aside $652 million for future loan losses,
59 percent less than the year-ago quarter, and released
$506 million from loss reserves.  
 Overdue Payments  
 In June, AmEx had the lowest delinquency rate among the six
biggest U.S. credit-card issuers. Loans at least 30 days
overdue, a leading indicator for write-offs, fell to 2.7
percent. Declining late payments may allow lenders to buttress
profit by reducing reserves for future loan losses.  
 AmEx, 2009’s  top performer  in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, rose $2.04, or 5 percent, to $43.19 as of 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Results were released
after the market closed, and the shares slid 1.6 percent at
4:37 p.m. in extended New York trading.  
 That’s better than  Visa Inc.  and  MasterCard Inc.,  the
world’s biggest payment networks, which came under pressure this
year as Congress put caps on debit-card “swipe” fees charged
to merchants. AmEx is insulated from the legislation backed by
U.S. Senator  Richard Durbin , the Illinois Democrat and majority
whip, because the company doesn’t issue signature debit cards or
process debit transactions.  
 “American Express is largely unscathed by Durbin,”
Citigroup Inc. analyst  Donald Fandetti  said in a July 20
research note.
