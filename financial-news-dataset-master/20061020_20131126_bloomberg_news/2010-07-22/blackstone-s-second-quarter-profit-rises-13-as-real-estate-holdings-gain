             Blackstone Group LP , the world’s
biggest buyout firm, said second-quarter earnings rose 13
percent as the value of real-estate holdings and private-equity
investments gained.  
 Profit, excluding some costs tied to the firm’s 2007
initial public offering, increased to $205.2 million, or 18
cents a share, from $180.8 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier,
the New York-based firm said today in a statement. Earnings beat
the 16-cent average estimate of nine analysts in a  Bloomberg
survey .  
 The firm’s private-equity holdings gained 3 percent in the
quarter as the firm benefited from stabilizing real estate and
buyout markets that allowed it to mark up and sell assets.
Blackstone raised a new buyout fund totaling $13.5 billion,
President  Tony James  said on a conference call.  
 “We continue to see signs of improvement in the
fundamentals across our portfolio,” Blackstone Chairman  Stephen Schwarzman  said in the statement.  
 Blackstone rose 43 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $10.74 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, paring losses
this year to 18 percent. The stock is  trading  at about a third
of its $31-a-share IPO price.  
 Blackstone highlights economic net income as its main
measure of profit. The gauge excludes compensation costs tied to
the IPO, which will result in net losses in its first five years
as a public company.  
 Performance Fees  
 The second-quarter net loss widened to $193.3 million from
$164.3 million a year earlier. The firm had $24 million in
negative unrealized performance fees in its private-equity
business in the quarter, compared with a positive $97.2 million
a year earlier.  
 “Adverse global securities markets performance had a
negative impact on performance fees in the second quarter,”
Schwarzman said.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 12 percent in the
three months through June and is down 4 percent since the start
of the year.  
 Industrywide, buyouts have more than tripled from last year
to $40.7 billion so far this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The volume is still less than a 10th of the $414
billion announced in the same period three years ago, when the
three-year buyout boom peaked.  
 ‘Bigger Deals’  
 “Everyone is more focused on the firm’s views on whether
it can monetize investments over the next year and finance
bigger deals,”  Roger Freeman , an analyst at Barclays Capital in
New York who rates the stock “neutral” and has a $17-a-share
price target, said in a telephone interview before results were
released.  
 Net fee-related earnings from operations rose 24 percent to
$107.9 million. The firm declared a quarterly dividend of 10
cents a share.  
 Fee-earning assets under management rose 8 percent to
$101.4 billion, driven by a 17 percent gain in the credit and
marketable alternatives business, which houses Blackstone’s fund
of hedge funds business.  
 Fee-related earnings in that unit, Blackstone’s largest by
assets under management, rose 37 percent to $34.6 million as
management fees increased.
