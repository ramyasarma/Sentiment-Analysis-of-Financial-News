             Cotton futures rose to a three-week
high as inventories plunged to the lowest level since 2004 in
the U.S., the world’s largest exporter. Orange juice also
gained.  
 Since June 2, cotton  inventories  monitored by ICE Futures
U.S. have plummeted 95 percent to 53,315 bales, the lowest level
since December 2004, exchange data show. Stockpiles held through
a government loan program for farmers totaled 743,264  bales  as
of July 20. Prices have jumped 5.1 percent since reaching a
five-month low on July 20.  
 “We only have about 800,000 bales available, and this
cotton needs to satisfy the mill demand until the new cotton is
ready in late September,” said  John Flanagan , the president of
Flanagan Trading Corp. in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina.
“Between now and December, there’s nothing holding the prices
of cotton back, except the reluctance of buyers to pay up.”  
 Cotton for December delivery rose 0.21 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 76.7 cents a pound on ICE in New York. Earlier, the
price touched 76.94, the highest level for the most-active
contract since July 1.  
 Global demand  is forecast to grow to 116.55 million bales
for the marketing year that ends July 31, up 6 percent from a
year earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on July 9.
A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  
 China, the biggest consumer, will raise its import  quota 
for the fiber by almost 1 million tons and sell more from its
stockpiles to relieve a domestic shortfall, the China Cotton
Association said June 25. The State Council has approved
additional import quotas, bringing the total for 2010 to about
3.6 million tons, the association said. The government also
plans to sell 600,000 tons from inventories to meet mill demand.  
 In another ICE market, orange juice for September delivery
climbed 0.9 cent, or 0.6 percent, to $1.467 a pound. Earlier,
the price touched $1.477, the highest-price for the most-active
contract since July 6.
