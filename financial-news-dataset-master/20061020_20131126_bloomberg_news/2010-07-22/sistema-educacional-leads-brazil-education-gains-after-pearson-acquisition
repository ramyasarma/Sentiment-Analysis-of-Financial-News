             Sistema Educacional Brasileiro SA 
led gains among Brazilian education stocks after Pearson Plc
agreed to buy a unit of the company, spurring speculation there
may be more mergers and acquisitions in the industry.  
 Pearson Plc  will acquire SEB’s learning-systems division
for 888 million reais ($504.3 million) to tap growth in Brazil,
the U.K.-based education and publishing company said in a
statement today.  
 “Investors are foreseeing more consolidation in the
sector,” said  Kleber Hernandez , an analyst at Spinelli
Corretora brokerage in Sao Paulo. “Drivers were lacking in the
industry.”  
 SEB rose a record 47 percent in Sao Paulo to 29 reais at
3:08 p.m. New York time, with volume more than 30 times the
three-month average. Its rival Kroton Educacional SA jumped 9
percent to 14.49 reais and earlier gained as much as 11 percent,
the most since April 2009. Anhanguera Educacional Participacoes
SA rose 5.1 percent to 28.90 reais, the highest intraday price
since February.  
 The Pearson-Sistema deal follows Abril Educacao’s purchase
last week of Anglo, a Brazilian provider of teaching systems and
educational courses, for an undisclosed amount.  Grupo Multi ,
owner of the Wizard and Skill language schools in Brazil,
acquired  SOS Computadores  in January.  
 “There is a large space for consolidation in this
sector,” said Hernandez. “Many companies will do the same.”
