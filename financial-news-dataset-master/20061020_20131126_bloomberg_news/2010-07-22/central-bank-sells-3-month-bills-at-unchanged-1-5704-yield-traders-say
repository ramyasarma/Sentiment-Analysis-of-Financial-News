             The People’s Bank of China sold
three-month bills at a yield of 1.5704 percent in open-market
operations, unchanged for a fourth straight sale, according to
traders at China Citic Bank Corp. and Bank of Shanghai Co.  
 The monetary authority, which offered 80 billion yuan
($11.8 billion) of the 91-day notes, has let the yield rise at
five previous auctions this year. The rate last climbed four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.5704 percent on
June 10.
