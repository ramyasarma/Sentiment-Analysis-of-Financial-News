             Australia is trailing Pakistan by
108 runs at tea on day two of their second Test in Headingley in
Leeds.  
 Australia, which was all out for 88 in its first innings,
was 62-2 after the opening session of its second innings. Shane
Watson was out for 24 and Simon Katich for 11 as Australia began
chasing a deficit of 170 runs.  
 Australia had won the toss and decided to bat, having taken
the first match in the two-game series by 150 runs.  
 The series is being held in England because of security
concerns over staging games in Pakistan. It counts as a home
series for Pakistan.
