             Citigroup Inc.  cut its outlook for
China’s 2010 economic expansion by a percentage point after the
world’s third-largest economy showed signs of slowing at the
end of the second quarter.  
 China’s  gross domestic product  growth forecast was lowered
to 9.5 percent from 10.5 percent, Citigroup’s biggest one-month
reduction in the country’s outlook since late 2001, the bank
said in a report. It also trimmed its full-year global growth
projections for 2010 and 2011 as well as for the U.S. and
emerging markets, while reducing Japan’s for next year.  
 “We have become somewhat less optimistic on near-term
growth prospects,” Citigroup said in the report led by Chief
Economist  Willem Buiter  yesterday. “We think the more
plausible risk is of an extended period of relatively sluggish
industrial country growth over the next few years.”  
 The Citigroup document came as Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the U.S. economic outlook
remains “unusually uncertain.” Europe’s debt crisis and
China’s steps to curb property prices have fueled concern that
global economic growth will slow.  
 The bank said China will grow at an 8.8 percent rate next
year, 0.5 percentage point lower than previously forecast, and
inflation will reach 3.6 percent in 2011, 1 percentage point
lower than its earlier outlook, according to the monthly report,
which was last published on June 23.  
 ‘Inflation Is Cooling’  
 “ Inflation  is cooling along with the economy,” wrote
Minggao Shen, head of China research at Citigroup, and  Ken Peng ,
a Beijing-based economist. “We downgrade our growth and
inflation forecasts on much weaker momentum.”  
 China expanded 10.3 percent in the second quarter, easing
from the 11.9 percent increase in January-to-March period, the
statistics bureau said on July 15. The inflation rate eased to
2.9 percent in June from 3.1 percent in May. Figures this month
showed property prices in 70 Chinese cities fell 0.1 percent in
June from May, snapping 15 months of gains, according to a
survey by the National Development and Reform Commission.  
 Deutsche Bank AG forecast China’s economy will grow 8.6
percent in 2011 from an expansion of 9.6 percent this year,
according to a report yesterday.  
 U.S. Forecast Cut  
 Citigroup forecast global GDP will rise 3.7 percent this
year and 3.3 percent in 2011, trimming its projections by 0.1
percentage point each. The U.S. 2010 forecast was reduced by
0.4 percentage point to 2.8 percent, and its 2011 outlook was
lowered by 0.2 point to 2.6 percent.  Japan’s GDP  in 2011 will
be 1.9 percent, also 0.2 point slower than previously forecast.  
 The bank cut its forecasts for growth in emerging markets
to 6.6 percent this year and 5.8 percent in 2011.  
 While lowering its outlook for GDP, Citigroup said that a
reversal in the world recovery is unlikely and an increase in
company earnings for 2011 is achievable.  
 “We think that current fears of a global double-dip are
overdone,”  Robert Buckland , an equity strategist at Citigroup
in London, wrote in the document. “The recent setback in
global equities represents a buying opportunity.”  
 The  MSCI World Index  has fallen 7 percent this year,
reducing the price-to-earnings ratio to 15.7 times from about
21.6 times at the start of the year.  
 Securitized products may offer attractive risk-weighted
returns or higher-yielding safe havens from volatility in the
broader market, according to the report.  
 “The short and defensive nature of the market continues
to attract cash investors seeking to pick up a positive spread
to treasuries and agencies while remaining relatively short,”
Citigroup analysts led by  Mary E. Kane  said.  
 Citigroup also forecast that while a correction in the
dollar continues, there are “simply not enough fundamental
differences between G-10 currencies to warrant strong trends.”  
 The lender’s outlook for the next three months is for the
euro to trade at $1.31 from $1.275 yesterday, the pound to be
$1.49 from $1.52 yesterday and the yen to trade at 87,
unchanged from yesterday, the report said.
