             Iron ore production in China, the
world’s largest consumer of the commodity, rose to a daily
record last month, helping steelmakers cut imports, according to
HSBC Holdings Plc.  
 Daily output reached 3.4 million metric tons last month,
HSBC analysts led by  Daniel Kang  said in a report dated July 21.
That’s equivalent to an annualized output of 384 million tons of
concentrate with 63 percent iron content, compared with last
year’s 238 million tons, the report said.  
 China is ramping up domestic production to help cut its
reliance on imports from Vale SA, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio
Tinto Group, which account for three quarters of global trade.
The domestic iron ore industry is profitable if prices exceed
1,000 yuan ($148) a ton, HSBC said.  
 “We expect iron ore imports to slow in coming months,”
the analysts wrote in the report. “We believe that these
pricing levels will continue to encourage domestic miners to
continue production at high levels.”  
 Iron ore prices  at Tangshan, Hebei province, have risen for
seven of the past eight days. Prices are up 13 percent to 1,130
yuan a ton from the 1,000 yuan a ton price reached on July 2, a
four-month low, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. The price is for ore with 66 percent content.  
 China’s Ministry of Land and Resources has set a target of
1,100 million tons of domestic ore production by 2015, up 25
percent from 875 million tons last year, HSBC said.  
 China Vanadium Titano-Magnetite Mining Co. , the second-
largest operator of iron ore mines in Sichuan province, rose
11.2 percent, the biggest gain since its listing last October,
to close at HK$2.77 in Hong Kong trading.
