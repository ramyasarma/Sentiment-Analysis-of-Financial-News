             Carlyle Group is seeking about $1
billion in a sale of skin-care company Philosophy Inc., three
years after acquiring the maker of “Hope in a Jar” moisturizer
for half that amount, said three people with knowledge of the
plan.  
 The Washington-based firm hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  to
explore options and may consider an initial public offering if
no buyer emerges, said two of the people, who declined to be
identified because the sale is private. Carlyle bought
Philosophy in March 2007 in a $475 million deal.  
 Private-equity firms are selling holdings to return profits
to investors and convince them to commit money to new deals.
Carlyle, which is also exploring the sale of defense and
aviation company Arinc Inc. and pipeline company Kinder Morgan
Inc., is the most acquisitive buyout firm this year with about
$7 billion in announced transactions, three of them in the last
two weeks.  
 The sale process for Philosophy is at an early stage, with
calls placed recently to other private-equity firms and
cosmetics rivals, the people said.  
 Christopher Ullman , a spokesman for Carlyle, declined to
comment.  
 Takeovers of cosmetics companies have picked up after last
year’s stock market rebound, with 45 deals worth $3.21 billion
announced this year, up from 33 deals and $1.01 billion a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Bare Escentuals  
 Estee Lauder Cos., the maker of Clinique and Bobbi Brown
cosmetics, in May agreed to buy Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics Inc.
to target women aged 18 to 35. That followed Shiseido Co.’s
acquisition of Bare Escentuals Inc. for about $1.8 billion to
expand outside a shrinking domestic market.  
 U.S. prestige beauty sales, which include makeup, skin care
and fragrance products sold at department stores, dropped 6
percent to $8.19 billion in 2009 according to the NPD Group
Inc., a market research firm based in Port Washington, New York.  
 Shiseido’s offer valued Bare Escentuals at 10.36 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Philosophy had Ebitda
of $60 million last year, meaning it would be worth $622 million
at the same multiple.  
 Philosophy’s adjusted Ebitda, which exclude management fees
and some other costs, was $42 million in 2008. Bare Escentuals’
Ebitda declined 5.5 percent to $176.9 million in the fiscal year
ended Jan. 3, 2010, from the prior period, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Skin Peels  
 Two of the people with knowledge of the sales process said
the company may fetch around $800 million.  
 Philosophy, which makes anti-aging  moisturizers , one-minute
skin peels, perfumes and lipsticks, was founded in 1996 by skin-
care entrepreneur Cristina Carlino. She wanted to bridge the gap
between skin-care products offered in doctor’s offices and
retail stores. Philosophy retail shops, Sephora, J.C. Penney
Co., Nordstrom Inc., Macy’s Inc. and QVC Inc. sell the skin-care
brand.  
 Carlyle used $202.6 million from its fourth U.S. buyout
fund to acquire Philosophy. The firm marked that equity
investment at 1.25 times cost in the first quarter, according to
the investor letter.  
 Carlyle Partners IV, which holds stakes in companies from
Dunkin’ Brands Inc. to The Nielsen Company, has used 97 percent
of its $7.8 billion as of the end of the first quarter,
according to the letter.  
 Kinder Morgan  
 Kinder Morgan, the fund’s biggest investment, is going
ahead with a plan to sell shares in an initial public offering,
people with knowledge of the process said last week. The
Houston-based company, which was taken private in a $22 billion
leveraged buyout three years ago by Goldman and Carlyle, held
interviews with banks seeking to underwrite the share sale, the
people said.  
 Earlier this month, Carlyle sold medical-care provider
Multiplan Inc. to BC Partners Ltd. and Silver Lake Partners, in
a transaction valuing the company at $3.1 billion.  
 Carlyle Partners IV received $50.8 million in dividends
from Philosophy during the first quarter of 2010. The company’s
debt and equity has dropped to $466.1 million from $475 million
at the time of the takeover.
