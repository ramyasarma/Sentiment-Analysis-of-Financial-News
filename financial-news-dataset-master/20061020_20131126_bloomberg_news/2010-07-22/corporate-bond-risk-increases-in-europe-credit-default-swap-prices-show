             The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 4 basis
points to 525, according to Markit Group Ltd. at 7:16 a.m. in
London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals a deterioration in
the perception of credit quality.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1.5 basis points to 116, Markit
prices show.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
