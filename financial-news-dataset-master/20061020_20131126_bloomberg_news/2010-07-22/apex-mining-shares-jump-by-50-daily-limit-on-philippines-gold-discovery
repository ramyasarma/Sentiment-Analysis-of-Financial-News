             Apex Mining Co. , the Philippine gold
producer, rose by the daily 50 percent limit in Manila after
saying it may have found “high-grade” bullion in a mine in the
south.  
 Apex Class A shares , reserved for Filipinos, gained 50
percent to 4.05 pesos at the noon close of trading in Manila.
The stock had the sharpest gain since Dec. 2, 2004. The  Class B
shares , with no ownership restrictions, also jumped 50 percent
to 3.75 pesos, the highest close since Sept. 18.  
 Apex  “intersected high-grade gold” in a previously
untested part of the Maco mine, located on the southern island
of Mindanao, according to a filing to the Philippine Stock
Exchange yesterday. Apex has prospected the area since 1970.  
 “The discovery got some investors excited,” said  James Lago , head of research at Manila-based PCCI Securities Brokers
Corp. “If this find does have a high gold content, the
valuation of the mine site will increase.”  
 Apex’s A and B shares recorded the two biggest percentage
gains in the  Philippine Stock Exchange All Share Index , which
decreased 0.2 percent. The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange
Index, made up of the market’s 30 biggest companies, fell 0.1
percent.  
 ‘Bonanza’  
 Today’s gain wiped out the stock’s losses this year. Apex’s
A shares have risen 42 percent since the end of 2009, while the
B shares have gained 34 percent.  
 “Investors who own  Apex  have hit a bonanza,” said Astro
del Castillo, managing director at Manila-based investment
advisory firm First Grade Holdings Inc. “Until the size of this
discovery is determined, the stock will be the target of
speculation.”  
 The  company  expects to produce 25,000 ounces of gold this
year after output grew 41 percent to 12,142 ounces in the first
half, Chairman  Colin Patterson  said in Apex’s annual
stockholders meeting last week. Apex produced 20,727 ounces of
gold in 2009.  
 “The mineralized zone contains highly anomalous gold
mineralization averaging 209.5 g/t gold over a drilled thickness
of 1.75 meters at an elevation of 470RL,” Apex said yesterday
in the filing.
