             Russian lawmaker  Sergei Pugachyov ’s
United Industrial Corp. wants more than $3 billion for as much
as a 75 percent stake in Russia’s second-largest untapped
deposit of coking coal,  Vedomosti  reported.  
 The company may hire Credit Suisse Group AG in coming days
to manage the sale of the Yenisey Industrial unit, which holds
the license, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the plans. Yenisey Industrial is valued at about
$5 billion, Vedomosti reported.  
 Japan’s Mitsui & Co. may buy as much as 25 percent of the
company and get an option to increase its stake to as much as 49
percent, the newspaper said. Russian steelmakers OAO Severstal,
OAO Novolipetsk Steel,  Evraz Group SA  and OAO Magnitogorsk Iron &
Steel may also seek a stake in the deposit, the newspaper said.  
 Pugachyov’s International Industrial Bank on July 7 became
Russia’s first bank to renege on its foreign debt since 1999
after defaulting on $453 million of bonds.
