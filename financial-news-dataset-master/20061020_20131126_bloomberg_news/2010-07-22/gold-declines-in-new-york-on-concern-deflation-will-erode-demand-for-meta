             Gold futures fell in New York for
the first time in three days on speculation that deflation will
hurt demand for precious metals and other assets as a hedge
against higher costs for consumer goods.  
 Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress
yesterday said that “the economic outlook remains unusually
uncertain.” Before today, gold rallied 8.7 percent this year,
touching a record $1,266.50 an ounce on June 21. The cost of
living in the U.S. fell in June for a third straight month, the
government said on July 16.  
 “Gold does not look good,” said  Leonard Kaplan , the
president of Prospector Asset Management in Evanston, Illinois.
“Deflation is here, and it’s only going to get worse.
Everything goes down in a deflationary scenario. Gold goes down
the least.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery dropped $6.60, or 0.6
percent, to $1,185.20 an ounce at 9:22 a.m. on the Comex in New
York.
