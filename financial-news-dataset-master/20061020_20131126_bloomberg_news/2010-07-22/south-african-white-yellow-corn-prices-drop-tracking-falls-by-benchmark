             Corn in South Africa, the largest
producer of the grain on the continent, fell after prices
dropped in the U.S., which competes for African export markets.  
 December-delivery corn declined 0.7 percent to $3.9075 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 10 a.m. Johannesburg
time.  
 White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, dropped 2 rand, or 0.2
percent, to 1,187 rand ($157) a metric ton today. Meal made from
the grain is the country’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for September delivery fell 8 rand, or 0.7
percent, to 1,175 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly for
animal feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are among
the world’s largest exporters of the grain.  
 Wheat for September delivery rose 12 rand, or 0.5 percent,
to 2,490 rand a ton. Morocco, Egypt and Algeria are Africa’s
largest wheat growers.  
 Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold in tons:
