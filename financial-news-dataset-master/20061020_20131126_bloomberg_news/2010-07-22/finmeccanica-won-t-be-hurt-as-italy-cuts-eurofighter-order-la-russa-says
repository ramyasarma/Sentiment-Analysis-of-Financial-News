             Italy’s decision to reduce its order
for Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH jets to 96 from 119 was made
in agreement with Finmeccanica SpA and won’t hurt the defense
contractor, Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa said today in
Rome.  
 La Russa called the July 20 decision to cut the order
“courageous” because “we recognized that we didn’t need as
many fighters even though we had made a committment to buy
more.” The reduction will save 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion),
which can be used for other defense investments, La Russa said.
