             Damas International Ltd., a Dubai-
based jewelry retailer, signed an extension to a standstill
agreement on debt with most of its bank creditors.   
 The standstill accord has been extended until Sept. 30 to
allow the company to complete its restructuring plan, Damas said
in a statement to Nasdaq Dubai today. “The company has agreed a
term sheet with the steering committee of its bank lenders and
which has now been sent to the entire lender group for
approval,” it said.
