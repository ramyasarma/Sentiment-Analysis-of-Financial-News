             Singapore Airlines Ltd. , the world’s
second-largest airline by market value, will add more flights to
cities including Los Angeles and Moscow in response to a global
rebound in travel.  
 Capacity to Russia and the U.S. will increase, with flights
on the Singapore-Los Angeles and Singapore-Moscow-Houston
sectors operating daily, the airline said in an e-mailed
statement today. The new schedules are for the northern winter
period of Oct. 31 to March 26, the airline said.  
 Global air travel is reviving with premium services rising
by the most in six years in May, the  International Air Transport
Association  said last week.  
 “The adjustments are in response to further growth in
demand for travel,” Singapore Air said in the statement.  
 The carrier will increase capacity to Australia with a
second daily service on the Singapore-Sydney route with the
Airbus SAS A380, the world’s largest commercial jet, Singapore
Air said. It will also add Tokyo airport to its network.  
 The airline  fell 0.3 percent to S$14.7 at the close of
trading in the city-state. The statement was released after the
stock market closed.
