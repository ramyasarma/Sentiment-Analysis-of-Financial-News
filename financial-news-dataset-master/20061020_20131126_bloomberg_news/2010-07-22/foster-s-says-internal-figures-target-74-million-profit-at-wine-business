             Foster’s Group Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest brewer, is targeting A$84 million ($74 million) in
earnings before interest and tax from its domestic and New
Zealand wine business this financial year.  
 The profit is an internal management target for the 12
months ending June 30, 2011, the Melbourne-based company said
in a statement today. Foster’s will release results for the
year ending June 30, 2010, on Aug. 24  
 Foster’s, which is planning to spin off its global wine
assets from the beer division next year, released the
earnings target in response to media reports earlier today.
The company doesn’t normally release data for just the
Australia and New Zealand wine business and didn’t provide
comparative numbers.  
 The company yesterday renamed its global wine business
Treasury Wine Estates ahead of the split, with  labels 
including Penfolds, Lindemans, Beringer and Castello di
Gabbiano.  
 Foster’s  shares  rose 0.9 percent to A$5.89 at the 4:10
p.m. market close in Sydney. The stock has gained 7.1 percent
this year, compared with a 10 percent decline in the S&P/ASX
200 Index.
