             Philip Morris International Inc. ,
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, posted a 28
percent gain in second-quarter profit after raising cigarette
prices in countries such as Australia and Mexico.  
 Net income advanced to $1.98 billion, or $1.07 a share, the
New York-based company said today in a statement. Excluding some
items, earnings were $1, compared with the 97-cent average of
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company also raised its
full-year profit forecast.  
 The price increases have helped Philip Morris, the maker of
Marlboro cigarettes, make up for falling shipments in the
European Union, where struggling economies in Greece and Spain
and higher taxes sapped demand. Revenue rose 14 percent to $17.4
billion, with favorable foreign exchange rates adding $419
million. All Philip Morris’s sales come from outside the U.S.  
 “Higher prices more than offset the negative effect of
volume,”  Thomas Russo , a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner in
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said today by telephone. He  manages 
more than $3 billion, including Philip Morris shares.  
 The company  projected  2010 profit of $3.75 to $3.85 a
share, helped by currency adjustments. That compares with last
month’s forecast of $3.70 to $3.80.  
 Philip Morris rose 95 cents to $50.84 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained
5.5 percent this year, compared with a 1.9 percent drop in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  
 Total Shipments  
 Philip Morris shipments totaled 241 billion cigarettes, an
increase of 0.3 percent excluding acquisitions. Shipments sank
6.2 percent in the European Union while climbing 35 percent in
Asia as distributors in Japan boosted inventories before a
planned October tax increase.  
 “Our broad geographic footprint continues to serve us
well, enabling us to deal with weakness arising in markets where
economic recovery remains subdued,” Chief Executive Officer
 Louis Camilleri  said today in the statement.  
 Pricing added $341 million to Philip Morris’s sales last
quarter. A year earlier,  profit  in the period was $1.55 billion,
or 79 cents a share.  
 Philip Morris has operated an independent publicly traded
company since 2008 following its spinoff by Richmond, Virgina-
based Altria Group Inc.  
 Separately,  Reynolds American Inc. , the second-largest U.S.
tobacco company, also raised its full-year profit forecast.
Excluding some items, earnings will be at least $4.90 a share,
compared with a previous minimum of $4.80, the cigarette maker
said. Reynolds’s brands include Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes,
as well as Grizzly snuff. Analysts on average project $4.94.
