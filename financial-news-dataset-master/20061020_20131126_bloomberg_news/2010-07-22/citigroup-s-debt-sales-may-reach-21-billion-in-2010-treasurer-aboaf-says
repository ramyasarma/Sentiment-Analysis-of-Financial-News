             Citigroup Inc. , the bank 18 percent
owned by the U.S. government, may sell as much as $21 billion of
debt this year, up from an earlier target of $15 billion,
Treasurer  Eric Aboaf  said in an interview.  
 The bank, which sold about $8 billion of debt through June
30, may sell another $10 billion to $13 billion through
December, Aboaf said today. That includes about $2 billion of
retail structured notes each half of the year, he said. The
figures exclude about $3 billion of local bond sales this year
by the bank’s foreign units.  
 The revised target is less than half the $45.5 billion of
Citigroup long-term debt that matures this year, based on a
presentation today on the New York-based company’s  website . The
company is reducing its $413.3 billion of outstanding long-term
debt as of June 30 partly by using proceeds from asset sales to
repay maturing bonds rather than refinancing them.  
 “Without all of those assets, we don’t need as much debt
funding as we once did,” Aboaf said.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  is shrinking the
bank’s $1.94 trillion balance sheet following its federal
bailout in 2008 and has earmarked about 24 percent of the assets
for eventual sale or liquidation. The bank repaid $20 billion of
the $45 billion of bailout money it received, and the Treasury
Department is selling shares it got by converting the remaining
$25 billion into common stock.  
 ‘Modest’ Historically  
 Citigroup sold $85 billion of debt last year, when it was
taking advantage of a government program enacted in the wake of
the credit crisis that allowed banks to sell debt with federal
guarantees. The bank sold $47 billion of long-term debt in 2008.  
 Before the credit-crisis, Citigroup sold about $37 billion
in 2007 and $30 billion in 2006, Aboaf said.  
 “This is pretty modest by historical standards and will
stay modest by historical standards because of all the progress
we’ve made in de-risking and reducing the balance sheet,” he
said.  
 On a conference call today with investors, Aboaf said
Citigroup doesn’t plan to refinance the debt sold under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s  Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
Program , as the bank further reduces its overall debt load.  
 Citigroup has $20.3 billion of TLGP debt maturing in 2011,
out of $45 billion in overall long-term maturities that year. In
2012, it has $38 billion of TLGP maturities, out of $68.2
billion overall.  
 Excluding local country sales, the company will sell about
$20 billion of debt in each of those years, according to the
website presentation.
