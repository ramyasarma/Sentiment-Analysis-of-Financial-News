             OAO Deka , Russia’s second-largest
maker of the traditional soft drink kvas, said it is selling
three times the amount of the beverage in July as the worst heat
wave in almost 40 years spreads across the country.  
 “We are selling triple the amounts of kvas this year
compared with July sales in previous years,” Deka said in an e-
mailed response to questions. Russian kvas sales will rise
between 45 percent and 50 percent this year, compared with a 9
percent increase in 2009, it said.  
 A heat wave in the western part of Russia, the worst since
1972, will last another 10 days, the country’s chief forecaster
said July 20. Temperatures have broken July records in dozens of
cities in the region, including Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and
Samara, while Moscow may break the all-time record of 36.8
degrees centigrade (98.2 degrees) this weekend.  
 Kvas is made from bread or malt and can be flavored with
sugar, birch sap and fruit. It’s naturally bubbly and contains
negligible amounts of alcohol.  
 Prices for rye and barley, used to make kvas, are rising as
the drought curbs supply, Deka said.
