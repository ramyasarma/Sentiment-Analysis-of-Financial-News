             Growth in Germany’s manufacturing
and services industries unexpectedly accelerated in July as
concern over Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis eased.  
 An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
German  services industry  rose to 57.3 this month from 54.8 in
June, London-based Markit Economics said today in an initial
estimate. That’s the highest in almost three years, Markit said.
Economists had projected the index would fall to 54.5 in July,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  
 A gauge of  German manufacturing  rose to 61.2 in July from
58.4 in the prior month, Markit said. Economists had forecast a
decline to 58, the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey showed.  
 The “data point to a stronger-than-anticipated start to
the third quarter, with both manufacturers and service providers
seeing a jump in output growth,” Tim Moore, an economist at
Markit, said in a statement. “However, the manufacturing sector
posted the weakest rise in new exports for six months as demand
remained fragile across the euro area.”
