             U.K. stocks  were little changed,
with the benchmark FTSE 100 Index posting a third straight
weekly advance, as analyst downgrades of Standard Chartered Plc
and Kingfisher Plc were offset by gains at mining companies.  
 Standard Chartered, the lender that generates the majority
of its earnings in Asia, declined 1 percent after UBS AG cut its
recommendation on the shares. Kingfisher lost 2.3 percent as
Societe Generale SA and Liberum Capital downgraded the stock.
Anglo American Plc rose 1.2 percent as copper climbed. ARM
Holdings Plc led rising shares on the FTSE 100 after the U.K.
designer of semiconductors used in Apple Inc.’s iPhone signed a
licensing agreement with Microsoft Corp.  
 The  FTSE 100  slipped 1.19, or less than 0.1 percent, to
5,312.62 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, paring this week’s
increase to 3 percent. The  FTSE All-Share Index  advanced 0.1
percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  slipped 0.7 percent.  
 The FTSE 100 has fallen 8.8 percent from this year’s high
on April 15 amid concern that growth in the U.S. and China is
slowing and that austerity measures from European governments
will hurt the recovery in the region. The measure clawed back
some of the retreat this week as more than 85 percent of
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies that reported results
since July 12 topped estimates.  
 “Governments have not helped financial markets stabilize
as they did during the financial crisis of 2008-9,” said  Lothar Mentel , chief investment officer for Octopus Investments Ltd. in
London. “This has led to confusion and negative sentiment,
resulting in market falls that are at odds with positive company
fundamentals and underlying steady economic progress.”  
 U.K. Economy  
 A report today showed the U.K. economy grew almost twice as
much as economists forecast in the second quarter in the fastest
expansion for four years as rebounding services, manufacturing
and construction ignited the recovery.  
 Standard Chartered  was cut to “hold” from “buy” at UBS.
The stock lost 1 percent to 1,824 pence.  
 Kingfisher lost 2.3 percent to 220.2 pence. Societe
Generale cut its recommendation on the shares to “hold” from
“buy” and Liberum lowered its rating to “neutral” from
“buy.”  
 Close Brothers Group Plc lost 3.3 percent to 687 pence,
leading falling shares on the FTSE 250 Index, after saying its
loan book was 2.9 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) as of June 30
and funds under management were unchanged at 7.3 billion pounds.  
 ‘Negative to Neutral’  
 “The only good news in today’s statement is the loan book
growth,” analysts at Execution Noble wrote in a report today.
“Other than that it has been negative to neutral news on all
fronts.”  
 Britvic Plc, the maker of Tango soda and Robinson’s fruit
drinks, lost 2.5 percent to 505 pence after saying it remained
“cautious about consumer sentiment.”  
 Anglo American advanced 1.8 percent to 2,522.5 pence as
copper rose for a fifth day in London. Kazakhmys Plc gained 1.9
percent to 1,185 pence.  
 ARM surged 12 percent to 353.3 pence after it signed a
licensing agreement with Microsoft. ARM will let Microsoft
access designs to build products including the Windows Phone,
the Cambridge, England-based company said today in a statement.
The companies didn’t disclose the terms of the agreement.  
 Dana Petroleum Plc jumped 14 percent to 1,706 pence after
Korea National Oil Corp. raised its offer for the U.K. oil and
gas explorer to 1.7 billion pounds.  
 Vodafone Group Plc  rose 1 percent to 150.55 pence after the
world’s largest mobile phone company unexpectedly returned to
service revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter, riding
demand for Apple Inc.’s iPhone in the U.K. and other markets.
