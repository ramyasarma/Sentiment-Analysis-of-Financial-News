             International banks reaffirmed
support for their units in Romania during a meeting yesterday in
Brussels, the International Monetary Fund and European
Commission said in a joint statement.  
 “To support the sustained efforts of the national
authorities and ensure the economy’s return to a sustainable
growth path, parent banks reaffirmed their long-term commitment
to the country,” the IMF and EC said in the statement released
late yesterday from Washington.  
 The parent banks of the nine largest lenders in Romania
attended the meeting. Those lenders are: Erste Group Bank AG,
Raiffeisen Group, Eurobank EFG, National Bank of Greece SA,
UniCredit SpA, Societe Generale SA, Alpha Bank SA, Volksbank
International and Piraeus Bank SA.  
 Several banks said they intend to increase their business
in Romania over the coming months as the economy begins to
recover, according to the statement.
