             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts fell the most in two months after policy
makers unexpectedly slowed the pace of interest rate increases
and said inflation was less of a threat amid slowing global
growth.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage
point, to 10.86 percent at 8:25 a.m. New York time. The yield
fell as much 12 basis points earlier today, the biggest intraday
slide since May 6.  
 The central bank’s board, led by  Henrique Meirelles ,
increased the benchmark interest rate half a point to 10.75
percent yesterday. The move, which was anticipated by traders in
the interest-rate futures market, surprised 48 out of 51
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. They had predicted another 0.75
percentage point increase, the same as at the bank’s two
previous meetings.  
 “Investors are now re-calibrating their forecast for the
Selic rate for the remainder of the year, and this decline
reflects that,” said  Nick Chamie , global head of emerging
markets research at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. “Up until
recently most people had been expecting a 75 point rate hike,
but beginning in July perceptions started to change as data
started to come in softer than expected.”  
 The real strengthened 0.6 percent to 1.7698 per dollar
today from 1.7808 yesterday.
