             Soybean exports from Brazil, the
world’s second-biggest producer after the U.S., may rise to a
record 30 million metric tons this year as China-led demand
increases, an industry group said.  
 Exports of the oilseed will rise 5 percent from the 28.5
million tons shipped last year, said  Sergio Mendes , a director
at the Brazilian Association of Grain Exporters, which
represents trading companies including Cargill Inc. and  Archer
Daniels Midland Co .  
 “The Chinese appetite is increasing and Brazil is ready to
supply what is needed,” Mendes said in a telephone interview
from Sao Paulo yesterday.  
 China, the world’s biggest consumer of soybeans, will
import a record 48 million tons of the oilseed in the year
ending Sept. 30 and 50 million in the following 12 months,
according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report this month.  
 Brazil has shipped 19.3 million tons of soybeans this year
as of June 30, Mendes said. China buys about 57 percent of the
South American country’s soybean exports, he said.  
 Soybean output in Brazil will rise to a record 68.7 million
tons this year from 57.2 million tons last year, the Agriculture
Ministry said on July 8. Brazil will export 28.8 million tons of
soybeans this year, up from 28.6 million in 2009, the ministry
said.
