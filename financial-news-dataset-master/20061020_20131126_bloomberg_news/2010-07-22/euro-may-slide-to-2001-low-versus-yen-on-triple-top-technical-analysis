             The euro may decline to an eight-
year low against the yen as charts show it has formed a so-
called triple top, according to Tokai Tokyo Securities Co.,
citing trading patterns.  
 The 16-nation euro, which has slumped 16 percent against
Japan’s currency this year, has started to rally three times
since June with each advance capping out between 133 yen and 114
yen. The euro is now poised to resume its decline and may drop
beneath this year’s low of 107.32 yen, said  Yoh Nihei , a trading
group manager at the securities company.  
 “The euro’s advance has been capped consistently,” Tokyo-
based Nihei said in an interview with Bloomberg. “It’s in a
gradual downtrend.”  
 The euro traded at 112.54 yen as of 8:54 a.m. in Tokyo from
112.10 yen in New York yesterday. The last time it traded weaker
than 107.32 yen was in November 2001.  
 The 16-nation currency yesterday briefly fell below the
baseline of a so-called ichimoku chart around 110.37 yen, Nihei
said. Should it clearly break below that level, it may then fall
to this year’s low reached on June 29, he said.  
 A triple top occurs when a currency makes three consecutive
peaks around the same height and suggests it is going to weaken.
Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
through analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows.
The baseline is the sum of the highest high and lowest low over
the past 26 days.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
