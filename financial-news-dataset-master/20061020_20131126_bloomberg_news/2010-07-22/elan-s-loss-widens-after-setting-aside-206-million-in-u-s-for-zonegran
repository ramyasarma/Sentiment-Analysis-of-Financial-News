             Elan Corp . reported a wider second-
quarter loss after it set aside $206.3 million to settle U.S.
government charges linked to the sale and marketing of the
Zonegran epilepsy treatment.  
 The company, Ireland’s largest drugmaker, had a loss of
$213.1 million in the three months ended June 30, compared with
a loss of $68.2 million a year earlier, it said in a Business
Wire statement today. Revenue fell to $264.5 million as falling
demand for older drugs wasn’t enough to offset a surge in sales
of the multiple sclerosis medicine Tysabri.  
 Separately, Ib Sonderby, who wrote to the company’s board
yesterday complaining of “ineptitude and mismanagement” at the
helm of the company, is “seriously misinformed,” Elan
spokeswoman Gemma Gilligan said in an interview.  
 The Wall Street Journal reported today that Sonderby
accused the board of failing to “monitor” Chief Executive
Officer  Kelly Martin , who Sonderby alleges “publicly mislead
investors, destroyed collaborations with Elan’s corporate
partners” and “extracted millions of dollars in compensation.”  
 “Over the last several years, Elan’s Board, including the
independent directors, have met with investors frequently and
taken significant steps to address concerns,” Elan’s Gilligan
said. “Many of the matters Mr. Sonderby raises in the letter
have been addressed previously.”
