             India’s benchmark 10-year  bonds  rose
for the first time in three days after the highest yield in more
than a month attracted investors to the securities.  
 The yield slid after Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said the U.S. economic outlook is “unusually
uncertain.” Bleak global economic conditions may restrain the
 Reserve Bank of India  from raising policy rates by more than a
quarter of a percentage point at its July 27 meeting, said
 Srinivasa Raghavan , head of fixed-income at IDBI Gilts.  
 “There is probably some buying because yields had risen
sharply,” Mumbai-based Raghavan said. “Bonds at this level
have more or less factored in a 25 basis point increase.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.68 percent as of the
5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The price rose 0.07, or 7 paise per 100 rupee
face amount, to 100.82.  
 All 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the
 reverse-repurchase rate  to be raised next week by a quarter of a
percentage point to 4.25 percent to curb inflation. All except
one predict a similar rise in the repurchase  rate  to 5.75
percent.  
 Wholesale prices  rose 10.6 percent from a year earlier in
June, following a 10.2 percent gain in May, official figures
show. April’s 11.2 percent increase was the biggest since
September 2008.  
 An index measuring  wholesale prices  of agriculture products
including lentils, rice and vegetables compiled by the commerce
ministry rose 12.47 percent in the week ended July 10 from a
year earlier, according to a statement released today. It gained
12.81 percent the previous week.  
 One-year interest-rate swaps in India, derivative contracts
used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs, increased.
The fixed payment made to receive a floating rate fell one basis
point to 5.92 percent.
