             Investors should prepare to sell the
Canadian dollar against the yen as the pair approaches the
completion of a price pattern called a “bearish Gartley” within
the next few days, according to FX360, an online currency
research firm.  
 The pattern will be realized if the Canadian currency rises
to 85.34 yen, the point at which investors should sell,  Roger Stojsic , a Chicago-based technical analyst at the firm, wrote in
a research note yesterday. Investors should target a subsequent
decline by Canada’s dollar to 83.54 yen, he wrote.  
 The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, rose 1 percent
yesterday to 83.83 yen. It touched 86.46 yen, the highest this
month, on July 14, and weakened to 81.72 yen on July 16.  
 Investors should set a stop for the trade at 86.52 yen,
just above the double-top formation comprising the highs on July
12 and July 14.  
 Prices must stay above 82.29 yen per loonie for the trade
to remain valid, Stojsic wrote.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
