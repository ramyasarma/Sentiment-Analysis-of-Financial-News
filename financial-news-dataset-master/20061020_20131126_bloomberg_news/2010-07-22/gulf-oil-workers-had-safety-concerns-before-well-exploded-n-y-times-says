             Workers on  Transocean Ltd .’s
Deepwater Horizon oil rig that caught fire and sank in the Gulf
of Mexico said conditions were unsafe on the platform, the New
York Times reported.  
 In one of two surveys carried out before the April 20
accident that killed 11 and started the worst oil spill in U.S.
history, Transocean employees said that they often “saw unsafe
behaviors” and were concerned about reprisals if they reported
problems,  the newspaper  said.  
 BP Plc , the majority owner of the well that the rig was
drilling, has taken most of the blame for the accident so far
and is responsible for the cleanup.  Partners Anadarko Petroleum
Corp.  and Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. are withholding payments of
their share of the costs.  
 Lloyds Register, which conducted the surveys on behalf of
Transocean, said the reports were confidential and declined to
make the documents available, according to spokesman Mark
Stokes. Lloyds will cooperate fully with any official
investigation, he said.  
 Reliability  
 The rig suffered from poor equipment reliability because
drilling took priority over maintenance, the New York Times
cited the survey as saying. A second report found the blowout
preventer hadn’t been fully inspected since 2000 and that 26
components and systems on the rig were in “bad” or “poor”
condition, the paper reported.  
 Transocean spokesman  Guy Cantwell  wasn’t immediately
available for comment. The Times reported that a Transocean
spokesman, who confirmed the existence of the reports, said most
of the components in “poor” condition were minor and the
blowout preventer had been inspected in the timeframe required
by the manufacturers.  
 Transocean employees onboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling
rig when it exploded in the Gulf of Mexico have become the focus
of a U.S. government probe into the cause of the fatal disaster,
the Coast Guard reported this week. No one from BP, which leased
the rig to drill the Macondo well, or from other companies
involved in the work, has been named a party of interest,
according to the website of the investigative panel.
