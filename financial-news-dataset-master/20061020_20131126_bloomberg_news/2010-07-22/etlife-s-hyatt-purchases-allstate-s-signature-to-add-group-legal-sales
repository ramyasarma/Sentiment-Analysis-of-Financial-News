             MetLife Inc. , the largest U.S. life
insurer, has  purchased  a business providing group legal-services
coverage from  Allstate Corp. , adding to its Hyatt Legal Plans
business.  
 The Signature LegalCare unit will be part of Hyatt Legal,
the New York-based insurer said today in a Business Wire
statement. It didn’t disclose terms of the deal.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Robert Henrikson  is seeking to
expand MetLife’s coverage of companies and groups. The firm
acquired Odonto A Saúde Empresarial in 2008 to add dental
insurance in Brazil. Hyatt Legal, which MetLife bought in 1997,
 provides  members with services such as preparation of wills and
basic consultations.  
 “We pick up some market share and get rid of a
competitor,” Bill Brooks, CEO of Hyatt Legal Plans, said of the
Allstate deal in an interview. The MetLife subsidiary gets most
of its business from plans in which employees pay for benefits,
a market which is “growing rapidly,” Brooks said.  
 MetLife rose  $2.40, or 6.5 percent, to $39.29 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange trading. Northbrook, Illinois-based
Allstate rose 63 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $28.06.  
 Hyatt Legal has more than 1,300 group clients, serving more
than 6 million people, Brooks said. The Cleveland-based unit
employs about 100 people, and won’t take on any of the about 13
workers at the Allstate unit, Brooks said. MetLife is simply
buying the Allstate book of business, Brooks said.  
 Allstate acquired Signature LegalCare as part of its 2008
purchase of Partnership Marketing Group, said  Maryellen Thielen ,
a spokeswoman for the insurer.  
 “As a small provider of group legal plans, Signature
LegalCare does not fit into Allstate’s core business strategy,”
Thielen said in an e-mailed statement.
