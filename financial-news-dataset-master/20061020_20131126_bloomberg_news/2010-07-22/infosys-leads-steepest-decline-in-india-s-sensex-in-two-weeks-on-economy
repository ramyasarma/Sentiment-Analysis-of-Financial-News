             India’s benchmark stock index rose
to a 2 1/2 year high, led by steelmakers after  JSW Steel Ltd. 
said it will consider raising funds, including selling shares to
a strategic investor.  
 Tata Steel Ltd., the nation’s biggest producer of the metal,
climbed 1.9 percent, and Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. gained 1.1
percent.  JSW Steel Ltd. , the third-largest producer, increased
2.7 percent, advancing for a sixth day.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
increased 135.92, or 0.8 percent, to 18,113.15, its highest
close since February 2008. The gauge reversed an earlier decline
after reports showed unexpected growth in Europe’s manufacturing
and U.K. retail sales.  
 The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
climbed 0.8 percent to 5,441.95. The  BSE 200 Index  rose 0.7
percent to 2,306.24.  
 “Indian investors are looking at Europe and it’s doing
very well at present,” said  Vaibhav Sanghavi , a fund manager at
Ambit Capital Ltd. in Mumbai. “It’s really about sentiment more
than anything else.”  
 Tata Steel, the owner of Corus in the U.K., climbed 1.9
percent to 540.85 rupees. Jindal Steel rose 1.6 percent to
646.95 rupees. JSW Steel advanced 2.1 percent to 1,200.55 rupees.
The company’s board will decide on its fund-raising plan at a
meeting on July 27, the company said today in a statement to the
Bombay Stock Exchange.  
 More Than Forecast  
 A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both industries increased to 56.7 from 56 in June,
London-based Markit Economics said today. Economists had
projected a drop to 55.5, the median of 18 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey showed. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  
 In the U.K., retail sales rose more than economists’
forecast in June as the World Cup soccer tournament stoked
purchases at electrical goods shops and department stores. The
Sensex, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, and Standard & Poor’s 500
Index reversed losses after the reports.  
 Dr. Reddy’s  slid 1.7 percent to 1,380.7 rupees after its
stock rating was cut by Morgan Stanley analysts  Sameer Baisiwala 
and Saniel Chandrawat, who cited its outperformance, “full”
valuations and a moderation in earnings drivers. Separately,
India’s second-biggest drugmaker posted a 14 percent drop in
first-quarter profit on weaker sales from North America and
Europe, which last year accounted for more than half of its
sales.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net 3.72 billion rupees ($79.1
million) of Indian equities on July 21, raising total
investments in the stocks this year to 407 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 ACC Ltd.  (ACC IN), India’s biggest cement maker, fell 1.1
percent to 816.15 rupees after second-quarter profit slid 26
percent to 3.59 billion rupees.  
 Bajaj Auto Ltd.  (BJAUT IN), India’s second-largest
motorcycle maker, advanced 3.2 percent to 2,490.5 rupees after
saying it plans to give one free share for each one investors
hold. Bajaj Auto also reported first-quarter profit doubled.  
 Coromandel International Ltd.  (CRIN IN), a fertilizer
producer, surged 3.4 percent to 508.9 rupees, the highest since
at least 1991. The company’s first-quarter profit more than
doubled from a year ago.  
 Mastek Ltd.  (MAST IN), a software developer, sank 7.8
percent to 271.1 rupees, the most in three months, after saying
fourth-quarter profit tumbled more than 90 percent from a year
earlier.  
 Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd.  (PWGR IN) rose 1.6 percent
to 101.45 rupees, its steepest daily gain in a month, after
India’s cabinet approved the sale of a stake in the state-run
company.  
 United Breweries Ltd.  (UBBL IN), owner of India’s biggest
beer brand, surged 20 percent to 281.6 rupees. The stock posted
its steepest advance in more than a year after first-quarter net
income more than doubled.
