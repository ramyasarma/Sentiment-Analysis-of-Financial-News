             U.S. Trade Representative  Ron Kirk 
says it’s too early to gauge the impact of the Canada-Colombia
trade agreement on U.S. producers.  
 Kirk, who met Canadian Trade Minister  Peter Van Loan  today
in Ottawa, told reporters he “values” the partnership with
Colombia.  
 He also said that World Trade Organization negotiations on
a new trade accord, which have been dogged by clashes between
rich and poor economies since they began in Doha, Qatar in 2001,
will progress when advanced emerging countries are ready to make
concessions.  
 Countries like Brazil, China, Russia and India have already
benefited “extraordinarily” from the access they have to
markets in the U.S., Canada and the European Union and must now
prepare to make some of the “very difficult decisions”
required to conclude the Doha round, Kirk said.  
 “The surest way to bring the Doha round of development
talks to a conclusion is to begin with a dose of reality,” Kirk
said. “Let’s look at the world as it is today and not as it was
15 years ago.”  
 The Group of 20 industrialized and emerging nations want to
reach an accord this year.
