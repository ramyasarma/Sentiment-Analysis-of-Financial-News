             Money managers tout their investing
strategy in books, at seminars and on blogs. Some call it a
science, others an art form. And then, of course, there is luck.
In that spirit, here is one more stock-picking technique to add
to the list: Take a look at who is lunching at the White House.  
 Since becoming president,  Barack Obama  has held seven
lunches with small groups of chairmen and chief executive
officers, including  Jeff Bezos  of  Amazon.com Inc. ,  Ken Chenault 
of  American Express Co. ,  Ursula Burns  of  Xerox Corp.  and  Howard Schultz  of  Starbucks Corp. , Bloomberg Businessweek reports in
its July 26 issue.  
 In four of the lunches, the guests’ companies, as a group,
outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index 30 trading
days after the repast. In two cases, the groups’ shares
underperformed the S&P 500 a month after lunch with the
president. Altogether, the six lunch groups outdid the S&P by
more than 2 percentage points. Thirty days haven’t elapsed since
a seventh lunch held on July 1.  
 Just a coincidence? Only partly, says  Barry Ritholtz , CEO
of equity research firm  Fusion IQ . Losers don’t get asked to
hang out with the president, he says. The White House likely is
putting together invitation lists so that the president is
dining with executives at the top of their games and not
associating with companies in decline or under investigation.  
 “If the captain of your team gets a phone call from the
White House, it probably means your team is about to win the
World Series or already has won,” Ritholtz says.  
 Ties to Winners  
 Adds CEO  Andrew Rudd  of  Advisor Software : “Obama is trying
to associate himself with winners and it’s sort of potentially
reinforcing.”  
 Not every one of the 33 publicly traded companies’ share
prices rose.  Eastman Kodak Co.  fell 8.4 percent in the 30
trading days after Chief Executive  Antonio Perez  dined with
Obama on Oct. 8, 2009. The company reported its fourth straight
quarterly loss later that month.  
 On the plus side, Amazon rose 40 percent after Bezos
attended the Oct. 8 lunch.  
 Rudd, whose Lafayette, California, company provides
analytical tools to wealth managers, cautions against building
an investment strategy around the president’s guest lists. The
sample size is too small, Rudd says, and the shares’ performance
is probably a statistical anomaly.  
 Still, he says: “I’m sure people will bet on this, just as
certain people pick companies with stock prices at 9.99 or the
same names as their aunts.”  
 The president’s stock-picking magic is still working. On
July 1 he had lunch on a patio outside the Oval Office with the
heads of  Walt Disney Co. ,  Ford Motor Co. ,  Comcast Corp.  and
 Archer Daniels Midland Co.  Thirteen trading days later, as of
July 20, their companies’ shares had risen an average of
9.3 percent vs. 4.8 percent for the S&P.
