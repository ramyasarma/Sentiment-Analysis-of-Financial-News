             Trading of bullish American Eagle
Outfitters Inc.  options  jumped to triple the four-week average
as investors boosted bets that the teen retailer will rally 20
percent in seven months.  
 Almost 12,900 calls to buy the shares changed hands as of
4:30 p.m. in New York, 47 times the number of puts to sell, as
the stock rose 4.1 percent to $12.53. The  most-active contracts 
were February $15 calls, which rose 27 percent to 70 cents. They
changed hands 8,397 times, compared with a previous open
interest of 522, which indicates that buyers of new contracts
initiated most of today’s transactions.  
 “The stock is coming off a 15-month low so investors
probably think it’s time for it to start rising,” said  Patrick Mortimer , director of options trading at Pipeline Trading
Systems LLC in New Hope, Pennsylvania. “Also it will soon be
back-to-school season.”  
 The trading indicates investors expect the retailer, which
targets 15- to 25-year-olds and has more than 1,000 stores in
North America, to recover  its loss  since May 26, when it plunged
the most in more than two years after its second-quarter profit
forecast fell short of analysts’ estimates. The shares haven’t
closed above $15 since.  
 Trailing Estimates  
 American Eagle, which competes with teen retailers such as
Aeropostale Inc. and  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , said that
excluding some costs, profit for the quarter ending August 1
won’t exceed 16 cents a share. That trailed the 21-cent average
of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The  forecast  reflects
“weaker business trends early in the quarter,” the Pittsburgh-
based retailer said. Analysts are now expecting quarterly
earnings of 12 cents a share, Bloomberg data show.  
 The retailer, which will report second-quarter earnings
next month, said it is cutting inventory levels in the second
half, after increasing stock by 15 percent in the first quarter.
The stock has risen 8 percent since June 29, when it fell to its
lowest price since March 2009.
