             3M Co. , the maker of stethoscopes
and sandpaper, raised its full-year forecast and posted second-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as sales climbed at
all divisions for the third straight quarter.  
 Profit excluding Medicare-related charges will be as much
as $5.80 a share this year, up from a maximum of $5.60 forecast
in April, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts had predicted $5.64, the average of 16
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Chief Executive Officer  George Buckley  has boosted sales by
expanding into emerging markets, where revenue increased 38
percent in the second quarter. 3M, an economic bellwether
because of its product range spanning the automotive, consumer
and health-care markets, has introduced new products in the past
12 months for 3-D technology and solar mirror panels.  
 “It was not an intergalactic blow-away, but it was really
solid,”  Nick Heymann , a New York-based analyst with Sterne Agee
& Leach Inc., said today in an interview. “Their strategy of
taking share in emerging markets is definitely working.”  
 Operating Margins  
 3M rose $1.60 to $83.90 at 9:11 a.m. in pre-market trading.
The shares  increased  11 cents to $82.30 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading and had fallen less than 1
percent this year before today.  
 Second-quarter net income increased 43 percent to $1.12
billion, or $1.54 a share, from $783 million, or $1.12, a year
earlier. Analysts, on average,  projected  profit of $1.47 a
share. Sales climbed 18 percent to $6.73 billion.  
 Sales at the electro and communications division climbed 32
percent to $726 million, the biggest increase of any unit.
Revenue at the display and graphics division rose 30 percent to
$1.05 billion, driven by sales of films used on LED back-lit
televisions.  
 The company boosted its forecast for sales volumes from
existing businesses to grow as much as 15 percent from as much
as 12 percent.  
 All six of 3M’s units posted operating margins of 22
percent or higher. 3M said its full-year operating income
margins will exceed 22 percent.
