             Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ,
the world’s second-largest copper producer, said it may expand
processing capacity at its El Abra mine in northern Chile.  
 Freeport may build a copper mill in partnership with
Codelco, Chile’s state-owned copper company, Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Adkerson  said yesterday on an earnings
conference call, according to transcripts. Codelco, the world’s
largest copper miner, holds 49 percent of the project and
Freeport owns the rest.  
 “That’s a very significant opportunity for us,” he said.  
 Adkerson is increasing Freeport output at operations where
the company slowed output in the past two years as the global
economic slowdown cut demand. The company is evaluating projects
in South America, North America, Africa and Asia to boost copper
production.  
 Separately, Freeport plans to spend $725 million through
2015 at El Abra to extend the life of the mine by a decade,
Adkerson said.  
 Freeport based in Phoenix said yesterday that second-
quarter profit topped analysts’ estimates because of higher-
than-forecast sales of the metal.  
 Futures for September delivery gained 5.85 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $3.1515 a pound at 9:04 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The most-active contract erased a drop and climbed as high
as $3.16, the highest price since June 1.
