             Sandringham Private Value, a closely
held investment firm, filed a defamation suit in Tokyo against
 Fujitsu Ltd. , claiming Japan’s biggest computer-services company
damaged the fund’s reputation by implying it had links to
organized crime.  
 The Japanese unit of U.K.-based Sandringham Capital
Partners Ltd., which in April sued three Fujitsu executives for
defamation, is seeking 330 million yen ($3.8 million) in
compensation as well as a public apology from the company,
according to an e-mailed statement today by the plaintiff’s
lawyer,  Tsugio Yada .  
 The lawsuit filed yesterday in the Tokyo District Court
stems from a dispute between Fujitsu and its former President
 Kuniaki Nozoe  whom the company forced out in September amid
accusations he was connected to a fund with an “unfavorable
reputation. Sandringham is suing Fujitsu because of statements
made at the company’s annual shareholder meeting and in
interviews with executives given after the initial suit was
filed, according to the statement.  
 ‘We assumed that we would be sued as a company because we
supported,” the executives named in the earlier suit, said
Fujitsu spokesman  Etsuro Yamada . “We’ll make our argument in
court.”
