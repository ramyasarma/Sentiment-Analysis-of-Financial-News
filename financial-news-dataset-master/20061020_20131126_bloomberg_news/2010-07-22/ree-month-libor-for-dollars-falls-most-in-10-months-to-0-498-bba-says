             The rate that banks say they charge
each other for three-month loans in dollars between banks in
London fell the most in 10 months, according to the British
Bankers’ Association.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
fell to 0.498 percent today, from 0.506 percent yesterday, the
BBA said. That’s the biggest decline since Sept. 4, 2009, and
the lowest level since May 21 this year.  
 Libor for three-month loans in euros rose for a sixth-
straight day, to 0.816 percent from 0.814 percent. That’s the
most since August 2009.
