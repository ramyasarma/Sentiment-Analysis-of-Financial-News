             Angola’s central bank left its
rediscount rate, the interest that it charges banks to borrow
money, at 30 percent today.  
 Banco Nacional de Angola has left the rate unchanged since
October 2009, the Luanda-based bank said on its website today.
It was 19.57 percent in 2008 and rose to 30 percent during 2009.  
 Angola’s inflation has remained between 13.5 percent and 14
percent for at least the past year, even after the kwanza was
devalued in October of 2009. The local currency is trading at
about 92.57 to the dollar today, compared with 77.8 before the
devaluation.  
 Angola secured a $1.3 billion loan from the International
Monetary Fund last November in exchange for improving financial
management and transparency. An IMF team is due in Angola this
month to assess progress before approving the next installment
of the loan, worth $342 million. The IMF program has lent Angola
$515 million since November.  
 Oil accounts for about 95 percent of Angola’s exports and
about 60 percent of its gross domestic product, according to the
Economist Intelligence Unit.
