             Australia’s proposed tax on iron ore
and coal mine profits favors Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton Ltd.
and Xstrata Plc over smaller producers, according to Andrew
Forrest, the chief executive officer of Fortescue Metals Group
Ltd. Fortescue said the tax should be changed to exclude
magnetite iron ore projects. Fortescue would be prepared to
support an advertising campaign against the tax should the
Association of Mining and Exploration Companies decide to put in
one in place, Forrest told reporters in Perth. The association
may decide to resume the campaign as soon as this weekend,
Forrest said.
