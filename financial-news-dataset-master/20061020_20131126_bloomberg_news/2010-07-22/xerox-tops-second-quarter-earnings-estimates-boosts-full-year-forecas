             Xerox Corp.,  the largest maker of
high-speed color printers, jumped the most since April in New
York trading after posting second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates and boosting its full-year forecast.  
 Per-share profit, excluding some costs, was 24 cents a
share, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts  estimated  21 cents on average, according to
a Bloomberg survey. The company said full-year earnings,
excluding costs, would be between 88 cents and 92 cents per
share, compared with the previous forecast of at most 85 cents.  
 Xerox increased revenue 2 percent to $5.5 billion as
customers resumed spending after curbing costs amid the
recession. The company also got a sales boost from its $6
billion purchase of  Affiliated Computer Services Inc.,  its bid
to expand into services.  
 “Demand is coming back,” said  Shannon Cross , an analyst
at Cross Research in Livingston, New Jersey, who rates the
shares “buy.” “It shows the synergies with ACS are working --
that’s important to investors.”  
 Xerox added 62 cents, or 7.4 percent, to $9.03 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest jump
since April 23. The shares have advanced 6.7 percent this year.  
 Equipment sales, an indicator of future sales for products
such as ink and paper, jumped 12 percent to $930 million.  
 ACS Acquisition  
 Buying ACS, which handles payroll and other administrative
work, helped Chief Executive Officer  Ursula Burns  triple revenue
from services last quarter. In May, ACS signed a $1.6 billion
contract to manage California’s Medicaid information system for
10 years.  
 The company has signed 10 deals by selling ACS services to
Xerox customers and vice versa since the acquisition closed in
February, Burns said on a conference call today.  
 “These are signs of modest, yet steady economic
improvement,” Burns said on the call. “Demand continues to
improve.”  
 Expense reductions alone make the ACS deal attractive,
before any potential impact on revenue, Deutsche Bank analyst
 Chris Whitmore  wrote in a note July 14. The company is on track
to save more than $100 million this year as a result of the ACS
takeover, it said in May. The number may top $375 million in
three years.  
 The full-year profit forecast topped the average analyst
estimate of 87 cents a share. The company said it expects per-
share earnings this quarter of 19 cents to 21 cents, in line
with estimates.  
 Net income for the second quarter rose to $227 million, or
16 cents a share, from $140 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier
before the ACS acquisition.  
 Cutting Costs  
 Xerox is using services from ACS to automate its own
administrative tasks, trimming costs. It has also cut 2,500 jobs
this year and will take a $280 million restructuring charge this
year, which should lead to an additional $140 million in
savings.  
 The company will lower debt to $8.7 billion by the end of
the year, from $9.6 billion now, the company said. It will be $8
billion by September 2011.  
 Xerox is on track to reach $1 billion in cash by the second
half of next year, when it will consider resuming share
repurchases, Chief Financial Officer  Larry Zimmerman  said in an
interview.
