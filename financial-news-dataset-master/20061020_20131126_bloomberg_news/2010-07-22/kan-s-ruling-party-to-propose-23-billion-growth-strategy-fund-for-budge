             The ruling Democratic Party of Japan
will ask the government to devote 2 trillion yen ($23 billion)
of next year’s budget to growth strategy initiatives, a party
official said.  
 The party won’t ask the government to require each ministry
to slash their budget requests by a specific amount, Koriki
Jojima, acting head of the DPJ’s policy research council, told
reporters in Tokyo today. Ministries and agencies typically
submit budget requests to the government in August.  
 The government released a strategy last month to achieve
faster economic growth over the next decade. It also unveiled a
plan to cap spending and bond sales over the next three years to
contain the world’s largest public debt burden.
