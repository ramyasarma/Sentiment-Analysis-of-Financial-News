             Brown Publishing Co., the bankrupt
owner of Dan’s Papers in New York’s Hamptons, said it received
two qualifying bids, including one from company insiders, that
together would account for all its assets.  
 Brown Media Corp., controlled by the debtor’s top three
executives, offered $22.4 million in cash plus the assumption of
liabilities for most of the assets, including Dan’s, according
to documents filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Central
Islip, New York.  
 The Delphos Herald , which owns publications in Ohio, agreed
to buy newspapers and websites in that state for $3.59 million
plus the assumption of liabilities, the filing said.  
 Brown, based in Cincinnati, filed for Chapter 11 creditor
protection in April after a “significant decrease” in
advertising sales.  
 A sale hearing is scheduled for today in Central Islip. The
auction of the assets took place July 19 and 20 at the offices
of K&L Gates LLP in New York.  
 The case is In re Brown Publishing Co., 10-73295, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District New York (Central Islip).
