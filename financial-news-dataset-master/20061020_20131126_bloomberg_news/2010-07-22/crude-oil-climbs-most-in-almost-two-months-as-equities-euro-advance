             Crude oil surged to the highest
close in 11 weeks as stocks rallied after EBay Inc. and
Caterpillar Inc. earnings beat estimates and growth accelerated
in European manufacturing and services.  
 Oil climbed 3.6 percent after the European industries
unexpectedly grew at a greater rate last month, signaling fuel
demand in the region will gain. Prices also gained as the dollar
dropped against the euro, bolstering the appeal of commodities.  
 “Everyone is focused on the same things, and that is
changes in the economic growth outlook,” said  David Greely ,
head of energy research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York.  
 Crude oil for September delivery rose $2.74 to $79.30 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since May 5. It was the biggest increase since May
27. Futures are up 21 percent from a year ago.  
 “We expect to see a breakout above $80 in the next couple
of months,” Greely said. “Oil will probably trade in the $85-
to-$95 range during the second half of the year.”  
 A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers increased to 56.7 from 56 in June, London-based Markit
Economics said today. Economists had projected a drop to 55.5,
the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Members of the European Union accounted for 17 percent of
global oil demand in 2009, according to BP Plc, which publishes
its BP Statistical Review of World Energy each June.  
 Brent crude oil for September settlement rose $2.45, or 3.3
percent, to end the session at $77.82 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest close
since June 25.  
 Topping Estimates  
 EBay, Caterpillar and AT&T Inc. joined the 85 percent of
S&P 500 companies that have topped analysts’ earnings estimates
in the second-quarter reporting season, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 2.5 percent to
1,095.93, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2 percent
to 10,344.93. The  Europe Stoxx 600 Index  rose for a third day.  
 “Equities have been driving the boat lately,” said  Bill O’Grady , chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in St. Louis.  
 The dollar tumbled as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said unemployment is “the most important” problem
facing the U.S. and the Fed has “pushed monetary stimulation to
the highest point in American history.” Bernanke was speaking
to the House Financial Services Committee in the second day of
semiannual congressional testimony on monetary policy.  
 The U.S. currency declined to $1.2895 per euro, down 1.1
percent from $1.2754 yesterday.  
 ‘Bullish for Commodities’  
 “We’ve finally got some good news from Europe,” said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester, Massachusetts. “It’s clear from Bernanke’s
comments that the Fed will keep interest rates low, which is
going to hurt the dollar and be bullish for commodities.”  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities increased
2 percent to 266.86, the highest level since May 5.  
 In the last 10 minutes of trading, oil broke out of a range
it had held since June 8, from $71.09 to $79.38 a barrel. The
market’s range for 2010 is $64.24 to $87.15.  
 “The market has been range-bound for a number of weeks,”
said  Jason Schenker , president of Prestige Economics LLC, an
Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. “Traders are desperate
for fundamental cues that point to what direction this market
should take.”  
 U.S. Supplies  
 Crude oil declined 1.1 percent yesterday after the U.S.
Energy Department said crude  stockpiles  grew by 360,000 barrels
to 353.5 million last week. Gasoline inventories climbed 1.12
million barrels to 222.2 million barrels last week, the highest
level since April, the report showed.  
 Gasoline for August delivery climbed 7.88 cents, or 3.8
percent, to $2.1466 a gallon in New York, the highest settlement
since June 25. It was the biggest one-day increase since Feb. 2.  
 “We’ll trade in a range through the summer,” said  Sarah Emerson , managing director of Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Wakefield, Massachusetts. “Once summer is over, prices should
drop without the support of gasoline.”  
 U.S. gasoline consumption peaks during the summer, when
Americans take vacations. The so-called driving season lasts
from the Memorial Day weekend in late May to the Labor Day
holiday in early September. Refiners often shut units for
maintenance in September and October as fuel demand falls.  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 513,620 contracts as of 3:08
p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 576,372 contracts yesterday, 20
percent below the average of the past three months. Open
interest was 1.23 million contracts.
