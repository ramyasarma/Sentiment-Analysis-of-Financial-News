             Exxon Mobil Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell
Plc and two other oil companies will spend $1 billion to
research and build a containment system to handle deep-water oil
spills in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Exxon, Shell,  Chevron Corp.  and  ConocoPhilips  will each
give $250 million to establish a non-profit organization, the
Marine Well Containment Co., to produce and manage the
equipment. The system will be designed and built over the next
12 to 18 months to handle spills of 100,000 barrels a day in
waters as deep as 10,000 feet (3,048 meters), the companies said
in a statement yesterday.  
 The oil industry has been criticized by lawmakers in the
U.S. for being unprepared to deal with deep-water accidents,
following the explosion of BP Plc’s Macondo well in the Gulf of
Mexico on April 20. The blast killed 11 people, caused the worst
oil spill in U.S. history and resulted in a six-month ban on
deepwater drilling in the Gulf.  
 “For an incident in deeper waters with higher production
levels, the response capability of containment and spill
response is proven by this incident to be inadequate,”  Jim Mulva , chief executive officer of Houston-based ConocoPhillips,
said in an interview yesterday. The companies have been working
with the government for six weeks on the project, Mulva said.  
 The plan may also aim to blunt punitive new government
regulations on drilling, ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a
Washington-based policy analysis firm, wrote in a note to
clients.  
 Drilling Moratorium  
 A six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling was issued in
May after the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig, which BP
leased from Transocean Ltd. A federal judge in New Orleans
rejected the ban as too broad, and Interior Secretary  Kenneth Salazar  responded July 12 with new drilling suspension rules
that have kept deep-water rigs idle.  
 Salazar said the six-month drilling moratorium was put in
place while the government reviews drilling safety and
industry’s ability to contain a well blowout and respond to
another oil spill. The containment system proposal is “a
beginning point with the conversation relative to how we address
those three fundamental issues,” Salazar said at a hearing of
the House Oversight and Government Reform committee today.  
 “The proposal announced yesterday is an interesting one,”
 Michael Bromwich , director of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement, said at the same
hearing. “We’re going to want to review and study it carefully.
We’ll ask for more elaboration on it from the companies.”  
 Standard Equipment  
 The new container system may become standard equipment for
offshore drillers in the U.S. and probably would be adopted in
other places around the world, wrote ClearView analysts  Kevin Book , F. Chase Hutto and Amanda Fessenden.  
 The equipment would add costs for the industry, while also
providing potential new business for oil-service companies, the
analysts wrote.  
 “Exxon Mobil is taking the lead on the engineering-
construction phase,” said  Alan Jeffers , a spokesman for the
Irving, Texas-based company. “We’re going to ask others to join
and those who choose not to join can have access to the
equipment via commercial arrangement.”  
 BP, based in London, isn’t participating in the containment
project.  
 “They’ve certainly been informed of what the four
companies have been doing,” said Mulva. “When the Macondo
incident is ultimately resolved and the well is killed, we
expect in due time that BP will join the effort.”  
 BP’s Focus  
 BP summoned offshore experts in April, including some from
the four companies, to help devise ways to halt the leak after a
failed attempt to contain the gusher. The company has spent
$3.95 billion on the response as of July 19.  
 “Our focus right now is the response to the current
situation,”  Scott Dean , a BP spokesman, said yesterday. “We’ve
said from early on that there will be lessons learned from this
incident and we’re sure that changes will be made in the
industry.”  
 Early designs are for a containment system with a tight
seal that will fit over a well near the seabed and channel oil
and gas through pipes leading to vessels at the surface that
will collect and store the fuel, according to a fact sheet
distributed by the new group. The system will be able to
mobilize in 24 hours.  
 “If we all do our jobs properly, this system will never be
used,”  Rex Tillerson , CEO of Exxon Mobil, said in the
statement. “The extensive experience of industry shows that
when the focus remains on safe operations and risk management,
tragic incidents like the one we are witnessing in the Gulf of
Mexico today should not occur.”
