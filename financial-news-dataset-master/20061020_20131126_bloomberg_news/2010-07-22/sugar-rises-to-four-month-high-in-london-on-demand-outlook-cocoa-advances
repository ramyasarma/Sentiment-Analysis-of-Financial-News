             Sugar jumped to the highest prices
in four months as congestion in Brazil’s ports limit supplies
while demand rises in Asia.  
 The Philippines plans to auction rights as early as July 27
to import 150,000 metric tons of sugar without duty, researcher
F.O. Licht said today in a report. As of July 20, the backlog at
the six main sugar ports in Brazil, the world’s largest
producer, rose to a record 111 vessels from 103 a week earlier.  
 “The physical market is tight,” said  Ricardo Scaff , a
trader at Rabobank International in New York. “Asia is looking
for increasing imports. Overall stocks are very low. The whole
delay of delivery is supporting nearby contracts.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery surged 83 cents, or 4.8
percent, to 18.3 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price reached 18.38 cents, the highest level for a
most-active contract since March 22.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, refined sugar for October
delivery leaped $17.50, or 3.2 percent, to $559.70 a ton, after
touching $562.60, the highest level since March 9.  
 “There is big demand for refined sugar,”  Leonardo Bichara Rocha , an economist with the International Sugar Organization,
said in a telephone interview. Raw sugar “will stay supported”
at about 17 cents in the fourth quarter, he said.  
 Indian Monsoon Wanes  
 Milling of locally produced sugar cane in the Philippines
may be delayed by a month to October after crop growth was
stunted by a drought, Licht said. The country already has
auctioned rights to import 150,000 tons, according to the
report.  
 India’s monsoon, the main source of irrigation for the
nation’s sugar-cane growers, was 17 percent below the 50-year
average in the week ended July 21, the weather office said.
India is the second-biggest producer and the top consumer.  
 “Mid-July is too early in the growing cycle for dryness to
set in,”  Michael Ferrari , a vice president at the Weather
Trends International Inc. in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, said today
in a report. Output in the year starting Oct. 1 may trail
forecasts, he said.  
 The Indian Sugar Mills Association has forecast a crop of
25 million metric tons, up 33 percent from the current year.  
 Sugar prices will remain above 18 cents, Ferrari said.
