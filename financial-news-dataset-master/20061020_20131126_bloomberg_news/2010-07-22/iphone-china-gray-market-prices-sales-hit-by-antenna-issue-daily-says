             Chinese prices of iPhone 4
smartphones smuggled from the U.S. and resold have dropped by
about 70 percent to about 6,000 yuan from 20,000 yuan over the
last month because of media reports about the device’s antenna
reception problem, according to one Beijing vendor, the China
Daily reported.  
 Gray sales of the phone have dropped “dramatically” since
the vendor’s first sale on June 25, Liu Hailing, an Apple
reseller in the Zhongguancun section of Beijing, was cited by
the paper as saying.
