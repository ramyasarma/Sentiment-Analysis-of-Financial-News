             Lonmin Plc , the world’s third-
largest platinum producer, said third-quarter output of the
metal tumbled 47 percent because of a leak at its main furnace.  
 Costs may be $17.5 million more than planned as Lonmin pays
rivals to take over some smelting and help it meet a sales goal,
the London-based company said today in a statement. Lonmin aims
to sell 700,000 ounces of refined platinum in the financial year
through September.  
 The company plans a third reconstruction of its No. 1
furnace in as many years in November and December to try to halt
leaks. The latest incident occurred on March 30 and took more
than two months to repair. Lonmin crushes mined rock before
converting it into a liquid that’s smelted in the furnace to
produce matte, which is then refined into metal.  
 “The furnace has been performing steadily for over one
month now,”  Lonmin  said today. The company said in May it also
planned to build a smaller smelter at a cost of $40 million to
provide backup and expand capacity by 30 percent by late 2012.  
 While smelter problems “must get sorted out,” they
“obscure a strong turnaround” at the company, RBC Capital
Markets analyst  Leon Esterhuizen  wrote in a note. Third-quarter
platinum concentrate output rose 11 percent to 170,000 ounces.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Ian Farmer  was appointed in 2008 to
fix a series of problems at Lonmin ranging from safety stoppages
to labor strikes. Farmer took over in September as platinum
tumbled from a record at the end of a six-year commodities boom,
prompting him to idle operations and cut jobs by about a fifth.  
 Return to Health  
 An increase in Marikana mine’s underground output shows
“progress in returning Lonmin to operational health,” JP
Morgan Cazenove analyst  Steve Shepherd  wrote in a note.  
 Lonmin rose 56 pence, or 3.9 percent, to 1,495 pence by the
close of London trading, giving it a market value of 3 billion
pounds ($4.6 billion). The stock has slid 24 percent this year,
the second-biggest drop on the 17-company  FTSE 350 Mining Index .  
 Refined platinum production fell to 91,952 ounces in the
three months through June from a year earlier, the company said
today. Output in the nine months to that date slid 22 percent
from a year earlier to 383,873 ounces.  
 Costs will probably increase by less than South Africa’s
rate of inflation this year, Lonmin said in November. Consumer-
price inflation in May was 4.6 percent.
