             ATC Technology Corp. , a maker of
automotive drive-train products including transmissions, was
sued by a shareholder who contends the company is worth more
than a $512.6 million offer from Genco Distribution System Inc.  
 Investor Ronald Demarines is asking a judge to halt the
planned buyout at its current price and to award damages and
legal fees, according to a lawsuit filed today in the Chancery
Division of Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.  
 “Shareholders will be permanently and incurably harmed if
the proposed transaction is allowed to be consummated,”
Demarines said in his complaint.  
 ATC, formerly known as Aftermarket Technology Corp.,
announced on July 19 that it had agreed to be bought by Genco
for $25 per share in cash, according to court papers.  
 “At least one analyst on Yahoo! Finance set a target price
for ATC of $30 per share,” Demarines said in the complaint.  
 Mary Ryan , an ATC spokeswoman, said the company had no
comment on the lawsuit.  
 Shares of Downers Grove, Illinois-based ATC rose 17 cents
to $24.25 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading at 5:20 p.m. in New
York.  
 The case is Demarines v. ATC Technology, 10CH31420, Circuit
Court of Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division (Chicago).
