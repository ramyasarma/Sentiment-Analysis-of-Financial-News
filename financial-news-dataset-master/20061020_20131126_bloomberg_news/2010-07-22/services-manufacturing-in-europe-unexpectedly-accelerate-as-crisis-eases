             Growth in Europe’s services and
manufacturing industries unexpectedly accelerated in July as
concern over the European sovereign-debt crisis eased.  
 A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both industries increased to 56.7 from 56 in June,
London-based Markit Economics said today. Economists had
projected a drop to 55.5, the median of 18 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey showed.
