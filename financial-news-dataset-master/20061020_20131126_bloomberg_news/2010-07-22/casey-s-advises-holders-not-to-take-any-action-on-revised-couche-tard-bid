             Casey’s General Stores Inc. today
told shareholders to take no action on a higher takeover offer
by Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.  
 The Canadian retailer today raised its unsolicited offer
for Casey’s to $36.75 in cash. Casey’s board had rejected the
company’s initial $36-a-share offer.
