             Copper rose for a fourth day in
London on a slumping dollar and an increase to a 13-month high
in bookings to remove metal from stockpiles.  
 The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, fell as much as 0.8 percent. That made
commodities priced in the currency cheaper in terms of other
monies. Canceled warrants, as the bookings are known, gained the
most in five weeks.  
 Copper for delivery in three months rose $92, or 1.3
percent, to $6,952 a metric ton at 10:37 a.m. on the LME. The
contract erased a drop of as much as 1.6 percent. Futures for
September delivery gained 1.8 percent to $3.1475 a pound on the
Comex in New York.  
 Copper  inventories  tracked by the LME shrank for a 25th day
today, the lengthiest run since a 40-session streak that ended
on July 2, 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Stockpiles
fell to 416,525 tons, the lowest level since Nov. 18. They’re
down 17 percent this year and headed for the first annual drop
since 2004.  
 Bookings  to remove copper from LME warehouses rose for a
third day. They gained 15 percent, the most since June 14, to
38,550 tons, the highest level since June 2, 2009.  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery on the LME rose 1.3
percent to $2,034 a ton, lead advanced 2.2 percent to $1,907.50
a ton and nickel climbed 2.1 percent to $19,900 a ton. Zinc
added 0.9 percent to $1,935 a ton and tin gained 0.2 percent to
$18,400 a ton.
