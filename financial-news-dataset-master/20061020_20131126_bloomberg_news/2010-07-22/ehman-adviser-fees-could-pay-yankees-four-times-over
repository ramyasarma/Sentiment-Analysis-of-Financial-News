             Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , the
investment bank in bankruptcy since September 2008, paid its
lawyers and managers $873.1 million for 21 1/2 months of work,
or almost $1.4 million a day.  
 By comparison, the five highest paid Major League Baseball
teams’ combined opening day player payrolls this year were about
$792 million, according to USA Today.  
 The restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal LLC, which provided
Lehman with its current chief executive officer,  Bryan Marsal ,
led the payments with $311.6 million in fees for “interim
management” through June, according to today’s  filing  with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York Yankees’
payroll, highest in baseball, is about $206 million this year.  
 “This is going to be the most expensive Chapter 11 case
ever,” said  Stephen Lubben , a bankruptcy law professor at Seton
Hall University School of Law in Newark, New Jersey. “Unless
the unsecured creditors get a decent recovery, there will be
some pressure for the professionals to share the pain.”  
 Lehman, once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank,
has said it may spend five more years selling assets to pay
unsecured creditors as little as 14.7 cents on the dollar. Its
payments to advisers haven’t faced major challenges such as
those in the bankruptcy of automaker Chrysler LLC, which used
U.S. Treasury loans to wind down.  
 Pretty Efficient  
 “There were $1 trillion in claims filed,” Marsal said in
an e-mail. “By and large this case has been without significant
controversy and disputed creditor issues have been at a
minimum. It has been pretty efficiently managed.”  
 Marsal, whose company has more than 100 employees working
on the Lehman account, bills the defunct investment bank by the
hour. Lehman’s total fees to all advisers and managers since it
went bankrupt work out to about $56,250 an hour, assuming a 24-
hour workday and 30 days in a month.  
 Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP  of New York collected $200.6
million for acting as Lehman’s lead bankruptcy law firm.  Milbank
Tweed Hadley & McCloy LLP  got $56.5 million for advising
Lehman’s creditors’ committee.  
 Energy trader Enron Corp.’s three years of bankruptcy cost
$757 million, including $149.4 million paid to Weil Gotshal,
according to the database of  Lynn LoPucki , who teaches
bankruptcy law at the University of California, Los Angeles.  
 June payments to advisers were almost $42.7 million. Lehman
and its affiliates had cash holdings of $18.9 billion on June
30, up from $18.4 billion on May 31.  
 Lehman filed the biggest U.S. bankruptcy in September 2008
with assets of $639 billion. Creditors include Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.,  UBS AG , the New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority as well as individuals who hold Lehman bonds.  
 The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).
