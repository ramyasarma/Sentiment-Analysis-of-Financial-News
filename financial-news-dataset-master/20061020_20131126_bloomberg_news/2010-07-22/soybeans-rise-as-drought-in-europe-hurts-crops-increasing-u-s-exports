             Soybeans rose for the third straight
day after a drought in Europe cut production of canola and
sunflowers, increasing global demand for U.S. oilseeds.  
 U.S. exporters sold 1.115 million metric tons of soybeans
in the week that ended July 15, nearly twice the tonnage the
week earlier, the  Department of Agriculture  said today. China,
the biggest global consumer, took 31 percent. Drought will cut
Germany’s canola crop 11 percent this year, a producer
organization said July 14.  
 “U.S. sales are not slowing” even after Brazil and
Argentina harvested 38 percent more soybeans this year than in
2009, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis. “Export demand is
rising because of the reduced canola crop in Europe.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 2.5 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $9.81 a bushel at 10:48 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after dropping as much as 0.6 percent. Before
today, the most-active futures rose 8.4 this month on
speculation that too much rain in June will reduce the U.S.
harvest.  
 U.S. inventories totaled 571 million bushels as of June 1,
down 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the government said on
June 30. That marked the lowest level since 2004. By Aug. 31,
reserves will total 175 million bushels, 5.4 percent less than
June’s forecast, the USDA said on July 9.  
 The soybean crop in the U.S., the world’s largest grower,
was valued at $31.8 billion last year, second only to corn at
$48.6 billion, government figures show.
