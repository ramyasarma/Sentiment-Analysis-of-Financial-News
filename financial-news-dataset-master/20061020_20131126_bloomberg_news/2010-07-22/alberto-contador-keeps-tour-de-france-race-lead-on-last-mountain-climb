             Alberto Contador kept the lead in
the Tour de France after the last mountain ascent today.  
 He and his closest rival Andy Schleck finished together
after the 11.6-mile climb to the Col du Tourmalet at the end of
stage 17. Schleck finished just ahead of Contador to win the
stage but was unable to eat into the 8-second race lead held by
the Spaniard.  
 There are two more flat stages and a time trial before the
July 25 finish in Paris.  
 Defending champion Contador is a time-trial specialist who
beat Luxembourg’s Schleck by 1 minute, 45 seconds in the
discipline over 25 miles at the 2009 race.  
 Last year’s runner-up, Schleck is seeking to become the
first Luxembourg winner of cycling’s premier race since Charly
Gaul in 1958.
