             Wheat, corn and soybeans fell as
crude oil declined and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke 
said the economic outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”  
 Wheat for September delivery lost as much as 0.8 percent to
$5.8375 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $5.865
at 3:34 p.m. Singapore time. December-delivery corn fell 0.7
percent to $3.9075 a bushel, while soybeans for November-
delivery declined 0.3 percent to $9.76 a bushel.  
 Crude oil declined 0.3 percent to $76.30 a barrel after
losing 1.3 percent yesterday as a U.S. Energy Department report
showed inventories climbed instead of falling as forecast.
Bernanke said the Fed is prepared “to take further policy
actions as needed” to lift growth in the U.S.  
 Grains and oilseeds in Chicago “are simply following the
crude oil market,”  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at
Astmax Co., said by phone from Tokyo. Yesterday’s testimony by
Bernanke also prompted investors to sell commodities and other
riskier assets, he said.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 1.3 percent yesterday
to 1,069.59 at the 4 p.m. close of trading in New York. The two-
year Treasury yielded 0.5519 percent at 11:24 a.m. in Tokyo, the
lowest level on record, while the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index 
declined 0.3 percent.  
 China Boost  
 China, the world’s largest wheat consumer, boosted
purchases of the grain from Australia to “slightly” more than
700,000 metric tons since the start of November, as the Asian
nation replenishes inventories, said Matthew Rutter, head of
trading at CBH Grain, part of the CBH Group and Australia’s
largest grain exporter.  
 China was estimated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
to import 1.3 million tons in the year ended June 30, exceeding
exports estimated at 850,000 tons.  
 China will sell 5 million tons of wheat from stockpiles in
auctions to be held in Zhengzhou and Anhui tomorrow to meet
demand from flour millers, the China National Grain and Oils
Information Center said today in an e-mailed report.  
 Anhui, which was among the provinces affected by tropical
storm Conson, saw torrential rainfall yesterday brought by
tropical storm Chanthu. The central part of China’s Jilin
province received heavy rain, flooding crops, China National
Radio reported yesterday. Jilin is the biggest corn grower in
the country, the world’s second-largest consumer of the grain.
