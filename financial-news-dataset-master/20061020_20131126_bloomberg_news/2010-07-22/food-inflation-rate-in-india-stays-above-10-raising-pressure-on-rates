             India’s food inflation rate stayed
above 10 percent for a 14th straight month, increasing pressure
on the central bank to raise interest rates next week.  
 An  index  measuring wholesale prices of agriculture products
including lentils, rice and vegetables compiled by the commerce
ministry rose 12.47 percent in the week ended July 10 from a
year earlier, according to a statement released in New Delhi
today. It gained 12.81 percent the previous week.  
 Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government is concerned
persistently high food prices will lead to more wage demands,
adding to inflationary pressures. Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said July 20 sufficient rains this year will help
boost agriculture production and cool prices.  
 “Inflationary pressures have not been subdued as yet,”
N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the New Delhi-based National
Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said before the release.
He expects the central bank to raise rates by a quarter-point in
the monetary policy announcement on July 27.  
 The  Reserve Bank of India  has increased its benchmark rates
three times since mid-March by a quarter-point each.  
 The weather office forecasts the June-September monsoon
rains, the main source of irrigation in the country, to be
adequate for farming this year. Last year’s rains were the least
since 1972.
