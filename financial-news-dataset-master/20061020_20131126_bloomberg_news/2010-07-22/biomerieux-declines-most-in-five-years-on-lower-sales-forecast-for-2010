             BioMerieux SA , a maker of tests for
HIV and hepatitis, fell the most Paris trading since the
company’s 2004 initial public offering after lowering its full-
year revenue forecast.  
 BioMerieux  sank  8.46 euros, or 9.4 percent, to 81.28 euros
at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading. BioMerieux, based in Marcy
l’Etoile, France, today cut its 2010 sales growth target,
excluding purchases, to 6 percent from a previous forecast of
around 7 percent. By that measure, revenue increased 5.8 percent
to 344 million euros in the second quarter.  
 “Organic sales growth in the quarter was below
expectations and the forecast cut was a disappointment,”
 Guillaume Cuvillier , an analyst at Gilbert Dupont in Paris who
has an “add”  recommendation  on BioMerieux shares, said in a
telephone interview today. “This said, the market reaction
today is a bit excessive.” BioMerieux stock had gained 14
percent during the two months ended yesterday.  
 A drop in demand for swine flu tests, which had propelled
sales last year, and lower government spending on health care
hurt BioMerieux during the first six months of the year, Chief
Executive Officer  Stephane Bancel  said in a statement today.  
 “The end of the H1N1 pandemic, the low incidence of
seasonal flu and health-care budget cuts in many western
European countries” led BioMerieux to lower its revenue
forecast, Bancel said in the statement.  
 Excluding acquisitions, second-quarter sales jumped 14
percent in the Asia-Pacific region and 9.9 percent in North
America, BioMerieux said. By that measure, revenue in Europe
grew 2.8 percent. Sales were strong in Turkey, Russia, the
Middle East and Africa during the first six months of the year,
it said.  
 Including acquisitions, BioMerieux sales were up 13 percent
in the quarter.
