             Boris Berezovsky , the billionaire
Russian businessman granted asylum in the U.K., had the first
stage of his divorce approved by a London judge.  
 In a hearing that lasted about five minutes at the Family
Court in London, a judge approved a “Decree Nisi” requested by
Berezovsky’s wife of 18 years, Galina Besharova. Parties in a
divorce can apply for a Decree Nisi to be converted to  a full
divorce  after six weeks, according to the court  service website .  
 Today’s decree didn’t decide any financial aspects of the
divorce. The pair are separating because of Berezovsky’s
“unreasonable behavior,” according to court papers. Berezovsky
doesn’t intend to defend the divorce, and has agreed to pay all
the costs of the proceedings, according to the documents.  
 Berezovsky’s spokesman Tim Bell and Penny Jones,
spokeswoman for  Mishcon de Reya , the law firm representing
Berezovsky’s wife, both declined to comment.
