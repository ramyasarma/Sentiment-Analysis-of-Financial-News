             The yen headed for a weekly loss
against the dollar and the euro on speculation Japanese policy
makers will seek to weaken the currency to support the economy.  
 The yen fell versus 14 of its 16 major counterparts today
as earnings optimism triggered a surge in shares and on
prospects the government will add pressure on the Bank of Japan
to take more steps to spur growth. The euro trimmed a weekly
decline versus the dollar as concerns eased that results of
European banks’ stress tests released today will signal the
regional crisis is far from over.  
 “Verbal intervention by policy makers should make an
impact at first” on the yen, said  Marito Ueda , senior marketing
director at FX Prime Corp., a foreign-exchange margin company in
Tokyo. “Amid political instability, the stronger currency
weighs on stocks and exporters, so investors, including
individual traders, will be cautious about the yen’s level.”  
 The yen traded at 86.98 per dollar as of 10:39 a.m. in
Tokyo from 86.95 in New York yesterday, heading for a 0.5
percent decline this week. Japan’s currency was at 112.21 per
euro from 112.10, set for a 0.3 percent drop since July 16. The
euro was at $1.2902 from $1.2893.
