             Imperial Tobacco Group Plc said
cigarette volumes in the nine months to June fell 4.3 percent,
hurt by market declines in Spain, the U.S., Russia and Ukraine.
The company’s performance in the financial year that ends in
September is in line with expectations, the company said in a
statement today.
