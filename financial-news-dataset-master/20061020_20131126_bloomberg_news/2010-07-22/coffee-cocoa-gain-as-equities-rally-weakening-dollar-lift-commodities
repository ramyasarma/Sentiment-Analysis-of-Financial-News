             Coffee futures in New York jumped
the most in two weeks as a rally in equity markets and a weaker
dollar boosted demand for commodities. Cocoa also rose.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index jumped as much as 1.7
percent while the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  climbed 1.3 percent.
The  Dollar Index  dropped 1 percent, falling for the first day in
four.  
 “Strong equity markets and a weaker dollar are helping
most commodities, including coffee,” said  Marcio Bernardo , an
analyst at Newedge USA LLC in New York. “There is also some
fund buying.”  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery gained 2.2 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $1.595 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 10:08 a.m.
in New York. A close at this price would be the biggest advance
since July 7. Before today, the commodity was up 16 percent this
year.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, by 7 percent
in the week ended July 13 from a week earlier, government data
show.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery rose $21, or 0.7
percent, to $2,956 a metric ton in New York. The chocolate
ingredient has fallen 11 percent this year through yesterday.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, cocoa futures for September
delivery lost 2 pounds, or 0.1 percent, to 2,284 pounds ($3,491)
a ton. Robusta-coffee futures for September delivery gained $19,
or 1.1 percent, to $1,691 a ton. A close at that price would be
the biggest gain since July 15.
