             Tenaris SA (TEN) , the world's largest
maker of oil and natural-gas pipes, agreed to buy Hydril Co., a
Texas manufacturer of valves and meters for deepwater drilling,
for about $2.2 billion.  
 Tenaris, based in Luxembourg, will pay $97 a share in cash
for the ordinary and B-class stock of Houston-based Hydril, 17
percent more than the closing price on Feb. 9, according to a
statement released today.  
 Record oil and gas prices have pushed companies to seek
reserves in more challenging areas. At the same time,
infrastructure failures such as the leak at BP Plc's Prudhoe Bay
oil field in  Alaska  have underscored the need for increased
safety in drilling and production. Hydril specializes in
products such as pipe sealants, corrosion barriers and pressure-control valves.  
 ``Over the next three years, it's a positive investment,''
said Niccolo Pini, who helps oversee investments totaling the
equivalent of about $900 million at Banca Ifigest SpA in
Florence,  Italy . ``Hydril represents a good chance for growth
with a good strategic position on the market.''  
 Tenaris's American depositary receipts fell 67 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $46.26 today New York. The stock has gained 55
percent in the past year, giving the company a market value of
$27.3 billion. Hydril rose $12.20, or 15 percent, to $95.24 in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Before today, they had risen 11
percent in the past year.  
 Rocca Family  
 Tenaris is based in Luxembourg and is 60 percent-owned by
Italy's Rocca family, which created a global company after
taking control of Italian steel-tube maker Dalmine in the 1930s.
The Rocca family is now based in Argentina. The company's shares
trade in New York, Milan, Mexico City and Buenos Aires.  
 Tenaris expanded in the U.S. last year through the $2.8
billion acquisition of Chesterfield, Missouri-based Maverick
Tube Corp. The Rocca family also controls Ternium SA, a
Luxembourg-based steelmaker with steel mills in Mexico,
Venezuela and Argentina.  
 Meeting global demand for oil and gas will require an
investment of $6 trillion by 2030, according to the Paris-based
International Energy Agency. This will include repairs as well
as replacement of pipes, valves and refineries.  
 The market for pipes for oil and gas exploration is set to
expand by ``close to 15 percent'' this year and next, Rocca said
in a Sept. 14 interview.  
 Pressure Controls  
 ``It's important for Tenaris to have a company that's a
leader in pressure-control products,'' said Alessandro Frigerio,
who helps manage the equivalent of $64 million at RMJ Sgr in
Milan. ``From an industrial point of view, we don't think this
is a mistake.''  
 Shares of Tenaris have been buoyed by speculation that it
may be a takeover target. The company was the fourth-best
performer on Milan's S&P/MIB Index last year.  
 Tenaris said on Jan. 10 that ``no extraordinary operations
are under way,'' after the  shares  jumped 7.7 percent. On Dec.
13, Russia's OAO Gazprom, the world's biggest producer of
natural gas, denied a Reuters report that it was considering
buying a stake in the company.  
 An unidentified person who answered the telephone at
Tenaris's Paris office today referred questions to U.S.-based
spokesman Nigel Worsnop. Stefania Argento, a Milan-based
spokeswoman for Tenaris, said the company won't comment before a
conference call scheduled at 1 p.m. New York time today.  
 Undeterred  
 The purchase probably wouldn't discourage Gazprom from
making an offer for Tenaris, said Luca Sega, who helps manage
the equivalent of $378 million at Aperta Sgr in Milan.  
 ``Paying a couple of billion euros more wouldn't make any
difference for Gazprom,'' he said.  
 Buying Hydril will add a company that had a 2006  profit  of
$91.3 million on sales of $503 million, Tenaris said.  
 ``This is another major step for Tenaris,'' Chief Executive
Officer Paolo Rocca said in today's statement. ``Hydril is a
company with an extraordinary track record and an outstanding
know-how built over more than 70 years of serving the oil and
gas industry.''  
 Tenaris said it will finance the acquisition with cash on
hand and debt, for which it has already secured bank
commitments.  
 The company is being advised by Citigroup Global Markets
Inc. Credit Suisse Group and USBX Advisory Services LLC are
acting for Hydril, Tenaris said.  
 Hydril is run by Chairman Richard Seaver, President and
Chief Executive Officer Christopher Seaver and Vice Chairman
Patrick Seaver. Members of the Seaver family agreed to vote
shares representing 22 percent of the combined voting rights in
Hydril in favor of the deal, according to the statement.
