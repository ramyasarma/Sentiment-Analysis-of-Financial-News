             Philippine metal production may surge
in the next two years as overseas companies, including Sumitomo
Metal Mining Co., Japan's largest nickel producer, expand or
start operations, Natural Resources Secretary  Angelo Reyes  said.  
 Philippine copper output may increase 68 percent to 32,725
metric tons next year from a forecast of 19,481 tons this year,
and will jump to 348,954 tons in 2009, according to a government
estimate obtained by Bloomberg News today. Gold output may rise
16 percent to 1.35 million ounces from an estimated 1.16 million
ounces this year, and may expand to 2.27 million tons in 2009.  
 The Southeast Asian nation aims to attract $6.7 billion in
investment in 24 priority mines by 2010 and boost output to
benefit from rising metals prices. Miners are developing projects
to access copper, nickel and gold to feed rising global demand.  
 ``Our projection on mining investments is no longer just a
projection,'' Reyes said in a phone interview from Perth,
Australia. ``It's already happening on the ground. Big companies
are already in the Philippines.''  
 ``When we said we anticipate a mining boom in the
Philippines, this is backed up not only by companies investing in
the country, but also the companies' forecast of mineral
production,'' Reyes said.  
 New mines are expected to produce 15,000 tons of copper next
year, helping double production of the metal, Reyes said.  
 Gold Production  
 Gold output may gain as the Philippine unit of companies
including  Oceana Gold Ltd.  and Australia's  CGA Mining Ltd.  begin
production of the precious metal, Reyes said.  
 Oceana Gold, which took over rival miner Climax Mining Ltd.
in November, will begin production from its Philippine mine in
central Luzon next year, with an estimated annual output of
100,000 ounces of gold.  
 CGA Mining, which agreed to buy Thistle Mining Inc.'s
Philippine unit, may begin gold production next year, helping
boost the country's output of the precious metal, the Mineral
Economics Office said in a report, without estimating output.  
 New nickel mines may produce 700,000 tons of ore next year,
making up for a slowdown in output of existing mines, it said.  
 Atlas Consolidated Mining & Development Corp., the second-
largest Philippine miner by market value, plans to boost nickel
ore production to 1 million tons in 2008, the company said in
October.  
 All of the company's exports are going to China, Atlas
Executive Vice President  Martin Buckingham  said on Feb. 9. The
company plans to export 45,000 tons to China later this month,
after shipping 19,000 to that country in January, he added.  
 Coral Bay Corp., Sumitomo Metal's Philippine unit doubled
its nickel output to 8,242 tons in 2006 from 4,081 tons in 2005,
according to a government report. Production capacity could rise
to 20,000 tons a year by 2009 with the completion of its second
refinery plant, the company said in March.
