             Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  tomorrow
will begin shipping generic versions of  Merck & Co. (MRK) 's
osteoporosis drug Fosamax, under an agreement with Merck.  
 Merck will make and supply the drug and receive a share of
the profits in the U.S., Watson said today in a statement on PR
Newswire. Further details on the agreement weren't disclosed.  
 Sales of Fosamax dropped 3 percent to $3 billion last year,
Merck reported Jan. 30. The drug is expected to lose market
exclusivity at the close of business tomorrow, according to
Watson, based in Corona, California.  
 Merck expected Fosamax sales to decline by as much as $2
billion this year, the company said in December.
