Dan Carter became the leading points
scorer in Test rugby as top-ranked New Zealand beat Wales 37-25
to complete a sweep of its tour of the U.K. and Ireland.  Fly-half Carter kicked two penalties and three conversions
at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium to lift his tally to 1,188 in
elite international rugby, passing the mark of 1,178 held by
England’s Jonny Wilkinson.  Hosea Gear scored two tries and Mils Muliaina, Isaia Toeava
and John Afoa touched down once as New Zealand completed its
third “Grand Slam” sweep of England, Scotland, Ireland and
Wales in five years. Top-ranked New Zealand has now won 24
straight matches played in November tours of Europe, dating back
to 2002.  World champion South Africa beat England 22-11, Italy
defeated Fiji 24-16, Scotland beat Samoa 19-16 and Australia
routed France 59-16 in today’s other international rugby Test
matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
