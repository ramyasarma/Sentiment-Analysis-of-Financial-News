Chelsea’s Frank Arnesen will become
sporting director at Bundesliga team Hamburg from July, the
German club said on its website.  Former Danish international Arnesen, 54, has overseen
Chelsea’s youth development and academy since joining from
fellow Premier League side Tottenham in 2005.  “I am very happy that we managed to find such a tremendous
solution,” Hamburg Chairman Ernst-Otto Rieckhoff told the
website. “Frank Arnesen has not only gained experience with
several top European clubs, he has also shown that he does
excellent developmental work.”  Chelsea said in November that Arnesen would leave his post
of sporting director at the end of the season. He joins Hamburg
on a three-year contract.  He spent 19 years at  PSV Eindhoven  as a player, assistant
manager and technical director before joining Tottenham in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
