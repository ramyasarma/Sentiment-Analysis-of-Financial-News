Iran’s nuclear power plant in the
southern port city of Bushehr has started operations, Agence
France-Presse said, citing comments by Ali Akbar Salehi, head of
the nation’s Atomic Energy Organization, reported in local
media.  “Without any propaganda and fuss we sealed the cover of 
the reactor and all the fuel rods are in the core of the 
reactor,” Salehi was quoted as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
