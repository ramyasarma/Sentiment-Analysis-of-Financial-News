The regulatory board overseeing the
world’s second-biggest carbon market decided to hand out
tradable emission credits to 12 projects destroying
hydrofluorocarbon-23, a potent greenhouse gas.  The Clean Development Mechanism executive board approved 17
issuances to the projects that it had previously placed under
review, according to an  e-mailed statement today .  About half of all United Nations-overseen credits supplied
since 2005 come from HFC-23-cutting factories, including in
China and India. The gas is a waste product of refrigerant
making. The credits can currently be used for compliance
in the European Union, which this week proposed to ban their use
starting 2013.  The regulator of the United Nations emissions market
deferred a decision on a request, the first of its kind, by
Ineos Group Holdings Ltd. to renew a crediting period at an
HFC-23-cutting factory in Ulsan, South Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
