Tata Group Chairman  Ratan Tata 
called for the Indian government to investigate the sale of
phone licenses that were challenged in an official audit.  “I wish the government would take a stand, bring an
auditor in the thing, have an investigation, book people who are
guilty,” Tata said in an interview with the NDTV television
channel that was aired late yesterday.  The government has come under fire for awarding public
phone licenses at below-market prices in deals that may have
cost the state $31 billion, according to figures calculated by
the country’s chief auditor. The government collected 123.9
billion rupees ($2.7 billion) from the sale of the second-
generation wireless spectrum, the  Comptroller and Auditor
General of India  said in a report to parliament this month.  The auditor said the sale of airwaves “lacked transparency
and was undertaken in an arbitrary, unfair and inequitable
manner,” while Telecommunications Minister Andimuthu Raja has
resigned.  “There has been a smokescreen behind what is really the so-
called scam, which really is out-of-turn allocation of spectrum,
hoarding of spectrum by important players for free, and things
of this nature,” Tata said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
