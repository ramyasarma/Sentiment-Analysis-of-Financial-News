At least three people were shot dead
on the eve of today’s presidential election in the Ivory Coast,
as protesters and police clashed in a suburb of the nation’s
commercial capital of Abidjan, a local official said.  Yves Doumbia, a spokesman for the mayor in the town of
Abobo, said the dead were supporters from the opposition.
Seven people were injured, four of them seriously, he said,
without giving further details.  A five-day curfew was put in effect ahead of the election.
At least six people have been killed in clashes between
opposition supporters and pro-government supporters, most of
them in Abidjan, General Philippe Mangou said in a speech on
state television.  “It is our duty to sound the alarm,” Mangou, head of the
armed forces of Ivory Coast, said. “We don’t want any more
deaths.”  The curfew runs until Dec. 2, he added.  President  Laurent Gbagbo  is facing former Prime Minister
 Alassane Ouattara  in a second-round vote in the West African
country’s first presidential elections in a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
