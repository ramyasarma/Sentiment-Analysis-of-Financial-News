The Ethiopian Roads Authority signed
a contract worth 770 million Ethiopian birr ($46.2 million) for
a Chinese company to build a 97.5-kilometer (60-mile) road, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported, without citing anyone.  Tsugi Civil Engineering Group will build the Yabelo-to-Mega
stretch of asphalt, which is a section of the main road to
Kenya, according to the Addis Ababa-based agency. It is one of
40 roads to be built in the year through July 6, 2011, ENA said.  Chinese companies in Ethiopia have built 41 roads worth 24
billion Ethiopian birr in the past decade, the state-owned
agency reported on Nov. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
