The top-ranked University of
Connecticut defeated Howard University 86-25 to earn its 82nd
consecutive win, setting a National Collegiate Athletic
Association women’s college basketball record.  The Huskies (4-0) broke a tie with Washington University of
St. Louis, a Division III school that had held the record with
81 consecutive wins since Jan. 12, 2001.  Connecticut’s last loss was to Stanford University in the
national semifinals April 26, 2008.  Maya Moore led the Huskies with 20 points, followed by Bria
Hartley with 16 and Stefanie Dolson with 13 points. The Huskies
are hosting the three-day World Vision Classic that started last
