Qantas Airways Ltd.  resumed Airbus
SAS A380 services for the first time since an engine explosion
23 days ago with a superjumbo departing Sydney with Chief
Executive Officer  Alan Joyce  on board.  Flight QF31 bound for London via Singapore took off at
about 5:50 p.m. Sydney time, Qantas spokesman Thomas Woodward
said by phone today.  Qantas, Australia’s largest airline, had grounded its fleet
of six A380s since Nov. 4, when a  Rolls-Royce Group Plc  Trent
900 engine exploded over Indonesia forcing an emergency return
to Singapore. The Sydney-based carrier will put another of the
world’s largest passenger aircraft into service next week as
well as two new jets due from Airbus before Dec. 25.  “What we want to do is show we have full confidence in the
aircraft,” Joyce told reporters at Sydney airport before
boarding the plane to Singapore. “I am comfortable with every
Qantas operation that takes place. We are always going to
operate with 100 percent safety in mind.”  The airline has begun modifying as many as 16 Trent 900s
and won’t return planes powered by them to service until
completing inspections with Airbus, regulators and Rolls-Royce.  Qantas configures its A380s for  450 passengers  and the jets
represent 17 percent of its international capacity. Joyce leased
aircraft and redeployed Boeing Co. 747s and other widebody jets
to meet the airlines’ schedule during the grounding.  The carrier, which is due to receive two new A380s in 2011,
uses the jets on long-haul routes to Europe and North America.  Qantas hasn’t put an estimate on the cost of the
disruptions and while it may seek compensation from London-based
Rolls-Royce, Joyce said it’s too early to say what that might be.  The carrier’s  shares  have declined 7 percent since Nov. 3
compared with a 2.6 percent fall in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200
index. The stock closed unchanged at A$2.67 on Nov. 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
