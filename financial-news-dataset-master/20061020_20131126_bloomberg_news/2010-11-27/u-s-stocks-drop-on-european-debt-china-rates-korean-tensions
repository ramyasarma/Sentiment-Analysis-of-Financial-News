U.S. stocks fell this week, led by
banks, amid concern that an Irish financial bailout will fail to
stem Europe’s debt crisis, China will raise interest rates to
cool inflation and the Korean peninsula conflict will escalate.  “Those things paint a pretty grave image,” said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps oversee $13.8 billion at Huntington Asset
Advisors in Cincinnati. “They serve to keep the real
fundamental investors on the sidelines because they’re reasons
not to take a risk.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and Bank of America Corp. led declines
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, both losing more than 4.6
percent, after Ireland became the second euro country to seek a
rescue as the cost of saving its banks threatened a rerun of the
Greek debt crisis. Hewlett-Packard Co. limited losses for the
benchmark, rising after its profit forecast exceeded estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.9 percent this week
to 1,189.40 as 8 of 10 industry groups declined. The Dow lost 1
percent to 11,092, with 25 of its 30 companies falling. Both
equity gauges are up more than 6.3 percent this year.  Financial companies  led the S&P 500 lower, losing 2.5
percent for the biggest decline among 10 industry groups. S&P
Ratings Services lowered the long-term counterparty credit
rating on Irish banks including Allied Irish Banks Plc and Bank
of Ireland Plc.  Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 4.6
percent to $11.12. JPMorgan, the second-biggest, slid 4.8
percent to $37.50. Citigroup Inc. decreased 3.7 percent to $4.11.  Korean Clashes  The  S&P 500  posted its biggest drop of the week on Nov. 23,
losing 1.4 percent after fighting broke out among North and
South Korea. North Korea shelled a South Korean island near the
disputed border between the two countries, killing two soldiers
in the worst attack on its neighbor in at least eight months.  China’s government in the past month has stepped up a
campaign to limit credit expansion after inflation quickened and
property prices surged. China’s  biggest banks  are poised to
reach government-set caps on lending and plan to stop expanding
their loan books to avoid exceeding the annual quotas, four
people with knowledge of the matter said this week.  “If you take those things together you’ve got headline-
grabbing negatives in China, Ireland and Korea,” said  Stephen Wood , the New York-based chief market strategist for Russell
Investments, which manages $149 billion. “They’ve drowned out
the positives of improving employment numbers and corporate
earnings in the U.S.”  Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest computer maker,
advanced 1.7 percent to $43.20. The Palo-Alto, California-based
company forecast first-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’
estimates as corporations step up buying of personal computers,
printers, servers and networking gear.  Monster Rallies  Monster Worldwide Inc., operator of the www.monster.com
job-search site, gained 17 percent to $23.18 for the biggest
jump in the S&P 500 after a Labor Department report showed a
drop in applications for unemployment benefits. Jobless  claims 
last week fell by 34,000 to 407,000, the lowest level since July
2008.  The benchmark index for U.S. stock  options  rose the most
since May. The  VIX , as the  Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index  is known, increased 23 percent to 22.22. The
index, which measures the cost of using options to protect
against  S&P 500  declines, has rebounded from a six-month low of
18.04 last week.  The Treasury will sell $29 billion in three-month and $28
billion in six-month bills on Nov. 29. They yielded 0.15 percent
and 0.21 percent, respectively, in when-issued trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
