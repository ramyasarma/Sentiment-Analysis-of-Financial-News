Mike Hussey and Brad Haddin hit
centuries to lift Australia to a 221-run first-innings lead over
England on day three of the series-opening Ashes cricket Test in
Brisbane.  Hussey scored a Test-best 195, while Haddin struck 136 in a
307-run game-changing partnership that was the highest in elite
Tests at the Gabba.  Steven Finn finished as England’s best bowler, taking six
wickets for 125, as Australia made 481 in reply to England’s
score of 260 on the opening day.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
