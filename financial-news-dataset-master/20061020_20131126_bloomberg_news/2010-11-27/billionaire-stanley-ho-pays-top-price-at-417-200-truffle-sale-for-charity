Stanley Ho , a Macau billionaire,
paid the top price in an international white-truffle auction
that raised a total of $417,200.  The highest bid during Saturday’s sale, held simultaneously
in London, Rome and Macau, was $330,000 for two pieces of the
rare tuber weighing a total 1.3 kilograms (2.87 pounds). It came
in Macau on behalf of Ho, chairman of  SJM Holdings Ltd ., Asia’s
biggest listed casino operator by sales, according to one of the
organizers of the London event, Bruno Giorgi.  “It was fun,” said Piers Boothman, associate director of
 Christie’s International , the London auctioneer at Franco’s
restaurant, on Jermyn Street. “Most of the bidding came from
Macau, but we contributed here as well.”  Truffle prices are boosted by the charitable element at
sales such as this. Ho’s bid was for a 900 gram truffle from
Tuscany and a 400 gram truffle from Molise. The top winning bid 
in London -- $7,000, for five truffles, weighing a total of 274
grams -- came via telephone from a French group, Giorgi said. He
wouldn’t identify the bidders.  The auction followed a four-course lunch in London, where
diners enjoyed Italian white truffle with porcini and quail
eggs; white truffle risotto; veal entrecote with white-truffle
potato puree; and Prosecco-poached pears with white-truffle
zabaglione. Tickets to the sale cost 150 pounds ($234).  Bidding was relayed via satellite from  Don Alfonso 1890 
restaurant in Macau; and La Pergola, in Rome.  Proceeds from the sale go to the charity picked by each
location. The Hambro family, which owns Franco’s, chose the
Institute of Cancer Research in London.  In 2007, a record $330,000 was paid by Ho for a 1.5
kilogram white truffle. The artist  Damien Hirst  was among the
unsuccessful bidders. In 2008, the largest truffle of the year,
1.08 kilograms, sold at the international auction for $200,000.  To contact the writer on the story:
