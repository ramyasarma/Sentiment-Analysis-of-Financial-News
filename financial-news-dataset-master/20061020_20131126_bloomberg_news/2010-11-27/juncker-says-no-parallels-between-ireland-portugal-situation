Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said
Portugal’s situation is different from that of Ireland, which
last week sought international aid, Belgian newspaper L’Echo
reported.  “There are no parallels whatsoever between Ireland and
Portugal,” Juncker said in an interview to be published in
today’s edition. “The budgetary reform plan Portugal put on the
table is quite consistent. And the banking sector shows signs of
robustness.”  Portuguese bonds  have dropped as the government struggles
to convince investors it can avoid the fate of Ireland and
Greece, which have asked for European Union bailouts this year.
Portuguese Finance Minister  Fernando Teixeira  dos Santos said
yesterday that governments can’t impose a bailout on his country
after the Financial Times Deutschland reported that it’s being
forced to seek aid  On the question of extending the European Financial
Stability Facility, Juncker said that “even if some could see
it as wise to prolong the existence of this mechanism, some
member nations see that differently.” He said that he favours
the creation of a permanent crisis mechanism.  Juncker also told the newspaper “it’s not correct to say”
that bank stress tests conducted earlier this year on Europe’s
financial institutions were “unconvincing.”  “What happened in Ireland is that the banks are not able
anymore to manage the consequences of the bursting of the
property bubble, which wasn’t a working hypothesis” in the last
tests, said Juncker in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
