Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  and his Chinese counterpart,  Yang Jiechi , called for
efforts to prevent further escalation on the Korean peninsula.  The two men also stressed the need “to work toward easing
the tension between the two Korean parties as well as for a
resumption of six-party talks” in a telephone conversation
today, according to an e-mailed statement from the Foreign
Ministry in Moscow.  The U.S. aircraft carrier USS George Washington and four
smaller warships begin exercises tomorrow with South Korean
vessels in a show of force that North Korea warned will take the
peninsula to the “brink of war.” The drills, to be held in the
waters west of the Korean peninsula, follow North Korea’s Nov.
23 attack on a South Korean fishing community and military base
that killed four people, including two civilians.  Earlier this week, Lavrov condemned the North Korea
shelling while saying that South Korea had ignored a request to
cancel military exercises. Yang called on North Korea and South
Korea to remain calm, exercise restraint and resolve the
situation through dialogue, China’s Foreign Ministry said on its
website yesterday.  Both Russia and China share a border with North Korea.
China is North Korea’s main economic and political benefactor
and the two countries fought together against U.S.-led United
Nations forces during the 1950-1953 Korean War. The peninsula
remains in a technical state of war since the conflict ended in
a cease-fire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
