A Russian-made cargo plane crashed
into a housing complex in the Pakistani city of Karachi shortly
after take-off, Sultan Hasan, a spokesman for Pakistan
International Airlines said.  The Ilyshin IL-76 plane was carrying eight people on board
who were all probably Russian, Civil Aviation spokesman Pervez
George said. The incident occurred at 1:45 a.m. Karachi time,
one minute after the aircraft took off on flight to Sudan
carrying tents.  Five bodies have been recovered from the crash site, said
Muhammad Yasir, a spokesman for the Edhi Foundation, Pakistan’s
largest rescue service. The aircraft crashed on houses that were
under construction so casualties are likely to be minimum,
police inspector Shad Ibn-e-Masih said.  The crash caused a blaze in the Dalmai neighborhood, Agence
France-Presse reported, citing officials and witnesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
