Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” for the sixth straight day in the Central business
district, the Environmental Protection Department said on
its website. The index reached 109 in Central and 105 in Mongkok
as of 7 a.m., it said. Readings over 100 are classified as “very
high” and trigger a government warning for people with heart or
respiratory illnesses to avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic
areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
