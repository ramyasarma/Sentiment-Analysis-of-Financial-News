Romania beat Uruguay 39-12 to seal
the 20th and final berth at the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New
Zealand.  The win in Bucharest gave Romania a 60-33 victory over the
home-and-away playoff following a 21-21 draw in Montevideo two
weeks ago.  Romania extended its record of playing at all seven
editions of the sport’s four-yearly championship and advances to
Pool B at next year’s tournament alongside Argentina, England,
Scotland and Georgia.  Romania joins Canada, Georgia, Japan, Namibia, Russia,
Samoa and the U.S. as the eight successful teams from a
qualifying process involving 80 nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
