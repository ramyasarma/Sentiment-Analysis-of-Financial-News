Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis
Rodriguez Zapatero pledged to push through wide-ranging changes
to his country’s economy “as fast as possible” as he battled
to persuade bond investors to keep financing his administration.  “The government has committed to continue with reforms,”
Zapatero said in a televised press conference after meeting
Spanish business leaders including Banco Santander SA Chairman
Emilio Botin in Madrid today. The changes “will make us more
productive and change our economic model to become more
competitive.”  The premier said the changes he plans will affect the
country’s labor market rules, its pension system and its energy
supply as well as increasing competition among companies
providing goods and services. Spanish government bond yields
surged last week after the Irish government asked for a
financial rescue package.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
