             SAIC Inc. (SAI) , the San Diego-based defense
company, won a contract valued at as much as $80 million from the
 General Services Administration  to provide translation services
to the Defense Department and other U.S. agencies.  
 Most of initial support will be for the Pentagon, said Laura Luke, a SAIC spokeswoman, in an interview. The five-year contract
features options that could extend the work 15 years.  
 SAIC will translate documents and provide interpreters and
language training to government personnel in the U.S. and abroad,
it in a statement. The agreement may also call for sign-language
services. SAIC had $8.94 billion in sales last year.  
 SAIC gained 8 cents to $18.61 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 7.5 percent
this year.
