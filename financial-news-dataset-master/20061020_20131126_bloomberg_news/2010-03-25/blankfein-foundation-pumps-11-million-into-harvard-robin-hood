             From the roughly $240 million  Lloyd Blankfein  received in salary, bonuses and stock awards at
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc . during the past decade, about $11.3
million went to Harvard University, the  Robin Hood Foundation ,
the  UJA-Federation of New York  and several dozen other
philanthropic targets.  
 Donations by the Lloyd & Laura Blankfein Foundation, a
nonprofit run by the Goldman chief executive officer and his
wife, Laura Jacobs Blankfein, cover the period 2000 to January
2009 and average about $1.3 million a year, according to the
organization’s tax filings.  
 During that period, Blankfein’s compensation included an
annual salary of $600,000 and $125.6 million in cash bonuses. As
of March 8, he owned 3.37 million shares of Goldman stock worth
$587.8 million at yesterday’s closing. Blankfein declined
multiple requests for an interview about his philanthropy
through Goldman spokesman  Joseph Snodgrass .  
 “Philanthropists are motivated to create a family
foundation because it allows you to be fairly strategic and
focused when making gifts,” said Patrick Rooney, executive
director of the  Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University , in
a phone interview. “It also gives you a way to say ‘No, this
area isn’t our focus.’”  
 After Blankfein and Goldman Sachs were criticized for
setting aside a near-record $16.7 billion to pay employees in
the first nine months of the year, the firm subtracted $519
million in the fourth quarter and used $500 million to fund a
charitable contribution. In 2007, he received a cash bonus,
stock and options valued at $69.3 million on top of his annual
salary, and he got no bonus in 2008.  
 Robin Hood  
 Robin Hood, a poverty-fighting organization led by  David Saltzman , received gifts from Blankfein ranging from $23,350 in
2002 to two donations totaling $850,000 in 2006, the year
Blankfein became Goldman’s CEO. He is also a Robin Hood trustee.  
 Harvard, where Blankfein attended college and  law school ,
has been a regular recipient of large and small gifts, including
$1 million in 2000 and $1.7 million in 2006 for “general
purposes.” He also gave $25,000 to the university’s parents
fund in both 2007 and 2008 and $10,000 to the law school’s fund
three years ago.  
 Manhattan’s  Ethical Culture Fieldston School , from which
Laura Blankfein graduated in 1971, received $435,000 in 2008 and
$200,000 in 2006. The Blankfeins’ sons, Alex and Jonathan, both
attended Ethical Culture and Harvard.  
 Medical organizations are well represented on the
Blankfeins’ gift lists with the Weill Cornell Medical Center
getting $100,000 in 2007 and 2008. The foundation gave $25,000
to the  New York University Child Study Center  in 2007 and $1,000
to both the Israel Cancer Research Fund and the  Alliance for
Lupus Research .  
 Roundabout  
 The Blankfeins handed out several dozen small and medium-
size gifts to a range of organizations, including the  Roundabout
Theater Co . ($10,000), the  Harlem School of the Arts  ($500), the
American Stroke Association ($262), the West Side Little League
($800) and the Bridgehampton, New York, fire department ($1,000).  
 Usually, high-net-worth individuals and top Wall Street
executives launch a foundation with a portion of their wealth
and eventually “populate” it with their children or
grandchildren, Rooney said.  
 “Two of my children are on my foundation board, and I will
pass on to them sufficient funds so that they can have the fun
and experience of giving away money as I have been fortunate
enough to do,”  John Whitehead , Goldman’s co-chairman in the
1980s and a philanthropist, said in a phone interview.  
 Other Sources  
 The Blankfein foundation’s gift lists probably don’t
reflect all the charitable giving done by the couple, said
 Melissa Berman , chief executive officer of Rockefeller
Philanthropy Advisors. Many philanthropists also use donor-
advised funds and write gifts from personal checking or
brokerage accounts, she said.  
 Peter Firestein , president of Global Strategic
Communications in New York, which advises companies on image
issues, said the Blankfein foundation’s giving would be “more
impressive” if it had taken the “initiative to accomplish
something” significant. He notes that junk-bond pioneer  Michael Milken ’s foundation has raised more than $200 million for cancer
research and funds several education and scholarship programs.  
 “ Sandy Weill  has given $100 million gifts to Weill Cornell
Medical College, and he’s given credit for saving Carnegie
Hall,” Firestein said about the Citigroup Inc. chairman
emeritus. “Milken and Weill not only wrote checks but they
conceived and advanced specific initiatives with their energy
and influence. So perhaps something like this lies in Lloyd
Blankfein’s future.”
