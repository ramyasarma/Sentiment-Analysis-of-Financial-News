             RBC Capital Markets hired  John Brady 
and four other bankers to expand its U.S. investment-banking
business in New York.  
 Brady was named co-head of U.S. real estate, the Toronto-
based firm said in an e-mailed statement today. Brady, who last
served as an executive partner at Menlo Park, California-based
private equity firm GI Partners, has 25 years experience
including posts at Merrill Lynch & Co. and UBS AG, where he was
co-head of the Americas lodging and real estate group.  
 RBC Capital Markets is expanding investment-banking
services to become a top-10 firm in the U.S. The unit of  Royal
Bank of Canada , the country’s largest lender, has hired more
than 100 bankers in the U.S. this year to boost coverage of
industries including restructuring and aerospace, and areas such
as mergers and leveraged finance.  
 RBC also hired former JPMorgan Chase managing director  Marc Berman  as head of its insurance group and Jay Broaddus, a former
Barclays Capital banker who last worked at Cantor Fitzgerald, as
managing director for the consumer group.  Grant Tolson  was hired
as a director in the insurance group, and  Marc Layne  as director
for technology business.
