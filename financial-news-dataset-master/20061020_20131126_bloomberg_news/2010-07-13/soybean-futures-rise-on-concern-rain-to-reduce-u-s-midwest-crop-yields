             Soybeans rose for the fourth time in
five sessions on speculation that heavy Midwest rainfall during
the past six weeks will reduce yields in the U.S., the world’s
largest grower and exporter.  
 About 65 percent of the  crop  was rated good or excellent on
July 11, down from 66 percent a year earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Conditions
deteriorated in Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and Ohio. Those
states accounted for 44 percent of the 2009 record harvest, USDA
data show.  
 “Soybean crop conditions fell below last year, and that is
a positive factor” for prices, said  Greg Grow , the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
“The crop is getting smaller.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 5.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $9.565 a bushel at 10:16 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Yesterday, the price reached $9.6075, the
highest level for the most-active contract since May 14. Before
today, the oilseed gained 5.4 percent this month.  
 U.S. inventories totaled 571 million bushels as of June 1,
down 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the government said on
June 30. That marked the lowest level since 2004. Reserves will
fall to 175 million bushels, 5.4 percent less than June’s
forecast, the USDA said last week.  
 “Soybean supplies are tight,” Grow said. “There is
little margin for crop problems this year.”  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at 31.8 billion, government figures
show.
