             Pacific Investment Management Co.,
which runs the world’s largest bond fund, said investors should
avoid so-called euro periphery nations such as Greece, Portugal,
Spain and Italy as they struggle to cope with their sovereign
debt burdens.  
 Investors should favor nations that have policy
flexibility, David Fisher, Pimco’s head of global product
management, said on a conference call from Tokyo today. The U.S.
is among nations that have to some extent used up their “spare
tire” and so it also lacks the capacity to respond to any fresh
difficulties, Fisher said.
