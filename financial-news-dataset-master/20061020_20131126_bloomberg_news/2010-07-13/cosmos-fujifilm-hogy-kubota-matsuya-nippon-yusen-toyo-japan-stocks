             Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
fell 10.88, or 0.1 percent, to 9,537.23 as of the close in
Tokyo. The following were among the most active shares in the
Japanese  market  today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after

 Chiyoda Integre Co.  (6915 JT) declined 3.7 percent to 1,106
yen. The electronic-components maker said nine-month net income
fell 40 percent to 308 million yen ($3.5 million).  
 East Japan Railway Co.  (9020 JT) sank 2.7 percent to 5,830
