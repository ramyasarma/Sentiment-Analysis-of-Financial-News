             Swiss stocks rose for a sixth day as
Alcoa Inc. posted quarterly earnings that beat estimates and a
debt sale by Greece eased concern that the nation faces punitive
costs to borrow.  
 SGS SA  increased 3.8 percent as JPMorgan Chase & Co. said
that first-half results may “act as a positive catalyst.”
 Holcim Ltd.  followed construction shares higher.  Lonza Group AG 
advanced 3.1 percent after signing an agreement with Human
Genome Sciences Inc.  Partners Group Holding AG  surged 2.1
percent as assets under management rose 3 percent in the first
six months of the year.  
 The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  rose 70.28, or 1.1
percent, to 6,298.59. The gauge has still retreated 9.6 percent
from this year’s high on April 15 amid speculation that Europe’s
debt crisis may derail the economic recovery and concern that
Chinese authorities are cooling the nation’s growth. The broader
 Swiss Performance Index  also gained 1.1 percent today.  
 “It will be interesting to see if this earnings season has
more of an impact on the market than the last one,”  Gary Jenkins , a strategist at Evolution Securities Ltd. in London,
wrote in a note today. “When first quarter earnings were being
released the market was focused on the concerns regarding
sovereign debt rather than the fundamentals of corporates.”  
 Topped Projections  
 Alcoa , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, reported second-
quarter profit that topped analysts’ projections as higher metal
prices boosted sales. Earnings from continuing operations were
13 cents a share, exceeding the 11-cent average estimate of 17
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.      Greece sold 1.63 billion
euros ($2.05 billion) of 26-week Treasury bills at a yield of
4.65 percent, the debt agency said today. That’s below the 5
percent charged by the European Union for its bailout package.
Investors bid for 3.64 times the securities offered.  
 SGS increased 3.8 percent to 1,550 francs. JPMorgan raised
its price estimate on the world’s biggest goods inspector to
1,524 francs from 1,507 francs. The brokerage said that first-
half results, due July 15, may “act as a positive catalyst.”  
 Holcim , the world’s second-biggest cement maker, gained 2.7
percent to 70.95 francs as construction stocks were among the
best performers in Europe today.  
 Lonza rose 3.1 percent to 71.9 francs. Human Genome
Sciences and Lonza announced an agreement for the future
commercial supply of Benlysta, which is currently under
regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe as a potential new
treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus.  
 Partners Rises  
 Partners Group gained 2.1 percent to 138.8 francs. The
money manager focused on private equity investments said assets
under management rose 3 percent in the first six months of the
year on higher client inflows.  
 Assets increased to 26.5 billion Swiss francs ($25 billion)
from 25.7 billion francs at the end of December. The company
raised 3 billion francs in new assets and boosted its estimate
for client inflows to between 5 billion francs and 5.5 billion
francs this year.  
 “Against substantial currency headwinds, operating
performance continues to thrive and positively surprise,”
Kepler Capital Markets said in a note.  
 Swatch Group AG , the maker of Omega and Breguet timepieces,
increased 3.1 percent to 318.6 francs.  Cie. Financiere Richemont
SA , the world’s biggest jewelry maker, rose 3.1 percent to 40.28
francs.  
 Lindt & Spruengli AG  shares advanced 0.6 percent to 26,815
francs as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded the chocolate maker
to “neutral” from “sell”  
 Addex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  climbed 10 percent to 10.4
francs after the pharmaceutical company said that its
preclinical drug candidate ADX71943 was effective in a model of
osteoarthritis pain.
