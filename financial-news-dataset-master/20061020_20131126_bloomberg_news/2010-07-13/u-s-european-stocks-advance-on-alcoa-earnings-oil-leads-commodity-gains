             U.S. and European stocks climbed for
a sixth day, commodities rallied and Treasuries declined as
Alcoa Inc.’s forecast of growing global demand and Greece’s sale
of debt bolstered optimism in the economic outlook.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.5 percent to
1,097.37 at 4 p.m. in New York, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
closed up 1.9 percent. Oil surged 2.9 percent, recouping
yesterday’s loss, and the S&P GSCI Index of commodities jumped
2.2 percent. Ten-year Treasury yields rose six basis points to
3.12 percent for a fifth straight gain, the longest streak in 11
months. The euro increased 0.9 percent to top $1.27.
