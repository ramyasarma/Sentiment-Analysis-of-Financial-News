             Brazil said it started drilling a
second well at its offshore Libra oil field after a “mechanical
problem” forced it to abandon a previous attempt to assess the
size of the deepwater reserves.  
 Drilling of a new well about 370 meters (1,214 feet) away
from the first began last week, the press office of the ANP oil
regulator said today in an e-mailed response to questions. The
ANP said in May, when the first well was started, that it would
take about five months to complete.  
 Brazil’s government is exploring an area known as the pre-
salt region as part of a plan to swap oil reserves for  new
shares  in state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA. Libra, in the
Santos Basin, sits near the offshore Franco field, which holds
the reserves the government plans to use to buy the stock.  
 Seismic data indicates that Libra may be larger than
Franco, which has an estimated 4.5 billion barrels of
recoverable oil,  Magda Chambriard , an ANP director, said in May.  
 Petrobras plans to invest $224 billion dollars over the
next five years to expand production at deposits including the
pre-salt Tupi field, the largest discovery in the Americas since
Mexico’s Cantarell in 1976. Petrobras aims to raise as much as
$25 billion from minority investors in a September share sale to
help fund investments. The government will buy shares with oil,
not cash, to maintain  control  of the producer.
