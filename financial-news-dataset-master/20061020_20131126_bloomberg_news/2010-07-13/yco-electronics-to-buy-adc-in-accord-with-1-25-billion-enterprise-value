             Tyco Electronics Ltd. , the world’s
biggest maker of electronic connectors, agreed to buy  ADC
Telecommunications Inc.  for about $1.25 billion to add broadband
equipment that helps companies connect to the Internet.  
 Tyco Electronics will pay $12.75 a share, or 44 percent
more than Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based ADC’s closing stock
price yesterday, according to a statement today. The purchase
will bolster Tyco Electronics’ profit by 14 cents a share in the
first year, the Schaffhausen, Switzerland-based company said.  
 The acquisition will bolster Tyco Electronics’ presence in
the network solution business as ADC adds equipment that
provides connections to the Internet and products that help
companies expand wireless networks.  
 “It makes them one of the bigger, leading global providers
of broadband connectivity,” said  Amit Daryanani , an analyst
with RBC Capital Markets in New York. “It basically doubles the
size they have in the network solutions business.”  
 Tyco Electronics  rose  $1.05, or 4.2 percent, to $26.33 at
11:52 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . Before
today, the shares had  advanced  3 percent this year. ADC advanced
$3.68, or 42 percent, to $12.53 on the Nasdaq Stock Market and
had gained 43 percent in 2010.  
 Technology Bubble  
 Tyco Electronics was spun off from Tyco International Ltd.
in 2007. The acquisition would be Tyco Electronics’ largest
since it became a standalone company.  
 The company today also reported preliminary fiscal third-
quarter adjusted profit of 70 cents a share, according to the
statement. Analysts predicted 63 cents, the average of 11
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales for the quarter ended
June 25 were about $3.1 billion, up 23 percent from a year ago.
Tyco Electronics expects to report complete results on July 22.  
 Barclays Plc and law firm  Davis Polk and Wardwell  advised
Tyco Electronics on the deal.  Morgan Stanley  advised ADC and
 Dorsey & Whitney  served as the legal advisers.  
 ADC’s shares fell from a high of $329.44 in 2000 after
telecommunications customers cut back orders, and the technology
bubble burst at the beginning of the decade.  
 ADC Chief Executive Officer Robert Switz, 63, has said the
company will report sales growth in the second half of this year
as phone companies invest in a new generation of network
technology and add capacity to wireless networks.
