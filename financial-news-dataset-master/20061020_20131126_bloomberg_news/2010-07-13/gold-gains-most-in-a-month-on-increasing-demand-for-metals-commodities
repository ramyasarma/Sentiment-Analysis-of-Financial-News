             Gold prices rose the most in three
weeks on speculation that a recovery in the global economy will
boost demand for commodities.  
 U.S. equities rallied for the sixth straight session after
Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, reported profit
that topped analysts’ estimates. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index
of 19 raw materials rose as much as 1.5 percent. Gold has gained
11 percent this year.  
 “Gold is rallying on the heels of positive sentiment,”
said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “We see strength in a host of
commodities. This is a positive correlation with equities.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery rose $14.80, or 1.2
percent, to $1,213.50 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since June 17.  
 Yesterday, the price settled below $1,200 for the fourth
time in five sessions.  
 “Gold tried repeatedly to break down below $1,200, but the
buyers kept coming back,” said  Matt Zeman , a trader at LaSalle
Futures Group in Chicago. “This is a short-covering rally.”  
 Yesterday, assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded fund backed by bullion, rose 0.3 metric ton to
1,314.82 tons, marking the first increase since June 29.  
 Portugal’s Debt Rating  
 Gold also rallied after Portugal’s debt rating was cut two
levels to A1. Moody’s Investors Service cited the country’s
growing debt burden and weak economic prospects. The metal
reached a record $1,266.50 on June 21 and all-time highs in
euros, U.K. pounds and Swiss francs last month amid Europe’s
credit crisis.  
 “The downgrade is a signal to the market that the
situation is not over,” said  Bernard Sin , the head of currency
and metal trading at bullion-refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva.
“There is still long-term fear because of uncertainty.”  
 Silver futures for September delivery jumped 34 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $18.257 an ounce.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery gained $20.10, or 1.3
percent, to $1,535.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery surged $15, or 3.3
percent, to $469.15 an ounce.
