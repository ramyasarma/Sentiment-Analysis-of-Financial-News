             China attracted more asset financing
in clean-energy technology in the second quarter than Europe and
the U.S. combined, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  
 Financing of wind turbines, solar panels and low-carbon
technology in China climbed 72 percent to $11.5 billion compared
with the year-earlier quarter, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said
in an e-mailed statement. U.S. investments in clean energy rose
to $4.9 billion while in Europe it fell to $4.5 billion.  
 “China continues its extraordinary surge and Europe has
suffered a setback according to our figures for asset finance in
the second quarter,” said  Michael Liebreich , chief executive of
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “Where investors are placing their 
bets is changing rapidly.”  
 China’s $586 billion stimulus program, implemented last
year and still being spent, and economic growth boosted
industrial output and energy demand. The world’s most populous
nation installed 14 gigawatts of new wind power last year, more
than any other country.  
 Asset financing typically accounts for just under two-
thirds of all new funds invested in clean energy in a given
year. In the first half, it reached $58.4 billion, a 21 percent
gain over the same period a year earlier.  
 Total new investment in clean energy worldwide, including
share sales, venture capital, private equity and asset finance,
slipped 3 percent to $33.9 billion in the second quarter from
the same period last year.
