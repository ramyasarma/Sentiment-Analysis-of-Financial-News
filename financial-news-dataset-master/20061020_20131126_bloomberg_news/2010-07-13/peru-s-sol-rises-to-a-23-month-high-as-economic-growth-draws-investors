             Peru’s sol rose to a 23-month high
as investors bet that growth in South America’s sixth-largest
economy will spur the local currency to keep strengthening.  
 The sol climbed 0.3 percent to 2.8158 per U.S. dollar at
3:29 p.m. New York time, from 2.8235 yesterday. The sol reached
its strongest level since Aug. 7, 2008.  
 Peru may post annual growth of 9 percent in May, according
to the median estimate of 14 economists  surveyed by Bloomberg .
That would be the second-highest figure in 19 months. The
national statistics office is scheduled to announce May output
on July 15. The central bank, which projects 6.6 percent growth
for this year, raised its  reference rate  for a third straight
month last week to keep inflation under control.  
 “There is more foreign direct investment in Peru, so
you’ll probably see the sol appreciate further,” said  Vicente Tuesta , head of research at Lima-based Prima AFP. “Long-term
investment projects guarantee sustainable economic growth
without the need for public spending.”  
 Projects totaling $35 billion may be undertaken by 2012,
led by investments in mining, oil and gas,  Ricardo Briceno ,
president of Peru’s largest business group, Confiep, said in a
July 6 interview.  
 The central bank didn’t  intervene  in the foreign exchange
market today, it said on its website.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 5.51 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s local
unit.
