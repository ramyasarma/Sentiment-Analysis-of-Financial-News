             India, the world’s second-biggest
vegetable oil consumer after China, may boost imports of palm
and soybean oils to meet rising demand during festivals amid a
drop in domestic inventories.  
 Purchases in the three months ending Oct. 31 may jump as
much as 24 percent to 2.6 million metric tons from a year ago,
 Govindlal G. Patel , director of Dipak Enterprise, said in a
phone interview today.  
 Increased demand from India may push up palm oil prices in
Malaysia by 20 percent to 2,800 ringgit a ton by November, said
Patel, a vegetable oils trader for more than four decades. The
country overtook China as the biggest buyer of the commodity in
2009, helping the edible oil to a 57 percent annual gain.  
 “India will need incremental supplies to meet demand as
there’s little available in terms of local supplies,” said  Amol Tilak , analyst at Kotak Commodity Services Ltd. “Crushers are
not processing oilseeds because of high domestic seed prices.”  
 September-delivery palm oil advanced as much as 0.6 percent
to 2,353 ringgit ($734) a ton, reversing an earlier loss.  
 China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia, Asia’s most-populous
countries, mark their important festivals in the quarter ending
September, with communal meals stoking edible oils consumption.
Malaysia’s palm oil inventories fell to a 10-month low in June.  
 Palm oil purchases by India may top 500,000 tons on  average 
each month through October, with soybean oil imports at 200,000
tons to 250,000 tons, Patel said. Sunflower oil shipments may be
50,000 tons each month, he said. China may import about 200,000
tons of soybean oil each month from July to September, the
portal Grain.gov.cn said in a report today.  
 Ramadan Demand  
 “Palm oil demand will pick up from now on as soybean’s
premium is increasing and buying for Ramadan demand begins,”
Patel said. “That will be supportive for prices.”  
 Soybean oil’s premium  over palm oil was $112.8 a ton today,
higher than the average $89.86 so far this year, according to
Bloomberg data. The edible oils are direct substitutes.  
 India’s vegetable oil imports dropped 26 percent to 558,765
tons in May from 751,097 tons a year earlier, the fifth monthly
decline, as buyers pared inventories, the Solvent Extractors’
Association of India said June 15.  
 Palm oil makes up almost 80 percent of the nation’s edible
oil purchases.  
 Inventories of edible oils at Indian ports have fallen 35
percent to about 550,000 tons at the end of June from about
845,000 tons in February, Patel said. Stocks of soybeans total
3.1 million tons and rapeseed 3.7 million tons, he said.  
 Cooking oil imports in June probably dropped 11 percent to
660,000 tons from 742,000 tons a year earlier, he said.  
 The area sown with soybean may drop to 7.3 percent to 8.9
million hectares this year, as farmers in the states of Madhya
Pradesh and Maharashtra, the biggest growers, switch to more
profitable crops such as cotton and lentils, Patel said.
