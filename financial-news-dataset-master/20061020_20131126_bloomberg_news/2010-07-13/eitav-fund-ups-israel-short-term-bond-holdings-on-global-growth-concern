             Meitav Mutual Fund Management
increased its short-term government bond holdings amid growing
concern about the global economic recovery and stepped up bets
that interest rate increases will be delayed.  
 Meitav’s Government Bonds Fund, with about 245 million
shekels ($63 million) under management, “increased exposure”
to short-term bonds last week on speculation the spread with
long-term securities will widen,  Jonathan Haddad , an analyst at
the division of Tel Aviv-based Meitav Investment House Ltd. said
by telephone. He declined to specify how much or which bonds
were bought.  
 “There is growing uncertainty in the global markets and
investors are moving to the safest possible government debt
instruments,” Haddad said by telephone. “There is also a
growing consensus that the Bank of Israel will delay interest
rate increases, boosting shorter-term bonds.”  
 The 10-year Mimshal Shiklit maturing in January 2020
slipped 0.02 shekel to 104.37 at the close in Tel Aviv, with the
yield on the 5 percent notes rising one basis point to 4.72
percent. The yield on the bond due March 2012 was at 2.54
percent.  
 The spread between the two securities narrowed three basis
points today to 218 after widening 14 basis points this month.
Two-year notes are among the most sensitive to local rates
because of their short maturity.  
 Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  on June 28 held the
benchmark interest rate at 1.5 percent for a third month citing
increased uncertainties in the global economy, particularly in
Europe, and their effect on Israel’s economy. Growth this year
may be below the central bank’s official 3.7 percent forecast on
lower than forecast export data, Fischer said July 1.  
 The shekel strengthened 0.2 percent to 3.8585 per dollar at
4:51 p.m. in Tel Aviv from 3.8660 yesterday.
