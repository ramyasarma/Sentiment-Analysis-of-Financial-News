             ERG SpA may exercise a put option on
the Priolo refinery in Italy that involves Russia’s OAO Lukoil,
Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Garrone told Il Sole 24 Ore
in an interview.  
 ERG in 2008 agreed to sell Lukoil 49 percent of a new
company that would control the refinery, on the island of
Sicily. ERG’s option, which would force Lukoil to purchase its
stake, is valid until 2014.
