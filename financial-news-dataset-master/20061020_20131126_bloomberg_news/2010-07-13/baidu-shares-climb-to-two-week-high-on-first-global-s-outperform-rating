             Baidu Inc. , the operator of China’s
most-used Internet search engine, rose to the  highest price  in
two weeks after First Global rated the shares “outperform” in
new coverage.  
 Baidu climbed 5.2 percent to $74.38, the highest price
since June 28. The company has climbed 81 percent this year.  
 “The expected growth momentum in online advertising,
increased penetration of Internet and broadband connectivity,
Baidu’s market leadership in Chinese Internet search, and its
high return ratios” are all “great positives,”  Devina Mehra ,
First Global chief strategist, wrote in a report today. “Baidu
is expected to benefit the most if Google makes an exit from
China.”  
 Google Inc.  won the renewal of its Web-service license in
China last week, defusing a six-month standoff with the
government over censorship.  
 Baidu’s market share in the first quarter increased to a
record 64 percent from 58.4 percent, according to data from
research firm Analysys International. Uncertainty over whether
Google would be forced out of the world’s largest Internet
market prompted some advertisers to switch to Beijing-based
Baidu.  
 First Global said it expects Baidu to generate revenue of
$1 billion and earnings per share of $1.11 in 2010, with revenue
of $1.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.71 in 2011.  
 ThinkEquity LLC analyst  Aaron Kessler  maintained a “buy”
rating for Baidu today, without indicating a target price.
