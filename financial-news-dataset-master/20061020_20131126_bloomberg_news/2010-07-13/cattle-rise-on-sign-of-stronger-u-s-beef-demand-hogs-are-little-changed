             Cattle futures rose to an eight-week
high on signs that U.S. beef demand is growing. Hog prices
slipped for the third straight session.  
 Spot-market cattle sold for 93 cents a pound yesterday, up
1 cent from the prior week and 10 cents from a year earlier,
 government data show . Meatpackers shipped 43 million pounds of
 wholesale beef  in the week that ended yesterday, up 44 percent
from 29 million pounds the week before, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  
 “Our demand has been good, and we kind of turned the
corner last week,” said  Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS
Futures Inc. in Oklahoma City. “Packers had to buy cattle on
our terms, and most people think the cash market is only going
to get better.”  
 Cattle futures for October delivery advanced 0.875 cent, or
1 percent, to 92.275 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the highest price since May 14. Feeder-cattle futures
for August settlement rose 0.95 cent, or 0.8 percent, to
$1.13625 a pound.  
 Hog futures for October settlement declined 0.15 cent, or
0.2 percent, to 74.225 cents a pound in Chicago. The price has
climbed 26 percent in the past year after farmers reduced the
breeding herd to the smallest on record to cut costs.
