             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts declined to the lowest level in more than
three weeks after a report showed retail sales rose less than
forecast in May, giving policy makers less reason to raise
interest rates.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 11.26 percent, the lowest since June 16. The decline
was the biggest since June 4.  
 “There’s been ongoing evidence that domestic demand in
Brazil has been moderating from the torrid pace of the first
quarter,” said  Nick Chamie , global head of emerging markets
research at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. “The rates market
is taking some solace in that, and it’s causing the rates to
drift lower in recent weeks.”  
 Retail Sales climbed 10.2 percent in May from a year ago,
and 1.4 percent from the previous month, the national statistics
agency said today on its website. Economists had forecast an
annual increase of 10.7 percent, and a monthly gain of 1.8
percent, according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  
 The central bank will raise the benchmark Selic rate to 11
percent at its July 20-21 meeting, and to 12 percent by year
end, according to a July 9 central bank survey of about 100
economists. The bank raised interest rates twice this year to
10.25 percent from a record low 8.75 percent in March in a bid
to prevent the economy from overheating.  
 The real rose 0.2 percent to 1.7570 per dollar today, from
1.7607 yesterday. Earlier it touched 1.7496, the strongest on an
intraday basis since May 4.
