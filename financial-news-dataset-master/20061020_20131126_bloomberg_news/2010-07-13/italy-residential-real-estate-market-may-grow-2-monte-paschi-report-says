             Italy’s residential real estate 
market may grow as much as 2 percent this year, after a 4.2 
percent jump in sales in the first quarter, Banca Monte dei 
Paschi di Siena SpA said in a research note published on its 
website today.  
  Residential prices may be unchanged or decline as much as 2 
percent in 2010, according to the research. The Italian 
residential real estate market “has reached a bottom,” Monte 
Paschi said in the research.
