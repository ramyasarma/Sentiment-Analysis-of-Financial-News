             Playboy Enterprises Inc.  founder
 Hugh Hefner , facing a potential takeover battle for the
publisher against the owner of Penthouse magazine, said his
offer for the company is in shareholders’ best interest.  
 “I am excited about the prospect of Playboy returning to
private ownership which will reinvigorate the company and create
a lasting legacy for the Playboy brand,” Hefner, 84, said today
in a statement.  
 Penthouse’s owner  FriendFinder Networks Inc.  said it will
probably submit a bid today, following Hefner’s $123 million
offer. Playboy said yesterday that Hefner wants to take the
company private, and offered to purchase the shares he doesn’t
already own in Playboy, which includes the namesake men’s
magazine, merchandise, and television and video content.  
 Hefner plans to offer $5.50 apiece in cash for the Class A
and Class B shares. Hefner is partnering with Rizvi Traverse
Management LLC for the transaction. The offer, at a premium of
more than 30 percent, values Chicago-based Playboy at about
$185 million.  
 “I believe my proposal, which was delivered to the Playboy
Board on July 8, 2010, is in the best interest of the Company
and its minority shareholders and I look forward to continuing
discussions with the Board,” Hefner said in today’s statement.  
 Playboy B shares fell 18 cents to $5.37 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite  trading  after jumping 41 percent
yesterday. The A shares declined 12 cents to $5.42 after
climbing 36 percent yesterday.
