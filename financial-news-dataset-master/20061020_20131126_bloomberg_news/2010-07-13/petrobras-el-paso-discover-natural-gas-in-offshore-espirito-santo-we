             Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, and El Paso Corp. found evidence
of gas in an offshore well in Brazil’s Espirito Santo basin, the
Brazilian petroleum regulator said.  
 The discovery was made at the 1BRSA819AESS well in the BM-
ES-5 block at a water depth of 701 meters (2,300 feet), the
National Petroleum Agency said on its website. Rio de Janeiro-
based Petrobras is the operator and owns a 65 percent stake,
while El Paso holds 35 percent. The companies haven’t determined
if the find can be developed commercially.  
 Petrobras also found more evidence of oil in an onshore
well in Brazil’s Sao Mateus Leste field, according to the
website. That discovery was made at the 3BRSA845ES well in the
Espirito Santo basin. The Sao Mateus Leste field was declared a
commercial find in April 2010.
