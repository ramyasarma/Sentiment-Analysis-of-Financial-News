             The following companies may have
unusual price changes in  Asian trading , excluding Japan. Stock
symbols are in parentheses, and share prices are from the
previous close, unless noted otherwise.  
 Baoshan Iron & Steel Co.  (600019 CH): China’s biggest
publicly traded steelmaker cut prices for a second month amid
weakening demand from makers of automobiles and appliances.
Prices of low-carbon hot-rolled and some cold-rolled products
were slashed by 300 yuan ($44) a metric ton, the Shanghai-based
mill said on its trading website Bsteel.com. Baoshan dropped 2.8
percent to 5.98 yuan.  
 Bandar Raya Development Bhd.  (BRD MK): Bandar Raya, a
Malaysian developer, said it signed an agreement with Multi-
Purpose Holdings Bhd. to jointly develop land totaling 670 acres
in the Penang, Rawang and Gombak districts of Malaysia. Bandar
Raya’s business strategy is to enlarge its development land bank
via joint ventures to improve profitability and shareholder
value, it said in an exchange filing. Bandar Raya added 0.6
percent to 1.75 ringgit.  
 Malaysian Mosaics Bhd.  (MMO MK): The Malaysian maker of
ceramic tiles said its biggest shareholder proposed a capital
repayment of 2.30 ringgit a share to minority investors as part
of a plan to take the company private. The company will be de-
listed once the capital repayment to shareholders is completed,
it said in a statement to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. The
stock will resume trading today. It gained 5 percent to 1.9
ringgit on July 9.  
 Posco  (005490 KS): Asia’s third-largest steelmaker said
second-quarter profit almost tripled from a year earlier to 1.2
trillion won ($992 million). That fell short of the 1.46
trillion won average of 22 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales reached 7.93 trillion won. The shares fell 0.2
percent to 500,000 won.
