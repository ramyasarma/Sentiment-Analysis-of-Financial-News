             Britain’s customer-owned mortgage
lenders may be forced to continue to curtail lending because of
a scarcity of wholesale funding and increased competition for
deposits, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  
 “As wholesale funding markets are still virtually closed
or very expensive for smaller lenders, interest margins continue
to be squeezed,” Moody’s said in a report, “Outlook for U.K.
Mortgage Lenders,” published today. “Funding constraints will
be a key challenge.”  
 Building societies, customer-owned lenders designed to
provide home loans, shrank lending in each of the last 17
months, according to data from the  Building Societies’
Association . J.C. Flowers & Co., the U.S. leveraged buyout firm,
is seeking to acquire building societies in need of capital with
the formation of a joint company with Kent Reliance Building
Society, two people with knowledge of the situation said
on July 12.  
 The repayment of government-assistance programs, the Credit
Guarantee Scheme and the Special Liquidity Scheme over the next
two to three years will make the competition for funding through
customer deposits “even tougher,” said Moody’s.  
 Residential mortgage arrears will also worsen in 2010
because of rising unemployment and mortgage lenders will be
“challenged” to improve profitability, said Moody’s. Such
pressure on profits will bring further consolidation in the
industry, Moody’s said.
