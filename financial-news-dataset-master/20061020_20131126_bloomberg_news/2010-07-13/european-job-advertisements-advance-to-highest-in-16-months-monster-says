             European job advertisements on the
Internet rose last month to the highest in 16 months, with
Germany notching the biggest gains, said  Monster Worldwide Inc.   
 The Monster Employment Index for Europe climbed two points
to 114, New York-based Monster said in a statement today. Since
June last year, the index has increased 12 points, said the
operator of the world’s biggest online job-search website.  
 “The slight improvement in June is yet another encouraging
sign for current job seekers,”  Andrea Bertone , head of Monster
Europe, said in the report. “In addition, the annual growth
rate increased in June, suggesting that we are on the path to
gradual recovery.”  
 Germany’s five-point monthly increase was the biggest while
France, Sweden and Belgium were the only countries to record
monthly declines. Among industries, education as well as
hospitality and tourism had the largest gains, the study showed.  
 Monster’s employment index is based on job-search websites
from all European Union members, including Monster Worldwide’s
website.
