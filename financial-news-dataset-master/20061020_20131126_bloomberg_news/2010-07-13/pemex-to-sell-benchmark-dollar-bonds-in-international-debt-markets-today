             Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned
oil company, sold $2 billion of bonds in overseas markets after
its benchmark yields fell to the lowest level in almost six
months.  
 The Mexico-City based company sold 10.5-year securities to
yield 250 basis points above U.S. Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point equals 0.01 percentage
point. Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC
Holdings Plc arranged the sale, said a person familiar with the
offering who declined to be identified because he’s not allowed
to speak publicly.  
 Pemex is tapping the market after the yield on its 6
percent bond maturing in 2020 fell to 5.22 percent yesterday,
the lowest level since the company issued the notes in January,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Latin America’s largest
oil company sold debt abroad after the Mexican government issued
850 million euros ($1.1 billion) of bonds last week.  
 “When the government issues bonds, Pemex follows to take
advantage of the window that opened,” says  Eduardo Suarez , a
Latin American debt strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
Toronto. “Yields around the world are low and this is
consistent with Pemex’s plans to fund themselves.”  
 Pemex is seeking to finance at least half of its $19
billion capital budget in local and international debt markets
this year as the company attempts to slow a decline in output.  
 Eduardo Marin, a Pemex spokesman in Mexico City, didn’t
return a phone call seeking comment.
