             Applied Materials Inc.  said demand
for semiconductor and solar-panel manufacturing equipment in
Europe is growing rapidly, a sign the region’s debt crisis isn’t
crimping spending.  
 The use of panels on rooftops is growing at an
“unprecedented rate,” and China is also driving demand in the
market for equipment, Chief Executive Officer  Mike Splinter  said
today at the Semicon West show in San Francisco.  
 Applied Materials, the world’s biggest maker of chip
equipment, has tried to lessen its dependence on that market by
expanding into solar-panel machinery. The division that includes
the solar business accounted for 7.2 percent of revenue last
quarter. The company’s  earnings  act as a bellwether for the chip
market because semiconductor companies order machinery in
anticipation of increased demand.  
 “This is the first time since 2007 we can actually have a
smile on our face at Semicon West,” Splinter said.  
 In May, the Santa Clara, California-based company predicted
sales will grow more than 60 percent this year, up from an
earlier  forecast  of 50 percent. The company had projected profit
in the current period of 22 cents to 26 cents a share, excluding
certain items. That compares with the 25-cent average of
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales will rise as
much as 5 percent from the second quarter’s $2.3 billion, it
said.  
 Applied Materials rose 21 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $12.52
at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The
shares have dropped 10 percent this year.
