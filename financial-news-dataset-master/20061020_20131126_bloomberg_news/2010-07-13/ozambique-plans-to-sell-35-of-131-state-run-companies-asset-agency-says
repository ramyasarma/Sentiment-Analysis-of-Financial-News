             Mozambique plans to sell 35 of the
country’s 131 state-owned companies, the chairman of the
nation’s state asset management agency said.  
 Of the state-owned entities, 41 percent were in full
operation while a further 32 percent were operating “with
difficulties,” Instituto de Gestao das Participacoes do Estado
Chairman Hipolito Hamela told reporters in the capital, Maputo,
last night. The agency aims to make the companies profitable and
wants to reduce the number of state-owned enterprises to 46, he
said.
