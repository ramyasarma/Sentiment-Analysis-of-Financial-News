             U.K. stocks  declined, with the
benchmark FTSE 100 Index falling for the first time in seven
days, as a retreat by ICAP Plc and Burberry Group Plc offset a
boost in Intel Corp.’s profit forecast.  
 ICAP, the biggest broker of transactions between banks,
fell 4.6 percent as Chief Executive Officer  Michael Spencer  said
activity slowed in June. Burberry, the U.K.’s largest luxury
retailer, fell 3 percent after Deutsche Bank AG downgraded the
shares. ARM Holdings Plc rallied 3.1 percent after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. raised its price estimate on the shares by 35 percent
and Intel sales beat analysts’ forecasts.  
 The  FTSE 100  lost 0.3 percent to 5,253.52. The gauge
remains 9.8 percent below this year’s high on April 15 amid
concern that growth will be curbed by austerity measures from
European governments cutting their budget deficits and as
economic reports in the U.S. and China disappointed investors.
The  FTSE All-Share Index  fell 0.4 percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ
Index  retreated 0.1 percent today.  
 “We remain in the camp that believes we’re in a slowdown,
not a meltdown,” said Liz-Ann Sonders, the chief investment
strategist at Charles Schwab Corp., which oversees $1.4 trillion
in client assets from San Francisco. “We’ve entered a soft
patch for the economy.”  
 Activity Slowed  
 ICAP’s Spencer said that activity slowed in June “as our
customers’ and end investors’ risk appetites reduced.” Numis
Securities downgraded its  recommendation  on the shares to
“hold” from “add,” saying it doesn’t expect to change its
full-year forecast and that the shares are trading at “fair
value.” The shares fell 4.6 percent to 416.1 pence.  
 Burberry fell 3 percent to 794 pence after Deutsche Bank
downgraded the stock to “hold” from “buy.”  
 ITV Plc  retreated 3.9 percent to 52.4 pence after BofA-
Merrill Lynch Global Research lowered its recommendation for the
U.K.’s biggest commercial broadcaster, saying the shares are
“too expensive.” Analysts downgraded the stock to
“underperform” from “neutral” and cut their price estimate
16 percent to 47 pence.  
 BP Plc fell 2.3 percent to 401 pence as the company delayed
testing of a new cap placed over its leaking Gulf of Mexico oil
well.  
 Main Beneficiary  
 ARM  climbed 3.1 percent to 318.5 pence. Goldman Sachs
increased its price estimate 35 percent to 350 pence saying the
company is a main beneficiary of the tablet computer industry,
according to a report today.  
 The shares were also boosted after Intel, whose processors
run more than 80 percent of the world’s personal computers,
reported second-quarter sales of $10.8 billion, topping the
average analyst estimate of $10.3 billion.  
 Intel is among 23 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index in the U.S. that began reporting quarterly results this
week. Earnings are projected to have climbed 34 percent in the
second quarter and by the same amount in 2010, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Ashmore Group Plc  advanced 3.9 percent to 273.9 pence after
the money manager that focuses on emerging markets reported a 7
percent increase in assets under management to $35.3 billion by
June 30 from $33 billion on March 31.  
 London Stock Exchange Plc  rose 3.6 percent to 626.5 pence.
Europe’s biggest exchange by value of listed stocks said first-
quarter revenue rose as the bourse made more money from
technology.  
 ASOS Plc  climbed 5.9 percent to 949.5 pence. The online
clothing retailer said first-quarter sales rose 48 percent to
65.8 million pounds ($100 million).
