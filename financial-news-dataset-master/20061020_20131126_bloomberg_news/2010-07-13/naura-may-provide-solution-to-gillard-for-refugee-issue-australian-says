             The Pacific nation of Nauru is close
to signing the UN Convention on Refugees, paving the way for the
reopening of an asylum-seeker processing facility closed by the
Labor government, the Australian newspaper said.  
 The infrastructure for the center is still in place and
Nauru’s government is happy to look at the UN convention,
Nauruan President Marcus Stephen said yesterday, according to
the newspaper.  
 Ratification of the convention would satisfy Australian
Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s key objection to reopening the
processing facility, the Australian said.
