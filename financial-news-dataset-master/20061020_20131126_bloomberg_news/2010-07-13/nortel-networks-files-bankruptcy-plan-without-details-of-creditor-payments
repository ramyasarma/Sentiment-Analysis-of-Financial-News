             Nortel Networks Inc. , once part of
North America’s biggest maker of telecommunications equipment,
filed its plan to repay creditors without disclosing how much
they will get.  
 The plan, filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Wilmington, Delaware, doesn’t provide details about how the
company will divide the proceeds from selling its assets.  
 Nortel, based in Toronto, filed for bankruptcy last year
along with its parent, Nortel Networks Corp. The company has
since raised about $2.8 billion from selling assets.  
 Nortel didn’t file a disclosure statement, a summary of the
plan written to help creditors decide whether to support it. The
parent hasn’t yet filed a plan on how it will end its
bankruptcy.  
 The company has said in court papers that it hasn’t decided
what to do with its patent portfolio, which could sell for as
much as $1.1 billion at an auction, analysts say.  
 Those patents could be liquated along with the rest of the
assets, or put into a new licensing company, Nortel said in
court papers.  
 The case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-10138, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
