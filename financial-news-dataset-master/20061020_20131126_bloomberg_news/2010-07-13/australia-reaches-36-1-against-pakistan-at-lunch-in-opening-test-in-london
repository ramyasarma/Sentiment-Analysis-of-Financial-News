             Australia reached 36-1 at lunch on
the first day of the opening cricket Test against Pakistan at
Lord’s in London.  
 Simon Katich has 11 runs and captain Ricky Ponting is on
14. Shane Watson was bowled by Mohammad Aamer after making four
runs.  
 Pakistan won the toss and put Australia in to bat after
rain delayed the start, restricting the morning’s action to 13
overs.  
 It’s the first neutral Test at the “home of cricket”
since 1912 and is being held there because of security concerns
over staging matches in Pakistan. The two-match series counts as
a “home” event for Pakistan.  
 Pakistan: Salman Butt, Imran Farhat, Azhar Ali, Umar Amin, Umar
Akmal, Shahid Afridi (captain), Kamran Akmal, Mohammad Aamer,
Umar Gul, Mohammad Asif, Danish Kaneria.  
 Australia: Shane Watson, Simon Katich, Ricky Ponting (captain),
Michael Clarke, Michael Hussey, Marcus North, Tim Paine, Steven
Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Ben Hilfenhaus, Doug Bollinger.
