             National Australia Bank Ltd. plans
to issue as much as 300 million pounds of capital at its
Clydesdale Bank division in the U.K. to bolster reserves.  
 The Tier 1 capital raising is a “business-as-usual”
activity, Melbourne-based National Australia Bank, Australia’s
largest business lender, said in an e-mailed statement today.
The capital issue hasn’t been completed yet, the bank said.
