             Target Corp., the second-largest
U.S. discount retailer, sold $1 billion of 10-year debt in its
first bond offering since January 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The 3.875 percent notes yield 3.91 percent, or 80 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the data show.
