             Yuan forwards dropped for the first
time in four days on speculation global funds will seek refuge
in the dollar as Europe’s debt crisis deters risk-taking and
lending curbs damp spending in China.  
 Currencies weakened across Asia’s developing economies, led
by a 0.9 percent slide in South Korea’s won, on concern China’s
economic growth will moderate. Property prices snapped a 15-
month run of gains in June and the Ministry of Housing and
Urban-Rural Development today reiterated that it will
“strictly” enforce rules introduced to prevent speculative
real estate investment.  
 “There’s risk apprehension and focus in Europe over
Greece’s going to the market again,” said  Vishnu Varathan , an
economist at Forecast Pte Ltd. in Singapore. “The appetite for
risk really is not that good” also because possible policy
tightening in China is fueling concern about “where the global
economy is headed.”  
 The 12-month non-deliverable forward slid 0.12 percent to
6.6668 per dollar as of 5 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting bets the
currency will gain 1.6 percent from the spot rate of 6.7740,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 China’s economy may have grown 10.5 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, compared with an expansion of 11.9
percent in the first three months of 2010, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before
the data on July 15.  
 Europe Risk  
 Spain, Portugal and Ireland face a 20 percent risk of
having to restructure their public debt while the likelihood is
40 percent for Greece and 10 percent for Italy, Robert Mundell,
a Nobel laureate, said in an interview with Bloomberg yesterday.
Slovakia Prime Minister Iveta Radicova said yesterday she
doesn’t support a rescue package put together by the European
Union for regional governments at risk of default.  
 China’s central bank fixed the yuan at 6.7802 per dollar,
the weakest level in eight days. The currency is allowed to
trade 0.5 percent either side of that rate.  
 Industrial production may have increased 15.1 percent in
June from the same month last year, compared with 16.5 percent
in May, according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of the data on
July 15. Retail sales likely rose 18.8 percent from 18.7 percent
in May, while consumer prices may have climbed 3.3 percent
versus 3.1 percent the previous month, separate surveys show.  
 Bonds Gain  
 Government bonds rose for a second day on speculation
economic growth will slow through December and as a drop in
money-market rates signaled investors may have more money to
invest in debt.  
 The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures lending costs
between banks, declined for a fifth day, losing eight basis
points to 1.99 percent, according to the daily fixing rate
published by the National Interbank Funding Center. That was the
lowest level since June 7.  
 The People’s Bank of China has added cash to the money
market for seven consecutive weeks to help ease a shortage of
funds.  
 An easing in liquidity between banks, reflected in sliding
money-market rates, bolstered demand for debt, according to  Shen Junhua , a Shenzhen-based bond analyst at China Jianyin
Investment Securities Co.  
 “What dominates the bond market recently is people’s
worries about a slower recovery before the June data release,”
Shen said. “The central bank has also tried to keep a loose
monetary policy via open-market operations amid such concerns.”  
 The yield on the 3.9 percent government note due in August
2014 fell one basis point to 2.46 percent, and the price of the
security added 0.04 per 100 yuan face amount to 105.56,
according to the funding center. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 The People’s Bank of China sold 35 billion yuan ($5.2
billion) of  one-year bills  today at a yield of 2.0929 percent,
unchanged for the fifth week straight week.
