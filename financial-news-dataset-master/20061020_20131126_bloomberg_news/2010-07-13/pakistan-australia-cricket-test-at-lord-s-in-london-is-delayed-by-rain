             The start of the first cricket Test
between Pakistan and Australia at Lord’s in London has been
delayed by rain. Play is due to start at noon local time.  
 It’s the first neutral Test at the “home of cricket”
since 1912 and is being held there because of security concerns
over staging matches in Pakistan. The two-match series counts as
a “home” event for Pakistan.
