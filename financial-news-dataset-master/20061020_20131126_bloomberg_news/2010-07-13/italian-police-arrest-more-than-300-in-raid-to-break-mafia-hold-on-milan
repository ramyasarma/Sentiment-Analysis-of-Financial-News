             Police arrested more than 300
mobsters accused of trafficking drugs and arms, extortion,
murder and other crimes in a raid aimed at breaking the grip of
the ‘Ndrangheta mafia on Milan, Italy’s financial capital.  
 Among those arrested during the pre-dawn operation was 80-
year-old Domenico Oppedisano, purportedly “boss of bosses” of
the ‘Ndrangheta, which is based mainly in the southern region of
Calabria, Ansa news agency said. Pino Neri, the group’s alleged
head in Milan, was also arrested as police seized money, arms,
drugs and real-estate, according to an e-mailed statement from
Italian police today.  
 “This is one of the most important operations against the
’Ndrangheta in recent years,” Interior Minister  Roberto Maroni 
said in a separate statement.  
 The country’s main crime groups, including the ‘Ndrangheta,
boosted their profit 12 percent to more than 78 billion euros
($98 billion) in 2009, according to a January report by Rome-
based anti-racketeering group SOS Impresa. Estimated revenue by
Italy’s main mob groups rose 4 percent to 135 billion euros last
year, SOS Impresa said. That exceeds the revenue of oil company
 Eni SpA , Italy’s biggest company by market value, and is almost
9 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product.  
 The ‘Ndrangheta (pronounced en-DRANG-eta), traditionally
based in the region that forms the toe of Italy’s boot-shaped
peninsula, is made up of clans called ‘ndrine. Authorities now
consider the group to be Italy’s most dangerous mafia, rivaling
Sicily’s Cosa Nostra, due to rising wealth from its intermediary
role in smuggling South American cocaine to Europe.
