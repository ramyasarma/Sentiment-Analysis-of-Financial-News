             Greece’s debt agency head said
foreign investors were among buyers of 26-week Treasury bills
sold by the government today.  
 “We are happy with the composition of the investor base and
participation,”  Petros Christodoulou , head of the country’s debt
management agency, said in an interview. “Starting from the very
short end of the market, this is a thumbs up for the fiscal
policy that has been implemented.’’  
 Greece sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.1 billion) of the
securities at a yield of 4.65 percent, the debt agency said.
