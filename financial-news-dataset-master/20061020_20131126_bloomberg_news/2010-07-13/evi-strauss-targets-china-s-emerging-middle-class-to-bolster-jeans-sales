             Levi Strauss & Co. will start
selling less expensive jeans in China later this year to tap
into the country’s increasing middle class, Chief Financial
Officer  Blake Jorgensen  said.  
 “The emerging middle class is the real opportunity,”
Jorgensen, 50, said yesterday in a telephone interview from San
Francisco, where Levi is based. The company wants to pursue
“that aspirational consumer that’s really the future growth
over the next 20 to 50 years.”  
 Levi sells jeans for more than $100 a pair in China, where
it competes for affluent consumers with VF Corp.’s Lee and
Wrangler brands and Phillips-Van Heusen Corp.’s Calvin Klein
line, Jorgensen said. He didn’t specify the price range of the
new jeans.  
 Closely held Levi plans to start selling the jeans in the
fourth quarter that starts in September, Chief Executive Officer
 John Anderson  said yesterday by phone. He wouldn’t disclose
Levi’s sales in China or additional details.  
 Levi plans to expand in other emerging markets, including
India, according to Jorgensen.  
 Levi reported yesterday its net loss widened to $14.4
million in the three months that ended May 30, from $4.13
million a year earlier, because of debt refinancing costs and a
tax write-down. Revenue advanced 8 percent in the second quarter
to $976.5 million.
