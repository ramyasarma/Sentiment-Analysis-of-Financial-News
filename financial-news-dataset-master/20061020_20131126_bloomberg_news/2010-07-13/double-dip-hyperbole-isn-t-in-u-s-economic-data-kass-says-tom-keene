             Investors should be bullish on U.S.
equities because data suggests there’s some “hyperbole”
surrounding calls for the economy to fall back into recession,
said  Doug Kass , president of Seabreeze Partners Management Inc.  
 Leading indicators, including the Conference Board’s
Employment Trends Index and the Institute for Supply
Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses, signal the
economy will expand, Kass said today in a radio interview with
 Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Surveillance.  
 “There was a lot of hyperbole, especially as it related to
the possibility of a double dip,” Kass said. “The empirical
data, for example, argued in favor of a moderating expansion.”  
 That contrasts with the view of  Dennis Gartman,  an
economist and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman
Letter, who forecast that equities would decline from the highs
reached in April. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped as low
as 1,022.58 on July 2, after reaching a high for the year of
1,217.28 on April 23. The  benchmark index  has rebounded since
then and strengthened to 1,093.65 today.  
 “What I look at oft-times is how the market is trading
technically as opposed to how it’s trading relative to its
economic data,” Gartman said during the same radio interview
today. “That is what I find discouraging.”  
 The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index rose in June
for an 11th consecutive month to 96.7. The measure is up 9.8
percent from a year ago. The ISM index, which covers about 90
percent of the economy,  fell  to 53.8 in June from 55.4 the prior
month. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  
 ‘Not Remotely Consistent’  
 Kass, who oversees about $200 million for the Palm Beach,
Florida-based hedge fund, said the ISM number is “absolutely in
line with the sixth-month average.”  
 “That combined reading of 54 is not remotely consistent
with a double dip,” Kass said. “It’s not even consistent with
real GDP under plus 2 percent.”  
 The economy will expand by 3.10 percent in 2010 and 2.80
percent in 2011, according to the median of 76 projections in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 In an April 2009 interview, Kass said a double dip
recession in late 2009 to early 2010 was “very probable.”
