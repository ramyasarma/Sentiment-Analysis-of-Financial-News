             Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  plans to
export 10,000 additional 3-Series vehicles from its Munich plant
to China this year to meet growing demand, Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing BMW personnel chief  Harald Krueger .  
 BMW is exporting the vehicles to China, which are subject
to an import tax of 25 percent, because production capacity in
the country can’t keep up with demand, the newspaper said.  
 The German carmaker also plans to seek an agreement on
longer working hours with the works council in Germany, FTD
said.
