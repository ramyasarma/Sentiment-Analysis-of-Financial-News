             In  George Steinbrenner ’s 37-year
tenure as owner, the value of the New York Yankees increased by
about 15,900 percent.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY shows the estimated value of the Major
League Baseball franchise increased to about $1.6 billion from
about $10 million when Steinbrenner, who died today at 80,
bought the team in 1973, according to analysis by Forbes
magazine.  
 That change shows Steinbrenner’s success at using
baseball’s free-agent market to transform the Yankees into a
title-winning global brand, said  Andrew Zimbalist , an economics
professor at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts.  
 “He was a trailblazer,” Zimbalist said. “He came along
just before the era of free agency and he realized that he was
in the entertainment capital of the world and there was a lot of
commercialization he could do.”  
 The Yankees have won a record 27 World Series
championships, including seven under Steinbrenner, most recently
in 2009.
