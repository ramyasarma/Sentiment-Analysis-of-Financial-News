             Russia’s public-health chief urged
companies to adopt a siesta regime for workers struggling to
cope with a record heat wave.  
 “Employers should consider moving shifts to earlier and
later hours and allowing extended breaks during the peak of the
heat,”  Gennady Onishchenko  said on Rossiya 24 state television.  
 Temperatures have broken July records in dozens of cities
in European Russia, including Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.
Moscow on July 15-16 may break the all-time record of 36.8
degrees Celsius (98.2 Farenheit) set in August 1920, Tatiana
Pozdnyakova, chief specialist at the Moscow Meteorological
Service, said by phone.  
 The government has declared a state of emergency in 16
grain-producing regions as the worst drought in at least a
decade damages crops and livelihoods. Russia, which is vying
with Canada to rank as the largest wheat exporter after the
U.S., expects this year’s grain harvest to decline at least 12
percent to 85 million metric tons.  
 Temperatures in central Russia will exceed the norm by more
than 7 degrees Celsius this week, reaching as high as 38 degrees
Celsius in some areas, according to the Meteorological Service’s
 website .
