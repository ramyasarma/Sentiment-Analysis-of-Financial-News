             Sugar output in Brazil’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, will rise less than
expected this year as dry weather harms crops, industry group
Unica said.  
 Sao Paulo state, where about 60 percent of Brazil’s sugar
is produced, received 14 millimeters of rain (half an inch) in
June, compared with an average 40 millimeters for the month in
the previous 15 years,  Antonio de Padua , Unica’s technical
director, said. The southeastern state got 21 millimeters of
rain in May, compared with a 15-year average of 50 millimeters,
he said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo yesterday.  
 Brazil’s Center South, which includes Sao Paulo and five
other states, produces 90 percent of Brazil’s sweetener and
ethanol made from sugar cane. The region is forecast to harvest
595.9 million metric tons of cane this year, up 10 percent from
2009, Unica said March 31. Sugar output was estimated at 34.1
million tons, up from 28.6 million. Padua declined to give a new
estimate.  
 Dryness may boost the concentration of sucrose, the
substance that is processed into ethanol and sugar, partly
offsetting the smaller-than-expected harvest, Padua said. Crops
may yield as much as 140 kilograms (309 pounds) of sucrose per
ton of cane, up from a previous forecast of 138.6 kilograms per
ton, he said.  
 “Sucrose content is going to be higher, which will
partially compensate for a smaller sugar-cane crop,” Padua
said.  
 The Center South has harvested around 40 percent of the
sugar-cane crop so far this year, he said. He didn’t say when
Unica will release its next estimate on sugar and ethanol
output.
