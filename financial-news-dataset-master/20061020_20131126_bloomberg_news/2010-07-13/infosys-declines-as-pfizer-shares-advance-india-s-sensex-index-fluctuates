             India’s stocks rose to the highest
level in more than two years on expectations that earnings of
local companies will remain strong.  
 Hindalco Industries Ltd. , the nation’s biggest aluminum
producer, gained 1.2 after  Alcoa Inc. , the largest U.S. maker of
the metal, reported profit that beat analysts’ estimates,
signaling economic recovery and higher demand for the metal.
 Housing Development Finance Corp. , a mortgage lender, rose 2
percent before tomorrow’s earnings report. Profit climbed 31
percent, according to a survey of nine analysts by Bloomberg.  
 “Metal, banking and infrastructure stocks are going to
post good results,” said  Anu Jain , vice president at Mumbai-
based IIFL Private Wealth Management Ltd., which advises clients
on investment strategies for assets worth $1.7 billion. “We are
bullish on the markets. We are buying at every dip. The outlook
for growth and earnings remains strong.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 48.70, or 0.3 percent, to 17,985.90, its highest since
Feb. 19, 2008. The measure climbed for a fourth day after the
International Monetary Fund said India’s economy may expand this
year at the fastest pace since 2007.  
 The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.3 percent to 5,400.65. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.4 percent
to 2,287.88.  
 Hindalco added 1.2 percent to 151.3 rupees. Aluminum for
delivery in three months increased 39 percent on average in the
second quarter from a year earlier on the London Metal Exchange.
Alcoa forecast yesterday demand will rise, fanning optimism
about corporate earnings.  
 Steel Makers  
 Tata Steel Ltd. , the biggest producer of the alloy,
increased 2.2 percent to 508.8 rupees.  JSW Steel Ltd. , India’s
third-largest producer, added 1.7 percent to 1,101.15 rupees.  
 Housing Development rose 2 percent to 3,064.3 rupees.  State
Bank of India Ltd. , the nation’s biggest lender, advanced 1.2
percent to 2,429.1 rupees.  HDFC Bank Ltd.,  the third-biggest
lender, increased 1.1 percent to 2,072.55 rupees.  
 Reliance Industries Ltd. , the nation’s most valuable
company, gained 1.7 percent to 1,074.3 rupees after CNBC-TV18
reported it’s in talks to buy its third shale gas asset in North
America, without saying where it got the information.  Manoj Warrier , a spokesman for Reliance Industries, didn’t immediately
comment on the report when contacted by telephone.  
 “We have a buy call on Reliance; we feel probably it’s
poised more towards the 1,140 rupees to 1,200 rupees zone in the
next six to eight months,” said IIFL’s Jain.  
 Cutting Prices  
 Infosys Technologies Ltd. , the second-largest software
services provider, dropped 3.4 percent to 2,796.75 rupees, its
biggest decline since Sept. 24. Quarterly  net income  fell 2.6
percent to 14.9 billion rupees ($318.5 million) in the three
months through June from a year earlier. The average of 25
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of 15.6
billion rupees.  
 Infosys Chief Executive Officer  S. Gopalakrishnan  cut
prices to retain and win  business  from customers in the U.S. and
Europe, where it gets about 90 percent of its sales. The euro’s
6.3 percent decline against the rupee in three months reduced
the value of European sales when converted to the local currency.  
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. , the largest software-
services provider, fell 2.2 percent to 774.65 rupees.  Wipro Ltd. ,
the third-biggest software exporter, lost 1.4 percent to 403.95
rupees.  
 Pfizer Ltd., a unit of the world’s biggest drugmaker,
climbed for the first day in four after quarterly net income
rose. The shares advanced 2 percent to 1,223.85 rupees. Second-
quarter net income rose 11 percent from a year earlier to 346.9
million rupees, according to its stock market filing today.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  34.7 billion rupees  of Indian
equities on July 9, increasing total investments in the stocks
this year to 362.3 billion rupees, according to the nation’s
market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:

its steepest drop in almost two months. The telecom company was
downgraded to “sell” from “buy” by  Suresh Mahadevan , an
