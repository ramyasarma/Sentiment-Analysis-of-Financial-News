             Citigroup Inc.  will transfer
management of a group of in-house private-equity funds to
StepStone Group LLC and sell interests in its funds to Lexington
Partners Inc. as part of a plan to shrink the bank’s assets.  
 StepStone , based in La Jolla, California, will take over
management of $4 billion in funds-of-funds and buyout co-
investments previously run by the Citi Private Equity unit, the
New York-based bank said today in a statement. New York-based
Lexington will buy Citigroup’s interests in the funds, according
to the statement. Terms of the deal, scheduled to close in the
fourth quarter, weren’t disclosed.  
 Citi Private Equity was formed in 2000 and had about
$10 billion under management as of January including the firm’s
own investments. The unit was among more than  two dozen
businesses  that Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit , 53,
tagged for sale or shutdown in early 2009.  
 “Citi will continue to pursue opportunities to divest non-
core assets,” the bank said in the statement. The deal will
reduce the size of Citigroup’s  balance sheet  by $1.1 billion. As
of March 31, the bank had $2 trillion of assets.  
 A “significant number” of Citi Private Equity’s employees
are expected to join StepStone and Lexington, with some
remaining at Citigroup, according to the statement.  
 Citigroup will retain management of employee investment
funds that were managed by Citi Private Equity, according to the
statement. The bank also will retain “certain proprietary
interests” in the employee funds.
