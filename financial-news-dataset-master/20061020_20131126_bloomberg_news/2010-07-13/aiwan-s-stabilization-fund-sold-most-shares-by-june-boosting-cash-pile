             Taiwan’s National Stabilization Fund
sold “most of its shares” from March to June and ended the
first half of 2010 with cash of NT$29.73 billion ($926 million),
the  Government Information Office  said.  
 The fund had total assets of NT$47.8 billion at the end of
June, the office said in an e-mailed statement today, without
giving a reason for the share sales. The government created the
NT$500 billion fund in March 2000 to support the stock market.  
 Taiwan’s  Taiex Index  has retreated 7.1 percent  this year ,
paring a 78 percent rally in 2009 that was driven by optimism
closer ties with China will boost earnings. Under a trade
agreement signed on June 29, China will cut duties on fuel oil,
copper foil and about 500 other  Taiwanese  goods, underscoring
the success of Taiwan President  Ma Ying-jeou ’s two-year drive
for rapprochement between the civil war foes.  
 “We are ready to enter the market any time to buy or sell
shares,” Finance Minister  Lee Sush-der  told reporters in Taipei
today. “The purpose of the stabilization fund is to maintain
stability in the stock market.”  
 Vice Premier  Sean Chen  declined to say at the briefing how
much money the stabilization fund currently has invested in
stocks or when the fund will sell further holdings.  
 The fund authorized an investment team to decide on the
selling and buying of shares, Vice Finance Minister  Tseng Ming- chung  said in January. Previously, the fund’s steering committee
decided on share purchases or sales at quarterly meetings.
