             Nissan Motor Co. , Japan’s third-
largest carmaker, may halt production at plants in Tennessee and
Mexico because of delays in receiving engine parts from Hitachi
Ltd., the company said.  
 A decision on whether to halt output in North America
hasn’t been made yet,  Toshiyuki Shiga , Nissan’s chief operating
officer, told reporters today in Yokohama, Japan, where the
company is based. The carmaker will stop production at factories
in Japan from July 14 to July 16 because of the parts delay,
cutting output by 15,000 automobiles, Nissan said.  
 Engine control units made by Tokyo-based Hitachi couldn’t
be delivered on time to Nissan because integrated circuits
needed to make them were not available from a supplier, Hitachi
said yesterday. Two other automakers were affected, Hitachi said,
without naming them. Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.,
Japan’s two biggest automakers, said yesterday they weren’t
affected.  
 Nissan  fell  1.4 percent to 646 yen as of the 11 a.m.
trading break in Tokyo.
