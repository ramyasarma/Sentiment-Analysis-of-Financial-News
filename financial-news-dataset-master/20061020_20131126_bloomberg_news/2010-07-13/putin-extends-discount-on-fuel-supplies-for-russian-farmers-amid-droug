             Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin agreed to extend a discount on fuel supplies to farmers,
who are suffering the worst drought in at least a decade.  
 Prices for oil products including diesel and lubricants
were set at December 2009 levels and will be adjusted monthly,
according to the government’s website. The prices will be about
10 percent cheaper than current wholesale rates.  
 The measures have saved farmers about 3.2 billion rubles
($104 million) so far this year, after last year’s 3 billion-
ruble subsidy, the government said.
