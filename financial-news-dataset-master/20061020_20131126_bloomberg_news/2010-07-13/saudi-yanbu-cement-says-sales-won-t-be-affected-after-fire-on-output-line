             Yanbu Cement, Saudi Arabia’s fifth
largest clinker maker by market value, said sales won’t be
impacted by a fire that broke out yesterday in an oil boiler at
the company’s fourth production line.  
 The damaged unit will be replaced in five days, the company
said in a statement on the Saudi bourse website today. The
company has more than 500,000 metric tons of clinker stock, it
said.
