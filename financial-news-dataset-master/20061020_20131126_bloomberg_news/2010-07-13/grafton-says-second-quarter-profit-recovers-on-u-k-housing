             Grafton Group Plc (GN5) , Ireland’s biggest
builders’ merchant, said profit recovered “strongly” in the
second quarter of the year as the U.K. new housing market
strengthened.  
 U.K. sales at stores open at least a year rose 4 percent,
compared with a drop of 2 percent in the first quarter, Dublin-based Grafton said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.
First-half revenue was about 980 million euros ($1.2 billion),
down from 990 million euros in the year-earlier period.  
 The U.K., which accounts for 60 percent of Grafton’s sales,
is recovering from a housing slump that sapped demand for the
company’s brick, tile and plumbing products. The average cost of
a U.K. home was 6.3 percent higher in June than a year earlier,
HBOS Plc’s Halifax unit said last week.  
 “The better sales trend, coupled with substantial cost
savings, is leading to a strong recovery in profits,” Robert Eason, an analyst at  Goodbody Stockbrokers  in Dublin, said in a
research note.  
 Grafton  rose  as much as 9 cents, or 2.9 percent, to 3.15
euros in Dublin, and traded at that level at 8:30 a.m. local
time, raising the company’s market value to 729 million euros.  
 Refinancing of the company’s debt “is progressing
satisfactorily and on schedule,” Grafton said. New arrangements
are likely to take effect in the third quarter.
