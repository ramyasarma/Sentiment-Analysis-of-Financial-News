             The American League All-Stars’
dominance of the mid-season baseball showcase extends to their
paychecks: The AL team makes 45 percent more than the National
League.  
 The 33 AL players originally picked for tonight’s game at
Angels Stadium in Anaheim, California, each make an average of
$2.77 million more than their NL counterparts, according to the
annual data compiled by USA Today. The New York Yankees boost
the AL figure, with six players from the defending World Series
champions making a combined $104.3 million, or 35.2 percent of
the league’s total.  
 The AL has been dominant since interleague play started in
1997, with more wins 10 of the 14 seasons. The AL has won eight
of 13 World Series and 12 of 13 All-Star Games, with the one
exception a tie in 2002.  
 Spending more money on players doesn’t guarantee victory --
the Chicago Cubs have the third-highest payroll this year and
have lost 11 more games than they won -- but it controls 20
percent of a team’s wins, according to research by  Andrew Zimbalist , an economics professor at Smith College who consults
with Major League Baseball.  
 “Payroll and salary are significant factors in determining
team performance, they are not the only factor,” Zimbalist said
in a telephone interview from Smith, which is in Northampton,
Massachusetts.  
 Boosting the AL average are the Yankees, who lead baseball
with a $206.3 million payroll. Yankees third baseman  Alex Rodriguez , at $33 million annually, is the highest-paid member
of the AL team; Philadelphia Phillies first baseman  Ryan Howard ,
30, at $19 million is the highest paid on the NL squad.  
 Eight Yankees  
 The Yankees wound up with eight official All-Stars. New
York left-hander  Andy Pettitte  replaced the injured  Clay Buchholz  of the Boston Red Sox. Outfielder  Nick Swisher  was
added as the final player in fan balloting.  
 Rodriguez, 34, is batting .269 with 14 home runs and 70
runs batted in. Santana is 7-5 with a 2.98 earned run average.
The Tampa Bay Rays’  David Price , 24, ($1.83 million) and
Colorado Rockies  Ubaldo Jimenez , 26, ($1.25 million) were named
the starting pitchers.  
 “A rising tide moves all the boats, right?” said  Dan Duquette , former general manager of the Montreal Expos and
Boston Red Sox, who now runs a sports academy bearing his name
in Massachusetts. “Some of that happens when the free agent
market brings along the salaries of the top players. It also
pulls along everyone else for the ride.”  
 NL Shortage  
 Even without the Yankees, the AL squad makes more. The
average salary then for the AL squad would be $7.1 million,
still higher than the NL’s $6.3 million.  
 “Spending money on your roster doesn’t guarantee that
you’ll have a successful team, but not spending on it tends to
have an impact and perhaps the same thing applies with the All-
Star Game,” said  David Carter , executive director of the Sports
Business Institute at the University of Southern California.
“If you don’t have high-priced players, the chances of you
succeeding are less.”  

 

     The following is a list of 2010 Major League Baseball All-
Stars originally selected and their salaries this season as
