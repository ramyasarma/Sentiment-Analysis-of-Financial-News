             Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. ,
the uranium producer controlled by Rio Tinto Group, said second-
quarter output fell 44 percent after heavy rain and instability
in a pit wall reduced access to high-grade ore. Its shares fell.  
 Uranium oxide production dropped to 829 metric tons, or
1.828 million pounds, in the three months ended June 30, the
Darwin-based company said in a statement today, from 3.266
million pounds a year earlier. Full-year output may fall as much
as 18 percent in 2010, it said.  
 Energy Resources, which operates the Ranger mine 260
kilometers (162 miles) east of Darwin in the Northern Territory,
plans to expand the project as China and India lead the biggest
atomic expansion since the decade after the 1970s oil crisis. An
environmental assessment for a proposed plant to extract uranium
oxide from stored low-grade ore will be submitted to the
government in the second half, it said.  
 “China continues to be a very important customer,” Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Atkinson  said in an interview from
Darwin. The demand outlook for the medium-term “is very
positive, especially because of the Chinese expansion in their
electricity generation industry,” he said. “That’s going to
drive a huge amount of requirement for uranium.”  
 Energy Resources exported its first cargo of uranium to
China in 2008, and a second shipment last year, Atkinson said.
Customers include power utilities in Europe and the U.S.,
according to the Australian company’s  website .  
 Ranger Deeps  
 Energy Resources  slumped  as much as 5 percent to A$14.00 in
Sydney trading, the biggest decline since May 21. The shares
were at A$14.09 at 12:57 p.m., compared with a 0.2 percent drop
in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  
 Full-year output is expected to be between 4,300 tons and
4,700 tons because of reduced access to the high grade ore,
Energy Resources said. The company had previously forecast
production to be about 5,240 tons.  
 The proposed plant to extract uranium oxide from stored
low-grade ore may cost “hundreds of millions” and is expected
to start production in 2013, Atkinson said. Output is forecast
to be between 15,000 tons and 20,000 tons during a five to six
year period, he said.  
 A decision to develop an exploration decline to further
evaluate an underground resource will be made in the third
quarter, Energy Resources said in its production report. Ranger
3 Deeps contains about 34,000 tons of uranium oxide.
