             Australian police have seized more 
than 240 kilograms of cocaine worth some A$84 million in what 
is being described as the fifth-largest such seizure in the 
nation’s history, Sky News reported on its website.  
 The cocaine was found in paving stones moved in shipping 
containers from Mexico, the report said.  
 As part of a police operation, the cocaine was replaced and
the shipment was delivered to a warehouse near Melbourne before
the paving stones supposedly containing the drugs where 
separated from real paving stones, the report said. The 
shipment was then allegedly moved to Sydney where it was 
delivered to a home, Sky News said.  
 Four men have been arrested and charged, the Australian 
Federal Police said in a news release.
