             PSA Peugeot Citroen will begin
offering a new sedan, the 508, that will replace both its 407
and its top-of-the-line 607, La Tribune reported, without saying
where it got the information.  
 The sedan, 4.79 meters (15.7 feet) long, will be on sale
from February 2011, followed by a station wagon version in March
and a hybrid four-wheel-drive model later on, the French daily
said. It’ll be produced in Rennes, France for the European
market, and in Wuhan, China, for launch there in mid-2011,
according to the newspaper.  
 The Rennes factory is capable of producing 34 cars an hour
at maximum capacity, equal to 714 a day on three shifts or close
to 160,000 a year, triple the current production for the C5
model on which the 508 is based, the newspaper said.
