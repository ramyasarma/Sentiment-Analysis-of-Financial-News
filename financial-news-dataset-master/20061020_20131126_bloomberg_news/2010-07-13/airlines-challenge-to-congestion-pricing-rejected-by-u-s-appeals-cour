             A U.S. appeals court rejected an
airline industry challenge to a regulation letting airport
operators charge more at busy times of the day to reduce delays.  
 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
denied the petition by the carriers’ Washington trade group, the
 Air Transport Association , which represents companies including
 Delta Air Lines Inc . and  AMR Corp ., the owner of American
Airlines. The carriers argued the July 2008 regulation by the
Transportation Department was discriminatory and unreasonable.  
 The “creativity” of regulators should be welcomed to
alleviate flight congestion, the appeals court wrote.  
 “It is entirely reasonable to expect an airline, and in
turn its passengers, to pay a premium for the opportunity to
arrive at a peak time,” the court wrote.  
 When the regulation was put in place, then-Secretary of
Transportation  Mary Peters  said it would encourage airlines to
spread out flights to less-busy hours and use bigger planes and
less crowded airports.  
 In its challenge, the airlines also claimed the regulation
wrongfully allowed state and local airport authorities to charge
fees preempted by federal law and provided inadequate guidance
to the airports on how the Department of Transportation would
evaluate the reasonableness of the fees.  
 The Air Transport Association said it is reviewing the
decision.  
 “We remain concerned about the threat of unreasonable and
unjustified airport rates and charges and their potential
adverse impact on the cost of air transportation,” the group
said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The case is Air Transport Association of America Inc. v.
U.S. Department of Transportation, 08-1293, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington).
