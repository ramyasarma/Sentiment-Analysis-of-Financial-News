             President  Vaclav Klaus , the Czech
Republic’s most high-profile critic of the European Union and
the bloc’s common currency, said the euro will survive Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis at an “extreme” cost.  
 “There will be no collapse of the euro,” Klaus said in a
July 10 interview with Bloomberg Television in Siena, Italy.
Continuation of the euro “will be extremely costly, not just in
fiscal transfers,” he said, “but especially in the continuing
slowdown of the European economy, which is the real cost for all
of the people living on the European continent.”  
 Klaus, a fan of  Milton Friedman  and  Margaret Thatcher ,
delayed signing the Lisbon Treaty designed to revamp the EU’s
decision-making system. He became the last EU leader to sign the
document in November, saying he believed the treaty would mean
the Czech Republic “ceases to be a sovereign state.”  
 The more active politicians in Europe are in dealing with
the economic crisis, “the more nervous the markets are”
because they fear over-regulation that would kill “all kinds of
dynamism and entrepreneurship in the economy,” Klaus said.  
 “The less the politicians do, the less the politicians
talk about, the better for the economy,” said Klaus, a 69-year-
old economist who was in Siena for a gathering of business
leaders, economists and public officials hosted by  Robert Mundell , winner of the Nobel prize for economics in 1999.  
 There are signs of an economic recovery and with fiscal
deficits still a problem in Europe, governments should stay away
from new economic-stimulus packages, Klaus said.  
 “The worst is over,” he said. “The deficit will probably
be financed by the joint effort of the European and
international communities. Another issue is whether I am
satisfied with this or not. But as a forecast, I guess that it
will be financed. I wouldn’t suggest another stimulus.”  
 The Czech Republic, which joined the EU in 2004, hasn’t set
a target date for a currency switch, though it must eventually
adopt the euro as part of its accession agreement.
