             Telefonica SA  ruled out extending
beyond July 16 its 7.15 billion-euro ($9 billion) offer for
 Portugal Telecom SGPS SA ’s stake in a venture that controls
Brazil’s largest mobile-phone company.  
 Telefonica’s bid for Portugal Telecom’s stake in Brasilcel
NV, which was approved by 74 percent of the shareholders of the
Lisbon-based company present at a meeting on June 30, was
blocked by the Portuguese government. Since then, the companies
have continued negotiations.  
 “This ends July 16,” Chairman  Cesar Alierta  told
reporters today in Madrid. “Brasilcel is a relationship
between Portugal Telecom and Telefonica and as far as I know
there is no need for anybody else to interfere.”  
 Alierta is putting pressure on the board of Portugal
Telecom and on the country’s government to agree to a sale. The
bid kicked off with a 5.7 billion-euro offer on May 6.
Telefonica, which claimed this first bid was “fair, full and
final,” later raised it two times to win the backing of the
Portuguese company’s investors.  
 Telefonica shares  rose 1.6 percent to 16.42 euros at 3:05
p.m. in Madrid. Portugal Telecom slipped 0.9 percent to 8.26
euros in Lisbon.  
 ‘Unattractive Situation’  
 The two phone companies jointly own Brasilcel, which
controls 60 percent of  Vivo Participacoes SA . Telefonica will
go to a Dutch arbitration court to seek the breakup of
Brasilcel if it can’t reach an agreement this week, Spanish
newspaper ABC reported today, citing people close to the phone
company’s board it didn’t identify.  
 “For all parties this is an increasingly unattractive
situation, with the risk of a protracted legal process likely
to be damaging to everyone involved,”  Robin Bienenstock , an
analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, said today in a report.  
 Portugal Telecom said in a June 10 regulatory filing that
any claims by Telefonica that it could seek an end to the
venture or block dividends from the alliance should be ignored.  
 “No consideration should be given Telefonica’s
suggestions,” the Lisbon-based company said at the time,
citing comments from legal advisers.
