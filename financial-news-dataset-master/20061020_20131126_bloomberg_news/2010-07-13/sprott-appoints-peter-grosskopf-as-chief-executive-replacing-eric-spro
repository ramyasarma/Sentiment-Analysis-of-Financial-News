             Eric Sprott , whose gold and
resource-based hedge funds soared six-fold over nine years, is
stepping down as chief executive officer of  Sprott Inc.  and will
be replaced by  Peter Grosskopf  on Sept. 7.  
 Sprott, 65, becomes chairman of the company, replacing Jack
Lee, and will be chief investment officer of Sprott Asset
Management, the Toronto-based firm said today in a statement.
Grosskopf joins Sprott Inc.’s board and will serve as president
and CEO of Sprott Resource Lending Corp.  
 The Toronto-based money manager’s Sprott Hedge Fund
returned about 496 percent in the nine years to the end of 2009
as bets on gold stocks and oil and gas companies paid off.  
 Sprott founded his current money management firm after
divesting Sprott Securities, now Cormark Securities Inc., to its
employees. Grosskopf is president of Cormark.  
 Sprott Asset Management’s senior portfolio manager  Peter Hodson  will be stepping down from the board, the firm said. Lee
will serve as Sprott Inc.’s lead director, the company said.  
 Sprott Inc. fell 5 cents to C$3.30 at 3:56 p.m. in trading
on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has plunged from its
initial public offering price of C$10 in 2008.
