-- Trade Deficit in U.S. Probably Narrowed as Oil Prices Declined

             The U.S. trade deficit probably
narrowed in May to the lowest level in four months as lower oil
prices restrained imports, economists said before a report
today.  
 The  gap  decreased to $39 billion, the lowest level since
January, from $40.3 billion in April, according to the median
forecast of 71 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Exports
slowed for a second consecutive month, economists said.  
 The fallout from Europe’s debt crisis may limit trade flows
in coming months and slow U.S. growth. The resulting increase in
the value of the dollar makes American-made goods less
competitive and could weigh on overseas sales at companies such
as  Deere & Co. , the world’s largest farm-equipment maker.  
 “Weakness in the euro is likely to put some pressure on
the trade deficit,” said  Guy LeBas , chief fixed-income
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.
“Export orders represent one of the bigger threats to the U.S.
manufacturing sector right now. It seems the U.S. consumers are
certainly not faltering in their demand for goods and services
worldwide, but they’re not growing at a significant pace
either.”  
 The Commerce Department’s trade data is due at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington. Economists’  estimates  ranged from deficits of $37
billion to $41.5 billion.  
 The figures follow a July 10 report that China’s trade
surplus widened in June to the highest this year as exports
increased to a record. The gap jumped 140 percent from a year
earlier, while exports surged 44 percent.  
 China’s Currency  
 The rise in exports may prompt U.S. lawmakers to intensify
pressure on China to step up the pace of yuan appreciation even
as the outlook for overseas demand cools.  
 China on June 19 indicated it was ending the yuan’s two-
year peg to the U.S. dollar and has since allowed it to
appreciate 0.8 percent. The U.S. Treasury Department said July 8
the Chinese currency “remains undervalued.”  
 A decrease in the cost of oil probably slowed  import  gains
in May. A barrel of crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange
averaged $74.12 for the month, down from $84.58 in April. The
price dropped to $74.95 yesterday.  
 Gains in U.S. consumer spending and business investment
suggest a retreat in demand for goods made abroad will not last.
Household  purchases  increased 0.2 percent in May after no change
the previous month, while  inventories  at wholesalers rose in May
for a fifth month, according to figures from the Commerce
Department.  
 Exports, Dollar  
 The outlook for  exports  has dimmed after the dollar climbed
3 percent since mid-April against a trade-weighted
basket of currencies of major trading partners amid concerns
that efforts to reduce government debt in Europe will hamper the
economic recovery. In addition to making American goods more
expensive to European buyers, the dollar’s appreciation will
also weigh on sales in places where U.S. companies compete with
European firms.  
 Sovereign-debt concerns in Europe have translated to stock-
market declines in the U.S. The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  has
dropped 11 percent since a recent high on April 23.  
 Some manufacturers such as Moline, Illinois-based Deere are
optimistic the recovery will be sustained.  
 “We do believe the recovery is under way,”  Samuel Allen ,
chief executive officer of Deere, said in an interview June 23.
“We do believe it is moving slowly. We do believe it is on
stable ground at this time.”  
 Factory Shipments  
 A report this month from the Institute for Supply
Management showed a  measure of exports  fell in June to the
lowest level this year while registering the biggest monthly
drop since December 2008. Other reports this month signaled the
global economy is cooling after manufacturing weakened in Europe
and China.  
 U.S. President  Barack Obama  has made export growth a key
economic policy initiative. Last week, Obama reiterated the
administration’s goal of doubling U.S. exports during the next
five years to about $3.1 trillion by 2015, supporting 2 million
additional jobs.  
 “Export growth leads to job growth and economic growth,”
Obama said on July 7. Exports in 2008 accounted for about one in
three manufacturing jobs and pay 15 percent more on average, he
said. “So at a time when jobs are in short supply, building
exports is an imperative.”
