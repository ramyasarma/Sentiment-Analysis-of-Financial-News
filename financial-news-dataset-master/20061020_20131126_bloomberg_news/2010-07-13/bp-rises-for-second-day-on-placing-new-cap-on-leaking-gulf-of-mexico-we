             BP Plc  rose for a second day after
installing a new cap on the leaking Macondo well in the Gulf of
Mexico to halt the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 BP gained as much as 5.2 percent in London trading and
traded at 411.40 pence as of 9:55 a.m. The shares have jumped 30
percent this month for the second-best best performance in the
 MSCI World Index  after  Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  BP is still down
37 percent since the April 20 accident on the Deepwater Horizon
rig that killed 11 workers and started the leak.  
 The cap may be able to cut off the flow of oil and gas from
the ocean floor before relief wells intersect the well close to
the bottom to permanently plug it. Stopping the leak would allow
the company to quantify the cost of containing and cleaning up
the spill after spending $3.5 billion so far.  
 “There is much greater confidence in stemming the flow of
oil,” said  Peter Hutton , a London-based analyst at NCB
Stockbrokers Ltd. “The new cap tides them over until the well
is killed. The stock was in freefall, so it’s time to buy.”  
 BP installed the new cap yesterday and will start testing
today whether this will stop the gusher while work continues on
a permanent plug. After placing a 40-foot (12-meter) stack of
valves atop the well yesterday, the company will use it to halt
the oil flow for as long as 48 hours to measure pressure,  Doug Suttles , chief operating officer for exploration and production,
told reporters.  
 Ahead of Total  
 The  share-price gains  have restored BP to its position as
Europe’s second-biggest oil company by market capitalization
after  Royal Dutch Shell Group Plc , overtaking Paris-based  Total
SA . BP had overtaken Shell at the start of the year as shares
climbed to a year-high of 655 pence on the day of the Gulf
accident.  
 BP now has a  market value  of 78 billion pounds ($117
billion), compared with Shell’s 109 billion pounds and Total’s
market capitalization of 92 billion euros ($115 billion). BP has
lost about 46 billion pounds off its market value since April.  
 After promising President Barack Obama to set aside $20
billion for cleanup and litigation, BP is selling assets,
reducing investment and canceling its dividend for three
quarters. BP is in talks to sell assets in Alaska to Apache
Corp. for less than $12 billion, people familiar with the matter
said earlier this week.
