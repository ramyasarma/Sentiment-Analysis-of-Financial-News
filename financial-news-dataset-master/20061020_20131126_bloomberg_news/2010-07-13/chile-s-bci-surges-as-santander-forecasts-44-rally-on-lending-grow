             Banco de Credito & Inversiones  rose
the most in 15 years as Banco Santander SA said Chile’s third-
largest bank by market value is set to benefit more than rivals
from accelerating loan demand as the economy recovers.  
 BCI climbed 8.2 percent to a record 25,660 pesos, the
biggest advance since June 1995. Chile’s main equity index, the
Ipsa, rose 0.9 percent to a record 4,203.70.  
 The stock, Santander’s favorite among the three Chilean
banks it covers, may rally 44 percent to $64 (34,230 pesos) by
the end of next year, analysts  Boris Molina  and  Carlos Herrera 
said in an e-mailed note.  Banco de Chile , the second-largest
lender, will probably rise 20 percent to $80, while  Corpbanca 
will likely climb 11 percent to $58.50, they wrote, without
commenting on  Banco Santander Chile , the largest lender.  
 BCI’s “strong” presence in small- and mid-sized business
lending gives it “an inexpensive and fast means to outpace the
sector’s growth in this category,” they wrote. “Meanwhile, its
consumer lending operation is set for a recovery, as it shifts
its focus from containing asset quality deterioration to
recovery of market share lost in recent years, particularly in
the middle- and low-income segments.”  
 Chile’s economy probably will expand 4.6 percent this year,
rebounding from last year’s slump and February’s earthquake, and
accelerate to 5.7 percent next year, the analysts wrote,
forecasting loan growth of 14 percent this year.  
 “Consumer loans should benefit from pent-up demand from
postponed consumption during the crisis, and from the
replacement of durable goods damaged by the earthquake,”
Santander wrote.  
 Banco de Chile climbed 5.1 percent to 62 pesos, Corpbanca
advanced 1.7 percent to 5.755 pesos and Banco Santander Chile
gained 3.8 percent to 39.66 pesos.
