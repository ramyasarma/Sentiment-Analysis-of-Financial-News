             Brazil’s  retail sales  increased less
than economists forecast in May, raising expectations that the
central bank may slow the pace of interest rate increases.  
 Sales climbed 10.2 percent in May from a year ago and 1.4
percent from April, the national statistics agency said today on
its website. Economists had predicted an annual increase of 10.7
percent and a monthly increase of 1.8 percent, according to the
median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The retail sales data, together with slower-than-expected
industrial production growth in May, suggests that the economic
expansion slowed in the second quarter from the 9 percent pace
seen in the first quarter, said  Luciano Rostagno , chief Brazil
strategist at Madrid-based CM Capital Markets. Yields on
interest rate futures maturing next year and later declined.  
 “With this data showing that the Brazilian economy is
decelerating more than expected, analysts are now examining the
possibility that the central bank will reduce the pace of
interest rate tightening at its September meeting,” Rostagno
said in a telephone interview.  
 Brazil’s economy expanded at the  fastest pace  since 1995 in
the first quarter, led by domestic demand and a record surge in
investment. In March, retail sales rose 15.7 percent from a year
earlier, the most since at least 2001.  
 The central bank raised interest rates twice this year to
10.25 percent from a record low 8.75 percent in March in a bid
to prevent the economy from overheating.  
 Monetary Policy  
 The slower growth will assist the central bank in keeping
inflation under control, said  Andre Perfeito , an economist at
Sao Paulo-based Gradual Investimentos, with 2.5 billion reais
($1.43 billion) in assets under management.  
 “It’s good for monetary policy,” Perfeito said. “The
slower-than-expected growth suggests we don’t need a bigger
increase in the Selic rate.”  
 Perfeito is forecasting a Selic rate of 11.5 percent to 12
percent at the end of 2010.  
 Supermarket and hypermarket sales rose 4.3 percent in May
from the previous month. This was because May had one more
weekend than April, Rostagno said.  
 The bank will raise the benchmark Selic rate to 11 percent
at its July 20-21 meeting, and to 12 percent by year end,
according to a July 9 central bank survey of about 100
economists.  
 Brazil’s benchmark inflation rate may stay above the
government’s 4.5 percent midpoint target until the second
quarter of 2012, the central bank said in its quarterly
inflation report June 30.  
 The yield on the interest-rate future contract due January
2011, the most traded on the Sao Paulo BM&F futures exchange
today, fell one basis point at 11.31 percent at 10:25 a.m. New
York time.  
 The real strengthened 0.6 percent to 1.7508 per U.S. dollar
from 1.7607 yesterday, pushing its 12-month gain to 13 percent
against the dollar, the second-best performance among the 16
most-traded currencies after New Zealand’s dollar.
