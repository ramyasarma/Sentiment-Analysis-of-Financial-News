             Southern California house and
condominium prices rose 13 percent in June from a year earlier
as buyers took advantage of state tax credits and low interest
rates, research company MDA DataQuick said.  
 The median price climbed to $300,000, MDA DataQuick said
today in a statement. The report encompasses Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura
counties, the San Diego-based company said.  
 Rates for  30-year fixed mortgages  fell to the lowest on
record for the third straight week on July 8, reducing borrowing
costs for homebuyers, according to mortgage-finance company
Freddie Mac. In California, buyers can qualify for a tax credit
of as much as $10,000 under a program that began May 1.  
 “We’re still seeing lots of bargain hunting, and we’re not
seeing much discretionary buying,”  John Walsh , president of MDA
DataQuick, said in the statement. “The single-biggest issue is
still mortgage financing. Rates may be at record lows, but that
doesn’t mean much if the lender won’t qualify you.”  
 A total of 23,871 new and existing homes sold last month in
the six Southern California counties tracked by MDA DataQuick,
up 7.2 percent from May and 2.6 percent from a year earlier. The
sales count was the highest since July 2009, when 24,104 homes
sold, the research company said.  
 Sales of foreclosed homes accounted for almost a third of
the resale market, down from 45 percent a year earlier. The
proportion reached a record of almost 57 percent in February
2009, MDA DataQuick said.  
 Orange County  
 The number of homes sold rose in Orange, San Diego, Los
Angeles and Ventura counties, and fell in San Bernardino and
Riverside counties, MDA DataQuick said. The biggest rise was in
 Orange County , where sales gained 16 percent to 3,423.  
 On an annual basis, prices rose in all six Southern
California counties. They climbed the most in San Bernardino
County, where the median gained 14 percent from a year earlier
to $160,000.  
 MDA DataQuick is a unit of Richmond, British Columbia-based
 MacDonald, Dettwiler & Associates Ltd.  It compiles surveys using
county records and supplies real-estate information to public
agencies, lenders and title companies.
