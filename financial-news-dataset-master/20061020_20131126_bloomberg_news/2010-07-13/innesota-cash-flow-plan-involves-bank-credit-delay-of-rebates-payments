             Minnesota  will delay refunds for
overpayment of corporate and sales taxes for the second year
running, postpone state aid to schools and medical providers and
set up a $600 million bank line of credit.  
 The measures are necessary to manage cash flow in the
 fiscal year  that began July 1, state Management and Budget
Commissioner  Tom Hanson  told a legislative committee in St. Paul
yesterday. Without them the state general fund will run out of
cash as soon as October, Kristin Dybdal, state budget director,
told members of the Legislative Advisory Commission at a
hearing.  
 The commission took no action, and several lawmakers were
critical of the plan to set up a credit line with Minneapolis-
based  US Bancorp , the winner of a request for proposals on
short-term borrowing earlier this year.  
 “At some level if you continue short-term borrowing you’re
just pouring gasoline on the deterioration,” said Senate
Majority Leader  Larry Pogemiller , from Minneapolis.  
 Hanson said he hopes to avoid the need for any borrowing.  
 “I am going to try everything I can to make sure the state
doesn’t have to short-term borrow,” he said. He said he has the
authority to set up the line of credit without further action by
the commission.  
 The committee declined to vote on a recommendation on the
financing plan. Earlier this year Democrats in the state Senate
tried unsuccessfully to win passage of an income-tax surcharge
on wealthy residents that would have raised about $440 million
for the 2011 budget.
