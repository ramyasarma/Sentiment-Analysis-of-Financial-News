             Coach Harry Redknapp extended his
contract at Tottenham Hotspur until 2013, the Premier League
soccer team said on its website.  
 Tottenham came fourth in the standings last season, its
best finish in the Premier League, which started in 1992. Spurs
thereby earned a place in the final qualifying round for next
season’s elite Champions League.  
 The club’s achievements in the last campaign helped Redknapp
win the Barclays Manager of the Season award.
