             Northrop Grumman Corp. , the biggest
maker of vessels for the U.S. Navy, said it’s studying options
for its shipbuilding unit that include a possible sale or
spinoff.  
 “We foresee little synergy between shipbuilding and our
other businesses,” Chief Executive Officer  Wes Bush  said today
in a statement. “It is now appropriate to explore separating
shipbuilding from Northrop Grumman.”  
 Northrop acquired the shipbuilding business of Litton
Industries Inc. in 2001 and Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. a
year later, adding military vessels to a lineup that included
aircraft and electronics. Shipbuilding  sales  in 2009 were $6.21
billion, or 17 percent of Los Angeles-based Northrop’s $33.8
billion in total revenue.  
 Operations at a shipyard in Avondale, Louisiana, will be
moved to a facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi, to cut costs
while the company considers options for the unit, Northrop said.  
 The consolidation will result in a $113 million pretax
charge for the second quarter, Northrop said. After a previously
disclosed $296 million tax benefit, profit from continuing
operations for the quarter will increase by 73 cents a share,
the company said.  
 Northrop  rose  88 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $56.14 in
extended trading at 6:02 p.m. in New York. That extended a 1.3
percent gain earlier in the day.
