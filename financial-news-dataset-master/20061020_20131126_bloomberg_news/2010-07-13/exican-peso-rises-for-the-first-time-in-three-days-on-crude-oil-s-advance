             Mexico’s peso gained for the first
time in three days as oil, the nation’s largest export, rose.  
 The currency increased 0.5 percent to 12.7693 per dollar at
8:54 a.m. New York time, from 12.8349 yesterday. The peso has
jumped 2.4 percent this year against the U.S. dollar, the
second-best performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, after Japan’s yen.  
 “Oil is doing a lot better,” said  Bertrand Delgado , a
senior economist at Roubini Global Economics LLC in New York.
“Still, we are entering a period of volatility as earnings
season begins in the U.S.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery rose 1.3 percent to $75.92 a
barrel, the fourth increase in five days.  
 The yield on the 10 percent benchmark bond due in 2024 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.07 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.32 centavo to 126.41 centavos on the peso.
