             China may allow imports of beef from
Argentina later this year, Carlos Alberto Vuegen, general
manager of the Argentine Beef Promotion Institute, said in an
interview in Beijing.  
 The nations haven’t reached a concrete agreement during
Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s visit to
China this week, Vuegen said. Progress on the agreement was made
during the trip and the matter can be agreed upon when a Chinese
delegation visits Argentina in October, Vuegen said, without
elaborating.
