             A Western New York man who claims he
owns 84 percent of Facebook Inc., the world’s biggest social
networking service, sued and won a state court order temporarily
restricting Facebook from transferring assets.  
 Paul Ceglia, of Wellsville, New York, sued Facebook and its
founder and Chief Executive Officer  Mark Elliot Zuckerberg  in
state court in New York’s Allegany County on June 30. In the
suit, Ceglia claims that a contract he and Zuckerberg signed in
April 2003 entitles Ceglia to ownership of most of the privately
held company.  
 The day of Ceglia’s filing, without notice to Palo Alto,
California-based Facebook, Acting New York Supreme Court Justice
Thomas P. Brown signed an order blocking Zuckerberg and Facebook
“from transferring, selling, assigning any assets, stocks,
bonds, owned, possessed and/or controlled by the defendants,”
at least until a hearing set for July 9.  
 Facebook transferred the case to federal court in Buffalo,
New York, and is trying to get the order annulled. In court
papers, the company points to the “outlandishness” of Ceglia’s
claim to ownership of Facebook. The company also claims that a
suit over a contract allegedly broken in 2003 is “almost
certainly barred” by the statute of limitation for such claims.  
 Barry Schnitt , a Facebook spokesman, said the company
believes the suit is frivolous and will defend itself
vigorously.  
 The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 10-CV-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of New York (Buffalo).
