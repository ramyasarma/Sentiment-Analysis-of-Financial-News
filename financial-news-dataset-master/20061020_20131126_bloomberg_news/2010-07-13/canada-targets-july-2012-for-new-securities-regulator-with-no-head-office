             Canadian policy makers today
released a plan for establishing a new national securities
regulator on July 1, 2012, that includes a recommendation the
new watchdog not have a central head office.  
 The Canadian Securities Transitions Office, which has a
three-year mandate to help Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  create
a national regulator, issued a “roadmap” today that calls for
the regulator to consist of regional offices across Canada.  
 Canada is the only member of the Group of Seven nations
without a national securities watchdog, a situation the
government calls an “international embarrassment.” Flaherty on
May 27 released draft  legislation  to set up a national oversight
body, a move that is opposed by the provinces of Quebec, Alberta
and Manitoba. The legislation has been submitted to the Supreme
Court of Canada for a ruling on whether it’s constitutional.  
 Under Flaherty’s plan, provinces that decide not to take
part will have the right to keep regulatory powers over capital
markets.
