             Matsuya Co., a Japanese department-
store chain, rose the most in seven weeks in Tokyo trading after
tripling its first-half net income outlook on higher-than-
expected sales.   
 Matsuya gained 4.7 percent to 784 yen as of 9:09 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, headed for the biggest advance since
May 24. The benchmark Topix index added 0.5 percent.
