             MTR Corp. , the builder of a HK$66.9
billion ($8.6 billion) high-speed  train line  in Hong Kong, said
work on the railway may be completed ahead of schedule because
of government support and commitments from contractors.  
 Piling and tunneling work has already begun,  Chew Tai-Chong ,
MTR’s projects director, said today at a conference in the city.
The work is also likely to come in on budget, he said. He didn’t
elaborate on a possible finishing date for the line, which is
due to be completed by August 2015.  
 Contractors will dig up 10 million cubic-meters of rock,
soil and other materials while constructing the 26 kilometer (16
mile) underground railway, which will run from downtown Hong
Kong to the border with China, Chew said. Hong Kong lawmakers in
January approved funding for the project to help cut travel
times to Chinese cities after two earlier votes were delayed
because of objections about costs and the demolition of houses.  
 High-speed railways “can bring in economic benefits,”
said Stephen Ip, a Shanghai-based partner for transactions and
restructuring at consultancy  KPMG . “It’s the ability to have
better public transportation in terms of reliability, frequency,
comfort and safety.”  
 Contracts Awarded  
 Government-controlled MTR has awarded 14 major contracts
for work on the railway with a total value of HK$18 billion,
Chew said. Contractors will be able to find the 9,000 workers
needed for the project locally, rather than having to import
labor from China, he said.  
 MTR , which also operates Hong Kong’s subways, fell 0.9
percent to HK$27.30 at the close of trading in the city. The
company has risen 1.9 percent this year, compared with a 6.6
percent decline for the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  
 Trains will run at speeds of as high as 350 kilometers per
hour (217 miles an hour) on the new line, which will form part
of a 140-kilometer railway running to Shenzhen and Guangzhou.  
 The line will also link into a planned  16,000-kilometer 
Chinese high-speed rail network and will cut Hong Kong-to-
Beijing train journey times by more than half to 10 hours,
according to MTR’s  website .  
 Hong Kong’s government plans to construct an underground
terminal for the railway in West Kowloon, which is across
Victoria Harbor from Hong Kong Island. The district is also
being developed as a finance center.  
 The line will save the Hong Kong public 40 million hours
per year, generating an annual economic rate of return of 9
percent, according to a government paper.
