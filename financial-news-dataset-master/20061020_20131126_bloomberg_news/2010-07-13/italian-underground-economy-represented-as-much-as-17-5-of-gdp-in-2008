             Italy’s underground economy was
valued at between 16.3 percent and 17.5 percent of gross
domestic product in 2008, statistics office Istat said today in
an e-mailed statement.  
 The cash value of the underground economy reached as much
as 275 billion euros ($344.6 billion) in 2008, Istat said. The
underground economy as a percentage of GDP has tended to decline
since reaching a high of as much as 19.7 percent in 2001, Istat
said.  
 Istat includes an estimate of the underground economy in
its quarterly GDP calculations.
