             Argentine benchmark dollar bonds
rose to the highest price in more than three months after Fitch
Ratings lifted the country’s rating out of default.  
 The yield on the country’s 7 percent dollar bonds due in
2015 slid 29 basis points, or 0.29 percentage point, to 11.47
percent at 4:32 p.m. New York time, according to pricing from
Deutsche Bank AG. The price rose 1 cent to 84.8 cents on the
dollar, the highest level since March 29.  
 Fitch yesterday raised Argentina’s long-term foreign
currency issuer rating out of default, citing the nation’s
second defaulted debt swap offer that closed last month.  
 “The news from Fitch and the good external risk appetite
are generating another positive session today,” said  Noelia Lucini , a portfolio manager with Capital Markets Argentina in
Buenos Aires.  
 Argentina defaulted on about $95 billion in debt in
December 2001 and offered an earlier restructuring in 2005. This
year’s swap offer brought total creditor participation above 90
percent, meriting the upgrade of Argentina’s long-term foreign
currency rating from RD to B with a stable outlook, Fitch said.  
 The yield on dollar bonds due in 2017, issued in this
year’s swap to compensate creditors for past due investment,
dropped six basis points to 11.02 percent. Argentina suspended
plans to sell up to $1 billion of the notes during the
restructuring after the European debt crisis pushed yields above
the “one-digit” target set by Economy Minister  Amado Boudou .  
 “We are getting close to that yield,” said Lucini. “I
think the government will want to take advantage of the window
of opportunity and go to market.”  
 Argentina’s peso rose 0.1 percent to 3.9326 per dollar from
3.9363 yesterday.
