             India, the world’s second-biggest
producer of rice, wheat and sugar, needs 14 million tons of
extra storage capacity to stockpile food grains, Farm Minister
Sharad Pawar said today in New Delhi.  
 The government needs to spend 40 billion rupees to fill the
“storage gap,” Pawar said.  
 State-owned Food Corp. of India will hire warehouses from
private trading companies to store record volumes of rice and
wheat bought from farmers, Pawar said.
