             Siemens AG, the German maker of the
ICE high-speed train, is poised to clinch a 2.2 billion-euro
($2.8 billion) order from Russia for 240  regional trains , as
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  works to upgrade infrastucture.  
 The Munich-based company will sign a memorandum of
understanding on July 15 with OAO Russian Railways for delivery
of the trains in the next decade, Siemens spokesman  Marc Langendorf  said. The company will sign the accord during a visit
by German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to Russia and China.  
 Russia’s government in 2008 approved a railway development
program allowing the Russian railway company to invest about 380
billion euros by 2030 to modernize rolling stock and the track
network, the world’s second-largest.  
 The trains will be a version of Siemens’s  Desiro  regional
model already sold to Hungary’s state railway and London’s
Heathrow Express service. The trains will partly be made in
Russia, Langendorf said.
