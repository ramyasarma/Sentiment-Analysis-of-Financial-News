             The U.S. government posted a smaller
budget deficit in June compared with the same month last year as
the economic recovery brought in more tax revenue.  
 The excess of spending over receipts fell to $68.4 billion
last month from $94.3 billion in June 2009, according to a
Treasury Department report issued today in Washington. It was
the 21st consecutive shortfall. For the fiscal year to date, the
budget deficit totaled $1 trillion compared with $1.42 trillion
during the prior year to date.  
 Even as the economy recovers from the deepest recession
since the 1930s, the budget deficit is forecast to reach a
record $1.6 trillion this fiscal year as the government funds
efforts to revive growth and employment. The mounting shortfalls
underscore the challenge facing the Obama administration.  
 “Tax receipts are growing at a pretty good rate,” said
 Brian Bethune , chief financial economist at IHS Global Insight
in Lexington, Massachusetts. “We’re getting a lot of traction in
the non-financial sector. It’s pretty powerful.”  
 Year to date, the gap amounted to 9.2 percent of gross
domestic product, down from 10.2 percent for the same period in
2009.  
 The government’s June budget deficit compares with the $69
billion economists anticipated, based on the median of 35
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Projections ranged from
deficits of $62 billion to $103.9 billion.  
 CBO Estimate  
 A report from the Commerce Department today showed the U.S.
trade gap unexpectedly widened in May to the highest level in 18
months as a gain in imports outpaced an increase in shipments
abroad. The  gap  expanded 4.8 percent to $42.3 billion as U.S.
companies imported more capital equipment, automobiles and
consumer goods.  
 The budget figures were in line the estimate issued by the
non-partisan Congressional Budget Office issued July 8, which
projected a narrowing to $69 billion. “Because Memorial Day
fell on the last day of May this year, some receipts were
shifted from May into June,” the CBO said.  
 The increase in  revenue  reflected a gain in corporate
taxes. Receipts and other income climbed 17 percent to $251
billion in June from the same month last year, according to the
Treasury.  
 Corporate Taxes  
 Corporate tax receipts were up 30 percent for the fiscal
year to date to $133 billion from the same period in 2009.
Individual income tax collections are down 4.4 percent year to
date to $655.4 billion.  
 Spending  for the entire government for June increased 3.2
percent from the same month a year earlier to $319.5 billion.
Spending by the Defense Department year to date rose to $499.1
billion from $472.8 billion in 2009. Outlays by the Social
Security Administration increased to $564.2 billion for the
fiscal year to date from $544.7 billion.  
 Spending by the Department of Health and Human Services,
which administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, climbed to
$631.4 billion.  
 President  Barack Obama ’s budget office will release its
revised forecast for the U.S. economy on July 23, spokesman
 Kenneth Baer  said on July 9. The Office of Management and
Budget’s mid-session review will provide an update on the
expected growth in the economy, unemployment and the deficit for
fiscal 2010, which ends on Sept. 30. The Obama administration’s
budget proposal was sent to Congress in February.  
 The president today named  Jack Lew , currently a top aide to
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as head of the OMB.  
 Lew would have to develop an austere budget that charts a
path toward fulfilling Obama’s commitment to cutting the 2009
deficit of $1.4 trillion in half in five years. That would be
accomplished partly through a freeze on spending outside of
defense and national security programs, as outlined by Obama in
February.
