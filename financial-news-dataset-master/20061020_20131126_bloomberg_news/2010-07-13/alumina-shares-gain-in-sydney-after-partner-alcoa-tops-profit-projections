             Alumina Ltd.  shares rose in Sydney
trading after its partner Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts’
expectations.  
 Alumina gained 2.3 percent to A$1.585 at 10:17 a.m. Sydney
time on the Australian stock exchange. The Melbourne-based
company and New York-based Alcoa are partners in the Alcoa World
Alumina & Chemical venture, the world’s biggest producer of the
material used to make aluminum.  
 Alcoa yesterday said its earnings from continuing
operations were 13 cents a share, exceeding the 11-cent average
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales gained 22
percent to $5.19 billion. Aluminum for delivery in three months
on the London Metal Exchange averaged 39 percent higher in the
quarter from a year earlier.  
 AWAC produces one quarter of the world’s alumina. The
venture is expected to produce 15.6 million metric tons of
alumina this year, down 200,000 tons from an earlier forecast,
Alumina said today in a statement.  
 Alumina is scheduled to report its first-half earnings on
Aug. 10.
