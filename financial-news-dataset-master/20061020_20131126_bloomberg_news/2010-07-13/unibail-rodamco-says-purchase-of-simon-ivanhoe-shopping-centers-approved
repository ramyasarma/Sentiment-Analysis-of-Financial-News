             Unibail-Rodamco SE said Polish
authorities approved its acquisition of Simon Ivanhoe’s Arkadia
and Wilenska shopping centers in Poland. Unibail-Rodamco must
relinquish its management role at another shopping center as a
condition to the transaction’s approval, the company said. The
purchase will be closed in “the next few days,” Unibail-
Rodamco said.
