             Arrow Energy Ltd.  said it hasn’t
received formal word that China has approved the A$3.5 billion
($3.1 billion) takeover of the Australian coal-seam gas producer
by PetroChina Co. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  
 PetroChina will advise its partners of the Chinese
government’s decision on the transaction “very, very soon,”
spokesman  Mao Zefeng  said by phone from Hong Kong today. Arrow
shareholders meet tomorrow to vote on the proposed deal, the
Brisbane-based company said in a statement.  
 Shell, BG Group Plc, Santos Ltd. and ConocoPhillips are
among companies planning more than $40 billion of investment in
Queensland projects that will convert gas extracted from coal
seams into liquefied natural gas.  PetroChina  needs approval from
the country’s National Development and Reform Commission and the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange for the takeover.  
 Arrow, which has  climbed  20 percent this year, increased
0.4 percent to A$4.96 at 2:44 p.m. in Sydney trading. This
compares with a 0.4 percent decline in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200
Index.  
 PetroChina and Shell won Chinese government approval for
the acquisition last week, the Australian Financial Review
reported today, citing a PetroChina spokesman it didn’t identify.
Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board approved the bid in
April.  
 Shell and PetroChina agreed in March to buy Arrow’s
Australian business for A$4.70 a share in cash. The deal will
give Shell access to Arrow’s coal-seam gas reserves to support a
proposed Curtis Island LNG project, one of more than a dozen in
Australia aimed at tapping rising Asian demand for the fuel.
