             The drop in U.S. oil output may
worsen 10-fold through 2015 as projects are delayed because of
the clamp down on offshore drilling after  BP Plc’s  crude spill
in the Gulf of Mexico, the  International Energy Agency  said.  
 The Macondo spill, the largest in U.S. history, has
“already shaved” off 30,000 barrels a day of estimated U.S.
crude production in 2010 and 2011, Paris-based IEA said today in
its monthly report. The reduction may expand to between 100,000
barrels and 300,000 barrels a day in 2015, it said.  
 U.S. Interior Secretary  Kenneth Salazar  yesterday announced
a revised policy for deepwater drilling, which may let some
deepwater work resume earlier than the six-month pause ordered
by President Barack Obama’s administration May 27. The new
regulation may do little to restart projects, industry groups
and analysts said.  
 “In practice, new deepwater drilling remains halted,” the
IEA said. “The uncertainty surrounding the deepwater drilling
moratorium begins to have an impact on new upstream projects.”  
 Regulations in the aftermath of the spill may delay global
supply by 900,000 barrels a day by 2015, including 300,000
barrels a day from the Gulf of Mexico,  Fatih Birol , the IEA
chief economist, said last month.  
 The U.S. Energy Department July 7 forecast output
reductions to average 31,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter
of this year and about 82,000 barrels a day in 2011.  
 Citigroup Inc. analyst Mark Fletcher said in May that U.S.
Gulf production may be reduced by 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of
oil equivalent a day this year, citing estimates from Wood
Mackenzie Consultants Ltd.
