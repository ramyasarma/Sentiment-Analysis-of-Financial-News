             European banks that fail stress
tests will “in the worst case” need government aid to
strengthen their balance sheets, German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said.  
 “The goal is to make it clear that European banks are
stable and wherever there are problems, there have to be
consequences,” Schaeuble said in an interview on
 Deutschlandradio  today. The stress tests “won’t create
disturbances, but rather clarity,” he said.  
 European Union regulators are examining the strength of 91
banks to determine whether they can survive potential losses on
sovereign-bond holdings.  
 “If it turns out that a bank, under certain assumptions,
has too little capital, then it has to get more capital or
reduce its balance sheet,” Schaeuble told the German
broadcaster. “And if a bank isn’t capable of doing that on its
own, the national states in the worst case have to do what we in
Germany had to do two years ago during the banking crisis with
the banking stabilization fund.”  
 Germany set up the 480 billion-euro ($603 billion) bank-
rescue fund, known as Soffin, after  Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.  collapsed in 2008. Schaeuble commented from Brussels, where
he’s attending a European finance ministers’ meeting,
Deutschlandradio said.
