             India’s  10-year bonds  slipped on
concern investors will refrain from adding to their positions
before data tomorrow that economists forecast will show
 inflation  accelerated to a three-month high in June.  
 Yields rose after the government said yesterday it will
sell 130 billion rupees ($2.8 billion) of notes maturing in 2017,
2022 and 2027 on July 16. The wholesale price index increased
10.8 percent last month from a year earlier, after climbing 10.2
percent in May, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists.  
 “Some clarity will emerge on the interest-rate front after
the inflation data is published,” said  Mukesh Kumar , a Mumbai-
based fixed-income trader at State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur.
“Demand is also likely to be damped before bond auctions.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.62 percent as of the
5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The price fell 0.06, or 6 paise per 100 rupee
face amount, to 101.21.  
 The central bank, in an unscheduled decision on July 2,
increased the  reverse-repurchase rate  to 4 percent from 3.75
percent and the  repurchase rate  to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent,
the third increase of the year. The Reserve Bank of India’s next
policy meeting is set for July 27.  
 Double Digit  
 The central bank may raise borrowing costs for a second
time this month to slow inflation, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s top economic advisers signaled today.  
 “If inflation persists at double-digit levels for several
months together, some action by the Reserve Bank is required,”
 Chakravarthy Rangarajan , chairman of the Prime Minister’s
Economic Advisory Council, said in New Delhi.  
 Montek Singh Ahluwalia , deputy chairman of the Planning
Commission, said the “RBI should make whatever adjustments it
feels necessary” as inflation above 10 percent is “not
acceptable.”  
 The central bank expects the inflation rate to jump by
about a percentage point after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s
government raised fuel prices last month.  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating rates,
declined five basis points to 5.66 percent.
