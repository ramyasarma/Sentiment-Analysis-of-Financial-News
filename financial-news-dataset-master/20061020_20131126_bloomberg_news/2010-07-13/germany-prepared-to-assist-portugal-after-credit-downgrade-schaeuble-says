             German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said he’s ready to offer “advice and assistance” to
Portugal after Moody’s Investors Service lowered the country’s
credit rating by two levels to A1.  
 “Of course we’ve taken note of the downgrade decision by
Moody’s,” Schaueble told reporters after a meeting of European
finance ministers in Brussels today. “I’ve agreed with my
Portuguese colleague”  Fernando Teixeira dos Santos  to meet
after “our holidays to see what can be done bilaterally as
regards information, but also advice and assistance.”  
 The Portuguese government has raised taxes and cut spending
to rein in the euro region’s fourth-largest budget deficit,
which is threatening to crimp growth in an economy that has
barely expanded in a decade. Euro-region states including Spain
are adopting austerity measures after Greece’s near-default
pushed up borrowing costs and prompted the European Union to
establish a 750 billion-euro ($941 billion) financial backstop.  
 Portugal had held the third-highest Moody’s investment
grade since 1998. Moody’s isn’t planning further action and is
“very confident” Portugal will trim its deficit to 3 percent
of gross domestic product by 2013,  Anthony Thomas , lead analyst
at Moody’s for Portugal, said today in a telephone interview.  
 “Portugal is still in the A-rating range,” Schaeuble
said. The country “has taken relevant measures, just like other
countries.”
