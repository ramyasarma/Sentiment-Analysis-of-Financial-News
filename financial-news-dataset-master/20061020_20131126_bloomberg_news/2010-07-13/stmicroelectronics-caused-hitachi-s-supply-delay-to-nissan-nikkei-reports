             Hitachi Ltd.’s delay in supplying
electronic controls to Nissan Motor Co. was caused by
STMicroelectronics NV’s failure to meet a microchip order,
Nikkei English News said, without citing anyone.   
 Nissan and Hitachi executives visited the offices of
STMicroelectronics in Europe for talks on the resumption of full
supplies, the report said.  
 STMicroelectronics said on July 2 it could only supply
about 80 percent of the 120,000 chips for Nissan vehicles that
it was supposed to ship under contract, the Nikkei said, citing
unidentified officials at Hitachi.
