             Morgan Stanley , the world’s second-
biggest merger adviser, hired JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  Thomas M. Miles , who helped arrange takeovers for companies such as UAL
Corp.’s United Airlines and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.  
 Miles, a managing director in JPMorgan’s M&A group, will
take a similar role at Morgan Stanley when he joins later this
year, Morgan Stanley spokesman  Mark Lake  confirmed. Miles worked
at JPMorgan since 1994.  
 Miles was part of the JPMorgan team that helped Chicago-
based UAL win an agreement in May to merge with Continental
Airlines Inc., creating the world’s largest airline. JPMorgan
stands to earn a $23 million fee for the assignment. Last year,
he advised Bristol-Myers, the New York drugmaker, on its $2.4
billion acquisition of Medarex Inc.  
 Morgan Stanley has been adding investment bankers from
competitors this year, hiring energy bankers  Michael Johnson ,
 Jonathan Cox , and  Eduardo Miras  from Deutsche Bank AG and
Citigroup Inc. financial-services specialist  Gary Shedlin. 
Outside of the investment bank, it’s hired 100 bankers to offer
loan products to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney clients, and may
quintuple that number by 2011, according to a person with
knowledge of the strategy.  
 Morgan Stanley is the second-biggest adviser on mergers
announced globally this year, behind Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan are ranked third and fourth.
