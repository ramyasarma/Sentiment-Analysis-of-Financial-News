             Anglo Platinum Ltd. , the world’s
largest producer of the metal, said first-half profit rose as
much as 15 percent from a year earlier as metal prices climbed.  
 Earnings per share advanced to between 12.53 rand ($1.65)
and 13.72 rand from 11.93 rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-
based company said in a stock exchange statement today. A more
detailed statement will be released on July 26, it said.  
 Platinum prices are recovering after plummeting in 2008 as
a recession in the world’s biggest economies cut demand for cars
and jewelry. Platinum, used in both, rose 37 percent over the
past year to $1,526.50 an ounce as of 11:13 p.m. in London. The
metal may trade at an average of $1,760 an ounce this year,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said on July 8.  
 Earnings excluding one-time items climbed four-fold to as
much as 10.44 rand, Anglo Platinum said. The difference between
the basic and headline earnings figures is the profit made on
the sale of a 37 percent stake in the Western Bushveld venture
to  Wesizwe Platinum Ltd. , it said.  
 Anglo Platinum raised output 11 percent to 446,700 refined
platinum ounces in the first quarter even after cutting 18,786
jobs and idling shafts to stem rising debt. The company may
produce more than its output target of 2.5 million refined
platinum ounces for the 2010 financial year, Chief Executive
Officer  Neville Nicolau  said in April.  
 The company, a unit of  Anglo American Plc , gained 15.99
rand, or 2.2 percent, to 736.50 rand in Johannesburg, giving it
a market value of 193.8 billion rand.
