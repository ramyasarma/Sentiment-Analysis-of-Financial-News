             BNP Paribas SA  and  PKO Bank Polski
SA , the largest lenders in France and Poland, are on the
shortlist to buy Allied Irish Banks Plc’s stake in Poland’s
Bank Zachodni WBK SA, a person familiar with the sale said.  
 PKO and BNP probably are the only banks that can offer AIB
a high enough price, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the details aren’t public.  
 AIB  needs to reach an agreement this year to sell its 70
percent holding in Poland’s third-biggest bank by market value, 
to help meet capital requirements set by Irish banking 
regulators. The stake is valued at 9.74 billion zloty ($3
billion) in Warsaw trading today.  
 Polish Treasury Minister  Aleksander Grad  said June 22
that the government would support state-controlled PKO’s bid for
Zachodni. Three days later, PKO’s shareholders postponed their
vote on a 2009 dividend until its chances to buy Zachodni become
clear and the bank announced plans last week to sell as much as
5 billion zloty of bonds to “speed up” expansion.  
 Katarzyna Zadlo, a spokeswoman for BNP Paribas in Warsaw,
declined to comment, as did  Elzbieta Anders , a spokeswoman for
PKO. Allied Irish spokesman  Ronan Sheridan  said the bank had no
comment to make.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc  and  UniCredit SpA  have dropped out of 
the bidding for Zachodni, a person familiar with the matter said
yesterday. HSBC and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA of Italy were among the
banks that placed initial bids last month, two people familiar
with the transaction said July 2.
