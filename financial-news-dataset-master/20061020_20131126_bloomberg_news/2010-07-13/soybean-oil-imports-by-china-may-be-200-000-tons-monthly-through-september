             China, the world’s biggest consumer
of vegetable oils, may import about 200,000 metric tons of
soybean oil each month from July to September, the portal
Grain.gov.cn said in an e-mailed report.  
 The prediction compares with about 40,000 tons of incoming
shipments in June, it said. Brazil is the largest supplier, with
about 80 percent, while the U.S. ships the rest, it said.  
 No shipments are likely from Argentina as China began to 
toughen quality requirements on its soybean oil exports in
April, it said. Buyers in China have stopped signing purchase
agreements with Argentina, it said. Argentina was the largest
soybean oil supplier prior to that, customs data show.
