             South African fruit and vegetable
prices may jump because of “severe” frost during the past
three weeks in the country’s Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces,
according to agricultural trade association  Agri SA .  
 Bananas, avocados and tomatoes in particular may become
more expensive, Agri SA President  Johannes Moller  said by mobile
phone today. “Those products will go up quite sharply between
now and the end of the year.”  
 Frost stunts the development of fruits and vegetables, and
in severe cases it kills the leaves of banana trees, meaning
they may have to be replanted, Moller said.  South Africa’s 
Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces produce bananas, mangoes and
vegetables including onions and potatoes.  
 “There has been a production loss,” said  Ernst Janovsky ,
general manager of  Absa Bank Ltd.’s  agriculture unit, in an
interview in Pretoria today. “Volumes are down. And when that
happens, the market reacts and gives you a higher price.”  
 Output of crops including avocados, tomatoes, bananas and
potatoes may drop 10 percent this season from a year earlier, he
said. Absa is the biggest lender to farmers in South Africa.  
 Wheat and wheat product prices may start to increase toward
the end of the year as South Africa boosts imports, Agri SA’s
Moller said. Red meat prices will also rise at that time, in
line with normal trends ahead of the Christmas holiday, he said.
