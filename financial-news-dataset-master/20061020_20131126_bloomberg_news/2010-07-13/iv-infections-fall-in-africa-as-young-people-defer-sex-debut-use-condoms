             Young people in the countries most
ravaged by AIDS are opting to delay sexual activity and have
fewer partners, helping stem the rate of new HIV infections, a
report shows.  
 Infections among young people have fallen by more than 25
percent in 15 of the 25 countries most affected by the AIDS-
causing virus, according to the report published by United
Nations today.  
 “Young people are adopting safer behaviors,”  Michel Sidibe ,
executive director of the UNAIDS program, said in a telephone
interview today. “Young people are choosing, for example, to
have sex later and to have fewer partners.”  
 The prevalence of HIV among pregnant women aged 15 to 24
fell 60 percent in Kenya between 2000 and 2005,  UNAIDS  said in
the report. Prevalence declined 56 percent in urban areas of
Malawi and Ivory Coast, and by half in Burundi and Haiti. Young
pregnant women are considered an indicator of the trend among
young people generally, UNAIDS said.  
 About 5 million people between the ages of 15 and 24 are
living with HIV, of which 80 percent live in sub-Saharan Africa,
according to the report. AIDS kills about 2 million people each
year, making it the most deadly infectious disease.  
 Providing treatment to all people who need it would help
avoid 10 million AIDS-related deaths by 2025, and prevent 1
million new infections a year, according to the report.
