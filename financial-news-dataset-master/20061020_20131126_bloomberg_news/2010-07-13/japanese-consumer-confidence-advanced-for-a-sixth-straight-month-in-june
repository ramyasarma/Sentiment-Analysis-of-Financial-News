             Japan’s household sentiment rose for
a sixth month in June, a sign that the world’s second-largest
economy is sustaining its expansion.  
 The  confidence index  climbed to 43.5 last month from
42.8 in May, the Cabinet Office said today in Tokyo. A number
below 50 means pessimists outnumber optimists.  
 Today’s report suggests Japan’s households haven’t been
deterred by a decline in stocks and a stronger yen spurred by
investor concerns the global recovery is moderating. Confidence
among large manufacturers climbed to a two-year high in June,
the Bank of Japan’s quarterly Tankan survey showed this month.  
 “The benefits of the economic recovery have already
started to spread to jobs and incomes, albeit at a very slow
pace,”  Azusa Kato , an economist at BNP Paribas in Tokyo, said
before the report was released. “But obviously, we’re still far
from a self-sustaining recovery in domestic demand.”  
 Reports for May showed that while the ratio of job openings
to applicants improved, unemployment worsened and wages fell.  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  has declined more than 15
percent since April 5, when it closed at its highest level in
more than a year. It fell for a second session today after Kan’s
ruling Democratic Party of Japan lost in an upper house election
on July 11. The yen has also risen 3.5 percent against the
dollar in the past month, eroding earnings prospects for
exporters.
