             South African food prices may rise 
because frost has affected crops and the costs of inputs such 
as electricity increased, Business Report said, citing National
Agricultural Marketing Council senior manager Andre Jooste.  
 The price of tomatoes may more than double as frost and 
cold damaged about 80,000 kilograms (176,368 pounds) of crops 
grown by ZZ2, a farming group that produces about 30 percent of
the country’s tomatoes, General Manager Henk van Zyl said. Corn
farmers are producing at a loss and need to reconsider planting
of the crop because of current surpluses, Agri SA Deputy 
Executive Director Johan Pienaar said.
