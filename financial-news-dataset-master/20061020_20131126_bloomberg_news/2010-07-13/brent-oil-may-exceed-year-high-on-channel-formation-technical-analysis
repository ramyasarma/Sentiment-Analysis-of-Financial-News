             Brent crude oil may surpass this
year’s high of $89.58 a barrel after prices rebounded against a
rising channel formation, according to technical analysis by
Standard Chartered Plc.  
 Brent futures rose 58 cents or, 0.8 percent, to $74.95 a
barrel at 11:50 a.m. on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, after gaining 5.3 percent last week. The commodity is
set to rise toward $83 after declines in the past two months
failed to extend below a channel that has bound prices for the
past year, indicating a long-term rising trend is still intact,
Standard Chartered said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  
 “Last week’s upturn in energy markets is starting to add
weight to the view that the dips were corrective in nature and
the price rally should extend,” analysts led by  Dan Smith  in
London said.  
 Standard Chartered forecast that Brent will first rebound
to $79.86 a barrel, the highest price of the past seven weeks,
reached on June 21. Oil may then proceed to $82.94, and then
potentially to this year’s peak of $89.58, reached on May 3,
according to the bank.  
 “ICE Brent is turning higher from channel support and is
likely to challenge $82.94, with $89.58 targeted after this,”
the analysts said. “On pullbacks, it is important to see if
support at $71 can hold.”
