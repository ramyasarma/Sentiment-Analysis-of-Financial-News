             South African money-market futures,
used to gauge interest-rate expectations, slumped to the lowest-
ever level and bonds gained as speculation increased the central
bank will lower its main rate to boost the economy.  
 Forward-rate agreements showed that contracts for  three-
month cash due in three months  fell as much as 3 basis points
from yesterday to 6.27 percent, the lowest since the central
bank first introduced its repurchase rate in 1999, before
trading at 6.29 percent by 4:09 p.m. in Johannesburg. South
Africa’s benchmark 13.5 percent bond due September 2015 rose for
a sixth day, climbing 12 cents to 124.40 rand and reducing the
yield by almost 3 basis points to 7.68 percent.  
 Analysts are raising bets the Pretoria-based Reserve Bank
will lower its 6.5 percent benchmark rate when it meets on July
22 after Governor  Gill Marcus  said July 7 that Europe’s economic
slowdown will affect South Africa’s economic growth, which is
“hesitant” and “uneven.” Growth “moderated somewhat” in
the second quarter and many South Africans still face hardships,
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said the next day.  
 “Marcus’s comments were fairly dovish and that’s causing
the market to price in the chance of a rate cut,” said  George Glynos , managing director of  Econometrix Treasury Management ,
which advises clients on bond and foreign-exchange transactions
in Johannesburg. “Inflation continues to surprise on the
downside.”  
 Slowing inflation has given the Reserve Bank scope to
reduce its key rate seven times since December 2008 to foster a
recovery after the economy fell into its first recession in 17
years in 2009. Policy makers unexpectedly cut the rate by 50
basis points to 6.5 percent on March 25, the lowest since the
repurchase, or repo, rate was first introduced.  
 Inflation  eased to a four-year low of 4.6 percent in May,
helped by the rand’s 24 percent rally against the dollar since
the start of last year and an improved corn crop that made the
staple food more affordable. The central bank targets an
inflation rate between 3 and 6 percent.  
 The rand strengthened 0.8 percent versus the dollar to
7.5571. Against the euro, the rand gained 0.2 percent to 9.5697.
