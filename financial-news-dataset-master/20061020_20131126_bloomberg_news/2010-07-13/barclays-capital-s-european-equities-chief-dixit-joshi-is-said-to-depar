             Barclays Capital ’s head of equities
for Europe, Middle East and Africa,  Dixit Joshi , has left the
bank, two people with knowledge of his decision said.  
 It isn’t clear where he will move to, said the people, who
declined to be identified because his departure hasn’t been made
public. He wasn’t immediately reachable on his office telephone.
A Barclays Capital spokesman declined to comment.  
 Joshi oversaw Barclays’ resumption of European stock
trading last year, as the London-based bank returned to a
business it abandoned in 1997 when it sold Barclays de Zoete
Wedd’s money-losing European equities and corporate finance
unit. Barclays acquired Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s North
American operationsD7EW21GPZEBU"></a>The Financial Times reported Joshi’s exit earlier today.
