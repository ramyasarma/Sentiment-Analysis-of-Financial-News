             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros may rise today, according to Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
may increase to 0.768 percent, said Orlando Green, an interest-
rates strategist in London. The rate was 0.766 percent
yesterday, data from the British Bankers’ Association showed.  
 Libor for three-month dollars may be little changed at
0.525 percent, Green said. The rate was 0.526 percent on July
12.  
 The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for three-
month loans may rise to 0.832 percent, he said. The rate was
0.827 percent yesterday, according to the European Banking
Federation.
