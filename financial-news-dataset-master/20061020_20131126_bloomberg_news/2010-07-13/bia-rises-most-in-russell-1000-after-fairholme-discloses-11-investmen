             MBIA Inc. , owner of the largest bond
insurer, rose the most in the Russell 1000 index after  Fairholme
Capital Management LLC  disclosed an 11 percent passive stake in
the company.  
 Separately,  William C. Fallon  was named interim chief
executive officer of National Public Finance Guarantee, the
company’s municipal-bond insurance unit, succeeding  Thomas G. McLoughlin , who is resigning to go to UBS Financial Services,
MBIA said today in a statement distributed by Business Wire.
Fallon is president and chief operating officer of Armonk, New
York-based MBIA.  
 MBIA jumped 74 cents, or  12 percent , to $7.17 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest increase since
March 24 and the largest percentage gain in the  Russell 1000 .
The shares have risen 80 percent this year.  
 The  stock  traded as high as $73.31 in December 2006 before
plunging as low as $2.29 in March 2009 amid losses on the
company’s mortgage-debt guarantees.  
 Fairholme , the Miami-based investment firm run by  Bruce Berkowitz , reported its MBIA investment yesterday in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Berkowitz is
the second-biggest holder of MBIA stock after Warburg Pincus
LLC, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Berkowitz was
named the U.S. domestic stock fund manager of the decade in
January by Chicago-based Morningstar Inc.
