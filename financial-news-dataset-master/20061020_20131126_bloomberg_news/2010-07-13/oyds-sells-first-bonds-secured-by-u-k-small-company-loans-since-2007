             Lloyds Banking Group Plc  sold 546
million pounds ($828 million) of top-rated bonds secured by
loans to small and medium-sized U.K. companies in the first deal
of its kind since the start of the credit crisis.  
 Lloyds priced 350 million pounds of three-year notes to
yield 195 basis points more than interbank rates, according to
 Sara Evans,  a London-based spokeswoman at Lloyds. A 235 million-
euro ($299 million) tranche was priced at 185 basis points. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Lloyds is the first U.K. bank selling bonds backed by
smaller company loans since Barclays Bank Plc issued 3.5 billion
pounds of the notes in January 2007 through Lambda Finance BV,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. data. The market for asset-
backed debt virtually shut after the U.S. subprime real-estate
crisis caused values of hard-to-value assets to plunge.  
 The notes were issued through special purpose company
Sandown Gold U.K. Cash SME CLO and “sold to a small number of
investors in the U.K. and Europe,” Evans said in a statement.  
 Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets managed the transaction.
