               Minara Resources Ltd ., Australia’s
second-largest nickel producer, reported second-quarter
production dropped 15 percent after a pipeline failure at the
Murrin Murrin plant in  Western Australia .  
 Output of the stainless steel ingredient was 6,680 metric
tons in the three months to June 30, compared with 7,842 tons a
year earlier, Perth-based Minara said today in statement.  
 First-half costs gained 15 percent because of the pipeline
failure, which has been repaired, the company said. Nickel
prices in  London  averaged $22,382 a ton in the quarter, compared
with $12,992 a year earlier.  
 “The negative impact of the pipeline incident on
production has been reflected in an increase to our unit cost of
production,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Johnston said in the
the statement. “We anticipate the nickel price to remain
volatile in the short to medium term.”  
 Minara rose 1.4 percent to 73 cents at 10:19 a.m. Sydney
time on the Australian stock exchange.  
 Glencore International AG, the world’s largest commodity
trader, owns 40 percent of Murrin Murrin and 70.63 percent of
Minara.  
 Forecast full-year production remains unchanged at the
lower end of the 30,000 ton to 34,000 ton range, the company
said. Cobalt output for the quarter was 459 tons from 634 tons a
year earlier, it said.
