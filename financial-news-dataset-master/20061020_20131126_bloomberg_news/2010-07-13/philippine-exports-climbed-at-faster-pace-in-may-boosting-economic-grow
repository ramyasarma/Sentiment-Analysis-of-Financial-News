             Philippine  exports  rose at a faster
pace in May as the global recovery spurred demand for
electronics, sustaining the nation’s economic expansion and
supporting President  Benigno Aquino ’s efforts to boost incomes.  
 Shipments abroad  increased 37.3 percent from a year earlier
to $4.24 billion after climbing a revised 28.2 percent in April,
the National Statistics Office said in Manila today. That
compares with the median forecast for a 25.5 percent gain in a
 Bloomberg News survey  of 10 economists.  
 Asian exports rebounded this year as customers in the U.S.
and Europe increased purchases of Philippine-made Texas
Instruments Inc. semiconductors and South Korea-produced Hyundai
Motor Co. cars. Still, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas may keep its
 benchmark interest rate  at a record-low 4 percent this week to
support the nation’s recovery as the European debt crisis
threatens global growth, economists surveyed by Bloomberg say.  
 “Rising exports would mean more jobs for Filipinos and may
spur investments,”  April Tan , head of research at
CitisecOnline.com Inc. in Manila, said before the report. “If
the global economy is cooperative, it will make it easier for
the president to meet his objectives of increasing growth and
cutting poverty.”  
 The International Monetary Fund raised its 2010 growth
forecast for Asia last week, predicting the region will lead the
recovery from last year’s global slump. Aquino, who took his
oath last month, has pledged to boost incomes and create jobs in
a nation where the World Bank estimates one in four people live
on less than $1.25 a day.  
 Investments Climb  
 Investments in the Philippine electronics industry jumped
more than 10 times to $437 million in the first five months of
the year from the same period in 2009, Semiconductor and
Electronics Industries of the Philippines Inc. President  Ernesto Santiago  said today. Investments may double to $1 billion in
2010 from $467 million last year, even as demand for electronics
may ease starting in the third quarter, he said.  
 Worldwide semiconductor sales jumped 48 percent in May from
a year earlier, according to the Semiconductor Industry
Association.  Electronics sales , which make up more than half of
Philippine exports, rose 41 percent to $2.55 billion in May from
a year earlier, today’s report showed.  
 Exports account for about a third of the Philippines’ $167
billion economy. South Korea’s  exports  rose 32.4 percent in June
from a year earlier, and Malaysia’s overseas sales rose 21.9
percent in May.
