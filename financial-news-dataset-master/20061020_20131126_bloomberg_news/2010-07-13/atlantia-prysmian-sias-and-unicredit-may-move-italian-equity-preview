             Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB  Index
rose 333.93, or 1.6 percent, to 20,851.85, the highest in two
months, in Milan.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  
 ERG SpA  (ERG IM) rose 43 cents, or 4.3 percent, to 10.36
euros, a second day of gains. The refiner may exercise a put
option on the Priolo refinery in Italy that involves Russia’s
OAO Lukoil, Chief Executive Officer  Alessandro Garrone  told Il
Sole 24 Ore in an interview.  
 ERG in 2008 agreed to sell Lukoil 49 percent of a new
company that would control the refinery on the island of Sicily.
ERG’s option, which would force Lukoil to purchase its stake, is
valid until 2014.

euros, a sixth consecutive increase. Intermonte Sim SpA
reiterated an “outperform” rating on the Italian carmaker and
said it expects the company to give more details about its
planned spinoff when it releases second-quarter results July 21.

forecast for the year as demand for models such as the new 5-
Series sedan increased.

10 cents, or 5.2 percent, to 2.02 euros.

percent, to 9.02 euros, erasing yesterday’s loss. Mediobanca

in a note it would consider a potential spinoff of the company’s
real estate assets as positive.  
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM) increased 5.25 cents, or 2.2
percent, to 2.49 euros, the highest since May 3. Banking stocks
rose across Europe after Greece sold 1.63 billion euros ($2.05
billion) of 26-week Treasury bills at a yield of 4.65 percent.
That’s below the 5 percent charged by the European Union for its
bailout package.  
 Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA  (UBI IM) rose 15 cents, or
1.9 percent, to 8.12 euros. Italian banks have “no urgency for
