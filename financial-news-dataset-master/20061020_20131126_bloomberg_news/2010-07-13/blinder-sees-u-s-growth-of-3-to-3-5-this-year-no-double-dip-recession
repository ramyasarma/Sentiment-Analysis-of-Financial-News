             Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman
 Alan Blinder  said the U.S. economy will probably grow 3 percent
to 3.5 percent this year, less than his forecast in December for
as much as 4 percent growth.  
 “The data over the last couple of months have given
pause,” Blinder, a Princeton University economist, said in an
interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart.” “I
still doubt we will have a double dip” recession.  
 In a December 2009 commentary in The Wall Street Journal,
Blinder predicted the U.S. economy will expand 3 percent to 4
percent this year. The economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate
in the first quarter and will expand 3.1 percent for the year,
according to the median forecast among 54 economists surveyed
this month by Bloomberg News.
