             Rubber tumbled for a third day to
the lowest level in more than a month on concern that slower car
sales growth in China may signal weaker demand, while supplies
from Thailand increased.  
 Futures in Tokyo declined as much as 2.2 percent to the
lowest level since June 10. The price dropped 5.9 percent in the
past three sessions after data showed car sales growth in China
slowed, raising concern that consumption may weaken in the
largest consumer of the commodity used to make tires.  
 “The market was following yesterday’s sentiment, pressured
by slow car sales growth in China,” Kazunori Kokubo, general
manager of the international business department at commodity
broker Yutaka Shoji Co., said by phone from Tokyo.  
 Sales of cars, sport-utility vehicles and multipurpose
vehicles in China, the largest auto market, expanded 19 percent
from a year earlier to 1.04 million units last month, the  China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers  said on July 9. That was
the slowest pace since March 2009.  
 December-delivery rubber lost as much as 5.9 yen to 259.6
yen per kilogram ($2,925 a metric ton) before settling at 260.1
yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange.  
 November-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost 2.8 percent to 21,195 yuan ($3,128) a ton.  
 Car Sales  
 China’s passenger-car sales have risen every month since
February 2009 after the government halved the consumption tax on
small vehicles to 5 percent in the preceding month as part of a
stimulus package. Vehicle demand surged 46 percent to 13.6
million units last year, surpassing the  U.S.  for the first time.  
 The small-car sales tax was raised to 7.5 percent this year,
and June was the third straight month of slowing demand. Monthly
sales may decline from year-earlier levels during the second
half of 2010, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts  Adrian Chan  and
 Hung Bin Toh  wrote in a report on May 26.  
 “Improved supply from southern Thailand, amid an absence
of orders from China, also damped market sentiment,” said
 Chaiwat Muenmee , an analyst at Bangkok-based commodity broker DS
Futures Co. An average of 300 tons a day of ribbed smoked sheet
was traded in Thailand’s southern markets this month, compared
with more than 100 tons a day last month, Chaiwat said.  
 In the cash market, the Thai benchmark price dropped 0.4
percent to 112.35 baht ($3.47) per kilogram yesterday, according
to the  Rubber Institute of Thailand .  
 China’s natural-rubber inventories rose 3,429 tons to
19,411 tons, the bourse said on July 9, based on a weekly survey
of 10 warehouses. It was the second straight increase after
reaching the lowest level since January 2003.
