             Cocoa climbed in New York to the
highest price in more than a week as a jump in profit for
aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. revived optimism that an improving
economy will boost demand for commodities. Coffee also gained.  
 Alcoa  yesterday reported second-quarter sales and profit
that beat analysts’ estimates, and the New York-based company
forecast higher global demand for the metal. Stocks rallied, and
the  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials rose.  
 Cocoa prices “are primarily moving off of the market-based
embracement of risk,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market
strategist at broker Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “Economically-
sensitive commodities are catching a nice rally.”  
 Cocoa for September delivery rose $56, or 1.9 percent, to
$3,045 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since July 1. Earlier, the
chocolate ingredient reached $3,052, the highest price since
July 1.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, cocoa futures for September
delivery rose 11 pounds, or 0.5 percent, to 2,397 pounds
($3,633) a metric ton, the biggest gain since July 5.  
 In the week ended July 6, hedge-fund managers and other
large speculators in New York cocoa futures increased their net-
long positions, or bets that prices will rise, to the highest
level in a month, government data show.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery rose 2.1
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $1.6565 a pound in New York. The price
has climbed 22 percent this year.  
 Coffee production in Brazil’s Minas Gerais state, the
world’s biggest-growing region, will climb less than estimated
this year after rain hurt flowering, said Marcelo Moura Almeida,
the chief agronomist at Cooparaiso, a grower’s group that
accounts for 9 percent of arabica coffee output in the country.  
 Production in Minas Gerais will rise 20 percent this year
to 23.9 million bags, each weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds),
according to the government’s May 5 estimate. Almeida didn’t
give an estimate for the state’s output.  
 On the Liffe in London, robusta-coffee futures for
September delivery climbed $16, or 0.9 percent, to $1,721 a
metric ton. The price jumped 33 percent this year.
