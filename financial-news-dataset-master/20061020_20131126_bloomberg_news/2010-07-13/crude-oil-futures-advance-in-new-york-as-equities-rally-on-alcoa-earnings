             Crude oil advanced to the highest
level in more than two weeks in New York as U.S. equities jumped
after Alcoa Inc.’s earnings topped analysts’ estimates.  
 Oil rose 2.9 percent amid speculation that the report by
Alcoa, the first company in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  to
issue second-quarter results, signaled broader economic growth.
U.S. stocks gained for the sixth straight day. The International
Energy Agency forecast oil demand will grow in 2011.  
 “We’re just tagging along with the equities market after
Alcoa turned out better than expected,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
“The equity rally seems to be giving us some support.”  
 Crude for August delivery gained $2.20 to settle at $77.15
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level
since June 28. Prices have risen 7.2 percent in the past week
and 29 percent in the past year.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 1.5 percent to
1,095.34. The Dow advanced 1.4 percent to 10,363.02.  
 “Crude oil will be attached firmly at the hip to equities
during the earnings season,” said  James Cordier , portfolio
manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa, Florida.  
 Profits for S&P 500 companies are projected to have
increased 34 percent in the second quarter, according to
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Alcoa, the largest
aluminum producer, reported net income of $136 million, or 13
cents a share, exceeding the 11-cent average estimate of 17
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue of $5.19 billion also
exceeded the median analyst estimate of $5.02 billion.  
 Prices were little changed from the settlement after the
American Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S.
crude-oil stockpiles increased 1.74 million barrels to 353.5
million. August oil rose $2.18, or 2.9 percent, to $77.13 a
barrel in electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  
 Oil Demand to Rise  
 Global oil demand will increase 1.6 percent in 2011 to
average 87.8 million barrels a day, the Paris-based IEA said in
its first forecast for next year. It left its estimate for 2010
unchanged with a demand growth rate of 2.1 percent to an average
87.8 million barrels a day in a monthly report released today.  
 Demand growth will slow next year because of increased fuel
efficiency in the industrialized nations of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, the IEA said.  
 The IEA report also stated that OPEC compliance with its
supply constraints slipped in June as higher production from
Nigeria and Saudi Arabia made up for reductions from the United
Arab Emirates, Iran and Venezuela.  
 The 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries bound by quotas boosted output by 40,000 barrels a day
to 26.58 million last month, implying compliance of 59 percent,
down from 60 percent in May.  
 ‘Pushing Up Markets’  
 “There are three things pushing up the oil markets,” said
 Jason Schenker , president of Prestige Economics LLC in Austin,
Texas. “The dollar is down quite sharply, there’s a likely draw
in DOE inventories this week, and the IEA report this morning
forecast global demand growth next year. Even though the growth
is slower, you’re still looking at increased demand.”  
 The dollar weakened against the euro for the first time in
three days, bolstering the appeal of commodities as an
alternative investment. The European currency gained 1 percent
to $1.2725 at 4:31 p.m. in New York.  
 U.S. oil supplies probably fell 1.5 million barrels in the
seven days ended July 9 from 358.2 million in the prior week,
the third consecutive decline, according to the median of 13
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey before an Energy
Department report this week. Inventories probably dropped amid
expectations refiners will boost output and imports will fall.  
 ‘$85 or $90’  
 “U.S. oil inventories are falling,” said  Hannes Loacker ,
an analyst at Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich in Vienna.
“With reduced stockpiles, oil could go to $85 or $90 a
barrel.”  
 The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  
 U.S. gasoline demand rose 2.1 percent from June 30 to July
6, the Tuesday after the July Fourth holiday, from a similar
period last year, according to  MasterCard Inc. ’s SpendingPulse
report today.  
 Gasoline for August delivery gained 5.41 cents, or 2.7
percent, to settle at $2.0821 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
level since June 28.  
 Brent crude for August settlement gained $2.28, or 3.1
percent, to $76.65 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 577,585
contracts as of 3:10 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 563,614
contracts yesterday, 26 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.28 million contracts, the
highest level since June 17.
