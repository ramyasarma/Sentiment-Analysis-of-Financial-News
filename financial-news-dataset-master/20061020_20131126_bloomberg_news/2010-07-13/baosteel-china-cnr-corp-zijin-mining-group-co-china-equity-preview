             China’s stocks  rose, rebounding from
the benchmark index’s biggest drop in two weeks, on speculation
earnings will withstand a slowing economy.  
 Jiangling Motors Corp.  jumped 5.2 percent after saying
first-half net income increased and Beiqi Foton Motor Co.
climbed 2 percent on higher vehicle sales. Railcar maker  China
CNR Corp.  rallied after winning new orders. Jiangxi Copper Co.
gained 3.1 percent as commodity prices advanced. Stocks also
rose as Intel Corp. reported record second-quarter sales and
Singapore raised its 2010 economic growth forecast.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 20.16, or 0.8 percent, to
2,470.44 at the close. The  CSI 300 Index  rose 0.7 percent to
2,653.61.  
 “The market had already priced in the most pessimistic
scenario for earnings,” said  Dai Ming , a fund manager at
Shanghai Kingsun Investment Management & Consulting Co. “When
there’s some positive news out there, it’s easy to trigger a
rebound and prompt a re-rating of the market among investors.”  
 The Shanghai Composite has slumped 25 percent in 2010,
making it Asia’s worst performer, on concern government efforts
to curb inflation and property speculation will slow the
economy. The stock gauge fell 1.6 percent yesterday after the
housing ministry reiterated that it will maintain curbs on
speculative purchases and increase market supply, while the
banking regulator said it has made no changes to policies on
home loans.  
 Economic Data  
 A government report tomorrow is likely to show gross
domestic product rose 10.5 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 28 economists, down from the first quarter’s 11.9
percent pace. Industrial production and urban fixed-asset
investment are also estimated to have slowed.  
 Jiangling Motors, the Chinese commercial vehicle partner
with Ford Motor Co., climbed 5.2 percent to 21.81 yuan, the
biggest gain since April 30. The company said first-half profit
more than doubled from a year earlier to 1.04 billion yuan
($153.6 million) on a 66 percent increase in car sales.  
 Beiqi Foton,  China’s biggest commercial-vehicle maker,
added 2 percent to 18.09 yuan after saying first-half vehicle
sales increased 29.4 percent from a year earlier.  
 China CNR gained 3.1 percent to 5.26 yuan. China CNR said
its units won contracts worth a combined 10.78 billion yuan,
accounting for 27 percent of the company’s total sales in 2009.
 China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corp.  rose 4.6 percent to
5.29 yuan. Argentina and China agreed to rail contracts totaling
$10 billion, Agence Presse-France reported yesterday, citing
Argentine Transport Minister Juan Pablo.  
 Singapore, Intel  
 Singapore said its economy will grow between 13 percent and
15 percent this year, adding to optimism in the world’s recovery
after Greece sold bonds at a rate below what the country pays
for European aid. Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, said
third-quarter sales will be $11.6 billion, exceeding analyst
estimates of $10.9 billion in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “Robust earnings from big global companies will ease
concerns about a possible slump in export growth,” said  Wei Wei , an analyst at West China Securities Co. in Shanghai.
“We’ll probably see fairly healthy export growth in the coming
months.”  
 Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, rose
3.1 percent to 25.28 yuan.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the
listed unit of nation’s biggest maker of the lightweight metal

percent in New York while crude oil for August delivery advanced
2.9 percent to the highest level in more than two weeks.  
 Airlines rose as Xinhua News Agency reported passenger
numbers in the first half of this year climbed by more than 17%
from a year earlier. The report cited  Li Jiaxiang , director of
the General Civil Aviation Administration of China.  
 Air China Ltd. , the nation’s largest international carrier,
added 1.3 percent to 11.10 yuan. China Eastern Airlines Corp.,
the nation’s second-largest carrier, advanced 2.1 percent to
6.92 yuan.  
 Separately,  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  may overtake
local rival Bank of China Ltd. on its trading debut tomorrow to
become the world’s seventh-largest lender by market value,
according to analysts and investors.  
 Shares in China’s largest bank by customers will likely
gain 6 percent on their first day in Shanghai, the average
estimate of eight analysts and fund managers surveyed by
Bloomberg shows. Agricultural Bank sold shares in China at 2.68
yuan each as part of an initial public offering that valued the
company at $126 billion. Bank of China added 0.6 percent to 3.53
