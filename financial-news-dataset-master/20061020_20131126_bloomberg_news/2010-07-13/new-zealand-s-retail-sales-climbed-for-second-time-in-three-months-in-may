             New Zealand’s  retail sales  rose for
the second time in three months in May, adding to the case for
the central bank to raise interest rates again.  
 Sales  increased 0.4 percent from April, when they fell a
revised 0.3 percent, seasonally adjusted, Statistics New Zealand
said in Wellington today. The median forecast in a  Bloomberg 
News survey of 15 economists was for a 0.5 percent gain.
