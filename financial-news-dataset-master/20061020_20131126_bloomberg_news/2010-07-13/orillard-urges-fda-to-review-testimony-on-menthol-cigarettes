             Lorillard Inc. , the largest U.S.
maker of menthol cigarettes, is urging regulators to review
testimony by some government scientists indicating the mint
flavor makes cigarettes more harmful.  
 The Food and Drug Administration began examining the health
impact of menthol in cigarettes in March, and a new round of
hearings on the matter begins this week.  
 “We are looking for accuracy along the way,” William
True, Lorillard’s senior vice president of research and
development, said yesterday in an interview. “There will be
much more this week in terms of quantifiable, measurable
science.”  
 Newport, the top-selling menthol cigarette brand in the
U.S., accounted for about 92 percent of Lorillard’s more than $5
billion in  sales  last year. The FDA is reviewing the health
risks of menthol in cigarettes and has until March 2012 to
decide whether to ban them.  
 True, 48, is among executives from Lorillard and larger
rivals  Altria Group Inc.  and Reynolds American Inc. scheduled to
testify at the hearings in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  
 Leonard Jones, Lorillard’s director of direct marketing and
marketing research, will testify after the panel asked tobacco
companies in March to provide data on how they make and market
menthol cigarettes.  
 ‘Cherry-Picking’  
 Some of the FDA’s staff testimony in March consisted of
“cherry-picking” of scientific research pointing to possibly
greater health risks from menthol, Greensboro, North Carolina-
based Lorillard said in a 34-page brief submitted to the
advisory panel June 29. “The best available science does not
support an assertion that menthol in cigarettes impacts public
health,” the company said.  
 “The fact that, in several instances, the information and
conclusions presented were incomplete and/or inaccurate has
tainted the process and the committee,” True said in an
accompanying letter to  Lawrence Deyton , director of the FDA’s
Center for Tobacco Products. Lorillard provided a copy of the
letter to Bloomberg News.  
 Kathleen Quinn , a spokeswoman for the FDA, declined to
comment on True’s remarks.  
 A law signed by President  Barack Obama  in June 2009 gave
the FDA unprecedented power to restrict the marketing of tobacco
products to youths and banned companies from adding flavors such
as clove or strawberry to cigarettes.  
 The law allowed menthol-flavored cigarettes, the most
popular flavor, to stay on the market unless the FDA determines
they’re more of a health risk than regular cigarettes.  
 Lorillard fell 2 cents to $74.65 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have declined 7
percent this year.
