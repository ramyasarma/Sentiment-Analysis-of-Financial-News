             The yen fell to the lowest level in
more than three weeks versus the euro as demand for riskier
asset rose on speculation U.S. corporate earnings will beat
analysts’ estimates.  
 Japan’s currency was at 112.97 per euro as of 7:41 a.m. in
Tokyo, the weakest since June 21, from 112.90 in New York
yesterday. The yen was at 88.78 per dollar from 88.74 yesterday.
