             Symphony Services Corp. , a supplier
of software to companies including  Oracle Corp.  and Airbus SAS,
plans to increase its workers in China fivefold as a global
recovery brings more customers.  
 The software maker backed by TH Lee Putnam Ventures plans
to raise the number of engineers at its Shanghai development
center to 250 next year from the current 50, Chief Operating
Officer Amitava Roy said in an interview in Bangalore. Symphony,
based in Palo Alto, will also add 500 developers in India this
year, taking its count in Bangalore to 4,000, he said.  
 “The overall outlook has been improving in the last two
quarters,” Roy said. “Sales cycles have improved. Some of them
are smaller customers as that’s where the purse strings are
opening up.”  
 Global technology spending is set to rise 3.8 percent this
year after dropping 4.2 percent in 2009, according to market
researcher  IDC , buoying prospects for Symphony and the  industry 
that struggled through the global recession. Sales in emerging
markets including China and India may account for 11 percent of
the spending, helping counter a weakness in Europe because of
the sovereign debt crisis, IDC said.  
 Infosys Technologies Ltd. , India’s biggest software-service
provider by market value, today raised its sales forecast by 2.5
percent to as much as $5.81 billion for the year ending March 31.  
 Symphony has seen “strong growth” in software written for
telephone chips and applications used by companies, Roy said.  
 “Pricing pressures are easing now,” he said. “We added
11 customers in the second quarter.”  
 The U.S. accounts for 70 percent of Symphony’s revenue,
followed by Europe with 20 percent, Roy said.  
 The software developer is seeking to set up a center in
Europe and wants to acquire a company for between $20 million
and $50 million to help achieve its aim of more than doubling
its revenue to $500 million by 2014 from about $200 million now,
he said.
