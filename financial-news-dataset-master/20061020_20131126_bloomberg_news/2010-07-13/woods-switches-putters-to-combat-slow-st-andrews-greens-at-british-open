             Tiger Woods  is switching putters
this week at golf’s British Open in an effort to conquer the
slower greens at St. Andrews.  
 Woods will use a Nike putter at the Old Course, adding it
to the company’s woods and irons already in his bag. He’s used a
Titleist Scotty Cameron putter in winning 13 major titles since
1999.  
 “It’s one of those things where I’ve struggled on slower
greens,” Woods, who won the last two Opens played at St.
Andrews in 2000 and 2005, said at a news conference there today.
“This putter does come off faster with the new groove
technology. I haven’t had to make that much of an adjustment
because the ball is coming off a little bit quicker.”  
 Woods said the greens were under 10 today on the
Stimpmeter, a device that measures the speed of the surface. He
prefers them to be at about 14, similar to those on the U.S. PGA
Tour.  
 The 14-time major winner said he’s spoken many times with
caddie Steve Williams about what he can do to combat slower
greens.  
 “I’ve always experimented with other putters throughout
the years, but I’ve never put one in play until now,” he said,
without saying if the switch was permanent.  
 Woods signed with Beaverton, Oregon-based  Nike Inc.  after
turning pro in 1996.  
 The Open starts in two days and ends July 18. Woods said he
expects a warm reception from the fans as he makes his first
appearance in Britain since admitting marital infidelity. He’s
yet to win since returning to golf in April.  
 “The Scottish fans have always been fantastic with respect
to golf and all the players,” he said. “I wouldn’t see
anything different than what they’ve been over the years.”
