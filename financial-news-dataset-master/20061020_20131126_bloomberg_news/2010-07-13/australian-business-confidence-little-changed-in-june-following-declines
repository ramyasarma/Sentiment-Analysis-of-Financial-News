             Australian business confidence was
little changed in June after falling the previous three months,
as retail and wholesale companies reported improved sentiment.  
 The confidence index dropped 1 point from May to 4,
according to a National Australia Bank Ltd. survey of more than
500 companies between June 24 and June 30, and released in
Sydney today.  
 Last month’s report showed mining companies reported a drop
in sentiment, which may rebound in coming months after new Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  this month agreed with companies
including BHP Billiton Ltd. on a new industry tax, scrapping an
earlier proposal that cost her predecessor  Kevin Rudd  his job.
Today’s report suggests consumers are weathering higher
borrowing costs and turmoil on global financial markets.  
 “Financial markets remained choppy during the survey
period as in May, with ongoing concerns about European sovereign
debt and the global outlook,” said  Alan Oster , chief economist
at National Australia in Melbourne.  
 Central bank Governor  Glenn Stevens , citing concerns about
Europe’s debt turmoil, held the benchmark lending rate unchanged
this month for a second straight meeting after boosting it by
150 basis points between early October and May.  
 National Australia’s business conditions gauge, a measure
of hiring, sales and profits, rose 2 points to 8.  
 “Retail conditions bounced back from their very low levels
in May, but remain in negative territory,” Oster said.
