             Colombia’s peso rose to a nine-month
high on bets dollar flows into the South American country will
increase after the government yesterday sold $500 million worth
of debt in international markets and as oil prices rise.  
 The peso advanced 0.3 percent to 1,872.65 per U.S. dollar
at 3:50 p.m. New York time, from 1,877.9 yesterday. That’s the
strongest level since Oct. 19. The peso has jumped 9.1 percent
this year, the best performance among all currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  
 “Dollars continue to flow into Colombia,” said  Alexander Cardenas , head of research at brokerage Acciones y Valores SA in
Bogota. “Besides the government repatriating funds, companies
are bringing in dollars from sales abroad, including oil.”  
 Colombia sold $500 million worth of bonds yesterday,
completing its plan to sell an additional $500 million in
overseas debt to replace revenue from the scrapped sale of power
company Isagen SA. The securities, known as Global TES, are
denominated in pesos and payable in dollars.  
 Oil, Colombia’s biggest export, jumped as much as 3.2
percent today.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 was little changed at 7.6 percent, according to Colombia’s
stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.035 centavo to 123.306
centavos per peso.
