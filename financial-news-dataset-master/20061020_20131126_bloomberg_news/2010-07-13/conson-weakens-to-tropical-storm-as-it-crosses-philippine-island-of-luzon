             Typhoon Conson weakened to a
tropical storm as it went ashore on the Philippine island of
Luzon, according to the  Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical &
Astronomical Services Administration .  
 The storm, also called Basyang by the Philippine agency,
was located about 129 kilometers (80 miles) east of Manila, the
nation’s capital, with top winds of about 111 kilometers per
hour, the U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported.  
 It lost power after touching land late yesterday and
encountering heavy vertical wind shear, the typhoon center said.
Conson made landfall near the town of Infanta and was expected
to cross the island, according to an update from the Philippine
agency at 11 p.m. Manila time yesterday.  
 The Philippines weather agency  issued  a warning for
flashfloods and landslides, forecasting winds as strong as 100
kph for Manila, Bataan and other cities on Luzon.  
 Three typhoons left about 1,000 people dead in the
Philippines last year and 1.7 million needing aid, according to
the United Nations. The storms destroyed more than 40,000
houses, mostly in Luzon.  
 Conson is the name of a picturesque mountain region in
Vietnam, according to the website of the Hong Kong Observatory,
which lists  names  assigned to cyclones in the Pacific.
