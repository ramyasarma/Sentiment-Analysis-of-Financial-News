             The United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change may supply no Certified
Emission Reduction credits for the rest of the month as it
adopts new procedures.  
 “We expect issuance to return to the usual level of
fluctuation by the end of July,” said UNFCCC spokesman David
Abbass in a telephone interview today. The new procedures are
expected to  boost the supply  of credits starting in August,
he said.  
 The Bonn, Germany-based secretariat and the UN’s Clean
Development Mechanism Executive Board introduced new rules
to speed registration of projects that get emission credits and
ease approvals. Each batch of credits issued for registered
projects must pass through a separate regulatory process. The
CDM is the world’s second biggest carbon market after the
European Union program.  
 No CERs were issued since June 29, according to  UN data 
compiled by Bloomberg. A total of 3.4 million metric tons were
issued in June, down from 20.4 million tons in June 2009.  
 The UNFCCC has issued 421 million tons of CER credits
since October 2005. They would be valued at 5 billion euros
($6.3 billion) based on today’s benchmark price of 11.85 euros a
ton on the European Climate Exchange in London as of 12:16 p.m.
They are up 1.3 percent today and 7.9 percent this year.  
 The premium of December CERs over the same-month contract
for 2012 rose 2 cents, or 5.4 percent, to 39 euro cents a ton on
the ECX. That’s the widest spread since June 11.  
 The regulator is seeking to clear a backlog that surged
to 360 cases by March from 170 in 2008, the board said in a plan
published May 28. Credits from the CDM can be used in the
European market. The UN program governs projects in developing
nations such as industrial-gas-destruction plants and windfarms
that generate tradable offsets.  
 There are 227 projects requesting issuance that are
“awaiting scheduling,” according to the UNFCCC website. The
UNFCCC expects to do “completeness checks” on six requests for
credits today, the site shows.
