             Renova Energia SA , a Brazilian
developer of wind and hydroelectric power, fell in its first day
trading in Sao Paulo after saying last week it’s raising 172.5
million reais ($98 million) in a scaled-back initial public
offering.  
 The units dropped 1.7 percent to 14.75 reais at 9:24 a.m.
New York time.  
 Renova said in a July 8 regulatory filing it was selling 10
million units, each consisting of one common share and two
preferred shares, plus two possible supplementary offerings, for
15 reais each. The company is raising a fifth of what it had
initially sought before shelving its IPO in March. Renova, based
in Sao Paulo, said March 1 it planned to raise as much as 868
million reais.
