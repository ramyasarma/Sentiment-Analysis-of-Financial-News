             Apple Inc.  declined a day after
Consumer Reports said it wouldn’t recommend the iPhone 4,
fueling concern that demand for the smartphone may drop and
speculation that the handset may be recalled.  
 Apple fell $5.49, or 2.1 percent, to $251.80 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock, up 19
percent  this year , has dropped 7.1 percent since June 23, the
day before the iPhone 4 was released.  
 Consumer Reports  said it wouldn’t recommend the latest
version of the iPhone after tests confirmed that the device has
a hardware flaw that can diminish signal strength if held in a
certain way. The report is spurring speculation of an Apple
recall, said  Vijay Rakesh , an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach
Inc. in Chicago.  
 “This is not like a BP or Toyota situation where the
measures are much more drastic,” said Rakesh, who  recommends 
buying Apple shares. He said incidents of iPhone 4 antenna
problems aren’t widespread, and checks with retail outlets
indicate demand for the phone is strong.  
 Toyota Motor Corp. is working to restore consumer
confidence after recalling more than 8 million vehicles for
defects linked to unintended acceleration.  
 Rakesh said an Apple recall would cost less than $100
million.  Toni Sacconaghi , an analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co.
in New York, put the price tag at $1.5 billion, though he called
such an outcome “highly unlikely.” Issuing rubber cases to cover
the phone’s trouble spot in the bottom-left corner would cost
Apple $1 per unit, he said today in a report.  
 Corporate Image  
 “Apple’s image -- and potentially iPhone sales -- could be
compromised if Apple does not explicitly -- and constructively
-- address the issue of what it believes is wrong with the phone
and how it will address it,” said Sacconaghi, who rates Apple
“outperform.”  
 Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. in
Minneapolis, said the problem may be periodically affecting 25
percent of iPhone 4 owners. The issue is being “overblown” and
Apple could give away cases to allay customer concerns, he said.
Munster also said a recall is “highly unlikely.”  
 An Apple representative didn’t respond to a request for
comment.  Apple  has suggested users hold the phone in a way that
doesn’t cover the lower-left corner or use a case. The company
also said the problem could be related to faulty software that
overstates signal strength on the phone. Apple said it will be
changing the formula for calculating how many reception bars to
display.  
 Consumer Reports  said its findings “call into question”
Apple’s claim that the problem is an “optical illusion.” A
solution recommended by Consumer Reports is to place a piece of
duct tape over the bottom-left corner of the phone.  
 In an early review, based on a few hours of use, Consumer
Reports had called the device the “ best iPhone yet ” and an
“exception to the rule that successful franchises typically run
out of excitement and creativity after several sequels.”
