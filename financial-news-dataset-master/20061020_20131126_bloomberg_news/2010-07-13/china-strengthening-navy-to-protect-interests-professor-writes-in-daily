             China is strengthening its navy to
protect its “core national interests,” Gong Jianhua, an
associate professor at the Schoool of Politics and Public
Administration at Guangdong Ocean University, wrote in a
commentary published in today’s China Daily newspaper.  
 The Chinese navy isn’t a threat to any country, Gong wrote.
China is developing and modernizing its marine forces as no
other nation in modern times has faced greater threats from the
sea, Gong wrote.  
 History also shows that no country can be a great power
without a strong naval force, Gong wrote.
