             Sugar rose for a second day in New
York and London as Thailand repurchased the sweetener for the
first time in more than 30 years, fueling speculation that
demand will stay strong as buyers add to stockpiles.  
 Thailand bought back 74,350 metric tons of domestic-origin
sugar from traders today to meet local demand. Global
inventories probably will be 33 percent of consumption, equal to
119 days, in the year to Sept. 30, down from 139 days last year
and 170 days the year before, said  Stefan Uhlenbrock , an analyst
at researcher F.O. Licht.  
 “Global stocks have run down to the lowest level in two
decades,” he said in an interview. “This is a major cause for
the firm sugar price.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery climbed as much as 0.16
cent, or 0.9 percent, to 17.26 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York and was at 17.18 cents at 8:45 a.m. local time.  
 White, or refined, sugar for October delivery rose as much
as $9.50, or 1.8 percent, to $528.10 a ton on the Liffe exchange
and was last at $522.70. The August contract is at a premium of
about $89 to October-delivery sugar, a so-called backwardation
that may signal limited supplies.  
 “Thailand’s purchase in tandem with those of Asian
countries has supported prices,” Sudakshina Unnikrishnan, an
analyst with Barclays Capital in London, wrote in an e-mailed
report today. The nation is the world’s second-biggest exporter
of sugar after Brazil.  
 Pakistan, Philippines  
 Some Asian countries must import the sweetener to help meet
local demand and keep prices under check. Pakistan has invited
bids by Aug. 7 to supply 175,000 tons of refined sugar, and the
Philippine government said last week it will purchase 150,000
tons of sweetener after milling was delayed.  
 Cocoa for September delivery rose $37, or 1.2 percent, to
$3,026 a ton in New York. The chocolate ingredient for September
delivery gained 13 pounds, or 0.5 percent, to 2,399 pounds
($3,625) a ton in London, the third increase in a row.  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery advanced 2.75 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $1.663 a pound in New York. Robusta beans for
September delivery climbed $17, or 1 percent, to $1,722 a ton in
London.
