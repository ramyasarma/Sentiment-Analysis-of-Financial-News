             Coal seam gas projects valued at
more than A$35 billion ($31 billion) will be delayed after
Australian Environment Minister Peter Garrett sought more time
to study their potential effects on the environment, the
Australian Financial Review reported. Decisions on projects
proposed by Santos Ltd. and BG Group Plc are not expected before
Oct. 11, according to the report.
