             South Africa’s rand rallied to its
strongest level in more than two weeks against the dollar as the
price of gold rose the most in a month and gains in equities
worldwide boosted investors’ appetite for risk.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest economy appreciated as
much as 1.1 percent to 7.5318 per dollar, the strongest since
June 28, and traded at 7.5378 by 5:44 p.m. Johannesburg, from a
close of 7.6164 yesterday. Against the euro the rand was little
changed at 9.5873.  
 Gold, which along with platinum accounts for about a fifth
of South Africa’s export earnings, rallied on speculation that a
global recovery will boost demand for precious and industrial
metals. U.S. and European stocks climbed for a sixth day as
Alcoa Inc. began the U.S. earnings season with profit that beat
estimates. The earnings helped boost the price of copper futures
in New York.  
 “It’s partly due to gold and other commodities that the
rand is benefitting,”  Nigel Rendell , an emerging-market
strategist at RBC Capital in London. “The fairly positive
equities backdrop also makes people more happy about buying
risk.”
