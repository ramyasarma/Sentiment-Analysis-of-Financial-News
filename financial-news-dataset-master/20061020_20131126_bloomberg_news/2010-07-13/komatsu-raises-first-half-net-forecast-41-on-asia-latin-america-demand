             Komatsu Ltd., the world’s second-
largest maker of construction equipment, raised its first-half
profit forecast by 41 percent on rising demand from Asia and
Latin America.  
 Net income may climb to 52 billion yen ($586 million) in
the six months to Sept. 30, compared with an April 27 estimate
of 37 billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said today in a
statement. Komatsu earned 8.2 billion yen a year earlier.  
 Sales may reach 870 billion yen, beating its forecast by
6.7 percent, the company said. Komatsu is benefitting from
stronger growth in emerging markets including Southeast Asia,
and faster-than-expected demand recovery in the U.S. and Japan.  
 The company also raised its full-year net income forecast
by 17 percent to 105 billion yen, the statement said. It left
its second-half profit outlook unchanged as demand may be offset
by a stronger yen, the statement said.  
 Komatsu  shares  fell 1.6 percent to 1,698 yen in Tokyo
trading. The revision was announced after the stock market
closed in Tokyo.
