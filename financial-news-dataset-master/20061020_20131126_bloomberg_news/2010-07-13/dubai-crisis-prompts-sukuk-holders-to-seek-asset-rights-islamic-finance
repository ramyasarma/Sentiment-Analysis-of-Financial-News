             The Dubai debt crisis is prompting
investors in the $130 billion Islamic bond market to seek
stronger rights of ownership of assets to protect against
defaults, said a U.S.-based Shariah scholar.  
 Funds will favor asset-backed debt, in which the ownership
of collateral is transferred after a default, said  Sheikh Yusuf Talal DeLorenzo , the Washington-based chief Shariah officer at
Shariah Capital Inc., a consulting company. Only 4 percent of
the $32 billion of Islamic bonds Moody’s Investors Service rated
in 2009 contain such provisions, the company said in an April
report. The rest rely on the issuer agreeing to a sell assets
financed by the bonds if they can’t make payments on time.  
 “Clearly, Islamic investors have felt that the present
generation of sukuk has not met expectations for ownership, so
changes are being demanded,” DeLorenzo said in a telephone
interview on July 7. They “will require greater due diligence
with regard to transfer of ownership,” he said.  
 Sales of Islamic bonds have fallen 22 percent this year as
demand waned after Dubai World, one of the United Arab Emirates
three main state-owned business groups, announced plans to
restructure debt in November. Kuwait’s  Investment Dar Co.  was
the first company from the Persian Gulf to default on a $100
million sukuk in April last year.  
 Sales Fall  
 Global sales fell to $6.6 billion in 2010 even as Dubai
World, whose unit Nakheel PJSC is building palm-shaped islands
off Dubai’s coast, said in May its main creditors agreed to
restructure its $23.5 billion of liabilities. Yields on
Nakheel’s 2.75 percent $750 million fixed-rate Islamic notes due
in January 2011 have fallen to 15.14 percent after reaching 140
percent on Dec. 9, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The difference between the  average yield  for emerging-
market sukuk and the London interbank offered rate narrowed 10
basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, in the past week to 421
basis points yesterday, according to the  HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai US
Dollar Sukuk Index . It’s still up from 348 on Nov. 25, when
Dubai World announced its restructuring.  
 The yield gap between the Dubai Department of Finance’s
6.396 percent sukuk maturing in November 2014 and the Malaysian
government’s 3.928 percent Islamic note due June 2015 has
widened 29 basis points since May 28 to 409 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 ‘No Recourse’  
 Bonds in the Islamic finance industry, with $1 trillion of
assets, need to comply with the religion’s ban on interest
payments. Assets such as real estate are typically leased out
and payments to investors are usually in the form of rental
income or profit streams. Issuers set up special-purpose
companies that hold the transferred property and ownership
remains in the hands of the borrower.  
 Investors in most Islamic debt have “no recourse” to the
underlying property and cannot force the company to liquidate if
it defaults,  Khalid Howladar , a Dubai-based senior credit
analyst at Moody’s, said yesterday.  
 “The only way they’ll get their money back following a
default is if the company restructures and pays them back, or
from the proceeds of a liquidation,” he said in an interview.
“Investors in an asset-backed sukuk have a secured legal claim
to the underlying assets and can elect to sell the assets if a
company defaults on its payment.”  
 Debt Defaults  
 Investment Dar, the Kuwait-based company that owns half of
luxury carmaker Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd., said in May 2009 that
it defaulted on $100 million of Islamic bonds maturing in
October 2010. The Musharaka sukuk is based on profit and loss
sharing underpinned by new and used vehicles, according to the
sale prospectus.  
 Dubai World and its seven biggest lenders will present its
restructuring plan to almost 70 creditors on July 22, a person
familiar with the matter said on July 11. Nakheel, which
reorganizing $10.5 billion of liabilities, is holding a separate
meeting with its lenders on July 14, Khaleej Times reported July
6, citing Chairman  Ali Lootah .  
 The quality of the asset that underlies a security is more
important than the debt’s structure,  James Atkinson , a senior
associate at Norton Rose (Asia) LLP in Singapore, said in an
interview in Kuala Lumpur on July 6.  
 “Being a secured creditor doesn’t automatically place you
in a better position than you would be where you only have a
direct contractual claim against an issuer or guarantor,” he
said. “If it’s a low-quality credit, it will provide little in
the way of credit support.”  
 DeLorenzo, who frequently meets with investors, said they
are demanding debt underpinned by more stable and reliable
assets than real estate because they have “taken a beating.”  
 Pledging assets to back Islamic bonds may be a challenge in
some countries,  Mohammed Dawood , director of debt capital
markets at HSBC Holdings Plc, said in an e-mail response on July
11. HSBC is the top underwriter of sukuk so far in 2010.  
 “The legal environment in many countries is not fully
supportive of asset-backed structures,” Dawood said, predicting
they will remain less than 10 percent of total issuance. He said
many corporate and government covenants “prohibit these issuers
from selling or pledging assets as part of any fundraising
exercise.”
