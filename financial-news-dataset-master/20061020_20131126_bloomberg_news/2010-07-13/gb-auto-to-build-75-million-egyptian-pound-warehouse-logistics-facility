             GB Auto S.A.E. , the biggest
independent car maker in the Middle East, said it will build a
75 million Egyptian pound ($13.2 million) automotive warehouse
and logistics facility in Egypt’s Sadat City.  
 GB Auto was awarded the 700,000 square meter plot of land
in a government tender, the Cairo-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. Construction of the facility will start
in three months and the warehouse will become fully operational
within 12 to 18 months, GB Auto said.  
 “This bonded facility will allow us to receive our imports
of containers as well as completely built up vehicles as soon as
they arrive in Egypt’s ports,”  Raouf Ghabbour , GB Auto’s chief
executive officer said in the statement. “At our current rate
of import, the facility will save GB Auto some 30 million pounds
per year.”  
 GB Auto may be able to generate 30 million pounds in
revenue per year by renting out parts of the warehouse to other
car makers, the company said. Sadat City is 90 kilometres north
of Cairo.  
 Shares of GB Auto rose 2.5 percent to 40 Egyptian pounds
yesterday, valuing the company at 5.03 billion Egyptian pounds.
GB Auto shares have gained 58 percent this year.
