             The People’s Bank of China appointed
Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd., a unit of China’s third-largest
lender, to handle yuan transactions for Taiwanese banks through
its Hong Kong unit, according to a  statement  posted on the
central bank’s website today.  
 The arrangement was made under the Cross-Strait Financial
Cooperation Agreement signed in 2009 between the mainland and
Taiwan, the central bank said in a separate statement.  
 “The authorization would help solve problems” in yuan
clearing with Taiwan, including “unstable cash note supply,
damaged notes and high exchanging costs,” according to the PBOC.  
 China needs to conduct overseas yuan clearing through banks
in Hong Kong, where regulations are already in place, because
the mainland hasn’t opened up its capital account yet, China’s
central bank said.  
 Taiwanese lenders previously bought yuan from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Bank of America in Hong Kong,  George Chou , deputy
governor at the island’s central bank, said at a briefing in
Taipei today.  
 “In the future, Bank of China (Hong Kong) will be able to
supply us with new notes at a lower cost and the supply will be
steady,” Chou said, adding that two lenders in Taiwan will be
appointed to handle the yuan settlement with the Hong Kong bank.  
 Bank of Taiwan and Mega International Commercial Bank are
qualified to be settlement banks but they have yet to apply,
Chou said.  
 Some technical support and agreements between commercial
banks involved are needed before Bank of China (HK) officially
starts the business, the PBOC said.
