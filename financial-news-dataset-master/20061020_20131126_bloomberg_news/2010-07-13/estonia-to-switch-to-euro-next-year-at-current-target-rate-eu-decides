             Estonia will switch to the euro at
the current target exchange rate when it enters the monetary
union next year, European finance ministers decided.  
 The kroon will be converted at 15.6466 per euro, the
official target since Estonia joined the European exchange-rate
grid in 2004. The currency has barely strayed from the target,
averaging 15.6453 per euro since then. It last traded at 15.6464
per euro.  
 The decision was made by finance ministers meeting in
Brussels today.  
 Estonia will rank as the euro region’s second-smallest
economy when it makes the currency switch next Jan. 1, with
economic output of 14 billion euros ($17.6 billion). Estonia
pegged the kroon to the deutsche mark when it was created in
1992, transferring that peg to the euro in 1999.
