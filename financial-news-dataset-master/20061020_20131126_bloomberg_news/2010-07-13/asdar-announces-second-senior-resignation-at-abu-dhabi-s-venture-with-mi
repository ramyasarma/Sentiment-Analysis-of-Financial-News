             Masdar Institute of Science and
Technology ’s Provost  John Perkins  resigned after a year in the
post, the second senior departure from Abu Dhabi’s joint project
with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  
 Perkins has decided “to return to the U.K. in the fall for
personal reasons,” Masdar Institute Media Relations Officer
Lesley Snyman said by e-mail today. “The institute will be
announcing a replacement in due course.”  
 Perkins’s resignation follows the departure of head of
research Tariq Ali, a former U.K. government energy adviser and
director of the Energy and Environment Office at London’s
Imperial College. The two most senior employees at the Institute
were appointed in 2009.  
 The government of Abu Dhabi pledged to invest $22 billion
in  Masdar  as it seeks to become an international hub for
renewable energy. Masdar Institute, a graduate-level university
for renewable energy research that opened last September, is
envisioned as the venture’s centerpiece. The curriculum and
programs have been developed with MIT, and the institute expects
its student population to multiply 10-fold to 800 by 2015.  
 Perkins joined Masdar Institute from the  University of
Manchester , where he was Vice-President and Dean of the Faculty
of Engineering and Physical Sciences.
