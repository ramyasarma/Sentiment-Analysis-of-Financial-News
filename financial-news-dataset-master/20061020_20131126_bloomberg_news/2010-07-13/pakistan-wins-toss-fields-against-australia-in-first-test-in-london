             Pakistan won the toss and put
Australia in to bat in the first cricket Test at Lord’s in
London. Play is due to begin at noon local time after the start
was delayed by rain.  
 It’s the first neutral Test at the “home of cricket”
since 1912 and is being held there because of security concerns
over staging matches in Pakistan. The two-match series counts as
a “home” event for Pakistan.  
 Pakistan: Salman Butt, Imran Farhat, Azhar Ali, Umar Amin,
Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi (captain), Kamran Akmal, Mohammad
Aamer, Umar Gul, Mohammad Asif, Danish Kaneria.  
 Australia: Shane Watson, Simon Katich, Ricky Ponting (captain),
Michael Clarke, Michael Hussey, Marcus North, Tim Paine, Steven
Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Ben Hilfenhaus, Doug Bollinger.
