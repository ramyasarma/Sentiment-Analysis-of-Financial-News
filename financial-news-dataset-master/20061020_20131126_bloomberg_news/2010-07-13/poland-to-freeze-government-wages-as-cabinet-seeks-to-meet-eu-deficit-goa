             Poland’s government approved plans
to freeze the average nominal wages of government workers as
part of a draft budget designed to control the deficit.  
 The plan assumes Poland’s economy will grow 3.5 percent
next year and consumer prices will rise 2.3 percent, the
government said today in an e-mailed statement. The figures
suggest revenue may be lower than previously anticipated after
the government in February forecast a 4.5 percent expansion and
2.8 percent increase in consumer prices.  
 Poland pledged to cut its budget deficit to the European
Union limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 after
it swelled to 7.1 percent last year as the global economic
crisis reduced tax revenue. Achieving that goal will require the
government to reduce non-discretionary spending, which accounts
for more than two-thirds of expenditures, analysts say.  
 “The budget assumptions are a touch conservative about
growth for next year,” said Peter Attard Montalto, the London-
based emerging markets economist at Nomura International Plc.
“The interesting news is a nominal freeze on wages, though this
seems to be offset by a rise in the public-sector workforce,
meaning the net impact on the budget will be small.”  
 The budget proposal assumes there will be 560,685 public-
sector workers in 2011.  
 Throughout the economy, wages will rise an average of 3.7
percent in 2011 and employment will increase by 1.9 percent, the
government estimates. The unemployment rate will rise to 9.9
percent at the end of next year, from 8.2 percent in 2008.
