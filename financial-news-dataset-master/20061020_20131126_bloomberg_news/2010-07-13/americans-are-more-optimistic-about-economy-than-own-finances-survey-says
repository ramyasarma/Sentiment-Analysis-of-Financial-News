             More Americans expect the U.S.
economy to improve rather than decline in the next six months,
according to a  survey  by a financial planning group.  
 Forty-four percent of respondents said the economy will get
better compared with 28 percent who believe it will get worse,
said the survey, which was released today by the Washington-
based Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc., an
organization that grants certification to financial advisers.  
 “Americans are generally hopeful, and much of the economic
news leads us to conclude that we are out of the recession and a
double dip is unlikely,” said  Robert Glovsky , chair of the CFP
Board and director of Boston University’s program for financial
planners. “With that said, most Americans have not planned well
for their futures.”  
 The U.S. is struggling to recover from the worst recession
since the 1930s, with 83,000 private jobs added in June.
 Unemployment  was 9.5 percent last month, compared with 9.7
percent in May and confidence among U.S. consumers rose in June
to the highest level in more than two years, another survey
showed. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment increased to 75.5, the highest since
January 2008, from 73.6 in May.  
 The CFP Board survey was conducted by telephone in July
among 1,002 adults age 18 and over by Penn Schoen Berland, a
market research and consulting firm based in Washington. The
margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent.  
 Less Optimistic  
 Americans remain less optimistic about their own finances,
the CFP Board survey said. About 37 percent said they expect
their finances to improve in the next six months and are more
worried about their finances today than they were two years ago,
with 65 percent saying they have financial concerns that are
“much” or “somewhat” greater than they were at the beginning
of the recession.  
 The top three financial issues for respondents were
retirement goals and planning, education funding and savings
targets, the survey said.  
 Eighty percent said they think that Congress and regulators
haven’t done enough to deal with the financial market problems
and their impact on investors. The U.S. Senate is expected to
give final approval this week to legislation overhauling the
financial-services industry.  
 The bill creates a consumer bureau at the Federal Reserve,
a council of regulators to monitor firms for systemic risk to
the economy and a mechanism for liquidating large financial
companies whose collapse would threaten the economy. The House
of Representatives approved the bill on June 30.
