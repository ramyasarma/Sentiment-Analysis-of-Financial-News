             Former Bank of England policy maker
 Sushil Wadhwani  said the transfer of financial system oversight
powers to the central bank is “odd” given that officials
haven’t abandoned policies that fanned the banking crisis.  
 “Little was done to deal with the bubble, despite public
concerns about excessive risk taking, while the response to the
crisis was slow,” he said in “The Future of Finance,” a
collection of essays published today. “Yet, the absence of
contrition from the BOE has been surprising.”  
 Wadhwani’s remarks come as Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
government prepares to hand the central bank authority over
financial regulation in a bid to create a supervisory system
that will be able to spot and prevent another crisis. Wadhwani
served on the  Monetary Policy Committee  from 1999 to 2002.  
 “In my time at the MPC at the bank, I was surprised by the
lack of interest in issues relating to financial markets,” he
said. “Indeed there seemed to be a deliberate policy to run
down resource in the Financial Stability wing. It is therefore
odd that the new regulatory structure makes an unrepentant BOE
even more powerful.”  
 Wadhwani said officials who challenged an assumption of the
efficiency of financial markets found their questions were
“strongly resisted,” and the bank’s financial stability
department was overlooked. In addition, the model the bank
refers to when it sets policy has no explicit role for
bankruptcy and gives little importance to capital requirements.  
 Power Separation  
 He said it may be a mistake to proceed with a regulatory
system that separates the bank’s rate-setting panel from the new
Financial Policy Committee, which will monitor the stability of
the financial system and set bank capital requirements. Tools to
promote price and financial stability must be coordinated to
avoid dislocations, such as asset-price surges that become
destabilizing booms, he said.  
 Andrew Haldane , executive director for financial stability
at the Bank of England, wrote in a separate essay in the book
that gains in financial services productivity since the 1980s
may be a “mirage” rather than a “miracle.” Challenges in
assessing risk or interest flows may mean that the contribution
of banking to gross domestic product can be distorted, he said.  
 The risks that an unchecked financial industry pose to the
rest of the economy support the case for improving measurements
of its value, he said.
