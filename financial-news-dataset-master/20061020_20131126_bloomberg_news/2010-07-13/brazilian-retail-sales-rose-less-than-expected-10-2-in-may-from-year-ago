             Brazil’s  retail sales  rose less that
analysts forecast in May, a sign that consumer demand may be
slowing after the government removed tax breaks designed to spur
spending.  
 Sales climbed 10.2 percent in May from a year ago and 1.4
percent from the previous month, the national statistics agency
said today on its website. Economists had forecast an annual
increase of 10.7 percent and a monthly increase of 1.8 percent,
according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 Retail sales growth has slowed from the first quarter,
partly because the government allowed tax cuts on car purchases
to expire at the end of March, said Jankiel Santos, chief
economist at Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento, speaking by
phone from Sao Paulo.  
 “We are seeing some moderation in terms of retail sales,
especially in the wake of the withdrawal of the tax
incentives,” Santos said. “It’s still a very robust
increase.”  
 Brazil’s economy expanded at the  fastest pace  since 1995 in
the first quarter, led by domestic demand and a record surge in
investment. In March, retail sales rose 15.7 percent from a year
earlier, the most since at least 2001.  
 The central bank raised interest rates twice this year to
10.25 percent from a record low 8.75 percent in March in a bid
to prevent the economy from overheating.  
 Rate Outlook  
 The bank will raise the benchmark Selic rate to 11 percent
at its July 20-21 meeting, and to 12 percent by year end,
according to a July 9 central bank survey of about 100
economists.  
 Brazil’s benchmark inflation rate may stay above the
government’s 4.5 percent midpoint target until the second
quarter of 2012, the central bank said in its quarterly
inflation report June 30.  
 The yield on the interest-rate future contract due in
January 2011, the most traded on the Sao Paulo BM&F futures
exchange today, was unchanged at 11.32 percent at 8:19 a.m. New
York time. The real rose 0.4 percent to 1.7544 per U.S. dollar
from 1.7607 yesterday.
