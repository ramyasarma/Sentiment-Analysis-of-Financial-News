             South Africa’s Olympic body said it
would oversee a bid for the 2020 games and encouraged cities in
the country to state their intention to host the event.  
 South African President  Jacob Zuma  said last week that the
nation might bid to stage the Olympics following its hosting of
the 2010 soccer World Cup, which ended two days ago.  
 The board of the South African Sports Confederation and
Olympic Committee met today to discuss Zuma’s comments, Chief
Executive Officer Tubby Reddy said in a  statement  on the
organization’s website.  
 “Our intention is to provide a world-class city capable of
hosting Africa’s first Olympic Games in 2020,” Reddy said.  
 South Africa was the first country on the continent to host
the World Cup, which attracted about half a million foreign
visitors, according to the Finance Ministry. No African city has
staged the Olympic Games.
