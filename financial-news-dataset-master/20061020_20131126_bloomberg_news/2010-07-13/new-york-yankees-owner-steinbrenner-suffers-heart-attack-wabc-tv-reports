             George Steinbrenner , principal owner
of the New York Yankees, died at the age of 80, his family
confirmed in an e-mailed statement.  
 Television station WABC in New York said he was rushed to a
hospital after suffering a “massive” heart attack.  
 Steinbrenner owned the team while it won seven of the
team’s record 27 World Series titles. He bought the franchise
with a group of investors for $10 million from CBS Corp. in
1973. Though his initial investment was $168,000, Steinbrenner
bought out his partners over the years to become principal
owner. In April, Forbes magazine valued the team at $1.6
billion, most in baseball.  
 His son,  Hal Steinbrenner , was approved by Major League
Baseball owners to become controlling owner in November 2008.
