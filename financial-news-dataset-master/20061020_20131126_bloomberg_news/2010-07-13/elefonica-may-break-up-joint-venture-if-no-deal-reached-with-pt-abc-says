             Telefonica SA will go to a Dutch 
arbitration court to seek the break-up of Brasilcel NV, its 
joint venture with Portugal Telecom SGPS SA that controls 60 
percent of Vivo Participacoes SA, if it can’t reach an 
agreement this week with the Portuguese company to buy its 
stake in the Brazilian wireless operator, ABC reported.  
 Telefonica believes July 16 is the last date by which it 
can reach an accord with Portugal Telecom without seeking to 
disband Brasilcel, the newspaper said, citing people close to 
the phone company’s board it didn’t identify by name. In the 
event that Brasilcel were disbanded, Telefonica would seek to 
buy shares in Vivo in the open market until it reaches majority
control, ABC said.
