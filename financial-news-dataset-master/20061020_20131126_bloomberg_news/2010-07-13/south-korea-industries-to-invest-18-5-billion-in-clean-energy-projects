             South Korea’s 30 major industrial
groups plan to invest 22.4 trillion won ($18.5 billion) by 2013
in clean energy, including batteries and solar power, to benefit
from the government’s spending on environment-friendly projects.  
 The proposed investment from 2011 to 2013 is a 48 percent
increase from 15.1 trillion won over the past three years, the
presidential office said in a statement today.  
 Samsung Group , the nation’s largest group, on May 11
unveiled a 23.3 trillion-won spending plan to expand into five
new areas by 2020, including solar cells and batteries for
electric vehicles.  LG Group  said in April it will invest 20
trillion won by 2020 to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and develop
energy-saving products.  
 The government plans to spend as much as 15 trillion won on
rechargeable battery technology by 2020 to boost competitiveness,
the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said July 11.  
 South Korea, Asia’s fourth-biggest crude oil importer, said
last year it plans to invest 107 trillion won over the next five
years to improve energy efficiency and help cut reliance on
fossil fuels and boost economic growth.
