             Ireland’s government will almost
halve its “World War-type” budget deficit next year as the
cost of bailing out the country’s banks declines, the  Economic &
Social Research Institute  said.  
 The general government deficit will surge to 19.8 percent
of gross domestic product this year, partly as the government
pledges to inject 13 billion euros ($16.5 billion) into two
banks, the Dublin-based institute said in a report published
today. The shortfall, which was 14.6 percent of GDP last year,
would be 11.5 percent of GDP in 2010 excluding the bank costs.  
 “There will be a World War-type of deficit before normal
service resumes next year,” said  Alan Barrett , a research
professor at the ESRI.  
 Ireland’s government may face a total bill of 25 billion
euros to rescue  Anglo Irish Bank Corp.  and Irish Nationwide
Building Society, Central Bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  has
said. That’s increasing pressure on the public finances, which
have already suffered as the recession eroded tax revenue. The
government aims to lower the budget gap to below the European
Union limit of 3 percent of GDP by 2014.  
 The economy is “showing tentative signs of recovery but
remains vulnerable to external risks,” the ESRI said in the
report.  
 Gross domestic product  will grow 2.75 percent in 2011 after
increasing by 0.25 percent this year, the ESRI forecast.
Unemployment will decline to 13 percent from 13.25 percent,
driven mainly by emigration. The economy shrank 7.6 percent last
year and  unemployment  almost doubled, after a real-estate boom
collapsed.
