             China can find a way to resolve a
dispute with Argentina over soybean oil purchases, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs said.  
 The friction over China’s imports of Argentine soybean oil
was “normal” as overall trade between the two countries
expands, spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing today,
without elaborating.  
 China in April told traders to stop buying soybean oil from
the South American nation as it sought to force the country to
scrap anti-dumping duties on Chinese products such as shoes,
textiles and steel products. Last month China ruled out
resumption of the trade after talks between officials failed.  
 President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  is visiting
Beijing with a trade delegation.  
 China, the biggest consumer of vegetable oils, may import
about 200,000 tons of soybean oil each month from July to
September, Grain.gov.cn said in an e-mailed report.  
 The prediction compares with about 40,000 tons of incoming
shipments in June, it said. Brazil is now the largest supplier,
with about 80 percent, while the U.S. ships the rest, and no
shipments are likely from Argentina, it said. Before April,
Argentina was the biggest supplier, customs data show.
