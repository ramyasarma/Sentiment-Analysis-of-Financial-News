             Nakheel PJSC, the property developer
owned by Dubai World, plans to offer lenders interest of 4
percentage points more than benchmark rates as it seeks to
restructure $10.5 billion of debt, according to two bankers with
knowledge of the plan.  
 Nakheel, the state-owned builder of a palm tree-shaped
island development off Dubai’s coast, will offer the new
interest rate on its loans in dollars and dirhams at a meeting
tomorrow, said the bankers, who declined to be identified
because the matter is private. In return, lenders would agree to
extend the lifetime of the loans by five years, the people said.  
 The proposed terms aren’t final, according to one of the
people. The loans make up part of the debt that Nakheel is
seeking to reorganize, which also includes outstanding payments
to suppliers and contractors. The spreads will be over the
Emirates interbank offered rate or the London interbank offered
rate, the bankers said.  
 Spokesmen for Dubai World and the state’s Department of
Finance, which has pledged $8 billion to Nakheel, declined to
comment.  
 Nakheel said March 25 that its secured bank creditors will
receive 100 percent of their principal and accrued interest
under an agreement to extend the maturities of its loans. The
developer has one dollar loan outstanding, a $1.85 billion
facility that was signed in August 2007 and is currently due to
expire in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The borrower said June 30 it had begun settling bills from
its biggest trade creditors, involving a payout of 4 billion
dirhams ($1.1 billion.)  
 Nakheel and parent Dubai World, one of the emirate’s three
main state-owned holding companies, are seeking to renegotiate
terms on their debt after the deepest financial crisis since the
1930s roiled the emirate’s real-estate market and left companies
unable to raise new funding. Property prices have fallen more
than 50 percent in the city state as banks cut mortgage lending.
