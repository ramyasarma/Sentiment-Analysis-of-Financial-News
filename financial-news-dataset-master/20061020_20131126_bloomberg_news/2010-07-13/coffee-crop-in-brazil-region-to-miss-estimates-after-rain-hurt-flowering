             Coffee output in Brazil’s Minas
Gerais state, the world’s biggest-growing region, will rise less
than expected this year after rain hurt flowering, said a
manager at the country’s second-biggest cooperative.  
 “Rains hurt output and the quality of the first beans we
harvested,” said Marcelo Moura Almeida, chief agronomist at
Cooparaiso, which accounts for about 9 percent of Brazil’s
production of arabica coffee. “Lots of short showers between
July and September made trees flower in different moments.”  
 Coffee output in Minas Gerais, which produces more than
Vietnam and Colombia, will increase 20 percent this year to 23.9
million 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags, according to the
government’s May 5 estimate. Almeida didn’t give an estimate for
the state’s output.  
 Cooparaiso, representing about 6,000 growers in 37 towns of
Minas Gerais, cut its estimate for production among its members
this year to 3.1 million bags from 3.3 million bags, Almeida
said today in a telephone interview from Sao Sebastiao do
Paraiso, Brazil. Output will climb from 2 million bags last year
because most trees in Brazil entered the best-yielding half of a
two-year cycle.  
 Cooparaiso has harvested almost 40 percent of its coffee so
far this year, Almeida said.  
 Brazil, where about 70 percent of the coffee is of the
mild-tasting arabica variety, is the world’s biggest producer.
Vietnam, the second-largest overall grower, leads output of
robusta beans, used to make instant coffee.  
 Cooxupe, which also represents growers in Minas Gerais, is
Brazil’s biggest coffee cooperative.
