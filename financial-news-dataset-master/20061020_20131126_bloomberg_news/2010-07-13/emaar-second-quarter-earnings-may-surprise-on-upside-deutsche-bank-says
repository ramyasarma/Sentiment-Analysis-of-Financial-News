             Emaar Properties PJSC’s second-
quarter earnings are likely to “surprise on the upside”
because of income from the handover of apartments at Burj
Khalifa, the world’s tallest tower in Dubai, Deutsche Bank AG
said.  
 “Emaar remains our top pick, offering undervalued
recurring income-generating assets and reduced exposure to the
Dubai market,” analysts Nabil Ahmed and Athmane Benzerroug
wrote in a report dated July 12. Property companies in Abu Dhabi
should post weak numbers in the second quarter because of the
lack of land sales and unit deliveries, according to the report.  
 Deutsche Bank said Dubai property prices continued to
decline moderately in June. “Even if the worse of the downward
trend is behind us, we believe it is still too early to call it
as through, given the massive oversupply and lack of buyers
appetite,” it said.
