             Canadian life insurance companies
are lobbying the federal government to adopt a two-tiered
accounting system that could reflect better on their capital
levels, the National Post reported.  
 The insurers are proposing that they use International
Financial Reporting Standards, while adopting another set of
rules to measure capital, the  newspaper  said.  
 Frank Swedlove , president of the Canadian Life and Health
Insurance Association, told the Post that the government and
financial regulators are aware of concerns from the insurance
industry.
