             North Korea canceled talks with
officials from the United Nations Command aimed at discussing
the sinking of a South Korean warship for the first time.  
 The meeting was canceled for “administrative reasons” and
no new date was proposed, the UN Command said in an e-mailed
statement today. The U.S.-led military body oversees an
armistice agreement in place since the end of the Korean War.  
 North Korea has denied any involvement in the March attack,
which left 46 sailors dead. The UN Security Council last week
refrained from blaming  Kim Jong Il ’s regime for the sinking and
North Korea accepted a proposal to hold working-level talks at
its border with the South.  
 A South Korean-led multinational panel said in May that
North Korea torpedoed the 1,200-ton Cheonan off the peninsula’s
west coast near the disputed border. South Korea had sought a
Security Council resolution condemning North Korea.  
 North Korea will continue its efforts to achieve a peace
agreement and denuclearization through the six-party forum, the
official Korean Central News Agency said on July 10. The
disarmament talks have been stalled for 18 months.
