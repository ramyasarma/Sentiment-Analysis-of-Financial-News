             Global oil demand will increase at a
slower pace next year, as advanced nations trail China and other
developing countries,  the International Energy Agency  said in
its first assessment of 2011.  
 Worldwide daily crude oil consumption will climb 1.3
million barrels, or 1.6 percent, to average 87.8 million a day,
the Paris-based adviser said in a monthly report today, leaving
its estimate for this year unchanged at 86.5 million. The rate
of demand growth for 2011 will be less than this year’s 2.1
percent as a result of increased fuel efficiency in the
industrialized nations of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, the IEA said.  
 “Despite economic recovery, oil demand growth slows” next
year because of “a continued structural shift away from oil in
the OECD and the dual impact of improving end-use efficiency and
gradual phase-down of economic stimulus in the non-OECD,”
according to the report.  
 China, the world’s second-largest oil user, will account
for about 30 percent of next year’s demand expansion compared
with 50 percent this year as the country’s government phases out
stimulus measures, the IEA said. Oil futures last traded at
about $75 a barrel in New York, having lost 5 percent this year
on signs the economic recovery is losing momentum.  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will need
to provide more crude in 2011 than this year as supply growth
from outside the group slows, the IEA said. OPEC, responsible
for 40 percent of worldwide output, will need to provide an
average of 29.2 million barrels a day next year, or 400,000 a
day more than in 2010.  
 Non-OPEC  
 Non-OPEC producers will boost supplies by 400,000 barrels a
day next year to 52.8 million a day, or about half the amount of
growth as this year, according to the report. The additional
supply will come from Brazil, Azerbaijan, Colombia, Ghana and
Oman. North Sea supply will decline.  
 The 11 OPEC members bound by production quotas raised
supplies last month by 40,000 barrels to 26.6 million barrels a
day, according to the IEA. That means the organization’s
compliance rate with production cuts announced in late 2008
dropped to 59 percent. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  
 Output from all 12 members fell 60,000 barrels a day in
June to 28.9 million barrels a day.  
 Oil demand is set to increase in 2010 for the first time in
three years as the global economy emerges from its worst crisis
since World War II, the IEA said. Consumption will increase by
1.8 million barrels a day, or 2.1 percent, to average 86.5
million barrels a day.  
 Refiners around the world processed 1.3 million barrels of
crude a day more in the last quarter than a year ago, handling
73.5 million barrels a day in the second quarter, according to
the report.  
 Nonetheless, oil inventories in industrialized nations rose
by 35 million barrels to 2.8 billion barrels in May, equivalent
to 61 days of consumption and near the top of their five-year
range, the agency said.
