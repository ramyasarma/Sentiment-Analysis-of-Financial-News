             Crude oil traded near a two-week
high in New York on optimism fuel demand will increase amid
improved prospects for an economic recovery in the world’s
biggest energy consumer.  
 Oil rose 2.9 percent yesterday as U.S. equities gained for
the sixth straight day after Alcoa Inc.’s earnings topped
analysts’ estimates. Prices also rose as the International
Energy Agency forecast oil demand will grow in 2011. U.S. crude
 inventories  probably fell last week, according to a Bloomberg
News survey before a government report today.  
 “Oil pricing has been handcuffed to equities so the strong
performance in U.S. equities yesterday had a lot to do with the
rally,” said  Victor Shum , a senior principal at Purvin & Gertz
Inc. in Singapore. “In the near-term, a lot will depend on
these corporate earnings reports for the second quarter.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery traded at $76.99 a barrel,
down 16 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 11:18 a.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract
jumped $2.20 to $77.15, the highest level since June 28. Futures
have gained 2.6 percent since the start of the year.  
 “Sentiment has turned positive and commodities and
equities are benefiting from that,” said  Toby Hassall , a
commodity analyst at CWA Global Markets Pty in Sydney. “It’s
the start of the quarterly earnings season, which has kicked off
on a positive note with Alcoa.”  
 Global oil demand will increase 1.6 percent in 2011 to
average 87.8 million barrels a day, the Paris-based IEA said in
its first forecast for next year. It left its estimate for 2010
unchanged with a demand growth rate of 2.1 percent to an average
87.8 million barrels a day in a report released yesterday.  
 U.S. gasoline demand rose 2.1 percent for June 30 to July 6,
the Tuesday after the July 4 holiday, from a year earlier,
according to MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse report yesterday.  
 Crude Supplies  
 U.S. crude stockpiles increased 1.74 million barrels to
353.5 million last week, according to a report from the American
Petroleum Institute. The Energy Department will probably report
that inventories fell 1.5 million barrels, a Bloomberg News
survey of 14 analysts shows.  
 Crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point
for New York futures climbed 316,000 barrels to 36.1 million.
Gasoline and distillate fuel stockpiles also rose.  
 The Petroleum Institute collects stockpile information on a
voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the Energy Department for its weekly survey.  
 Profits for S&P 500 companies are projected to have
increased 34 percent in the second quarter, according to
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Alcoa, the largest
aluminum producer, reported net income of $136 million, or 13
cents a share, exceeding the 11-cent average estimate of 17
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Brent Curve  
 Brent crude for August settlement was at $76.43 a barrel,
down 22 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
at 11:14 a.m. Singapore time. The contract earlier rose as much
as 31 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $76.96. Yesterday, it gained
$2.28, or 3.1 percent, to settle at $76.65.  
 The August contract expires tomorrow. The more active
September contract was at $76.59 a barrel, down 14 cents, at
10:57 a.m. Singapore time.  
 The August Brent contract’s discount to September has
narrowed to 8 cents a barrel, the least since Aug. 14. The
market structure where prompt prices are less than later-dated
futures is known as a contango.  
 The contango in West Texas oil futures traded in New York
has also narrowed. The price difference between the August
contract and September has narrowed to 45 cents a barrel today
from $4.59 a barrel on May 14.  
 “The main mechanism for pricing in a tightening
fundamental picture has been the shape of the curve,” said
 Amrita Sen , an analyst at Barclays Capital in a note yesterday.
“Both WTI and Brent prompt spreads tightened yesterday. With
our expectation of further growth ahead, we would expect the
process of curve flattening to continue.”
