             Investors should be neutral on
“below fair value” 10-year Treasury note  yields , according to
 Brett Rose , a strategist at Citigroup Inc.  
 The New York-based bank recommended selling 10-year notes
on July 1 as the yield dropped to 2.88 percent, the lowest level
since April 2009, on Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and evidence
the U.S. economic recovery is stalling. Since then, the yield
has increased 0.24 percentage point to 3.11 percent.  
 “Yields are still below fair value, making 10-year notes
rich, but the market is still nervous about the problems in
Europe and the slowing of the U.S. economy, so investors should
be neutral,” Rose said in a telephone interview. “There is
still a significant amount of cash on the sidelines looking to
be deployed.”  
 Investors should wait until yields approach 3.5 percent
before buying 10-year debt and sell when the benchmark
security’s yield dips below 3 percent, according to Citigroup.  
 Ten-year notes have outperformed the broader Treasury
market, returning 8.6 percent this year, compared with a 5.5
percent gain in other nominal U.S. government securities,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
