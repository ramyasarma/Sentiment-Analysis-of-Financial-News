             England batsman Ian Bell has been
ruled out of the forthcoming four-Test series against Pakistan
with a foot injury, the England and Wales Cricket Board said in
an e-mailed release.  
 He sustained the injury during the second one-day match
against Bangladesh at the weekend, and had an operation last
night on the fractured metatarsal in his left foot.  
 “We expect Ian to make a full recovery but his
participation in the NatWest Series against Pakistan in
September will be reviewed in due course once he has made
significant progress with his rehabilitation program,” the
cricket board’s chief medical officer Nick Peirce said in the
release.  
 The first of four Tests against Pakistan starts at Trent
Bridge, Nottingham, on July 29. The teams then meet in Twenty20
and one-day internationals in September.
