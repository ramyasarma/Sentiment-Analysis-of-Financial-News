             The leu depreciated for a third day
against the euro, headed for its biggest drop in two weeks, on
concern Romania’s recession will be deeper than forecast as the
government cuts spending and raises taxes to cut its deficit.  
 The second-poorest European Union country needs to extend
its loan program with the International Monetary Fund until 2013
from a 2011 expiration if it is to emerge from the worst
recession in 20 years, Ziarul Financiar reported, citing Finance
Minister  Sebastian Vladescu . The economy will probably contract
more than 1.5 percent this year after the tax increase, he said.  
 “The deterioration of the economic perspectives reinforces
our view that the leu has no upside potential left even in
favorable global market conditions,” London-based analysts at
 Societe Generale SA  wrote in a report today.  
 The leu depreciated as much as 0.4 percent and traded down
0.3 percent at 4.2609 per euro as of 5:10 p.m. in Bucharest.  
 Prime Minister  Emil Boc ’s administration raised the value-
added tax last month to 24 percent from 19 percent and made more
cuts to public-sector wages to secure further disbursements from
an  IMF -led 20 billion-euro ($25 billion) bailout program. The
IMF wants the budget deficit to be 6.8 percent of gross domestic
product or less this year.  
 Current Account  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch lowered its outlook for the
country’s 2010 economic performance to a 1.3 percent contraction
from a previous forecast of a decline of 0.7 percent, according
to a report yesterday that cited the reduction in government
spending and increased VAT. The IMF and the government estimate
the economy will shrink as much as 0.5 percent this year, after
contracting a record 7.1 percent in 2009.  
 Romania’s current-account deficit widened to 2.87 billion
euros ($3.6 billion) in May from a shortfall of 2.06 billion
euros in April and a gap of 1.97 billion euros a year earlier
because of smaller remittances from Romanian citizens working
abroad, the central bank said today.  
 The Czech koruna ended three days of gains, dropping 0.3
percent to 25.392 per euro. Poland’s zloty was little changed at
4.066 per euro, erasing earlier losses of as much as 0.3 percent
after an unexpected increase in inflation prompted speculation
the central bank will raise interest rates. The Hungarian forint
traded less than 0.1 percent stronger at 278.16 per euro.
