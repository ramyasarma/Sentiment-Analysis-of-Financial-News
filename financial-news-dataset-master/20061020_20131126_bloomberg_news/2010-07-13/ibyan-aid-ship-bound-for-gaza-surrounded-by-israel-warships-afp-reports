             A Libyan aid ship originally bound
for Gaza has been surrounded by Israeli warships, Agence France-
Presse reported, citing the charity that chartered the ship.  
 While the ship was earlier reported by Israeli and Egyptian
officials to have changed direction toward an Egyptian port, the
news agency cited the charity, the Gaddafi International Charity
and Development Foundation, as saying the ship had not changed
course and was continuing toward Gaza.
