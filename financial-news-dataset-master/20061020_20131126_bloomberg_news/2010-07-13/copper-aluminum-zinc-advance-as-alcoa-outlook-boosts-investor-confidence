             Copper, aluminum and zinc gained on
the London Metal Exchange as better-than-estimated earnings from
Alcoa Inc. increased investor confidence.  
 Copper for three-month delivery increased 0.9 percent to
$6,688.75 per metric ton, while aluminum gained 0.4 percent to
$1,979 a ton and zinc added 0.5 percent to $1,864 a ton.  
 Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, reported second-
quarter profit that topped analysts’ projections as higher metal
prices boosted sales. The company said stronger demand from end-
use markets will mean global aluminum consumption will increase
12 percent this year, compared with the 10 percent that the
company previously forecast.
