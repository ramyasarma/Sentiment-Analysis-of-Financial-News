             China National Petroleum Corp. said
it intends to increase crude oil and natural gas supplies in the
second half of this year.  
 CNPC’s first-half operations met its expectations, with a
stable increase in crude oil production and “fast growth” in
gas output, it said in a statement on its website today.
