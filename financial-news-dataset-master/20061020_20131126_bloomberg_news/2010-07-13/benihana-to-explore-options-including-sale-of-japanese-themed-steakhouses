             Benihana Inc. , the operator of
Japanese-themed steakhouses, said it’s exploring a possible sale
after investors questioned the restaurant chain’s strategy.  
 “Several large shareholders have expressed disagreement
with the board and have indicated a desire to seek board
membership to pursue a change in the company’s strategic
direction,” Chief Executive Officer  Richard Stockinger  said in a
statement today. That prompted directors to decide to review
other options, the company said.  
 While the Miami-based chain is making progress on its own,
it needs more  capital  to expand, Stockinger said. The current
stock price level is a deterrent to new offerings, he said. The
 shares  have slumped 20 percent in the past year.  
 Restaurant industry transactions have picked up as the U.S.
economy emerges from its slump. This week, Apollo Global
Management LLC completed the purchase of  CKE Restaurants Inc .,
operator of the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s fast-food chains. In
April, California Pizza Kitchen, based in Los Angeles, said it
was examining a possible sale.  
 Benihana rose 43 cents to $6.03 in Nasdaq Stock Market
 trading  today before being halted at around 4 p.m. They were
unchanged at that level in late trading.
