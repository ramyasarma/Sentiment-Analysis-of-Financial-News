             Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said the country still needs to make changes to its
taxation system even after debate on raising the 5 percent sales
tax contributed to the government’s defeat in midterm elections.  
 “There’s no doubt” that discussion about consumption tax
influenced the election outcome, Noda said at a press conference
in Tokyo today. “Still, we must undergo comprehensive tax
reforms, including to the consumption tax.”  
 Noda is a member of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan
that lost seats in an upper house election on July 11.
