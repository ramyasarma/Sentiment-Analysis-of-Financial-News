             Imperial Holdings Ltd. , the largest
owner of auto dealerships in South Africa, offered to pay 723.8
million rand ($96 million) to buy  CIC Holdings Ltd. , a Namibian
company which provides retailers merchandising services.  
 CIC jumped 10 percent to 2.75 rand, the highest in a month,
at 2.53 p.m. in Johannesburg.  
 “CIC’s proven experience in the African market and its
expertise” in its field “provides the ideal platform” for
Imperial to expand in the retail service industry in the region,
it said in a statement today.  
 In February, Imperial said it plans acquisitions in
Germany, Austria and Poland as well as the southern African
region. The Johannesburg-based company last month bought a
majority stake in Goscor Group, a diversified industrial and
engineering company.  
 Imperial gained 1 percent to 90.82 rand in Johannesburg. A
close at this price would be the strongest level since July 7.
