             Adair Turner , chairman of the U.K.
Financial Services Authority, said changes to the financial
system must go beyond the symptoms of the credit crisis and
address the need for radical structural reform.  
 Attacking bank bonuses for sales of financial products that
have “little real use to humanity” alone won’t guarantee a
financial recovery, Turner will say in a speech in London.  
 Financial regulation isn’t useful “unless it puts in place
new policy tools to take away the punchbowl of excessive credit
and property price inflation before the party gets out of
hand,” Turner will say today, according to excerpts of the
speech distributed by the FSA.  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said last month
he will abolish the FSA and give most of its power to the Bank
of England by 2012. Politicians criticized the FSA for failing
to take more action to prevent the global financial crisis.  
 In a separate speech to the British Bankers’ Association
yesterday, Turner said that the FSA’s approach to regulation
before the crisis, including mortgages and the housing market,
reflected an attempt to balance “consumer choice and consumer
protection.”  
 “In the years of the credit boom, the net effect of all
those decisions -- a dynamic, competitive market in mortgages,
with maximum freedom of choice and easily available credit --
was one with which most of society seemed happy,” Turner said
in London. “We are signaling today a significant shift away
from that approach; but how much we shift is not a purely
technical issue which can be left to technicians; it is a social
and political choice which should merit extensive debate.”  
 Turner, Sants  
 Turner will serve as chairman of the FSA until it is folded
into the Bank of England while chief executive officer  Hector Sants  will head the Bank’s new Prudential Regulatory Authority
and oversee the transition.  
 The U.K. financial regulator will split into two divisions,
a prudential regulatory authority and a consumer protection and
markets agency, or CPMA, to ready itself for the transition.
Turner called for a debate on whether the watchdog should have
more powers and pledged “a more pre-emptive approach” to
protect consumers.  
 There needs to be discussion on whether the new
organization should have a role in setting competition policy
and scrutinizing profit margins, he said.  
 “In some senses it is strange that my earlier list of
conduct policy tools included regulation, customer
responsibility and capability, but did not mention competition,”
he added.
