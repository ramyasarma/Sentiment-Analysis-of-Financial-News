             Pfizer Inc. , the world’s largest
drugmaker, and other drug companies must face a price-fixing
suit claiming they conspired to keep cheaper medicines from
Canada out of the U.S. market.  
 The California Supreme Court today  reversed  a lower court,
which two years ago granted dismissal of the suit by allowing
the companies to use a “pass-on” defense. The companies argued
they couldn’t be held liable for illegal drug overcharges -- and
that the pharmacies weren’t harmed -- because any overcharge was
passed on to consumers.  
 The ruling means that in California “no price-fixer is
going to get off on the basis that the victim might have passed
on to its customers the amount of the price fix,”  Joseph M. Alioto , a lawyer representing pharmacies said in an interview.
“Price fixers cannot raise this defense against anybody.”  
 A  California appeals court  had upheld a trial judge’s
dismissal of the suit, filed in 2004, against Pfizer and 18
other pharmaceutical makers alleging they inflated drug prices,
leading drugstores to pay more than they should have. The court
ruled retailers passed the alleged price increases onto their
customers, so they can’t seek damages.  
 Today, the California high court rejected that argument and
sent the case back to the trial court in Oakland, Alioto said.  
 Pfizer spokesman  Chris Loder  said he couldn’t immediately
comment on the case.  
 The defendants include Eli Lilly & Co., AstraZeneca Plc,
and GlaxoSmithKline Plc.  
 The case is James Clayworth v. Pfizer, S166435, California
Supreme Court (San Francisco).
