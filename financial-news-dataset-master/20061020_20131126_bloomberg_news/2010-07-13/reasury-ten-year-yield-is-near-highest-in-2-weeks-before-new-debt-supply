             Treasury 10-year notes fell for a
fifth day, the longest losing streak in 11 months, as the U.S.
prepared to auction $21 billion of the securities today and
global stocks rallied, damping demand for the safest assets.  
 Government  bonds  erased earlier gains as U.S. stocks
climbed, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index extending the
longest winning streak in three months. The Treasury sale today
is the second of three note and bond offerings this week
totaling $69 billion.  
 “Risk seems to be a back in vogue a little, and supply is
coming, which is weighing on the market,” said  Larry Milstein ,
managing director of government and agency debt trading in New
York at R.W. Pressprich & Co. “Earnings reports will set the
stage for the equity market, and Treasuries will trade off of
equities given the lack of data.”  
 The  yield  on the 10-year note rose 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.08 percent at 10:29 a.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The last time it increased
for five straight days was the period ended Aug. 7. It touched
3.09 percent today, the highest level since June 28 The 3.5
percent security due in May 2020 fell 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000
face amount, to 103 1/2.  
 Ten-year yields fell as low as 3.02 percent earlier today
as Portugal’s credit debt rating was cut two steps to A1 from
Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service. They pared gains after Greece
sold 1.625 billion euros ($1.26 billion) of bills at 4.65
percent, lower than the 5 percent some analysts anticipated.  
 The S&P 500 Index advanced 1.2 percent, and the MSCI World
Index gained 1.4 percent.  
 Pre-Auction Trading  
 The 10-year U.S. securities scheduled for sale today
yielded 3.086 percent in pre-auction trading, compared with
3.242 percent at the previous sale of the notes on June 9.  
 Investors  bid  for 3.24 times the amount of debt on offer
last month. The average bid-to-cover ratio at the prior 10
auctions including June is 3.03. Indirect bidders, the group
that includes foreign central banks, bought 40.2 percent of the
debt, versus the 10-sale average of 40.7 percent.  
 Ten-year notes, among the most sensitive to inflation, are
outperforming shorter-maturity debt as consumer prices fall. The
securities have returned 8.6 percent this year, versus 5.5
percent for the broader market, Bank of America indexes show.  
 The U.S. yesterday sold $35 billion of three-year notes at
a record low yield of 1.055 percent. The Treasury will conclude
this week’s sales with a $13 billion 30-year auction tomorrow.
President  Barack Obama  has increased the U.S. marketable  debt  to
a record $7.96 trillion as he tries to sustain the expansion.  
 Retail Sales  
 A decline in U.S. retail sales slowed last month, falling
0.3 percent in June after a 1.2 percent drop in May, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of 74 economists before a government
report due tomorrow.  
 “We’re holding our bias to see 10-year yields test the
3.18 to 3.21 percent zone without a great deal of struggle,”
 David Ader , head of government bond strategy at Stamford,
Connecticut-based CRT Capital Group LLC, wrote in a note to
clients. “There is a possibility of a move toward the large
volume bulge from June between 3.26 percent and 3.30 percent.”  
 The 10-year yield will climb to 3.36 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg survey of banks and securities
companies’ projections, with the most recent forecasts given the
heaviest weightings.  
 The U.S. economy will expand 3.3 percent this year and 2.9
percent in 2011, following a 2.4 percent contraction in 2009,
according to International Monetary Fund estimates made July 7.  
 Trade Deficit  
 The U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly widened in May to the
highest level since November 2008 as a gain in imports outpaced
growth in exports, Commerce Department data showed today. The
gap expanded 4.8 percent to $42.3 billion. Imports and exports
rose to the highest level since 2008.  
 The  difference  between yields on 10-year  notes  and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, narrowed to 1.86 percentage points from
this year’s high of 2.49 percentage points in January.  
 Traders trimmed bets the Fed will raise its benchmark
interest rate, which has been at a record low range of zero to
0.25 percent since 2008, by its December meeting, according to
futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange. The chance fell to 12
percent, from 27 percent a month ago.
