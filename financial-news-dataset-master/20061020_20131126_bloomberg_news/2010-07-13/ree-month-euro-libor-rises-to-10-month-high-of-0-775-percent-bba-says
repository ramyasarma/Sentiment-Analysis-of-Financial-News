             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros in London climbed to the highest
level in 10 months, data from the British Bankers’ Association
showed.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
was at 0.775 percent, the most since Sept. 3, 2009, the BBA said
today. The rate was 0.766 percent yesterday. The euro Libor-OIS
spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to lend, fell one basis
point to 23 basis points as of 11:57 a.m. in London.  
 Three-month dollar Libor was little changed at 0.526
percent, the BBA said.  
 Three-month Euribor rose to 0.835 percent, the most since
Aug. 25, 2009, from 0.827 percent yesterday, according to data
from the European Banking Federation.
