             Ssangyong Motor Co. , a South Korean
carmaker under bankruptcy protection, will delay the deadline
for binding bids for a controlling stake to give more time to
bidders to carry out due diligence.  
 Potential buyers are to submit binding bids by Aug. 10,
from an earlier deadline of July 20, after they requested more
time to prepare their proposals, the Pyeongtaek, South Korea-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Due diligence
was due to be completed by July 16, Ssangyong said in May.  
 Nissan Motor Co.  of Japan and  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.  of
India are among companies that are conducting due diligence for
the more than 50 percent stake in Ssangyong. Korean internet
news service MoneyToday reported in May that the stake may worth
at least 700 billion won ($583 million).  
 Ssangyong , maker of the Rexton sport-utility vehicle and
Chairman premium sedan, fell 3.5 percent to 14,000 won as of
10:22 a.m. in Seoul. The key Kospi index gained 0.6 percent.  
 The automaker went into bankruptcy protection in February
2009 after higher oil prices and the global recession squeezed
sales of its mainstay SUVs, resulting in a cash shortage.
