             National Bank of Canada , the
country’s sixth-biggest bank, was cited among five “defensive”
financial stocks by Morgan Stanley.  
 “We would recommend National Bank as the most defensive
within the Canadian banks, the strongest asset quality and also
the most insulation to potential weakness in the U.S. and the
broader global economy,” Morgan Stanley analyst  Cheryl Pate 
said on a conference call today.  
 Morgan Stanley also recommended  Chubb Corp. , MetLife Inc.,
 People’s United Financial Inc.  and Travelers Cos. for a
“defensive portfolio” in case the U.S. economy is weaker than
expected. Montreal-based National Bank was highlighted because
it has “very little” international exposure, earning 65
percent of revenue from the province of Quebec.  
 National Bank may also raise its  dividend  one quarter
before Canada’s other banks, Pate said in the webcast call.  
 “We believe the next catalyst for National is going to be
a dividend increase,” Pate said. “We think National’s going to
be the first of the Canadian banks to raise the dividend, and
we’re expecting this in the fourth quarter of this year.”  
 Morgan Stanley named Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase
& Co., Prudential Financial Inc., TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.
and Zions Bancorporation for its top five picks for financial
stocks in a July 12 note, given a slowly improving credit and
regulatory environment.
