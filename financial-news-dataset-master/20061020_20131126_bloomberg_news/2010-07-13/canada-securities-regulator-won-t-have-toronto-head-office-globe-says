             Canadian securities officials will
announce today that their plan for creating a national
securities regulator doesn’t include a centralized head office,
the Globe and Mail reported, citing unidentified people.  
 Instead, it will call for regional offices across Canada,
beginning with Toronto and Vancouver, the  newspaper  said. The
proposal was drawn up by a transition team led by  Doug Hyndman ,
former chairman of the British Columbia Securities Commission.  
 Ontario Premier  Dalton McGuinty  has lobbied for the new
regulator to have a head office in Toronto, home to the
country’s financial center, the Globe reported.
