             Asian stocks  fell and the yen
strengthened after Infosys Technologies Ltd. posted lower first-
quarter profit and China said it will “strictly enforce”
policies enacted to quash real estate speculation.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index  slid 0.5 percent to 115.60 at
12:55 p.m. in Tokyo. Futures for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
were little changed. The yen appreciated to 88.48 per dollar in
Tokyo from 88.62 in New York yesterday. The Japanese currency
was at 111.37 per euro from 111.62 yesterday.  
 Infosys  fell 2.3 percent, the most in seven weeks, after
India’s second-largest software services provider reported
profit that fell short of analyst estimates. The results
outweighed better-than-expected earnings from  Alcoa Inc ., posted
after U.S. trading had closed.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  sank 1.8 percent, led by
property developers, after the Chinese government said it will
maintain lending curbs.
