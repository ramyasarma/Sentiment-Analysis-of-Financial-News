             China’s livestock feed production
may grow more slowly in 2010, the China National Grain & Oils
Information Center said.  
 Livestock feed output may increase 3.9 percent to 154
million metric tons from 148 million tons last year. Production
expanded 8.4 percent in 2009, the state-backed center said in an
e-mailed daily report, citing the Ministry of Agriculture.
