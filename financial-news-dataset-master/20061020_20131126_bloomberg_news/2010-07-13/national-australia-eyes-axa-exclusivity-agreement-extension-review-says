             National Australia Bank Ltd. is
preparing to negotiate another extension of an exclusivity
agreement with Axa SA to complete its purchase of the Australian
and New Zealand assets of Axa Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd., the
Australian Financial Review reported.  
 Progress has been delayed by months of negotiations with
Australia’s competition regulator, according to the report.
National Australia Bank’s second exclusivity agreement with Axa
expires at midnight tomorrow, the newspaper said.
