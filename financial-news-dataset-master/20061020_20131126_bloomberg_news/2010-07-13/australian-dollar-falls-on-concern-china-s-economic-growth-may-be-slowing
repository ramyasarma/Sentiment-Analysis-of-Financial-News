             Australia’s dollar fell, retreating
from near the strongest this month, on concerns economic growth
is slowing in China, the South Pacific nation’s largest trading
partner.  
 The so-called Aussie slid to 87.25 U.S. cents as of 1:50
p.m. in Sydney from 87.59 cents yesterday in New York.
