             Phoenix Solar AG rose 7.1 percent in
German trading as the solar-power equipment maker raised 21.4
million euros ($27.2 million) by selling new stock in an
offering restricted to institutional investors.  
 The shares climbed 2.37 euros to close at 35.53 euros.
Sulzemoos, Germany-based Phoenix Solar said in a statement that
it sold the stock at 32 euros a share. The new equity, which
will increase shares outstanding by about 10 percent, were sold
at a 3.5 percent discount to its closing price yesterday.  
 Existing stockholders had no subscription rights for the
new shares, which were offered to professional investors and
should begin to trade tomorrow, Phoenix Solar said. The one-day
sale was organized by Commerzbank AG.  
 The proceeds will also fund the company’s
“internationalization,” it said today.
