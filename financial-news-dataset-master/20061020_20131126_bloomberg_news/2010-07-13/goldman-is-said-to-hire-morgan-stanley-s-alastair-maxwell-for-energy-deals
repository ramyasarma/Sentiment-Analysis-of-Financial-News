             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  hired
 Alastair Maxwell , Morgan Stanley’s head of energy investment
banking in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, to join the firm
in London, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  
 Maxwell will join Goldman in October, said the person who
declined to be identified because the appointment hasn’t been
made public. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London and a
spokesman for  Morgan Stanley  declined to comment.  
 At Morgan Stanley, Maxwell’s group worked with the
government of Ghana on offshore oil and gas deposits, advising
it when Kosmos Energy LLC tried last year to sell a stake in the
$3.1 billion Jubilee oil field to  Exxon Mobil Corp.  Goldman’s
energy clients include London-based BP Plc, which plans to raise
$10 billion selling assets as it tries to contain the worst oil
spill in U.S. history in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 The oil and gas industry is the second-biggest mergers and
acquisitions market by volume this year, with $78 billion of
announced transactions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
BP’s $7 billion purchase of Devon Energy Corp. assets in Brazil,
Azerbaijan and the Gulf of Mexico was the biggest takeover, the
data show.  
 BP is in talks to sell a stake in Alaskan assets to Apache
Corp. of the U.S. which may be worth $12 billion, people
familiar with the matter said July 11.
