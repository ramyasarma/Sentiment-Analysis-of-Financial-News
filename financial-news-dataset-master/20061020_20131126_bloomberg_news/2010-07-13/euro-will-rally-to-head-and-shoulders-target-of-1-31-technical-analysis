             The euro will rally to the reverse
head-and-shoulders target of $1.31 after falling from an eight-
week high, according to Citigroup Inc., citing trading patterns.  
 “The downward correction may have run its course,”
strategists led by  Tom Fitzpatrick  in New York wrote in a note
to clients published today. “The euro can now make the next
move higher.”  
 Strategists at the New York-based bank established a long
position on the 16-nation currency at $1.2578 after it formed a
reverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Investors should exit the
trade if the euro falls to $1.2460, according to Citigroup.  
 The euro appreciated 0.7 percent to $1.2680 at 11:06 a.m.
in New York, from $1.2596 yesterday, when it dropped 0.4
percent. It slid 0.5 percent on July 9, when it touched $1.2722,
the highest level since May 12.  
 A head-and-shoulders pattern is formed when a currency
makes three consecutive peaks on a chart, with the middle being
the highest. A neckline is a line connecting the two lowest
points, and a breach of that may signal the reversal of a trend.
A reverse head-and-shoulders pattern has three troughs.  
 A fall in German government bond  yields  and a rally in the
dollar on demand for relative safety pushed the euro lower
yesterday, Fitzpatrick said in a telephone interview.  
 “We had a dynamic that created a sharp downward movement
in the euro that has since stabilized,” he said.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. A long position is a bet
a security will gain.
