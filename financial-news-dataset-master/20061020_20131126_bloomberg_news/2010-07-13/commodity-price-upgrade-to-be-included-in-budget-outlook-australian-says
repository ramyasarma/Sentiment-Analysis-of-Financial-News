             Revised economic forecasts to be
released today by Treasurer Wayne Swan will include an upgrade
to the outlook for commodity prices, the Australian newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The upgrade could add as much as A$5 billion to company tax
takes, the newspaper said, adding that higher commodity prices
have already boosted the expected receipts from a proposed new
tax on mining companies’ profits.  
 The economic forecast may also show the nation’s
unemployment rate dropping below 5 percent this year, the
Australian said.  
 Julia Gillard’s Labor government could get a pre-election
boost from the forecast, the newspaper reported. Local media
have speculated Gillard could set the date for a national
election as early as this week.
