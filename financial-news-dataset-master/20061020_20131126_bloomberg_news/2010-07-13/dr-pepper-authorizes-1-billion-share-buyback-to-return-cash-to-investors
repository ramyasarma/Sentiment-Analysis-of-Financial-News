             Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. , the
third-largest U.S. soda maker, said its board authorized the
repurchase of $1 billion in shares over the next three years to
return cash to shareholders.  
 The beverage maker now has $1.45 billion in share
repurchases outstanding out of $2 billion in authorizations,
according to a statement today. The Plano, Texas-based company
had 245.7 million shares outstanding as of May 3, regulatory
filings show.  
 Dr Pepper Snapple, led by Chief Executive Officer  Larry Young , said its free cash flow and a $715 million distribution
payment from  Coca-Cola Co.  allowed it to increase share
repurchases. The shares of Dr Pepper Snapple had gained 36
percent this year before today.  
 Coca-Cola last month agreed to sell brands including Dr
Pepper and Canada Dry in some regions of the U.S. and Canada for
20 years.  
 Dr Pepper Snapple  rose  62 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $39.20
at 10:18 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
