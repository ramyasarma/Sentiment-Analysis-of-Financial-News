             Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said legislation implementing his March budget, which
passed the Senate intact last night, will allow the government
to exit stimulus spending and restore budget balance.  
 “We have an exit strategy and a plan to return to budget
balance over the medium term by restraining the growth of
program spending,” Flaherty said in a  statement  today.  
 The Senate Committee on  National Finance  last week proposed
changes to the government’s budget legislation, taking out
measures including those relating to government-owned Canada
Post and  Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.  Late last night, the
Senate voted 48 to 44 to defeat the changes, and passed the
original legislation. The bill also received royal assent and
has now completed the legislative process.  
 Had the Conservatives failed to win the vote, the amended
legislation could have been sent back to the House of Commons
for a new vote. The Conservative government lacks a majority of
Commons seats and budget bills are confidence matters, meaning
that a defeat in the Commons would have led to an election.  
 In the Senate, the governing Conservatives have 52  seats 
compared with 49 for the Liberals. There are two Progressive
Conservatives and two unaffiliated Senators.
