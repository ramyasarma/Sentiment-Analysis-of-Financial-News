             Telecom Italia SpA plans to move
ahead with 3,700 job cuts by the end of 2011 unless it can reach
an agreement to offer workers early retirement, Antonio
Migliardi, the company’s chief of human resources, said in an
interview with Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper.  
 The company is open to making early retirement an option as
long as there are “certainties on the timing,” Migliardi said.
The government has invited Telecom Italia management and unions
to meet tomorrow to discuss the cuts.
