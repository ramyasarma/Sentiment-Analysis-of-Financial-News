             Credit Suisse Standard Securities 
ended coverage of  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. , Africa’s largest producer
of the steelmaking ingredient, after the resignation of
Veneshree Naidoo, who researched the stock.  
 The brokerage, a Johannesburg-based venture between  Credit
Suisse Group AG  and  Standard Bank Group Ltd. , today also
terminated analysis of Assore Ltd. and  African Rainbow Minerals
Ltd.  following Naidoo’s departure, Yushavia Naidoo, head of
legal and compliance, said in a telephone interview.  
 No decision has been made on her post, Naidoo said,
declining to give more details on the analyst. The brokerage in
May ended coverage of Allied Electronics Corp., Allied
Technologies Ltd.,  Dimension Data Plc , Reunert Ltd. and  Datatec
Ltd.  after  Peter Takaendesa  resigned, Naidoo said.  
 Credit Suisse and Johannesburg-based Standard Bank are
seeking to terminate their venture a year before the expiry next
year of a five-year agreement, two people with knowledge of the
discussions said last week. Zurich-based Credit Suisse wants to
increase its presence in Africa’s largest economy to also
include investment banking, while expanding its existing private
bank, one person said.
