             SKC Co. , the world’s biggest maker
of polyester film used in solar cells and display panels,
expects sales to surge 79 percent by 2012 as the company adds
capacity to meet demand for renewable energy and televisions.  
 Revenue  may rise to 2.64 trillion won ($2.2 billion) in
three years from 1.47 trillion won in 2009, Chief Executive
Officer  Park Jang Suk  said in an interview at the company’s
headquarters in Seoul yesterday. Sales, including those of its
units, will probably reach 1.8 trillion won this year, he said.  
 “SKC and its units plan to invest about 900 billion won
over the next three years,” Park, 55, said. “Particularly, we
will focus on film for solar power, which will grow sharply.”  
 The unit of  SK Group , South Korea’s third-largest
conglomerate, has  surged  57 percent this year as investors bet
demand for solar-power equipment will increase as governments
worldwide seek to reduce emissions blamed for global warming.
 First Solar Inc. , the world’s biggest renewable energy company
by market value, said in February that the market for solar
modules will climb 36 percent to 7,500 megawatts this year.  
 Shares  of SKC advanced 1.4 percent to 29,700 won as of
11:15 a.m. in Seoul trading. The stock is the eighth-best
performing stock on the Kospi 200 Index.  
 Demand for flat-panel televisions is also boosting sales of
SKC’s polyester film, which accounts for 60 percent of the
company’s operating profit. Chemicals including propylene oxide
used in mattresses and seat cushions make up the rest.  
 “SKC will benefit from short supply and increasing demand
for polyester film at least over the next two years,” said
 Hwang Kyu Won , an analyst at Tong Yang Securities Inc.  
 TV Demand  
 Global shipments of liquid-crystal display televisions may
rise 24 percent to more than 180 million units in 2010, Austin,
Texas-based  DisplaySearch  said in March.  
 Sales of solar-cell film may increase more than sevenfold
to 270 billion won by 2012 from 35 billion won last year, Park
said.  SKC Solmics Co. , a unit of the company, plans to produce
silicon ingots and wafers to make solar batteries, he said.  
 SKC Solmics said in February it will spend 32.7 billion won
on a 50-megawatt ingot production facility in Pyeongtaek, south
of Seoul, with commercial production due to start in November.  
 Shares of  Woongjin Energy Co. , a South Korean solar-cell
ingots producer, almost doubled from its debut on June 30 as
investors expect the company will benefit from alternative
energy demand in the U.S.  
 SKC also plans to produce materials used in rechargeable
batteries next year, CEO Park said, without giving details
including capacity.  
 South Korea plans to invest as much as 15 trillion won in
rechargeable battery technology by 2020, the Ministry of
Knowledge Economy said on July 11.
