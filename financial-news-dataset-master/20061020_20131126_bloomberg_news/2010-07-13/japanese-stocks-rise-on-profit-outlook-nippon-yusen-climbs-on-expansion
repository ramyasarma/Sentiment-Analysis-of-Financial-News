             Japanese  stocks  fell as a stronger
yen hurt the outlook for export earnings, while steelmakers
retreated on concern China’s demand for the alloy will weaken.  
 Fanuc Ltd., an industrial robot maker which gets almost 80
percent of sales abroad, declined 2.1 percent. Honda Motor Co.,
Japan’s second largest carmaker which derives more than 80
percent of its sales abroad, declined 1.8 percent.  Nippon Steel
Corp.  sank 2.3 percent after the Chinese government said it will
push for consolidation in the steel industry and curb any rapid
increase in output.  
 “Demand for steel and iron may drop as a plan to moderate
steel production was announced by the government” of China,
said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees $450 million at Tokyo-based
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.1 percent to 9,537.23
at the close in Tokyo. The broader  Topix  index retreated 0.4
percent to 854.39 after rising as much as 0.7 percent.  
 The Topix has retreated 5.9 percent in 2010, compared with
drops of 3.3 percent by the  S&P 500  and 1.1 percent by the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index . Shares in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
16.6 times estimated  earnings , compared with 13.2 times for the
S&P and 11.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  
 Fanuc slumped 2.1 percent to 10,400 yen. Honda declined 1.8
percent to 2,639 yen. Panasonic Corp., the world’s biggest maker
of home electronics which earns almost half its sales overseas,
dropped 1 percent to 1,179 yen.  
 Yen Strengthens  
 The yen appreciated to 88.57, compared with 88.92 against
the dollar at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency strengthened to 111.37 from
111.99. The stronger yen reduces income when overseas revenue is
converted into local currency.  
 Nippon Steel  fell 2.3 percent to 301 yen. JFE Holdings Inc.
lost 2.4 percent to 2,704 yen. Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd.
dropped 1.9 percent to 208 yen.  
 China will push for mergers and acquisitions within the
steel industry and curb any rapid increase in production, Li
Yizhong, head of the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, said in a speech posted on the ministry’s website
today. The ministry will further regulate iron-ore imports, Li
said.  
 Credit Suisse Group yesterday reiterated its
“underweight” rating on Japanese iron and steel producers
saying they should cut production because they face higher
material costs, lower sales and pressure to cut prices.  
 East Japan Railway Co.  lost 2.7 percent to 5,830 yen, after
the railway operator, known as JR East, was lowered to
“underweight” from “neutral” at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
