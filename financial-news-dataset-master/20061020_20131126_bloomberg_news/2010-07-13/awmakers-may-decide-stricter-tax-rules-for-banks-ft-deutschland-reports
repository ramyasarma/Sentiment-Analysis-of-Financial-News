             Lawmakers in German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s CDU/CSU bloc are considering introducing
stricter tax rules for the country’s banks,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing unidentified members of the bloc.  
 Lawmakers may seek to prevent lenders from setting up
“bogus banks” in tax havens, the newspaper said in an e-mailed
preview of a report to be published in today’s edition. It’s
unclear whether the governing coalition’s Free Democratic Party
partner will agree to the proposals, the newspaper said.
