             Australia lost six wickets in the
final session, reaching 229-9 at stumps on the first day of the
opening cricket Test against Pakistan at Lord’s in London.  
 Australia had reached 171-3 at tea, helped by a third-
wicket stand of 120 by Simon Katich and Michael Clarke, who was
leg-before-wicket for 47.  
 Then Katich was dismissed for 80, to be followed by  Marcus North , Tim Paine, Steve Smith, Mitchell Johnson and  Ben Hilfenhaus  as Pakistan regained control. Play was ended by bad
light at about 6:30 p.m., with Michael Hussey on 39 and Doug
Bollinger yet to score. Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asif each
took three wickets, Asif’s haul coming in seven balls either
side of tea.  
 Pakistan had won the toss and put Australia in to bat after
rain delayed the start, restricting the morning’s action to 13
overs.  
 In the morning session, Shane Watson was bowled by
Aamer after making four runs, and the same bowler had Australia
captain  Ricky Ponting  caught by Umar Amin after lunch for 26,
leaving the score at 51-2.  
 It’s the first neutral Test at the “home of cricket”
since 1912 and is being held there because of security concerns
over staging matches in Pakistan. The two-match series counts as
a “home” event for Pakistan.
