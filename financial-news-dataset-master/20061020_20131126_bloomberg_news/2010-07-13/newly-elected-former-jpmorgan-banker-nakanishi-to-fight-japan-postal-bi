             Kenji Nakanishi , a former  JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  banker elected to Japan’s parliament two days ago,
said he will fight proposed legislation to strengthen the state-
owned postal savings system.  
 Nakanishi, 46, was one of 10 members of “ Your Party ” to
win seats in elections for the Diet’s  upper house . The new party
will oppose the government plan to double the cap on deposits at
the nation’s postal bank to 20 million yen ($225,000) and keep a
stake in the company after taking it public, he said.  
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s  Democratic Party of Japan  lost
its majority in the upper house and coalition partner the
 People’s New Party  failed to win any seats in the July 11 vote.
PNP head  Shizuka Kamei  is the driving force behind the Japan
Post bill, which Kan delayed before the election.  
 “What Japan should do is to invigorate the private
sector,” Nakanishi said in an interview. “What the DPJ and
Kamei’s party are doing is totally the opposite. Japan Post’s
government links will hurt other banks.”  
 Kan’s party still controls the more powerful lower house,
though without the two-thirds majority needed to overrule
objections from the upper chamber. Your Party leader  Yoshimi Watanabe  has ruled out joining the coalition, saying he
preferred to work with the government on policies where he
shares a common perspective.  
 Kamei’s proposed legislation would allow  Japan Post Bank
Co. , the world’s biggest bank by deposits, to double the amount
of savings it takes from individual customers and potentially
start offering loans. The government plans to keep at least a
one-third stake in Japan Post after an initial public offering.  
 Stake Sale  
 The government should sell its entire stake in Japan Post
and keep the deposit cap no higher than 10 million yen to
prevent it from discouraging private sector competition,
Nakanishi said. More than half of the savings are used to
purchase Japanese government bonds.   
 Nakanishi, who quit as JPMorgan’s Japan deputy president
last year, won a seat in Kanagawa prefecture, southwest of
Tokyo. Other victorious Your Party candidates included Kouta
Matsuda, former president of Tully’s Coffee Japan Co.  
 More than half of 1,318 investment bankers and executives
surveyed by BizReach Inc., a Tokyo-based recruitment company,
said in May they may support the new party. The survey was open
to 24,000 registered users of the firm and conducted between May
10 and May 14.
