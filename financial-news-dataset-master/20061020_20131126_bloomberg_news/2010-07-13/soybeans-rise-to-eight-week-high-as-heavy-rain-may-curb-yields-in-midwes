             Soybeans rose to an eight-week high
on speculation that heavy Midwest rainfall during the past six
weeks will reduce yields in the U.S., the world’s largest grower
and exporter.  
 About 65 percent of the  crop  was rated good or excellent on
July 11, down from 66 percent a year earlier and 75 percent in
the week ended June 6, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
yesterday. Conditions deteriorated in Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri,
Kansas and Ohio. Those states accounted for 44 percent of the
2009 record harvest, USDA data show.  
 “Soybean crop conditions fell below last year, and that is
a positive factor” for prices, said  Greg Grow , the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
“The crop is getting smaller.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 3.5 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $9.545 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price reached $9.625, the highest level for the
most-active contract since May 14. The oilseed has gained 5.8
percent this month.  
 U.S. inventories totaled 571 million bushels as of June 1,
down 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the government said on
June 30. That marked the lowest level since 2004. Reserves will
fall to 175 million bushels, 5.4 percent less than June’s
forecast, the USDA said last week.  
 “Soybean supplies are tight,” Grow said. “There is
little margin for crop problems this year.”  
 Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $31.8
billion in 2008, government figures show. Corn is the biggest at
$48.6 billion.
