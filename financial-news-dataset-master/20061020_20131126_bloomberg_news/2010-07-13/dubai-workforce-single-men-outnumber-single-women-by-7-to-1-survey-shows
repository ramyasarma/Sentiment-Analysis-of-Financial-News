             Single men outnumbered single women
by almost 7-to-1 in Dubai’s mostly expatriate workforce last
year, government figures show.  
 The number of single men working in Dubai reached 349,124,
while the population of single employed women was 51,441,
according to the 2009  labor force survey  posted on the Dubai
Statistics Center website today.  
 Dubai has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure to
attract expatriate workers to its financial services, real
estate and tourism industries. The working population of the
emirate is more than 90 percent foreign, with almost 45 percent
employed in construction, according to government figures.  
 Men and women are forbidden from cohabitating outside of
marriage and public displays of affection are discouraged in
Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates. Unlike in Saudi Arabia,
the Arab world’s largest economy, single women can obtain work
visas without difficulty in the U.A.E.
