             The Australian and New Zealand
dollars may climb to their strongest levels in at least nine
weeks if they break above the “important” June highs, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. said, citing trading patterns.  
 The so-called Aussie may target an advance to its 200-day
moving average of 89.76 U.S. cents and then toward 90.78 cents,
the bank said. That’s near the 76.4 percent Fibonacci
retracement of its decline from this year’s high in April to the
low in May, Bloomberg data show. New Zealand’s currency may rise
to 72.15 cents and then reach 73.30 cents, near its April high,
 Niall O’Connor , a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan,
wrote in a research note.  
 “Both the Australian and New Zealand dollars are
approaching the important June highs,” O’Connor said. “These
levels should define whether a deeper retracement is underway,
although some initial pause seems likely given the importance of
these levels.”  
 Australia’s currency traded at 87.63 U.S. cents as of 12:01
p.m. in Sydney from 87.59 cents in New York yesterday, when it
reached 87.93 cents, the most since June 22. It traded as high
as 90.79 on May 10. New Zealand’s dollar gained 0.2 percent to
71.33 U.S. cents and earlier touched 71.46 cents, its highest
since June 28.  
 The Aussie faces “an important test,” O’Connor said, near
its June high of 88.59 cents, while the kiwi will face so-called
resistance between 71.20 and 71.60 cents. The New Zealand
dollar’s 200-day moving average stands at 71.19 cents and it
reached last month’s high of 71.60 cents on June 23.  
 Fibonacci charts are based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
new high or low. In technical analysis, investors and analysts
study charts of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes
in a security, commodity, currency or index.
