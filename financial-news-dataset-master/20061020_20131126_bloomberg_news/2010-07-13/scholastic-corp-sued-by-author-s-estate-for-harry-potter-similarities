             The estate of U.K. author Adrian
Jacobs sued Scholastic Corp. in New York alleging that the best-
selling “Harry Potter” books are “substantially similar” to
his 1987 book “Willy the Wizard.”  The copyright infringement
lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in New York today alleges
that J.K. Rowling, the author of the Potter books, which have
sold more than 375 million copies worldwide, shared the same
literary agent as Jacobs.
