             The chairman of the U.K.’s Office
for Budget Responsibility, Alan Budd, denied that he came under
pressure from ministers to publish data on jobs in the public
sector.  
 “There was no conspiracy or pressure on us to change the
numbers and no pressure on us to bring forward publication,”
Budd told lawmakers in London today. The “decision was
completely ours. We thought it correct to release the
numbers.”
