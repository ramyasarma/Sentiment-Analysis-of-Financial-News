             U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields
may fall as low as 2.53 percent should they surpass a key level,
Barclays Capital Plc analysts said, citing technical indicators.  
 The yield on the 10-year notes may fall to a target yield
between 2.78 percent and 2.53 percent if it breaks below 3
percent, which may be prompted by a decline in the equity
market, according to Barclays.  
 “While equities are likely to continue on their upside
correction, gains should prove far more labored,” analysts
including  Philip Roberts  in London wrote in a note to clients
today. “Speculative positioning has quickly reached bullish
extremes, indicating a labored and choppy advance in the week
ahead.”  
 The Treasury futures contract expiring September may hold
at the so called support level between 121 20-11/32, the note
said. The contract expiring September fell 0.2 percent to 121
26/32 at 4:30 p.m. in London, while the yield on 10-year
Treasuries was 3 basis points higher at 3.09 percent, the most
since June 28.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.
