             Cofco Ltd., China’s biggest grain
trader, bought one more corn shipment from the U.S., bringing
the company’s purchases this year to 14 cargoes, or about
840,000 tons, two executives familiar with the transaction said.  
 State-owned Cofco bought the shipment on July 9, the people
said. The cargo is 60,000 tons with 10 percent variation either
side, they said, declining to be identified as the transaction
isn’t public.  
 The cargo is scheduled to arrive in China in September,
with optional destinations including Guangdong, Jiangyin near
Shanghai, and Shandong. Total corn purchases by China this year
may total 1.1 million tons, with the bulk bought by Cofco, they
said. A Cofco official declined to comment.
