             German stocks  advanced for a sixth
day, with the benchmark DAX Index posting the longest winning
streak in 10 months, as carmakers rose after Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG lifted its earnings projections.  
 BMW, the world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, jumped to
the highest level since January 2008.  ThyssenKrupp AG  gained as
Berenberg Bank recommended Germany’s largest steelmaker. Henkel
AG retreated 1.2 percent as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgraded
the stock.  
 “BMW earnings are helping improve the sentiment today,”
said  Matthias Jasper , head of equities at WGZ Bank AG in
Dusseldorf, Germany. “I expect a really high ‘beat’ ratio
during the earnings season. The market has some upside potential
in the short term.”  
 The  DAX Index  rose 1.9 percent to 6,191.13 in Frankfurt,
the highest closing price in three weeks. The gauge has climbed
8.3 percent following the European Union’s May 10 unveiling of a
750 billion-euro ($921 billion) loan package aimed at stopping
the euro region’s weakest members from defaulting. The broader
 HDAX Index  also gained 1.9 percent today.  
 BMW surged 8.3 percent to 42.13 euros, the biggest gain in
15 months. The automaker now expects sales to rise about 10
percent to more than 1.4 million cars and sport-utility
vehicles, while the 2010 operating margin in the automotive
division will gain more than 5 percent.  Daimler AG , the second-
biggest maker of luxury cars, advanced 5.4 percent to 43.81
euros.  
 ThyssenKrupp Upgrade  
 ThyssenKrupp increased 3.5 percent to 22.26 euros after
being rated “buy” at Berenberg Bank.  
 “ThyssenKrupp, as a supplier of niche products, will be
able to pass on price increases to customers,” the brokerage
said in a note dated yesterday.  
 Infineon Technologies AG jumped 2.8 percent to 5.18 euros,
the highest close in three weeks. The German and Russian
governments are discussing AFK Sistema’s possible interest in
taking a stake in Infineon, a German government official told
reporters today in Berlin, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is holding talks in
Russia later this week.  
 Phoenix Solar AG rallied 7.1 percent to 35.53 euros after
the maker of solar-power equipment said it will sell as many as
670,200 shares to institutional investors at 32 euros apiece to
finance growth.  
 Rational AG  rose 2 percent to 129.45 euros as the German
maker of industrial ovens was raised to “buy” from “hold” at
Bankhaus Lampe KG.  
 Henkel dropped 1.2 percent to 38.32 euros, leading declines
in the DAX. The maker of Loctite glue and Persil detergent was
cut to “sell” from “buy” at Goldman Sachs.  
 The Mannheim-based ZEW Center for European Economic
Research said today its  index of investor and analyst
expectations , which aims to predict developments six months
ahead, fell to a 15-month low of 21.2 from 28.7 in June.
Economists had forecast a drop to 25.3, according to the median
of 34 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.
