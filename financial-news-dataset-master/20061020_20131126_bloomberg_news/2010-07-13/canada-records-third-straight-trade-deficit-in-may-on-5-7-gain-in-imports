             Canada reported a third straight
merchandise trade  deficit  in May, as imports of machinery and
equipment outpaced gains in exports, government figures showed.  
 The deficit of C$503 million ($487 million) was the largest
in eight months, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted that imports would
equal exports in May, according to the median of 21 estimates.
The agency also reduced its trade balance estimates back through
January.  
 Trade will shave 0.8 percentage point from Canada’s
economic growth rate this year, the Bank of Canada said in
April, leaving the overall expansion at 3.7 percent. Canada’s
trade balance has averaged a deficit of about C$250 million
since the start of last year, after the surplus peaked at C$5.7
billion in May 2008 before a global recession eroded shipments
of automobiles, lumber and energy.  
 “The Canadian economy could continue to outpace growth
elsewhere, so that could keep import growth above exports
keeping trade not only in a deficit position but implying a
further drag from net exports,” said  Paul Ferley , assistant
chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto.  
 The economy probably grew at a second-quarter annualized
pace of about 3 percent, Ferley said, because the rise in
imports suggests strength in consumer and business spending. The
International Monetary Fund said July 7 that Canada’s 3.6
percent growth this year will lead advanced economies.  
 Dollar Strengthens  
 The Canadian dollar gained 0.5 percent to C$1.0316 per U.S.
dollar at 9:47 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0372
yesterday. The currency reached C$1.0296 on July 9, the
strongest level since June 23. One Canadian dollar buys 96.94
U.S. cents.  
 Imports rose 5.7 percent to C$35 billion in May, Statistics
Canada said today. Machinery and equipment imports rose 6.6
percent to C$9.38 billion, and industrial goods and materials
imports gained 6.8 percent to C$7.3 billion. The volume of
imports rose 4.2 percent while prices grew 1.4 percent, the
report said.  
 Exports rose 5.2 percent to C$34.5 billion, with volumes
rising 3.9 percent and prices increasing 1.2 percent. More than
half of May’s gain came from a 21 percent jump in automotive
product shipments to C$5.43 billion. Within the autos category,
passenger vehicle shipments rose 28 percent to C$3.7 billion,
the highest since December 2006, on the “popularity of some
models manufactured in Canada,” the agency’s report said.  
 Slowing Growth  
 Canada’s trade surplus with the U.S., its largest trade
partner, widened to C$3.59 billion in May from C$3.46 billion
the prior month.  
 Statistics Canada today also changed its estimate of the
April trade balance to a deficit of C$330 million from the
originally reported surplus of C$175 million.  
 Other reports have suggested Canada’s economic growth
slowed in the second quarter from the decade-high pace of 6.1
percent recorded between January and March.  Building permits 
fell 10.8 percent in May and  gross domestic product  stalled in
April after seven previous gains.  
 Canada’s dollar has strengthened 11 percent against the
U.S. dollar over the past year, the fourth most among 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. A stronger currency can make
the country’s goods less competitive abroad.
