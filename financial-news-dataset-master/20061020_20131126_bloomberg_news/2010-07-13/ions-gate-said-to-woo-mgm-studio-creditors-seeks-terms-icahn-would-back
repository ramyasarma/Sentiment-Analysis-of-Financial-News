             Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. , the
independent film and TV producer, has approached creditors of
ailing  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.  to help shape a plan to acquire
the studio, two people with knowledge of the situation said.  
 Lions Gate Vice Chairman  Michael Burns  has been meeting in
New York with investors who hold some of MGM’s $3.7 billion
debt, according to the people, who requested anonymity because
the discussions are private.  
 Any agreement to buy Los Angeles-based MGM would have to be
approved by  Carl Icahn , Lions Gate’s largest shareholder. He
took a 10-day break from efforts to gain control of Vancouver-
based Lions Gate’s board so the company could make a case for
certain acquisitions. That standstill agreement expires on July
19. Debt-hobbled MGM is co-owner of the James Bond franchise.  
 Icahn, 74, who holds almost 38 percent of Lions Gate
 shares , isn’t a party to the talks, according to one person with
knowledge of Burns’s efforts. The billionaire investor
threatened a proxy fight to elect his own  board  at Lions Gate,
distributor of the “Saw” movies, after failing to gain a
majority of the stock with a $7-a-share takeover bid.  
 Icahn, who hasn’t publicly supported the idea of an MGM
merger, couldn’t be reached. Burns didn’t respond to a request
for comment.  Michael Utley , spokesman for Houlihan Lokey, the
investment bank advising MGM’s creditor committee, declined to
discuss the matter.  Susie Arons , an outside spokeswoman for MGM,
also declined comment.  
 The creditors, who formed a committee that represents MGM’s
100 or so debt holders, haven’t agreed on a unified position,
the people said.  
 Balance Sheet  
 The creditors’ lack of unity underscores the difficulty
Burns faces as he tries to craft a deal that will satisfy MGM’s
debt holders and Icahn, who has said he won’t approve a large
equity-for-debt swap that dilutes his holdings.  
 Peter Wilkes , a Lions Gate spokesman, said on July 9 the
studio “wouldn’t do a highly leveraged deal that added
significant debt to our balance sheet.”  
 Lions Gate, also the producer of the Emmy winning “Mad
Men” TV series, fell 17 cents to $6.53 in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . Shares of the company, run from
Santa Monica, California, have gained 12 percent this year.  
 MGM was put up for sale last year after falling behind on
its debts. Creditors have granted the studio several reprieves
on interest payments. The studio’s latest forbearance agreement
expires tomorrow.  
 The studio was taken private for $5 billion in 2005 by
buyers including Providence Equity Partners.
