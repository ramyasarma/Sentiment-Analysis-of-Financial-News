             Canadian stocks  fell after the U.S.
reported a larger-than-expected drop in retail sales and the
Federal Reserve trimmed its growth forecast for the year.  
 RIM, the BlackBerry maker, declined 0.9 percent after
failing to provide a time frame for the release of a new
operating system at its annual meeting. Ritchie Bros.
Auctioneers Inc. tumbled 9.3 percent on speculation the company
will reduce its forecasts for gross auction proceeds. Suncor
Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil and gas producer, slipped 0.8
percent as natural gas futures decreased.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  fell 17.92
points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,654.92 as of 3:28 p.m. in Toronto.  
 “Because we export a lot to the United States, Canada’s
going to be hugely influenced by the health of the U.S.
economy,” said  Murray Leith , who helps manage C$6.5 billion
($6.3 billion) as a money manager at Odlum Brown Ltd. in
Vancouver. “It just seems to be a very fickle, short-term-
oriented market, so the weak retail numbers give people an
excuse to sell.”  
 The S&P/TSX surged  5.2 percent  in the six days ending
yesterday as the country reported job growth five times the
median economist estimate and France’s Total SA agreed to buy
oil sands developer UTS Energy Corp. The index rallied 0.9
percent yesterday after Alcoa Inc. began the earnings-reporting
season by topping the average analyst estimate by 14 percent,
excluding certain items.  
 Retail sales retreated 0.5 percent in May, the U.S.
Commerce Department said today. Economists had forecast a loss
of 0.3 percent, according to the median of 75 economists’
estimates in a  Bloomberg survey .  
 Fed Minutes  
 North American stocks dropped further after minutes of last
month’s meeting of Fed officials said “the economic outlook had
softened somewhat.” The central bankers lowered their central
tendency forecast for 2010 growth to a range of 3 percent to 3.5
percent versus 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent in April.  
 Natural gas futures decreased 1.1 percent, while crude oil
lost earlier gains to settle at $76.79 a barrel, down 9 cents.  
 Suncor fell 0.8 percent to C$32.91 to contribute the most
to the  S&P/TSX’s loss . Talisman Energy Inc., an oil and gas
producer with operations in North America, the North Sea and
Indonesia, dropped 1.7 percent to C$16.61. Canadian Oil Sands
Trust, the largest owner of the Syncrude project, declined 1.3
percent to C$27.39.  
 Canada’s largest insurers, which all have operations in the
U.S., retreated. Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s
third-largest insurer, lost 0.9 percent to C$15.57.  
 U.S. Revenue  
 Great-West Lifeco Inc., Canada’s second-largest insurance
company, decreased 1.2 percent to C$24.78. Sun Life Financial
Inc., which got  47 percent  of its revenue from the U.S. last
year, slipped 0.7 percent to C$28.20.  
 RIM, Canada’s largest technology company, fell after
surging 11 percent in the previous three days, losing 0.9
percent to C$57. The company made no major announcements at its
annual meeting yesterday, and UBS AG analyst  Maynard J. Um  told
clients RIM provided “little clarity on timing & strategy” on
a new operating system.  
 Ritchie Bros., which calls itself the world’s largest
industrial auctioneer, sank 9.3 percent, the most in 13 months,
to C$19.33 after announcing a conference call to be held
tomorrow.  
 Raymond James Financial Inc. analyst  Ben Cherniavsky  told
clients in a note that he thinks the company will reduce its
forecast for 2010 gross auction proceeds. Analyst  Craig R. Kennison  of Robert W. Baird & Co. cut his 12-month price
estimate on the company’s U.S.-listed shares to $22 from $24,
citing the company’s announcement.  
 Alimentation Couche-Tard  
 Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., the owner of Mac’s and
Circle K convenience stories, retreated for the first time in
nine days, decreasing 3.1 percent to C$19.86. Analyst  Vishal Shreedhar  of UBS reduced his rating on the stock to “neutral”
from “buy,” citing recent share-price increases. Couche-Tard
had soared 15 percent this month through yesterday.  
 Money manager Sprott Inc. rallied 8.5 percent to C$3.58 and
earlier today surged as much as 14 percent, the most since 2008.
Cormark Securities Inc. President  Peter Grosskopf  will replace
company founder  Eric Sprott  as chief executive officer on Sept.
7, the company said yesterday.
