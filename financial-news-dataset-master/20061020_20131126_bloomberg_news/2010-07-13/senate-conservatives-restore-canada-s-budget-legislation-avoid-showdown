             Conservatives in Canada’s Senate
succeeded late tonight in restoring clauses in the legislation
implementing Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty’s  March budget that
were removed by a committee last week, avoiding a potential
showdown between the government and opposition parties.  
 The Senate Committee on  National Finance  last week proposed
changes to the government’s budget legislation, taking out
measures including those relating to government-owned Canada
Post and  Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.   
 The Senate voted 48 to 44 to defeat the changes, and then
passed the original legislation, Marc Roy, director of
communications for Liberal Senate Leader James Cowan, said in an
e-mail. The bill has now completed the legislative process and
can receive royal assent -- a formality -- at any time.  
 Had the Conservatives failed to win the vote, the amended
legislation could have been sent back to the House of Commons
for a new vote. The Conservative government lacks a majority of
Commons seats and budget bills are confidence matters, meaning
that a defeat in the Commons would have led to an election.  
 In the Senate, the governing Conservatives have 52  seats 
compared with 49 for the Liberals. There are two Progressive
Conservatives and two unaffiliated Senators.
