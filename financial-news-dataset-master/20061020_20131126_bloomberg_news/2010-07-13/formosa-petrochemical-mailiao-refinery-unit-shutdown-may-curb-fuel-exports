             Formosa Petrochemical Corp. ,
Taiwan’s only publicly traded oil refiner, shut a residue fluid
catalytic cracker yesterday because of an “equipment fault”
that will probably curb gasoline exports next month.  
 The No. 1 cracker, which processes fuel oil into light
products, may be closed for seven to 10 days, according to
Taipei-based spokesman  Lin Keh-yen . It has a capacity of 84,000
barrels a day, he said.  
 “Gasoline shipments may be affected and we will be
discussing with customers,” Lin said today by telephone.  
 Formosa’s refinery in Mailiao, western Taiwan, has a
capacity of 540,000 barrels of oil a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. On July 7, the company said it halted
operations at the No. 1 ethylene plant following a fire.
