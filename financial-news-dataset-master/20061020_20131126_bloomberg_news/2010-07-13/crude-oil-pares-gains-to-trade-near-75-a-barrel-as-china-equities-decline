             Crude oil fell for a second day in
New York after Chinese equities declined and as a stronger
dollar reduced the investment appeal of commodities.  
 Oil dropped below $75 a barrel in New York after China
quashed speculation that policy makers will relax measures aimed
at cooling the economy. The dollar rose against the euro for a
third day. U.S. gasoline inventories probably gained 350,000
barrels last week, poised for the third consecutive increase
after seven weeks of declines, according to analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News before a government report tomorrow.  
 “There seems to be more negative news that investors are
reacting to,” said  Serene Lim , a Singapore-based energy and
commodity strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. “Sentiment is a bit jittery, quite bearish, and oil prices
could reach the $67 to $72 a barrel range by the end of the
month.”  
 Crude for August delivery fell as much as 64 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $74.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $74.59 a barrel at 3:19 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract dropped $1.14 to $74.95,
the lowest close since July 7. Prices have declined 6.3 percent
this year.  
 The dollar traded at $1.2555 per euro at 2:59 p.m.
Singapore time, from $1.2596 in New York yesterday. The euro has
lost 1.1 percent since July 8. A stronger U.S. currency makes it
more expensive for investors to buy commodities priced in the
dollar.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.8 percent to
2,445.19 as of 12:30 p.m., the most since June 29. The CSI 300
Index fell 2 percent to 2,623.70.

 China’s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development
reiterated that it will maintain curbs on speculative purchases
and increase market supply. The statement was in response to
media reports that the nation may abandon its current property
policies, it said.  
 Brent crude for August settlement fell as much as 68 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $73.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, and traded at $74 at 3:22 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract dropped $1.05, or 1.4
percent, to $74.37.  
 “In the short term, there’s lot of headwinds against oil
to move significantly above the marginal cost, which we see at
$70 a barrel,” said  Neil Beveridge , an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein Ltd. in a Bloomberg Television interview in Hong Kong.  
 U.S. crude supplies probably fell last week as refiners are
expected to boost output and imports declined, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. Oil supplies probably dropped 1.35
million barrels in the seven days ended July 9, according to the
median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, probably climbed 800,000 barrels from
159.7 million, according to the survey. All of the respondents
forecast a gain.  
 The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.
