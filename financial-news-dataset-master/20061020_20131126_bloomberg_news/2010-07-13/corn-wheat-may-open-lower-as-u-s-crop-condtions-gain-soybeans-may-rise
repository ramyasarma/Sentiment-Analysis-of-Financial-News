             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade after the government said
U.S. crop conditions improved last week and  rains  this week will
end a dry spell in southern and eastern growing regions, said
 Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that increased Chinese purchases will
reduce U.S. inventories before this year’s harvest, which is
threatened by too much rain, Grow said. Soybean-meal futures may
open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to rise 0.05 cent to 0.1 cent a pound, he said.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on speculation that rain in parts of the U.S.,
Russia and elsewhere in Europe may boost global supplies, Grow
said.
