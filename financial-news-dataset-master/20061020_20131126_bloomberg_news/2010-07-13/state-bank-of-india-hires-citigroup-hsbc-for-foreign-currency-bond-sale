             State Bank of India , the nation’s
largest lender, plans to meet investors in Europe, Asia and the
U.S. from July 15 ahead of a potential dollar bond sale,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  
 The Mumbai-based bank’s London branch hired Bank of America
Corp., Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG to arrange the
meetings, the person said, asking not to be identified as the
talks are private.  
 State Bank aims sell about $1 billion of bonds, another
person familiar with the matter said on June 23. The bank will
seek to raise 200 billion rupees ($4.27 billion) from a share
sale in the second half of the year ending March 31 as demand
for loans climbs, it said last month.  
 Bond investor meetings are scheduled to start in London on
July 15 before bankers visit Frankfurt, Zurich, Los Angeles,
Boston, New York, Singapore and Hong Kong, the person said.  
 State Bank Chief Financial Officer S.S. Ranjan wasn’t
available for comment when Bloomberg called his office today.
