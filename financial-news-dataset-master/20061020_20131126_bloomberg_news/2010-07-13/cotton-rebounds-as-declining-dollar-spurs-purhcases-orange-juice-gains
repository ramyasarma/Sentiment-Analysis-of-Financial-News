             Cotton futures rebounded from a
five-month low as a decline in the dollar boosted the appeal of
some commodities as a hedge against inflation. Orange juice
gained.  
 The  greenback  fell to the lowest level in two months
against a basket of six currencies. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of 19 raw materials gained as much as 1.5 percent, as oil
jumped 2.9 percent and gold rallied. Yesterday, cotton dropped
1.6 percent, the most in a week.  
 “Cotton is in a recovery type of mode after yesterday’s
big down move,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price
Group Inc., a broker in Chicago. “We’re seeing one of those
better days when the dollar is down and crude oil is up pretty
good.”  
 Cotton for December delivery rose 0.86 cent, or 1.2
percent, to 74.65 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching 73.3 cents, the lowest price for a most-active
contract since Feb. 12.  
 Cotton has gained 19 percent in the past year, partly as
demand recovered.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 2.55
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $1.4165 a pound in New York.
Yesterday, the price fell to $1.3625, the lowest level since
June 8, before rallying.
