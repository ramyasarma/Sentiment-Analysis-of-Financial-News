             EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA , Greece’s
second-biggest bank, may collaborate with a partner to develop
its Polish business.  
 “It is now the right time for us to seek the incorporation
of Polbank EFG with its own Polish banking license,” Polbank
EFG Chief Executive Officer Kazimierz Stanczak said in an e-
mailed statement from Athens-based Eurobank today. The prospects
of Poland and its banking industry are “highly attractive,” he
said. Polbank is the Polish unit of Eurobank.  
 The Greek lender isn’t involved in discussion with any
particular party, the statement said.  Naftemporiki  newspaper
reported yesterday that Eurobank and HSBC Holdings Plc were
expected to announce an agreement to cooperate in the Polish
market. The report didn’t say where it got the information.  
 Eurobank rose 4.6 percent to 4.53 euros in Athens trading
today, advancing for a fourth straight day.  
 Eurobank, which has operated in Poland since 2006, aims to
double the size of its balance sheet in the country in the
medium term and set up a unit with a full Polish banking
license, it said in the statement.
