             Latin America will contribute about 
45 percent of profit this year for Banco Santander SA, up from 
36 percent in 2009, Francisco Luzon, head of the bank’s 
business in the region, said in an interview with El Pais.  
 Santander expects to buy banks in Colombia and Peru to 
boost its presence in the region, Luzon told the newspaper. 
Santander doesn’t plan for now to sell a stake in its Mexican 
business but doesn’t discount the possibility of doing so in 
the medium term, he said in the interview.
