             Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, began filming a Chinese version of
Latin American soap opera ``La Fea Mas Bella.''  
 The show is being produced in China and will air on Hunan
Satellite television starting in September, Mexico City-based
Televisa said in a statement today. The project, being made in
partnership with Hunan, Colombia's RCN Television and China's
Nesound, will cost $20 million, Televisa said.  
 Televisa is expanding production of its ``telenovelas''
outside  Latin America  in a bid to export its dominance in soap
operas. The Chinese soap opera is based on ``Betty la Fea,'' a
Colombian program re-made in Mexico last year and airing in the
U.S. as ``Ugly Betty'' on  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) 's ABC network.  
 The production is the first of several planned for China,
Televisa Vice President Jose Baston said in the statement.  
 The Chinese version will have 400 half-hour episodes, the
same as the Mexican program, the company said. Hunan Satellite
reaches almost 900 million viewers, the statement said.  
 Televisa has an estimated 70 percent market share of
viewers in Mexico, according to its October quarterly earnings
statement.  
 Televisa shares fell 1.8 percent to 52.25 pesos in Mexico
City  trading . The shares are little changed this year.
