             The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, responding as credit-rating companies are pressured
over flawed reviews of subprime mortgage bonds, proposed rules
to eliminate conflicts and help investors distinguish the
rankings of asset-backed securities from other debt.  
 The SEC also proposed today that raters such as Moody's
 Investors Service (MCO)  and Standard & Poor's Corp. be barred from
guiding investment banks on gaining top rankings for structured-finance offerings. The SEC will seek comment on recommending
that companies label asset-backed securities using different
symbols from the ratings on corporate and municipal debt.  
 ``All of the proposed rules that we are considering are
born of the subprime mortgage crisis and the resulting credit
crunch,'' SEC Chairman  Christopher Cox  said at a public  meeting 
in Washington today.  
 Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings are under fire
after the collapse of the subprime market exposed flaws in their
AAA rankings on mortgage bonds. The three companies are paid to
grade securities by underwriters who want to sell them,
prompting regulators and lawmakers to question their
independence.  
 The agency's three Republican commissioners voted to seek
comment for 30 days on the conflict-of-interest proposals. The
SEC staff typically incorporates changes based on the responses
before making the regulations binding. Commissioner  Paul Atkins 
opposed the recommendations on separate ratings symbols.  
 `Unnecessary Shock'  
 A new ratings scale may ``lead to the sudden sale of
structured-finance securities at fire-sale prices into an
already illiquid market,'' the Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association, Wall Street's biggest lobbying group, said
in a statement today. ``Financial markets can ill afford such an
unnecessary shock.''  
 The world's largest banks and securities firms have
absorbed almost $400 billion of losses and writedowns since the
start of 2007 after home loans made to the least creditworthy
borrowers started defaulting. Pension and money-market funds
also invested in mortgage bonds because the securities offered
higher returns than  government bonds  with the same AAA rankings.  
 The SEC recommended that Moody's, part of Moody's Corp.,
the S&P unit of McGraw-Hill Cos. and Fitch publicly disclose all
data that goes into their rankings so competitors can grade
bonds even if they weren't compensated by the underwriter.  
 `Independent Judgments'  
 ``Moody's appreciates the ongoing efforts undertaken by the
SEC and other policymakers to enhance transparency,'' spokesman
Tony Mirenda said. S&P looks ``forward to reviewing the proposed
rules,'' spokesman  Chris Atkins  said. ``Fitch agrees with the
commission that investors and other market participants should
make their own independent judgments of credit risk,'' the
company said in a statement.  
 Moody's fell $1.14, or 2.9 percent, to $38.45 at 4:15 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. McGraw-Hill
slipped 47 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $43.19.  
 To distinguish grades on securities made up of mortgages,
 car loans  and credit-card debt from corporate and municipal
bonds, the SEC proposal gives rating companies two choices.  
 One option is to publish a report on how they came up with
each ranking and how its risks differ from other types of debt.
SEC staff estimates it will cost each credit rater $4.37 million
on average every year to publish the reports.  
 The other option would force raters to add a designation to
their ranking symbols to show the security is an asset-backed
security. Moody's said in a February it may add ``.sf'' to
signify structured finance and S&P last month said it may add an
``s'' to rankings.  
 Phased In  
 Any requirement for different symbols likely would be
phased in to accommodate revisions to investment guidelines tied
to ratings, said  Erik Sirri , who heads the SEC division that
oversees credit-rating companies. The proposed rule is aimed at
forcing pension funds to reassess the risk of holding asset-backed securities, he said.  
 ``I hope a favorable consequence of this rule is that
people take a good, hard look at their investment policies,''
Sirri said at today's public meeting. ``It's wise always for
those responsible for investment decisions to understand the
risk and return characteristics'' of what they're buying.  
 Commissioner Atkins said such a change may have unintended
consequences, such as tainting asset-backed securities.  
 Other Proposals  
 Other agency proposals include more disclosure about how
well past rankings predicted the risk of default. Gifts from
investment banks to employees at credit rating companies would
be limited to $25 and Moody's, S&P and Fitch would have to
retain records of any complaints from underwriters.  
 ``The most important thing that they have included in the
proposal is some restrictions on conflicts of interest and some
restrictions on how analysts work with the issuers of these and
the banks that are putting forward these securities,'' said
Jason Pride, director of research at Haverford Trust Co., in a
Bloomberg television interview.  
 Under the agency's proposals, credit-ratings companies
would be banned from ranking a bond if they made recommendations
to underwriters about how to structure the security. Analysts at
credit raters would also be prohibited from discussing fees with
investment banks, the SEC said.  
 ``Selling consulting services to entities that purchased
ratings became a AAA conflict of interest,'' Cox said.  
 The SEC will hold another public meeting June 25 to
consider dropping references to credit ratings in its own rules.
The proposal would affect money-market funds that are required
by the SEC to buy short-term securities with the top rankings.
