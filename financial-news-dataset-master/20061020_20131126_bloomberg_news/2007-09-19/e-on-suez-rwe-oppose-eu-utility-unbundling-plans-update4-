             E.ON AG and  RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany 's two
biggest power producers, said a European Union proposal to curb
utilities' control over the region's energy grids would weaken
their market position and provide no boost to competition.  
 Suez SA, which plans to merge with Gaz de  France  SA to
create a 60 billion-euro ($84 billion) power and gas supplier,
said the proposals were ``useless.'' E.ON said the plans would
take the European market back to the era of state control before
the liberalization of the 1990s.  
 The European Commission, the executive arm of the 27-member
bloc, published draft legislation today that would force
electricity and gas producers to sell their transmission
networks or hand over management of the grids to an independent
operator to boost competition and create a single energy market.  
 ``Ownership unbundling won't achieve what the EU is
looking for, namely lower power prices, and it creates new
problems of its own,'' said  Theo Kitz , an analyst at Merck Finck
& Co. in Munich with a ``buy'' rating on E.ON shares. ``There
are better solutions out there.''  
 France's Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said the
country,  Europe 's second-biggest power market, opposed the
plans, while RWE said the proposals would discourage investment
and competition.  
 No Boost to Competition  
 ``The forced expropriation of power networks leads neither
to more competition, nor to higher investments,'' board member
Berthold Bonekamp said today in an e-mail. ``This is confirmed
by experience abroad.''  
 Bonekamp's remarks were reiterated Christian Drepper, a
spokesman for E.ON, in an e-mail. Separating networks ``doesn't
lead to lower prices,'' he added. Germany is Europe's biggest
energy market.  
 E.ON shares today rose 0.6 percent to close at 126.50 euros
in  Frankfurt , while RWE gained 0.5 percent to 85.72 euros.  
 The commission also plans to ban non-EU companies such as
 Russia 's OAO Gazprom, the world's biggest supplier of natural
gas, from controlling European networks in a bid to protect the
region's strategic interests. The proposal, applying only to new
investments, may also help expand EU access to markets abroad.  
 ``This is one salvo in a long-running battle in which
Russia is seeking markets and customers and Europe is seeking
diversity of supplies,'' said Matt Thomas, a London-based oil
and gas analyst at Morgan Stanley.  
 Gazprom Response  
 Gazprom, which supplies a quarter of Europe's gas, said it
would prepare a formal response to the commission's plan after
studying the proposals and holding talks with the ``relevant EU
bodies.''  
 Other European utilities supported the plans put forward by
the European Commission.  Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.'s biggest
utility, is expanding its European business and seeks greater
and cheaper access to power and gas grids in mainland Europe.  
 ``Ownership unbundling would be the best way of opening up
the closed shop that is the European energy market,'' Chief
Executive Officer Sam Laidlaw said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Vattenfall AB Chief Executive Officer Lars Josefsson also
backs the unbundling plan. He said the management of power and
gas grids should be handed over to an independent body,
Germany's Handelsblatt reported yesterday.  
 `Right Incentives'  
 Fulvio Conti, chief executive officer of  Enel SpA (ENEL) , agreed.  
 ``The most important thing in electricity is you have an
independent system operator and an independent regulator.'' A
single independent system operator may provide the right
incentives for investment, he said.  
 Timo Karttinen, senior vice president of development at
 Fortum Oyj (FUM1V) , the Nordic region's biggest utility after
Vattenfall, said the commission's proposal was necessary to
boost energy-market efficiency.  
 ``Unbundling is crucial for the functionality of the
 electricity market ,'' he said. ``The prerequisite of
independence is that no electricity producer or supplier has
controlling power'' in a network operator.  
 The proposals by the commission, based in Brussels, need
the support of national governments and the European Parliament
in a process that may take two years or more. The draft may
never become law because countries such as Germany and France
will probably oppose it, Neil Beddall, director of utility
credit research at  Barclays Capital  in  London , said today in a
note to investors.  
 France Voices Opposition  
 France's Lagarde said the country would try to block the
plan.  
 ``We will do everything we can with other opponents to
oppose any unbundling'' of utilities, she told commission
hearings on the planned merger between Gaz de France and Suez at
the National Assembly today.  
 Gaz de France operates Europe's biggest gas network.
 Electricite de France SA (EDF) , 87 percent-owned by the French
government, controls power-grid operator Reseau de Transport
d'Electricite, or RTE.  
 ``Separation of ownership isn't necessary to achieve a fair
European market,'' said Francois Molho, a spokesman for
Electricite de France. ``Through RTE we have demonstrated our
efficiency in ensuring competition and neutral, non-discriminatory access to the network for all electricity power
providers.''  
 Spokespeople from Gaz de France and Suez didn't return
calls seeking comment.
