             MBIA Inc. (MBI)  and  Ambac Financial Group
Inc. (ABKFQ)  rose after Calyon Securities recommended investors buy
shares of bond insurers because they are ``extremely cheap'' and
potential losses from subprime mortgages are ``manageable.''  
 ``Financial guarantors will emerge from the problems that
plague the subprime mortgage market relatively unscathed, if not
entirely unscathed,'' analysts led by Harry Fong wrote in a
research note. ``All the guarantors are trading at a deep
discount.''  
 Bond insurers have slumped this year on concern they might
lose money from securities backed by subprime mortgages that they
guarantee. MBIA, the world's largest bond insurer, fell 15
percent in 2007 through yesterday. Ambac, the second biggest,
declined 27 percent.  
 The Calyon analysts also recommended  Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) 
and Security Capital Assurance Ltd. The insurers don't have
funding issues and can delay payments for years under a worse-
case scenario, they wrote.  
 MBIA has the ``least exposure'' to subprime mortgages, while
Ambac and Security Capital have the most, according to the
analysts.  
 MBIA climbed $2.52, or 4.1 percent, to $64.16 as of 4 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. Ambac rose $3.60,
or 5.5 percent, to $68.85.  Assured Guaranty  gained $2.76, or 11
percent, to $28.56. Security Capital advanced $1.12, or 5.3
percent, to $22.44.
