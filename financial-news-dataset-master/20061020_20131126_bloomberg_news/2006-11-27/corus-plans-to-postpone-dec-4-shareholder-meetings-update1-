             Corus Group Plc, the subject of a
takeover battle between  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  and  Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA (CSNA3) , plans to delay shareholder meetings set for Dec. 4
to allow CSN more time to prepare a formal offer.  
 Corus will propose to shareholders at the Dec. 4 meeting to
adjourn the extraordinary general meeting and court meeting until
Dec. 20, the London-based steelmaker said today in a statement.  
 ``The  board  want to be seen as doing the right thing for the
shareholders, and that has to allow CSN a full look at their
books,'' said Stephen Pope, head of equity research at Cantor
Fitzgerald LP in London.  
 CSN, based in Rio de Janeiro, offered Corus shareholders
475 pence a share on Nov. 17, subject to due diligence. Mumbai-
based Tata Steel made a bid on Oct. 20, without such conditions.  
 CSN's proposal valued Corus, the former British Steel Plc,
at $8 billion. Tata's offer of 455 pence was rejected by Standard
Life Plc, Corus's biggest shareholder, as too low.  
 Shares of Corus fell 4.5 pence, or 0.9 percent, to 500.5
pence at 11:43 a.m. in  London , having fallen as much as 1.5
percent to 497.25 pence.
