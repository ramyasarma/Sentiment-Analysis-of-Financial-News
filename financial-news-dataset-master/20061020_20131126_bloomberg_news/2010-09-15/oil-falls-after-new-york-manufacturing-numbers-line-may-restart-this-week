             Oil fell for a third day in New
York after a U.S. government report showed fuel demand declined
last week and as Enbridge Energy Partners LP prepared to start a
pipeline after repairs, easing supply concerns.  
 Crude dropped after the Energy Department said gasoline
demand tumbled 2.6 percent to 9 million barrels a day, the
lowest rate since the week ended March 12. Enbridge said it will
start preparations to flow oil through a pipeline linking Canada
and refineries in the U.S. Midwest early tomorrow. Manufacturing
in the New York area expanded slower than forecast, signaling
economic growth may falter.  
 “We’re not seeing as much consumption as we thought,”
said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director at Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney. “There is an oversupply of oil.”  
 Crude for October delivery fell as much as $1.02, or 1.3
percent, to $75 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. It was at $75.24 at 2:45 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, the contract slipped 78 cents, or 1 percent, to
$76.02. Futures have declined 5.2 percent this year.  
 Prices fell after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s
general economic index slumped to 4.1 this month, the lowest
since July 2009, from 7.1 in August. Economists expected the
reading to climb to 8, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Houston-based Enbridge won’t restart its Line 6A until the
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is
satisfied with the company’s repair and safety plans,
administration spokesman Damon Hill said in an e-mail.  
 Midwest Imports  
 Oil topped $78 a barrel this week, a one-month high, after
the Enbridge pipeline was shut Sept. 9 because of the leak at
Romeoville, Illinois. It can carry 670,000 barrels a day of
crude, more than one-third of U.S. Midwest imports. Gasoline in
the Chicago spot market rose as much as 10 percent amid
speculation refiners would cut output, tightening supply.  
 U.S.  fuel demand  slipped 1 percent to 19.5 million barrels
a day last week, according to the Energy Department. Crude
stockpiles dropped 2.49 million barrels to 357.4 million, the
report showed. That matched the median 2.5 million-barrel
drawdown estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.
Supplies were 13 percent higher than the five-year average level.  
 Gasoline inventories decreased by 694,000 barrels to 224.5
million last week as  imports fell  to a five-month low and
refinery output declined, the department said. Stockpiles of
distillate fuel, including heating oil and diesel, were down
340,000 barrels at 174.5 million.  
 Tropical Storm Karl  
 Tropical Storm Karl crossed Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula into
the Gulf of Mexico and is forecast to strengthen to a  hurricane 
by tomorrow, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an
advisory.  
 Hurricane Igor, packing maximum sustained winds of 135
miles (217 kilometers) per hour, moved west-northwest toward
Bermuda. The Category 4 storm is the second strongest on the
five-step  Saffir-Simpson scale . To the east, Hurricane Julia
weakened to Category 3 and isn’t expected to threaten land.  
 Brent crude for November settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange dropped 53 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$78.89 a barrel. The October contract declined 0.3 percent to
$78.91 yesterday, when it expired.
