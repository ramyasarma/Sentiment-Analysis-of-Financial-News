             OAO Rosneft (ROSN) ,  Russia 's biggest oil
producer, increased a loan to $3.425 billion to refinance debt,
a banker involved in the deal said.  
 The company borrowed an additional $425 million on the loan
it raised in February, said the banker, who didn't want to be
identified because the transaction is private. Rosneft is paying
interest of 0.95 percentage point more than interbank borrowing
rates for the five-year loan, Bloomberg data show.  
 ``In the current situation Rosneft's borrowing costs are
much better than most other Russian companies would have been
able to get,'' said Dmitry Sentchoukov, an emerging market
strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in  London .  
 Russia's economy, buoyed by record oil, natural gas and
metals prices, hasn't escaped the credit crisis triggered by the
U.S. housing slump. Moscow-based Rosneft abandoned a planned
bond sale in July as losses and writedowns linked to  subprime 
mortgages caused investors to shun all but the safest government
debt.  
 Rosneft borrowed $22 billion in March last year to fund the
acquisition of assets from OAO Yukos Oil Co. The company paid
interest of between 0.25 percentage point and 0.5 percentage
point more than benchmark rates on the 12-month bridge loans.  
 The company's outstanding debt was about $23.8 billion on
March 31, the company said in a statement this week.  
 Deutsche Bank AG led a group of 22 banks arranging the new
borrowing, which was increased to $3 billion from $2 billion in
February.
