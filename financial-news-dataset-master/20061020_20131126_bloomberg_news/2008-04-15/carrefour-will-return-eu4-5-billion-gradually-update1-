             Carrefour SA (CA) , the world's second-largest retailer, will return 4.5 billion euros ($7.1 billion)
to shareholders ``gradually'' and hasn't ruled out a special
dividend, Chief Executive Officer Jose Luis Duran said.  
 The CEO also confirmed Carrefour's goal for sales growth of
6 percent to 8 percent this year excluding currency movements.
He spoke today at the Paris-based company's annual meeting.  
 Duran last week said profit would grow faster than the 6
percent to 8 percent goal, though the retailer later said there
was a ``misinterpretation'' of the wording of his speech. He
also said April 9 that soaring costs were outpacing price
increases across the retail industry, sending the stock down
the most in two months in Paris.  
 Carrefour rose as much as 70 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 47.20
euros in Paris trading, and was at 46.80 euros as of 1:05 p.m.
local time. The  stock  has declined 12 percent this year, reducing
the company's market value to about 33 billion euros.  
 Duran also said today that Carrefour expects international
operations to account for 60 percent of sales and operating
profit in 2010. Emerging markets are expected to represent 33
percent of revenue and 30 percent of profit by then, he added.  
 Blue Capital, an investment company owned jointly by
 Bernard Arnault  and Colony Capital LLC, will probably seek to
increase its 10.7 percent  stake  in Carrefour, though doesn't
plan to take control, Colony Europe director Sebastien Bazin
said in an interview today.
