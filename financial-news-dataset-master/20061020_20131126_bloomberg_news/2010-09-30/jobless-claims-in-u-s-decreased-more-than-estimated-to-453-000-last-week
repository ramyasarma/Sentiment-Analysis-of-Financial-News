Applications for U.S. unemployment
benefits decreased last week, a sign companies are cutting back
on firings even as economic growth slows.  Initial  jobless claims  decreased by 16,000 to 453,000 in
the week ended Sept. 25, lower than the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, Labor Department figures
showed today in Washington. The total number of people receiving
unemployment insurance and those getting extended payments fell.  As dismissals abate, employers also aren’t adding enough
workers to reduce an  unemployment rate  that’s hovering near a
26-year high. A lack of job growth suggests consumer spending,
the biggest part of the economy, will be slow to pick up in
coming months.  “Employers are still kind of cautious,” said Russell
Price, a senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Inc. in
Detroit, who forecasted claims would fall to 455,000. “We need
to regain that broader momentum in the economy, and something
like that is just slow to develop.”  The world’s largest economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual
rate in the second quarter, marking the start of a slowdown in
growth that has concerned the Federal Reserve, revised figures
from the Commerce Department also showed today.  The revised increase in gross domestic product exceeded the
median forecast of economists surveyed, which projected a
reading of 1.6 percent, unchanged from the government’s estimate
issued last month. GDP grew 3.7 percent in the first three
months of the year and 5 percent at the end of 2009.  Futures Rebound  Stock-index futures climbed after the reports, erasing
earlier losses. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rose 0.3 percent to 1,144 at 8:47 a.m. in New York. Treasury
securities also advanced, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-
year note down to 2.47 percent from 2.51 percent late yesterday.  Claims were projected to fall to 460,000, according to the
 median forecast  of 47 economists in the Bloomberg survey.
Estimates ranged from 450,000 to 475,000. The Labor Department
revised the prior week’s figure to 469,000 from 465,000.  The  four-week  moving average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly figures, dropped to 458,000 last week from 464,250,
today’s report showed.  The number of people  continuing  to receive jobless benefits
fell by 83,000 in the week ended Sept. 18 to 4.46 million.  Smaller Benefit Rolls  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended and emergency benefits under
federal programs. Those who’ve used up their traditional
benefits and are now collecting  emergency  and extended payments
decreased by about 293,000 to 4.88 million in the week ended
Sept. 11.  The unemployment  rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 3.5 percent in
the week ended Sept. 18 from 3.6 percent the prior week.  Forty-four states and territories reported an increase in
claims, led by a 15,000 jump in California as government offices
returned to a five-day work week following a holiday-shortened
schedule the prior week. Nine states reported a decrease in the
week ended Sept. 18.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  More Unemployment  Private employers in August added 67,000 workers while
total payrolls fell by 54,000, the Labor Department said earlier
this month. Unemployment rose to 9.6 percent last month, and
economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast joblessness will stay
near that level for the rest of the year.  The economy is a top issue for voters in the November
congressional elections, and polls show the public is
increasingly skeptical of President Barack Obama’s performance.
Earlier this week Obama signed legislation yesterday that will
cut taxes and provide credit help for small businesses, calling
it an essential step for job growth in a slow economy.  Some companies are still firing workers while others are
hiring on a short-term basis.  Toys ‘R’ Us Inc. , the world’s biggest toy retailer, plans
to hire about 45,000 employees to cope with demand during the
holiday season. The move is “essentially doubling” the
domestic workforce, Wayne, New Jersey-based Toys ‘R’ Us said in
a Sept. 28 statement.  Textron Inc. , based in Providence, Rhode Island, said it
plans to cut 700 jobs at its Cessna plane division, as the
aircraft maker reduces production further because demand hasn’t
yet picked up after the recession. The cuts represent about 8.3
percent of the unit’s workforce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
