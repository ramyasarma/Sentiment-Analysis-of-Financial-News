Sudan signed seven agreements for
gold mining in the country’s central area, including one with
state-owned Dubai World of the United Arab Emirates, and an
accord for the extraction of iron, the Mining Ministry said.  Six of the gold-mining agreements for work in Northern
Kordofan state are with Sudanese companies, the ministry said in
a statement handed to reporters today in the capital, Khartoum.
Sudan-based Heglig Co. will carry out mining extraction in Red
Sea state, in northeastern Sudan, according to the statement.  A spokesman for Dubai World couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment.  Northern Sudan must diversify its economy, and develop
agriculture and industries such as gold mining and ethanol
production, to decrease its dependency on oil, Central Bank
Governor Sabir al-Hassan said June 9.  Sudan is sub-Saharan Africa’s third-biggest crude producer,
pumping about 490,000 barrels a day, according to the BP
Statistical Review of World Energy. Most of the crude is pumped
in southern Sudan, which will vote in a January referendum on
whether to secede and form an independent country.  The vote is a key component of a 2005 peace agreement,
which ended a two-decade civil war between Sudan’s Muslim north
and the south, where Christianity and animist beliefs dominate.  Sudan’s north and south haven’t agreed on post-referendum
arrangements such as how to share the nation’s oil wealth. The
regions now split the proceeds from oil pumped in the south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
