China’s new Law on Guiding State
Secrets, with a clear definition of protected material, will
come into effect today, Xinhua News Agency said, citing the text
of the legislation.  The new rules will make it more difficult for local
officials to avoid answering questions using secrecy as an
excuse, and will eliminate random classification of information
as secret, the news agency reported.  Still, the new law requires Internet service providers and
other public information networks to cooperate with
investigations into probes of leaks, Xinhua said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
