Lyttelton Port Co. Ltd. , which
operates near Christchurch on New Zealand’s South Island, has
ceased merger talks with  Port Otago Ltd.  to focus on repairing
damage from an earthquake last month.  The port suffered damage to its wharves, cranes and other
facilities when a 7 magnitude earthquake struck the region on
Sept. 4. Given the magnitude and priority of the recovery work,
it is not possible to continue merger negotiations, the company
said in a regulatory filing.  Lyttelton, the largest container terminal on New Zealand’s
South Island, has been in talks with its Dunedin-based rival for
almost two years to avoid duplicating investment in rail
services and cranes as shipping companies deploy larger vessels
and reduce visits to the country’s smaller ports. The company
must now focus on development and asset management plans, it
said today.  “The landscape has changed significantly,” said Deputy
Chairman  Bill Luff . “Given this situation, it is only fair and
prudent to cease the merger negotiations in order to allow the
full resources of Lyttelton Port to focus on both running the
port and undertaking the recovery and rebuild project.”  It will cost more than NZ$50 million ($37 million) to
repair infrastructure including wharves, the Press newspaper
reported on Sept. 14, citing estimates provided by Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Davie .  Lyttelton  shares  were untraded as at 11 a.m. in Wellington.  To contact the reporter for this story:
