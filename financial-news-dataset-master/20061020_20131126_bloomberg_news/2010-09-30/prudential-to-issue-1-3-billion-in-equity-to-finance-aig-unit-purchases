Prudential Financial Inc. , the
second-largest U.S. life insurer, plans to issue $1.3 billion in
equity to help fund the purchase of two Japan units.  Prudential will also use about $1.7 billion of available
capital and $1.2 billion of debt, the Newark, New Jersey-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. In addition to the
$4.2 billion cash portion, the company will assume about $600
million in third-party debt, Prudential said.  The insurer, led by Chief Executive Officer  John Strangfeld , is buying AIG Star Life Insurance Co. and AIG Edison
Life Insurance Co. from American International Group Inc. to
expand in Japan. Prudential expects pretax integration expenses
of $500 million over five years and annual savings of $250
million, according to the filing.  “The addition of these operations to our existing
businesses in Japan will increase our presence” in the country,
Strangfeld said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
