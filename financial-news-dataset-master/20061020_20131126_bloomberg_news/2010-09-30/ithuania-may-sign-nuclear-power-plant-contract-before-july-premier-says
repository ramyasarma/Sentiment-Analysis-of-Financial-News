Lithuania wants to sign in the
first half of next year with the winner of a contract to build a
nuclear power plant in the country, Prime Minister  Andrius Kubilius  said.  By “the end of November we’ll know the bids,” Kubilius
said in an interview in Copenhagen yesterday. “We plan to
finalize agreements in the first half of next year. I’m quite
confident that we’ll see a positive outcome.”  The government wants to replace the Soviet-made Ignalina
facility that was shut in December to comply with European Union
rules. It invited binding offers to build the power plant to
reduce the Baltic nation’s dependence on Russian energy.  Lithuania, which imports almost 50 percent of electricity
supplies, wants to complete the nuclear plant in  Visaginas 
between 2018 and 2020.  The government in February shortlisted five companies it
declined to name to invest in and build the power station, which
may cost as much as 5 billion euros ($6.8 billion).  Iberdrola
SA , Spain’s largest electricity supplier, in May said it was one
of the finalists.  -- Editors:  Balazs Penz ,  Leon Mangasarian .  To contact the reporters on this story:
