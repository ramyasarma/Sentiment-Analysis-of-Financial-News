Spain’s  economy  may have
deteriorated in the third quarter as stimulus measures came to
an end, the Bank of Spain said.  The data available for July and August suggest “activity
may have weakened,” the Bank of Spain said in its monthly
bulletin in Madrid today. The end of car-purchase incentives
over the summer and a value-added tax increase that encouraged
consumers to make purchases before the July 1 start date
contributed to the slowdown, the central bank said.  Spain’s economy emerged from an almost two-year recession
in the first half of the year, growing 0.1 percent in the first
quarter and 0.2 percent in the second. Finance Minister Elena
Salgado has said she doesn’t expect any negative quarters this
year, even as she forecasts a full-year contraction of 0.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
