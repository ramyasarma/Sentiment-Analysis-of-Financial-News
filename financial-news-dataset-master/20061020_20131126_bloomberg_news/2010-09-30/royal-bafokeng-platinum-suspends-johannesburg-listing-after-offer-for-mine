Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd.
suspended the listing of its stock on Johannesburg’s stock
exchange after the company’s shareholders received an
unsolicited bid for its Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine, the
mining company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The company’s board “has taken the decision to put the
intended listing process on hold in order to allow the
shareholders an appropriate period to evaluate the offer,” it
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
