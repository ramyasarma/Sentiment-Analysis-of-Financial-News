The European Commission said it
will take legal action against Poland, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia,
Hungary and Slovakia over targets for renewable energy.  The commission, the European Union regulator in Brussels,
sent the six countries letters of formal notice to submit
their National Renewable Energy Action Plans to ensure that
renewable-energy targets are met, Marlene Holzer, a spokeswoman
for EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger, told reporters
today in Brussels.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
