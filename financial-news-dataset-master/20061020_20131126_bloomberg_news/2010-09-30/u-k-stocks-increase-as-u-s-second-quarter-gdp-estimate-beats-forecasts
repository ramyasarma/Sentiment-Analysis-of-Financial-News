U.K. stocks advanced, erasing
earlier losses after the U.S. Commerce Department unexpectedly

at an annual rate.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index added 0.4 percent to 5,591.52
at 1:37 p.m. in London after earlier falling as much as 0.4
percent.  The shares of Man Group Plc and Eurasian Natural Resources
