Peru will increase reserve
requirements for lenders beginning Oct. 1 to temper surging
growth in credit, the central bank said today.  The minimum legal reserve mandate will rise to 9 percent of
lenders’ loan portfolios from 8.5 percent, for both soles and
foreign currency, the bank said in an e-mailed statement. The
marginal requirement will rise to 25 percent from 15 percent for
soles and to 55 percent from 50 percent for foreign currency.  The central bank has raised its  benchmark lending rate  and
reserve requirements five times each since May as policy makers
said a stronger-than-expected rebound in domestic demand
threatened to spark  inflationary pressures . Bank lending rose 19
percent last month from a year earlier, the fastest annual
growth since April 2009, bank association Asbanc said last week.  “With the increase in the reference rate and reserve
requirements the central bank is withdrawing monetary stimulus
to achieve its inflation target,” the central bank said.  Annual inflation may accelerate 2.5 percent to 3 percent
this year, from 2.3 percent in August, putting it close to the
upper end of the bank’s target range of 1 percent to 3 percent,
the bank said this month.  Last month, policy makers raised the marginal reserve
requirement for foreign banks to 120 percent of their short-term
sol deposits in the Andean country, to deter speculative capital
inflows after the sol surged to a two-year high.  The sol has gained 12 percent against the U.S. dollar since
the end of 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
