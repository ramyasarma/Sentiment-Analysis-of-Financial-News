American International Group Inc. ,
recipient of a bailout valued at $182.3 billion, agreed to sell
two Japanese life insurers to  Prudential Financial Inc.  as it
raises funds to repay the U.S. government.  Prudential, the second-largest U.S. life insurer, agreed to
pay $4.8 billion for AIG Star Life Insurance Co. and AIG Edison
Life Insurance Co., AIG said in a statement yesterday.  The following is a timeline showing milestones in New York-
based AIG’s business in Japan.  April 1, 1998: GE Capital Edison Life Insurance Co., based in
Tokyo, begins operations. It is a joint venture between General
Electric Co. and Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co., a Japanese
company beset by policy cancellations.  1999: Japan’s insurers struggle to pay investors amid declining
interest rates and reduced returns on assets.  April 20, 2001: AIG wins approval to buy bankrupt Chiyoda Mutual
Life Insurance Co. and renames the business AIG Star Life
Insurance Co.  April 1, 2002: GE Edison buys Saison Life Insurance Co. from
Credit Saison Co. and other Saison group members.  June 26, 2003: AIG agrees to buy GE Edison, as well as General
Electric car and home units in the U.S., for $2.15 billion. AIG
changes GE Edison’s name to AIG Edison Life Insurance Co.  May 2006: AIG announces plans to merge Star Life and Edison
Life. The merger never takes place.  Dec. 5, 2007: Writedowns tied to home loans are “manageable,”
AIG’s then-Chief Executive Officer  Martin Sullivan  says on a
conference call when investors question him on subprime mortgage
bets. The event was held to tout non-U.S. life units.  Sept. 16, 2008: AIG accepts an $85 billion loan from the Federal
Reserve and agrees to hand over majority control to the U.S. to
stave off a collapse as mortgage bets drained capital and
resulted in a credit-rating cut.  Oct. 3, 2008: AIG plans to sell its life-insurance operations in
the U.S., Europe, Latin America, South Asia and Japan, then-CEO
 Edward Liddy  says in a conference call.  Feb. 24, 2009: Liddy reconsiders the asset sales amid
disappointing bids, say two people familiar with the matter.  July 16, 2009: Prudential, a previous bidder, resumes talks with
AIG about purchase of the two Japanese insurance units.  Oct 30, 2009: AIG says it will keep Star and Edison because of
their possibility for growth, suspending talks with Prudential.  Sept. 21, 2010: AIG moves forward with plans for an initial
public offering in Hong Kong of AIA Group Ltd., its main Asia
unit.  Sept. 30, 2010: Prudential agrees to buy Star and Edison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
