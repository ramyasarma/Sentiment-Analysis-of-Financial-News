MasterCard Inc. , the world’s
second-biggest electronic payments network, said it has acquired
a 12.5 percent stake in Indian software-services provider
ElectraCard Services.  The investment in Pune-based ECS, which provides processing
services and software for credit and debit cards, will help
MasterCard expand its reach in Asia, the Middle East and Africa,
the Purchase, New York-based company said today in a statement.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  MasterCard and larger rival  Visa Inc.  are expanding their
global processing capabilities as alternative payment providers
including  EBay Inc. ’s PayPal seek to gain market share.
MasterCard said last month that it had agreed to buy  DataCash
Group Plc  to expand its e-commerce offerings. In July, Visa
completed its acquisition of CyberSource Corp., which helps
merchants accept online payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
