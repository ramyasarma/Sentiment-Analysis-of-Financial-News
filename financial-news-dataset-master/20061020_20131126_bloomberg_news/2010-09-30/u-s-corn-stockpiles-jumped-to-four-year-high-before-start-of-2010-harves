Corn inventories  in the U.S., the
world’s biggest grower and exporter, are up 2 percent from  a
year earlier and the highest since 2006 as farmers began to
harvest this year’s crop, a government report showed.  Stockpiles on Sept. 1 totaled 1.708 billion bushels, up
from 1.673 billion a year earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a report. Analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey expected 1.407 billion, on average. Corn usage in the
three months ended Aug. 31 was 2.6 billion bushels, up from 2.59
billion a year earlier, the USDA said.  “USDA found 300 million bushels more than people were
expecting and that is a negative surprise,” said  Jerry Gidel , a
market analyst for North American Risk Management Services Inc.
in Chicago. “The larger reserves may be offset by expectations
for a smaller crop” that farmers began harvesting earlier this
month, Gidel said.  Corn futures had surged 36 percent in the past three months
on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly on concern that flooding
damaged crops before the harvest. The USDA earlier this month
predicted a  record crop  of 13.16 billion bushels (334.3 million
metric tons), up 0.4 percent from last year. The government will
update its forecast on Oct. 8.  An estimated 27 percent of the crop was collected as of
Sept. 26, up from 18 percent a week earlier and the previous
five-year average of 15 percent, the USDA said this week. Mostly
dry weather will aid harvesting the next two weeks, T-Storm
Weather LLC said yesterday.  Rising Prices  Corn futures for December delivery rose 5 cents, or 1
percent, to close $5.05 a bushel yesterday on the CBOT. On Sept.
27, the most-active contract reached $5.2875, the highest price
since September 2008.  “The biggest price factor for corn over the next month
will be the size of the upcoming harvest,” said  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.
“As prices have moved up, that will lead to slowing demand for
corn.”  Soybean inventories  on Sept. 1 totaled 151 million bushels,
up from 150 million estimated on Sept. 10 and the 138 million
bushels on hand a year earlier, the USDA said. The average
analyst estimate was 151 million bushels.  Consumption of the oilseed in the final quarter of the
marketing year that ended Aug. 31 fell to 420 million bushels
from 458 million in the year-earlier period, the USDA said.  Price Rally  Soybean futures for November delivery declined 11 cents, or
1 percent, to settle at $10.99 a bushel yesterday on the CBOT.
On Sept. 27, the price touched $11.44, the highest level since
June 2009. Before today, soybeans jumped 22 percent since the
end of June as hot, dry weather threatened U.S. yields and
delayed planting in Brazil and Argentina.  The U.S. harvest will total a record 3.483 billion bushels,
up 3.7 percent from 2009, the USDA said in a Sept. 10 report.
The agency will update its forecast next week.  “The U.S. soybean crop is going to be huge this year, so
the carryover supplies are not meaningful,” said  Dale Durchholz , the senior analyst for AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,
Illinois. “The focus is clearly shifting to the weather
forecasts in South America,” where soil moisture will get a
boost from rains next week, Durchholz said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $47.4 billion in
2008, followed by soybeans at $27.4 billion, government data
show. The U.S. is the world’s largest producer and exporter of
soybeans, followed by Brazil and Argentina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
