Chrysler Group LLC Chief Executive
Officer Sergio Marchionne said financial performance next year
at the automaker run by Fiat SpA will justify an initial public
offering in the second half.  “2011 is bound to be a profitable year and financial
performance will justify a good IPO in the second half,”
Marchionne told Bloomberg Television today at the Paris Motor
Show, adding that he will remain CEO of both carmakers after
Chrysler’s IPO.  “We are in the process of finalizing the third quarter,”
he said. “We are probably a big chunk of the year ahead
compared to the plan we presented in term of performances.”  Marchionne also said today that he’s aiming to have 50,000
of the 500 model to be sold in the U.S. in 2011.       To contact the reporter on this story:
