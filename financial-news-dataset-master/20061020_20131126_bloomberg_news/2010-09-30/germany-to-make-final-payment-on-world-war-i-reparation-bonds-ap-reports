Germany will make its last payment
on Oct. 3 for bonds issued after World War I to pay for
reparations and strengthen the economy, the Associated Press
reported.  Payment on the bonds, suspended during the Nazi era, was
rescheduled under a 1953 international agreement, the news
service said.  Payment on about 150 million euros ($205 million) due
didn’t resume until after German reunification, AP said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
