-- Gold production in Mexico rose
to a four-month high in July after a new mine ramped up
production, the National Statistics Agency said.  Mexico’s gold output jumped 46 percent to 5,850 kilograms
(12,897 pounds) from 4,016 kilograms in the year-ago period, the
agency said today in a statement on its  website .  Goldcorp Inc. , the world’s second-largest producer of the
metal by market value, is accelerating production at its
Penasquito mine, located in the Mexican state of Zacatecas.
Penasquito, which is scheduled to reach full capacity in 2011,
is “on track to meet 2010 gold production guidance of 180,000
ounces,” the company said in a Sept. 12 statement.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $11, or 0.8
percent, to $1,299.30 an ounce at 11:35 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Before today, the metal was up 4.8 percent this month and
5.2 percent in the third quarter.  Copper production rose 13 percent to 20,064 metric tons,
while silver output gained 12 percent to 289,541 kilograms, the
agency said.  Overall mining production in Mexico fell 0.3 percent in
July from the previous year after gains by precious metals were
offset by a 40 percent drop in non-coking coal.  Barrick Gold Corp.,  based in Toronto, is the world’s
largest gold miner ranked by market capitalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
