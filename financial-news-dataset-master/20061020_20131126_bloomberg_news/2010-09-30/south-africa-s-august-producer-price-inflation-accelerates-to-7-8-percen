The cost of goods leaving South
African factories and mines rose at a faster pace in August than
the previous month, reducing the chance of another interest rate
cut this year.  Producer prices increased an annual 7.8 percent after
gaining 7.7 percent in July, Pretoria-based  Statistics South
Africa  said on its website today. The  median estimate  of 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.6 percent. Prices rose
0.4 percent in the month.  The Reserve Bank lowered its benchmark interest  rate  by
half a percentage point to 6 percent on Sept. 9, the eighth
reduction since December 2008, as consumer-price inflation
remained within the 3 percent to 6 percent target range. With
producer costs rising and consumer spending recovering, the
central bank may see less need to cut interest rates again.  “Producer inflation surprised on the upside,”  Carmen Altenkirch , an economist at Nedbank Group Ltd., said in a note
to clients. “Interest rates are expected to remain unchanged at
the next meeting.”  The rand was at 6.9625 against the dollar, little changed
from 6.9677 before the data was released. The yield on the R157
government bond, due 2015, rose 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.22 percent.  Retail Sales  Credit growth  accelerated to an annual 3 percent in August
from 2 percent the month before, the Reserve Bank said in a
report earlier today.  Retail sales  jumped an annual 7.9 percent
in July, the statistics office said on Sept. 22.  The rand’s 9.8 percent surge against the dollar this
quarter has cut import prices and helped offset rising costs.
Consumer-price  inflation  slowed to an annual 3.5 percent in
August from 3.7 percent the month before, the statistics office
said yesterday.  Reserve Bank Governor  Gill Marcus  said after this month’s
rate cut that there was “limited” scope for further reductions
as the economy recovers. The bank expects gross domestic product
to expand 2.8 percent this year, compared with a contraction of
1.8 percent in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
