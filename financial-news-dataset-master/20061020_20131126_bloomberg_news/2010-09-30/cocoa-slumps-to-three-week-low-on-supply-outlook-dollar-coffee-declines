Cocoa futures fell the most in
three weeks amid signs of rising supplies and as the dollar
gained, lowering the appeal of commodities as alternative
assets. Coffee also declined.  Cocoa exports from  Cameroon , the world’s fifth-biggest
producer, climbed 18 percent last month, the Cocoa and Coffee
Interprofessional Board said today. The dollar rose as much as
0.5 percent against the euro, after U.S. jobless claims
unexpectedly fell and a Chicago purchasing managers survey was
stronger than forecast.  “The fundamentals are bearish,” said  Tom Mikulski , a
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.
“The dollar acted as a catalyst for the fall.”  Cocoa for December delivery dropped $51, or 1.8 percent, to
settle at $2,814 a ton at 12:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest decline since Sept. 7.  Output may exceed demand by 50,000 tons to 100,000 tons in
the season that starts next month, the  International Cocoa
Organization  has forecast.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery fell 14
pounds, or 0.7 percent, to settle at 1,910 pounds ($3,004) a ton
at 4:55 p.m. on NYSE Liffe. The most-active contract declined 24
percent this quarter, the most in at least 21 years.  Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 4.25 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $1.815 a pound in New York. A close at that
price would mark the biggest decline since Sept. 20. Before
today, the most-active contract climbed 12 percent this quarter,
heading for the seventh straight quarterly gain.  In London, robusta coffee for November delivery slipped
$15, or 0.9 percent, at $1,722 a ton.  Global coffee exports rose to 7.9 million bags in August
from 7.63 million bags a year earlier, the International Coffee
Organization said on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
