U.K. stocks  rose, sending the FTSE
100 Index to its longest run of weekly gains since April, as
Chinese manufacturing expanded more than estimated in September.  BHP Billiton Ltd.  and Rio Tinto Group advanced as copper
extended its weekly gain. BG Group Plc climbed 5.1 percent after
its partner Repsol YPF SA said China’s Sinopec will invest $7.1
billion in its Brazilian unit.  HSBC Holdings Plc  climbed 1
percent after Europe’s largest bank was added to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.’s “conviction buy” list.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  climbed 59.9, or 1.1 percent,
to 5,608.52 as of 10:20 a.m. in London, taking this week’s gain
to 0.2 percent. The  FTSE All-Share Index  rose 1 percent and
Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  climbed 0.3 percent.  “Recently we’ve seen some encouraging economic news,”
 Mike Lenhoff , London-based chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin
Securities Ltd., which oversees $33 billion, said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s ‘On The Move’ with Francine
Lacqua. “The markets are going to focus on what this all means
for earnings and we’re going to find out in a few weeks’ time.”  Alcoa Inc., the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, will become
the first Dow company to report third-quarter results on Oct. 7.  The FTSE 100 gained 13 percent last quarter, the index’s
biggest quarterly advance in a year, amid an increase in
takeover activity and as concern eased that the global economic
recovery will falter. Still, lingering concern that some
European countries will fail to repay their debt has left the
gauge 4.4 percent below its April high.  BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto  BHP Billiton , the world’s largest mining company, gained
1.3 percent to 2,052 pence. Rio Tinto, the third biggest, rose
0.9 percent to 3,754 pence. Copper climbed 1.5 percent in
London, headed for a third weekly gain.  China’s purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.8 from 51.7
in August, the country’s logistics federation and statistics
bureau said in an e-mail. None of the 15 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News forecast such a large gain. Readings above 50
mean that manufacturing expanded.  BG Group  rallied 5.1 percent to 1,175 pence. Sinopec will
own 40 percent of Repsol’s Brazilian unit after buying new
shares in the division, the Madrid-based company said today in
an e-mailed statement. Repsol will hold the remaining 60 percent
stake in the Brazilian unit.  Since 2007, Repsol, in a partnership with BG Group and
Brazil’s state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, has found
hydrocarbons in the offshore Carioca, Guara and Iguacu fields in
the Santos Basin’s BM-S-9 block. These are ultra-deep deposits
beneath a salt layer under the seabed.  HSBC  rose 1 percent to 651.3 pence. Europe’s largest bank
was added to Goldman Sachs’s “conviction buy” list.
Separately, HSBC plans to more than double the number of its
U.S. premier banking customers to 1 million by 2013, said  Andy Ireland , head of the American wealth unit.  Spectris Plc  rallied 3.4 percent to 1,109 pence. The U.K.’s
biggest maker of production-testing gear said it has completed
the purchase of N-Tron, a networking products business, for $51
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
