The narrowing gap between the
yields on 2- and 10-year  Treasury  notes has support at 2
percentage points, according to CRT Capital Group LLC.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold the longer
maturity, known as the yield curve, fell 0.24 percentage point
in the third quarter as traders speculated the Federal Reserve
would increase purchases of government debt to support the
economic recovery. The difference touched 1.96 percentage points
on Aug. 26, the lowest since April 2009.  “A flatter curve remains the unchallenged theme, and
momentum has shifted to reflect that trend,”  David Ader  and  Ian Lyngen , U.S. government bond strategists at CRT in Stamford,
Connecticut, wrote in a note to clients today. “Treasury market
positions continue to lean longer.”  The spread widened 0.01 percentage point to 2.08 percentage
points at 3:37 p.m. in New York, from 2.07 percentage points
yesterday.  The difference peaked at 2.91 percentage points on Feb. 22
when the 10-year Treasury yield closed at 3.80 percent. The
yield has since fallen to 2.52 percent, while the 2-year yield
has plunged to 0.42 percent from 0.88 percent.  The yield curve faces resistance at 2.27 percentage points,
according to CRT. That’s the 38.2 percent  Fibonacci retracement 
level from the steepening move that began in April 2009, when
the gap was 1.88 percentage points.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support and resistance refer to
areas on charts where buy and sell orders may be clustered.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
