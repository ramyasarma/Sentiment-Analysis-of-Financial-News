Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  is
recalling 198,000 BMW and Rolls-Royce Phantom vehicles to fix a
potential leak in the power-braking system, the company said
today.  The cars, powered by V8 and V12 engines, include models in
the BMW 5 Series, 6 Series and 7 Series as well as the Phantom,
which has a suggested retail price starting at $380,000. The
recall, described in a letter the company is sending to the
 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , covers cars from
model years ranging from 2002 to 2010.  NHTSA has elevated its investigations after record recalls
of more than 8 million vehicles in the past year by Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s largest automaker, for unintended
acceleration. The regulator announced a power-steering probe of
the BMW Z4 in July, following one crash and 107 complaints.  The power-braking leaks create a vacuum loss that impairs a
feature used when brakes are applied, the company said today in
a  statement  on its website. Manual braking still functions. The
company hasn’t received reports of accidents or injuries.  Munich-based BMW will notify owners of the recalled
vehicles by mail. Dealers will inspect the cars and replace the
parts, the company said. Drivers who lose braking power should
immediately schedule a service appointment, the company said.  In the BMW 7 series, the recall covers the 745i/Li, 750i/Li
and 760i/Li models from 2002 through 2008, as well as the Alpina
B7 from 2007 and 2008. The company’s 645i, 650i, 545i and 550i
models from 2004 through 2010 are also included.  The repair campaign applies to 2003-2010 Rolls-Royce
Phantom models. The Rolls-Royce Ghost isn’t included, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
