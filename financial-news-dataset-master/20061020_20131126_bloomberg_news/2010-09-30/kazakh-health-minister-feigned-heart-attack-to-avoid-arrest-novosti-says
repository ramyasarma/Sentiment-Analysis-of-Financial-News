Kazakh Health Minister  Zhaksylyk Doskaliyev  feigned a heart attack to avoid a criminal probe into
allegations of abuse of office, Novosti-Kazakhstan  reported 
today, citing Murat Zhumanbai, spokesman for the country’s
financial police.  Investigators on Sept. 21 opened a probe into allegations
that as head of a medical school, Doskaliyev illegally signed a
contract with a construction company to build residential
buildings on land owned by the school in exchange for two
apartments and a house, the Kazakh news service reported.  After Doskaliyev was questioned by the financial police, he
had a heart attack and was hospitalized, Novosti-Kazakhstan
said. On Sept. 29, a court refused to approve an arrest warrant
for Doskaliyev, citing his health, the news service said.  After failing in an attempt to flee Kazakhstan, Doskaliyev
conspired with colleagues to simulate a heart attack, the news
service said, citing Zhumanbai.  Almagul Abenova, a Health Ministry spokeswoman, didn’t
answer repeated calls for comment during working hours today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
