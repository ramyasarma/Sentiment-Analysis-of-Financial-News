---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES
New York: U.S. stocks fell, trimming the biggest September rally
since 1939, as investors sold some of the month’s best-
performing shares amid speculation that improving economic data
will reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to stimulate growth.
*The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent to 1,141.20 at 4 p.m. in New
York, trimming its monthly advance to 8.8 percent.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 47.23 points, or 0.4
percent, to 10,788.05.  London: European stocks retreated for a fourth day as U.S.
shares declined, trimming the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s
biggest quarterly advance in a year.
*Allied Irish Banks Plc slid 8.2 percent after the government
announced plans to take majority control of the lender.
*Compass Group Plc declined 3.8 percent as the world’s largest
catering company’s forecasts missed some analysts’ estimates.
*The Stoxx 600 slid 0.5 percent to 259.72 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London.
*National benchmark indexes rose in 11 out of the 18 western
European markets.  Tokyo: Japanese stocks fell, led by electronics makers and banks,
amid concern that Europe’s debt crisis will slow a recovery of
the global economy?and after Nintendo Co. tumbled, dragging down
parts suppliers.

dividend forecasts.

percent to 4,582.90 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in
Sydney.     New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 1.5 percent to
3,178.09 at the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar gained against the majority of its most-
traded counterparts after stronger-than-forecast U.S. economic
reports damped speculation the Federal Reserve will take
additional steps to lower interest rates.
*The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major
counterparts, rose for the first time in five days.

since April 12.

speculation that the Federal Reserve will step up quantitative
easing.

point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.51 percent at 4:26 p.m. in

*Stockpiles  tracked by the London Metal Exchange fell for
the fourth straight day to the lowest level since Nov. 4.  OIL  New York: Crude oil  rose, capping the biggest monthly gain

and weekly jobless claims beat economists’ estimates in signs
that demand may improve.
