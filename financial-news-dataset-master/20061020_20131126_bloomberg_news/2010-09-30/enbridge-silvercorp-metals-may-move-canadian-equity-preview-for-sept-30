Canadian stocks  fell from a two-
year high as gold futures dropped after the U.S. reported fewer
initial jobless claims than most economists forecast and raised
its estimate of second-quarter economic growth.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer of the
metal, declined 2.1 percent as an  index  of S&P/TSX gold stocks
retreated from a 2 1/2-year high. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan
Inc., the world’s biggest fertilizer producer, lost 1.8 percent
after corn prices fell to a two-week low. Canadian Oil Sands
Trust, the largest owner of the Syncrude project, gained 3.2
percent as crude futures advanced to a seven-week high.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  slipped 14.17
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,368.65.  “People buy gold when they think the apocalypse is
coming,” said  David Baskin , president of Baskin Financial
Services Inc. in Toronto, which manages C$350 million ($341
million). “If things are getting better, the rationale for gold
to be at record highs becomes weaker.”  The S&P/TSX rallied 9.5 percent this quarter, which would
be the biggest quarterly gain since the three months ending
September 2009. The market has been  led  by fertilizer stocks,
which soared 58 percent thanks to BHP Billiton Ltd.’s $40
billion unsolicited bid for Potash Corp., and base-metals and
coal companies, which jumped 43 percent as a group on higher
copper prices.  Jobless Claims  The U.S. Labor Department reported today that 453,000
people filed first-time unemployment claims last week.
Economists had forecast a figure of 460,000, according to the
median of 47 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey . The Labor
Department also reduced its tally for the previous week to
465,000 from an initially reported 469,000.  U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 1.7 percent
annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said
today in Washington. The department had estimated a second-
quarter growth rate of 1.6 percent last month, and most of the
81 economists in a Bloomberg survey did not forecast an upward
revision to the number.  Thirty  of 33 S&P/TSX Gold Index companies dropped as the
metal slipped 0.1 percent after six days of gains that took it
to a record close. Goldcorp Inc., the world’s second-largest
gold producer by market value, declined 1.9 percent to C$44.70.
Eldorado Gold Corp., Canada’s fifth-biggest producer by market
value, lost 3.4 percent to C$19.02.  Peru Production  Barrick slumped 2.1 percent to C$47.55. The Peruvian
government said gold production plunged 25 percent in August due
to falling output at mines operated by Barrick and Newmont
Mining Corp.  Gold and copper producer Northgate Minerals Corp. sank 5.5
percent, the  most in the S&P/TSX , to C$3.11. The company
increased an offering of debt that can be converted into stock
to $150 million from $135 million.  Oil futures gained 2.7 percent in New York to $79.97 a
barrel after the release of the U.S. economic data. Canadian Oil
Sands Trust increased 3.2 percent to C$25.46. Petrobank Energy
and Resources Ltd., which produces oil and gas in Canada and
Colombia, climbed 3.3 percent to C$41.84.  EnCana Corp., Canada’s largest natural gas producer, surged
4 percent to C$31.09. Investors may be speculating EnCana is
nearing a joint venture with China Natural Petroleum Corp.,
 Randy Ollenberger , an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said in an
interview. The two companies signed a memorandum of
understanding in June that may lead to a joint project to
exploit shale-gas deposits in British Columbia.  Rating Raised  Peyto Energy Trust, which surged 6.3 percent yesterday
after announcing plans to convert to a corporation, rallied
another 1.8 percent today to C$15.54.  Jill Angevine , an analyst
at FirstEnergy Capital Corp., raised her rating on the stock to
“outperform” from “market perform.”  Enerplus Resources Fund, which announced its conversion
plans today, rose 2.8 percent to C$26.50. The company has gained
seven days in a row, the longest streak since February 2008.  Fertilizer producers dropped after the U.S. Agriculture
Department said corn inventories rose to the highest level since
2006. Also, the Financial Times reported Sinochem Group has been
unable to form a group with OAO Uralkali to make a bid for
Potash Corp.  Potash Corp. declined 1.8 percent to C$147.49. Agrium Inc.,
Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer, lost 3 percent to
C$77.20.  Open Text Corp., Canada’s largest software company, fell
2.6 percent to C$48.55 after  Mark Schappel , an analyst at
Benchmark Co., cut his rating on the shares to “hold” from
“buy.” The stock had jumped 20 percent since Schappel set the
“buy” rating on Open Text in February, the analyst said in a
note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
