Dubai Financial Group LLC cut its
stake in Malaysian lender Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd. to 30.5
percent from 40 percent after a capital raising exercise,
according to an exchange filing in Kuala Lumpur today.  Dubai Financial didn’t take up an offer to buy the bank’s
Islamic preference shares. Lembaga Tabung Haji, a Malaysian
pilgrims’ fund which did participate, saw its stake raised to
18.5 percent from 9 percent. BIMB Holdings Bhd. maintained its
shareholding at 51 percent, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
