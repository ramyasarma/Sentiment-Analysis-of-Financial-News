Nintendo Co.  tumbled the most in 20
months in Osaka trading after the company cut its profit
forecast and pushed back the release of its 3DS handheld game
player until after the year-end holiday season.  Nintendo  plunged 8.9 percent to 20,970 yen at 10:38 a.m. on
the Osaka Securities Exchange, poised for the largest drop since
January 2009. The decline wiped out all of Nintendo’s gains for
2010 and the stock was the worst performer on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index.  President  Satoru Iwata  said yesterday the company pushed
back the release of the 3DS, the biggest overhaul of Nintendo’s
flagship handheld device since 2004, until Feb. 26 because of
concerns over production. The Japanese games maker also blamed a
stronger-than-anticipated yen for slashing its annual  net income 
forecast 55 percent.  “Smacks of a company that has lost its way: Bad
forecasting, slow delivery,” MF Global FXA Securities Ltd.
wrote in an equity-sales note to clients today. “It’s pretty
much the worst case scenario for Nintendo.”  Profit will fall to a six-year low of 90 billion yen ($1.1
billion) in the 12 months ending March 31, while  sales  will
probably drop 23 percent to 1.1 trillion yen, Nintendo said.
Operating profit, or revenue minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, will slump 41 percent to 210 billion
yen, missing the previous outlook by 34 percent.  Stronger Yen  The company changed its assumptions for the yen’s exchange
rate to 85 yen to the dollar from 95 yen, and 110 yen to the
euro from 120 yen.  The 3DS  will be priced at 25,000 yen when it begins selling
in Japan on Feb. 26 and is Nintendo’s biggest portable product
debut since the 2004 release of the touch-screen DS player,
which sold more than 132 million units worldwide. The product
will go on sale in the U.S. and Europe in March, Nintendo said.  Nintendo yesterday also slashed its annual DS sales outlook
22 percent to 23.5 million units in the year to March 2011 and
cut the sales forecast for the Wii 2.8 percent to 17.5 million
units.  The company said it will probably sell 125 million units of
DS software, of which 15 million will be titles for the 3-D
version. It previously estimated software sales of 150 million
units. Sales of Wii titles will drop 30 percent to 135 million
units, 18 percent less than its previous goal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
