Uganda’s inflation rate fell to 0.3
percent in September, its lowest level in at least six years,
after food costs eased, the country’s statistics agency said.  Inflation in east Africa’s third-biggest economy slowed
from 1.7 percent in August, the  Uganda Bureau of Statistics  said
in a statement handed to reporters today in the capital,
Kampala. Prices rose 1 percent during the month, it said.  The inflation rate has declined from a high of 14.5 percent
in September last year, when food prices jumped almost 50
percent after a drought reduced supplies. Food makes up 27
percent of the inflation basket. The food-price index dropped an
annual 9.5 percent in September, the bureau said.  Underlying inflation, which excludes food, fuel,
electricity and metered-water costs, accelerated to 4.1 percent
from 4 percent in August, the statistics office said.  Uganda’s central bank plans to introduce policies that will
enable it to target a specific inflation rate over the next five
years, starting with repurchasing government debt in the
secondary market to control money supply, the Bank of Uganda
said on Aug. 25.  Uganda, with a population of 31 million people and a $16
billion economy, according to the World Bank, is Africa’s
second-largest biggest coffee exporter after Ethiopia, according
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
