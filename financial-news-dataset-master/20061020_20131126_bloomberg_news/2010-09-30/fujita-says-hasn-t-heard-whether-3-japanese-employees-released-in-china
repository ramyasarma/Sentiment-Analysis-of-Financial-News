Japanese construction company
Fujita Corp. said it hasn’t heard whether three of its employees
were released from detention in China.  China’s Xinhua News Agency said earlier today that three
Japanese held for entering a military zone have been released.
Four Fujita employees were detained last week for allegedly
videotaping military targets.  “No one has contacted us,” Fujita spokesman Yoshiaki
Onodera said. “We will confirm the validity of the report.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
