The European Union threatened to
impose tariffs on steel pipes from China to curb import
competition for EU producers.  The EU opened an inquiry into whether Chinese makers of
stainless steel seamless pipes and tubes sell them in the 27-
nation bloc below cost, a practice known as dumping.  The investigation will determine whether imports from China
are “being dumped and whether this dumping has caused injury to
the union industry,” the European Commission, the EU’s trade
authority in Brussels, said today in the  Official Journal . The
commission has nine months to decide whether to impose
provisional anti-dumping duties for half a year and EU
governments have 15 months to decide whether to apply
“definitive” levies for five years.  The probe stems from an Aug. 16 dumping complaint by an
industry group on behalf of producers that account for more than
50 percent of the EU’s output of the pipes and tubes covered by
the investigation, said the commission, which didn’t identify
any companies.  In 2009, the EU imposed five-year anti-dumping tariffs on
types of seamless pipes and tubes from China used in the
construction, energy and engineering industries, citing the
“threat of injury” to EU producers including ArcelorMittal as
a result of cheaper imports.  Those levies, which are as high as 39.2 percent and cover
pipes and tubes of circular cross-section and an external
diameter not exceeding 406.4 millimeters (16 inches), are also
made in Europe by such companies as Vallourec SA and Tubos
Reunidos SA. The case highlighted the EU’s readiness to protect
European manufacturers from lower-cost competitors because
European anti-dumping duties usually aim to counter actual harm
to EU industries rather than the possibility of it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
