Three-time Tour de France winner
Alberto Contador said he tested positive for a banned substance
at this year’s race, the New York Times reported, citing a
statement by his spokesman, Jacinto Vidarte.  Contador learned on Aug. 24 that he tested positive for
clenbuterol, a stimulant that increases aerobic capacity and the
flow of oxygen in the bloodstream, on July 21, the Times
reported. Contador beat Andy Schleck by 39 seconds to win this
year’s edition of the Tour.  The Spaniard said in a statement that the failed drug test
was a “food contamination case,” the Times added. He’s
scheduled to hold a press conference today in his hometown of
Pinto, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
