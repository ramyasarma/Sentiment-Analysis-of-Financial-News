Iran exported its first
domestically produced gasoline to neighboring Iraq, Ali Asghar
Arshi, the National Iranian Oil Co.’s director of international
affairs, told the state-run  Mehr  news agency.  Iran says it has countered sanctions that target its
historic need to import gasoline and can now produce more than
enough of the fuel.  Iran’s Oil Ministry said two days ago that it has exported
its first load of gasoline, adding yesterday that four more
shipments would soon be made.  The Persian Gulf country, the second-largest oil producer
in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia, previously relied on
imports for as much as 40 percent of its gasoline as it lacked
the refining capacity to meet consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
