A slowing merchant shipping fleet is
concealing capacity that will undermine the industry’s recovery
as world trade quickens, according to Arctic Securities ASA, an
Oslo-based investment bank.  The attached chart shows an across-the-board slowdown in
merchant ships’ sailing speeds, spanning crude and oil products
tankers, dry-bulk carriers and container ships. The slower they
go, the fewer there are for hire. Conversely, those vessels can
go faster when trade picks up.  “If we were to see the market return to the tightness we
saw before the financial crisis, owners would speed up their
ships and add a considerable amount of capacity,”  Martin Sommerseth Jaer , an analyst at Arctic, said by phone. “There’s
latent, hidden capacity.”  The biggest reduction occurred in container shipping, where
speeds dropped by 20 percent from their peak, according to
Arctic estimates. The second-largest slowdown has been for
supertankers that can carry 2 million barrels of oil, he said.  “Everybody is slow-steaming across the board, but the most
hidden capacity is within the container sector,” Jaer said.
“That’s where the upside will be most capped.”  Speeds and fleet sizes move approximately in tandem,
meaning that a 10 percent change in how fast the vessels are
moving equates to a similar alteration in supply, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
