The U.S. may lose about a third of
its banks as the weakening economy weeds out the least healthy
institutions, said  John Kanas , chief executive officer of
BankUnited.  “Most of us in the business think we probably need 5,000
and think we are on our way to 5,000 as this cycle, if this is a
cycle, unfolds,” Kanas, 63, said today at the Bloomberg
Dealmakers Summit in New York. “We simply chartered too many
banks.”  The  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  said it insured
deposits at 7,830 financial institutions as of June 30. Kanas
became CEO of Miami Lakes, Florida-based BankUnited last year by
joining a group of private equity investors who agreed to inject
about $900 million into the collapsed Florida lender. The other
investors include Carlyle Group, Centerbridge Capital Partners,
WL Ross & Co., and Blackstone Group LP.  “It’s not as easy as it once was when the market was going
straight up and real estate values were on a straight incline,”
Kanas said. “It will require people with greater experience
levels and with tougher attitude toward the industry to carve
out a future in this business.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
