U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
named  Google Inc . Chief Executive Officer  Eric Schmidt  and
 Martin Sorrell , CEO of Dublin-based  WPP Plc , to a 19-strong
panel to advise the government on economic and business policy.  The Business Advisory Group will meet four times a year,
with sessions attended by Cameron, Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  and Business Secretary  Vince Cable , the prime
minister’s office in London said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Having an advisory group with a range of experience and
expertise should ensure that there is real interaction and
discussion,” Cameron said in the statement. “It is vital that
we get these policies right as we take forward our plans to
drive down the deficit and transform our economy.”  Other members of the group, none of whom will receive any
payment for their role, include  BAE Systems Plc  Chairman  Dick Olver ,  Burberry Group Plc  CEO  Angela Ahrendts , Tata Group
Chairman  Ratan Tata  and  Andrew Witty , CEO of GlaxoSmithKline
Plc. HSBC Holdings Plc Chairman  Stephen Green , who will become a
trade minister in January, will also sit on the panel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
