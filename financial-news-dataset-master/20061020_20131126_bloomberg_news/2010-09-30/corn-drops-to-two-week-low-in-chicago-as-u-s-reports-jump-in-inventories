Corn fell to the lowest price in
more than two weeks after the U.S., the biggest grower and
exporter, said inventories before the harvest rose to the
highest level since 2006.  Stockpiles  on Sept. 1 totaled 1.708 billion bushels, up 2
percent from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said today in a report. Analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
expected 1.407 billion, on average. Supplies increased even as
corn usage rose in the three months ended Aug. 31 from a year
earlier. Farmers are expected to collect a record harvest.  The inventory number “is a negative surprise, and the
market is adjusting to more of a supply cushion,” said  Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst for Agrivisor LLC in
Bloomington, Illinois. “It’s like adding 2 million acres to
this year’s harvest.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 9.25 cents, or 1.8
percent, to close at $4.9575 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, after touching $4.7825, the lowest level
since Sept. 13.  Corn has surged 33 percent since the end of June, reaching
a two-year high at $5.2875 on Sept. 27, on concern that hot, dry
weather in August and flooding in June damaged U.S. crops. The
three-month gain was the biggest for a third quarter since 1974.  The USDA earlier this month predicted a record crop of
13.16 billion bushels (334.3 million metric tons), up 0.4
percent from last year. The government will update its forecast
on Oct. 8.  An estimated 27 percent of the crop was collected as of
Sept. 26, up from 18 percent a week earlier and the previous
five-year average of 15 percent, the USDA said this week. Mostly
dry weather will aid harvesting the next two weeks, World
Weather Inc. said today in a report.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
