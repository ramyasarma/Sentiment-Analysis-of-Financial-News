OAO Svyazinvest recommended Vadim
Semyonov, a classmate of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, as
chief executive officer of the national telephone holding.  The board of Svyazinvest decided yesterday to ask
shareholders of the state-run company to approve the candidacy
of Semyonov, currently deputy CEO of long-distance operator OAO
Rostelecom, Svyazinvest said in a statement on its website.  Semyonov holds Canadian and Russian citizenship, which may
prevent him from being approved to run Svyazinvest because top
executives in so-called strategic companies have access to state
secrets, the Vedomosti newspaper reported Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
