PPL Corp.  won conditional approval
from Kentucky regulators for its $6.7 billion purchase of  E.ON
AG ’s U.S. utilities, clearing its “biggest regulatory hurdle.”  PPL has the “managerial, technical and financial ability”
to operate Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities,
E.ON’s two units in the state, the Public Service Commission
said in a statement on its website today. The utilities serve
about 1.2 million customers, according to PPL.  “Most of the customers of these utilities are in Kentucky,
so that’s the biggest regulatory hurdle we had,”  Daniel McCarthy , a spokesman for Allentown, Pennsylvania-based PPL,
said in a telephone interview.  The commission accepted a settlement that PPL reached with
the state attorney general, unions, large energy users and
others earlier this month. The settlement includes a ban on
base-rate increases until 2013 and the sharing of any savings
from the deal between PPL stockholders and utility customers.  PPL agreed to buy the E.ON units in April for $6.7 billion
in cash and the assumption of $925 million in debt. It still
needs approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and
regulators in Virginia and Tennessee.  The company asked the federal regulator to approve the
purchase by Oct. 15, after reaching an agreement with two groups
that had protested it, according to a  statement  on PPL’s
website.  PPL  fell  18 cents to $27.23 at 4:15 p.m. in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen
16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
