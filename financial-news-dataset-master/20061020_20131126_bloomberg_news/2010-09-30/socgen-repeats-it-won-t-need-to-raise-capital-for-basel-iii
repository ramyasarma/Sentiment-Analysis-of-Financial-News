Societe Generale SA , France’s
second-biggest bank, repeated that it won’t need to raise new
capital to meet Basel III requirements.  “As we previously indicated, Societe Generale will not
need to raise capital,” the Paris-based lender said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The  company  “will comply with the Basel III common equity
requirement of 7 percent as of 2013,” Chief Executive Officer
 Frederic Oudea  said in a presentation published on the bank’s
website yesterday. The lender’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, a
measure of financial strength, will be above 8 percent by 2012
under Basel II rules, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
