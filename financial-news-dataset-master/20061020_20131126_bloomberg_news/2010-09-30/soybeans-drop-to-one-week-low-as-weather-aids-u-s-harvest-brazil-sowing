Soybeans fell to a one-week low as
dry weather allows U.S. farmers to accelerate the pace of the
harvest while rain in Brazil and Argentina improves conditions
for planting and early crop development.  Little rain is forecast over the next two weeks in U.S.
growing areas,  World Weather Inc.  said today in a report. Rains
this week in South America will improve soil moisture,
especially for dry fields in central Brazil, the private
forecaster said. The U.S. is the biggest producer and exporter,
followed by Brazil and Argentina.  “Soybeans are falling because of favorable harvest weather
in the U.S. and improved planting conditions in South America,”
said  Anne Frick , a senior commodity analyst for Prudential Bache
Commodities LLC in New York. “Anecdotal yield reports point to
a record U.S. crop this year.”  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 7.75 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $10.9125 a bushel at 10:56 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after touching $10.8225, the lowest price since
Sept. 23. The most-active futures are heading for the first
three-day drop since the slump ended Sept. 10.  On Sept. 27, the price reached $11.44, an eight-month high,
on speculation that rains may damage U.S. crops and dry weather
would delay planting in South America.  U.S. production will total 3.483 billion bushels, up 3.7
percent from a record 3.359 billion last year, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said Sept. 10. The government is
scheduled to update its forecast on Oct. 8.  The U.S. soybean crop was valued at $31.8 billion last
year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
