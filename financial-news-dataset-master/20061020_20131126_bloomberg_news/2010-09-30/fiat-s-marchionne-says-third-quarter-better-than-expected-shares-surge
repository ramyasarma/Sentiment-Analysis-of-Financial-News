Fiat SpA climbed to a two-year high
in Milan trading after Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne 
said the Italian carmaker will raise its financial targets and
will report a profit for 2010.  Fiat, which acquired a 20 percent stake in Chrysler Group
LLC last year, will post full-year net income, Marchionne said
today at the Paris Motor Show. The company had forecast 
“near break-even” earnings in April.  Third-quarter results were better than expected, said
Marchionne, adding that he looked at Fiat’s most recent
financial figures last night. Marchionne reiterated that he’s
open to a possible partnership for the truck and tractor
business that he is separating from Fiat and that he has no
intention to sell the Alfa Romeo brand.  Fiat  jumped  as much as 39 cents, or 3.6 percent, to 11.36
euros, the highest price since Sept. 4, 2008. The stock is up
3.5 percent at 2:52 p.m. in Milan, valuing the carmaker at 13.6
billion euros ($18.6 billion).  Fiat is spinning off industrial operations including the
Iveco truckmaker and the CNH Global NV tractor division to focus
on carmaking. The Turin-based company plans to list Fiat
Industrial shares on the Milan exchange on Jan. 3.  Marchionne said September “was not a great month in Italy
and Europe.” European auto sales fell for a fifth consecutive
month in August, led by Fiat,  Ford Motor Co.  and Toyota Motor
Corp. Fiat recorded the biggest decline among the major
manufacturers, with sales falling 24 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
