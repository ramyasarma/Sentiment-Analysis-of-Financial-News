Democrat  Andrew Cuomo  received the
support of 53 percent of likely New York voters, to Republican
 Carl Paladino ’s 38 percent in the race for governor, according
to a Marist College poll.  Cuomo, the state’s attorney general, led Paladino by a
wider margin, 19 points, in a Marist poll released Sept. 24.
 Rick Lazio , the Conservative Party candidate, had the backing of
9 percent in last week’s Marist poll. He dropped out of the race
on Sept. 27.  “Cuomo continues to hold a double-digit lead, but the
numbers have shifted somewhat following Lazio’s withdrawal from
the race,”  Lee M. Miringoff , director of The Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, New York, said in
a statement. “Without Lazio on the Conservative Party line,
Paladino is more competitive in the New York City suburbs and
among non-enrolled voters.”  New Yorkers will choose on Nov. 2 between Cuomo, 52, the
son of former Governor  Mario Cuomo , and Paladino, 64, a Buffalo
real-estate developer and Tea Party supporter.  Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in New York,
5.79 million to 2.91 million, according to the Board of
Elections.  In the New York City suburbs, Cuomo leads by 49 percent to
43 percent, with 7 percent of likely voters undecided. In last
week’s poll, Cuomo garnered support from 52 percent in this
group, with Paladino receiving 30 percent and Lazio taking 16
percent. Three percent hadn’t made up their minds.  Paladino won an upset Sept. 14 in the Republican primary,
beating Lazio, the candidate selected by party leaders. With an
“I’m Mad as Hell” slogan, he has promised to clean up Albany
with “a baseball bat” and to cut taxes 10 percent and spending
20 percent in his first year as governor.  Marist College polled 943 registered voters by telephone
from Sept. 27-29, of which 591 are likely voters. The  poll’s 
margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points for likely
voters.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
