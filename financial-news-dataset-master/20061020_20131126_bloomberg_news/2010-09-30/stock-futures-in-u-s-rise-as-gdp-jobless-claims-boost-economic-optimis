U.S. stock-index futures rose,
erasing earlier losses, after government data showed the 
economy and personal consumption grew more than estimated in 
the second quarter and jobless claims decreased more than 
forecast last week.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December climbed 0.2 percent to 1,143.1 at 8:31 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures advanced 19 points,
or 0.2 percent, to 10,798.  The U.S. economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, faster than the 1.6 percent previously
estimated. Initial jobless claims decreased by 16,000 to 453,000
in the week ended Sept. 25, lower than the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent to 1,144.73 yesterday,
trimming its best September rally since 1939. The gauge, which
is up 2.7 percent so far this year, has fallen 6 percent from
its peak for 2010 on April 23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
lost 0.2 percent to 10,835.28 yesterday.  The VIX Index, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index is known, climbed 2.9 percent to 23.25
yesterday, rising for a third day. The VStoxx Index, which
measures the cost of protecting against declines in the Euro
Stoxx 50 Index, rose 4.3 percent to 26.13 today.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will address a
Senate Banking Committee hearing today amid speculation that the
central bank will buy more debt to support the recovery.  Fed officials have publicly disagreed about the benefits of
new monetary stimulus in a sign that Bernanke has yet to secure
a consensus on whether to buy more Treasuries.  Policy makers have the tools to act and should respond
“vigorously, creatively, thoughtfully and persistently” to a
slow recovery, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said
yesterday in a New York speech. Separately, Philadelphia Fed
President Charles Plosser said in New Jersey that the central
bank risks its credibility by taking actions, such as additional
securities purchases, that may fail to help the labor market.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
