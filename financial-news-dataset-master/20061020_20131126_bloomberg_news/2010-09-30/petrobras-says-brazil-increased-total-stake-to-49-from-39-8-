Petroleo Brasileiro SA  said
Brazil’s government increased its voting stake in the state-
controlled oil company to 64.3 percent from 57.5 percent after
completing the world’s largest share sale last week.  The government increased its total holdings to 49 percent
from 39.8 percent, including stock held through the state
development bank and the sovereign wealth fund, the company said
today in a regulatory filing. The government raised its direct
and indirect holding of preferred shares to 28.6 percent from
15.5 percent.  Petrobras, based in Rio de Janeiro, sold 4.08 billion
shares in the global sale, excluding a potential additional
offering by the banks coordinating the sale, according to the
filing. The company raised 115.1 billion reais ($67.9 billion),
including 67.8 billion reais in government bonds known as LFTs,
according to the final allocation, which excludes the
supplementary offering.  BNDES, as Brazil’s development bank is known, increased its
holding of voting and preferred shares to 13.5 percent from 7.7
percent, Petrobras said. The Brazilian sovereign fund holds 3.9
percent of the shares and minority shareholders control the
remaining 51 percent of the stock.  ‘State Intervention’  Brazil holds presidential elections on Oct. 3. Dilma
Rousseff, the chosen successor of President Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva, leads the opinion polls over opposition candidate Jose
Serra.  “Strong” demand for shares was “heavily driven” by the
government and state-owned entities, Juliette Kerr, a London-
based analyst at IHS Global Insight, said today in an e-mail.  “Part of this is down to electoral factors and certainly
the risk of increasing state interference is not as great as in
some neighboring countries,” Kerr said. “There does appear to
be a trend toward increased state intervention.”  Petrobras  fell  0.6 percent to 27.44 reais in Sao Paulo at
1:23 p.m. New York time. The stock has dropped 25 percent this
year, while the benchmark Bovespa stock index added 0.8 percent.  Petrobras sold 115 billion reais of shares, plus an option
for more, on Sept. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
