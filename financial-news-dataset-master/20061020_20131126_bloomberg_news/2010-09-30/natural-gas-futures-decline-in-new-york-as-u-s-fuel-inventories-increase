Natural gas futures fell, capping
a second quarterly decline in the past three quarters, after a
government report showed that U.S. inventories increased more
than forecast last week.  Gas stockpiles rose 74 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Sept. 24 to 3.414 trillion, the Energy Department said today.
Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg indicated a gain of 68
billion. A separate survey of Bloomberg users predicted an
increase of 66 billion.  “We are swimming in gas right now, and with the lack of
usage for cooling and heating there is just not a whole lot of
demand,” said  Carl Neill , an energy consultant at Risk
Management Inc. in Atlanta. “The question now is how full we
get the storage ahead of the winter.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 9 cents, or 2.3
percent, to settle at $3.872 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas traded at $3.883 before
the report was released at 10:30 a.m. in Washington. The futures
declined 16 percent this quarter.  Rising gas stockpiles and forecasts for a mild winter are
crushing the premium on March futures compared with the April
contract. The spread between the two contracts narrowed 93
percent this year to 3.9 cents per million British thermal units
today.  Last week’s storage increase was bigger than the five-year
average gain for the week of 67 billion cubic feet. A surplus to
the five-year average rose to 6.3 percent from 6.2 percent the
previous week. A deficit to year-earlier supplies narrowed to
4.6 percent from 5 percent.  Supply Outlook  Inventories will peak at 3.687 trillion cubic feet before
cold-weather demand prompts utilities to pull gas from storage,
the department predicted in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook  on Sept. 8. Stockpiles rose to a record 3.837 trillion
cubic feet last November.  “The bearish injection surprised the market,” said  Scott Hanold , an energy analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Minneapolis.
“So in the short term the market continues to focus on what
remains an out-of-balance situation.”  U.S. natural gas production fell 1.2 percent in July as
output in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska declined, the Energy
Department reported yesterday.  Gas output dropped to 71.02 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 71.88 billion in June, the lowest level since September,
2009, the department’s Energy Information Administration said in
a monthly report known as  EIA-914 .  Offshore Output  Production in federal offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico
dropped 2 percent to 5.87 billion cubic feet a day because of
maintenance and tropical storms, the government said in the
report.  Output in the lower 48 states rose 0.3 percent to 64.38
billion cubic feet a day.  The EIA-914 report covers gas gross withdrawals, which
include gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared,
and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  A weather system about 600 miles east of the Windward
Islands has a 30 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone
in the next 48 hours, according to the  National Hurricane
Center . The system is moving west-northwest at around 15 to 20
miles per hour (24-32 kilometers per hour), the center said.  As little as 7.9 billion cubic feet of gas production was
shut in from June through August because of storms, lower than
projections of 57.4 billion, the Energy Department said in the
outlook on Sept. 8.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, gained 3.66 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.8451 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
207,879 as of 2:41 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
257,000. Volume was 140,020 yesterday. Open interest was 773,307
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 805,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
