Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki
Katainen said the the euro area “is not in trouble.”  Speaking in an interview in Brussels today, Katainen said
he favors quasi-automatic penalities for deficit offenders.
“I’m in favor of as automatic as possible,” he said.  Katainen declined to comment on Ireland’s bank
bailout or the downgrade of Spain’s credit rating by Moody’s
