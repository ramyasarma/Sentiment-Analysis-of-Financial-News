Ferrari SpA , the maker of the
$228,000 California supercar, will increase profit by more than
10 percent this year, helped by a surge in demand in emerging
markets, said Chairman  Luca Cordero  di Montezemolo.  “We will close the year better than last year,” with
double-digit growth rate in earnings, Montezemolo said in an
interview at the Paris Motor Show today. Fiat SpA’s most
profitable brand may end 2010 with record earnings, he said.  The luxury-car maker plans to start selling in India
starting next year, the executive said. Ferrari’s earnings
before interest, taxes and one-time gains or losses, or trading
profit, rose by 10 percent to 77 million euros ($105 million) in
the second quarter as revenue increased 8.7 percent. China sales
jumped 20 percent in the first half.  Fiat Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  unveiled a
five-year plan for Ferrari and Maserati on April 21, along with
new targets for all the group brands, calling for the two luxury
carmakers to almost double revenue to about 4 billion euros by
2014 by adding products and widening model ranges.  Ferrari isn’t planning an initial public offering,
Montezemolo said today. Corriere della Sera reported Sept. 26
that Fiat may sell shares of Ferrari in an IPO to help fund the
purchase of more stock in Chrysler Group LLC.  Turin, Italy-based Fiat acquired a 20 percent holding in
Chrysler in June last year. It plans to increase the stake to 25
percent as soon as December.  Ferrari’s trading profit for 2009 fell 30 percent to 238
million euros. Fiat has a target of 210 million euros of trading
profit for Maserati and Ferrari this year, according to a July
21 presentation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
