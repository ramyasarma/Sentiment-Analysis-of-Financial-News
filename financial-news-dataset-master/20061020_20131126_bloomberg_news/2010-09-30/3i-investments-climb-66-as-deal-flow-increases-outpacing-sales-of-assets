3i Group Plc , Europe’s largest
publicly traded private equity firm, said the pace of
investments rose 66 percent in the five months to the end of
August, outpacing the sale of assets.  The firm spent 257 million pounds ($407 million), compared
with 155 million pounds in the year-earlier period, London-based
3i said in a statement today. It made 129 million pounds from
selling investments, down from 448 million pounds.  3i, one of the U.K.’s oldest private equity firms, is
seeking to boost profit after the credit crisis slowed deal-
making. The firm agreed to buy Mizuho Investment Management U.K.
Ltd. for 18.3 million pounds on Sept. 27 to expand its
investments in corporate debt.  “The formal launch of our debt-management business,
following the acquisition of Mizuho Investment Management, gives
us three platforms for growth, private equity, infrastructure
and debt management,” Chief Executive Officer  Michael Queen 
said in the statement.  3i  rose  0.4 percent to 286.5 pence at the close of trading
in London, giving the company a market value of 2.8 billion
pounds. The shares have gained 1.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
