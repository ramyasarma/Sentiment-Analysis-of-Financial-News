Poland plans to sell the smallest
amount of domestic bonds this year in the fourth quarter after
record demand from international investors helped cover most of
its borrowing needs.  The country may offer from 8.9 billion zloty ($3.05
billion) to 15.9 billion zloty of bonds maturing in 2013, 2016,
2020 as well as road bonds, the Finance Ministry said in an e-
mailed statement. The amount will be lower than the 26.4 billion
zloty of bonds the country sold between July and September, the
least so far this year.  Polish bonds have lured investors as growth has accelerated
and  inflation  slowed to a three-year low in the only European
Union economy to avoid recession in 2009. The government covered
88 percent of the year’s 193.5 billion-zloty borrowing plan
through the end of September, according to  Piotr Marczak , the
head of the Finance Ministry’s public debt department.  The ministry has “radically reduced” the bond supply as
borrowing needs have already been met to a “large extent,”
Marczak wrote in an e-mailed response to questions from
Bloomberg News today. “If the market situation permits we will
finance some of next year’s needs at exchange sales.”  The ministry is planning three such exchange auctions for
the rest of 2010, where it swaps bonds about to mature for
longer-dated debt, next quarter, the Finance Ministry said in
its statement.  ‘Dovish Rhetoric’  The yield on Polish 5-year bonds fell 2 basis points to
5.06 percent as of 2:01 p.m. in Warsaw, the lowest level since
Aug. 20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has fallen
85 basis points so far this year compared with an 83-basis point
fall for the equivalent Hungarian debt.  Foreign holdings of domestic bonds rose by a record 11.5
billion zloty in August and by 42.9 billion zloty since the
start of the year. International investors now own 124.6 billion
zloty of the zloty-denominated government securities, he said.  The Polish central bank’s “dovish rhetoric” may boost
foreign demand for bonds and strengthen the zloty, BNP Paribas
SA wrote in a note to clients today. Policy makers yesterday
left the main interest rate at a record low of 3.5 percent for a
15th month and said they saw limited inflation.  The European Union’s eastern members are scaling down bond
sales in the final three months of the year as they seek to
reduce budget deficits. Hungary last month lowered its 2010 plan
for net debt sales and opted to borrow more for longer
maturities. The Czech Republic has reduced debt issuance after
raising 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) from the sale of
Eurobonds this month that attracted bids at lower yields that
the higher rated Italy.  10.5 Billion Zloty  Poland’s quarterly plan includes total sales of as much as
10.5 billion zloty of new benchmark 2-year and 5-year bonds at
auctions in October and December. The ministry will also offer
from 1.5 billion to 3.5 billion zloty of 10-year bonds on Nov.
17. It may also seek to raise as much 1.86 billion zloty of road
bonds maturing in 2018 through a state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa
Krajowego on Dec. 8.  The ministry may also sell bonds in yen in the fourth
quarter and borrow 700 million euros from the European
Investment Bank, it said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
