Valero Energy Corp.  and other U.S.
Gulf Coast refiners may get a boost to their margins and stock
prices because of an increase in facility shutdowns next month,
an analyst with RBC Capital Markets said.  About 1.2 million barrels a day of U.S.  refining capacity 
are expected to be shutdown in October, a 400,000-barrel-a-day
increase from the same time in 2009, according to a research
note issued today by  Jacques Rousseau  of RBC. Most of the
outages are expected in the Gulf Coast, reducing inventories and
increasing margins, he wrote.  “We expect declining refined product inventories and
positive momentum in refining margins and refining  stock prices 
to continue through mid-October,” wrote Rousseau, who is based
in Reston, Virginia, and doesn’t own shares in refining
companies.  Gasoline producers’  margins , or the difference between what
a company pays for crude and how much they get for the refined
fuel, were $5.468 today, down 71 percent from a 15-month high of
$18.77 on May 13. The margins, or crack spreads, are based on
futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Valero, based in San Antonio,  rose  24 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $17.51 at 4:15 p.m. in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 4.5 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
