Tea production in  Kenya , the
world’s biggest grower of black tea, may increase by 11 percent
this year as the industry recovers from a drought, the Kenya Tea
Board said.  Output may climb to 350 million kilograms (770 million
pounds), the Kenya Tea Board said in a statement handed to
reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. Last year, the East
African nation produced 314 million kilograms of the leaf, the
board said in January.  Rains have eased a drought that had cut agricultural
production in Kenya, which relies on the industry to provide a
quarter of its gross domestic product. Tea output in the first
eight months of this year jumped 43 percent from a year earlier,
 Sicily Kariuki , the managing director of the board, told
reporters today.  Output surged to 260 million kilograms in the January-to-
August period, from 182 million kilograms in the first eight
months of 2009, Kariuki said. The average auction price for tea
rose to $2.75 per kilogram from $2.57, she said.  “Compared to last year, global tea production has
experienced a recovery from the effects of drought across major
tea-producing countries,” Kariuki said.  Key export markets for Kenyan tea include Egypt, the U.K.,
Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sudan, Kariuki said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
