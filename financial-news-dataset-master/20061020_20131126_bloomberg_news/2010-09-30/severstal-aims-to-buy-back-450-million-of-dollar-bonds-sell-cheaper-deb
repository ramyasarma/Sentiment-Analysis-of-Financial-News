OAO Severstal, Russia’s largest
steelmaker, offered to buy back $450 million of dollar bonds,
more than a third of its 9.75 percent notes due in 2013, aiming
to refinance the amount with less expensive debt.  Offers from bondholders will be accepted until Oct. 28 for
a price of $1,097.50 to $1,127.50 per $1,000 note, the
steelmaker, controlled by billionaire  Alexei Mordashov , said in
a regulatory filing today. Severstal sold $1.25 billion of the
notes in 2008.  Barclays Bank Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc are managing the transaction and may arrange the
sale of new debt, Severstal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
