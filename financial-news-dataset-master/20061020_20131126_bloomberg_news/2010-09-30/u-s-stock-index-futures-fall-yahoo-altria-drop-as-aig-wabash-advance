U.S. stocks fell, trimming the
biggest September gain since 1939 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index , as investors sold some of the month’s best-performing
shares amid speculation that improving economic data will reduce
the need for the Federal Reserve to stimulate growth.  Caterpillar Inc., which has rallied 21 percent in September
for the top gain in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , fell 1.6
percent to lead the 30-stock gauge lower today along with
biggest decliner American Express Co., which fell 2.3 percent.
Apple Inc., up 17 percent this month, slumped 1.3 percent.
Occidental Petroleum Corp. gained 2.2 percent, leading a measure
of energy stocks to the only rise among 10 groups in the S&P 500.  The  S&P 500  slipped 0.3 percent to 1,141.20 at 4 p.m. in
New York, paring its monthly advance to 8.8 percent and its
third-quarter gain to 11 percent. The Dow slid 47.23 points, or
0.4 percent, to 10,788.05.  “Things were due for a pause, this being the last day of
the quarter,” said  Michael James , a managing director at
Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. “Nothing goes up in a
straight line,” he said. “We’ve had a hard time making an
attempt at higher highs. You’re seeing traders exit positions
and lock in gains for the quarter.”  All 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 and all 30 stocks in
the Dow have gained in September, turning both measures positive
for 2010, amid speculation the world’s largest economy will
avoid slipping back into a recession and bets that the Federal
Reserve will buy more debt to support the recovery.  ‘Profit Taking’  Even after the rally, the S&P 500’s valuation of 12.5 times
projected earnings over the next 12 months compares with a 16.5
average since 1954 using reported results, according to  data
compiled by Bloomberg .  “With U.S. equities up a lot this month and this quarter,
there’s some quarter-end balancing,” said  Giri Cherukuri , money
manager and head trader at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle,
Illinois, which manages $2.2 billion. “People had a lot of
gains on the books, so it’s a little bit of profit-taking at
month-end.”  Stocks climbed earlier as government data showed the U.S.
economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter,
faster than the 1.6 percent previously estimated. Initial
jobless claims decreased by 16,000 to 453,000 in the week ended
Sept. 25, lower than the median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. The Institute for Supply-Management Chicago
Inc. said business activity unexpectedly accelerated.  ISM Tomorrow  Stocks began paring gains as a measure of  factories  in the
Milwaukee region trailed estimates, spurring concern that
tomorrow’s ISM national manufacturing index will lag behind
forecasts.  Philadelphia Fed President  Charles Plosser  said yesterday
he opposes more monetary expansion to support the economy in
part because he sees “little risk” of deflation. Boston Fed
President  Eric Rosengren  said further large-scale purchases of
securities would depend on the outlook and incoming data.  “The market’s been in a denial rally,” said  Scott Armiger ,
who helps manage about $5.6 billion at Christiana Bank & Trust
in Greenville, Delaware. “It’s overrated the good data and
underrated the bad data. I’m kind of worried about October,” he
said. “Today’s the last day of the month. It may be some
‘September’s been great. Let’s take some money off the table.’”  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of earth-moving
equipment, slipped 1.6 percent to $78.68. American Express
declined 2.3 percent to $42.03. Apple, maker of the iPhone and
the iPad computer tablet, decreased 1.3 percent to $283.75.  Occidental Petroleum rose 2.2 percent to $78.30 as energy
stocks rose 0.1 percent. Crude oil advanced as much as $80.18, a
seven-week high, completing the biggest monthly gain since May
2009.  Prudential, AIG  Prudential Financial Inc.  fell 4.2 percent to $54.18. The
insurer said it expects the two Japanese life insurance units
it’s buying from American International Group Inc. to earn less
investment income because of Prudential’s lower tolerance for
risk.  AIG Star Life Insurance Co. and AIG Edison Life Insurance
Co. would have earned about $100 million less on investments
last year if Prudential were managing the portfolios,  Mark Grier ,
vice chairman of the Newark, New Jersey-based insurer, said
today on a conference call with analysts.  AIG rose 4.4 percent to $39.10, the second- biggest gain  in
the S&P 500, as the rescued insurer agreed to wind down its
$182.3 billion bailout by converting the government’s stake into
common shares for sale. The U.S. Treasury Department will
convert its preferred stake of about $49.1 billion for 1.66
billion shares of common stock and then sell the holdings in the
open market.  Hertz, Education Stocks  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. fell the most in the Russell
1000 Index, dropping 8.8 percent to $10.59. Dollar Thrifty
Automotive Group Inc.’s  shareholders  rejected the car rental
company’s $1.46 billion takeover offer a day after Avis Budget
Group Inc. added a breakup fee to its higher bid.  For-profit education stocks rose after Senator  Tom Harkin 
said today at a hearing into the schools’ practices that the
dropout rate at 16 for-profit schools was 57 percent over a
three-year period. DeVry Inc. rose 5 percent to $49.21, the
biggest gain in the S&P 500.  Staffing companies advanced after the bigger-than-expected
decrease in jobless claims. Monster Worldwide Inc. climbed 1.3
percent to $12.96. Robert Half International Inc. rose 2.4
percent to $26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
