The highest-returning stocks of the
bull market are trailing the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  in
September as investors book profits, anticipating that Congress
will let tax cuts on capital gains expire at year-end.  About 250 of the largest American companies offer a
dividend yield of at least 3 percent after rallying more than 50
percent since March 9, 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Those stocks rose 6.8 percent on average in September, compared
with the S&P 500’s gain of 9.1 percent, Bloomberg data show.  The shares may face losses in October as investors dump
stocks that might be subject to higher taxes, according to  Leo Grohowski , chief investment officer at  Bank of New York Mellon 
Corp.’s wealth management unit, and  Brian Jacobsen  of  Wells
Fargo  Asset Management. Capital gains and dividend reductions
enacted under President  George W. Bush  in 2003 will expire in
three months unless  Barack Obama  and Congress extend them.  “We’ve seen an accelerated desire to harvest gains among
investors who have large profits,” said Grohowski, who oversees
$150 billion as chief investment officer at the Bank of New York
division in Boston. “We see a number of clients who want to
sell stocks where they have gains, not wanting to take a chance
on the risk of much higher taxes.”  Heading Higher  Client selling has started and may accelerate in companies
such as Downers Grove, Illinois-based  Sara Lee Corp. , which
gained 111 percent including payouts since the end of the bear
market on March 9, 2009, said Grohowski. Whitehouse Station, New
Jersey-based  Merck & Co. , with its 4.1 percent dividend yield,
is vulnerable, according to Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist
for the mutual fund division of Wells Fargo Asset Management,
which oversees $467 billion in San Francisco.  Congress set a 15 percent tax rate in 2003 on capital gains
for assets owned at least a year. Short-term profits are taxed
at an individual’s top ordinary rate, as high as 35 percent.
Previously, the capital gains tax on assets held between one and
five years was 20 percent and 18 percent when held five years or
more. The 2003 law also reduced the tax on many dividends to 15
percent from ordinary income tax rates up to 35 percent.  Because Republicans are favored to control a majority of
House seats after the Nov. 2 vote, the fate of the Bush tax cuts
may depend on which party controls the Senate, where Democrats
have a 59-41 majority. The Republicans stand to gain  five seats 
while six elections are toss-ups, according to poll averages
compiled by Real Clear Politics, a political website. The
minority party needs to pick up 10 seats to gain control.  Capturing Gains  “Investors are capturing long-term capital gains now at
the known rate of 15 percent instead of waiting to see what
those rates will be like in 2011,” said Jacobsen. “It’s sad
that so many decisions are driven by tax considerations instead
of being driven by what is most economically efficient.”  Alan Kufeld, a New York-based principal at accounting firm
Rothstein Kass & Co., offered an example of an investor who has
held 10,000 Sara Lee shares since March 9, 2009. Sold now, the
capital gain tax would be $10,200. Sold next year after the cuts
expire, the bill would be $13,600.  “We’re telling clients to consider accelerating gains now,
because rates are lower, and possibly deferring losses so when
rates go up, which we do feel they will, at least they can get a
better bang for the buck,” Kufeld said.  Among the 3,000 largest U.S. companies, about 250 are
paying at least 3 percent annually and have climbed 50 percent
or more since the S&P 500 began to rise from a 12-year low in
March 2009. On average, they yield 5.3 percent and are up 129
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Sara Lee, Merck  While Sara Lee, the maker of Ball Park hot dogs and
Hillshire Farm meat products, has more than doubled over the
past 18 months, it has dropped 5.6 percent in September. Merck,
the second-largest U.S. drugmaker, has risen 5.6 percent this
month, extending its gain since March 2009 to 75 percent. The S&P
500 is heading for the biggest September rally since 1939.  Stocks post below-average returns in years when capital-
gains taxes are raised, according to Leuthold Group LLC, which
has studied the market’s performance since 1917. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  rose 4.8 percent on average in the 11 years
when the tax went up, trailing the 14.7 percent advance in the
10 years when the tax was lowered, Leuthold data showed.  “The difference in performance suggests that the stock
market could face an uphill battle in 2011 when that cap gains
tax increase goes into effect,”  Doug Ramsey , Leuthold’s
director of research in Minneapolis, wrote in a note in July.  Tax Selling  Obama’s administration will most likely allow tax cuts for
the wealthiest Americans to expire after 2010, said  Barry Knapp ,
chief U.S. equity strategist at Barclays Plc in New York. Should
that happen, the S&P 500 may lose 100 points or more because the
highest-paid individuals own three quarters of the market, Knapp
estimated. The index closed yesterday at 1,144.73, compared with
its record high of 1,565.15 in October 2007 and the low of
676.53 in March 2009.  At the end of the first quarter, about $10.4 trillion of
stocks owned by American households and non-profit
organizations, or 61 percent, were taxable, Barclays data show.  Tax concerns aren’t enough to spur most investors to sell,
said  Todd M. Morgan , chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC
in Los Angeles, which manages $5 billion. Morgan predicted any
increase will be small and said the only people inclined to
divest would be company insiders, he said.  “If you told me capital gains are going back to 30
percent, we’ll have a different conversation,” he said. “But
going to 15 to 20, it’s not going to change people’s investment
soundness. It’s more important for people that are founders and
people that own huge blocks of stocks.”  The possibility of higher taxes has been enough to chase
some managers away from the market, said  Michael Yoshikami , who
oversees about $1 billion at YCMNet Advisors in Walnut Creek,
California.  “Institutional investors are strongly considering taking
taxable capital gains this year rather than next year,” he
said. “The likelihood of rising taxes does create a temptation
for us to go ahead and take taxable gains this year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
