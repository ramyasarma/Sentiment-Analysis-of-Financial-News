Soybeans futures rose for the first
time in three sessions after a government report showed
increased export sales from the U.S., the world’s biggest
producer.  Sales jumped 60 percent to 1.738 million metric tons in the
week ended Sept. 23, compared with 1.084 million a week earlier,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report. China, the
biggest consumer, bought 75 percent of the total. Soybean prices
are up 19 percent from a year ago.  “Export demand is the driving force in soybeans,” said
 Charles Sernatinger , a vice president for Fortis Clearing
Americas LLC in Chicago. “China is buying every week, and boats
will be coming to the U.S. in October to load out supplies.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 7.75 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $11.0675 a bushel at 1:31 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The most-active futures jumped 23
percent in the past three months, the first quarterly gain this
year and the biggest since 2008.  On Sept. 27, the price reached $11.44, an eight-month high,
on speculation that rains may damage U.S. crops and dry weather
would delay planting in South America.  Earlier today, soybeans fell as much as 1.5 percent on
speculation that favorable weather will speed the pace of
harvesting in the U.S. and boost planting and early crop
development in Brazil and Argentina.  Weather Forecast  Mostly dry weather is expected in the Midwest over the next
two weeks,  World Weather Inc.  said in a report today. Rains this
week will improve soil moisture in South America, particularly
in dry fields of central Brazil, the private forecaster said.
Brazil and Argentina are the biggest producers and exporters
after the U.S.  U.S. production will total 3.483 billion bushels, up 3.7
percent from a record 3.359 billion last year, the Department of
Agriculture said on Sept. 10. The government is scheduled to
update its forecast on Oct. 8.  The U.S. soybean crop was valued at $31.8 billion last
year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
