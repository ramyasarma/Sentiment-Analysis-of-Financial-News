Transocean Ltd.  bonds soared and
were the most traded in the U.S., as  BP Plc ’s debt offering this
week signaled renewed investor confidence in companies involved
in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  Transocean’s $900 million of 6.5 percent securities due in
2020 rose 3.1 cents to 108.9 cents on the dollar as of 3:16 p.m.
in New York, the highest since the securities were issued on
Sept. 16, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The energy company,
based in Vernier, Switzerland, owns the rig that exploded in
April, leading to the largest offshore U.S. oil spill.  “We’re seeing a break in the pessimism which pervaded the
Gulf of Mexico oil spill situation now that the news has
faded,” said  Guy LeBas , chief fixed-income strategist and
economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.  The performance of BP’s offering “points to improving
credit quality among companies exposed to Gulf spill clean-up
costs,”  he said.  BP’s $3.5 billion of bonds, the first sold since the spill
started, have risen above par since being issued on Sept. 28,
Trace data show. The energy company is based in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
