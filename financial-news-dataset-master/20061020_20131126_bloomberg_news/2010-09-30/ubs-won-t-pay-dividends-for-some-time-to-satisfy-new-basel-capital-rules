UBS AG , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
may resume dividend payments in 2013 or 2014, depending on new
Swiss capital requirements due for release in four days, Chief
Financial Officer  John Cryan  said.  “The dividend commencement date is a little uncertain,”
Cryan told investors at a conference in London today. “Sometime
in the period of Basel III introduction we’ll be able to resume
our returns to shareholders in the form of a dividend or even
share buyback. I’d be expecting by 2013-14 to be in a position
where we’re comfortably on track” to meet requirements “unless
something extraordinary comes out on Monday.”  A Swiss commission on too-big-to-fail issues will probably
announce a “more stringent” capital requirement for Zurich-
based UBS and local rival Credit Suisse Group AG on Oct. 4,
Cryan said. UBS hasn’t paid a dividend for two years and
distributed a stock dividend for 2007 instead of cash payments
to rebuild capital eroded by more than $57 billion in writedowns
and losses from the credit crisis.  UBS shares fell 2.2 percent to 16.68 Swiss francs in Zurich
trading. The 54-company Bloomberg  Europe Banks and Financial
Services Index  declined 0.6 percent.  Cryan said the bank has no intention of selling shares to
meet new capital requirements. Assuming that risk-weighted
assets jump to about 400 billion francs ($409 billion) under
Basel III rules and the bank accumulates earnings, as forecast
by analysts, UBS may have an 11 percent core capital ratio in
2012 and 13 percent in 2013, he said.  Earnings Forecast  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on Sept. 12 set
the new minimum ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets
for banks from 27 countries at 4.5 percent, plus a buffer of 2.5
percent. The new 7 percent requirement has to be met by 2019.  “Based on previously announced profitability targets, UBS
expects to satisfy the required core capital ratios through
retained earnings by 2013,” the bank said in a statement.  UBS intends to take “mitigating” steps, such as
offloading student loan auction rate securities, to bring its
risk-weighted assets closer to 300 billion francs under Basel
III rules, Cryan said. He also reiterated that the bank aims to
make a pretax profit of 15 billion francs by 2012 or 2013, ahead
of analysts’ current estimates.  The bank may be able to pay a dividend of 80 centimes per
share already for 2012, Morgan Stanley analysts  Huw van Steenis 
and  Hubert Lam  forecast last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
