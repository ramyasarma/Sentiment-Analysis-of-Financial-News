Canadian stocks  rose, extending a
weekly gain, as commodity prices rose for an eighth day after
measures of U.S. income and spending and Chinese manufacturing
advanced more than most economists forecast.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
increased 1 percent as the metal climbed on a weaker U.S.
dollar. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-largest
energy company by market value, climbed 1.6 percent as crude oil
rallied from a seven-week high. Questerre Energy Corp., which is
developing shale-gas deposits in Quebec, plunged 27 percent
after announcing project delays.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index , rose 69.46
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,438.11 as of 9:39 a.m. in Toronto,
the highest level on an intraday basis since September 2008.  The S&P/TSX  surged  9.5 percent last quarter, the biggest
quarterly gain since the three months ending September 2009. The
market was led by fertilizer stocks, which soared 58 percent
thanks to BHP Billiton Ltd.’s $40 billion unsolicited bid for
Potash Corp., and base-metals and coal companies, which jumped
43 percent as a group on higher copper prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
