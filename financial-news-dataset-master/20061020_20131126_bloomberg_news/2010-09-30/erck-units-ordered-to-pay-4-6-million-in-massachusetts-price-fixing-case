Merck & Co.  units were ordered to
pay $4.6 million over a lawsuit brought by Massachusetts that
claimed they inflated wholesale prices of Proventil generics.  A federal-court jury in Boston today found in favor of the
state over Schering Corp. and Warrick Pharmaceuticals, units of
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck. The judge has the
discretion to triple the award.  Massachusetts claimed the companies reported inflated
wholesale acquisition-cost prices for the generics, and that
MassHealth, the state component of the Medicaid program, would
rely on those prices for reimbursements.  “The company intends to vigorously pursue a reversal of
the verdict in the trial court and on appeal if necessary,”
said  Bruce Kuhlik , Merck’s general counsel. “We strongly
believe the evidence showed that the Commonwealth made informed
choices about the amounts it paid to Massachusetts pharmacists
and that Warrick was in no way responsible for these choices.”  Representatives of the state didn’t immediately return
messages seeking comment.  Merck fell 31 cents to $36.81 today in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading .  The case is Massachusetts v. Mylan Laboratories, 03-cv-
11865, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
