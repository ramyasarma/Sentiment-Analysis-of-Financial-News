Mexico’s peso posted its biggest
monthly gain since May 2009 after U.S. housing and employment
data eased concern the country’s biggest export market may
return to recession.  The peso rose 4.9 percent to 12.5935 per dollar at 4 p.m.
New York time, from 13.2046 on Aug. 31, the best-performing
major Latin American currency tracked by Bloomberg.  Initial  jobless claims  in the U.S. decreased more than
forecast, by 16,000 to 453,000 in the week ended Sept. 25.
Builders broke ground on 598,000 homes at an annual rate in
August, up 10.5 percent and the most since April.  “All the fears of a double-dip recession in the U.S. are
dissipating,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency strategist at Base
Internacional Casa de Bolsa SA in Monterrey, Mexico. “I see a
positive outlook for the rest of the year.”  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.39 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.5 centavo to 133.58 centavos per peso.  “Mexico’s escalating crime problems have effectively
become a clear threat to the strength of the recovery,” Credit
Suisse Group AG economist  Alonso Cervera  wrote in a report e-
mailed today. “The peso would probably be stronger if the
country was safer.”  At least 28,000 people have been killed during President
 Felipe Calderon’s  administration in violence tied to organized
crime. The number of deaths related to criminal groups totaled
about 4,250 in the second quarter, an 85 percent increase from
the same period a year earlier, according to figures from a
government report released in July.  Dollar Options  The peso will remain within the 12.40-to-13.30 range
against the dollar this year, Credit Suisse said.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. This month, $597
million of dollar options were exercised. The bank has been
auctioning $600 million monthly in options, allowing it to buy
dollars as it seeks to raise foreign currency reserves after the
peso reached a record low last year.  Banco de Mexico sold $600 million in dollar options that
can be executed in October today, according to the central
bank’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
