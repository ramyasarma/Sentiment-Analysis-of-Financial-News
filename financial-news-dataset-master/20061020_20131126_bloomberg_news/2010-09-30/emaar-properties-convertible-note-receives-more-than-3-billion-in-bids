Emaar Properties PJSC, the biggest
publicly traded real-estate developer in the United Arab
Emirates, said its five-year convertible note sale received more
than $3 billion in bids.  The offer received 250 orders from investors globally, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. “The base size of
the offering was fully subscribed within an hour of launch and
the order book was closed within three hours of launch,” it
said.  Emaar yesterday raised $450 million from the note sale with
an option to raise the size to $500 million. JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Standard Chartered Plc
managed the sale and the securities will be listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
