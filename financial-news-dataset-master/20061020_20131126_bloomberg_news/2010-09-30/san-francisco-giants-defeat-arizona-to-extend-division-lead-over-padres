The Tampa Bay Rays lost the opener of
a season-ending series at Kansas City to fall into a tie for
first place in the American League East with the New York
Yankees.  The Rays, who began last night with a half-game advantage
over the idle Yankees, were held to six hits by three Royals
pitchers in the 3-2 loss.  The Rays and Yankees have clinched playoff spots. One will
be the AL East champion and the other will be the league’s wild
card. Tampa finishes the season with three more games in Kansas
City, while the Yankees have a three-game series starting
tonight at Boston.  The San Francisco Giants clinched at least a tie for the
National League West division title by winning 4-1 at home
against Arizona while the second-place San Diego Padres lost 1-0
at home to the Chicago Cubs.  Buster Posey ,  Pablo Sandoval  and  Andres Torres  hit home
runs for the Giants, who completed a three-game sweep of the
Diamondbacks. It was the fourth straight win for the Giants.  The Giants’ victory, coupled with the Padres’ loss,
extended San Francisco’s division lead to three games. The
Padres and Giants complete the Major League Baseball regular
season with a three-game series starting tonight in San
Francisco.  San Diego also fell two games behind Atlanta in the race
for the NL wild-card spot. Atlanta, which was off yesterday,
completes its regular season with a three-game series at home
against NL East champion Philadelphia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
