Fewer New Zealand companies are
 optimistic  about the economy and firms are scaling back hiring
and investment intentions, according to a survey.  A net 14 percent of companies surveyed this month expect
the economy will be stronger in a year’s time, down from 16
percent in August, according to ANZ National Bank Ltd. The net
figure subtracts the number of pessimists from optimists.  Falling hiring and investment intentions add to signs that
economic growth will remain weak after gross domestic product
expanded just 0.2 percent in the second quarter. Central bank
Governor  Alan Bollard  this month kept borrowing costs unchanged
and lowered his growth forecasts.  “The message is clear, businesses consider themselves to
be in a hold pattern,”  Cameron Bagrie , chief economist at ANZ
National in Wellington, said in an e-mailed statement.  “A real
danger at present is that declining confidence or overly
cautious stances become self fulfilling.”  The survey of 506 firms showed a net 26.7 percent expect
their own business activity to improve, up from 25.7 percent in
August. Still, adjusting for seasonal factors the measure fell
to 19 percent from 28 percent, Bagrie said. The direction is
clear, he said.  The number of firms planning to hire workers about equaled
those who may fire staff, and a net 1.9 percent intent to
increase investment, the survey showed.  “In this situation, the Reserve Bank has scope to take a
supportive stance by keeping interest rates low,” Bagrie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
