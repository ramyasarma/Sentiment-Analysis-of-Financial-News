Ahluwalia Contracts Ltd. , an Indian
company that helped build athletes’ housing for the Commonwealth
Games, plans to spend as much as 1 billion rupees ($22 million)
buying companies involved in the construction business.  “The trend for all construction companies is positive as
the government is bullish on infrastructure spending,” Chief
Financial Officer  S.K. Sachdeva  said in a phone interview today.  Ahluwalia’s earnings may be buoyed by increased government
spending on new roads, ports, schools and mass transit systems.
India’s Planning Commission estimates $1 trillion needs to be
spent in the five years from 2012 on such projects to narrow the
gap with China, the world’s fastest growing major economy.  The shares  rose  2.8 percent to 209 rupees as of 2:06 p.m.
local time. The stock has added 8.6 percent this year, compared
with the Bombay Stock Exchange BSE500 Index’s 16 percent gain.  The company plans to buy “mid-sized” companies
specializing in building water treatment systems, concrete roads
and power plants, Sachdeva said.  Ahluwalia got new orders worth 4.76 billion rupees, it said
in a stock exchange filing today. Sachdeva said he expects to
get another 3 billion rupees in orders to build hotels,
residences and hospitals by early November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
