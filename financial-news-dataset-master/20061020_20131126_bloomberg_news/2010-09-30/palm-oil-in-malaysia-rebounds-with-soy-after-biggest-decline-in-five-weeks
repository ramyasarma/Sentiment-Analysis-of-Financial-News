Palm oil, poised to post its first
quarterly gain in three, climbed ahead of a report on U.S.
inventories of soybeans, used to make a rival oil.  December-delivery palm oil gained as much as 1.5 percent to
2,738 ringgit ($887) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and was at 2,735 ringgit at 4:07 p.m. Prices dropped
1.4 percent yesterday, the biggest fall since Aug. 24. Soybean
oil and palm oil can be used as substitutes in food and fuel.  “For this week, the strong correlation between crude palm
oil and Chicago soybeans is likely to remain,” said  Ker Chung Yang , an investment analyst at Philip Futures Pte.  Soybeans in Chicago advanced for the first time in three
days, gaining as much as 0.9 percent to $11.09 a bushel ahead of
a U.S. Department of Agriculture inventory report today for
soybeans, corn and wheat. Soybeans traded at $11.0625 a bushel.  “Should Chicago soybeans re-ignite another rally after
the release of USDA quarterly stocks report, we expect crude
palm oil to break above 2,750 ringgit levels,” Ker said.  Reserves of U.S. soybeans are forecast to reach 151 million
bushels as of Sept. 1, from 138 million a year earlier,
according to a survey of 19 analysts by Bloomberg News.  Palm oil climbed 15 percent this quarter, the most since
the fourth quarter of 2009, as demand increased before festivals
and excess rain hurt harvests, causing stockpiles to drop in the
seven months through July.  Malaysia’s palm oil exports rose 30 percent in September
from a month earlier to 1.5 million tons, estimated Societe
Generale de Surveillance, an independent cargo surveyor today.  Festival Demand  Exports to China, the biggest consumer of edible oils,
surged to 268,770 tons from 153,350 tons, while exports to
Pakistan jumped to 203,040 tons from 111,670 tons in August, the
data showed. China marks National Day with a week’s holiday
starting tomorrow. Pakistan’s orders were spurred by the Muslim
Eid holidays early in September.  Heavy rain in Malaysia and Indonesia, the largest palm oil
growers, have been “curbing crude palm oil producers’
harvesting ability and leading to significant logistic
challenges,” causing supply concerns that supported prices,
Credit Suisse analyst  Teddy Oetomo  said today.  Still, Malaysian palm oil  reserves  climbed in August,
jumping 23 percent to 1.72 million tons from July, as output
rose a fourth month, the country’s palm oil board said Sept. 15.  India’s monsoon, the main source of irrigation for 235
million farmers, may be the best in three years after La Nina
increased precipitation in August and September, according to
the state-run forecaster. Showers in the central states, the
biggest producers of soybeans, were 4 percent above normal.  CME Group Inc.’s December palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, climbed 1.4 percent to $881.50 a ton.
On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, May-delivery palm oil rose 0.8
percent to 7,746 yuan ($1,158) a ton for a 21 percent surge for
the quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
