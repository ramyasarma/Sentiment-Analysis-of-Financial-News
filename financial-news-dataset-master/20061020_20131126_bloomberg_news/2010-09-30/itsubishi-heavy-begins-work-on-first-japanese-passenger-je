Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. 
said it began work on building Japan’s first regional passenger
jet to challenge  Bombardier Inc.  and  Empresa Brasileira de
Aeronautica SA  for orders for the aircraft.  Workers started cutting aluminum for the aircraft’s
horizontal stabilizer, according to a  statement  posted today on
Mitsubishi Heavy’s website. The aircraft’s first flight is set
for 2012, the statement said.  Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp., the unit which is making the
plane, plans to open more sales offices as it forecasts demand
for 70- to 90-seat jets to increase over the next 20 years. The
company, which aims to sell 1,000 aircraft over two decades, in
June said it had as many as 125 orders for its Mitsubishi
Regional Jet or MRJ.  The  MRJ  will be powered by engines from United Technologies
Corp.’s Pratt & Whitney, which will help make the plane 20
percent more fuel efficient than regional jets currently flying,
according to Mitsubishi Aircraft. The aircraft is designed to
have a range of 3,410 kilometers (2,119 miles), enabling it to
reach anywhere in the mainland U.S. from Chicago.  Customers include All Nippon Airways Co., which has ordered
25 planes. Mitsubishi Heavy, which counted on aerospace for
about 17 percent of  revenue  in the 12 months ended March 31,
also builds the carbon-fiber wings for Boeing Co.’s 787
Dreamliner.  Mitsubishi Heavy  fell 0.3 percent to 316 yen as of 12:36
p.m. in Tokyo trading.  Bombardier , based in Montreal, and Embraer, as the
Brazilian company is known, are the world’s third- and fourth-
largest aircraft makers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
