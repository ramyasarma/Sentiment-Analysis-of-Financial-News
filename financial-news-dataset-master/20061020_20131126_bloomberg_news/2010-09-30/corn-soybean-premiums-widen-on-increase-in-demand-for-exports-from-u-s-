Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans widened relative to
Chicago futures on higher demand for newly harvested crops in
the Midwest.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
September was 40 cents to 44 cents a bushel above December
futures yesterday, compared with 37 cents to 40 cents yesterday,
 government data show . The  average spot premium  was the highest
in five weeks. Soybean premiums widened to 54 cents to 60 cents
above November futures, up from 54 cents to 58 cents.  “We have an aggressive export program the next three
months, and some exporters may be trying to get some extra
supplies,” said  Diana Klemme , the director of the grain
division at Grain Service Corp., a consulting and brokerage
company in Atlanta. “The harvest is not at the moment
overwhelming demand.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 9.25 cents, or 1.8
percent, to close at $4.9575 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $4.7825, the lowest level
since Sept. 13. The grain surged 33 percent in the third
quarter.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 7.75 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $11.0675 a bushel. The price jumped 23
percent in the third quarter.  Shipping volumes will increase in October, the USDA said
today in a  report . Forty-seven vessels were loaded with grain
and soybeans at terminals near New Orleans in the week ended
Sept. 23, up 31 percent from the same period a week earlier.
About 63 ships are expected to be loaded in the next 10 days, up
7 percent from last year.  U.S. railroads shipped 23,177 carloads of grain to
exporters and processors in the week ended Sept. 25, up 19
percent from a year earlier, the Association of American
Railroads said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
