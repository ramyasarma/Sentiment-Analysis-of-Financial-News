India’s stocks rose, with the
benchmark index completing its longest stretch of quarterly
gains, as the nation’s economic growth and corporate earnings
lured investors to increase their holdings to a record.  Housing Development Finance Corp. , the biggest mortgage
lender, rose 3.2 percent. Overseas  funds  bought a net  8.95
billion rupees  ($198.3 million) of Indian equities on Sept. 28,
extending this year’s record inflows to 843.6 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  Hindalco Industries
Ltd. , the biggest aluminum producer, climbed 2.3 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 97.37, or 0.5 percent, to 20,053.71, according to
preliminary closing prices. The gauge rose for a seventh
quarter, its best such rally. The measure has climbed 13 percent
this quarter, the second-best performer among the world’s 10
biggest markets.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.5 percent to 6,023.25. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.1 percent
to 2,529.37.  -- Editor: Margo Towie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
