Asian currencies had their biggest
quarterly advance since 2004 as the world’s fastest economic
growth lured funds to the region and yuan appreciation made
policy makers more tolerant of gains.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index  closed yesterday
at a two-year high and stock markets in India, South Korea and
Taiwan have since the end of August attracted more than $11
billion from overseas. China’s yuan yesterday reached its
strongest level since 1993, while Thailand’s baht and Malaysia’s
ringgit today touched 13-year highs.  “Asia benefits from the move out of slowing developed
markets into developing markets,” said  Douglas Borthwick ,
Stamford, Connecticut-based managing director and head of
foreign-exchange trading at Faros Trading LLC. “Other central
banks in the region that are also conducting daily interventions
and smoothing efforts will continue to follow China’s lead,
slowly allowing their currencies to strengthen.”  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-
used currencies excluding the yen, was 3.6 percent higher for
the quarter as of 4:14 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. South Korea’s won has strengthened 7.2
percent to 1,140.20 versus the greenback and the baht gained 6.7
percent to 30.36, the region’s best performances. All of Asia’s
10 most-used currencies appreciated.  Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.2 percent in 2010,
outpacing growth of 2.6 percent in advanced countries, the
International Monetary Fund forecast in July. The Manila-based
Asian Development Bank on Sept. 28 raised this year’s growth
forecast for the region to 8.2 percent from an April estimate of
7.5 percent.  Yuan Gains  The Chinese government will “further improve” its
exchange-rate mechanism and “increase the flexibility” of the
yuan, the People’s Bank of China said yesterday in a statement.
The U.S. House of Representatives later voted 348-79 for a
measure that would let domestic companies petition for duties on
imports from China to compensate for the effect of a weak yuan.  The Chinese currency has appreciated 2 percent to 6.6901
per dollar since a two-year peg to the dollar was scrapped on
June 19, gaining 1.8 percent this month alone. It yesterday
reached 6.6825, the strongest level since official and market
exchange rates were unified at the end of 1993, after U.S.
President Barack Obama criticized China for using an undervalued
currency to gain an unfair trade advantage.  Appreciation in the yuan reduces the incentive for policy
makers in South Korea and Taiwan to combat currency gains that
make it harder for their exporters to compete with Chinese
rivals. The won yesterday hit a four-month high of 1,139.84 per
dollar, while Taiwan’s dollar reached a two-year high of
NT$31.211. The latter currency has strengthened 3 percent since
the end of June.  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit advanced 4.5 percent this
quarter to 3.0868 versus the greenback and the Philippine peso
rose 5.5 percent to 43.955, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Indonesia’s rupiah appreciated 1.7 percent to 8,913
and the Singapore dollar climbed 6 percent to S$1.3155.  To contact the reporter on this story:
