The euro may end its two-week rally
against Japan’s currency as it approaches resistance between
114.05 yen and 114.45 yen, Barclays Bank Plc said, citing
trading patterns.  The 114.05 yen level is a 38.2 percent retracement of the
euro’s decline from an April 5 high of 127.92 yen to the Aug. 24
low of 105.44 yen, based on a series of numbers known as the
Fibonacci sequence. The level of 114.45 yen represents the highs
of May 21 and July 27, according to a chart compiled by Barclays.
A stochastic oscillator chart also shows the euro’s 1.5 percent
gain in the past two weeks may be excessive.  “Stochastics are signaling the euro is overbought,” said
 Masafumi Yamamoto , chief currency strategist at Barclays Bank in
Tokyo. “Look for stalling into the range highs. A break of
support at 111.45 would confirm a near-term high.”  The euro traded at 113.88 yen as of 10:46 a.m. in Tokyo
after rising to 114.23 yen earlier today, the strongest since
July 29. The single currency has advanced 5.2 percent versus the
yen this quarter.  Barclays’s chart shows the euro may gain support at around
111.45 yen, the low set on Sept. 21. Support refers to an area
where buy orders may be clustered. Resistance is where there may
be orders to sell.  The European currency’s 14-day stochastic oscillator versus
the yen was at 95 today, above the 80 threshold that signals it
may have risen too fast and is poised to weaken.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance or below support indicates a currency may
move to the next level.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study chart
of trading patterns and prices to forecast price changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
