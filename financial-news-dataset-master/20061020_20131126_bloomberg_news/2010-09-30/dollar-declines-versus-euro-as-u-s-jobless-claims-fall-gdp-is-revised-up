The dollar weakened against the
majority of its most-traded counterparts after stronger-than-
forecast reports on the U.S. economy fueled demand for riskier
assets.  The U.S. currency touched a five-month low against the euro
as U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly fell, second-quarter
economic growth was revised higher and a regional purchasing
managers survey was stronger than forecast. The yen traded near
its strongest level versus the euro and greenback since Sept. 15
when the Bank of Japan sold $25 billion to weaken its currency.  “It’s seen as a risk-on event,” said  Sebastien Galy , a
currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York. “The U.S.
economy is performing a little bit better than you would expect.
We’re seeing the dollar weaken.”  The dollar was little changed at $1.3629 per euro at 10:16
a.m. in New York, after touching $1.3683, the weakest level
since April 12, from $1.3627 yesterday. The greenback
strengthened to 83.51 yen from 83.70 yen yesterday, and touched
83.17 yen, the lowest since Sept. 15. The euro weakened to
113.89 yen from 114.06 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
