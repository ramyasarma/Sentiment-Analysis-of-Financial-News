Canadian Finance Minister Jim
Flaherty will scale back plans to withdraw stimulus by limiting
proposed increases to payroll taxes to 5 cents per C$100 of
insurable earnings next year.  Flaherty spoke to reporters in Ottawa today.  The Conservatives created a panel in 2008, the Canada
Employment Insurance Financing Board, to set rates for premiums.  To contact the reporter on this story:
