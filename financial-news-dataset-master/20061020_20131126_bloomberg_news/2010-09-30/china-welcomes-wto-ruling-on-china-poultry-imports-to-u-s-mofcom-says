China welcomed the World Trade
Organization’s ruling on U.S. restrictions on imports of Chinese
poultry, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its
website today, citing spokesman Yao Jian.  China said its poultry is “safe” and called for the U.S.
to conduct fair assessment and tests on the meat, according to
the statement.  The WTO said yesterday that U.S. restrictions on imports of
Chinese chicken, turkey and duck break some global commerce
rules.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
