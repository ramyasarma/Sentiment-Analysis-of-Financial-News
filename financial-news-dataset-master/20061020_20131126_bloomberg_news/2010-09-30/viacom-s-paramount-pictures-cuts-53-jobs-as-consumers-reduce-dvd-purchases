Viacom Inc. ’s Paramount Pictures
plans to eliminate 53 jobs in areas including home entertainment
and digital production as consumers reduce spending on DVDs.  The job cuts represent about 2 percent of the Los Angeles-
based studio’s 2,600 employees. Paramount notified employees of
the cuts today in a memo confirmed by outside spokesman  Steven Rubenstein . They were previously reported by TheWrap.com.  Paramount is restructuring four units and eliminating
overlapping roles as consumers shift from buying DVDs to viewing
videos online and on mobile devices. The studio posted a $69
million  profit  in the June-ended quarter, after an $8 million
loss a year ago, because of lower costs from fewer new releases.  “The restructuring we are announcing today consolidates
our operations in a way that is consistent with how more of our
customers are exploring multiple facets of the film
experience,” Paramount Chief Operating Officer  Frederick Huntsberry  and Vice Chairman  Rob Moore  said in the memo.  Licensing and consumer products will merge into the Motion
Picture Promotions unit, the studio said. The production and
development of home entertainment and digital formats will
combine under Paramount Digital Entertainment. The distribution
of movies on digital platforms will be handled by Paramount
Pictures Worldwide Television Distribution.  Viacom, based in New York, fell 9 cents to $36.19 at 4:01
