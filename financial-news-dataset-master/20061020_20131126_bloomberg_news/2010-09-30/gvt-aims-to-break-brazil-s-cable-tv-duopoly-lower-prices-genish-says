GVT Holding SA  wants to break up
the “duopoly” in Brazil’s cable television market next year
and lower prices for consumers, Chief Executive Officer  Amos Genish  said.  The entrance of a new competitor into the industry divided
by Sky Brasil Servicos Ltda. and  Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA 
may lower prices by between 20 percent and 25 percent in the
first 18 months, Genish said. GVT will invest 200 million reais
($118 million) to offer cable television with broadband Internet
in the second quarter next year.  “GVT doesn’t want to wait any more to enter this segment
that has a duopoly,” Genish said in a Sept. 27 telephone
interview from Curitiba. “There has to be room for new
players.”  The television market in Brazil grew in the first eight
months of the year by 18 percent compared with the same period
in 2009 to 8.8 million houses, or 29.2 million people, according
to the country’s telecommunications regulator,  Anatel . Brazil’s
central bank expects the country to grow 7.3 percent this year,
according to the bank  quarterly inflation report  posted today on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
