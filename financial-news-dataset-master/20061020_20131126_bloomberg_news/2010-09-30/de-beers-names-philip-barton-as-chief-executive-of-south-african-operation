De Beers, the world’s second-
largest diamond miner, said  Barend Petersen  will replace  Nicky Oppenheimer  as executive chairman of its South African mining
operations and appointed  Phillip Barton  as chief executive
officer of the unit.  Oppenheimer will continue to serve as chairman for the
wider De Beers Group, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today. Petersen had been serving as acting CEO of the
South African unit, while Barton was its chief financial
officer.  Russia’s  ZAO Alrosa  is the world’s largest producer of
rough diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
