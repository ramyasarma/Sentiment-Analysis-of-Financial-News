Crude oil rose, capping the biggest
monthly gain since May 2009, after U.S. second-quarter gross
domestic product and weekly jobless claims beat economists’
estimates in signs that demand may improve.  Oil jumped to a seven-week high on a government report that
the world’s largest economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in
the second quarter. The price also gained as the decline in
jobless claims indicated that companies are cutting back on
firings and on an unexpected drop in gasoline stockpiles.  “The market is still viewed as economics-led,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. “People
are looking ahead to when the economy is going to recover and
demand is going to cause drawdowns in some of the inventories.”  Oil for November delivery gained $2.11, or 2.7 percent, to
settle at $79.97 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price ranged from $77.55 to $80.18, the highest price since
Aug. 11. Futures climbed 11 percent in September and 5.7 percent
in the third quarter.  The revised GDP figure exceeded the 1.6 percent median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Growth slowed
from 3.7 percent in the first quarter.  U.S. initial jobless claims decreased by 16,000 to 453,000
in the week ended Sept. 25, lower than the 460,000 median
forecast of 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, Labor
Department figures showed today in Washington. Unemployment has
hovered around 10 percent.  “When the data’s good, it really spurs crude on,” said
 Matt Smith , a commodities analyst for Summit Energy in
Louisville, Kentucky. “Crude’s still being latched onto as a
proxy for risk appetite.”  U.S. Business Activity  Business activity in the U.S. also accelerated unexpectedly
this month, according to the Institute for Supply Management-
Chicago Inc. The group said its business barometer climbed to
60.4 in September, exceeding the highest estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “People are starting to realize that economically, the
country is moving forward,” said  Carl Larry , president of Oil
Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “It’s all about demand.
Whether it’s small or large, it’s still coming, it’s still
growing, and that’s the key here.”  Gasoline Demand, Inventories  Gasoline  consumption  jumped 6.1 percent last week to 9.38
million barrels a day, the biggest one-week increase since Feb.
19, according to the Energy Department.  Stockpiles  of the motor fuel fell 3.47 million barrels to
222.6 million. They were forecast to increase by 350,000
barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Crude inventories
also slipped 475,000 barrels to 357.9 million.  “The initial factor for this move was U.S. oil storage
data, although I don’t see U.S. demand picking up enough for
prices to get much higher,” said  Gerrit Zambo , a trader at
Bayerische Landesbank in Munich.  Gasoline for October delivery gained 4.93 cents, or 2.5
percent, to expire at $2.0448 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
level since Aug. 10. The more-active November futures rose 5.32
cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.0361.  Oil output from OPEC, supplier of 40 percent of the world’s
crude, fell to an eight-month low in September, led by Iraq,
where a pipeline disruption curtailed shipments, a Bloomberg
News survey showed today.  OPEC Output  Production slipped 145,000 barrels, or 0.5 percent, to an
average 29.055 million barrels a day, the lowest level since
January, according to the survey. Output by members with quotas,
all except Iraq, dropped 95,000 barrels to 26.76 million, 1.92
million above their target.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
unlikely to change output levels when it meets next month,
Kuwait’s oil minister said.  Sheikh Ahmad al-Abdullah al-Sabah 
said in Hanoi yesterday that he is “happy” with current
prices. OPEC’s next ministerial meeting is Oct. 14 in Vienna.  The government of Ecuador, the smallest OPEC oil producer,
called for international help after what it called a “coup
attempt” today by members of its security forces. The
opposition is behind the attempt to take down the government,
according to a statement on the president’s website.  Ecuador pumped 465,000 barrels a day of crude this month,
or 1.6 percent of OPEC’s total, a Bloomberg News survey showed
today. OPEC’s current president is  Wilson Pastor , Ecuador’s
minister of non-renewable natural resources.  Ecuador exported 200,000 barrels a day of oil to the U.S.
in July, or 2 percent of total imports, based on the most recent
 monthly data  from the Energy Department.  Brent crude for November settlement gained $1.54, or 1.9
percent, to $82.31 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London,
the highest closing price since Aug. 3.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 776,736
contracts as of 3:46 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 794,709
contracts yesterday, 22 percent above the average of the past
three months and the highest level in more than two weeks. Open
interest was 1.34 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
