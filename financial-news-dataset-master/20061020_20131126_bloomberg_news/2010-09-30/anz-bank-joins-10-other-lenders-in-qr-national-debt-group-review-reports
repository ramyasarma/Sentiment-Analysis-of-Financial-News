Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. has joined ten other lenders as part of the debt group for
QR National ahead of its planned initial share sale, the
Australian Financial Review said in its Street Talk column.
Lenders were asked to commit in parcels of A$200 million, A$300
million or A$400 million, with the debt divided into three-year
and five-year blocks, the newspaper reported, without saying
where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
