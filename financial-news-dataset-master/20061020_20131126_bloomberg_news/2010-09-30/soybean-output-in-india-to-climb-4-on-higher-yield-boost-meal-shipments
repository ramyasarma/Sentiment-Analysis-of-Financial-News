Soybean production in India, Asia’s
top supplier of animal feed made from the oilseed, may increase
four percent next year as above-normal rainfall increases yield,
a processors’ group said.  Production may total 10.1 million metric tons in the year
starting Oct. 1,  Rajesh Agrawal , a coordinator for the Soybean
Processors Association of India, said in a telephone interview.
Average yield per hectare will increase 8 percent to 1,089
kilograms because of above-normal monsoon, he said.  A bigger harvest may increase exports from the South Asian
country and may pressure soybean-meal prices that have jumped 19
percent since the end of June in Chicago and lift earnings at
processors including  Ruchi Soya Industries Ltd.  and KS Oils Ltd.
India competes with the U.S., Argentina and Brazil to supply
animal feed to China, Vietnam, Japan and South Korea.  “Exports will increase next year because of the bigger
crop and there’s good demand for Indian meal today,” Agrawal
said. Shipments may reach 3.5 million tons next year, less than
the 4 million tons forecast on Sept. 13, he said.  Output in Madhya Pradesh, the biggest grower, may climb to
6.01 million tons from 5.51 million tons this year, Maharashtra,
the second-biggest, may harvest 2.75 million tons, less than the
2.98 million tons this year, according to the first crop
estimate by the processors’ association.  Rajasthan, the third biggest grower, may harvest 760,000
tons, 25 percent more than the 609,000 tons this season. Area
planted to the crop this year narrowed to 9.3 million hectares
from 9.67 million, Agrawal said.  Soybean meal futures for December delivery rose as much as
0.9 percent to $310.40 a short ton in electronic trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for delivery in October on the
National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange in Mumbai climbed as
much as 1.1 percent to 2,045 rupees per 100 kilograms.  Shipments of the meal in the year ending Sept. 30 may drop
to 2.9 million tons from 3.2 million a year earlier, as a surge
in domestic seed prices prompted buyers to shift to supplies
from South America and the U.S., according to SOPA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
