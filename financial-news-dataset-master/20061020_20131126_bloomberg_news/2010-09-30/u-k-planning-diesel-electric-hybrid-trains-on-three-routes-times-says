The U.K. plans to introduce hybrid
diesel/electric trains on three key routes, the London-based
Times reported.  The trains would be cheaper to run than standard diesel
locomotives and would reduce carbon emissions, the newspaper
said, citing bid documents it said it has seen. They would also
permit the government to move ahead with the complete
electrification of the railway in stages, the Times said.  The Bombardier Transportation division of Bombardier Inc.
is the lead partner in the bid, and plans to build 123
pantograph cars and convert 21 existing cars to accommodate the
technology, the newspaper said. At 1.3 million pounds ($2
million) to 1.6 million pounds a carriage, the company hopes to
win 300 million pounds in business for its plant in Derby,
central England, the Times said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
