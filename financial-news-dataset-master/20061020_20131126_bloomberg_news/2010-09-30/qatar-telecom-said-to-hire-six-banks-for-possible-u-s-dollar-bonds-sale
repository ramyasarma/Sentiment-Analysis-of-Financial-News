Qatar Telecom QSC  hired six banks
to help organize meetings with credit investors next month ahead
of a planned dollar bond sale, according to an e-mailed
statement from the company.  The meetings will run Oct. 4 to Oct. 6, with three teams
covering Singapore, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, New York, Boston,
Dubai and London, a person familiar with the matter said, asking
not to be identified as he isn’t authorized to discuss the
details.  A revival of investor confidence in the region has sparked
a wave of sales this month, helping to push Gulf issuance to
more than $9 billion in the third quarter, the most since the
$16 billion raised in the final three months of 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Dubai raised $1.25 billion yesterday in a two-part bond
sale in its first sovereign debt issue since the Dubai World
credit crisis roiled global markets, while Emaar Properties
PJSC, the biggest publicly traded real-estate developer in the
United Arab Emirates, increased a convertible bond sale to $450
million from $375 million.  The banks hired by Qatar Telecom are Barclays Plc, Deutsche
Bank AG, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Qatar National
Bank SAQ, Standard Chartered Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, according to the media statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
