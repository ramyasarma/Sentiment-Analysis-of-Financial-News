The pound rose against the dollar
and the euro as Bank of England policy maker  Adam Posen  said
further asset purchases are not a “foregone conclusion.”  The British currency rebounded from near its weakest
against the euro in four months as a report showed U.K. house
prices unexpectedly climbed in September. The Monetary Policy
Committee would need to decide whether additional so-called
quantitative easing would be needed, and “may even talk me out
of it,” Posen said in an interview with the Yorkshire Post
broadcast on the newspaper’s website today.  “The backtracking by Posen helped sterling move higher
today,” said  Adam Cole , global head of currency strategy at
Royal Bank of Canada Europe Ltd. in London. “The housing data
also helped.”  The pound strengthened 0.4 percent to 85.95 pence per euro
as of 8:39 a.m. in London. It reached 86.44 pence yesterday, the
weakest since May 24. Sterling climbed 0.3 percent to $1.5833
and was little changed at 132.06 yen.  The  average cost  of a home climbed by 0.1 percent to
166,757 pounds ($264,000) after a 0.8 percent drop in August,
Nationwide Building Society said today. From a year earlier,
prices increased 3.1 percent, the least since November 2009.  U.K. government bonds were little changed with the yield on
the 10-year gilt at 2.92 percent and two-year yields 1 basis
point higher at 0.64 percent.  Gilts lost 0.2 percent this month, trimming their quarterly
return to 4.2 percent, according to indexes compiled by Bank of
America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit. German government bonds
earned 2.2 percent this quarter, while U.S. Treasuries returned
2.7 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
