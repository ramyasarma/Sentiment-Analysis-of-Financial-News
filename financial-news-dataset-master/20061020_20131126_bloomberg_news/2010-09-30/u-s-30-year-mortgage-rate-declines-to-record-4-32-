Mortgage rates for fixed 30-year
U.S.  loans  dropped for the first time in four weeks, matching a
record low, as housing demand remains depressed.  Rates for 30-year mortgages fell to 4.32 percent in the
week ended today from 4.37 percent, Freddie Mac said in a
statement. The average 15-year  rate  was 3.75 percent, according
to the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage finance company.  This week’s 30-year rate matched the record reached four
weeks ago that was the lowest in Freddie Mac data dating to
1971. Low borrowing costs have done little to bring homebuyers
back to the market as  unemployment  hovers near 10 percent.  “There’s a problem with confidence because the
unemployment rate remains very high,” said  Donald Rissmiller ,
chief economist at Strategas Research Partners in New York. “We
have a housing market struggling to stay flat at very depressed
levels.”  Home  prices  in 20 U.S. cities rose at a slower pace in July
from a year earlier as the end of a federal tax credit hurt
sales, the S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values showed this
week. A high number of foreclosures also is reducing demand for
homes. Banks seized a record 95,364 homes from delinquent
borrowers in August, according to RealtyTrac Inc.  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s loan  application  index
fell 0.8 percent in the week ended Sept. 24 to the lowest level
in almost two months. Purchase  applications  increased 2.4
percent, while  refinancing  declined 1.6 percent, the Washington-
based group said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
