European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said that the ECB will continue
buying government bonds as long as there are inefficiencies in
the markets, Wirtschaftswoche reported, citing an interview.   “Markets are exaggerating the risk premiums” for
government bonds for countries including Ireland and Portugal,
Nowotny was cited as saying. “As long as these inefficiencies
prevail, we will correct them.”     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
