(Corrects size of gain in second paragraph.)  Kuwait  stocks  rose to the highest
in four months as Zain, the country’s largest mobile-phone
company, got a purchase offer for a 46 percent stake, boosting
investor sentiment. Emaar Properties PJSC fell in Dubai.  Gulf Cable and Electrical Industries Co.,  the Kuwaiti maker
of electrical equipment, soared to the highest in a year and
 Kuwait Food Co.  jumped 6.3 percent. Zain shares were suspended
from trading pending clarification on the offer from Abu Dhabi-
based  Emirates Telecommunications Corp.  The  Kuwait SE Price
Index  increased 0.8 percent to 6,985, the highest since May 24,
at the close in Kuwait City. The index rose 6.8 percent in the
past three months, its biggest quarterly gain since the one
ended March.  The gains are a “spillover from Zain’s news,” said  Jasem Al Zeraei , head of institutional sales at NBK Capital in Kuwait.  Etisalat, the largest telecommunications company in the
Middle East by market value, today said it offered 1,700 fils a
share for 46 percent of Zain. The company yesterday said it made
a “conditional offer” for the stake. Zain shares surged 8
percent yesterday to 1,360 fils. Etisalat dropped 0.5 percent to
10.75 dirhams at 1:46 p.m. in Abu Dhabi.  Gulf Cable rose to 1,980 fils, the highest since September
2009. Kuwait Foods, the food-processing company and restaurant
operator known as Americana, soared to 1,680 fils, the highest
since March 14.  Dubai’s  benchmark index  fell 0.9 percent, trimming the gain
for the quarter to 15 percent.  Emaar,  developer of the world’s
tallest tower, lost 1.6 percent to 3.74 dirhams after it raised
$450 million from the sale of convertible notes.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  retreated 0.1 percent, Oman’s
 MSM30 Index  and  Qatar’s  gauge slipped 0.3 percent. Bahrain’s
 measure  rose less than 0.1 percent. Saudi Arabia’s market was
closed for the weekend.  To contact the reporters on this story:
