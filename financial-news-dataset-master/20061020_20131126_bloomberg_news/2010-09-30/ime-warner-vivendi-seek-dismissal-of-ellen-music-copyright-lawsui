Vivendi SA ’s music labels and Time
Warner Inc. ended a lawsuit that alleged Time Warner played the
labels’ songs without permission while producing  Ellen DeGeneres’s  television talk show.  The companies filed a joint notice yesterday in federal
court in Los Angeles to end the copyright infringement case,
which was filed in March. The online docket for the case states
it was “terminated” yesterday. No reason was given.  Interscope Records, Motown Record Co. and UMG Recordings
said in the suit that the “Ellen DeGeneres Show” played
hundreds of their recordings without obtaining permission or
paying for licenses. The songs included “Superfreak” by  Rick James  and “My Humps” by the Black Eyed Peas, according to the
labels, part of Paris-based Vivendi’s Universal Music Group, the
world’s largest record company.  The producers, including New York-based  Time Warner’s 
Warner Bros. Television, said they had an “implied” license
because the labels took no action for almost six years. The
defendants also said the labels benefited when their artists
appeared on the show.  Jeffrey Goldman , a lawyer for Interscope, didn’t return
messages for comment.  Scott Rowe , a spokesman for Warner Bros.
Television, said the company declined to comment.  U.S. District Judge  Stephen Wilson  on Aug. 30 denied a
request by both sides to halt the case for arbitration and said
it would proceed to trial on Nov. 30.  The case is Interscope Records v. Time Warner Inc., 10-
1662, U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los
Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
