Polish companies’ and households’
expectations of annual inflation in 12 months fell to 2.1
percent in September from 2.7 percent in August, according to a
survey published today on the website of the Warsaw-based
Narodowy Bank Polski.  The reading matched July’s survey result, which was the
lowest since October 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
