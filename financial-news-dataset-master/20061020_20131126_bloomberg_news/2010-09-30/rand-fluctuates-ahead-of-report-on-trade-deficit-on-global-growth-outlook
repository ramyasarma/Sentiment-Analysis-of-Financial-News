The rand weakened against the
dollar after South Africa posted its biggest trade deficit in
six months, boosting the currency’s reliance on foreign capital
inflows. Bonds slumped after producer inflation quickened.  South Africa’s currency declined as much as 0.3 percent to
6.9940 per dollar and traded 0.2 percent weaker at 6.9877 by
2:11 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of 6.9731.  The country’s  trade shortfall  was 4.7 billion rand ($675
million) in August, compared with a surplus of 2 billion rand in
July, the  South African Revenue Service  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The median estimate of 12 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was for a deficit of 800 million rand.  “Exports dropped a lot more than expected,” said  Carmen Nel , a Cape Town-based economist at Rand Merchant Bank. “If
that trend continues we could see a sharper than anticipated
widening in the current account deficit, which would put the
rand under pressure over time.”  South Africa relies on foreign purchases of its stocks and
bonds to fund the shortfall on its  current account , a measure of
goods and services trade, which eased to a six-year low of 2.5
percent of gross domestic product in the second quarter. Foreign
investors have purchased a net 81.5 billion rand of South
African bonds and 20.8 billion rand of stocks this year,
according to data from the JSE Ltd., which runs the exchanges.  Bonds Fall  The inflows have helped the rand extend its surge against
the dollar since the start of last year to 35 percent. The
currency has gained 5.7 percent in the past month and 9.6
percent in the last quarter.  Government bonds fell the most in more than two-months
after a report showed producer price inflation accelerated more
than estimated last month. South Africa’s benchmark 13.5 percent
security due September 2015 dropped 43 cents to 125.42 rand, the
steepest slide since Sept. 16. The move increased the yield by 9
basis points to 7.29 percent.  Producer price inflation  quickened to an annual 7.8 percent
in August, from 7.7 percent in July, Pretoria-based Statistics
South Africa said on its website today. The  median estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey was for a reading of 7.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
