South African Airways, the biggest
airline in Africa, is in talks with Ethiopian Airlines and Egypt
Air about starting a new carrier on the continent, Sake24
reported, citing SAA Chief Executive  Siza Mzimela .  The state-owned company is expected to announce the new
airline “within months,” the Johannesburg-based news agency
said. The airline will operate in central and West Africa,
according to  Sake24 .  SAA, Egypt Air and Ethiopian Airlines will all likely own
minority stakes in the new venture and provide technical and
managerial services, the news agency reported.  Central African countries in which the new airline is
likely to operate include Gabon, Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, São Tomé & Principe and the Central African
Republic, Sake24 said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
