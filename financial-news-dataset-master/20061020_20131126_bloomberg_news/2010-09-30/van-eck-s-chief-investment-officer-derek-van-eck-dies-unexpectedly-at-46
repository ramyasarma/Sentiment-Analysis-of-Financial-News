Derek van Eck , a principal and
chief investment officer at mutual-fund firm Van Eck Associates
Corp., died unexpectedly last night. He was 46, and the cause of
death wasn’t disclosed.  Van Eck managed the $3.3 billion  Van Eck Global Hard Assets
Fund , the New York-based firm said today in a statement. He will
be succeeded by  Shawn Reynolds  and Charles Cameron as co-
managers. Van Eck had a “health condition” that was
“neurological in nature,” according to an Aug. 17 note on a
 cached page  on the company’s website.  Reynolds, who joined Van Eck in 2005, heads the company’s
energy-investment group. Cameron, who has been with Van Eck for
more than 15 years, is the firm’s director of trading.  The company, which was founded in 1955 by  John van Eck ,
Derek’s father, managed $20 billion as of Dec. 31, according to
its website. Derek van Eck joined in 1993. Chris Sullivan, a
spokesman for the firm, declined to comment. Derek’s brother
Jan, Reynolds and Cameron didn’t return messages.  Van Eck graduated from Williams College with a Bachelor in
Economics in 1986, and earned a Master of Business
Administration at the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management
at Northwestern University in 1993. He is survived by his wife,
Deborah, and his children, Willem and Kathryn, according to the
statement. He lived in New York City and Sharon, Connecticut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
