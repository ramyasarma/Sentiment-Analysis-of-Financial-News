Mexico’s drug-related violence
poses a “clear threat” to the economy and is likely hurting
the country’s currency, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a  report .  The surge in violence, driven by drug cartels fighting for
control of trafficking routes to the U.S., is boosting costs for
businesses and curbing gross fixed investment, economist  Alonso Cervera  said in the report e-mailed today.  “Mexico’s escalating crime problems have effectively
become a clear threat to the strength of the recovery,” Cervera
wrote in the report. “The peso would probably be stronger if
the country was safer,” he added.  At least 28,000 people have been killed during President
 Felipe Calderon ’s administration in violence tied to organized
crime. The number of deaths related to criminal groups totaled
about 4,250 in the second quarter, an 85 percent increase from
the same period a year earlier, according to figures from a
government report released in July.  Gangs are also targeting political candidates and public
officials. Gustavo Sanchez, the interim mayor of Tancitaro in
Michoacan state, was killed Sept. 27, becoming the 11th city
chief killed in Mexico in 2010. The mayor-elect of Gran Morelos,
Chihuahua, was shot and injured as he worked at his veterinary
office on Sept. 24, and the mayor of the town of Doctor Gonzalez
in Nuevo Leon state was killed Sept. 23.  Mexico’s gross domestic product grew 5.1 percent in July
from a year earlier, the national statistics agency said. The
economy contracted 6.5 percent last year, the most since 1932,
amid the global financial crisis.  The peso will remain within the 12.40-to-13.30 range
against the dollar this year, according to the report. The peso
fell 0.5 percent to 12.5995 per dollar at 2:36 p.m. New York
time, from 12.5390 yesterday.  Gross fixed investment grew 0.6 percent in June from a year
earlier, lower than the 4.3 percent estimate by 10 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
