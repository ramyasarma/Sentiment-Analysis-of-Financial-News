The National Basketball
Association fined Washington Wizards owner  Ted Leonsis 
$100,000 for speaking without permission about talks
surrounding a new collective bargaining agreement.  Leonsis, 53, told a group of businessmen in northern
Virginia yesterday that he favored a hard salary cap,
similar to the one used by the National Hockey League, and
that it may be introduced in the future in the NBA.
Basketball teams now may exceed the league salary cap if
they are willing to pay a luxury tax.  The league and players’ union are negotiating on a new
collective bargaining agreement to take effect next summer.  “In a salary cap era -- and soon a hard salary cap in
the NBA like it’s in the NHL -- if everyone can pay the
same amount to the same amount of players, it’s the small
nuanced differences that matter,” Leonsis, who also owns
the Washington Capitals of the NHL, said according to the
Associated Press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
