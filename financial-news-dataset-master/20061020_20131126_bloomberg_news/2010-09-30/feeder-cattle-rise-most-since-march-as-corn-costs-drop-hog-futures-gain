Feeder-cattle futures rose the most
since March as plunging corn prices reduced the cost of raising
the animals for slaughter. Hogs and cattle sold to meatpackers
also gained.  Corn futures in Chicago fell as much as 5.3 percent to a
two-week low after the government said U.S. inventories before
the harvest were at the highest level in four years. Cheaper
grain may encourage feedlots to buy more animals and fatten them
longer. Feedlots boosted purchases by 7.1 percent last month as
higher prices for animals improved prospects for profit.  “At the feedlot level, if you spend less on corn, then
that same guy can pay more for feeders,” said  Adam Stout , a
risk-management consultant with FCStone Group Inc. in Kansas
City, Missouri.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement rose 2.225
cents, or 2 percent, to settle at $1.12025 a pound at 1:05 p.m.
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the biggest gain for a most-
active contract since March 18. The price has climbed 16 percent
in 2010.  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened mostly on corn until they weigh about 1,200 pounds,
when they are sold to meatpackers.  Live-cattle futures for December delivery rose 1.025 cent,
or 1 percent, to settle at 99.6 cents a pound. The commodity has
gained 16 percent this year.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 1.025 cent, or 1.4
percent, to close at 74.875 cents a pound. Earlier, the price
touched 73.4 cents, the lowest level since Aug. 11.  Yesterday, hogs declined 2.7 percent, the biggest drop
since Aug. 5. The price has climbed 14 percent this year.  “Hogs were oversold yesterday,” said  Parker McMahan , a
senior account executive at Price Futures Group in Chicago.
