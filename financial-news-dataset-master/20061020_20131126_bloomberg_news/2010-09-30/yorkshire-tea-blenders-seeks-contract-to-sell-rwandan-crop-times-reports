Yorkshire Tea Blenders Ltd. is
seeking a contract with the Rwandan Tea Authority to sell the
East African country’s crop abroad, the  New Times  reported,
citing Anthony Butera, director-general of the industry body.  The authority had a meeting with Yorkshire representatives
last month, the Kigali-based newspaper reported. The terms of a
deal are yet to be agreed, it said.  Rwanda  earned $28.3 million from tea exports last year, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
