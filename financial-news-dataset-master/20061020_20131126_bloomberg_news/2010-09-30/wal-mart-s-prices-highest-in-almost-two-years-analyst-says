Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ’s prices rose
in September to the highest level in at least 21 months,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., as the world’s largest
retailer scaled back discounts from earlier this year.  The cost of a 31-item basket of goods at a Wal-Mart in
Virginia was $95.75, a 2.7 percent increase from August and a 5
percent gain from the start of 2010, analyst  Charles Grom  said
today in a report. The price is the most since the New York-
based analyst began the survey in January 2009.  Prices for produce climbed as Wal-Mart offered almost no
discounts on food last month, Grom said. Price cuts on items
such as cereal and ketchup failed to attract as many consumers
as Wal-Mart anticipated, dragging down sales in the  latest
quarter , U.S. stores chief  William Simon  said last month.  Produce accounted for 7 of the 31 items in the basket, with
prices 10 percent higher in September than the previous month.
Prices for dairy products rose 2 percent, and meat was
unchanged.  Wal-Mart  rose 17 cents to $53.52 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are little changed
this year.  Wal-Mart’s prices came in below a similar basket of goods
bought at stores operated by  Kroger Co . and  Safeway Inc.  The gap
between Wal-Mart and the traditional grocers narrowed in
September, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
