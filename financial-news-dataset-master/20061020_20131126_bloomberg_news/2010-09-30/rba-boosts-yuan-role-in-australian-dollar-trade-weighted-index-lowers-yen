The Reserve Bank of Australia
increased the significance of the Chinese yuan in its trade-
weighted index for the Australian dollar.  The yuan will account for 22.54 percent of the gauge as of
tomorrow, from 18.56 percent, the Sydney-based RBA said today on
its website. The Japanese yen’s weighting will decline to 14.94
percent from 17.12 percent, while the euro will fall to 9.92
percent from 10.44 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
