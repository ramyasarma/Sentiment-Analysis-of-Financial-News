Investors should sell the euro
against the dollar, betting the single currency will decline to
$1.2650, because speculation the Federal Reserve will increase
asset purchases pushed the U.S. currency too low, Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said.  “The fear of quantitative easing is now approaching
excessive levels,”  Lee Hardman , a strategist in London, wrote
in a research note today. “We recommend taking advantage of
excessive dollar pessimism to position for the euro’s renewed
descent.”  The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3663 as of 11:10 a.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
