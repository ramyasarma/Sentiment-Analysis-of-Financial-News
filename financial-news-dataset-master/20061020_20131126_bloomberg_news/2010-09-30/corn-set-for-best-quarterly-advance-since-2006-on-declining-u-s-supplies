Corn climbed for a second day in
Chicago, heading for the biggest quarterly gain in almost four
years, on speculation rising demand for ethanol and animal feed
will crimp stocks in the U.S.  December-delivery corn added 0.1 percent to $5.0575 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 12:57 p.m. Paris time.
The most-active contract’s quarterly advance of 35 percent is
the biggest since the three months through December 2006.  U.S. stockpiles probably fell to 1.41 billion bushels on
Sept. 1 from 4.31 billion bushels three months ago and 1.67
billion bushels a year ago, according to an average estimate of
19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture will release estimates on stockpiles of corn, wheat
and soybeans at 8:30 a.m. in Washington today.  “I think it’s a result of uncertainty over the U.S.
crop,”  Michael Pitts , commodity sales director at National
Australia Bank Ltd., said by phone from Sydney today of the
quarterly advance. Declining yields in the U.S., the largest
grower and exporter, added to concerns that supply is falling as
demand expands, he said.  Rising ethanol demand is pushing corn stockpiles lower,
according to a Sept. 28 e-mail from Allendale Inc., which
estimated inventories may have fallen to 1.405 billion bushels.  Ethanol Production  U.S. ethanol makers will produce 12.8 billion gallons of
the fuel this year, based on an estimate by the Renewable Fuels
Association, a lobby co-founded by Archer Daniels Midland Co.,
the world’s largest grain processor. Ethanol can be made from
crops including corn and sugar cane.  Wheat for December delivery slipped 0.2 percent to $6.8225
a bushel, taking the contract’s quarterly advance to 42 percent.
That would be the best performance for the most-active contract
in three years.  U.S. exporters sold 110,000 metric tons of soft, white
wheat to Egypt for delivery in the year that started June 1, the
USDA said yesterday. That adds to 722,600 tons of outstanding
U.S. wheat sales to Egypt and accumulated exports of 626,400
tons as of Sept. 16 in the year that began June 1.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris added 0.8 percent to 210.50 euros ($287.48) a ton.  Soybeans for November delivery gained 0.8 percent to
$11.075 a bushel in Chicago. The oilseed is up 23 percent for
the quarter, the biggest increase for the most-active contract
since the three months through June 2008.  U.S. exporters sold 165,000 tons of soybeans to China for
delivery in the year that began Sept. 1, the USDA said
yesterday. That added to 11.118 million tons in outstanding U.S.
sales to China for delivery this marketing year and accumulated
exports to the Asian nation of 231,300 tons as of Sept. 16,
according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
