European stocks erased their drop
as reports showed U.S. initial jobless-benefit claims declined
last week and second-quarter growth was revised higher.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.1 percent to 261.29 at
1:35 p.m. in London, having earlier declined as much as 0.6
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
