Limitless LLC, a real-estate
developer controlled by state-owned Dubai World, received a six-
month extension on a $1.2 billion syndicated loan maturing
today, according to three bankers familiar with the deal.  The loan has been extended on the same terms and was
originally scheduled to be repaid in March, the bankers said,
declining to be identified because the information is private.
Discussions on restructuring the loan continue, they said.  A spokeswoman for Limitless declined to comment as did a
spokesman for Dubai World.  Dubai World, one of the emirate’s three main government
holding companies, said on Sept. 10 that creditors holding more
than 99 percent of the value of its loans approved a plan to
alter the terms on $24.9 billion of debt. The deepest financial
crisis since the 1930s sparked a drop of more than 50 percent in
property prices in Dubai and froze credit markets. That
prevented some of the emirate’s state-owned companies from
raising new loans.  Limitless raised the Islamic loan in dollars and United
Arab Emirates dirhams in 2008 from a group of 18 banks,
according to a company statement at that time. Emirates NBD
PJSC, Arab National Bank and National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC
helped Limitless raise the loan, while Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, RHB Investment Bank Bhd. and United Bank Ltd. were
among lenders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
