Sanofi-Aventis SA  said the
experimental diabetes drug lixisenatide combined with its best-
seller Lantus helped patients better control the level of sugar
in their blood.  The study of 311 patients in Asia with the most common form
of diabetes, known as Type 2, showed those who struggled to keep
blood sugar in check with basal insulin alone were helped by the
addition of a daily lixisenatide injection, Paris-based Sanofi
said in a statement. As many as 60 percent of the patients took
Lantus as their basal insulin.  Diabetes occurs when the body doesn’t produce or properly
use insulin, a hormone needed to convert sugar, starches and
other food into the energy needed for daily life. Lixisenatide
belongs to a class of drugs that imitate a hormone called GLP-1
to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin after meals.  Sanofi trails Novo Nordisk A/S and Eli Lilly & Co. in
developing a GLP-1 product. By the time the medicine is
approved, its main value will be in a combination with Lantus,
analysts at Bryan, Garnier & Co. wrote in a report Sept. 21.  The study’s goal was to “establish the efficacy and safety
of using both drugs together,” said David Solomon, chief
executive officer of Zealand Pharma A/S, the Danish company that
developed lixisenatide from the spit of the Gila monster. “This
shows you get very good control of your diabetes and that it’s a
very safe approach.”  Sanofi fell 59 cents, or 1.2 percent, to 48.88 euros at
5:35 p.m. in Paris trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
