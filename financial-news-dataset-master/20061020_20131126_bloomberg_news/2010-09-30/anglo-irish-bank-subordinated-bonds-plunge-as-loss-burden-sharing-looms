Anglo Irish Bank Corp.  subordinated
bonds plunged after the government said it’s working on ways of
sharing the lender’s losses with holders of junior notes.  The bank’s 500 million euros ($680 million) of subordinated
floating-rate bonds due 2016 fell as much as 6.5 cents to 19
cents on the euro and were at 21.5 cents as of 11 a.m. in
London, according to Jefferies International Ltd. The
nationalized lender has 2.45 billion euros of subordinated debt
outstanding after buying back securities last year at an average
price of 32 cents on the euro.  The Irish government  today pledged  more than 34 billion
euros to support Anglo Irish which was nationalized when bad
loans soared following the collapse of a decade-long real-estate
bubble. Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  said the bank’s senior
debt will be honored while there will be “burden sharing” for
junior noteholders.  “People were expecting a tender for junior debt,” said
 Tom Jenkins , an analyst at Jefferies. “It looks like we’ll see
a stick and carrot approach, the carrot being the discounted
tender, the stick being that if you don’t take part then you
face owning something worth zero.”  The cost of credit-default swaps insuring 10 million euros
of Anglo Irish subordinated debt for five years rose to 4.68
million euros in advance and 500,000 euros annually, from 4.35
million euros upfront, according to data provider CMA.  Swaps on Anglo Irish senior debt fell 61.5 basis points to
820, CMA said, the lowest in three weeks.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
