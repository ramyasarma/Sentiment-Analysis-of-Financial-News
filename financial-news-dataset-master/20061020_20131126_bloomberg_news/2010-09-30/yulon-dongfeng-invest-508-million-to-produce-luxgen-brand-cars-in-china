Yulon Motor Co.  and China’s
 Dongfeng Motor Corp.  signed an agreement to jointly invest in a
3.4 billion yuan ($508.2 million) venture in the eastern Chinese
city of Hangzhou to produce Taiwan-based Yulon’s Luxgen brand
cars.  The venture, which will make Luxgen passenger cars and
electric vehicles, has annual capacity of 120,000 in the first
stage, Yulon said in an e-mailed statement.  Automakers including Yulon are expanding in China, where

biggest auto market.  Dongfeng Yulon Motor Co., equally owned by the two
investors, will have an initial capital of 1.55 billion yuan.
The venture will start mass production from mid-2011, the
companies said.  Shares of  Yulon Motor  fell 0.4 percent to NT$56.7 as of

Automobile Co. ’s shares rose 1.5 percent to 5.51 yuan, while
Hong Kong-listed  Dongfeng Motor Group Co.  gained 1.9 percent to
HK$15.82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
