Copper may drop as investors judge
that a rise to the highest level in more than two years in
London leaves prices no longer reflecting the outlook for
demand, a survey showed.  Eight of 15 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 53 percent, said the metal will fall next week.
Seven predicted higher prices. Copper for delivery in three
months was up 0.8 percent for this week at $8,012.25 a metric
ton at 4 p.m. yesterday on the London Metal Exchange. The
contract posted the highest quarterly increase in a year
yesterday, taking this year’s gains to 9 percent. It reached
$8,075 a ton on Sept. 29, the highest since Aug. 1, 2008.  “These metals commodities are way overdone on the
upside,” said  Donald Selkin , chief market strategist at
National Securities Corp. in New York.  Copper’s 14-day relative strength index this week rose
above 70, a signal to some analysts and traders who study
technical charts that prices may be set to decline.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of Sept. 24.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
51 of the past 105 weeks, or 49 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 7  Bearish : 8  To contact the reporter on the story:
