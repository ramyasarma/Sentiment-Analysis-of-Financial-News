Johnson & Johnson , the maker of
Acuvue brand contact lenses, won a U.K. appeals court ruling
affirming that competitor  Novartis AG ’s European patent for
extended-wear lenses is invalid.  The judgment against Novartis and its Ciba Vision unit was
handed down today at the Court of Appeal in London. Novartis,
Switzerland’s largest drugmaker, appealed after a lower court in
July 2009 ruled its patent was “insufficient.”  The lower court “was entirely right to decide the patent
was insufficient,” U.K. Court of Appeal Justice Robin Jacob
wrote in the ruling. The patent is “nothing but a hazard to
those conducting research into extended-wear contact lenses.”  Novartis, based in Basel, Switzerland, sued in May 2007
over claims that J&J’s  Acuvue Oasys  lenses violate the patent by
using similar chemicals. J&J, the world’s biggest health-
products company, began selling Oasys in February 2005 through
its Vision Care unit. Lawsuits over the same lenses have also
been filed in the U.S.  Novartis argued that the lower court’s judgment was “out
on a limb” because Dutch and French courts had considered the
same patent and arrived at different conclusions. A three-judge
panel at the appeals court today disagreed.  “Johnson & Johnson Vision Care is very pleased” that the
court ruled that the patent “is completely invalid” in the
U.K., spokesman Gary Esterow said in an interview.  J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, argued in the U.K.
appeal that Novartis’s patent covered too much technology.  An e-mail to Ciba Vision’s U.K. press office wasn’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
