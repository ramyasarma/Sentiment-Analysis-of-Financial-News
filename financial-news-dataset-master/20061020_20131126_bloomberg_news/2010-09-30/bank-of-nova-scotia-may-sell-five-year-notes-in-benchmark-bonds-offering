Bank of Nova Scotia  plans to sell
$1.25 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated five-year notes as soon
as today, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The debt from the Canadian lender may yield 83 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, said the person, who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t set. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
