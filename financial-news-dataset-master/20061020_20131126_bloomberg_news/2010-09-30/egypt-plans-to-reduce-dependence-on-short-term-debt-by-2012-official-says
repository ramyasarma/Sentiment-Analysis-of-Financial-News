Egypt’s Ministry of Finance plans
to reduce its dependence on short-term borrowing by 10 percent
in the next two years as it seeks to lower its refinancing risk,
a senior ministry official said.  Sixty percent of tradable outstanding government debt is in
local currency treasury bills, with a maturity of as much as one
year, Mohamed Assaad, head of the public debt unit at the
Ministry of Finance, said in an interview in Cairo today. The
North African country aims to raise the average maturity of its
outstanding debt to 3.5 years by 2012 from the current 2.1
years, Assaad said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
