The Australian dollar is likely to
rise above parity to the U.S. currency next year, Australian &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said today in a note to clients.  The so-called Aussie may slide this year from its current
levels near 98.50 U.S. cents, the strongest since the currency
started trading freely in 1983, ANZ said. Investors may benefit
from selling the Australian dollar near 98.50 cents and then
buying it should the currency drop to between 92 and 93 cents,
the bank said.  The Australian currency bought 96.73 cents as of 1:57 p.m.
in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
