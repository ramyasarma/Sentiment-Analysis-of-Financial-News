Viacom Inc. , the owner of MTV
Networks and the Paramount Pictures film studio, named its
controller  James W. Barge  as  chief financial officer .  Barge, previously executive vice president, controller, tax
and treasury, succeeds  Thomas Dooley , who was promoted to chief
operating officer in May, New York-based Viacom said today in a
statement. Barge, 55, will continue to report to Dooley.  Viacom created the post of operating chief this year to
establish Dooley, who had been CFO since 2007, as the second-in-
command behind Chief Executive Officer  Philippe Dauman . The
company also extended Dooley’s contract by five years to
December 2016. Barge will take over as finance chief tomorrow,
the company said.  Barge joined Viacom, which airs the hit show “Jersey
Shore” on MTV, in January 2008 after 13 years in financial
roles with media company  Time Warner Inc.  Prior to that, he
worked for public accounting firm Ernst & Young.  Viacom, also the owner of Nickelodeon and VH1,  rose  42
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $36.70 at 10:44 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Before today, the shares had  gained 
22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
