Societe Generale SA  won dismissal
of a U.S. investor lawsuit over  Jerome Kerviel ’s 4.9 billion-
euro ($6.7 billion) trading loss and a 1.1 billion-euro write
down related to the subprime mortgage market.  A  U.S. Supreme Court  ruling from June that limits the
rights of investors who bought shares in foreign companies on
foreign exchanges to sue in American courts extends to U.S.
investors, U.S. District Judge  Richard Berman  in New York said
in a ruling yesterday.  The Supreme Court decision “compels dismissal of all three
plaintiffs,” Berman wrote. “As here, domestic plaintiffs
purchased shares of a foreign bank traded on a foreign
exchange,” Berman said, making arguments the Supreme Court
decision applied only to foreign investors “inapplicable.”  A Paris court rules next week on whether Kerviel is
criminally responsible for the January 2008 trading loss, which
occurred when France’s second-largest bank unwound 50 billion
euros in unauthorized bets. French engineering group  Alstom SA 
on Sept. 13 also won dismissal of a U.S. lawsuit filed by
investors who bought shares on foreign exchanges, based on the
Supreme Court ruling.  The case is 1:08-cv-02495-RMB, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
