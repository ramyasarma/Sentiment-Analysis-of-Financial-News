Sydney Airport, Australia’s biggest
airport, said banks have offered it more than A$1 billion ($965
million) in loans to refinance debt maturing in 2011 and 2012.  The commitments from new and existing lenders include loans
with terms between three years and seven years, which carry
margins of between 200 basis points and 250 basis points over
the bank bill swap rate, the airport’s majority owner  MAp Group 
said in a regulatory filing today. The total amount exceeds
Sydney Airport’s term debt maturing in 2011 and 2012, and
financial close is expected by the end of October, according to
the statement.  MAp Group and its subsidiaries have about A$1.35 billion of
bonds and loan facilities maturing over the next two years,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Its unit Sydney Airport
Finance Co. sold $500 million of 10.5-year bonds denominated in
U.S. dollars yesterday, which yield 260 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the data show.  MAp , an Australian-listed company, controls a 74 percent
stake in Sydney Airport, and also owns shares in airports in
Copenhagen and Brussels, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
