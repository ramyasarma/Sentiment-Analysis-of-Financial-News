Japan, the world’s biggest importer
of liquefied natural gas, paid 31 percent more for the fuel in
August from a year earlier as crude oil prices climbed.  Prices for delivered LNG rose to 50,233 yen ($602) a metric
ton in August, according to data from the  Ministry of Finance .
That’s equivalent to about $11.43 per million British thermal
units, more than twice the price of U.S. benchmark gas futures
at Henry Hub, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
