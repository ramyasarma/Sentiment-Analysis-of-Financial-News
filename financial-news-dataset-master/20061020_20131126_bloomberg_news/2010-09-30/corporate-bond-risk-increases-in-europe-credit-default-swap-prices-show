The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 7.75
basis points to 516.75, according to Markit Group Ltd. at 7:15
a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and an increase signals a
deterioration in the perception of credit quality.  The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2 basis points to 112.75, Markit
prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
