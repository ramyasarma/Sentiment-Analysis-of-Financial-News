Rubber in Tokyo climbed to a five-
month high as wet weather in Thailand limited supply. Shanghai
futures declined.  The most-active contract advanced as much as 1.1 percent to
313.2 yen per kilogram ($3,744 a metric ton), the highest level
since April 28, before trading at 311.2 yen on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange at 11:59 a.m. The price is set to rise more
than 15 percent this quarter, the best advance since the three
months ended Dec. 31.  Wet weather disrupted tapping rubber trees in Thailand,
curbing latex production. Shippers in Thailand, the largest
producer and exporter, raised offers for so-called RSS-3 grade
rubber for November shipment to about $3.60 a kilogram from
$3.52 at the end of last week, said  Hisaaki Tasaka , an analyst
at Tokyo-based broker ACE Koeki Co.  “A strong physical market gave support to futures in
Tokyo,” Tasaka said by phone today. “Considering costs for
imports, it’s more economical to buy the contract for physical
delivery in Tokyo.”  The March-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost 0.5 percent to 26,780 yuan ($4,002) a ton at 11:01 a.m.
local time. The market came under pressure as investors were
reducing long, or buy, positions before holidays, Tasaka said.
China’s financial markets will be closed from Oct. 1 to Oct. 7
for National Day holidays.  The price earlier advanced to 26,955 yuan after data showed
yesterday China’s manufacturing quickened in September,
increasing speculation demand will expand from the largest user
of the commodity used in tires.  China Manufacturing  A China purchasing managers’ index  released by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics rose to 52.9, the highest in
five months, from 51.9 in August. The data are seasonally
adjusted and readings above 50 indicate an expansion.  Still, gains in Tokyo rubber futures were limited by
concern that demand from Japan may weaken as a stronger yen
threatens export-oriented manufacturers, Tasaka said.  Japan’s industrial production unexpectedly fell in August,
adding to concerns the nation’s export-led recovery is slowing.
 Factory   output  decreased 0.3 percent from July, when it declined
0.2 percent, the Trade Ministry said in Tokyo today. The median
estimate of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
was for a 1.1 percent gain.  Signs of slowing global demand and the yen’s appreciation
are threatening earnings of companies from  Murata Manufacturing
Co.  to  Nissan Motor Co.  Exports grew at the slowest pace this
year in August and the Bank of Japan’s Tankan survey yesterday
showed companies forecast pessimists will outnumber optimists by
year-end.  The yen traded at 83.55 per dollar at 12:03 a.m. in Tokyo
after climbing yesterday to 83.50, the highest level since Sept.
15, when it touched a 15-year peak of 82.88.  Cash price in Thailand fell 0.2 percent to 109.15 baht
($3.58) per kilogram as investors are concerned over
strengthening yen and local currency, Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand said on its website yesterday.  Limited supply following persistent rainfalls in southern
Thailand remains price supportive, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
