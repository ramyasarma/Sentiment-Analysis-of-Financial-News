South Africa’s second-largest
state-workers’ union said its members accepted an increased
government wage offer, while another said it was likely to
follow, possibly averting another strike.  The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union
today decided to accept the 7.5 percent wage increase and an
800-rand ($115) monthly housing allowance, spokesman Sizwe Pamla
said in a phone interview from Johannesburg. The union will next
month start negotiating 2011’s wage package, Pamla said.  “It was no longer a question of being happy or not
happy,” said Pamla, whose organization represents about 250,000
members. “Are we prepared to actually go on a strike when we
know that in May we’ll be signing a new wage deal? It’s just
time to move on.”  A 20-day strike, suspended on Sept. 6, by thousands of
teachers, nurses and other state workers, disrupted hospitals
and closed schools as they demanded an 8.6 percent wage hike and
a monthly housing allowance of 1,000 rand. The labor action also
strained relations between President  Jacob Zuma ’s administration
and its union allies.  The Independent Labour Caucus, which groups 10 unions
representing about 460,000 government workers, said some of its
affiliates had decided to accept the offer. Others were still
undecided, Chairman Chris Klopper said today in a phone
interview.  When asked if it’s likely that the ILC will approve the
wage offer, Klopper said: “That’s the way it’s looking.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
