U.S. stocks fell as declines in
consumer and technology companies wiped out an early rally
triggered by better-than-estimated economic reports.  Apple Inc. lost 1 percent and was the biggest drag on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Caterpillar Inc., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and International Business Machines Corp. lost at least 0.7
percent for the biggest declines in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 1,143.63 at 11:15 a.m.
in New York after rallying as much as 1.1 percent earlier. The
Dow declined 15.21 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,820.07 after
climbing 114 points earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
