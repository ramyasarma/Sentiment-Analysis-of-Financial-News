France Telecom SA  and  Deutsche
Telekom AG ’s U.K. joint venture Everything Everywhere will cut
about 1,200 jobs following the merger which created Britain’s
largest wireless operator.  The venture will eliminate positions in back-office and
management roles to avoid duplication, it said today in a
statement. About 7.5 percent of the total workforce will be cut
as the company targets more than 3.5 billion pounds ($5.5
billion) in cost savings.  Everything Everywhere was formed after the French and
German phone companies agreed last September to merge their
mobile-phone businesses in the U.K. to create the country’s
largest operator and overtake Telefonica SA’s O2 unit. The
Orange and T-Mobile brands remain separate.  “We need to ensure we are operating with maximum
efficiency, effectively serving our two brands, while removing
any unnecessary duplication from the business,” Chief Executive
Officer  Tom Alexander  said in today’s statement.  The 50-50 venture “will continuously grow” its earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to achieve
an Ebitda margin of more than 25 percent by 2014, the unit said
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
