South African credit growth
accelerated to an annual 3 percent in August as interest rates
at a 30-year low spurred consumer spending.  The growth in  borrowing  by households and businesses rose
from 2 percent in July, the Pretoria-based Reserve Bank said on
its website today. The  median estimate  of 18 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was for a gain of 2.7 percent.  The Reserve Bank has cut its benchmark interest  rate  twice
this year, pushing it to 6 percent, curbing debt repayments and
fueling the recovery in consumer spending. Retailers, such as
 Shoprite Holdings Ltd. , Africa’s biggest grocer, are expanding
in anticipation of stronger spending.  “The consumer recovery is firmly entrenched although it’s
not going to shoot the lights out,” said  Jeffrey Schultz , a
macroeconomic strategist at Absa Group Ltd. in Johannesburg.
“The Reserve Bank will be relatively comfortable” with
interest rates where they are, he said.  Bonds fell for a third day, with the yield on the R157
government bond, due 2015, rising 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 7.24 percent today. The rand was at 6.9698
against the dollar as of 9:31 a.m. in Johannesburg from 6.9762
before the data was released.  The recovery in credit demand hasn’t added to pressure on
 inflation , which eased to an annual 3.5 percent in August from
3.7 percent the month before, the statistics office said
yesterday.  Household expenditure rose an annual 4.8 percent in the
second quarter, after expanding 5.7 percent in the previous
three months, the central bank said on Sept. 22. Cape Town-based
Shoprite said on Aug. 24 that it plans to open 85 stores and add
5,700 jobs this fiscal year.  The broad  M3  measure of money supply increased an annual
4.4 percent in August, from 3.7 percent in July, the central
bank said. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for M3
to expand 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
