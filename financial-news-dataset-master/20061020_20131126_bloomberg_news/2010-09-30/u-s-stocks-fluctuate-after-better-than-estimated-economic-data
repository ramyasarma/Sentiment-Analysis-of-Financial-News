U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses on the last day of the market’s best September since 1939
as improving economic data caused investors to question whether
the Federal Reserve will need to take further measures to
bolster growth.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1 percent to
1,145.52 at 2:50 p.m. in New York after rallying as much as 1.1
percent and declining as much as 0.8 percent. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average lost 12.56 points, or 0.1 percent, to
10,822.72.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
