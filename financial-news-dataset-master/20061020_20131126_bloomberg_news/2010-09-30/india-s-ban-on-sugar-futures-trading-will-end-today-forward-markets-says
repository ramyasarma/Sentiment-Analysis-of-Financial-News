A ban on sugar futures in India
will end today, paving the way for trading to resume as output
rebounds in the second-largest producer of the commodity.  Contracts for delivery in December or January may be the
first to trade,  B.C. Khatua , chairman of the Forward Markets
Commission, the regulator, said in an interview. He didn’t say
when trading would begin on the exchanges.  India’s production is forecast to reach 25.5 million metric
tons in the season starting Oct. 1, the highest in three years,
according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association. The restriction,
imposed in May last year after global and domestic prices surged
because of a shortage, was extended in December until Sept. 30.  “It will take some time but I am sure that people will
start looking at this contract and we could see volumes building
up again,” Sumesh Parasrampuria, director, business development,
at the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd., or MCX, said by
telephone. “The industry is bullish” on sugar futures.  MCX, the nation’s biggest such exchange, will apply to the
regulator tomorrow for its approval to offer a November-delivery
contract if the ban ends today, Parasrampuria said. The bourse
may even launch October futures if contract specifications are
approved quickly, he said.  Raw-sugar futures in New York have jumped 88 percent since
reaching a 13-month low on May 7 on concern that weather will
hurt crops in Brazil, Russia, China and Pakistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
