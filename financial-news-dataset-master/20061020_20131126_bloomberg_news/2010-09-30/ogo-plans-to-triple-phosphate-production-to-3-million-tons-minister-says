Togo  plans to triple production of
phosphates, a mineral used in making fertilizers, to 3 million
metric tons as the sole producer invests in new equipment,
Energy and Mines Minister Noupokou Dammipi said.  Societe Nouvelles des Phosphates, known as SNPT, the state-
owned company that manages the industry, invested 30 billion CFA
francs ($62 million) in mining and excavation materials, Dammipi
said in an e-mailed response to questions Sept. 28. He declined
to say when the target would be met.  Togo, which has an estimated 60 million tons of phosphate
reserves according to the U.S. State Department, has been
reforming the industry in order to boost output. In 2010, the
value of the country’s phosphate exports may decline to 29.4
billion CFA francs, from 40.3 billion francs in 2009, according
to the  International Monetary Fund . It may increase to 35.7
billion francs in 2011, the Washington-based lender said.  The planned changes also include building a factory to
produce phosphoric acids or fertilizers, Dammipi said.  The government “can’t afford alone” to build the plant and
are in talks with potential investors, he said, declining to
give further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
