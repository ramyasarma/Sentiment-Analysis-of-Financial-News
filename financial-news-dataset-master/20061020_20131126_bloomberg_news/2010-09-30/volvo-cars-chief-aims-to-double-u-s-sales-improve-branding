Volvo Cars, bought by Zhejiang
Geely Holding Group Co. from  Ford Motor Co.  last month, aims to
boost its U.S. market share as part of a global push to double
sales to 800,000 vehicles in 10 years, its chief executive
officer said.  The Swedish carmaker sees a recovery in the U.S.
automotive market and plans to sell 100,000 vehicles a year,
doubling its share in the region to at least 1 percent, CEO
 Stefan Jacoby  said in an interview in Paris today. Volvo sold
334,808 cars worldwide last year, a decline of 11 percent from
2008 and 27 percent from a peak of about 460,000 in 2007,
according to the company.  “We don’t have a long-term strategy for the U.S. market,
we must admit this,” Jacoby said. “It is my priority to bring
back the business and I believe we should be able to sell
100,000 vehicles in the U.S. in the future.” Volvo Cars needs
a sharper identity and better design if it is to reposition
itself as an “upscale” brand, Jacoby said.  Jacoby, 52, started at Volvo on Aug. 16, two weeks after
Geely bought the company. Jacoby previously led Volkswagen AG’s
U.S. operations, where he cut costs, designed the first models
for the North American market, added an assembly plant in
Tennessee and moved the headquarters to Virginia from Michigan.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
