European Union carbon-dioxide
allowances declined as U.K. natural gas for summer fell, making
the cleaner-burning fuel more profitable for utilities.  EU allowances for December fell as much as 1.2 percent to
15.46 euros ($21.12) a metric ton and were at 15.55 euros as of
12:08 p.m. on London’s European Climate Exchange.  U.K. gas for delivery in the six months from April dropped
1.6 percent to 48 pence a therm, a second consecutive decline on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange. That’s the equivalent of $7.63
a million British thermal units. A therm is 100,000 Btus.  Lower gas prices may prompt some power generators to switch
to the fuel, which requires about half as many carbon permits as
coal. Carbon permits are on track for a 2 percent gain in the
quarter ended today. They jumped 19 percent in the three months
through June 30, their best quarterly performance since June
2008, on buying by utilities.  The U.K. said today that the volume of power supplied in
the nation fell 3.3 percent in the three months through June,
compared with the previous quarter. Consumption of coal by
generators dropped 2.9 percent, according to statistics from the
Department of Energy and Climate Change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
