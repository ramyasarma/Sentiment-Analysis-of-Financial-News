The New York Jets signed defensive
end  Trevor Pryce , a 14-year veteran who ranks fourth among
active National Football League players with 90 sacks.  Pryce, 35, played under Jets coach  Rex Ryan  in Baltimore
and recorded a career-high 13 sacks in 2008, when Ryan was the
Ravens’ defensive coordinator. Pryce, who spent his first nine
NFL seasons in Denver, was released by the Ravens yesterday.  Ryan said during a press conference that the Jets, who
signed defensive end  Jason Taylor  during the offseason, would
probably use Pryce in pass-rushing situations. Pryce will be on
the team’s active roster for this weekend’s game against the
Buffalo Bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
