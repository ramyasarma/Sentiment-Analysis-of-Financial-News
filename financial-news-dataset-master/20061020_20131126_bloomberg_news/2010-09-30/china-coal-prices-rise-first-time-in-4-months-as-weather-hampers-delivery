Coal prices at Qinhuangdao, a
Chinese benchmark, rose for the first time in four months as bad
weather hampered supplies and power stations replenished
inventories depleted during summer.  The price of power-station coal with an energy value of
5,500 kilocalories per kilogram gained 0.7 percent to between
715 yuan and 725 yuan ($108) a metric ton as of yesterday from
Sept. 15, according to data released by the China Coal Transport
and Distribution Association on its website. The association
didn’t publish prices last week because of national holidays.  China’s power plants typically stockpile coal ahead of
winter and summer to cope with increased demand during the two
seasons. Coal prices rebounded as typhoons and strong winds this
month disrupted supply plans for utilities looking to build up
inventories used up during the warm season, the association said
in a  report  on its website yesterday.  Stockpiles at Qinhuangdao, which ships half of China’s
seaborne coal, fell 4 percent to 7.8 million tons as of Sept. 24
compared with a week earlier, according to data provider
Shanghai Steelhome Information.  Inventories  rose 76 percent
between April 30 and Sept. 17, the data showed.  -- Chua Baizhen . Editors:  Jane Lee ,  Ryan Woo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
