Wheat output in Argentina, South
America’s largest producer of the grain, will rise 51 percent in
the coming harvest as increased rainfall helps the crop develop,
the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said.  Production from the 2010-2011 crop will rise to at least
11.3 million metric tons, from 7.5 million tons a year earlier,
the exchange said today in its weekly crop  report . That’s below
an Aug. 5 forecast from President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner , who said growers would reap 13 million tons.  Crops were damaged last year by the worst drought in at
least 70 years, paring output to the smallest in a century. This
year, rainfall is boosting soil moisture, which helps wheat in
its early growth stages, the exchange said.  “There has been rain in most of the wheat region, mostly
in the dry western parts,” the exchange said in the report.  Argentine farmers have finished planting 4.2 million
hectares (10.4 million acres) of wheat, the report said. Corn
planting, forecast to cover 3 million hectares, is 26 percent
completed, it said.  The bulk of Argentine wheat is harvested in December and
January.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 7.5 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $6.76 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier the price touched $6.51, the lowest level for a
most-active contract since July 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
