Goodman Fielder Ltd.’s  New Zealand
unit is considering a NZ$175 million ($129 million) fixed-rate
bond issue in its first sale in the country in at least five
years.  Australia’s largest baker hired  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Bank of
New Zealand and Craigs Investment Partners Ltd. to help it sell
the senior unsecured notes, the company said in a regulatory
filing today. The funds will be used to refinance debt, the
statement said.  “We derive a major part of our earnings in New Zealand,”
company spokesman  Ian Greenshields  said by phone. “It makes
sense to secure debt in one of our major operating
environments.”  Goodman Fielder, based in Sydney, got about a third of its
revenue from New Zealand in the last financial year, according
to Bloomberg data. It raised $300 million in the U.S. in June
through a sale of 10-year unsecured notes to repay bank debt due
in November, the company said in a stock exchange statement at
the time.  The baker has a further A$920 million ($893 million) in
debt maturing in 2011 and 2012, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Borrowers including Manukau City Council,  Rabobank
Nederland NV ’s New Zealand branch and  Telstra Corp . have sold
NZ$5.4 billion of bonds in New Zealand this year, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
