Gold rose to a record in New York
and London as investors sought protection from financial turmoil
in Europe and a weakening dollar. Silver climbed to a 30-year
high and palladium reached a 2 1/2-year high.  Ireland’s central bank said Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and
Allied Irish Banks Plc may need as much as 14.4 billion euros
($19.6 billion) in extra capital. Moody’s Investors Service
today downgraded Spain. The dollar dropped to a five-month low
against the euro and has slumped this month on bets the Federal
Reserve will ease monetary policy further to bolster the slowing
U.S. economy.  “The market is still very concerned about developments in
the U.S. and Europe,” said  Bernard Sin , head of currency and
metal trading at bullion refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva.
“People are thinking that gold is one of the only assets to
protect their wealth.”  Gold futures for December delivery added as much $5.90, or
0.5 percent, to $1,316.20 an ounce and traded at $1,313.90 at
8:01 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices are up 5.5 percent
this quarter. Bullion for immediate delivery in London was 0.2
percent higher at $1,312.75 an ounce after reaching $1,315.03.  Bullion rose to a record $1,311 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,307.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Spot
prices are heading for an eighth quarterly gain, the longest
winning streak since 1979. The metal, which usually moves
inversely to the dollar, may reach $1,350 by the end of the
year, Sin said.  Money-Printing Concern  Gold, up 20 percent this year, is heading for its 10th
consecutive annual gain, the longest winning streak since at
least 1920 in London. Bullion has outperformed global equities,
Treasuries and most industrial metals, prompting record
investment in gold-backed exchange-traded products. The metal
rallied as central banks and governments maintained low
borrowing costs and spent trillions of dollars to stimulate
their economies.  The Fed has left its benchmark interest-rate target at a
record low and pledged to take more steps to spur growth if
necessary. Fed policy makers next meet on Nov. 2-Nov. 3.  “The worry is that any additional measures by the Fed will
result in increased printing of money and thus monetization of
some debt,”  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global Ltd. in
Chicago, said in a report. “A decision to add to quantitative
easing will boost gold and silver” on concern that the dollar
will weaken, he said.  Gold assets in ETPs gained 0.67 metric ton to 2,096.42 tons
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10
providers. Holdings are up 17 percent this year and equal the
combined official reserves of China and Switzerland, based on
figures from the World Gold Council.  Iran Currencies Offer  Iran’s  central bank  will offer buyers unlimited amounts of
foreign currencies and gold starting today, as the prices of the
currencies and metal rise, the state-run  Mehr  news agency
reported yesterday, citing Vice President  Mohammad Reza Rahimi .  Prices have gained this year even as U.S. inflation slowed.
Bullion is traditionally bought as a hedge against rising
consumer prices. Inflation expectations, based on the  10-year 
U.S. Treasury breakeven rate, have fallen to 1.8 percent from
2.22 percent six months ago.  Silver for December delivery in New York climbed as much as
0.8 percent to $22.125, the highest price since October 1980,
and was last at $22.02 an ounce. Prices are up 31 percent this
year and 18 percent this quarter, heading for the best quarterly
gain since the three-months ended Sept. 30 last year.  ‘Very Bullish’  The metal, used to create the first telegraph messages, is
heading for a seventh quarterly advance in London. That’s the
best streak since 1974. Prices reached an all-time high of
$50.35 an ounce in New York in 1980, a year after the Hunt
brothers tried to corner the market. The ratio of gold to silver
dropped to as low as 59.5124, the lowest level since October.  Silver futures are set for the second-highest quarterly
close since at least 1975, which is “very bullish
technically,” said  Mark O’Byrne , executive director of
brokerage GoldCore Ltd. in Dublin. “A lot of technically minded
traders will look at that, and now look at the next
psychological level of $25.”  Holdings of silver in ETPs were 13,735.64 tons yesterday,
the most in at least seven months, data compiled by Bloomberg
from four providers show.  “Investors are clearly shifting their focus to precious
metals of a hybrid character,” Commerzbank AG analysts
including  Eugen Weinberg  said today in a report. “These firstly
have the status of a safe haven, but also show some correlation
with the economic cycle. Silver, platinum and also palladium
should therefore remain well supported.”  Platinum for January climbed as much as 0.6 percent to
$1,666 an ounce, the highest level since May 19, and was last at
$1,663. Palladium for December added as much as 1.3 percent to
$574.70, the highest level since March 4, 2008. Prices were last
at $569.80.  To contact the reporter on this story:
