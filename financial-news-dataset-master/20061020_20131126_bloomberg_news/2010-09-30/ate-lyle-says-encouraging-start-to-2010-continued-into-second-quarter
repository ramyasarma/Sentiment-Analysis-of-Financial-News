Tate & Lyle Plc , the maker of low-
calorie sweetener Splenda, said an “encouraging start” to the
year continued in the second quarter.  Tate reported “good operational performance and solid
demand” in a number of its markets. “This underpins our
confidence that we will make progress in the full financial
year,” the London-based company said in a statement today.  Higher corn prices in Europe will have a “modest impact on
profitability on current contracts during the final quarter of
the 2010 calendar year,” according to the company, which
produces ethanol and sweeteners. Tate saw “a benefit” in its
second fiscal quarter from fully hedging corn in the U.S.  Tate & Lyle fell 3.3 pence, or 0.7 percent, to 468.2 pence
at 8:10 a.m. in London trading.  The company completed the sale of its sugar refineries in
the European Union today, exiting the 132-year-old business to
focus on more profitable sectors including its global additives
and ingredients business. The disposal will help the company cut
 net debt,  Tate said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
