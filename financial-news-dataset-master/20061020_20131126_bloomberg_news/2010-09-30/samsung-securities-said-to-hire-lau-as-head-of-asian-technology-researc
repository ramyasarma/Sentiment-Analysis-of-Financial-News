Samsung Securities Co. , South
Korea’s biggest brokerage, appointed  Warren Lau  as head of its
Asian technology research team and plans to hire at least five
other analysts in the region, according to five people with
direct knowledge of the plans.  Lau joined Seoul-based Samsung Securities from Mirae Asset
Securities Co., where he was the Hong Kong-based semiconductor
analyst. Samsung Securities will have about nine technology
analysts in Asia, and plans to open offices in Taiwan and India,
the people said, declining to be identified before an official
announcement.  Lau had previously worked for Macquarie Securities and HSBC
Securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung
Securities said in an e-mailed statement it declined to comment
on the appointment. Calls to Mirae Asset Securities weren’t
answered during the lunch hour.  Samsung Securities, the biggest South Korean brokerage by
cash deposited in accounts, said on Aug. 11 it’s employing more
analysts to boost Hong Kong and China research. The brokerage’s
Hong Kong unit may hire 10 analysts this year to cover
industries including technology and utilities, the company said
at the time.  Samsung Securities  shares  fell 1.7 percent to 64,400 won as
of 12:27 p.m. in Seoul today, while the benchmark  Kospi  stock
index lost 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
