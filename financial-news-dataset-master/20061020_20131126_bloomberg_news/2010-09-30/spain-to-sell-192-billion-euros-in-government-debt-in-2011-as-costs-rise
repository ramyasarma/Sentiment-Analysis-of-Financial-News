Spain will sell 43.3 billion euros
($59 billion) of net debt next year as the government aims to
cut its budget gap by almost half in two years. Bonds rose as
the issuance figure was less than investors expected.  Spain’s Treasury has redemptions of 148.7 billion euros in
2011, making for gross issuance of 192 billion euros, according
to budget documents presented to  parliament  today in Madrid. The
net figure compares with a forecast 76.1 billion euros for 2010.
Most of the new net issuance will come from long-term debt.  Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  presented lawmakers with the
most austere budget in at least three decades, which aims to cut
the shortfall to 6 percent of gross domestic product in 2011
from 11.1 percent last year with spending cuts and a tax
increase on high-earners. The ruling Socialists don’t have a
majority in parliament and will need support from smaller
parties in the mid-October vote.  “It’s less than our expectation,” said  Cagdas Aksu , a
fixed-income analyst at Barclays Capital in London. “It’s an
improvement versus last year, but from a bond-issuance
perspective it will be similar, with the drop in the deficit
being reflected in the bills.”  Investor Premium  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds rather than similar maturity German debt fell to 184 basis
points at 4:30 p.m. in Madrid from 196 basis points yesterday.
Portugal’s risk premium with Germany, more than twice the
Spanish level, was at 398 basis points today after hitting a
euro-era record of 441 basis points on Sept. 28.  Spain’s debt portfolio will see an increase of bonds and
reduction of bills next year, the budget showed. Bonds will
account for 81 percent of outstanding debt. The average maturity
will be 6.7 years.  Interest  costs will amount to 27.4 billion
euros, or 2.53 percent of GDP, compared with a forecast of 23.2
billion euros, or 2.2 percent of GDP, in the 2010 budget.  “The Treasury cut issuance far more than we expected,”
said  Ciaran O’Hagan , a fixed-income strategist at Societe
Generale in Paris.  The government is trying to show it can trim the euro
region’s third-largest budget  gap  without strangling an economy
that’s emerging from an almost two-year recession. The task has
become more urgent as doubts resurface about the finances of
high-deficit euro members such as Portugal and Ireland. Spain’s
credit rating was cut one level to Aa1 today by Moody’s
Investors Service, which cited a weak economic outlook.  Spending Cuts  The budget, approved by the Cabinet on Sept. 24, cuts
spending by around 3 percent compared with this year. Two new
tax brackets will be created for taxpayers earning more than
120,000 euros and 175,000 euros, which the government estimates
will generate 170 million to 200 million euros. For the first
time, a value-added tax increase that came into effect in July
will be in place for a full year, bolstering revenue.  Salgado forecasts the economy will grow 1.3 percent next
year, more than twice the 0.6 percent estimated by the
International Monetary Fund. The government aims to continue
cutting the deficit to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2012 and to 3
percent in 2013, in line with the European Union limit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
