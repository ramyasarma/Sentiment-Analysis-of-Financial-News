Corn prices fell the most in more
than eight months after the U.S., the biggest grower and
exporter, said inventories before the harvest rose to the
highest level since 2006.  Stockpiles  on Sept. 1 totaled 1.708 billion bushels, up 2
percent from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said today in a report. Analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
expected 1.407 billion, on average. Corn usage in the three
months ended Aug. 31 was 2.6 billion bushels, up from 2.59
billion a year earlier.  The inventory number “is a negative surprise, and the
market is adjusting to more of a supply cushion,” said  Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst for Agrivisor LLC in
Bloomington, Illinois. “It’s like adding 2 million acres to
this year’s harvest.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 23.5 cents, or 4.7
percent, to $4.815 a bushel at 10 a.m. on the  Chicago Board of
Trade. A close at that price would be the biggest drop since
Jan. 12. Earlier, the grain touched $4.7825, the lowest level
since Sept. 13.  Before today, corn surged 35 percent since the end of June,
reaching a two-year high on Sept. 27, on speculation that hot,
dry weather in August and flooding in June damaged U.S. crops.
The commodity reached a record $7.9925 on June 27, 2008,  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
