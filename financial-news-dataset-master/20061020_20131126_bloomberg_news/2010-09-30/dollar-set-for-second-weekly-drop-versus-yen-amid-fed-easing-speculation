The dollar fell to the lowest level
since March versus the euro and dropped against the yen after
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York president said more
monetary easing is needed unless the U.S. economy strengthens.  The U.S. currency weakened against 15 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts as the Institute for Supply Management’s factory
index expanded at the slowest pace in 10 months supporting the
Federal Reserve’s forecast of “modest” U.S. growth and leading
investors elsewhere in search of higher yields. The Dollar
Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses to track the
greenback against six major counterparts,  extended  its biggest
monthly drop since June 2009.  “To next Friday, the weaker dollar might be the main
scenario,” said  Hidetoshi Yanagihara , a senior currency trader
at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New York. “Within the ISM
number, the employment factor was much worse than the previous
month, which indicates that next week’s employment number might
be worse. Everybody is now expecting quantitative easing in the
next Federal Open Market Committee meeting.”  The dollar declined 1.1 percent to $1.3779 per euro at 4:11
p.m. in New York, from $1.3634 yesterday. It touched $1.3784,
the weakest level since March 17.  The U.S. currency dropped 0.2 percent to 83.33 yen, from
83.53 yen, after falling to 83.16 yen, the lowest level since
Japan intervened in foreign-exchange markets on Sept. 15. The
euro advanced 0.8 percent to 114.83 yen, from 113.88 yen.  The Dollar Index declined 0.8 percent to 78.089 from
78.720. It fell 5.4 percent in September, the biggest monthly
 decline  since May 2009 when it fell 6.2 percent.  Euro Forecasts  The greenback fell against the euro for the fourth straight
day as 9 out of 45 analysts this week increased their fourth
quarter forecast for the euro against the dollar, according to
Bloomberg data, pushing the median forecast to $1.30, from $1.29
the week before.  “The dollar is being sold on an across-the-board basis as
investors search for yield,” said  Michael Woolfolk , senior
currency strategist in New York at Bank of New York Mellon
Corp., the world’s largest custodial bank, with more than $20
trillion in assets under administration. “With the Fed upping
the ante by saying they’re keeping the door open for
quantitative easing, that has not only introduced an element of
additional risk and uncertainty, but likely pushed off the day
of reckoning for raising interest rates.”  The Australian and New Zealand’s dollars rose as investors
looked for higher interest rates. Benchmark rates are 4.5
percent in Australia and 3 percent in New Zealand. The Fed has
kept its benchmark at a range of zero to 0.25 percent since
December 2008.  Kiwi Levels  The kiwi, as New Zealand’s currency is nicknamed, gained
the most in a month against the greenback. Australia’s currency
is set for a seventh weekly gain against the U.S., its longest
stretch of weekly gains since May 2009, as traders increased
bets the central bank will increase borrowing costs next week.  Australia’s currency strengthened 0.6 percent to 97.31 U.S.
cents from 96.71 cents. It earlier touched 97.51, the strongest
since July 2008.  New Zealand’s dollar climbed 1.4 percent to 74.42 cents
from 73.43 cents. It jumped as much as 1.6 percent.  Brazil’s real rose to a two-year high against the U.S.
dollar after Repsol YPF SA said its Brazilian unit will get a
$7.1  billion investment from China Petrochemical Corp.,
boosting the outlook for inflows.  The real strengthened as much as 0.8 percent against the
dollar to 1.6735.  Fed Talk  Speeches by Fed officials continued to fuel speculation
about more assets purchases by the central bank.  Fed Bank of Chicago President  Charles Evans , speaking at a
Conference in Rome, said further monetary accommodation may be
“desirable” to help boost the flagging U.S. recovery.  “We still have a long road ahead before we catch up to the
level of activity we would have achieved in the absence of the
crisis, or any other shock,” Evans said.  Fed Bank of New York President  William Dudley  said today in
New York that more action from the central bank to support the
economy is needed.  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index fell to
54.4 in September from 56.3 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said today. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.
Economists forecast the gauge to drop to 54.5, according to the
median of 83 projections in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates
ranged from 51.5 to 57.  Factory Output  “The ISM headline number does fit in the sweet spot where
data is inconsistent with a double dip, but not too strong to
short circuit Fed QE expectations,”  Alan Ruskin , global head of
Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New
York wrote in a note to clients.  Next week, Nonfarm U.S. payrolls are expected to show no
change in employment in September, after a loss of 54,000 jobs
in August.  The yen traded near the strongest levels against the dollar
since the Bank of Japan stepped in Sept. 15 to sell yen in an
attempt to weaken the currency.  “We think in the range from 82 to 83 it’s highly likely to
see some action from the Japanese and we do think intervention
is very likely,” said  Jens Nordvig , a managing director of
currency research in New York at Nomura Holdings Inc.  Mizuho Financial’s Yanagihara said he sees intervention
coming 20 or 30 points lower than the 82.80-to-83 range the
market expects, he said.  Index Measures  The Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currencies Indices show
the dollar has declined 2.4 percent this year against a basket
of currencies from 10 developed-world nations, while the yen is
up 10.3 percent and the euro is down 6.5 percent.  The Swiss franc furthered gains on the greenback touching
0.9749 per dollar, near a record high of 0.9709 reached
yesterday. The Swiss franc reached 1.3464 per euro, the weakest
level since Aug. 13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
