LodgeNet Interactive Corp., a
provider of television and Internet access for hotels, canceled
its planned $435 million offering of six-year notes, according
to a statement distributed by PR Newswire.  The company withdrew the offering because “pricing and
terms were not acceptable,” LodgeNet said in the statement. It
planned to use proceeds from the debt to refinance bank loans
and pay swap breakage fees.   To contact the reporter on this story:
