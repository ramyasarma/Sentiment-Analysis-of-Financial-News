DuPont Co. , the third-largest U.S.
chemical maker, said it’s “aggressively” pursuing takeovers of
companies involved in food production, alternative energy and
other areas DuPont is targeting for growth.  “We are looking very seriously and aggressively at
acquisitions,”  Jeffrey Keefer , a DuPont executive vice
president, said today at an Oppenheimer & Co. conference in New
York. “We are going to do deals that are strategically
compelling and financially compelling.”  Any purchases will be tied to the so-called megatrends that
include increased food production, alternative energy and
protecting lives, Keefer said.  Chief Executive Officer  Ellen Kullman  is investing in
modified crop seeds, biofuels, Kevlar fibers and solar-energy
materials to help boost earnings 20 percent a year through 2012.
Sales will rise more than 15 percent this year amid strong
demand for titanium dioxide pigment, farm products, electronics,
solar-energy materials and car parts, Keefer said.  Titanium dioxide pigment is used in paints and plastics.  DuPont, based in Wilmington, Delaware, rose 9 cents to
$44.62 at 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange  composite
trading . The shares have gained 33 percent this year.  Dow Chemical Co.  is the largest U.S. chemical maker based
on 2009 sales, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
