Telecom to acquire two supplementary cable ships, in addition to
the four ships already operated by the group.”  Kaufman & Broad SA  (KOF FP) advanced 3.6 percent to 19.93
euros, a fifth straight gain. The real-estate developer said it

services provider, gained 2 percent to 60.19 euros, the highest
