Poland plans to sell from 8.9
billion zloty to 15.9 billion zloty ($3.05 billion) in domestic
bonds in the fourth quarter, limiting supply to the lowest
amount this year after meeting most of its borrowing needs, the
Finance Ministry said in a e-mailed statement today.  The ministry plans to offer as much as 3 billion zloty of
bonds maturing in 2013 on Oct. 6 and as much as 3 billion zloty
of notes due in 2016 on Oct. 15, according to the statement. It
is also offering as much as 3.5 billion zloty of 10-year bonds
in November. The ministry plans to sell as much as 4.5 billion
zloty of either or both 2013 and 2016 bonds in December and may
sell up to 1.86 billion zloty of road bonds “depending on
financing needs,” it said.  Poland may also sell bonds in yen in the fourth quarter and
borrow 700 million euro from the European Investment Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
