Loy Yang Power, the operator of the
biggest power station in Australia’s Victoria state, agreed to
A$490 million ($475 million) in loans to refinance debt.  It refinanced A$455 million of senior bank debt and a A$35
million working capital facility, extending the maturity by five
years to November 2015, the company said in an e-mailed
statement. Loy Yang Power’s other facilities remain unchanged.  “The new debt facility attracted strong backing from three
new Japanese banks together with significant support by a
syndicate of existing lenders,” Loy Yang Power Chief Executive
 Ian Nethercote  said in the statement, without naming the banks.  AGL Energy Ltd.  and Tokyo Electric Power Co. own the two
biggest stakes in Loy Yang Power’s parent company, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
