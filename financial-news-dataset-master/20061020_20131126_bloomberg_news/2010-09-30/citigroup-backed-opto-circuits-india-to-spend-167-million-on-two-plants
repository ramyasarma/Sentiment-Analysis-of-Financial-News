Opto Circuits India Ltd.  plans to
spend 7.5 billion rupees ($167 million) over three years to set
up two medical equipment factories in India and Malaysia as the
global incidence of diabetes and heart disease rises.  People are becoming more aware of lifestyle diseases, said
 Vinod Ramnani , managing director at Opto Circuits, India’s
largest domestic medical equipment maker. “That is the main
driver” for growth, he said.  The company, based in Bangalore, makes stents, small tubes
used to treat narrowed arteries, and patient-monitoring systems.
More than 220 million people worldwide have diabetes and the
number may double by 2030, according to the  World Health
Organization . About 17 million people die of heart disease every
year, WHO said in a statement on its website. India has the
highest number of deaths globally from coronary heart disease.  Opto Circuits’s shares, which have gained 31 percent this
year, fell 1 percent to 296.80 rupees at close of trading in
Mumbai.  The company, which competes with Johnson & Johnson, General
Electric Co., Siemens AG and  Royal Philips Electronics NV,  will
begin work shortly on the Malaysian plant, Ramnani said. The
Indian facility in the southern city of Mysore is being designed,
he said.  Shareholders  on Sept. 28 approved raising as much as 20
billion rupees to fund expansion at units in the U.S. and Europe,
Ramnani said.  Citigroup Global Markets owns 3 percent of Opto Circuits,
according to data on the Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
