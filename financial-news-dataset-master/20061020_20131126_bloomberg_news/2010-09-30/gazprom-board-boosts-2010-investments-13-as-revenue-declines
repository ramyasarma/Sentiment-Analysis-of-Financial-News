The board of OAO Gazprom, the
world’s biggest gas producer, approved a 13 percent increase in
this year’s investments, from an initial plan, to cover
transportation projects and developments in Russia’s east, even
as budget revenues fall.  Gazprom plans to spend 905.2 billion rubles ($30 billion),
which includes 751.8 billion rubles for capital expenditures,
the Moscow-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
Gazprom cut its budget revenue for the year to 3.64 trillion
rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
