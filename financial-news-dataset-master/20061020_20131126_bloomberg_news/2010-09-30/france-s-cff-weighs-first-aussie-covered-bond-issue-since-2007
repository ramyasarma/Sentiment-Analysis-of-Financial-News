Compagnie de Financement Foncier is
considering selling the first covered bonds in Australian
dollars since the start of the credit crisis in 2007.  CFF, as the funding unit of  Credit Foncier de France  is
known, wants to diversify its investor base, said  Paul Dudouit ,
head of medium- and long-term funding at the Paris-based
company. CFF raised 15 billion euros ($20 billion) from covered
bond sales this year, with dollar and Swiss-franc deals
accounting for more than 30 percent of the total, he said.  Banks in Europe issued 168 billion euros of covered bonds
so far this year, the most since 2006 when they sold 179 billion
euros, according to data compiled by Societe Generale SA.  “We see some improvement of investor appetite for our
existing Australian line,” said Dudouit. “So definitely we
will return to the currency subject to market conditions,
hopefully in the following 12 months.”  Covered bonds typically attract higher credit ratings than
regular notes because they’re also backed by assets such as
mortgages that stay on the lender’s balance sheet and can be
sold in a default.  CFF’s A$750 million ($723 million) of 5.5 percent covered
bonds due 2015 are trading at 95.6 percent of face value
compared with 92.7 percent at the end of last year, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. Dexia Municipal Agency was the
last European issuer of Australian dollar-denominated covered
bonds when it sold A$29 million of the notes in July 2007,
Bloomberg data show.  CFF is also considering issuing covered bonds in pounds for
the first time in more than three years, Dudouit said. CFF’s 300
million pounds of 5.5 percent bonds due 2027 are trading at 110
percent of face value, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
