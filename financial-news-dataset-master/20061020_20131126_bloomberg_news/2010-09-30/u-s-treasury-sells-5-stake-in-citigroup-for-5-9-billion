The  U.S. Treasury Department  earned a
$1.02 billion profit for taxpayers from the sale of a 5 percent
stake in  Citigroup Inc.  during the past nine weeks as markets
slowed and the bank’s share price fell.  The Treasury sold 1.5 billion shares since July 26 for $5.9
billion, it said yesterday in a  statement . That equals an
average price of $3.93 a share, more than the $3.25 taxpayers
paid for a stake in the New York-based bank during the financial
crisis of 2008. The sales were handled by  Morgan Stanley .  Treasury’s stake in Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank
by deposits, fell to 3.6 billion shares, or about 12 percent.
The stake is worth about $14 billion. The department, headed by
Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner , sold shares at a rate of 31
million a day, less than half the pace it needs to meet its goal
of exiting the bank by the end of this year.  “I don’t think that’s good from Treasury’s point of view
and I don’t think that’s good from Citigroup’s point of view,”
 Linus Wilson , a finance professor at the University of Louisiana,
said in a telephone interview. “The longer the sale takes, the
more chances that Treasury is going to have to sell some shares
at a loss.”  U.S. taxpayers received Citigroup shares in the bank’s $45
billion bailout in 2008. Citigroup repaid $20 billion and the
department converted the remaining $25 billion into a 27 percent
stake. Treasury has been selling shares since April this year.  Return for Taxpayers  “We are pleased that U.S. Treasury continues to make
progress in profitably selling its securities in Citi, adding to
the substantial return for taxpayers realized last year when we
repaid the December 2008 TARP investment,” said  Jon Diat , a
Citigroup spokesman. “We continue to be very appreciative of
the support provided by the U.S. Treasury during the financial
crisis.”  Treasury sold 1.1 billion shares at 46 million a day from
May 27 through June 30. From April 26 through May 26, Treasury
sold 1.5 billion shares, or about 65 million a day. To dispose
of its stake by the department’s goal of Dec. 14 or by the end
of the year, Treasury must sell at a rate of 76 million to 100
million shares a day, Wilson said.  “It is unlikely,” Wilson said in an e-mail. “We should
expect the share sale should extend into 2011 if an underwritten
secondary offering is not employed to speed the taxpayers’
exit.”  Citigroup’s share price has declined 5.8 percent since July
26, during the most recent trading period, compared with a 2.4
percent gain for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index .  Treasury also announced plans this week to sell about $2.2
billion in trust preferred securities, or TruPS, that it
received as compensation for guaranteeing Citigroup assets. The
sale may be complete Oct. 5, Treasury said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
