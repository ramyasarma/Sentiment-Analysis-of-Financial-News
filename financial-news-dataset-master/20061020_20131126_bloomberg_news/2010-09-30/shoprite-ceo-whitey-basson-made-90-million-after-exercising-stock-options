Shoprite Holdings Ltd. , South
Africa’s largest retailer by market value, said Chief Executive
Officer  Whitey Basson  earned 627.5 million rand ($90 million) in
its last financial year, after he exercised 594.5 million rand
worth of share options.  Basson was paid a 25.4 million-rand salary and benefits
totaling 7.7 million rand in the year through June, the  Cape
Town -town-based company said in its annual report, which was
posted on its website today. In the previous financial year,
Basson earned 24.1 million rand in salary and benefits and
didn’t exercise any share options.  Shoprite’s net income excluding minority interests rose 13
percent to 2.27 billion rand in the year through June from a
year earlier, as it opened more stores and won customers.  The retailer’s  shares  have surged 59 percent over the past
12 months, while those of No. 2 grocer Pick n Pay have gained
8.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
