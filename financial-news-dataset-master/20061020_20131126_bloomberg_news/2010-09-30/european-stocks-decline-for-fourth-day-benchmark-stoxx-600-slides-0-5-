European stocks retreated for a
fourth straight day amid concern that the cost of bailing out
the region’s banks is rising. U.S. index futures and Asian
shares fell.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.5 percent to 259.82 at
8:03 a.m. in London. The measure has rallied 6.9 percent so far
this quarter, poised for its biggest three-month advance in a
year, driven by an increase in takeover activity and optimism
the global economy will avoid another recession. Still,
lingering concern that some European countries may struggle to
repay their debt has left the gauge 4.5 percent below its April
high.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
