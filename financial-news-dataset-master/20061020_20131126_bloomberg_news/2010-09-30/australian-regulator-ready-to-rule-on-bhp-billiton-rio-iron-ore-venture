Australia’s competition regulator
has all the information it needs to rule on the planned iron-ore
venture of  BHP Billiton Ltd.  and Rio Tinto Group, handing the
timing of any verdict back to the companies.  “We’ve been ready for some time, but they don’t want us to
make a decision,”  Graeme Samuel , chairman of the  Australian
Competition & Consumer Commission , said in an interview today in
Sydney. “We’ve got all the information we need.”  The regulator said Sept. 15 it delayed its decision after
Rio and BHP, the second-biggest and third-largest exporters of
iron ore, sought more time to make submissions and hold talks
with overseas watchdogs. The companies are considering changes
or a delay to the venture in Australia, the Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday.  BHP and Rio “own the process,” Samuel said in the
interview, rejecting accusations the regulator is taking too
long. The commission won’t announce a ruling until reviewing its
final internal report on the venture, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
