Ohio Secretary of State
Jennifer Brunner has asked the U.S. Attorney’s office in
Cleveland to investigate allegations of foreclosure fraud.  Brunner made the requests in two letters to U.S. Attorney
Stephen Dettelbach. The letters, delivered August 11 and
September 1, were posted today on the Secretary of State’s web
site.  Brunner is seeking a criminal investigation for loan fraud
and mail fraud, she said in a telephone interview. She cited a
May deposition from an employee of Chase Home Finance, a unit of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. The company yesterday said it is asking
judges to postpone rulings in pending foreclosure cases while
the bank reviews and possibly resubmits statements.  Courts should require “absolute adherence to the law”
during foreclosures, Brunner wrote, “even if it means
prosecuting some of our largest corporations."  To contact the reporter on this story:
