The City of New York and National Grid
NY oppose a settlement between  Chemtura Corp. , the bankrupt
Connecticut chemical maker, and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, saying it’s unfair and not in the public
interest.  Chemtura, which emerged from Chapter 11 protection in
November, needs final approval of environmental settlements that
involve the Gowanus Canal, a toxic site in New York, following a
period that sought public comment. According to court papers
filed by the U.S. today, one comment was received, from the City
of New York and Brooklyn Union Gas Co., which does business as
National Grid.  “At this time, there is simply no way to determine if the
proposed agreement will provide enough money to pay Chemtura’s
significant share of the liability caused by its operations on
the Gowanus Canal,” the city and National Grid said in a letter
dated Nov. 12.  The U.S. said it supports the agreement, which requires
Chemtura to clean two sources of ongoing pollution to the
Gowanus Canal. The settlement allows the EPA a $3.9 million
claim in Chemtura’s bankruptcy to resolve its claim that
Chemtura was one of many parties that should contribute to
clean-up costs of around $1 billion.  National Grid is also a “potentially responsible party”
for pollution at the site, according to the EPA.  The case is In re Chemtura Corp., 09-11233, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
