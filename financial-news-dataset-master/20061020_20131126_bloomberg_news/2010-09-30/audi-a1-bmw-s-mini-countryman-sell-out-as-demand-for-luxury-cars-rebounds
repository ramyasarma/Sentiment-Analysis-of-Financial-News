Volkswagen AG ’s Audi luxury
division and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s Mini unit are selling
out of their new small cars as consumer demand for premium
vehicles rebounds.  Audi, based in Ingolstadt, Germany, will sell all of the
40,000 A1 compacts the carmaker planned to build this year by
mid-October, Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Stadler  said during
a briefing at the Paris Motor Show. Mini’s family sized
Countryman crossover has sold out in the U.K. until February,
BMW sales chief  Ian Robertson  said at the show.  The A1, which targets young professionals and first-time
customers, went on sale in Europe last month at a starting price
of 15,800 euros ($21,570). BMW, which aims to broaden the
audience of the trendy brand with Mini’s biggest model ever,
began delivering the Countryman this month. The base price is
20,200 euros.  “It goes to show there’s still a lot of potential in this
niche of small, sporty premium cars,” said  Aleksej Wunrau , an
analyst at BHF-Bank AG. “It also sends out a signal that new
additions to the line-up can be very rewarding.”  Audi has had “double-digit” growth in deliveries in
September buoyed by the new A1 compact, Stadler said, adding
that the brand has record orders in Europe.  Audi expects to sell more than 100,000 cars and sport-
utility vehicles in the U.S. for the first time this year and
sees Chinese deliveries exceeding 300,000 by 2015, sales chief
 Peter Schwarzenbauer  said at the same briefing.  BMW, the world’s largest maker of luxury cars, said
September deliveries probably grew at a double-digit pace. China
sales this year will top Munich-based BMW’s target of 120,000
vehicles, Robertson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
