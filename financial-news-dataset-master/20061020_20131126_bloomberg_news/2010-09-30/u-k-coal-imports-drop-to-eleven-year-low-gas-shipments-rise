U.K. coal imports declined to the
lowest level since 1999 in the second quarter as power
generators used up stockpiles. Natural gas shipments rose as
local supply fell and electricity generators favored the fuel.  U.K. second-quarter coal imports declined 45 percent from a
year earlier to 5.3 million metric tons, the Department of
Energy and Climate Change said today in a quarterly  report . Coal
stockpiles were at 20.2 million tons at the end of June, 0.8
million tons lower than last year, the DECC said.  About 80 percent of Britain’s power stations are fed with
fossil fuels and some utilities can switch feedstock depending
on prices. Lower natural gas prices, relative to coal costs,
raise the profitability from gas-fed stations.  U.K. second-quarter natural gas imports increased 54
percent to 128.2 terawatt-hours while exports advanced 28
percent to 58 terawatt-hours, the DECC said. Liquefied natural
gas accounted for about a third of total imports, according to
the department. Demand for the fuel rose 9.6 percent from a year
earlier to 219.5 terawatt-hours.  Atomic stations account for about 20 percent of U.K. power-
generating capacity. Electricity supplied by the nation’s
nuclear reactors in the second quarter fell 23 percent to 12.6
terawatt-hours compared with the same period last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
