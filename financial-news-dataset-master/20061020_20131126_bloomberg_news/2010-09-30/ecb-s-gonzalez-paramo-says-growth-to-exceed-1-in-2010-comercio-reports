European Central Bank Executive
Board member  Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo  told Peru’s  El Comercio 
newspaper that European economic growth will exceed 1 percent
this year.  Growth in credit lending is exceeding 1 percent, with
mortgage lending outpacing growth in corporate loans, which is
close to zero, Gonzalez-Paramo said.  Europe must guard against excessive wholesale funding and
the size of financial institutions, Gonzalez-Paramo told El
Comercio.  To contact the reporters on this story:
