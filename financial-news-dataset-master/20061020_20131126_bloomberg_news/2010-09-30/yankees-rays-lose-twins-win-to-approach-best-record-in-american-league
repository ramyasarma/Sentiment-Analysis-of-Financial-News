The Yankees and Tampa Bay lost
to leave the Rays a half-game ahead of New York in the
battle for the American League East title.  Aaron Hill  hit a three-run home run and added a run-
scoring single as the host Toronto Blue Jays defeated the
Yankees 8-4.  Alex Rodriguez  hit his 30th home run of the
season, and No. 613 of his career, for the Yankees.
Rodriguez, who now has 13 straight seasons with at least 30
home runs, is sixth on Major League Baseball’s career list.  The Rays lost 2-0 at home to the Baltimore Orioles,
the second time in three nights that Tampa was shut out and
held to three hits by Baltimore pitchers.  The loss by both AL East teams became more significant
when the Minnesota Twins, champions of the AL Central,
broke a five-game losing streak with a 4-2 win at Kansas
City.  The Twins (93-65), Yankees (94-65) and Rays (94-64)
are battling for home-field advantage in the playoffs,
which is based in part on each team’s record.  In the National League wild-card race, Atlanta
maintained its lead of 1 1/2 games over the San Diego
Padres.  Brooks Conrad  hit a three-run homer and pitcher  Derek Lowe  won his 16th game of the season as the Braves
completed a three-game sweep by winning 5-1 against the
visiting Florida Marlins. The Padres beat the Chicago Cubs
3-0 at home last night.  The Padres also are competing for the NL West title
against the San Francisco Giants, who beat the visiting
Arizona Diamondbacks 3-1. The Giants leads the Padres by
two games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
