Independencia SA, the Brazilian
meatpacker whose creditors include JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Citigroup Inc., will miss an interest payment on its 2015 senior
notes as it struggles to generate cash.  The company was due to pay interest today of about $12
million on $165 million of the 15 percent bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Independencia said in a  statement  on
its website it is in talks with creditors to restructure debt.  “The company has continued to struggle with its working
capital requirements and has been unable to resume its
operations at the level that will be sufficient to meet its
projected obligations,” Independencia said in the statement.  The bonds fell 5.625 cents on the dollar to 48.125 cents at
11:54 a.m. New York time, the lowest since they were issued in
March, according to Trace, the bond price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The Cajamar, Brazil-based meatpacker filed for bankruptcy
protection in February 2009. As of June 30, it had debt of 1.5
billion reais ($885 million) and cash of 5.4 million reais.  “There will be a pretty complicated and litigious process
going forward,”  Ruth Mazzoni , a bond analyst at Standard Bank
New York, said today in a telephone interview. Mazzoni said in a
report dated Sept. 24 that she expects a legal battle over which
plants will be available to pay back bondholders.  Citigroup, JPMorgan  Independencia owes Citigroup 24.9 million reais, according
to documents provided by the bankruptcy court. JPMorgan is owed
about 138 million reais, according to the documents.  In February 2009, Independencia defaulted on $525 million
of bonds, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Five months
later Independencia restructured those securities into 12
percent bonds due in 2016 that now trade at 8.75 cents on the
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities
allow the borrower to make interest payments with additional
bonds instead of cash, a feature known as pay-in-kind.  Fernanda Flausino, an investor relations manager for
Independencia, declined to comment on when the company may make
the payment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
