The Australian dollar rallied for a
seventh straight week in the longest winning streak since May
2009 as traders  increased bets  that the Reserve Bank will boost
borrowing costs when it meets Oct. 5.  The Aussie rose to a two-year high versus the U.S. dollar
today after an expansion in Chinese manufacturing boosted trade
prospects for the South Pacific nation. New Zealand’s currency
rose to the highest level since November as Asian stocks
rallied, fueling demand for higher-yielding assets.  “As long as Asia -- China and India in particular --
continues to grow strongly, it will mitigate concerns on the
U.S. and euro-zone front,” said  Sue Trinh , a senior currency
strategist in Hong Kong at Royal Bank of Canada. “The market
continues to anticipate the risk of a rate hike next week,
giving the Aussie a lift.”  Australia’s currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 97.25 U.S.
cents at 2:16 p.m. in New York, from 96.71 cents yesterday. It
touched 97.51, the highest level since July 2008. The currency
gained 1.4 percent this week. New Zealand’s dollar climbed 1.5
percent to 74.50 cents, from 73.43 cents, after reaching 74.63,
the highest level since Nov. 19.  China’s government said its purchasing managers’ index rose
to 53.8 in September from 51.7 in the previous month. Readings
above 50 show growth. China is Australia’s largest trading
partner and New Zealand’s second-biggest export market.  There’s a 64 percent chance Reserve Bank of Australia
Governor  Glenn Stevens  will raise the 4.50 percent target
lending rate next week, up from 52 percent odds yesterday,
according to an index compiled by Credit Suisse Group AG.  The Australian dollar’s 14-day relative strength index
against the greenback was 75 in the sixth day it has remained
over the 70 level that indicates an asset’s price may reverse
direction after rising too rapidly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
