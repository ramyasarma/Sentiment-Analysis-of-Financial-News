Japan sold 2.12 trillion yen ($25
billion) from Aug. 28 through Sept. 28, the Ministry of Finance
said in Tokyo today, representing the nation’s attempt to weaken
its currency and preserve an export-led recovery.  The yen rose to a 15-year high against the dollar on Sept.
15, prompting the Japanese government to intervene in the
foreign-exchange market for the first time since 2004. The yen
has risen 12 percent against the dollar this year, the best
performance among 16 major counterparts, as concern the U.S.
economic recovery will slow and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis
will worsen boosted demand for Japan’s currency as a refuge.  “They still have abundant resources for intervention and
will likely continue to step in,” said  Masahide Tanaka , a
senior strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit
of Japan’s second-largest bank. “They will not let the yen rise
beyond 80 against the dollar, which would severely damp
sentiment among companies.”  The yen traded at 83.28 per dollar at 11:08 a.m. in London
from 83.70 in New York yesterday. It climbed to 82.88 on Sept.
15, the highest level since May 1995. The currency was at 113.78
per euro from 114.06.  Bank of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  signaled this week
the central bank is prepared to take more credit-easing steps
should the strengthening currency become a risk to the country’s
growth.  Tankan, Exports  “We will watch how the yen’s strength is affecting the
economy, and if it becomes a downside risk we will take action
in a timely and appropriate manner,” Shirakawa said on Sept. 27
in Osaka, western Japan.  The Tankan  index  of sentiment among large manufacturers
climbed 7 points in September to a level of 8, the Bank of Japan
said yesterday. The figure was the smallest improvement in six
quarters and compares with a 15-point increase in June.
Confidence will fall to minus 1 in December, the report said.
The companies predicted the yen will average 89.44 per dollar in
the six months ending March 2011, according to the survey.  Government data this week showed  exports  grew at the
slowest pace this year in August, suggesting the yen’s strength
may be hurting earnings at companies such as  Nissan Motor Inc. 
and  Canon Inc.   Even 90 yen to the dollar may not be weak enough to prevent
production from draining out of the country,  Toshiyuki Shiga ,
chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said
on Sept. 16. Many automakers are basing profit forecasts on the
90 yen rate, and the currency should revert to that level or
weaker, said Shiga, who is also chief operating officer at
Nissan, Japan’s third-biggest carmaker.  Profit Impact  Canon, which is based in Tokyo and is the world’s largest
camera maker, estimates that  operating profit  will shrink by 4.7
billion yen for every 1 yen the currency strengthens beyond 90
per dollar in the second half of 2010.  Japan hadn’t intervened in the currency market since March
2004, when the yen traded at about 109 per dollar. The Bank of
Japan, acting on behest of the Ministry of Finance, sold 14.8
trillion yen in the first three months of 2004 following record
sales of 20.4 trillion yen in 2003.  The action failed to keep the currency from rising to
102.63 to the dollar by the end of that year.  Deposits of financial institutions held at the Bank of
Japan climbed by 2 trillion yen to 17.1 trillion yen on Sept. 17,
the central bank said that day, indicating it didn’t mop up
extra funds in the market after its yen sales that week.  Central banks conduct bill auctions to drain excess
currency stemming from foreign purchases, a process called
sterilization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
