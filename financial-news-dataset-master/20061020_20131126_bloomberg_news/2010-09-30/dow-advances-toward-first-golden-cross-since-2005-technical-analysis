The  Dow Jones Industrial Average ,
for the first time since 2005, is approaching the formation of 
a “golden cross” chart usually seen as bullish. If history 
is a guide, investors should ignore the signal, said Bespoke
Investment Group LLC.  The 50-day moving average for the Dow was 0.1 percent away
from exceeding the average price for the prior 200 days.
Technical analysts, who study price charts to predict market
moves, calls it a “golden cross” when a 50-day average moves
higher than a 200-day average while both are rising, and say
that it shows a pickup in momentum that may herald more gains.  Bespoke studied the benchmark’s 36 “golden crosses” since
1900 and found that the results were “anything but stellar.”
In the three months following the signals, the Dow increased 0.3
percent on average with positive returns occurring 44 percent of
the time. That lagged behind the benchmark’s overall three-month
average gain of 1.6 percent, Harrison, New York-based Bespoke
found.  “While you may hear people cite the upcoming ‘golden
cross’ as a positive indicator for the market, the historical
numbers tell a different story,” according to a report sent
yesterday by Bespoke’s co-founder  Justin Walters . “Golden
crosses may work for some securities, but they haven’t for the
Dow.”  The Dow average, which slipped 0.2 percent to 10,835.28
yesterday, may generate a “golden cross” within a week,
Bespoke said. Its 50-day average was 10,456.83, less than 15
points away from its 200-day average of 10,471.64.  To contact the reporter on this story:
