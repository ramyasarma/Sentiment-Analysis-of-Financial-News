             Fyffes Plc (FFY) , the Irish tropical-fruit
distributor that received its first banana shipment in 1888, won
its appeal against the verdict in an  insider-trading  case
involving distributor  DCC Plc. (DCC)   
 Fyffes last year lost a lawsuit against DCC and its chief
executive officer, Jim Flavin, that centered on a sale of stock
in the fruit distributor in February 2000. Dublin-based Fyffes
argued that DCC, which reaped an 85 million-euro ($116 million)
profit on the transaction, sold the 10 percent stake knowing the
shares probably would fall.  
 The court was ``satisfied'' that Flavin had price-sensitive
information, Judge Susan Denham, one of the five Supreme Court
judges who heard the appeal, said in a ruling issued today.  
 Shares of Fyffes rose as much as 9 cents, or 11 percent, to
89 euro cents in Dublin and were up 6.3 percent at 85 cents at
1:20 p.m. local time. Stock in DCC, which distributes goods from
liquefied petroleum gas to computer software, dropped 74 cents,
or 3.4 percent, to 20.96 euros, rebounding from a slide of as
much as 6.9 percent.  
 DCC said in a Regulatory News Service statement its liability
to Fyffes and legal costs won't exceed 50 million euros. The
amount it owes is expected to be assessed by the  High Court , the
company said.  
 Inside Knowledge  
 ``The board is pleased that its Supreme Court appeal has
been successful,'' Fyffes said in a statement. The company said
it ``has always believed in the merit of the legal action.''  
 The case, which pitted two of the country's best-known
businesses against each other, was the first in which an Irish
company sued another for insider trading. Fyffes claimed that
Flavin had inside knowledge when selling 31.2 million of its shares
in three blocks beginning Feb. 3, 2000. Six weeks later, the stock
slid 25 percent in two days after Fyffes said profit would fall.  
 Fyffes said that Flavin, who sat on its board for 19 years
until Feb. 9, 2000, had access to information on its performance
in the last two months of 1999 and forecasts for January 2000.
At the original hearing last year, one of the longest cases ever
heard before the High Court, Judge Mary Laffoy said the figures
available to Flavin would not have influenced the shares.  
 Judge Laffoy ``erred in concluding that the information in
the possession of Mr. Flavin relating to the business of Fyffes,
on three dates in February 2000, when Mr. Flavin dealt in the
shares of Fyffes, was not price-sensitive,'' Judge Denham said.  
 After selling half of the shares on Feb. 3, 2000, DCC
testified in the trial that it was ``encouraged'' by the fruit
distributor's management to dispose of the rest, which it sold
on Feb. 8 and Feb 14 of that year. DCC sold the shares for as
much as 3.90 euros each, for a total of 106.7 million euros.  
 The case number is 144/06  Fyffes Plc (FFY)  vs DCC Plc.
