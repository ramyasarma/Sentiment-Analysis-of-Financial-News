             Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA  said
second-quarter profit plunged 90 percent, missing analysts'
estimates, as gold production fell. The company's American
depositary receipts dropped the most in 10 months.  
 Net income fell to $14.5 million, or 11 cents a share, from
$139.8 million, or $1.10, a year earlier, the Lima-based company
said today in a statement. Profit was reduced $64.7 million by
the buyback of 488,000 ounces from the company's hedge book in
May. Sales rose 9 percent to $187.8 million.  
 ``Investors weren't expecting this,'' Fernando Romero, a
trader at Lima-based brokerage Investa SAB, said in a phone
interview. ``Buenaventura hasn't been doing very well in hedging
operations this year.''  
 Gold production fell 51 percent to 226,851 ounces on
declines at Denver-based  Newmont Gold Corp. (NEM) 's Yanacocha gold
mine, in which Buenaventura holds a 44 percent stake. Silver
output fell 12 percent to 3.88 million ounces and zinc
production rose 37 percent to 19,750 tons.  
 Buenaventura's ADRs, each representing one ordinary share,
fell $2.22, or 5.4 percent, to $38.80 in  New York  Stock Exchange
composite  trading  at 4:04 p.m., the biggest drop since Sept. 11.
They have climbed 40 percent this year.  
 Hedge Reduction  
 Profit of 94 cents a share was expected, the average
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Chief Executive
Officer Roque Benavides said in April that the company would
reduce its hedge book, or gold sold forward to protect against
declining prices, to take advantage of a surge in the metal.  
 Buenaventura said it sold gold for an average of $662 an
ounce during the second quarter, up 18 percent from $561 a year
earlier. The company's silver price rose 10 percent to $13.39
and ounce and zinc jumped 16 percent to $3,722 a ton.  
 Cash costs at Yanacocha more than doubled to $436 an ounce
from $192 an ounce a year earlier. Buenaventura's income from
affiliates, including Yanacocha and an 18.5 percent stake in
Phoenix-based Freeport- McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 's Cerro Verde
copper mine, fell by half to $48.8 million.  
 ``The company's solid cash flows and the improved political
situation in  Peru  seem set to allow Buenaventura to develop more
of its own new projects and hopefully reduce the importance of
Yanacocha in its portfolio,'' John Bridges, an analyst at J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc., wrote in a June 25 report. He rates the
share ``overweight''.  
 Sales in last year's second quarter were $172.5 million.
