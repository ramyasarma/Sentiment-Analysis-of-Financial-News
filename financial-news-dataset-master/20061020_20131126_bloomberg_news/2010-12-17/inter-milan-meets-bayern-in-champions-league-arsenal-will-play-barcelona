Inter Milan will face Bayern Munich
in the Champions League round of 16, a rematch of last year’s
final, while Arsenal takes on Barcelona.  Roma is drawn against Shakhtar Donetsk, AC Milan faces
Tottenham, Valencia meets Schalke, Lyon plays Real Madrid,
Marseille meets Manchester United and Copenhagen plays Chelsea
in the other matchups from today’s draw in Nyon, Switzerland.  The two-match series in the first knockout stage of
European soccer’s elite club competition will be played between
Feb. 15 and March 16. The final will be held on May 28 at
London’s Wembley Stadium.  Defending champion Inter finished second in its group to
Tottenham to set up a rematch possibility with Bayern. Inter won
its third European title by beating the German side 2-0 in May
after two goals from  Diego Milito .  The pairing of Arsenal and Barcelona will also be a rematch
from last season. Barcelona progressed from that quarterfinal by
winning the second game 4-1, with  Lionel Messi  scoring all the
goals, after the teams tied 2-2 in London.  Tottenham, making its Champions League debut, will return
to Italy to face AC Milan after playing Inter in the group
stage. Nine-time champion Real Madrid will take on the fourth
semifinalist from last season in Lyon.  Barcelona and Real Madrid are the two favourites to lift
the trophy with U.K. bookmakers. Barcelona is listed with 9-4
odds with William Hill and 5-2 with Ladbrokes, while Real is
second-choice at 7-2 with both.  There are four teams from England in the final 16, three
each from Italy and Spain, two from Germany and France and one
from Ukraine and Denmark.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
