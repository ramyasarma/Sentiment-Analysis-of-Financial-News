The art collectors Ulla and Heiner
Pietzsch gave the city of Berlin 150 paintings, drawings and
sculptures by artists including  Salvador Dali  and  Rene Magritte 
with an estimated value of 120 million euros ($160 million).  Other artists in the collection -- which is focused mainly
on surrealism and abstract expressionism -- include  Frida Kahlo ,
 Jackson Pollock ,  Mark Rothko  and  Max Ernst . A condition for the
donation is that part of the collection be put on permanent
display in the city’s museums.  “My wife and I are happy that this is a first and decisive
step towards keeping our surrealism collection in the
Nationalgalerie in the long term,” Heiner Pietzsch said in a
statement sent by the  Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation .
“We know this closes a painful gap in the Nationalgalerie’s
collection.”  The couple’s collection was displayed last year at the  Neue
Nationalgalerie  in an exhibition called “Bildertraeume”
(Picture Dreams), which attracted 200,000 visitors.  Berlin Mayor  Klaus Wowereit  said in the statement that the
city is “grateful and happy about this generous gift.”  To contact the writer on the story:
