Aggreko Plc, the world’s largest
provider of mobile power-supplies, plans to boost its fleet of
gas-power generators by two-thirds as more customers seek to tap
waste gas as an alternative fuel to diesel.  Aggreko will add about 200 megawatts of natural gas-fueled
generators in 2011 to its existing 300-megawatt capacity, Chief
Executive Officer  Rupert Soames  said today. Though they are
double the cost of diesel varieties, gas generators harness
stranded gas that’s often disposed of by flaring.  “There are quite a lot of our customers in Africa, Asia,
who have gas nearby, but it’s called stranded gas, it’s gas that
they can’t really take to market,” Soames said.  Aggreko, which supplied generators for the soccer World Cup
in South Africa, will boost spending on its fleet by 23 percent
next year. Money will be channeled into cleaning up the
emissions of its North American fleet, Soames said.  “For customers that can get hold of gas, gas is generally
cheaper than diesel,” Soames said. “The other thing is, it’s
cleaner fuel.”  The company, based in Glasgow, today said business levels
in the fourth quarter were better than expected. It predicted
full-year revenue will increase 20 percent to 1.22 billion
pounds ($1.4 billion), with pretax profit up 25 percent to 305
million pounds. Shares of the company were little changed at
1,501 pence as of 9:49 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
