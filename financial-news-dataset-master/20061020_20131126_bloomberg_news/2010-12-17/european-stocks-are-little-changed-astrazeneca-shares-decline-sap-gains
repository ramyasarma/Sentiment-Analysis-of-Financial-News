European stocks were little changed
after European Union leaders agreed to create a permanent
crisis-management mechanism in 2013, offsetting a selloff in
AstraZeneca Plc.  AstraZeneca dropped 4.8 percent in London. SAP AG gained
1.3 percent after Oracle Corp., the second-largest software
maker, reported earnings that topped analysts’ predictions.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped less than 0.1
percent to 277.46 at 8:09 a.m. in London, headed for a weekly
gain of 0.5 percent. The measure rose for the eighth time in
nine days yesterday after better-than-forecast U.S. economic
data boosted speculation that the recovery is continuing.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures added less than 0.1 percent
today, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
