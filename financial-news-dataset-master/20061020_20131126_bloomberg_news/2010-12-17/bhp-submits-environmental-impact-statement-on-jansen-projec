BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
biggest mining company, submitted an environmental impact
statement on its planned Jansen potash project in Canada and
estimated the mine may operate for about 70 years.  The project is being designed to produce 8 million metric
tons of potash a year at full capacity, Melbourne-based BHP said
today in an e-mailed statement. The study was delivered to the
Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment and is expected to be
released for public comment in the first half of 2011, it said.  BHP last month scrapped a $40 billion bid for  Potash Corp.
of Saskatchewan Inc.  following opposition from Canada. Jansen
may cost $11.2 billion to build, according to Sanford C.
Bernstein Ltd., and BHP has said output may start in 2015. The
project may deliver C$90 billion ($89 billion) of royalties
during the mine’s lifespan, BHP said in October.  “Jansen is the first and the most advanced of our potash
growth options,”  Graham Kerr , president of BHP’s diamonds and
specialty products unit, said in the statement, describing
Jansen as a “world-class ore body.”  Drilling at the project to prepare for the ground-freezing
process required to sink the production and service shafts has
begun, BHP said. The company is scheduled to make a final
investment decision on the project by late 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
