Competition for private bankers in  Asia  will squeeze profit margins at wealth-management firms as
more companies enter the market, said Hanspeter Brunner, BSI
SA’s chief executive officer for the region.  Cost-to-income ratios at private banks in Asia, typically
between 70 percent and 80 percent, will be close to the high end
of that range in the next few years, Brunner, 58, said yesterday
in an interview in Hong Kong.  “Asia is the holy land for everybody at the moment,”
Brunner said. “There will be more newcomers.”    Barclays Plc ,  Morgan Stanley  and  UBS AG  are among banks
that expanded wealth management units in Asia as booming
economies created more millionaires in China,  India  and
Indonesia.  China Construction Bank Corp ., the nation’s second-
largest lender, said this month it will start offering private-
banking services in  Hong Kong .  Lugano, Switzerland-based BSI entered Hong Kong in 1981,
set up operations in  Singapore  in 2005 and established a
representative office in  Shanghai  last year. The company, which
employed 2,590 people globally in 2009, boosted its Asian
workforce eightfold since last year to more than 250 now.  The bank plans to add 50 to 70 employees in Hong Kong by
the end of 2011, almost doubling the size of its local team,
according to Esther Heer, deputy chief executive officer of
BSI’s Asian unit.  “We plan to have a maximum of 350 to 400 people in the
region,” said Heer, 53. “We will not put pressure on ourselves
that we have to hire every year.”  Hiring Costs  BSI oversaw 75.4 billion Swiss francs ($77.8 billion) of
wealth assets as of November, with Asia accounting for slightly
more than 10 percent, according to Brunner. The bank plans to
increase the share of assets managed in Asia to 25 percent
within five years.  The number of millionaires in the Asia-Pacific region
jumped 26 percent to around 3 million in 2009, matching  Europe 
for the first time, according to a survey by Capgemini SA and
Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. The number of high net worth
individuals in  China  increased 31 percent to 477,000 last year,
the report showed.  Pay increases helped push up cost-to-income ratios at Asian
fund managers to 86 percent in 2009 from 61.8 percent two years
earlier, according to data compiled by industry consultants at
Boston Consulting Group. The ratio at Swiss banks rose 12.9
percentage points to 66.7 percent in the same period.  ‘More Expensive’  Hiring next year “will be more expensive than 2010. And I
would guarantee that 2012 will be more expensive than 2011
unless there is another major correction,” said Brunner.
“The good news is the size of the cake is growing as well.”  While BSI serves wealthy Chinese individuals in Hong Kong,
it is currently barred from directly targeting the mainland
market. The company hasn’t made a final decision on how to
expand into China, Brunner said.  “One of the interesting opportunities would be the onshore
China private banking market,” he said. “It is not really well
developed right now, but within the next five to 15 years you
will see a very solid, very large onshore private banking in
China.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
