CFC Stanbic Bank Ltd. , Standard Bank
Group Ltd.’s Kenyan unit, started the sale of bonds worth 2.5
billion shillings ($31 million), the lender said in a statement
in the Nairobi-based Business Daily.  “Proceeds from each issue of notes will be applied by CFC
Stanbic Bank Ltd. for its general corporate capital purposes
including liquidity and capital management,” it said in the
statement. The bond sale will close Dec. 24.  The bonds will be sold at a yield of 7.25 percent,  Andrew Murugu , the Nairobi-based company’s head of global markets, said
in a phone interview today.  South Africa’s  Standard Bank , the continent’s largest bank,

lender by assets.  CFC Stanbic climbed 1.5 shillings, or 2.1 percent, to 73.5
shillings by 9:45 a.m. in Nairobi, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
