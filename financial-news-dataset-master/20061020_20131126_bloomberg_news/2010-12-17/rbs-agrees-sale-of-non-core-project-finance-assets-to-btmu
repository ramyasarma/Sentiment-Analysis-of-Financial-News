Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
sold about 3.9 billion pounds ($6.1 billion) of project finance
assets to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  Mitsubishi UFJ agreed last month to buy the assets,
including loans for electricity, natural-resource and
infrastructure projects in Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
the Tokyo-based lender said in a statement today. RBS is in
talks with the Japanese company about further project finance
asset sales, it said.  RBS ’s Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  is shrinking
the bank’s balance sheet after it received the world’s biggest
banking bailout in 2008. It has since pared non-core assets by
110 billion pounds to 154 billion pounds, as of September, and
plans to sell the remainder by 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
