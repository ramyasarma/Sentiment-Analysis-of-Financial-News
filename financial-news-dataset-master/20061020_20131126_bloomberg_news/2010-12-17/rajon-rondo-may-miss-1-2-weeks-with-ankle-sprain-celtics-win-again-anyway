Boston Celtics point guard  Rajon Rondo  may be sidelined for as long as two weeks by a sprained
left ankle, Celtics coach  Doc Rivers  said.  Rondo didn’t play last night as the Celtics extended their
winning streak to 12 games with a 102-90 victory at home against
the Atlanta Hawks.  “One or two weeks, we’ll see,” Rivers told reporters
before the game when asked how long Rondo will be out.  Rondo, who leads the National Basketball Association with
13.8 assists per game and is scoring 11.2 points per contest,
hurt his ankle in the fourth quarter of a win at the New York
Knicks two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
