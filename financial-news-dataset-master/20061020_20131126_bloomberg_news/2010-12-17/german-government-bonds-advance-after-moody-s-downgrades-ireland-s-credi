German government bonds rose after
Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Ireland’s credit ranking,
boosting demand for assets perceived to be safer.  The yield on the 10-year bund fell five basis points to
3.01 percent as of 7:17 a.m. in London. The two-year note yield
was little changed at 1.06 percent.  Moody’s said today in a statement that it cut Ireland’s
ranking to Baa1 from Aa2, with a negative outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
