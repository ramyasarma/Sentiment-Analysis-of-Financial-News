Oil traded near its highest price in
10 days after an unexpected decline in U.S. claims for jobless
benefits and gains in housing starts bolstered the economic
outlook for the world’s largest crude user.  Crude for January delivery increased as much as 67 cents to
$88.37 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract, which expires Dec. 20 and reached a two-
year high of $90.76 on Dec. 7, was at $87.79 at 11:02 a.m.
London time. Brent crude for February settlement was up 23 cents
at $91.83 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
