Dongfang Electric Corp. , China’s
third-largest power equipment maker, said it received 20.4
billion yuan ($3.06 billion) of orders for thermal-, wind- and
nuclear-power generating equipment from India and China.  Abhijeet Projects Ltd. will buy 10 sets of 660 megawatt
"supercritical" coal-burning units for about $2.5 billion,
Dongfang said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday.
The order, signed Dec. 15, is the company’s largest from India.  Chinese companies signed $16 billion of deals with Indian
counterparts during Premier  Wen Jiabao ’s visit this week.
Commerce Ministry official  Liang Wentao  told reporters in
Beijing on Dec. 13 that the agreements also include an $8.3
billion sale of coal-fired power generators by  Shanghai Electric
Group Co. , Dongfang’s largest rival, to  Reliance Power Ltd .  Dongfang signed a contract on Nov. 12 to supply 166 units
of 1.5 megawatts of direct-drive wind-power equipment to India’s
KSK Ltd. for about $203 million, according to the statement. On
Nov. 4, it agreed to sell steam-turbine generating sets to CPI
Jiangxi Nuclear Power Co. and China Power Project Equipment Co.
for 2.4 billion yuan.  In total, the three orders are equivalent to 61 percent of
revenue in 2009, Dongfang said. In the first nine months of
2010, Dongfang’s sales were 26 billion yuan, a 14 percent
increase from a year earlier, according to an Oct. 29 filing.  The stock fell 1 percent to HK$34.15 in Hong Kong trading
yesterday, cutting its gain this year to 64 percent. The
benchmark Hang Seng Index has  advanced  3.9 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
