Sara Lee Corp.  rose 5.3%, the most 
in two months, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the 
maker of Jimmy Dean breakfast foods and Ball Park hotdogs may 
sell itself to Brazilian meat processor JBS SA.  JBS , the world’s largest meat-processing company, made
overtures to the Downers Grove, Illinois-based company and talks
have been on and off for months, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter. Sara Lee also may
seek to sell its beverage and meat units, the WSJ said.  Sara Lee, whose  sales  surpassed $10 billion last year, is
selling other divisions, such as its North American bakery unit,
to concentrate on the faster-growing coffee and meats
businesses. Interim Chief Executive Officer Marcel Smits has led
the company since Brenda Barnes resigned four months ago to
focus on her health.  Mike Cummins, a spokesman for Sara Lee, didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment. An e-mail to the investor
relations director at Sao Paulo-based JBS wasn’t immediately
returned.  Sara Lee rose 87 cents to $17.26 at 4 p.m. in New York 
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The gain was the most since 
Oct. 4. JBS rose 1.5 percent to 7 reais.  Based on today’s trading, Sara Lee had a market value of
about $11 billion. The company attracted interest from buyout
firms including Apollo Global Management LLC and KKR & Co. this
year, people with knowledge of the matter said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
