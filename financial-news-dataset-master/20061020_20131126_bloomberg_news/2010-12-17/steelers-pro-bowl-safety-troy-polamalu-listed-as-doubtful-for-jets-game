Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Bowl safety
 Troy Polamalu  is listed as doubtful for the Dec. 19 game against
the New York Jets due to a lower-leg injury.  Polamalu, 29, did not practice this week and his status
will be a game-time decision, team spokesman  Dave Lockett  said
in a telephone interview. Polamalu originally injured the ankle
last month and aggravated the injury on Dec. 12 against the
Cincinnati Bengals.  Polamalu, the American Football Conference Defensive Player
of the Week for the past two weeks, has six interceptions and 62
tackles this season. In the Steelers’ 23-7 win over the Bengals
on Dec. 12, Polamalu had two interceptions -- one returned for a
touchdown and a second in the Pittsburgh end zone with just over
two minutes remaining.  The 10-3 Steelers are in first place in the AFC North and
can clinch a playoff spot with a win or a tie against the 9-4
Jets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
