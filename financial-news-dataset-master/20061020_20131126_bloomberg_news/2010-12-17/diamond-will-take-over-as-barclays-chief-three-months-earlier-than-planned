Barclays Plc,  Britain’s third-
biggest bank, said  Robert Diamond  will take over as chief
executive officer three months earlier than planned.  Diamond, 59, will become CEO on Jan. 1, the London-based
bank said in a statement today. Barclays said in September
Diamond would succeed  John Varley  as CEO on March 31, 2011.  “We are now ready to effect the hand-over,” Chairman
 Marcus Agius  said in the statement. “The speed with which the
transition has been completed reflects the continuity in
management and strategy that the succession provides.”  Massachusetts-born Diamond has led Barclays’s investment-
banking expansion, including the 2008 purchase of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s U.S. operations. His Barclays Capital
unit accounted for 66 percent of the lender’s pretax profit in
the first half, up from half last year.  Varley, 54, will advise Barclays on regulatory matters
until Sept. 30, 2011, the company said. He is the frontrunner to
succeed  John Bond  as chairman of mobile phone operator Vodafone
Group Plc, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported Dec. 6.  A Barclays spokesman declined to comment beyond the
statement. The shares dropped 1.3 percent to 260 pence as of
12:09 p.m. in London.  Barclays  is among U.K. banks that are being questioned by
the government-sponsored Independent Commission on Banking,
which is assessing whether to recommend breaking up lenders to
increase financial stability and competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
