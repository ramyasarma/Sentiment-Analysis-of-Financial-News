General Motors Co. ’s South Korean
unit will post its first annual profit since 2007 helped by
surging exports to Eastern Europe and other emerging markets.  “GM Daewoo had a very profitable year,”  Mike Arcamone ,
chief executive officer of  GM Daewoo Auto & Technology Co. , told
reporters at the company year-end party in Seoul late yesterday,
without elaboration.  The automaker will likely boost vehicle shipments,
including unassembled cars, 17 percent this year to more than
1.8 million, Arcamone said, helped by demand for Chevrolet Cruze
compacts, Spark minicars and Alpheon sedans. The Incheon, South
Korea-based unit made losses in 2008 and 2009 because of wrong-
way bets on currency hedging and slower sales amid the global
recession.  GM Daewoo plans to roll out seven new models by the end of
next year and to start selling Chevrolet cars in South Korea in
2011, Arcamone said. The CEO, appointed a year ago to turn
around the money-losing unit, has set a goal of increasing its
market share in South Korea to more than 10 percent this year.  Excluding exports of unassembled vehicles, GM Daewoo
expects to sell more than 750,000 vehicles this year, Arcamone
said. The automaker sold 680,305 vehicles in the first 11 months,
33 percent more than a year earlier, according to a statement.  GM owns a 70 percent stake in the South Korean unit, while
 Suzuki Motor Corp.  holds 6.8 percent and  SAIC Motor Corp. , GM’s
China partner, has 6 percent. Korea Development Bank, GM
Daewoo’s main creditor, owns the remaining 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
