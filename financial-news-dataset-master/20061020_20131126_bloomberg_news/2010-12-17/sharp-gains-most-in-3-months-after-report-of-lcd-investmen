Sharp Corp. gained the most in three
months in Tokyo trading after a report said the Japanese
electronics maker would spend 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion)
on a liquid-crystal display production line to supply screens
mainly for Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  The stock rose 2.9 percent to 852 yen as of 9:26 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, headed for the biggest gain since
Sept. 15. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average was little
changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
