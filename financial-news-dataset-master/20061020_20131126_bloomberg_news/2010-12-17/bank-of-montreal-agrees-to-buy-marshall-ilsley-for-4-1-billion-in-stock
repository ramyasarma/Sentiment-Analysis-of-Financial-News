Bank of Montreal , Canada’s fourth-
biggest bank by assets, agreed to buy Wisconsin’s  Marshall &
Ilsley Corp.  for $4.1 billion to expand in the U.S.  The deal values Marshall & Ilsley at $7.75 a share,
compared with yesterday’s closing price of $5.79 on the New York
Stock Exchange, Toronto-based BMO said today in a statement.  Canadian banks, ranked the world’s soundest for three
straight years by the World Economic Forum, have been expanding
in the U.S., where companies faltered as the real-estate market
tumbled. Milwaukee-based Marshall & Ilsley has posted eight
straight quarterly losses while Bank of Montreal has reported
six consecutive quarters of profit growth, a streak unmatched by
Canada’s five other large lenders.  The acquisition “transforms BMO’s competitive position in
the U.S.,” said  Bill Downe , chief executive officer of BMO
Financial Group. “It also increases scale and provides strong
entry into other attractive markets, including Minnesota,
Missouri, and Kansas, and expansion in Indiana and Wisconsin.”  Bank of Montreal plans to raise about C$800 million ($794
million) in common equity prior to the completion of the deal
and purchase preferred shares that the U.S. Treasury acquired
when it rescued Marshall & Ilsley. The deal is expected to be
completed by the end of July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
