U.K. consumer confidence fell to a
20-month low in November as the looming government budget
squeeze dented Britons’ outlook for 2011, Nationwide Building
Society said.  The  index of sentiment  slipped 7 points from October to 45,
the lowest since March 2009, the customer-owned lender said in
an e-mailed report today. The gauge has now fallen for three
consecutive months. The measure of consumers’ future
expectations fell 9 points to 61, also a 20-month low.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s drive to tackle the record
 budget deficit  with the deepest spending cuts since World War II
threatens to slow economic growth. The squeeze will eliminate
330,000 public-sector jobs and increase sales tax to 20 percent
next year from its current level of 17.5 percent.  “The strong rally in sentiment that took place from the
middle of 2009 into the first quarter of this year has now been
almost completely reversed,”  Martin Gahbauer , chief economist
at Swindon, England-based Nationwide, said in a statement. “The
fall in confidence can largely be attributed to consumers
growing increasingly cautious over the outlook.”  An index of people’s current perception of the economy
dropped 5 points to 21, while a gauge of whether now is a good
time to spend slumped 13 points to 79, the report showed.
TNS-RI questioned 1,000 people for Nationwide between Oct. 18
and Nov. 21. GfK NOP Ltd.’s consumer-confidence index fell in
November to a four-month low, according to a Nov. 30 report.  Sentiment Lag  Weakening sentiment is “not uncommon in the early stages
of a recovery” as improvements in the labor market often lag
turnarounds in the wider economy, Gahbauer said.  While  jobless claims  fell in November, unemployment
measured by International Labour Organization methods rose by
35,000 to 2.5 million people in the quarter through October.  The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said
in a separate report that fewer British employees expect a pay
raise next year as government workers grow more pessimistic
about the future. Fifty-eight percent of the 3,000 respondents
in a survey said they anticipate a wage increase in 2011,
compared with a result of 67 percent last year, CIPD said.  Meanwhile, a gauge of U.K. residential rents was little
changed in November as increases in London offset declines in
other areas of England. The average monthly rent for a home in
England and Wales was 692 pounds ($1,079) last month, compared
with 691 pounds in October, the Newcastle, England-based  company 
said today. While London posted a 1.8 percent gain, rents fell
by 3.1 percent in eastern England and 2.4 percent in the East
Midlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
