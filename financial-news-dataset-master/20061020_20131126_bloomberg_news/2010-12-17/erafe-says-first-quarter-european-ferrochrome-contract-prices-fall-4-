Merafe Resources Ltd. , part owner of
the world’s biggest ferrochrome producer, said first-quarter
European ferrochrome contract prices have been settled at $1.25
a pound, 4 percent below the previous quarter.  European benchmark prices for the metal, which is used to
prevent corrosion of stainless steel, are negotiated quarterly
between the largest producers and their biggest customers. Spot
prices for ferrochrome reached a high of $2.85 a pound in the
European Union in May 2008, according to Metal Bulletin.  UBS AG is forecasting a 12 percent increase in ferrochrome
prices next year, analyst  Fawzi Hanano  wrote in a note today.
Prices may average about $1.39 a pound next year, up from $1.24
in 2010, he wrote.  Increasing costs for companies in South Africa, the world’s
largest producer, may push prices higher in the second and third
quarters, Hanano wrote.  Stuart Elliot , Merafe’s chief executive officer, wasn’t
immediately available when Bloomberg News called his office
seeking comment. Merafe owns 20.5 percent of the Xstrata-Merafe
Chrome Venture along with Xstrata Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
