General Motors said on its website
that it is recalling 111,136 Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain and
Cadillac SRX 2011 model year crossovers because of seat belt
buckle anchors that could fail to perform as designed in a
crash.  The company said no injuries are known to have resulted
from the flaw, which may contribute to the malfunction of the
seat belt system if the buckle is rotated in a certain way and
is subject to peak loads during a crash.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
