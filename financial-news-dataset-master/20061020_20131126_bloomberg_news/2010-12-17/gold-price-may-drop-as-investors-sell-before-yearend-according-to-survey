Gold may decline as some investors
sell the metal before the end of the year to take advantage of a
10th consecutive annual gain, a survey found.  Twelve of 24 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 50 percent, said the metal will fall next week.
Eight predicted higher prices and four were neutral. Gold
futures for February delivery were down 1.3 percent for this
week at $1,366.40 an ounce at 10:45 a.m. yesterday on the Comex
in New York.  Bullion climbed 25 percent this year as investors sought a
protection of wealth from debt woes in Europe and as governments
and central banks pumped money into the financial system to prop
up economies. Gold futures declined for the first week in three
last week after advancing to a record $1,432.50 on Dec. 7.  “The market seems more than willing to take profit in
rallies rather than chase the price higher,” said  Walter de Wet , an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in London. “Scrap and
other selling are outpacing buying interest.”  The attached chart tracks the results of the Bloomberg
survey, with the red bars derived by subtracting bearish
forecasts from bullish estimates. Readings below zero signal
that most respondents expect a decline. The green line shows the
gold price. The data are as of Dec. 10.  The weekly gold survey that started six years ago has
forecast prices accurately in 195 of 341 weeks, or 57 percent of
the time.  This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 8  Bearish : 12  Neutral : 4  To contact the reporter on this story:
