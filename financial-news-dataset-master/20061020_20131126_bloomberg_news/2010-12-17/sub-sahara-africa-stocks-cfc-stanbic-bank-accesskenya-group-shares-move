50 cents, or 3.6 percent, to 13.55 shillings in Nairobi. The

the previous year because of depreciation and foreign-exchange
losses, it said in a statement to the Nairobi Stock Exchange.  Fan Milk Ltd.  (FML GN), a Ghanaian maker of yogurt and ice

export. The shares gained 11 pesewas, or 4.1 percent, to 2.77
cedis in Accra.  United Bank for Africa Plc  (UBA NL), Nigeria’s fourth-
