Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said WikiLeaks.org hasn’t broken any of the nation’s
laws by releasing the U.S. cables and police have found no
grounds for an investigation.  “The advice is there have been no breaches of Australian
law,” Gillard told reporters in Sydney today. “It is clear the
theft of those documents is an illegal act but that’s in the
hands of U.S. authorities.”  WikiLeaks founder and Australian  Julian Assange , 39, was
released from a London prison on bail yesterday. He turned
himself in to the U.K. authorities on Dec. 7 after Swedish
police issued a warrant on one count of unlawful coercion, two
counts of sexual molestation and one count of rape.  WikiLeaks has drawn condemnation for posting thousands of
classified U.S. diplomatic communications and U.S. military
documents, including a video of a July 2007 helicopter attack in
Iraq that killed a Reuters television cameraman and his driver.  “I know there are a number of people who are fans of
WikiLeaks,” Gillard said. “Let me make it very very clear, I
am not.”  Assange is entitled to Australian consular assistance,
Gillard said.  Assange was released after being ordered to post bail of
200,000 pounds ($312,700), turn in his passport, wear an
electronic tag and observe an overnight curfew at a friend’s
home. At least nine of Assange’s friends and supporters agreed
to offer a total of 75,000 pounds of additional guarantees for
the bail, bringing the total commitment to 275,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
