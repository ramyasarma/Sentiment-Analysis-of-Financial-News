Canada’s budget  deficit  widened
C$4.11 billion ($4.06 billion) in October because of a decline
in revenue from corporate and sales taxes.  Canada’s deficit widened from C$3.3 billion in October last
year, according to a statement released today by the finance
department. For the April-October period, the cumulative deficit
narrowed to C$21.5 billion from C$31.9 billion a year earlier.
Canada’s fiscal year begins April 1.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  projects a C$45.4 billion
deficit for the current fiscal year, down from a record C$55.6
billion in the 12 months that ended March 31.  Corporate tax revenue fell 11.4 percent in October to
C$1.48 billion, and revenue from the federal sales tax dropped
9.3 percent to C$1.9 billion, the finance department said. Total
tax revenue increased 0.9 percent to C$14.6 billion, on a 5.6
percent gain in revenue from personal income taxes.  Program spending by the government rose to C$19.2 billion
in the month from C$18.4 billion a year earlier, the report
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
