Deutsche Lufthansa AG said some
flights will be delayed or cancelled today as a result of heavy
snowfall overnight across Germany, hampering travel.  Flights departing from Frankfurt Airport were reduced to
five an hour last night, compared with 43 under normal weather
conditions, spokeswoman Karin Weber said by phone today. The
snowfall has since stopped in Frankfurt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
