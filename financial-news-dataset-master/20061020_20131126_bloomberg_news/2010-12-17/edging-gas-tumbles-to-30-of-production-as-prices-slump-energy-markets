Natural gas companies are slashing
their hedging of future output as prices tumble, raising the
prospect of declines in drilling and production.  About 30 percent of next year’s gas has been hedged, down
from approximately 50 percent this year, according to analysts
at Canaccord Genuity, RBC Capital Markets and Raymond James. Gas
fell 27 percent so far in 2010 and settled at $4.066 per million
British thermal units this week on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the lowest level in nine years for this time of year.  Southwestern Energy Co. , the largest gas producer in the
Fayetteville shale of Arkansas, has so far sold a lower
percentage of futures and swaps for 2011 production than for
2010. The drop in the availability of insurance suggests
speculators don’t expect an increase in gas next year and leaves
companies vulnerable to price fluctuations.  “If producers are not able to hedge at attractive levels,
they will be selling more gas at spot prices, and if spot prices
remain depressed, that will leave less capital for drilling in
the following year,” said  Biliana Pehlivanova , an analyst at
Barclays Capital in New York.  Benchmark gas at the Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, will
average $4.33 per million Btu next year, down from this year’s
estimated average of $4.37, according to a U.S. Energy
Department report on Dec. 7. Prices have declined as increasing
production of shale gas, which is extracted from onshore rock
formations, boosted stockpiles to a record 3.843 trillion cubic
feet for the week ended Nov. 12.  2010 Forecast  Output will average 62.09 billion cubic feet a day this
year, the highest level ever, according to the Energy
Department. The number of U.S. gas drilling rigs fell by 13 to
948 in the week ended Dec. 10, according to Baker Hughes Inc.
The rig total is up 25 percent from a year ago.  Producers have hedged about 32 percent of 2011 production
at an average price of $5.80 per million Btu, down from 52
percent at $6.50 for 2010, said  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst in
Houston at Canaccord Genuity.  “Lower levels of hedging force producers to set their
budgets based on returns that are more commensurate with the
current gas price environment,” Horwitz said.  Gas producers’  net-short positions  in futures and options
combined in four gas contracts declined to 485,180 futures
equivalents in the week of Dec. 7, down 24 percent from a peak
in May and the lowest level this year, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders
report released Dec. 10. Producers sell futures to secure prices
for output from their wells.  Four Contracts  The measure of natural-gas positions includes an index of
four contracts adjusted to futures equivalents: Nymex natural
gas futures, Nymex Henry Hub Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate
Swaps, and ICE Henry Hub Swaps.  Houston-based Southwestern Energy has about 129 billion
cubic feet, or 27 percent, of its 2011 expected gas production
hedged at an average price of $5.43 per million Btu, compared
with 121.2 billion, or 30 percent, for 2010, the company said
yesterday in a statement. The company sold forward about 40
billion cubic feet of the fuel at $5 in the past month.  The company also said it will reduce capital investment to
$1.9 billion for 2011 from $2.1 billion in 2010.  The 2011 gas calendar strip , or the average price of 12
months of futures contracts, was $4.2909 per million Btu at 3:45
p.m. in New York, down from $6.3361 at the beginning of the
year.  Selling Forward  Gas companies are reluctant to sell forward with prices so
low and are “entering 2011 with less downside protection to
weaker gas prices,” analysts including  Marshall Adkins  at St.
Petersburg, Florida-based Raymond James said in a report on Dec.
6. Producers have covered 34 percent of 2011 output, compared
with 50 percent in 2010, according to the firm’s analysis of 41
companies.  Scott Hanold , an analyst with RBC Capital Markets in
Minneapolis, says producers have sold forward about 35 percent
of their 2011 output, down from about 50 percent for 2010.  Cimarex Energy Co., a Denver-based independent oil and gas
company, said it hasn’t sold forward at all.  “In terms of gas for 2011, you can basically think of us
as unhedged for next year,”  Paul Korus , chief financial officer
of Cimarex, said in a presentation on Nov. 18.  EOG Resources Inc. , a Houston-based gas producer, said it
has about 150 million cubic feet per day of 2011’s output hedged
at $5.44, down from 646 million hedged for 2009.  “We are not well hedged at this point for 2011,” said
 Loren Leiker , vice president of EOG, at a presentation on Nov.
11. The company is “hoping for a better opportunity to ratchet
that number up.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
