Southern Sudan is likely to vote to
secede from Sudan in a referendum next month, said  Nafie Ali Nafie , an aide to President  Umar al-Bashir .  Efforts to maintain the unity of Sudan have failed, Nafie
said yesterday, according to state news agency  SUNA . The
government of the north will have to accept a vote in favor of
separation, the Khartoum-based agency cited him as saying in a
speech.  The referendum, scheduled for Jan. 9, is the centerpiece of
a 2005  peace agreement  that ended a 21-year civil war between
the Muslim north and the oil-producing south, where Christianity
and traditional beliefs dominate. About 2 million people died in
the conflict and 4 million fled their homes.  Al-Bashir’s government has urged voters in the south to opt
to remain part of Sudan. Southern Sudan is now a semi-autonomous
region governed by the former rebels of the  Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement .  Southern Sudan accounts for as much as 80 percent of
Sudan’s 490,000 barrels of daily oil production. Sudan is sub-
Saharan Africa’s third-largest producer, according to the  BP
Statistical Review of World Energy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
