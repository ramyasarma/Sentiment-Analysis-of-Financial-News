Total SA , Europe’s third-biggest oil
producer, bought stakes in oil sands developments in Alberta
from Suncor Energy Inc. for C$1.75 billion ($1.74 billion).  Under the deal, Total will acquire a 19.2 percent stake in
Suncor’s Fort Hills project and will also buy a 49 percent stake
in the Suncor-operated Voyageur upgrader development near Fort
McMurray. In return, Suncor will take 36.75 percent of the
French company’s interest in Joslyn, according to a statement.  The two companies agreed to develop Fort Hills and Voyageur
“in parallel” so that they come on stream in early 2016, Total
said. Production from the Joslyn North mine of 100,000 barrels a
day will start in 2017 or 2018.  Plans to start extracting oil at Alberta’s Joslyn Creek,
where oil-soaked rocks and dirt will be mined near the surface,
have sparked scrutiny from regulators and the ire of
environmental groups such as  Greenpeace . Regulators have yet to
approve the agreement, Total said.  Total had planned to produce as much as 250,000 barrels a
day from its Canadian oil sands projects by 2020, buoyed by the
purchase of  UTS Energy Corp.   The purchase of Calgary-based UTS, which was announced in
July, will give Total a 20 percent stake in the Fort Hills
mining project, also in the Athabasca region of Alberta. The
open-pit mine contains about 3.4 billion barrels of bitumen and
is estimated to produce about 160,000 barrels a day by 2016. The
project is 60 percent-owned by Suncor, and the remaining 20
percent is held by Teck Resources Inc.  Alberta’s oil sands contain the biggest crude reserves
outside of Saudi Arabia, according to Canadian government
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
