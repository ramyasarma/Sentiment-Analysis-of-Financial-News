Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co ., the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips, said it
fired a technical manager who was charged in the U.S. for
conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud.  The company terminated its employment of Manosha
Karunatilaka on Dec. 16, the day of his indictment, the Hsinchu-
based chipmaker said in an e-mailed statement today. TSMC will
continue to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors, according to the
statement.  Karunatilaka was one of three technology company workers
arrested in the U.S. yesterday on charges of wire fraud,
conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit
wire fraud as federal prosecutors expanded a probe of insider
trading to companies.  Karunatilaka received bail of $300,000 in Boston federal
court, his lawyer, Brad Bailey, said.  Calls made after office hours to the Boston office of
Karunatilaka’s lawyer were directed to an answering service.
 Elizabeth Sun , a spokeswoman for TSMC, said she doesn’t have
contact details for Karunatilaka.  To contact the reporter on this story:
