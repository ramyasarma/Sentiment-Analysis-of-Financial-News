European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Axel Weber  said euro bonds wouldn’t improve
confidence in euro-region member states’ finances.  “The increased discussion about issuing euro bonds has to
be seen very critically” because they “undermine fiscal self-
responsibility and wouldn’t really strengthen confidence,”
Weber said in a speech in Munich today. “For a sustainable
solution of the current crisis, the already existing instrument
of the European rescue fund is much better suited.”  German and French policy makers have dismissed calls to
issue joint euro-region government bonds. ECB President  Jean- Claude Trichet  this week signaled he shares this position.  To contact the reporters on this story:
