PetroChina Co. will “bear the
brunt” of a resource tax that is being expanded to 12 western
provinces, reducing the largest Chinese oil company’s 2011
earnings by 2.5 percent, according to China International
Capital Corp.  The effect on PetroChina’s earnings may reach 5.5 percent
if the reform is implemented nationwide, Bin Guan, a CICC
analyst, wrote in a report dated yesterday. China started
levying a 5 percent tax on oil and gas exploration in 12 western
provinces starting Dec. 1, Inner Mongolia Daily reported
yesterday, citing a joint statement from the country’s finance
ministry and taxation bureau. PetroChina declined 1.6 percent to
11.50 yuan as of 11:30 a.m. in Shanghai trading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
