Ingenico SA , the world’s largest
maker of payment terminals, got a 1.44 billion-euro ($1.9
billion) non-binding offer from an undisclosed buyer.  The company said in an e-mailed statement that it received
a 28-euro-per-share takeover offer. The bid is 41 cents a share
more than its last stock price before the shares were suspended
today. Before trading was halted, the  shares rose  as much as
4.24 percent to 27.66 euros.  Discussions “may or may not lead to a transaction,” said
Ingenico, based in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine.  Payment software and equipment are attracting increasing
interest from technology and telecommunications companies as
more transactions move from cash to electronic formats.  France
Telecom SA , the largest French telecom company, yesterday
announced a research effort aimed at improving technologies for
payment using mobile phones.  The global value of goods purchased via mobile devices will
represent about $200 billion annually in 2012, according to
Juniper Research.  Ingenico will issue a further statement before the start of
trading in Paris on Dec. 20, following a board meeting, the
company said.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
