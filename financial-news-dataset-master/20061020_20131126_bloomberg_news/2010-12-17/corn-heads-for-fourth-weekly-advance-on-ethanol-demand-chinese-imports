Wheat fell for the second straight
day on speculation that dry weather in parts of Australia will
allow farmers to resume a harvest that’s six weeks late.  Less rain is expected in growing areas of eastern
Australia, allowing fieldwork to continue, Accuweather.com said
in a report. Rain expected in parts of New South Wales and
Queensland that will further delay collection may end next week,
allowing farmers back into fields, Accuweather said. Wheat has
gained 8.2 percent this month because of the Australian rains.  “Australia has seen a reprieve from heavy rainfall this
week which has eased fear in the market,” said  Alexander Bos ,
an analyst with Macquarie Bank in London. “The story may not be
over yet, with more rain in the forecast for the weekend
particularly across NSW and Queensland. Many farmers may not get
back to the harvest until after Christmas.”  Wheat for March delivery fell 2.75 cents, or 0.4 percent,
