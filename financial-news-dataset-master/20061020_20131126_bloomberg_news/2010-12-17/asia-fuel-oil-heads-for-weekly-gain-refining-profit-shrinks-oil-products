Asia fuel oil swaps recovered from
last week’s drop as benchmark crude futures rose above $88 a
barrel. Gasoil and naphtha crack spreads, which measure refining
profit, decreased.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for January slipped 25 cents to
$513.75 a metric ton at 12 p.m. Singapore time, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates, a brokerage. The product is up 1.3
percent this week, reversing last week’s 0.9 percent decline.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude, the Asian benchmark,
widened 58 cents to $10.48 a barrel. Refiners’ losses from
making the residue have worsened 44 percent so far this month.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade increased for a third day, gaining 25 cents to $10.50 a
ton, PVM said. This  viscosity spread  has widened 31 percent in
December, showing bunker, or marine fuel, prices have lagged
behind gains in higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  January swaps for  gasoil , or diesel, rose 35 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $102.75 a barrel, according to PVM. The product is
little changed this week, compared with a 0.6 percent gain in
benchmark crude futures in New York.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude dropped 19 cents to $13.23
a barrel, the lowest this month, PVM said. This  crack spread  has
fallen 14 percent from Dec. 7 when it was $15.43, the widest
since January 2009.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil added 5 cents to $1.20 a
barrel, based on PVM data. This  regrade  is down 27 percent since
the end of November, signaling it’s less profitable to produce
aviation fuel compared with diesel.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for second-half January delivery were bid at $857.25 a
ton against offers at $860.25, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. That’s up from yesterday’s close of
$850, indicating prices may post a fourth weekly increase.  Naphtha’s crack spread to Brent crude declined $1.36 to
$157.70 a ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
difference has narrowed about 8 percent in December.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday rebounded 35 cents
to $7.15 a barrel, Bloomberg calculations showed. This  reforming
margin  has climbed 52 percent from the end of November, meaning
motor fuel is more profitable to produce compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
