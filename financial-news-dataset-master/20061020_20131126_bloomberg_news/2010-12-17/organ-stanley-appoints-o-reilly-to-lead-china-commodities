Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, appointed  Kevin O’Reilly  to lead its China
commodities business from early next year.  O’Reilly, a managing director based in Purchase, New York,
most recently ran the bank’s commodities hedge-fund business,
Noel Cheung, a spokeswoman in Hong Kong, said in an e-mailed
reply to Bloomberg News today. O’Reilly will report to  Harry Soh ,
Asia head of commodities, and be based in Shanghai, she said.  Banks are expanding their commodities businesses in Asia,
where demand from China has boosted demand for copper, steel,
grains, gold and coal. Barclays Capital said in September it
moved London-based  James Groves  to Singapore to lead its Asian
commodity team, the first head of the region for the bank.  The Chinese economy will expand 9 percent next year and
help drive global growth, Morgan Stanley analysts led by New
York-based  Hussein Allidina  said in a Dec. 10 report. “We see
most commodity prices moving higher in 2011 as global gross
domestic product, at an above-trend 4.2 percent, bolsters
demand,” the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
