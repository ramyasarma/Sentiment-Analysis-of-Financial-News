South Africa’s Congress of the
People, the third-largest political party, may not have its
elective conference for a second time this year because of
fighting and allegations of irregularities, Business Day
reported, citing an unidentified party official.  Should COPE not hold elections, a call for a split between
rival groups may gain momentum, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said. The conference was meant to start on Dec. 15. A meeting in
May broke down because of fighting between supporters of  Mosiuoa Lekota , the party’s president and  Mbhazima Shilowa , its deputy
president, Business Day said, citing the official.  To contact the reporters on this story:
