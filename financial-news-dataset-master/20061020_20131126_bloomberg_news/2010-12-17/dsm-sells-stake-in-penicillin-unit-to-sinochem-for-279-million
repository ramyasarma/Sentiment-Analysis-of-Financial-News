Royal DSM NV, the world’s biggest
vitamin maker, sold a 50 percent stake in its penicillin
operation to Sinochem Group for 210 million euros ($279
million), ending a six year search for a partner.  The Dutch company will book a one-time gain of 55 million
euros in the fourth quarter, the Heerlen-based company said in a
statement.  DSM aims to unlock sales in one of the world’s fastest-
growing markets. That will help it meet a 2015 margin  target  of
15 percent to 20 percent at the Pharma division, whose two
clusters make penicillin and drug ingredients. Last year, North
China Pharmaceutical Group abandoned a planned venture with DSM.  “In DSM Pharmaceutical Products, partnerships can also
play an important role,” Chief Executive Officer  Feike Sijbesma 
told journalists on a conference call today. After forming the
Sinochem venture, Sijbesma said he may seek Asian partnerships
for the pharma products unit at a later stage.  DSM jumped 3.3 percent to 41.06 euros as of 11:11 a.m. in
Amsterdam, the steepest gain in more than three months. That
values the company, founded in 1902 as Dutch State Mines, at 7.8
billion euros.  The anti-infectives business is part of DSM’s
pharmaceutical unit, which posted a third-quarter operating loss
of 6 million euros on 168 million euros of sales. The unit
accounted for 7.7 percent of revenue at DSM.  “The forming of this global joint venture is momentous for
Sinochem with respect to its effort to build up its presence in
the biotech industry,” Sinochem Vice-President  Pan Zhengyi  said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
