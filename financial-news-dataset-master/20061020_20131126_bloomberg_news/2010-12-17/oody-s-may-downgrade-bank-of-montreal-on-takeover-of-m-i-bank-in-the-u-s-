Bank of Montreal ’s credit rating may
be downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service because of
“integration challenges” from a $4.1 billion takeover of
Milwaukee-based  Marshall & Ilsley Corp .  Moody’s placed the long-term Aa2 rating of Canada’s fourth-
biggest bank and ratings for its subsidiaries on review for
downgrade, the rating company said today in a statement. Bank of
Montreal’s short-term Prime-1 ratings were affirmed.  “The transaction is transformative for BMO’s U.S.
operations, and will present the firm with integration
challenges,” Moody’s said in the statement.  Bank of Montreal agreed to pay 0.1257 of its own share for
each share of Marshall & Ilsley to expand its Chicago-based
Harris Bank, the Toronto-based lender said today. The deal will
double Bank of Montreal’s U.S. deposits and branches as it
expands in the Midwest.  “These merger execution challenges are compounded by the
fact that M&I has significant asset quality issues, and BMO’s
existing U.S. operations have underperformed and have not been
consistently profitable in recent years,” Moody’s said.  DBRS Ltd., the Toronto-based rating company, today
confirmed the bank’s AA rating, and said all trends are stable.  “The confirmation of BMO’s ratings and trends reflects
DBRS’s belief that the acquisition is a good strategic and
geographic fit for Harris Bankcorp Inc. and BMO’s sizable
domestic franchise,” the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
