The euro may encounter a "big move"
against the dollar at the beginning of 2011 based on ichimoku
chart analysis, according to Mizuho Securities Co.  An ichimoku chart shows the first and second span lines are
converging, compressing the so-called cloud at around the $1.36
euro per dollar level on around Dec. 31, said  Kengo Suzuki , a
currency analyst at the unit of Japan’s second-largest bank. The
cloud refers to the area between the two span lines.  “It’s said that a big move tends to occur around a twist
of an ichimoku cloud,” Suzuki said. “The euro may largely stay
in the range of between $1.30 and 1.34 before starting such a
change at the beginning of next year.”  The ichimoku theory doesn’t say which direction such a big
move will take, Suzuki said, though an easing of tensions
relating to the European debt crisis may help the euro to
strengthen.  The common currency was little changed at $1.3247 as of
9:19 a.m. in Tokyo. The euro has averaged $1.3295 this week,
with a high of $1.3499 on Dec. 14 and a low of $1.3181
yesterday.  Ichimoku analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist in
the 1940s, is used to predict a currency’s direction by
analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows. The cloud
refers to the area between the first and second leading-span
lines on the ichimoku chart and is used to show an area where
buy orders may be clustered.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
