Debswana Diamond Co., a joint
venture between De Beers and the Botswana government, named  Jim Gowans  as managing director as it undertakes a 24 billion-pula
($3.65 billion) expansion of the country’s biggest diamond mine.  Gowans, who takes up the post in January, is currently
chief operating officer and technical officer of De Beers and
before that was chief executive officer of the miner’s Canadian
unit, the London-based company said on its  website  today.  Botswana is the world’s largest diamond producer,
accounting for about a fifth of global output. Gem production in
the country is recovering after slumping last year when the
global financial crisis slashed demand and led to the temporary
closure of some mines.  Debswana, which produced about 72 percent of De Beers’
annual production last year, is extending the life of the
Jwaneng mine, 160 kilometers (99 miles) southwest of the
capital, Gaborone, until 2024 from a previous estimate of 2017,
President  Ian Khama  said on Dec. 10. An additional 102 million
carats of diamonds are expected to be produced by the extension.  Botswana may produce 24 million carats in 2010, 36 percent
more than in 2009, Kgomotso Abi, director of mining at the
Department of Mines, said in July. A carat is equal to a fifth
of a gram.  To contact the reporters on this story:
