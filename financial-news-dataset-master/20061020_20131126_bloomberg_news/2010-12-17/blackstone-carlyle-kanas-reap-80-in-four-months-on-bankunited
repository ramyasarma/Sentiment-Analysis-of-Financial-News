Blackstone Group LP , the Carlyle
Group and other private-equity investors in BankUnited Inc., the
Florida lender seized by regulators last year, reaped an 80
percent return in the first four months they owned the bank.  BankUnited, sold to the buyout group for $900 million in
May 2009, pegged its worth at $1.62 billion as of Sept. 30,
2009, based on figures the Miami Lakes-based company included in
a regulatory filing yesterday as part of its plan to go public.
Chief Executive Officer  John Kanas  contributed $23 million to
original buyout.  BankUnited, which collapsed after three straight quarterly
losses on mortgages, surged in value after the buyout when the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. agreed to reimburse the bank for
80 percent of losses up to $4 billion and 95 percent of any
costs above that amount. The FDIC estimated the failure would
cost its insurance fund $4.9 billion.  The buyout team is being compensated for the risk it’s
taking, said  Ralph “Chip” MacDonald , an Atlanta-based banking
lawyer at Jones Day. “The BankUnited investors are still on the
hook for about 20 percent of the losses, which could make a huge
dent if they suffer greater losses on assets than they
expected,” MacDonald said.  Representatives for BankUnited, Carlyle and Blackstone
declined to comment.  Kanas’s Gain  Kanas’s stock award was calculated as of Sept. 30, 2009.
His employment agreement gives him 5 percent of any increase in
the lender’s worth, said two people with knowledge of the deal
who declined to be named because the details are private. Kanas
stands to receive $35.8 million in shares, 5 percent of a
roughly $720 million gain in the value of the company. He was
also awarded a salary of $1.38 million for 2009.  Kanas, 64, stands to receive a higher pay package for 2009
than any of the CEOs at the six-largest U.S. banks, assuming
BankUnited can sell shares at the value disclosed in the filing.  Kanas, who ran North Fork Bancorp before selling it to
 Capital One Financial Corp.  in 2006, was joined by WL Ross & Co.
and Centerbridge Capital Partners in buying the bank’s assets
from the FDIC, in addition to Blackstone and Carlyle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
