A 37.5-inch-long replica of the ill-
fated Lusitania, the star lot in an auction of antique toys
collected by the late Malcolm Forbes and his sons, sold for
$194,500 at Sotheby’s in  New York  yesterday, setting a record
for a toy boat at auction.  The publishing magnate bought it in 1983 for $28,600. The
actual Cunard ocean liner was torpedoed by a German U-boat in
1915.  Overall, the sale’s 237 lots, which included toy knights
and the earliest surviving Monopoly game, handmade by its
inventor, Charles Darrow, failed to stir as much excitement as
expected. While the room was packed with dealers and collectors,
they seemed more interested in less-expensive lots. A doll
lighthouse with a presale range of $10,000 to $15,000 went for
$17,500.  A 19th-century toy gunboat made in  Germany  in the 1880s
fetched $134,500, failing to reach its low estimate of $150,000.
The largest boat in the Forbes collection, the 47-inch-long
French battleship “Andre,” was expected to go for as much as
$300,000. It failed to sell.  More fortunate was a German-made 1905 vessel known as the
Plank “King Edward VII” Clockwork Battleship, which sold for
$68,500, above the top estimate of $45,000.  It was bought for a client by Stuart Waldman, a  New York- 
based antique-toy dealer, who said he sold it to a Forbes
representative for $2,250 about 30 years ago.  ‘Buying Picassos’  “This stuff is starting to be recognized but it’s nothing
compared to what it’s going to be in 10 years,” Waldman said.
“This is the equivalent to buying Picasso in the 1970s.”  The Monopoly set, one of the last lots, fetched $146,500
above its high estimate of $80,000. Sotheby’s had estimated
total sales of between $3 million and $5 million. The actual
figure was $2.4 million.  The items were sold by Forbes Media LLC, the company that
publishes Forbes magazine. Part of the Forbes toy collection was
auctioned in 1994. The company has cut staff in recent years
because of a decline in advertising, and it sold its Greenwich
Village headquarters to  New York University  last January.  To contact the reporter of this story:
