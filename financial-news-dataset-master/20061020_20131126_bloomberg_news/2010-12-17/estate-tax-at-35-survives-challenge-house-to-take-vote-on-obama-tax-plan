A proposed 35 percent estate tax
survived a challenge in the U.S. House, which now will vote on
whether to send an $858 billion tax-cut extension plan to
President  Barack Obama  for his signature.  The 233-194 vote went against a proposal by some Democrats
to increase the measure’s estate-tax rate to 45 percent.  The tax-cut plan would extend Bush-era tax reductions for
all income levels through 2012, continue expanded unemployment
benefits and cut payroll taxes by 2 percentage points in 2011.
The Senate passed it 81-19 yesterday.  The Senate-passed bill contains an estate tax sought by
Republicans -- a 35 percent top rate and a $5 million per-person
exemption. The House amendment would have set a 45 percent rate
for 2011 and 2012 with a $3.5 million per-person exemption, the
parameters that were in effect in 2009 before the tax was
repealed for 2010.  Under current law, if Congress doesn’t act, a $1 million
exemption and a 55 percent top rate would go into effect in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
