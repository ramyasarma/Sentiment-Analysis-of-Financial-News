Oil may decline next week on
speculation that the U.S. Energy Department will report an
increase in supplies after the biggest drop in more than eight
years in this week’s data.  Eighteen of 34 analysts, or 53 percent, forecast crude oil
will fall through Dec. 23. Nine respondents, or 26 percent,
predicted prices will rise and seven estimated there would be
little change. Last week, 46 percent of analysts forecast the
market would drop.  Inventories tumbled 9.85 million barrels last week to 346
million, almost quadruple the drop of 2.5 million barrels
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, government figures released
Dec. 15 showed. It was the biggest one-week decline since the
seven days ended Sept. 27, 2002, on a per-barrel basis. Imports
decreased 15 percent to the lowest level since September 2008.  “We see the massive drop in U.S. crude imports reported by
DOE as a blip driven by year-end accounting consideration,”
said  Jinzhong Zhang , commodity strategist with Standard Bank Plc
in London. An increase to $90 earlier this month on the Nymex
was “overdone,” he said.  The stockpile decline in the Energy Department report was
concentrated on the Gulf Coast, where oil companies have a tax
incentive to keep inventories low at the end of the year.
Futures have dropped 3.4 percent from a two-year intraday high
of $90.76 reached on Dec. 7.  Crude oil for January delivery gained 23 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $88.02 a barrel this week on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Futures are up 21 percent from a year ago.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
