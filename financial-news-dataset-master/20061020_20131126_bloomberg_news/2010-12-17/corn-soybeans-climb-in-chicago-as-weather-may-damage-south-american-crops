Corn rose to a five-week high after
a private forecaster cut its estimate for planting next year in
the U.S., the world’s largest grower and exporter. Soybeans also
advanced.  Informa Economics Inc. said farmers will plant corn on
90.755 million acres, less than a November forecast of 93.055
million. Soybeans will be sown on 77.565 million, down from a
record 77.714 million this year, the Memphis-based researcher
said today in a report. Informa said farmers may plant the most
acres of cotton in five years, after prices jumped to a record.  “We are in a battle for acres and the trade wants to build
in a premium” to encourage more planting, said Mike Zuzolo, the
president of Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in
Lafayette, Indiana. “This is an issue that will not be resolved
until the planting season,” which will begin in Texas in
February, Zuzolo said.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 9 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $5.965 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, capping a 3.9 percent gain for the week
that was the fourth straight advance. Earlier, the price reached
$5.99, the highest since Nov. 9.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 10 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $13.105 a bushel in Chicago, up 2.9 percent for the
week.  South America Crops  Price also rose on speculation that adverse weather may
damage crops in Brazil and Argentina, the biggest exporters
after the U.S.  Crop stress from hot, dry weather across Argentina will
increase in the two weeks starting Dec. 19, according to a
report from  World Weather Inc . Southern Brazil will be drier and
warmer, the private forecaster said. Corn prices have jumped 44
percent this year, and soybeans were up 25 percent.  “The market is getting worried about crop stress already
beginning to reduce yields in South America,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment
Co. in Minneapolis. “The rains have been too erratic this year,
and crops are deteriorating.”  Corn gained after the U.S. Congress yesterday passed an
$858 billion tax-cut plan that includes incentives to help buoy
demand for fuel made from crops, Schultz said.  U.S. ethanol  output  touched a record 939,000 barrels a day
in the week ended Dec. 3, Energy Department data show.  “Ethanol demand is going to increase next year,” Schultz
said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
