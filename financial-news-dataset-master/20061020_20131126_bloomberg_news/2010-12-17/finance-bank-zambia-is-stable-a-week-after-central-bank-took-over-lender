Finance Bank Zambia Ltd., the
country’s largest privately owned lender, said its liquidity and
cash positions are “stable” a week after the central bank took
control of the company.  There has been “no significant impact” on operations and
all branches remain open, Leonard Haynes, the lender’s interim
chief executive officer, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Bank of Zambia took over Finance Bank on Dec. 10 “to
protect the interests of depositors and other creditors” and to
“ensure the stability” of the country’s banking industry,
Finance Bank said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
