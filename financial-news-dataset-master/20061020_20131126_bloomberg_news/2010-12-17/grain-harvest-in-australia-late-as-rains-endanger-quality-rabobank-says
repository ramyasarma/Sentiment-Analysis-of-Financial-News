Australia’s harvest of winter crops
including wheat, barley and canola was running four to six weeks
behind normal as continuing rain raised the risk of cuts to
output forecasts, Rabobank said in an e-mailed report today.  Production is forecast at 22.7 million metric tons for this
season and may rise to 25.2 million tons next year amid a
favorable weather outlook from the Bureau of Meteorology and
stored soil moisture from the wet spring, Rabobank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
