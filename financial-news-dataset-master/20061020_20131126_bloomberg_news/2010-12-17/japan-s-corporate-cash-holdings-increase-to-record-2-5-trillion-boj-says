Japanese companies accumulated a
record amount of cash last quarter, funds that have failed to
bolster executives’ sentiment and spur economic growth.  Non-financial companies held 206 trillion yen ($2.5
trillion) in currency and deposits as of Sept. 30, up 5 percent
from a year earlier and the largest amount since quarterly data
began in 1979, the Bank of Japan said in Tokyo today.  A BOJ report this week showed confidence among the nation’s
largest manufacturers worsened for the first time since the end
of the global financial crisis as a strong yen threatened
exporters, the driving force of the economic recovery. Machinery
orders, a leading indicator of business investment, have also
slumped for two months, a sign companies aren’t tapping into
their stockpiles to build new factories.  It was the eighth straight quarter cash holdings increased
at companies. Households’  financial assets  climbed 0.3 percent
to 1,442 trillion yen, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
