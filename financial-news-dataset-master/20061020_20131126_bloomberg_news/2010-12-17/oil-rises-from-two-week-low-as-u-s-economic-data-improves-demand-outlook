Oil rose from the lowest in two
weeks after an unexpected decline in U.S. claims for jobless
benefits and gains in housing starts bolstered the economic
outlook for the world’s largest crude user.  Oil climbed as much as 0.8 percent after the Labor
Department said unemployment-insurance applications dropped to
the lowest in three weeks. The dollar extended losses against
the euro as investors grew more confident that the sovereign-
debt crisis in Europe will be contained. A weaker U.S. currency
enhances the investment appeal of commodities.  “Good economic indicators, or some short covering before
the weekend, may cause crude to go up to $89,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a Tokyo-based commodity derivative sales manager at
Newedge, a brokerage. “A rebound is possible if crude falls to
$87 a barrel.”  Crude for January delivery increased as much as 67 cents to
$88.37 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract, which expires Dec. 20, was at $88.15 at
4:02 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, it fell 1 percent to $87.70,
the lowest settlement since Dec. 1. Futures have gained 0.5
percent this week after losing 1.6 percent last week.  U.S. applications for  jobless-insurance  payments fell to
420,000, the Labor Department said. Economists had projected a
median increase in claims to 425,000, based on a Bloomberg News
survey.  Builders in November began work on more homes for the first
time in three months. Housing starts rose to a 555,000 annual
rate last month, up 3.9 percent from October, Commerce
Department data showed yesterday.  European Leaders  The euro advanced against the greenback for a second day as
European Union leaders agreed to create a mechanism to contain
future debt shocks and the European Central Bank armed itself
with more capital. The 16-nation currency rose as much as 0.6
percent to $1.33927 from $1.3244 in New York yesterday.  “People are saying the economy is picking up, and if that
is the point, it should lead to either higher demand for crude,
or the U.S. dollar trading higher as people get more
confident,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of
Commodity Broking Services in Sydney.  Oil may decline next week on speculation the U.S. Energy
Department will report an increase in supplies after the biggest
drawdown in more than eight years in this week’s data.  Eighteen of 34 analysts and traders, or 53 percent,
forecast crude will fall through Dec. 23. Nine respondents, or
26 percent, predicted prices will climb and seven estimated
there will be little change. Last week, 46 percent of survey
respondents forecast the market would drop.  U.S.  crude stockpiles  fell 9.85 million barrels in the week
ended Dec. 10 to 346 million, according to the Energy Department.
That’s the biggest decrease since May 2008.  Brent crude for February settlement rose as much as 0.6
percent to $92.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Yesterday, the January contract expired at
$91.71, down 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
