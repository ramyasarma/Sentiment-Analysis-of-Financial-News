Turkey’s refiners will have to
produce cleaner diesel fuel as the country switches to a lower
sulfur grade from Jan. 1, potentially reducing demand for
imports from Russia.  Turkish refiners are required to reduce the sulfur content
in diesel fuel to 10 parts per million starting next year, Nafiz
Kaya, a spokesman for the  Energy Market Regulatory Authority ,
said in a phone interview today. Distributors and retailers will
be allowed to sell the motor fuel with a higher sulfur content
until the end of the first quarter, Kaya said.  The introduction of cleaner fuels in the Turkish market
could curb demand for gasoil from Russia, JBC Energy GmbH, a
Vienna-based consulting company, wrote in a report on Sept. 9.  Russia exported 115,000 barrels a day of gasoil to Turkey in
the first five months of this year, about 10,000 barrels a day
more than in the year-earlier period, according to JBC.  “Most of these grades are higher-sulfur material, which
would then have to be de-sulfurized in the region or sent
elsewhere,” JBC said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
