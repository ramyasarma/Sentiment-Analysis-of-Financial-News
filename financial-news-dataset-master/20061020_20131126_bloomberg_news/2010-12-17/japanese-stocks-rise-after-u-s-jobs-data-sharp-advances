Japanese  stocks  fell, sending the
Topix index to its first drop in five days, as trading companies
declined on lower oil and metal prices, and automakers retreated
on concern a weaker dollar will dent export earnings.  Mitsui & Co. , which counts commodities as its largest
source of profit, slumped 2.2 percent. Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest carmaker, dropped 0.9 percent.  Square Enix
Holdings Co. , the creator of the “Final Fantasy” games,
plunged 10 percent after slashing its profit forecast.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.1 percent to 10,303.83
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader  Topix  slid 0.1 percent
to 903.14, with about as many stocks declining as advancing. The
Nikkei rose 0.9 percent this week, a seventh straight gain and
the gauge’s longest winning streak since the eight weeks ended
April 2. The Topix climbed 1.7 percent this week.  “As news flow thins toward the end of the year, shares
will continue to fluctuate,” said  Kenji Sekiguchi , who helps
with strategy and investment in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset
Management Co., which oversees $75 billion.  The Topix has lost 0.5 percent in 2010, compared with gains
of 11 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 9.3 percent
by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Japanese benchmark
were valued at 15.7 times  estimated earnings  on average at
yesterday’s close, compared with 14.6 times for the S&P 500 and
12.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Topix’s average earnings yield, or estimated earnings
per share divided by the stock price, is 5.1 percentage points
more than the 10-year government bond yield. That’s near the
highest level since October 2008, the month after Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed, freezing credit markets.  Technically ‘Overheated’  “Some technical data shows the market is overheated and
that weighs on the market,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities
manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  The 25-day  Toraku index , a measure of daily stock winners
and losers on the Topix, was 147 yesterday. A level of more than
120 suggests to some investors the market is poised to fall. The
index has remained above 120 since Dec. 2.  Trading companies  declined the most  among the 33 industry
groups in the Topix. Mitsubishi Corp. lost 1.1 percent to 2,195
yen. Sumitomo Corp. retreated 1.3 percent to 1,172 yen. Mitsui &
Co. sank 2.2 percent to 1,312 yen.  Crude oil for January delivery lost 1 percent to $87.70 a
barrel in New York yesterday, the lowest settlement since Dec. 1.
The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial
metals including copper and aluminum dropped 0.7 percent
yesterday, a third consecutive decline.  Mitsui, Automakers  Mitsui has lost 3.4 percent in the past two days after the
U.S. government said it sued a Mitsui subsidiary in relation to
the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history.  Automakers fell as the dollar weakened against the yen and
after the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association forecast
that domestic new vehicle sales will fall 9.9 percent next year,
compared with a 7.5 percent gain in 2010.  Toyota fell 0.9 percent to 3,255 yen and was the heaviest
single drag on the  Topix . Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s third-
biggest automaker by sales, declined 1.5 percent to 795 yen.
Suzuki Motor Corp. lost 1 percent to 2,034 yen.  The yen appreciated to 83.79 against the dollar today,
compared with 84.33 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo
yesterday. A stronger yen reduces income at Japanese companies
when overseas revenue is converted into their home currency.  ‘Final Fantasy’  Square Enix  plunged 10 percent to 1,434 yen, the lowest
close since its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in August
1999, and the steepest drop among the Topix’s 1,664 shares. The
company slashed its forecast for full-year net income to 1
billion yen from 12 billion yen, citing delays in game software.
Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc cut their ratings on the stock.  Banks were the biggest support for the Topix. Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. gained 2 percent to 153 yen, the highest
close since June 25, after Nomura Holdings Inc. boosted its
 rating  to “buy” from “neutral.”  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s largest bank
by market value, advanced 1.2 percent to 440 yen. Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc., the second-biggest, rose 1.2
percent to 2,891 yen. The three lenders were Japan’s most
actively traded stocks by value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
