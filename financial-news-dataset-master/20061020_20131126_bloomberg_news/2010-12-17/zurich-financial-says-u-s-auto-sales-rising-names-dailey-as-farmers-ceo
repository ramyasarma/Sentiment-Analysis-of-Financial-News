Zurich Financial Services AG ,
Switzerland’s largest insurer, said revenue from its U.S.
personal auto business is rising after declines that came during
the recession.  “The auto line is starting to modestly or marginally tick
up,” Jeff Dailey, president of personal lines at Zurich’s U.S.
subsidiary Farmers Group Inc., said today in an interview.
“You’re going to see auto go back to historical inflationary
trends which are on average 3 to 5 percent increases a year.”  Dailey, 53, will be promoted to chief operating officer of
Farmers on Jan. 1 and to chief executive officer when  F. Robert Woudstra  retires at the end of 2011, according to a statement
issued today.  Zurich, based in the Swiss city of the same name, bought a
U.S. auto-insurance unit from  American International Group Inc. 
last year. The business competes with Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s
Geico Corp. and Progressive Corp. in making direct sales over
the phone or Internet, rather than through a broker.  “We’re starting to see very good growth, both from a new-
business perspective and the ability to retain customers,”
Dailey said of the unit. “We’ve really returned the growth and
retention numbers back to where they were before AIG ran into
its problems, and actually up a little bit from that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
