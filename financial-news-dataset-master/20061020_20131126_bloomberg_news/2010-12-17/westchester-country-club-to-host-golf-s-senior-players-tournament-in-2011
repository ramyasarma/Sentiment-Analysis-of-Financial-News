Westchester Country Club will host
next year’s Senior Players Championship, the first time the
Harrison, New York, course has staged one of pro golf’s major
tournaments.  The event, on the 50-years-and-older Champions Tour, will
be held Aug. 18-21, the U.S. PGA Tour said in a news release.
Mark O’Meara is the defending champion.  The club was the site of a Tour event from 1967 to 2007.  The Senior Players Championship has been held in late
September or early October in the last four years. It was played
at Baltimore Country Club’s Five Farms East Course from 2007 to
2009 and had been set to return there next year, but the
Maryland club was unable to accommodate the schedule change, the
Tour said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
