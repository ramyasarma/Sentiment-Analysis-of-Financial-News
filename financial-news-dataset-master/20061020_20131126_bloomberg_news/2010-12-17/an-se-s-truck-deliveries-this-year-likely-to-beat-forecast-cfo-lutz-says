MAN SE , Europe’s third-largest maker
of commercial vehicles, said 2010 truck deliveries will probably
top an earlier forecast and that sales gains will continue into
next year powered by demand from emerging economies.  “We’re now somewhat more optimistic than in September”
when MAN predicted global deliveries to rise to a record 115,000
to 120,000 units, Chief Financial Officer  Frank Lutz  said in an
interview yesterday at the company’s Munich headquarters. “It’s
in fact been a little bit better.”  MAN received 5,500 to 6,000 orders per month in October and
November at the main commercial-vehicles division, Lutz said.
MAN aims for a 2011  operating margin  within a target range of
8.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points, he said. MAN may
beat a goal of 6.9 percent in 2010, the CFO said.  European heavy-truck registrations surged 70 percent in
November, their sixth consecutive monthly increase, the European
Association of Automobile Manufacturers said today. MAN,  Volvo
AB  and Scania AB are posting surging profit as sales rebound
from the economic slump. MAN’s third-quarter net income jumped
to 179 million euros ($237 million) from 4 million euros a year
earlier driven by the rising demand.  “The market is expecting a recovery in Europe and good
momentum on the Brazilian side in 2011, and this is a
confirmation of that,” said  Jose Asumendi , an RBS analyst in
London who recommends buying the stock. “MAN is a strong way to
play the truck market.”  Shares Advance  MAN rose as much as 2.71 euros, or 3 percent, to 92.44
euros and was up 1.4 percent to 91 euros as of 10:26 a.m. in
Frankfurt trading. The stock has  gained  67 percent this year,
valuing the German truckmaker at 13.2 billion euros. Scania
climbed as much as 2.2 percent today in Stockholm, while Volvo
advanced as much as 0.8 percent.  Sales  at the German manufacturer rose 21 percent between
July and September to 3.76 billion euros while orders surged 40
percent to 3.72 billion euros. Truck orders gained 73 percent.
Lutz said MAN aims to raise its share of the European market for
trucks weighing six metric tons or more to as much as 18 percent
next year from 16.7 percent in 2009.  “We have no signs at all this recovery could be short-
lived,” Lutz said. “By and large, the fourth quarter will be
very comparable to the third as regards orders and sales.”  Scania Talks  The company is 29.9 percent owned by Volkswagen AG,
Europe’s biggest carmaker. VW, which bought the MAN stake to
help  Scania  fend off the German truckmaker’s hostile bid three
years ago, took a controlling stake in the Swedish company in
2008. MAN and Scania are exploring ways to cooperate and
possibly combine with a goal of cutting development and
purchasing costs.  Lutz said talks with  Scania  on components and joint
purchasing are being delayed by antitrust restrictions. MAN and
Scania would face legal hurdles if they were to team up on
buying parts such as tires or glass because such a move would
increase their purchasing clout over suppliers, he said.  “Over the past months, we thought that many things could
be worked out in an easier way until we realized that the devil
is in the detail,” Lutz said. “At this point in time it’s too
early to say what the outcome of the talks will be.”   Scania  said Nov. 15 it’s considering a merger with MAN to
achieve maximum synergies. Still, no decisions have been taken
on a potential combination of the companies, Scania said then.  Dividend Increase  Lutz said MAN will raise the 2010  dividend  above 1 euro
from 0.25 euros last year. A Bloomberg  estimate  of 24 analysts
showed that MAN will likely pay a dividend of 1.20 euros per
share for this year.  “As a result of the positive business development, we will
make a considerably higher dividend proposal,” Lutz said. “It
will surely begin with a one.”  The fourth quarter may help MAN perform “slightly better”
on full-year targets spelled out in October, the CFO said,
referring to goals to increase  revenue  more than 20 percent from
last year’s 12 billion euros, boost orders by at least 45
percent and achieve an operating margin similar to the nine-
month return on sales of 6.9 percent.  MAN and a group of 23 banks led by  Commerzbank AG  and
UniCredit SpA agreed on Dec. 10 to extend a 1.5 billion-euro
refinancing of loans until December 2015, Lutz said. The
facility, due in December 2011, was “significantly
oversubscribed” with offers to participate more than double the
amount requested, the CFO said.  Refinancing  MAN has no plans at the moment to carry out further
refinancing measures in 2011 as the  truckmaker  doesn’t currently
have any acquisitions “on the radar,” Lutz said.  Business in Brazil, where MAN is the leading maker of
trucks weighing 6 tons or more, may continue to improve in 2011,
especially after government tax subsidies were extended by
another year, according to Lutz.  MAN bought  Volkswagen ’s Brazilian truck operations in March
2009. The manufacturer’s deliveries to Latin America surged 45
percent to 17,476 trucks in the third quarter, increasing year-
to-date sales to 50,464 units. Sales in Brazil, the region’s
biggest market, totaled 12,775 trucks.  “We expect a continuation of the positive development in
Brazil in 2011,” Lutz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
