New Jersey Governor Chris Christie
said he is giving Jeff Gural, chairman of Newmark Knight Frank
and owner of racetracks in New York, an exclusive three-month
opportunity to prepare a bid on the Meadowlands horse racetrack.  The state will stop running races at the Meadowlands if
there’s no deal by April 1, Christie told reporters today in
Trenton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
