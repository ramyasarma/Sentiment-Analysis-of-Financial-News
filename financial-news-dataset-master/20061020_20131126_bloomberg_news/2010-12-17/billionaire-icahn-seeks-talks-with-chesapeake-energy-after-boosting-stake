Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  has
increased his stake in  Chesapeake Energy Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. natural-gas producer, and wants to make the company
more profitable, according to a regulatory filing.  Icahn increased his ownership to about 5 percent from 2.5
percent, according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. He has already had discussions with company
officials about Chesapeake’s operations and “the maximization
of shareholder value,” according to the filing, which was
released after the close of trading today.  On Dec. 15, Icahn agreed to buy Dynegy Inc., the third-
biggest U.S. independent power producer, for $665 million,
outbidding Blackstone Group LP.  Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake’s stock has fallen 10
percent this year as gas prices have declined. The company
announced plans this year to shift its production away from gas
and into crude oil.  Chesapeake’s stock fell 27 cents to $23.30 at 3:15 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
