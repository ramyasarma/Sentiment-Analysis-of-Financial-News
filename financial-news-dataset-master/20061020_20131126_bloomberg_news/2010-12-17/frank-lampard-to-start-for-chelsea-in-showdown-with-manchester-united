Frank Lampard will return to the
starting lineup for Chelsea’s Premier League game with
Manchester United in two days.  Lampard played 15 minutes as a subsitute in last weekend’s
1-1 tie at Tottenham. It was the midfielder’s first action since
being sidelined in August by hernia surgery and a groin injury.  “It is good news because this team missed Lampard, his
ability to score from midfield and his experience,” Chelsea
manager Carlo Ancelotti said on the club’s website.  Chelsea is winless in five league matches and has fallen to
fourth place, three points behind leader United.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
