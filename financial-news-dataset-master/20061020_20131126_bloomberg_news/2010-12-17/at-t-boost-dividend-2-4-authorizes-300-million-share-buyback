AT&T Inc. , the largest U.S. phone
company, boosted its dividend for the 27th consecutive year and
said it will buy back as many as 300 million shares as wireless-
customer gains help its cash flow.  AT&T raised its quarterly dividend 2.4 percent to 43 cents
from 42 cents, representing a 6.5 percent yield on the carrier’s
average share price this year. Analysts including Piper Jaffray
& Co.’s  Chris Larsen  and Credit Suisse Group AG’s  Jonathan Chaplin , both based in New York, expected 43 cents.  The carrier said in a statement its board authorized a plan
to repurchase as many as 300 million shares, marking the first
buyback announcement in three years. At yesterday’s closing
price, the buyback would cost about $8.77 billion. The company’s
market capitalization is about $172 billion.  AT&T, based in Dallas, boosted revenue by $847 million last
quarter from a year earlier to $31.6 billion. Chief Executive
Officer  Randall Stephenson  has attracted 6.1 million wireless
customers this year with devices such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  “The announced repurchase authorization has no expiration,
which gives AT&T more flexibility” for other uses of cash, such
as a spectrum purchase, said Chaplin in a note today. “We
expect AT&T to be in the market repurchasing shares in due
course, which should be a positive for the stock.”  Credit Suisse’s Chaplin had predicted a share repurchase
plan of as much as $12 billion, while Piper Jaffray’s Larsen
said it would be between $8 billion and $10 billion.  AT&T in 2007 set out to buy back about 400 million shares
by the end of 2009. It bought 164.2 million shares in 2008 for
$6.1 billion and 133,000 in 2009 for about $3 million, according
to company statements.  The carrier generated $11.6 billion of free cash flow in
the first three quarters, down 16 percent from a year earlier.  AT&T fell 2 cents to $29.21 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares have added 4.2 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
