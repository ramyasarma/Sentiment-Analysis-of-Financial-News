Gold rose for a third time this week
as concern that Europe’s fiscal crisis will deepen boosted
demand for the metal as a haven.  Irish government bonds declined after Moody’s Investors
Service cut Ireland’s credit rating. The agency said this week
it may downgrade Spain. Gold has surged 26 percent this year, a
heading for a 10th straight annual gain, amid Europe’s
burgeoning debt crisis and as the Federal Reserve bought
government bonds.  “The Fed has kept open the door to more bond purchases,
and the eurozone debt crisis is heating up again,” said  Matt Zeman , a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.
“That will keep a nice floor under gold prices.”  Gold futures for February delivery rose $8.20, or 0.6

interest rates low and investment demand remains strong,”
analysts at Deutsche Bank AG said in a report today.  Gold prices are still down 0.4 this week, the second
straight weekly loss.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 35.1 cents, or 1.2
