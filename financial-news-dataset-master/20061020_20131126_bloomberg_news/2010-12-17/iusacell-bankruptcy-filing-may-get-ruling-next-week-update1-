Grupo Iusacell SA , the Mexican
mobile-phone carrier owned by billionaire  Ricardo Salinas , filed
for pre-arranged bankruptcy in Mexico, seeking a restructuring
plan with creditors for the second time in four years.  A judge may rule on whether to begin bankruptcy proceedings
next week, Gricelda Nieblas, head of the  Federal Institute of
Bankruptcy Specialists , a part of the judicial branch, said in a
telephone interview today. Calls and e-mail messages to
Iusacell’s press office weren’t immediately returned.  Salinas is seeking to revamp the wireless company, Mexico’s
third-largest, after failing to gain ground against larger
 America Movil SAB  and  Telefonica SA  since he bought control of
the company in 2003. Iusacell began talks to renegotiate its
foreign-currency debt in April 2009 and delisted its shares from
Mexico’s stock exchange this year.  Iusacell hasn’t disclosed its number of subscribers since
March, when it had 3.7 million, or 4.4 percent of Mexico’s
wireless market. The company sold new shares and guaranteed new
bonds in 2007 to replace defaulted securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
