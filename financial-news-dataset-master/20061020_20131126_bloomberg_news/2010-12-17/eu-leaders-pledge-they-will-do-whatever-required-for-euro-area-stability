European Union leaders said they
will do “whatever is required” for the stability of the euro
area.   “The euro is and will remain a central part of European
integration,” the leaders said in the draft text of the
conclusions of a two-day summit in Brussels that ends later
today. “We stand ready to do whatever is required to ensure the
stability of the euro area.”  The leaders also expressed “full support” to the European
Central Bank’s measures to combat the crisis, according to the
document, which was obtained by Bloomberg News. “We support the
ECB in its independent responsibility to ensure price stability,
solidly anchor inflation expectations and thereby contribute to
financial stability of the euro area. We are committed to
ensuring the financial independence of the central banks of the
Eurosystem,” according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
