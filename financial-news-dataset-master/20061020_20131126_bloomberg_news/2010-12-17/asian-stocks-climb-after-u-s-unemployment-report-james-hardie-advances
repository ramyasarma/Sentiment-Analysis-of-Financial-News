Asian  stocks  rose for the first time
in three days, sending the MSCI Asia Pacific Index to its second
weekly advance this month, as technology and finance companies
gained on the outlook for earnings.  Samsung Electronics Co. , the world’s second-biggest maker
of mobile phones, climbed 1.7 percent in Seoul after Canada’s
Research in Motion Ltd., the maker of BlackBerry handsets,
reported earnings that beat estimates.  Mizuho Financial Group
Inc.  led Japanese banks higher after Nomura Holdings Inc.
boosted the stock’s rating. Toyota Motor Corp., Japan’s biggest
carmaker, sank 0.9 percent after the country’s automaker’s
association forecast domestic sales will drop next year.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.4 percent to 133.90 as
of 5:15 p.m. in Tokyo, with about nine stocks advancing for
every eight that declined. The gauge is headed for a 0.6 percent
gain this week. It climbed to a 2 1/2-year high this week as U.S.
economic reports boosted confidence in a global recovery, easing
concerns that Europe’s debt crisis and China’s measures to slow
inflation will hurt growth.  “We’re seeing the global economy is gradually
recovering,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo
at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. “Worries about fiscal problems
in Europe will continue. It’s not the kind of issue that can be
resolved in a day or two.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average , Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index, and China’s Shanghai Composite Index fell less than 0.5
percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, Taiwan’s Taiex Index and
South Korea’s Kospi Index climbed at least 0.2 percent.  U.S. Unemployment  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index rose 0.6 percent yesterday to 1,242.87,
its highest close since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. collapsed.  The number of U.S. workers filing first-time claims for
unemployment benefits decreased last week to 420,000, the lowest
level in three weeks, Labor Department figures showed yesterday.

smartphones next year, climbed 1.7 percent to 926,000 won.

profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , the world’s largest
maker of customized chips, climbed 2.4 percent to NT$72.90 in
Taipei, its highest close in 10 years. The company and United
Microelectronics Corp. may win orders as competitors such as NXP
Semiconductors NV and Renesas Electronics Corp. shut plants, the
Commercial Times reported.  Biggest Supports  Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor were the  biggest
individual supports  for the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Sharp Corp., Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, climbed 2.5 percent to 849 yen in Tokyo. The company
will spend 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion) on a production line
to supply screens mainly for Apple Inc.’s iPhone handset, the
Nikkei newspaper reported.  Foxconn Technology Co. , controlled by Taiwan’s richest man,
gained 1.3 percent to NT$116.5 in Taipei after the Commercial
Times said Nintendo Co. of Japan picked Foxconn as the only
Taiwanese company to assemble its 3DS video-game consoles.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 11 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 11 percent by the S&P
500 and 9.3 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.7 times estimated earnings on
average at yesterday’s close, versus 14.6 times for the S&P 500
and 12.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Banks, Brokerages Gain  “Market valuations are quite attractive,”  Shane Oliver ,
