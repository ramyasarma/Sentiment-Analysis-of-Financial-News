Square Enix Holdings Co. , the
Japanese creator of “Final Fantasy” game series, fell the most
in more than two years in Tokyo trading after cutting full-year
profit forecast 92 percent.  Square Enix  tumbled 10 percent to close at 1,434 yen, the
biggest drop since October 2008. The stock lost 26 percent this
year, compared with a 2.3 percent retreat in the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Net income  will probably fall to 1 billion yen ($12
million) in the year ending March 31 compared with an earlier
forecast for 12 billion yen, the company said yesterday. Japan’s
largest maker of role-playing video games is predicting its
 smallest  annual profit since 2003, when the company was formed
after the merger of Square Co. with Enix Corp.  Profit is expected to slump because of the delay in
releasing “Final Fantasy XIV” online game for Sony Corp.’s
PlayStation 3 and “ Deus Ex ” title for the PS3 and Microsoft
Corp.’s Xbox 360, the Tokyo-based company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
