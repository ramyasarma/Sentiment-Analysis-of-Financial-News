Irish banks’ senior bonds plunged
after Moody’s Investors Service cut the nation’s credit rating
by five levels, citing its declining financial strength and the
cost of bailing out lenders.  Allied Irish Banks Plc’s 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) of
senior floating-rate notes due September 2011 dropped 5 cents on
the euro to 84 cents as of 10 a.m. in London, according to
Jefferies International Ltd. prices on Bloomberg. The bank’s 1.8
billion euros of 3.25 percent government-guaranteed bonds due
February 2013 dropped 4.39 cents to 87.82 cents, Jefferies
prices show.  Bank of Ireland Plc’s 974 million euros of senior 4.625
percent April 2013 notes declined 2.5 cents to 83.5 cents on the
euro, according to Jefferies. The Dublin-based lender’s 420
million euros of subordinated 4.625 percent notes maturing in
February 2019 dropped 1 cent to 47.  Moody’s cut Ireland’s rating to Baa1, or three levels above
junk, from Aa2, giving it a negative outlook. The country is now
rated the same as Russia and Lithuania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
