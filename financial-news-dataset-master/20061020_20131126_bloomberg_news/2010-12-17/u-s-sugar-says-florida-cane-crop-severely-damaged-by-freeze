U.S. Sugar Corp.  said five nights
of freezing Florida weather in the past 10 days “severely
damaged” a cane crop already hurt by a “record-smashing”
deep freeze in January.  “These multiple hard freezes impacted 100 percent of our
sugar cane crop,”  Judy Sanchez , a spokeswoman at the
Clewiston, Florida-based  company , said today in a statement.
“The impacts could be devastating, not only to U.S. Sugar, but
also to the smaller, independent cane farmers in the area.”  About 60 percent of the mature crop hasn’t been harvested,
and new plants faced temperatures “significantly below” 28
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2.2 Celsius) for four hours, Sanchez
said. Most of the company’s 150,000 cane acres (60,700
hectares) were hit by temperatures of 32 degrees or lower for
as long as 12 hours, according to the statement.  Temperatures were below freezing in Palm Beach County, the
state’s main sugar-producing county, for less than 12 hours,
said  David Salmon , a meteorologist at Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri.  Closely held U.S. Sugar also owns 21,000 acres of  citrus
groves. The freeze iced some of the fruit, and the impact is
still being evaluated, Sanchez said.  Florida is the biggest U.S. sugar-producing state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
