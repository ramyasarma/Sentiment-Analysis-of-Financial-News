Woori Investment & Securities Co. 
led South Korean brokerages higher in Seoul trading as investors
speculated trading volumes will increase as the benchmark stock
index approaches a record-high.  Woori Investment, the third-largest by market
capitalization, surged 6 percent to 23,050 won as of 10:47 a.m.
on the Korea Exchange, the most in five months. Daewoo
Securities Co., the second biggest, climbed 5.1 percent to
26,700 won and Mirae Asset Securities Co. gained 4.6 percent to
58,700 won. The  Kospi Index  rose 0.6 percent to 2,021.51,
bringing it less than 50 points away from its record closing
high of 2,064.85 in October 2007.  “The market is showing an uptrend, and there are growing
expectations that trading value and volume will increase,” said
 Cho Soung Kyung , an analyst at KTB Securities Co.  The Kospi has climbed 20 percent this year as a continued
recovery in the nation’s economy and speculation that the won
will strengthen drew overseas investors, making it the best
performer among the world’s 15 biggest markets.  South Korea’s stock market  may climb to 2,450 in 2011 as
the economy rebounds “strongly” in the first half, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by  Goohoon Kwon  said this month,
favoring technology companies, automakers, brokerages and banks.
Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. also forecast gains for South Korean
equities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
