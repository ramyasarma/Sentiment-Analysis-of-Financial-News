Poland will try to complete this
year the sale of Enea SA, the country’s third-largest utility,
to increase revenue from state-asset sales,  Dziennik Gazeta
Prawna  reported, citing a person familiar with the transaction.  The Polish government yesterday picked  Electricite de
France SA  for exclusive talks to buy Enea and said it plans to
sell the company by end of March. EDF pledged not to sell the
utility for the next 10 years and to continue Enea’s
investments, Dziennik said.  EDF also agreed to increase its price offer, Dziennik said,
without giving a value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
