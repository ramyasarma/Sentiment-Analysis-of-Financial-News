Kansas City Federal Reserve
President  Thomas Hoenig  said employees of banks under Fed
supervision may display religious symbols, reversing a ban on
Christian verses and Christmas symbols at a community bank in
Oklahoma.  Following the Fed’s decision, Payne County Bank in Perkins,
Oklahoma, restored Bible verses to its website and the display
of Christian symbols and Christmas items in its building, the
community bank said today. They were removed after a  Kansas City
Fed  examiner said they could be regarded as discriminatory and
impede fair lending, the bank said.  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, “as interpreted by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, does not apply
to jewelry or other personal items displayed in the workplace,”
Hoenig said today in a statement.  Senior Kansas City Fed officials conferred with the Fed in
Washington before allowing the bank to restore the Christian
symbols, the community bank said in a statement on its website.  The bank said it appreciated “the generous outpouring of
support and prayers of Americans from all over.”  U.S. Senator  Jim Inhofe  and Representative  Frank Lucas ,
both Republicans from Oklahoma, complained about the examiner’s
decision today in a joint letter to Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke .  “This is an all out assault on the faith, values, and
rights of the bank, its employees and the people of Perkins they
serve,” Inhofe said in a statement posted on his website. He
called for the Fed to “rectify this situation quickly.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
