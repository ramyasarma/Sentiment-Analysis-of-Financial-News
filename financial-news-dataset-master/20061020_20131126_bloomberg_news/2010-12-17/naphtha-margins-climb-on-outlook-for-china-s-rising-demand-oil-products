Asia naphtha margins rose for a
second week on optimism that petrochemical demand in China will
remain strong. Gasoline declined for the first time in eight
weeks.  Light Distillates  The premium of naphtha for delivery to Japan to Brent
crude, or the crack spread, rose to $166.87 a metric ton at 5:41
p.m. Singapore time, from $161 a ton at the end of Asian trading
on Dec. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Open-
specification naphtha  for delivery to Japan gained $11.50, or
1.4 percent, to $860 a ton this week.  Benchmark  92-RON gasoline  fell 0.2 percent to $99.75 a
barrel, the first decline in eight weeks. Asia gasoline’s
premium to naphtha, or the  reforming margin , dropped to $6.05 a
barrel from $7.35 on Dec. 10, Bloomberg calculations showed. A
narrower gap signals that naphtha is more valuable to refiners
relative to gasoline.  Glencore International AG sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for
first-half February delivery to Sempra Energy at $866 a ton,
traders said. Total SA sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline
for loading Jan. 1 to Jan. 5 to Vitol Group at $99.80 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Benchmark  gasoil , or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur
slipped 10 cents this week to $102.35 a barrel, according to
Bloomberg data. Prices gained 1.9 percent last week.  Jet fuel 
gained 30 cents, or 0.3 percent, for the week to $103.45.  In Singapore, Asia’s biggest oil-trading center, Trafigura
Beheer BV bought 300,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil
from Hin Leong Trading Pte at 20 cents a barrel below benchmark
quotes, traders said. The most recent transaction Dec. 14 was at
a 5-cent premium.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude dropped 19 cents to $13.23
a barrel, the lowest this month, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates, a brokerage. This  crack spread , a measure of
refining profit, has fallen 14 percent since reaching $15.43 on
Dec. 7, the widest since January 2009.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil climbed 5 cents to $1.20 a
barrel, the widest since Dec. 6, PVM said. A rising  regrade 
indicates aviation fuel is more profitable compared with diesel.  Fuel Oil  The benchmark  180-centistoke fuel oil  rose this week,
tracking gains in crude oil costs.  The price of 180-centistoke grade increased 1.9 percent
this week to $516.75 a ton, while the price of  380-centistoke
fuel oil , mainly used as marine fuel,climbed 0.9 percent to $504
a ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Asian benchmark
Dubai crude increased for a fourth week to $90.06 a barrel.  The fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or  crack spread ,
narrowed this week to $9.94 a barrel today from $10.30 a barrel
on Dec. 10.  China’s fuel oil imports may drop 4 percent to 1.54 million
tons in December from an estimated 1.6 million tons in November,
the Shanghai-based commodity researcher C1 Energy said in an e-
mailed report today.  Brightoil Petroleum Group bought a 27,000-ton cargo of 180-
censtistoke fuel oil and three 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-
centistoke grade in the spot market.  Brightoil purchased the 180-centistoke fuel oil cargo from
Vitol Group at 50 cents a barrel above Singapore fuel oil
assessments for loading from Jan. 1 to Jan. 5, said traders.  Brightoil bought two 380-centistoke grade cargoes from
Gunvor International BV for Jan. 1 to Jan. 5 loading and Jan. 6
to Jan. 10 loading at a premium of 50 cents over the assessment.  It bought another cargo from Westport Petroleum Inc. at 50
cents a barrel above the assessment for loading between Jan. 12
and Jan. 16.  Refinery News  Cosmo Oil Co., a Japanese refiner partly owned by the
government of Abu Dhabi, plans to restart the 50,000 barrel-a-
day No. 5 crude distillation unit at its Yokkaichi refinery by
Dec. 19, spokesman Katsuhisa Maeda said. The unit was shut on
Dec. 8 because of a power shortage.  -- Editor: Jane, Ching Shen Lee  To contact the reporter on this story:
