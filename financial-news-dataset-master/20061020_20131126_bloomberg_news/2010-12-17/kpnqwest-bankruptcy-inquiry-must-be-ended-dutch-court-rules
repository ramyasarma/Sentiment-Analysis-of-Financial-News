The Dutch Supreme Court said a probe
into KPNQwest NV’s 2002 bankruptcy must be ended, allowing a
settlement between the firm’s parent companies,  Qwest
Communications International Inc.  and  Royal KPN NV , and
investors to be completed.  The probe by court-appointed investigators into
mismanagement at KPNQwest will be closed, Willem van Schendel, a
spokesman for the Supreme Court in The Hague, said by telephone
today. The ruling overturns a decision by the Amsterdam Court of
Appeal’s Enterprise Chamber, he said.  Hoofddorp, Netherlands-based KPNQwest, a joint venture of
KPN and Qwest, was declared bankrupt in 2002 after building a
60-city phone and Internet network just before prices for
telecommunications services collapsed. Dutch shareholder group
VEB, representing about 5,500 investors, had agreed to complete
a 19 million-euro ($25 million) settlement, once the inquiry it
had sought was dropped.  “The VEB welcomes the Supreme Court’s ruling,” the
shareholder group’s director, Jan Maarten Slagter, said in an e-
mailed statement. The settlement ends an eight-year-old fight
over compensation for losses suffered because of the bankruptcy,
Slagter said.  The separate court-appointed administrators will continue
with a civil lawsuit filed against Denver-based  Qwest , The
Hague-based  KPN  and 12 executives, said Marcel Windt, one of
KPNQwest’s administrators at law firm Houthoff Buruma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
