South Africa  proposed amending its
labor laws to fine companies 2 percent of annual sales if they
don’t meet targets for hiring black, women and disabled workers.  The fine may increase to 10 percent of sales for repeat
offenders, the  Department of Labour  said in a statement sent by
e-mail today. The department said it is seeking public comment
on the changes until Feb. 17.  After the 1994 end of white minority rule, which allowed
companies to discriminate against blacks, South Africa’s
government introduced laws that forced businesses to favor
blacks in the workplace. The 2002 Black Economic Empowerment
laws also obliged mining companies to be 26 percent black-owned
by 2014.  South Africa is the world’s second most unequal country
after Namibia in terms of income distribution, according to the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook. Its Gini
coefficient, a measure of inequality, was 0.666 in 2008, little
changed from 0.665 in 1994. A Gini reading of 1 reflects
complete inequality, while zero represents equality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
