The National Football League Players
Association filed a grievance on behalf of Washington Redskins
defensive tackle  Albert Haynesworth , who was suspended without
pay on Dec. 7 for what the team called detrimental conduct.  The grievance, which contends that Haynesworth’s suspension
was unjust, was filed yesterday, NFLPA director of
communications  Carl Francis  said in an e-mail. Haynesworth, 29,
stands to lose more than $847,000 in salary as he sits out the
final four games of the National Football League season, the
Washington Post  reported .  The association will now seek to prove to an arbitrator
that the Redskins treated Haynesworth unfairly. The nine-year
veteran declined to pursue an expedited appeal that, if won,
would allow him to play again this season, because it didn’t
appear the Redskins would play him even if he the suspension was
removed, the Post said.  Haynesworth signed a seven-year contract last year that the
ESPN said was worth $100 million, including $41 million
guaranteed. The two-time Pro Bowl selection skipped a mandatory
two-day training camp in June after accepting a $21 million
bonus check on April 1. He also failed multiple fitness tests
early in July’s training camp, after skipping the team’s off-
season conditioning program.  At the time of Haynesworth’s suspension, coach  Mike Shanahan  said the defensive tackle had told General Manager
 Bruce Allen  that he would no longer speak with Shanahan.
Haynesworth had 16 tackles and 2½ sacks in seven games this
season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
