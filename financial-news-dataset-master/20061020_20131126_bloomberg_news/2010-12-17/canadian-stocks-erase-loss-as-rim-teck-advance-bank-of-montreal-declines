Canadian stocks rose, erasing a loss
in the main equity index, as Research In Motion Ltd. advanced on
its profit and sales forecast and Teck Resources Ltd. gained on
higher copper prices.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index increased 6.92
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,188.15 at 1:42 p.m. in Toronto,
after falling as much as 0.7 percent.  Research In Motion climbed 2.9 percent to C$61.33 after
saying revenue this quarter will be at least $5.5 billion and
profit will be at least $1.74 a share, beating the average
analyst projections. Teck, the country’s biggest base-metal
producer, rose 2.7 percent to C$57.59 as copper headed for a
weekly gain.  Bank of Montreal led decliners in the index, falling 6.3
percent to C$58.12, after agreeing to buy Milwaukee-based
Marshall & Ilsley Corp. for about $4.1 billion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
