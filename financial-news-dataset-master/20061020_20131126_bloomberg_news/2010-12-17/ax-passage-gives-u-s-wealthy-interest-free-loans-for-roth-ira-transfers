The extension of current income-tax
rates gives wealthy taxpayers the equivalent of an interest-free
loan if they convert a regular Individual Retirement Account to
a Roth by Dec. 31.  Investors in traditional IRAs pay taxes up front on
conversions to Roth IRAs to get tax-free withdrawals later.
Earners in the highest tax brackets who expected rates to rise
next year were faced with reporting all the additional income
from conversions on their 2010 returns. With the tax
legislation, wealthy savers can now defer and use those tax
dollars to earn something, according to  Christine Fahlund , a
senior financial planner at Baltimore-based  T. Rowe Price Group
Inc .  “It’s the deal of the century,” said  Ed Slott , a
certified public accountant in Rockville Centre, New York, and
founder of website irahelp.com. “It’s like Congress is giving
you an interest-free loan to build a tax-free savings account.”  This year taxpayers can choose to report the taxable income
from the conversion in 2010, or split it equally between 2011
and 2012. Federal income-tax rates were set to rise in 2011 to
as high as 39.6 percent, up from 35 percent, when tax cuts
instituted by President  George W. Bush  were to expire.  The Senate passed an $858 billion tax-cut plan Dec. 15 that
would keep existing income tax rates for all earners through
2012. The House voted 277-148 for final passage even though many
House Democrats wanted to limit the tax cut extension to the
first $250,000 of family income. President  Barack Obama  signed
the measure into law this afternoon.  Tax Brackets  That means a taxpayer in the top income bracket with an
IRA worth $1.2 million would likely pay 35 percent or $420,000
in federal taxes when converting the entire account to a Roth
IRA this year, according to Fahlund. They would have paid
$475,200 if income tax rates had increased in 2011 to 39.6
percent, or $55,200 more in taxes.  Conversions work best for savers who know they’re going to
be in as high or higher tax brackets in the future, and can pay
the taxes with money from outside the IRA, said James Lange, a
Pittsburgh-based certified public accountant and author of “The
Roth Revolution: Pay Taxes Once and Never Again.”  Deferring the income from conversions made this year makes
sense for most taxpayers who will be in the same or lower tax
brackets in 2011 and 2012, said Slott, the accountant.  New York Payers  For New York taxpayers, there’s a potential additional
benefit of deferring, said  Mitch Drossman , national director of
wealth planning strategies for New York-based U.S. Trust, which
manages almost $300 billion in client assets.  New York state 
income-tax rates rose to as high as 8.97 percent from 6.85
percent in 2009 and are scheduled to fall back to 6.85 percent
in 2012. That means savers can defer the income to a time when
they may have lower tax rates, Drossman said.  The Internal Revenue Service lifted income restrictions
this year on converting to Roth IRAs from traditional  IRAs ,
meaning taxpayers making more than $100,000 a year in adjusted
income can make the change. There’s no cap on the amount that
can be converted to a Roth IRA from a traditional IRA.  It’s too early to know whether taxpayers are electing to
report the income on 2010 conversions on their 2010 returns or
wait until 2011 and 2012. They have until April 15, 2011 plus
any extensions to decide, said Fahlund of T. Rowe. The firm saw
more than a fourfold increase in the number of investors
converting in 2010 through November compared with a year
earlier, she said.  Conversions Increase  Vanguard Group Inc. based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania,
has seen a fivefold increase in the number of Roth IRA
conversions this year to about 150,000 as of the end of November
compared with 2009, said Maria Bruno, who specializes in
retirement and retirement income for the largest U.S. mutual-
fund manager. USAA in San Antonio has seen a fourfold increase
in members converting some or all of their traditional IRA
assets to a Roth IRA through October, said Kevin O’Fee,
assistant vice president of USAA Retirement Strategies.  The taxes owed on switching to a Roth IRA from a regular
IRA depend on whether the assets being transferred are pre- or
post-tax dollars. If tax-free dollars are included, converters
will pay  income-tax rates  on a percentage of the conversion
amount, said Slott, the accountant.  Savers who expect to be in a lower tax bracket in 2010 than
in 2011 or 2012 shouldn’t defer the income from the conversion,
said David M. First, a tax partner at accounting and advisory
firm Marcum LLP in New York. And those who are going to be
affected by the alternative minimum tax in 2010 and not in 2011
and 2012 may also want to report the income in 2010, First said.  Partial Transfers  Since the default option set by the IRS for those who
switch is splitting the income between 2011 and 2012, wealthy
taxpayers opting to defer don’t have to do anything, according
to John Bledsoe, founder of John Bledsoe Associates, an estate
and tax planning firm in Dallas, Texas, whose clients have an
average net worth of at least $10 million.  “For most people, advising them not to convert now is like
telling them to not wear a seat belt while driving,” Bledsoe
said. “There’s no logic for not doing it.”  When converting to a Roth IRA, savers should try to avoid
converting so much in one year that it bumps them into a higher
tax bracket, said Fahlund of T. Rowe. One option is to do
partial conversions so the income is smaller, she said.  Investors who later change their minds about a Roth IRA
have until October 2011 to  undo  the switch. Savers may also want
to set up more than one Roth IRA to invest separately in stocks
and bonds so they can undo a particular portion of the
conversion if an asset class performs poorly, said Drossman of
U.S. Trust.  Charitable Giving  For savers age 70 and a half and over, the tax bill
includes a provision that allows them to give up to $100,000
from a traditional IRA directly to charity without incurring
taxes.  In 2010, donors had to include the distribution as income
and received a charitable income-tax deduction for their gifts.
The bill would restore the exclusion from income retroactive to
the beginning of 2010 and extend it to 2011 as well, said  Kim Wright-Violich , president of San Francisco-based Schwab
Charitable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
