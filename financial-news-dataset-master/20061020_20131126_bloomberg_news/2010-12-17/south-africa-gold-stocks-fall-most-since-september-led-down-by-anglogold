South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa Gold
Mining Index  headed for its biggest drop in three months as
concern eased that Europe’s debt crisis will spread, lessening
the safe-haven appeal of the precious metal.  The index lost 2.4 percent to 2,764.86 at 1:04 p.m. in
Johannesburg. A close at that level would be the biggest drop
since Sept. 15. Gold traded little changed today after sinking 1
percent yesterday, when South African markets were closed for a
public holiday, and lost 1.2 percent Dec. 15.  “There is some comfort, and risk fears may be receding
over Europe, which then translates itself through a lower gold
price and therefore lower gold stocks,”  Patrick Mathidi ,
portfolio manager at the Johannesburg-based RMB Asset
Management, said in a telephone interview.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. , the world’s third-largest gold
producer, slumped 3.3 percent to 334.63 rand, poised for its
biggest retreat since Sept. 15.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd. ,
Africa’s third-biggest producer, dropped 1.92 rand, or 2.2
percent, to 86.10 rand.  Gold Fields Ltd. , the continent’s
second-largest producer, fell 1.70 rand, 1.4 percent, to 124.20
rand.  “South African gold mining companies are highly leveraged
to the gold price,” said Mathidi. “Any slight move in the
price of gold can make a big material difference on their
earnings.”  Gold producers with smaller assets and market value also
declined.  DRDGold Ltd.  lost 9 cents, or 2.6 percent, to 3.35
rand, the lowest since Nov. 3.  Simmer & Jack Mines Ltd. 
decreased 1 cent, to 1 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
