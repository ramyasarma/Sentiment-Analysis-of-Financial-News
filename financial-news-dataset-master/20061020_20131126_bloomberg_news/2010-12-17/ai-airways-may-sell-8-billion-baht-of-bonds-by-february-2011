Thai Airways International Pcl , the
nation’s largest carrier, may sell as much as 8 billion baht
($265.6 million) of bonds by February next year to take
advantage of a decline in borrowing costs.  The company’s board approved the bond sale plan today,
though details aren’t complete,  Raj Tanta-Nanta , vice president
for investor relations, said by phone. The proceeds may be used
to refinance  debt  or fund the carrier’s fleet expansion.  TRIS Rating Co. today upgraded Thai Airways’ debt rating to
“A+” from “A” and rated the proposed bonds “A+”, citing an
improved financial profile following a share sale in September,
the rating company said in a statement. The company last month
announced plans to put 37 new airplanes into service by the end
of 2017 as it replaces an aging fleet and adds routes.  “The bond sale will help diversify our debt portfolio,”
President  Piyasvasti Amranand  told reporters today in Bangkok.  Thai Airways expects revenue to grow about 10 percent next
year as it fills 74.6 percent of its seats, up from an average
of 65 percent this year, he said.  The company’s board also today approved a 2.3 billion baht
budget to improve in-flight entertainment on six planes,
Piyasvasti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
