Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd. said it
asked South Africa’s National Treasury for more information
about the award of a 4.16 billion rand contract to supply AIDS
treatments.  The company wants more information on two products which
made up the “majority” of the tender, spokesman Mike Mabasa
said by phone from Johannesburg today.  Shares in Adcock fell the most in a year on Dec. 14 after a
rival got a bigger portion of the contract for which it had
tendered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
