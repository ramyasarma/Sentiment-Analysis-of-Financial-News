Natural gas futures rose for the
first time in four days, reducing a weekly loss on signs that
the U.S. economic recovery is strengthening.  Gas advanced after the index of U.S. leading economic
indicators increased in November by the most in eight months.
Prices were lower earlier as forecasts by the  National Weather
Service  showed temperatures will be in a normal range in the
U.S. Northeast from Dec. 24 to Dec. 30.  “Gas should be moving higher with the economy,” said
 Peter Beutel , president of trading advisory company Cameron
Hanover Inc. in New Canaan, Connecticut. “It looks like maybe
we are going to have some more moderate weather, but it’s still
winter and it’s cold. What we are seeing today is maybe the
final gasp of long liquidation.”  Natural gas for January delivery rose 1.8 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $4.066 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas fell 8 percent this
week, the most since Aug. 27.  “Gas prices have fallen as far as they are likely to on
this decline, and we should see the cold-weather dynamics return
to the fore in this market,” Beutel said.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the economic outlook for
the next three to six months rose 1.1 percent, the New York-
based group said today.  ‘Some Strength’  “Data are showing some strength in the economy,” said
 Cameron Horwitz , an analyst in Houston at Canaccord Genuity. A
stronger economy “is certainly supportive in terms of the
industrial gas demand side.”  There will be “a slow transition to a warmer” weather
pattern in the U.S. in the 11- to 15-day forecast, according to
MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in Rockville,
Maryland.  New York will have a high of 38 degrees Fahrenheit (3
degrees Celsius) on Dec. 30, 1 degree below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania. Boston will
have a high of 30 degrees.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas stockpiles slipped 164 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Dec. 10 to 3.561 trillion cubic feet, the Energy
Department reported yesterday. Analysts had estimated a drop of
165 billion. Inventories were 9.9 percent above five-year
average.  ’Not Remarkable’  “On a weather-adjusted basis, the storage withdrawal was
not remarkable, continuing the trend so far this season,”  James R. Crandell , an analyst with Barclays Capital in New York, said
in a note to clients today.  Gas stockpiles will total 1.833 trillion cubic feet at the
end of the winter heating season in March, about 171 billion
cubic feet higher than at the end of March 2010, the Energy
Department said on Dec. 7 in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook report.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, fell for a fourth day by 20.08 cents, or 4.8 percent,
to $3.993 per million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
248,042 as of 2:50 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 284,000. Volume was 378,837 yesterday. Open interest was
792,270 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
790,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
