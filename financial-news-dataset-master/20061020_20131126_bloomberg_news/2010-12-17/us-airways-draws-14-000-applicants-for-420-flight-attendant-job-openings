US Airways Group Inc. , the smallest
of the full-fare U.S. carriers, received 14,000 applications for
420 flight attendant positions.  The influx follows a similar experience in October at Delta
Air Lines Inc., which received 100,000 submissions for 1,000
such jobs. Both carriers offered furloughed employees the chance
to return to their jobs before hiring new workers.  The hiring at US Airways and Delta contrasts with total
employment by U.S. passenger airlines, which has fallen for 28
straight months on a year-over-year basis through October,
according to the U.S.  Bureau of Transportation Statistics .  “We’re obviously thrilled, not just with the volume but
also the quality and passion and enthusiasm these applicants
have for these jobs,”  Jim Olson , a spokesman for Tempe,
Arizona-based US Airways, said today in an interview. “The
response also shows that being a flight attendant is a highly
desirable position.”  US Airways is adding attendants and pilots next year to
cover expected retirements and attrition, the integration of
larger planes into its fleet and more international flying.  Among the US Airways job candidates, 2,535 were flight
attendants at other carriers, the airline said in an employee
newsletter. The carrier is still sorting through applications,
Olson said. All of the new employees will be on the job by the
middle of next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
