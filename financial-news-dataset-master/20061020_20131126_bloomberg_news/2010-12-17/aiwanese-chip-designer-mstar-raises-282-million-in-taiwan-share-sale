MStar Semiconductor Inc. , a
Taiwanese chip designer, raised NT$8.4 billion ($282 million) in
the island’s biggest initial public offering this year.  MStar sold 28 million new shares at NT$300 each, according
to a statement filed with the stock exchange. The Hsinchu,
Taiwan-based company offered the stock to investors at between
NT$250 and NT$310 a share.  The share sale comes as Taiwan Stock Exchange aims to reach
a historical high in public offerings next year amid stronger
relations with China. The island has 45 announced IPOs this year,
compared with 35 last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Cross-strait ties have improved since Taiwan
President  Ma Ying-jeou  took office in May 2008, dropping the
pro-independence stance of his predecessor.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Capital Securities Corp. were
the underwriters to the issue.  Other companies planning to sell shares in Taiwan include
Japan’s  Elpida Memory Inc.  The chipmaker, bailed out by Japan’s
government last year, plans to raise NT$3.7 billion selling
Taiwan Depositary Receipts by the end of March, according to the
company’s filing with the country’s finance ministry on Nov. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
