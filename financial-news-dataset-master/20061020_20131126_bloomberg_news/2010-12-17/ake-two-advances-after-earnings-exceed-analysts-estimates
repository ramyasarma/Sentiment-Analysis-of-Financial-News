Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. ,
publisher of “Grand Theft Auto,” rose the most in more than
five months after reporting its first annual profit without a
new version of the popular video game.  Take-Two  advanced  99 cents, or 8.3 percent, to $12.93 at
4:29 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading , for the
shares’ biggest daily percentage increase since July 7. They
have gained 29 percent this year.  Michael Pachter , an analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los
Angeles, raised his price target to $15 from $11 after Take-Two
reported yesterday that its “Red Dead Redemption” and “NBA
2K10” basketball games led to a fourth-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates.  “The company can generate sustainable earnings growth in
each year if release timing is right,” Pachter, who has a
“neutral” rating on the shares, wrote in a research note
today.  Profit excluding some costs was 67 cents a share, Take-Two
said in a statement, compared with the 31-cent average of seven
analysts’  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey. The company had
forecast 20 cents to 30 cents on that basis.  The results marked the third-straight quarter of
profitability for New York-based Take-Two after losses in three
of the past four years. Net income totaled $53.8 million, or
58 cents a share, as sales rose 32 percent to $373.7 million.
Revenue exceeded analysts’ estimates of $321.3 million.  ‘NBA Elite 11’  “We had any number of exciting releases this year that did
extraordinarily well,” Chairman  Strauss Zelnick  said in a
telephone interview. “We’re firing on all cylinders.”  Take-Two appeared to benefit from  Electronic Arts Inc. ’s
decision to cancel “NBA Elite 11,” a rival basketball game
that was scheduled for October.  The decision probably added $25 million in revenue,  Atul Bagga , a ThinkEquity analyst, said in a research note. San
Francisco-based Bagga rates the shares a “buy.”  In October, Take-Two announced a change to a fiscal year
ending on March 31 from Oct. 31.  For the current quarter ending Dec. 31, Take-Two projects
sales of $290 million to $315 million and profit of 25 cents to
35 cents a share, excluding some items.  To contact the reporter on this story:
