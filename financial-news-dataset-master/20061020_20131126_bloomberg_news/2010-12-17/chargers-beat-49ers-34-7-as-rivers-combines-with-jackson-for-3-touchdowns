Philip Rivers  threw three touchdown
passes to  Vincent Jackson  as the San Diego Chargers beat the San
Francisco 49ers 34-7.  The Chargers improved to 8-6 with their second straight
victory to trail the Kansas City Chiefs by a half game in the
American Football Conference’s West Division. The Chiefs, who
lost 31-0 to the Chargers five days ago, play at the St. Louis
Rams on Dec. 19.  Rivers threw scoring passes of 58, 11 and 21 yards to
Jackson at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.  Brian Westbrook  scored
on a 3-yard run with 4 minutes, 26 seconds remaining as the
49ers avoided a second shutout in less than a month.  The 49ers fell to 5-9 with last night’s defeat, and have
lost six of their seven road games this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
