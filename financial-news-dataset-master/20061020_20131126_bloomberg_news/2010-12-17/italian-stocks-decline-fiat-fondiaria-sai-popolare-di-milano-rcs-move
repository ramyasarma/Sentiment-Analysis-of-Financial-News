Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index

this week.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Azimut Holding SpA  (AZM IM) gained 3.1 percent to 6.57
euros, the highest in three weeks. Shares of Italy’s largest
independent fund manager rose above their 20-day moving average.  Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl  (PMI IM) fell for a sixth
day, losing 1.7 percent to 2.64 euros as European banking stocks

to 2.08 euros.  UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM) retreated 3.2 percent to

biggest utility were placed on review for a possible downgrade,
Moody’s Investors Service said.  Shares of car designer  Pininfarina SpA  (PINF IM) advanced
4.4 percent to 3.36 euros. French billionaire Vincent Bollore

reported, citing Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe. Pininfarina has
an electric-car venture with Bollore.  Prysmian SpA  (PRY IM) rose 1 percent to 12.82 euros,
snapping a three-day decline, as Draka Holding NV remains
uncertain about reaching an agreement about a takeover offer by
Tianjin Xinmao S&T Investment Corp. Draka will continue its
talks with Xinmao, the company said.  Saipem SpA  (SPM IM), Europe’s largest oil-services
provider, increased 2 percent to 35.42 euros. The company won
