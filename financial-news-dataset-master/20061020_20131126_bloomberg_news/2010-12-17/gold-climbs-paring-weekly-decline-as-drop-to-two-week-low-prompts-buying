Gold climbed for the first time in
three days in London as a weaker U.S. dollar boosted demand for
the metal as an alternative asset, and a price drop to a two-
week low prompted purchases. Silver also gained.  The dollar  weakened for a second day against a basket of
six major currencies including the euro and the yen, after
European Union leaders agreed to create a mechanism to contain
future debt shocks and the bloc’s central bank armed itself with
more capital. Bullion typically moves inversely to the
greenback. Gold has gained 26 percent this year.  “You have a weaker U.S. dollar and stable Treasury yields
which eases selling pressure,”  Bayram Dincer , an analyst at LGT
Capital Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland, said by e-mail.
“After hitting some sell-trigger levels yesterday, it is
continuous opportunistic buyers who are buying the dips.”  Immediate-delivery bullion gained $5.75 an ounce, or 0.4
percent, to $1,376.03 an ounce at 8:51 a.m. London time. The
metal touched $1,361.39 an ounce yesterday, the lowest price
since Nov. 29, and has declined 0.7 percent this week. Futures
for February delivery rose 0.4 percent to $1,376.50 an ounce on
the Comex in New York.  Some investors will buy gold if it falls below $1,375 an
ounce,  Bruce Ikemizu , head of commodity trading at Standard Bank
Plc in Tokyo, said by phone today. The price may rise through
the end of 2010, he said.  “I don’t expect too much downside from here,” Ikemizu
said. “Probably we’ll go up gradually. I think we have to wait
until New Year to see a real move.”  Wealth Protection  Gold assets in exchange-traded products fell 1.87 metric
tons to 2,097.83 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14.  The metal is headed for a 10th annual advance, as investors
lost confidence in currencies and sought to protect their wealth
from debt woes in Europe. Gold reached an all-time high of
$1,431.25 an ounce on Dec. 7.  Twelve of 24 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 50 percent, said the metal will fall next week as
investors want to bank profits before the end of the year to
take advantage of gains this year. Eight predicted higher prices
and four were neutral.  Silver for immediate delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $29.03
an ounce, boosting this week’s gain to 1.3 percent. The metal
has surged 72 percent this year, outperforming gold. Silver
holdings in ETPs gained for a sixth straight day, adding 0.94
metric ton to 15,172.49 tons yesterday, the highest amount since
at least February, data from four providers showed.  Spot palladium was unchanged at $742.40 an ounce, while
immediate-delivery platinum increased 0.4 percent to $1,705.20
an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
