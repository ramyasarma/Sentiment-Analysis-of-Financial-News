Italy’s financial police are
investigating companies in nine of the country’s 20 regions for
suspected tax fraud related to fake sales of carbon credits.  Sham transactions may reach “several hundred million
euros,” the financial police said today in an e-mailed
statement. Possible charges include fraud, emission of fake
receipts and money laundering, the statement said.  The European Union has been clamping down on value-added
tax fraud in carbon markets after reports that sellers of
carbon-dioxide permits pocketed VAT collected from buyers and
disappeared before submitting the money to the treasury.  To contact the reporters on this story:
