Crude oil rose as the index of U.S.
leading economic indicators increased in November by the most in
eight months, a signal that the recovery will strengthen next
year and boost fuel demand.  Oil gained 0.4 percent on the U.S. report and one that
showed German business confidence unexpectedly climbed to a
record in December. U.S. fuel consumption jumped 6.5 percent in
November from a year earlier, according to a report today from
the American Petroleum Institute.  “Right now, the crude market is taking its cues from
global and domestic economic growth expectations,” said  Jason Schenker , president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-
based energy consultant. “Such a strong leading economic
indicators number provides further support for a bullish growth
outlook.”  Crude for January delivery climbed 32 cents to settle at
$88.02 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures
increased 0.3 percent this week and 11 percent this year.  The index of U.S. leading economic indicators, the New
York-based Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months, advanced 1.1 percent to the highest level
since March. The reading matched the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The U.S. is the world’s
largest oil-consuming country.  In other signs of growth, the Munich-based  Ifo institute 
said its  business climate index , based on a survey of 7,000
executives, rose to 109.9 from 109.3 in November. That’s the
highest level since records for a reunified Germany began in
1991. Economists predicted a drop to 109, the median of 36
forecasts in a Bloomberg News  survey .  U.S. Fuel Demand  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, climbed to 20 million barrels a day last month from 18.8
million in November 2009, according to the API. Consumption
during the first 11 months of 2010 rose 2.4 percent to 19.2
million barrels a day.  “The uptick in demand is a real good sign about the
economic rebound,” said  John Felmy , chief economist with the
Washington-based API, in a telephone interview. “There’s been a
consistent uptick in demand for industrial fuels this year.”  Total products supplied , a measure of U.S. fuel demand,
climbed 1 percent to 20.2 million barrels a day last week, the
highest level since January 2009, according to an Energy
Department report Dec. 15.  Brent crude for February settlement gained 7 cents to
$91.67 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  Dollar Strengthens  “People are saying the economy is picking up, and if that
is the point, it should lead to either higher demand for crude,
or the U.S. dollar trading higher as people get more
confident,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of
Commodity Broking Services in Sydney.  The dollar gained 0.5 percent to $1.3173 per euro at 3:05
p.m. in New York from $1.3244 yesterday after Ireland’s credit
rating was cut five levels today by Moody’s Investors Service.
The currency has advanced 3.7 percent in the past four weeks.  Moody’s cut Ireland’s rating to Baa1 from Aa2, three levels
above non-investment grade, and said further downgrades are
possible.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities
advanced to a 26-month high today, led by sugar and coffee. It
gained as much as 1.2 percent to 321.04, the highest intraday
level since Oct. 6, 2008. It was up 1 percent at 320.62 at 3:05
p.m. in New York. All the commodities in the index increased.  Trading Range  Oil futures have traded in a range of less than $3 a barrel
in December and have changed direction every day since Dec. 9.  “It’s all about the money flow, and we’ll be following the
dollar and equities,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research at
IAF Advisors in Houston. “It just looks like the market’s kind
of going sideways. It doesn’t want to go above $90 or below
$85.”  Oil may decline next week on speculation the U.S. Energy
Department will report an increase in supplies after the biggest
drawdown in more than eight years in this week’s data.  Eighteen of 34 analysts and traders, or 53 percent,
forecast crude will fall through Dec. 23. Nine respondents, or
26 percent, predicted prices will climb and seven estimated
there will be little change.  U.S.  crude stockpiles  dropped 9.85 million barrels in the
week ended Dec. 10 to 346 million, according to the Energy
Department. Supplies are 7.2 percent above the five-year
average, according to the government report on Dec. 15.  “The physical market is tightening a little bit with the
colder temperatures,” said  Tobias Merath , head of commodities
at Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. “But looking further into the
future, inventories are still high, so I don’t know much further
upside there is. Prices will remain around $90.”  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 540,208
contracts as of 3:05 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 657,203
contracts yesterday, 3.5 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.37 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
