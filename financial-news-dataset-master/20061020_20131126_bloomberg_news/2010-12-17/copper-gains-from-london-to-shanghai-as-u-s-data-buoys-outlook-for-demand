Copper rebounded from London to
Shanghai as better-than-expected U.S. economic data buoyed the
demand outlook for the metal used in construction and household
appliances.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose for the first time in four days, by as much as 0.7
percent, to $9,049.75 a metric ton, and traded at $9,045 by 9:03
a.m. Singapore time. The contract is up for a third week.  The metal for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained for the first day in three, by as much as 0.9
percent, to 67,750 yuan a ton. Futures on the Comex in New York
also climbed for the first time in three days, by as much as 0.5
percent, to $4.1350 a pound.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
