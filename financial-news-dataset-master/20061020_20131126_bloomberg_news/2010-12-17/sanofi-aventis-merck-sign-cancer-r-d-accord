Sanofi-Aventis SA  and Merck KGaA
agreed to jointly study experimental cancer treatments.  Sanofi and Darmstadt, Germany-based Merck will conduct
early stage human trials of Merck’s MSC1936369B and Sanofi’s
SAR245409 and SAR245408 experimental drugs, Paris-based Sanofi
said in an e-mailed statement today. Financial details weren’t
disclosed.  Sanofi seeking ways to replace sales when products
accounting for a quarter of its annual revenue lose patent
protection by 2013. The company is narrowing its business to
three areas -- diabetes, heart problems, and cancer -- and is
seeking partnerships and acquisitions. Merck has encountered
development setbacks over the last 18 months as U.S. regulators
delayed a review of the cladribine multiple sclerosis pill, the
drug failed to win European approval and cancer therapy Erbitux
was rejected for use against lung cancer in Europe.  Under the terms of today’s agreement, each company will
carry out an early-stage dosing test of the experimental
medicines. Sanofi will be granted a license to study the safety
and effectiveness of the Merck compound when used with
SAR245408. Merck will be given a license to work with Sanofi’s
other medicine to study its use in combination with its
experimental compound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
