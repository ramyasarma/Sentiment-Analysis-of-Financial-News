Former Alaska Governor  Sarah Palin 
criticized congressional Republicans for accepting a “lousy
deal” to stop taxes from rising for all income levels next
year.  Palin, a favorite of fiscally conservative Tea Party
activists, said Republicans should wait until next year to pass
legislation extending the Bush-era tax cuts that are due to
expire on Dec. 31. In the new congressional session that
convenes in January, Republicans take control of the House and
expand their numbers in the Senate.  “It is better to wait until they are seated and get a good
deal for the American public than to accept what I think is a
lousy deal,” Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential
candidate, said in an interview broadcasting today on ABC’s
“Good Morning America.”  The $858 billion tax-cut and spending plan extends through
2012 all the tax reductions on income, capital gains and
dividends that were enacted in 2001 and 2003. It continues
expanded unemployment insurance benefits through 2011, cuts
payroll taxes by 2 percentage points during 2011, and lets
businesses write off 100 percent of capital investments between
Sept. 9, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2011.  Palin praised President  Barack Obama  for what she called a
“flip-flop” on his campaign pledge not to extend tax cuts for
families making more than $250,000 per year and for individuals
with annual incomes exceeding $200,000.  Since his Dec. 6 agreement with Republicans on a compromise
bill, Obama has faced a backlash from some fellow Democrats, who
argue that the measure provides too many tax breaks for the
wealthy.  “He, you know, can term it ‘compromise.’ I term it ‘flip-
flop,’” she said. “I was thankful that he did, but it’s still
not good enough.”  Palin, 46, is a possible 2012 presidential contender.  To contact the reporter for this story:
