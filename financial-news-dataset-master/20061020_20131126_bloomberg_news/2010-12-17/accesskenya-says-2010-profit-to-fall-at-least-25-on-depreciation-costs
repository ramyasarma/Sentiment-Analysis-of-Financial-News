AccessKenya Group Ltd. , the
country’s only publicly traded Internet company, tumbled to a
21-month low after saying it expects 2010 profit to fall by at
least 25 percent from last year because of depreciation and
foreign-exchange losses.  The stock dropped 7.5 percent to 13 shillings as of 12:11
p.m. in Nairobi, the lowest intraday level since March 2009.  “The board has already taken steps to reduce borrowing
costs and mitigate exchange-rate risks,” the company said in a
statement to the Nairobi Stock Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
