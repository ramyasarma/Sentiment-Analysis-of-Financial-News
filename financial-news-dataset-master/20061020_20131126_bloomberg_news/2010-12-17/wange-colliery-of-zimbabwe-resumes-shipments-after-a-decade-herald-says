Hwange Colliery Co. Ltd. , Zimbabwe’s
biggest coal miner, has resumed exports of the fuel after more
than a decade, the  Herald  reported.  Shipments to Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and the
Democratic Republic of Congo have started and the company also
plans to export to Tanzania, the Harare-based newspaper said,
citing Managing Director  Fred Moyo .  Production from Hwange is expected to climb to 300,000
metric tons a year from 90,000 metric tons after the miner
bought new equipment, the Herald said, citing Moyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
