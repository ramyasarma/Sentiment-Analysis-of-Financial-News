New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
will nominate  Christopher Cerf , a former deputy chancellor of
the New York City school system, to be state commissioner of
education, said an individual with direct knowledge of the
appointment who requested anonymity.  Christie, a first-term Republican, fired his last education
commissioner,  Bret Schundler , after the state lost out on a $400
million federal Race to the Top education grant. The governor
will make the announcement next week, said the person, who
wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The
appointment must be approved by the state Senate.  Cerf, 56, a resident of Montclair, left his New York City
post in 2009 to work on Mayor  Michael Bloomberg ’s re-election
campaign. He is chief executive officer of  Sangari Global
Education , a New York-based firm that offers support in science
learning to more than 500,000 students worldwide, according to
the firm’s web site. Cerf also served eight years as president
of New York-based  Edison Schools Inc ., a private operator of
public schools, after working as its general counsel from 1997
through 1999.  The appointment was reported yesterday by the Wall Street
Journal.  Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for Christie, declined to
comment on or verify the selection today. Cerf also declined to
discuss the reports when reached by telephone today.  Bloomberg is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Dunstan McNichol  in
