European Union carbon permits fell
to their lowest price since July 28 as the United Nations-
overseen regulator boosted the supply of offset credits.  EU carbon futures for December fell 2 percent to close at
13.98 euros ($18.39) a metric ton on ICE Futures Europe, having
earlier reached as low as 13.97 euros. They are down 4 percent
this week, reducing this year’s gain to 12 percent. UN emission
credits for December fell 1.5 percent to 11.71 euros, reducing
this year’s gain to 6.7 percent.  The  supply of new credits  in the UN’s Clean Development
Mechanism, the world’s second biggest greenhouse-gas market,
will come close this month to reaching November’s record,
IDEAcarbon said in an e-mailed statement.  Issuance may reach 24.4 million metric tons, compared with
a record 24.8 million tons last month,  Alessandro Vitelli , an
analyst at IDEAcarbon in London, said by phone today. The
credits can be used in the EU carbon market. Issuance-request
data suggests January supply will reach about 12.7 million in
the first half of the month, Vitelli said.  The EU is trying to reduce a glut of carbon permits in its
market, the world’s largest, after the  economic recession last
year  damped demand for allowances and credits. The market will
be oversupplied by about 5.9 percent in the five years through
2012, according to a model by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the
carbon-research company based in London that’s owned by
Bloomberg LLP.  EU permits for December may fall to 13.34 euros a ton after
the contract breached a technical support level at 14.15 euros,
said Clive Lambert, an analyst at Futures Tech.  ‘Dark Cloud’  There’s a chance that EU carbon permits for December will
fall as low as 12.75 euros by Dec. 20, when the futures contract
expires, says Brett Genus, emissions options broker at OTC
Europe LLP.  Genus said EU carbon prices showed a “dark cloud”
formation on Dec. 10, a bearish signal formed at the end of an
uptrend. Some analysts believe that indicates the market is
overbought.  Today’s issuance of credits included 6.3 million tons to a
hydrofluorocarbon-23-cutting project in the Jiangsu Province of
China, according to a  UN website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
