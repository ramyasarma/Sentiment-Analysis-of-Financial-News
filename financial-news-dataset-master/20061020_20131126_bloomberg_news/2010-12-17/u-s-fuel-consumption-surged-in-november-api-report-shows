U.S. fuel consumption jumped in
November from a year earlier, a signal that the U.S. economy is
rebounding, according to the American Petroleum Institute.  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, climbed 6.5 percent to 20 million barrels a day last
month, the industry-funded group said today in a report.
Consumption during the first 11 months of 2010 climbed 2.4
percent to 19.2 million barrels a day.  “Fuel demand continues to strengthen, a positive sign for
the economy,”  John Felmy , chief economist with the Washington-
based API, said in the report. “Gasoline deliveries are up
three months in a row and distillate deliveries are up 10 months
in a row.”  Demand for ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, rose 13 percent to average 3.33 million barrels a day,
the report showed. Use of the fuel during the first 11 months of
the year rose 3.9 percent to 2.99 million barrels a day.  Total use of distillate fuel, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, rose 14 percent to 4.01 million barrels
a day. Demand climbed 4.7 percent to 3.78 million barrels a day
through November.  Deliveries of gasoline increased 3.2 percent to 9.19
million barrels a day, the report showed. Consumption during the
year so far averaged 9.06 million barrels a day, up 0.7 percent
from the same period in 2009.  Jet-fuel use surged 17 percent to an average 1.58 million
barrels a day. Daily demand averaged 1.48 million barrels
through November, a 5.8 percent gain.  U.S. crude-oil production rose 0.2 percent to an average
5.44 million barrels a day in November. Output in the lower 48
states increased 1.2 percent to 4.82 million barrels a day.
Alaskan production slipped 7.3 percent to 614,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
