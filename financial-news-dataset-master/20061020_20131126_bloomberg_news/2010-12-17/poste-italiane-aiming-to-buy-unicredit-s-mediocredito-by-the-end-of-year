Poste Italiane SpA , Italy’s postal
service, aims to reach an agreement with  UniCredit SpA  to buy
its project-financing unit MedioCredito Centrale SpA by the end
of this year, Poste Chief Executive Officer  Massimo Sarmi  said.  “We’re close to a deal,” Sarmi said in a phone interview
today. “I hope we’ll be able to close before the end of the
year. We just need to refine the terms.”  State-owned Poste Italiane is seeking to buy Rome-based
MedioCredito as part of a government plan to create a lender to
help boost growth in southern Italy by offering loans to
individuals and businesses. Sarmi and his counterpart at
UniCredit, CEO  Federico Ghizzoni , have mandates to negotiate the
deal, he said.  Poste Italiane made a binding offer for MedioCredito and is
in exclusive talks with Italy’s biggest bank for the asset, the
CEO said. Poste Italiane’s offer for MedioCredito is “around”
its net equity value of about 136 million euros ($180 million),
Sarmi said.  After the acquisition, Poste will sell a stake in
MedioCredito to the postal company’s partner ICCREA, a holding
for cooperative banks, Sarmi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
