Henderson Group Plc , the U.K. money
manager that owns New Star Asset Management Group Plc, is
weighing whether to enter talks to buy Gartmore Group Ltd., a
person with knowledge of the situation said.  Gartmore, the U.K. fund manager that put itself up for sale
in November, is attractive to Henderson because of its consumer
business and emerging markets operations, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private. No
decision to proceed has been taken, the person said.  Gartmore Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Meyer  said last
month he would either merge Gartmore with another firm or seek a
buyer after five fund managers quit, including  Roger Guy  and
 Guillaume Rambourg . Both Schroders Plc and Aberdeen Asset
Management Plc said they won’t bid for the fund manager.  A spokesman in London for Henderson declined to comment and
officials at Gartmore weren’t immediately available to comment.
Sky News reported the talks earlier today.  Gartmore jumped 6 percent to 104.8 pence in London trading,
for a market value of 381 million pounds ($590 million).
Henderson was unchanged at 130.5 pence.  Henderson, which has managed investments for 75 years,
incurred fees of 3 million pounds after ending discussions to
buy parts RidgeWorth Investments Inc., SunTrust Banks Inc.’s
asset-management unit, in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
