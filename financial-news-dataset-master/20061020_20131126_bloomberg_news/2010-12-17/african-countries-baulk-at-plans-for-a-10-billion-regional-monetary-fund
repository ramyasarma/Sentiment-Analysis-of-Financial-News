Government representatives from
across Africa balked at proposals by the African Union to raise
$10 billion for the creation of an African Monetary Fund, the AU
commissioner for economic affairs said.  “We need to look at the basis and determine what is
convenient for member states to contribute,”  Maxwell Mkwezalamba  told reporters during a meeting on how to finance
the AU in Cameroon’s capital, Yaounde, yesterday.  The African Monetary Fund, which will have its headquarters
in the city, will play a similar role to the International
Monetary Fund, a press statement issued at the meeting said. It
will coordinate the payment and settlement of commercial
transactions among AU member countries and create a unit of
account to ease such transactions.  Africa will not “continue to beg” for funding, Essimi
Menye, Cameroon’s Finance Minister, told the meeting. The
African Union currently receives $113 million from outside the
continent, against $11 million from its member countries, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
