Cameroon’s government approved a
plan by South Korea’s C&K Mining to build a diamond mine near
the southeastern town of Yakadouma, Agency France-Presse said.  C&K has been awarded a 25-year license for the project, the
news agency reported, citing the South Korean foreign ministry.
The company has a 65 percent stake in the mine and Cameroon’s
government owns the rest, AFP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
