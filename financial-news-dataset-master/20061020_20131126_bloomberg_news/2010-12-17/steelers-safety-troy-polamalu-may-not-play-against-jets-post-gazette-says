Troy Polamalu of the Pittsburgh
Steelers may not play against the New York Jets on Dec. 19 due
to a lower-leg injury suffered last weekend, the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette reported.  The five-time Pro Bowl safety would be replaced by Ryan
Mundy or Will Allen, the newspaper said.  Polamalu, 29, has six interceptions this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
