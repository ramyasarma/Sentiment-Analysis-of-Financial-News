Cebu Air Inc. said competition from
AirAsia Bhd., which yesterday announced it was forming a
Philippine venture, could hurt earnings.  “Any new capacity is negative,” President Lance Gokongwei
said in an interview in Manila. He said he couldn’t judge the
extent because AirAsia hasn’t said how many planes and flights
it will have. Cebu Air will continue to add planes and flights
while keeping costs down.  Cebu does not have plans of flying within Malaysia or other
countries because of the fast pace at which the Philippine
domestic market is growing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
