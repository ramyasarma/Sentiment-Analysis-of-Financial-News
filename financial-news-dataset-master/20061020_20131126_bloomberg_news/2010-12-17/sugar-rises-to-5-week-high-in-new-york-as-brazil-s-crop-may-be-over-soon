Sugar climbed the most in four weeks
as lower output from Brazil, the world’s largest grower, may
signal a record harvest is nearing an end. Cotton jumped the
most allowed by ICE Futures U.S.  Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South, the biggest
producing region, fell 18 percent in the second half of November
from a year earlier, Unica, an industry group, said on Dec. 14.
The harvest is usually completed in December, according to the
U.S. agricultural attache in Sao Paulo.  “The Unica numbers showed that we are close to the end of
the harvest, which may be a very good support for London and New
York futures,” said Fabienne Pointier, an analyst at Lausanne,
Switzerland-based research company Kingsman SA.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 4.8
