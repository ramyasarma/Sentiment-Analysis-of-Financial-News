Siemens AG  agreed to sell its
minority shareholding in armored-vehicle maker Krauss-Maffei
Wegmann GmbH, the second disposal in a week for the German
engineering company that is focusing on three main businesses.  Siemens will transfer the 49 percent stake to partner, the
Wegmann Group, for an undisclosed sum, the Munich-based company
said in a statement today.  The divestment comes three days after Siemens agreed to
sell its computer-services unit to  Atos Origin SA  in an 850
million-euro ($1.13 billion) transaction ending years of losses
from that business.  Siemens has offloaded underperforming assets including its
telephone network division and its mobile-phone business to
sharpen its focus on industrial goods such as turbines, trains
and medical equipment. It gained the Krauss-Maffei stake in 2001
through the acquisition of Atecs-Mannesmann.  “With this transaction, we continue to diligently execute
on our strategy to focus on our core areas: energy management
and environmental care, industrial infrastructure and health
care,” Chief Financial Officer  Joe Kaeser  said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
