European Union carbon permits
declined to a more than five-week low as natural-gas and power
prices weakened, damping demand for emission allowances.  EU allowances for December 2011 dropped as much as 0.8
percent to 14.45 euros, the lowest level since Nov. 9. They
traded at 14.50 euros as of 8:05 a.m. on London’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange, extending this month’s loss to 3.5 percent.  The contract for delivery this month fell 0.3 percent to
14.22 euros.  U.K. natural gas for delivery next month weakened 0.4
percent to 58.25 pence a therm, according to broker prices
compiled by Bloomberg. Lower gas prices may prompt some power
generators to switch to the fuel, which requires half as many
carbon permits as coal.  German baseload power for next month dropped 0.4 percent to
53 euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker prices compiled by
Bloomberg. Lower prices can reduce the incentive to sell
electricity forward, curbing demand for CO2 permits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
