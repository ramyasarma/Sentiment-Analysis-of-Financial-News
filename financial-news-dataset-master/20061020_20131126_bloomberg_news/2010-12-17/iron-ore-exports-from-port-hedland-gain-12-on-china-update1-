Iron ore shipments from Australia’s
Port Hedland, the world’s largest bulk export terminal, rose 12
percent in November as China bought more of the raw material
used to make steel.  Total exports were 15.7 million metric tons, the Port
Hedland Port Authority said today on its  website.  That compares
with 14 million tons a year earlier. Shipments to China gained
22 percent to 11.8 million tons, it said.  China, the world’s largest metals consumer, imported 26
percent more ore in November, according to figures provided by
China’s General Administration of Customs, as steelmakers
 restocked  on expectations of higher prices. Iron ore prices in
the first three months of next year may rise as much as 7
percent from the current quarter, the Steel Index said last week.  Shipments to Japan gained 27 percent to 1.9 million tons,
the port authority said.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company, and
Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., Australia’s third-largest iron ore
exporter, ship ore from Port Hedland in northwestern Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
