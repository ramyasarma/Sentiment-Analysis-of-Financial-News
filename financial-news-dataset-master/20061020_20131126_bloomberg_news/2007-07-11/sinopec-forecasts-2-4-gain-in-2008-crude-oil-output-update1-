             China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) 
forecast a 2.4 percent gain in crude oil production next year as
the company strains to meet energy demand in the world's fastest-
growing major economy.  
 Sinopec, as China's second-biggest oil producer is known,
plans to produce 817,000 barrels of oil a day in 2008, it said in
a report on sustainable development posted on its  Web site  today.
The Beijing-based company aims to pump 798,000 barrels a day this
year, it said in April, 2 percent more than in 2006.  
 An economic growth pace that reached 11.1 percent last year
has forced China to rely increasingly on imported oil. The nation
shipped in 20 percent more of the fuel last month than a year
earlier, customs figures showed yesterday.  Sinopec (386) 's natural gas
output is accelerating at a faster pace than oil as an expanded
search for energy resources leads to new discoveries.  
 ``We will step up exploration of our new oil and gas
reserves in the northeastern part of Sichuan and the Tahe field
in Xinjiang,'' Sinopec said today, referring to drilling and
production in the nation's southwest and its western-most region.  
 Gas output may jump 25 percent from projected 2007 levels to
967 million cubic feet a day next year, according to figures in
today's report.  
 Sinopec , Asia's largest refiner and supplier of almost two-
thirds of refined oil products sold in China, expects to have
capacity to process 3.81 million barrels of oil a day into fuels
and chemicals. This year it expects to process 3.03 million a day.  
 Fuel Pipelines  
 China's largest listed company by  sales  projects ethylene
production capacity at 7.1 million tons in 2008, compared with
estimated output this year of 6.45 million tons. Oil product
sales are forecast to rise 2.6 percent from estimated 2007 levels
to 120 million tons next year.  
 The company aims to have 6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles) of
crude oil pipelines and 7,200 kilometers of fuel pipelines in
operation next year, it said. The refiner wants to use pipelines
to transport 92 percent of its crude and 40 percent of oil
products in 2008, it said.  
 Sinopec made an oil discovery in western China's Xinjiang
province that may be a third of the size of PetroChina Co.'s
Jidong Nanpu, the country's biggest find in 50 years, its parent
China Petrochemical Corp. said May 30.  
 Sinopec's Puguang gas field discovery in Sichuan, announced
last August, had proven reserves of 356 billion cubic meters of
gas by the end of last year, Sinopec said May 9.  
 Jump in Profit  
 The company said April 16 first-half profit may rise at the
fastest pace since 2004 as refining margins widen and demand
for chemicals used in manufacturing climbs. Net income in the six
months ending June may surge more than 50 percent from the 20.7
billion  yuan  ($2.7 billion) earned a year earlier. First-quarter
net income more than doubled to 19.4 billion yuan.  
 Sinopec and rival PetroChina have sought government approval
to increase the price of gasoline and diesel, the China Business
Journal reported July 9, citing company and industry officials it
didn't identify.  
 Sinopec proposed raising gasoline prices by 200 yuan ($26)
per metric ton and diesel by 150 yuan per ton, the report said.
Sinopec's refining margins have come under pressure because
global oil prices have risen above $70 a barrel, the report said.  
 The company's shareholders will meet Aug. 10 in Beijing to
elect Su Shulin chairman in the place of Chen Tonghai who
resigned June 22 citing ``personal reasons.''  
 China 's crude oil imports climbed to 14.12 million metric
tons (3.45 million barrels a day) in June, the Customs General
Administration of China said in Beijing yesterday. First-half
imports rose 11 percent to 82 million tons.
