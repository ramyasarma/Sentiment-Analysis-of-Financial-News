             Fiat SpA , Ford Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp. led a third consecutive monthly decline in European
car sales as demand dropped with the withdrawal of government
scrapping incentives.  
 Registrations fell 6.2 percent to 1.38 million vehicles in
June from 1.48 million a year earlier, the Brussels-based
European Automobile Manufacturers Association said. First-half
deliveries rose 0.6 percent to 7.5 million.  
 European demand is sagging as governments withdraw or
reduce sales subsidies that were on offer last year to help the
auto industry through the economic crisis. Fiat recorded the
biggest June decline among the major manufacturers, with sales
falling 20 percent. Ford’s registrations tumbled 15 percent,
while  Toyota  dropped 12 percent.  
 “The biggest year-on-year declines have been in Germany
and Italy, which is clearly down due to incentives no longer
being around,” said  Mike Tyndall , a London-based automotive
specialist with Nomura Securities. “It’s a reversal of 2009,
when Europe was stronger than other developed markets thanks to
scrappage payments -- you reap what you sow.”  
 In Germany, which offered the region’s most generous
incentives last year, deliveries slumped one-third to 289,259
vehicles in June. Germany’s plunge contributed to an 8.1 percent
sales drop for Wolfsburg-based  Volkswagen AG , Europe’s biggest
carmaker, while Italy’s 19 percent market decline weighed on
Turin-based Fiat.  
 Updated Forecasts  
 French new-car demand fell 1.3 percent in June, outpaced by
a 5 percent sales slide in Europe for Paris-based  PSA Peugeot
Citroen , France’s biggest carmaker. Smaller domestic rival
Renault SA bucked the decline with a 3.8 percent gain in June,
led by its no-frills Dacia brand, which rose 7.9 percent.  
 Renault now expects Europe’s car market to shrink by 7
percent to 9 percent this year rather than the 10 percent it
predicted in February, sales chief  Jerome Stoll  said July 8,
joining the ranks of industry analysts and executives who have
moderated their forecast declines.  
 Ranjit A. Unnithan , a European automotive analyst with
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in London, this week trimmed his forecast
market drop for western Europe to 6 percent from 9 percent. The
market “is tracking better than expected on most fundamental
metrics,” he said in a July 13 note to investors.  
 “Scrappage incentives have not distorted the new-car
market as much as feared,”  Max Warburton , a London-based
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein analyst said in an e-mail
today.
