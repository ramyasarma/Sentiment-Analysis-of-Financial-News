             Gold in euros may have peaked after
the metal declined to less than the 55-day moving average for
the first time in a year, according to a report from Commerzbank
AG’s technical analyst  Karen Jones .  
 Gold denominated in the single currency reached a record
1,050.88 euros an ounce on June 8 as investor concerns about
Europe’s sovereign debt levels boosted the metal’s allure and
drove the 16-nation currency lower, Jones wrote in a report. The
breach of the moving average at 975 suggests “the market is
forming a top,” Jones wrote. The metal was at 950 euros today.  
 Rising government debt burdens in European nations
including Greece stoked speculation earlier this year that there
may be a breakup of the euro region. The gold market in Europe
“has just taken off” amid the crisis, Australia’s Perth Mint
said last month.  
 “The gold price in euros is now expected to trade below
the psychological 1,000 mark for many weeks,” London-based
Jones wrote. “In fact, near-term rallies are now likely to find
that the 975-to-1,000 zone acts as short-term resistance.”  
 Commerzbank remained bullish on gold in the medium term as
long as the price in euros remained at more than the May 21 low
of 935.21 an ounce, Jones said, without defining the timeframe
precisely. A slide to 933 euros an ounce may prompt a further
decline to 900 euros “pretty rapidly,” she wrote.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to try to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. A resistance level is
marked by a cluster of sell orders.
