             Sellers of default insurance on
about $504 million of Truvo Subsidiary Corp. debt may pay 97
cents on the euro to settle contracts triggered when the
publisher of business directories filed for bankruptcy.  
 Traders set an initial recovery value of three percent on
the Belgium-based company’s bonds in an auction to resolve
credit-default swaps, according to administrators Markit Group
Ltd. and Creditex Group Inc.  
 Truvo USA LLC and four affiliates filed for bankruptcy on
July 1 after Truvo Subsidiary, which publishes directories in
Belgium, Ireland and Romania, didn’t make payments on two senior
note issues totaling $684 million.  
 The settlement price was set in an initial round of bidding
by 14 dealers including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and Barclays
Plc. A final value on the company’s bonds will be determined
during a second round, and announced at 2 p.m. in London on
Creditfixings.com, a website run by Creditex, a New York-based
derivatives broker, and financial information provider Markit.  
 Sellers of credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
set at auction should a company fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  
 Investors bought or sold 2,067 contracts protecting a net
$504 million of Truvo Subsidiary’s debt as of July 9, according
to the  Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. , which runs a central
registry that captures most trading.
