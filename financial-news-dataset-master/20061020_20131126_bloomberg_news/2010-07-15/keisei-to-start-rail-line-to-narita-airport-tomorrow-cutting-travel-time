             Keisei Electric Railway Co.  will
open a  new train line  from Tokyo to Narita International Airport
tomorrow, slashing travel time to Japan’s busiest international
gateway.  
 The new line will ferry travelers between the airport and
Nippori station on Tokyo’s loop line in 36 minutes, the company
said in a statement in Tokyo yesterday, compared with 51 minutes
now.  
 “The new link will help increase Japan’s international
competitiveness,”  Seiji Maehara , Japan’s Transport Minister,
said at an opening ceremony for the line in Tokyo yesterday.
“It will improve access.”  
 Narita airport, which had 32 million passengers last year,
is improving connectivity as Tokyo’s other airport Haneda
expands capacity with the opening of a new runway in October.
Trains from Haneda link the airport with Hamamatsucho on Tokyo’s
loop line in as little as 16 minutes.
