             United Co. Rusal , a shareholder in
 OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , said the management of the nickel
company violated Russian federal law by refusing to provide it
with voting papers from a June 28 annual general meeting.  
 Rusal is seeking to review the papers to “examine them in
detail for evidence of wrong-doing,” the Moscow-based aluminum
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Rusal, which owns
25 percent of  Norilsk , said last week that it asked Russia’s
markets watchdog to probe the vote for irregularities.  
 Rusal won three seats on Norilsk’s board at the AGM, while
Interros Holding Co., which owns another 25 percent of the
stock, got four. Norilsk Chief Executive Officer  Vladimir Strzhalkovsky , one of three company managers to gain a board
seat, said minority shareholders supported representatives of
management, Kommersant reported in an interview published today.  
 “No one has denied Rusal’s demand,” Norilsk spokeswoman
Erzhena Mintasova said today by telephone from Moscow. Russia’s
markets watchdog has collected the voting papers in line with
its investigation into the vote, she said.  
 Norilsk itself turned to the regulator on July 12 to check
the vote because of “all the insinuations and rumors around
it,” Strzhalkovsky told Kommersant.  
 “We still don’t understand why Norilsk would turn over the
originals to the watchdog without making any copies for us,”
Rusal spokeswoman  Vera Kurochkina  said by phone from Moscow
today. Rusal had from the start asked for copies of the voting
papers and was told they would be provided, she said.
