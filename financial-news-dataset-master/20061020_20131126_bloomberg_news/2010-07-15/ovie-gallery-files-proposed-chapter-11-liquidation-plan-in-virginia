             Movie Gallery Inc.,  the video-rental
chain that began shuttering its stores in February, filed a
bankruptcy liquidation plan that would wipe out shareholder
value, a key step in winding up the business.  
 Under the Chapter 11 plan filed July 13 in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Richmond, Virginia, general unsecured creditors would
receive a pro rata share of a $5 million liquidating trust in
cash. The filing didn’t include a disclosure statement further
detailing the proposal.  
 Movie Gallery  sought bankruptcy protection on Feb. 2, the
second time since 2007, and subsequently closed all of its about
2,600 stores. The Dothan, Alabama-based chain, which is
liquidating the last 1,028 locations, got approval this month to
sell warehouse inventory.  
 The company listed  debt  of $500 million to $1 billion and
assets of as much as $50 million in Chapter 11 documents.  
 The plan contemplates court approval of consolidation of
the bankruptcy cases of Movie Gallery and its affiliates. All
assets and liabilities of the affiliates would be merged with
those of Movie Gallery, and all intercompany claims would be
eliminated. Locations in Canada won’t be subject to
consolidation.  
 The case is In re Movie Gallery Inc., 10-30696, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond).
