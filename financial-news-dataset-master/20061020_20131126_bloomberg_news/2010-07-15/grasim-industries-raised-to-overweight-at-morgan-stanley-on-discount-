             Grasim Industries Ltd. was raised to
“overweight” from “equal-weight” by Morgan Stanley analyst
Ashish Jain, who said the stock trades at a “deep discount” to 
its fair value and that a likely “weakness” in the shares over 
the next two months will be an opportunity for investors to add 
to holdings.  
 The brokerage lowered its share-price estimate for Grasim
Industries to 2,260 rupees from 2,820 rupees.
