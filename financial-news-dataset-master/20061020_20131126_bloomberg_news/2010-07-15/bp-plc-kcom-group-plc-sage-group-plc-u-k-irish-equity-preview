             U.K. stocks  fell, reversing an
earlier rally on the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index , after Citigroup
Inc. and Bank of America Corp. reported lower-than-estimated
sales and a report showed U.S. consumer confidence deteriorated.  
 Barclays Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc slid more than 2
percent, as banks led declines in the FTSE 100. BP Plc climbed
1.3 percent after Britain’s second-biggest oil company
temporarily stopped its Gulf of Mexico oil leak.  
 The  FTSE 100  declined 52.44, or 1 percent, to 5,158.85,
paring this week’s gain to 0.5 percent. The gauge has slumped 11
percent from this year’s high on April 15 amid concern that
economic growth will be curbed by austerity measures from
European governments cutting their budget deficits and as data
on the U.S. and Chinese economies disappointed investors.  
 “The U.S. economy is set to face significant headwinds in
the coming months,” said Michael Hewson, a markets analyst at
CMC markets in London. “With the uncertainty that comes with
that, it is difficult to see too much in the way of upside” for
equity markets.  
 Citigroup and Bank of America topped analyst estimates for
per-share earnings while missing on sales. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary  index of U.S.
consumer sentiment  fell to 66.5 in July from 76 a month earlier,
the lowest level in a year.  
 Barclays, HSBC  
 Barclays, the U.K.’s third-biggest bank, declined 5.2
percent to 284.65 pence. HSBC, the largest bank in Europe,
dropped 2.5 percent to 621.6 pence.  
 BlueBay Asset Management Plc, the London-based manager of
fixed-income funds, fell 1.2 percent to 291.6 pence after saying
assets under management slid in the fiscal fourth quarter on
foreign-exchange losses.  
 BP climbed 1.3 percent to 407.15 pence. The company said it
is “encouraged” after a pressure test that halted the flow
from its Gulf of Mexico well indicated no sign of an oil leak
after the first 17 hours.  
 Separately, BP may reach an agreement as soon as next week
to sell assets to Apache Corp. for $10 billion to $11 billion,
including half its stake in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay field,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  
 Burberry Group Plc climbed 1.1 percent to 799.5 pence as
the U.K.’s biggest luxury retailer said it has entered an
agreement to acquire the stores and related assets in China
currently operated by its long-standing franchisees.  
 Spectris Plc jumped 6.7 percent to 891.5 pence, the most
since August 2009, after saying it expects full-year profit to
exceed its forecasts. The U.K.’s largest maker of production-
testing gear also said it sees “signs of recovery” in most
regions and markets.
