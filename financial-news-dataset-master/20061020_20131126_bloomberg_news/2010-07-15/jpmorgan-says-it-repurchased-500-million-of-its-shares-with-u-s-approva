             JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the second-
biggest U.S. bank, said it bought back $500 million in shares
through yesterday after receiving approval from regulators to
return some capital to shareholders.  
 JPMorgan bought back $135 million through the end of the
second quarter and the rest of the shares this month,
 Michael Cavanagh , the New York-based company’s chief executive
officer for Treasury and Security Services, told journalists on
a conference call today.  
 “You can assume that we don’t do that without consulting
with our regulators,” Cavanagh told reporters on a  conference
call  after the company reported a 76 percent increase in net
income to $4.8 billion for the second quarter. “It’s a small
amount of buyback activity and I wouldn’t draw too many
conclusions from that other than yes, in fact, it’s been a while
and we’re back with some degree of activity.”  
 U.S. banks, which were directed to raise capital and
restrict dividends following the worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression, have been hesitant to return that money to
shareholders. Dimon said last month that it may be “too
ambitious” to expect a  dividend  increase by the end of the
year. Share repurchases may come first because they don’t have
to be sustained like a dividend boost.  
 Excess Capital  
 “JPMorgan has excess capital that needs to be put to work
for shareholders,” Portales Partners analyst  Charles Peabody 
said in a July 13 note to clients.  
 The company said it had $108.2 billion in Tier 1 regulatory
capital, or 9.6 percent of assets, at the end of the second
quarter.  
 “The fact that they were actually able to buy stock back
is pretty spectacular,” said  Anton Schutz , who manages $250
million in financial stock, including JPMorgan, at Mendon
Capital Advisors Corp. in Rochester, New York. “The fact that
they were able to do it not only said a lot about their
confidence, but a lot about regulators allowing them to.”

                          July 15 (Bloomberg) -- Anton Schutz, president of Mendon Capital Advisors Corp., discusses JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s announcement that it bought back $500 million in shares through yesterday.
     JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said second-quarter profit rose 76 percent, more than analysts estimated, as a reduction in provisions for soured mortgages and credit-card loans buoyed results. Schutz speaks with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television’s “InsideTrack.” (This is an excerpt of the full interview. Source: Bloomberg)
