             Former Bank of England policy maker
 David Blanchflower  said the risk of a deflation “nightmare”
means officials including Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  should keep stimulus in place until there’s more
evidence that private companies are spending again.  
 “Deflation is Ben Bernanke’s and my nightmare,”
Blanchflower said in an interview with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg
Radio. Most of the global economic recovery “is being driven by
stimulus,” he said. “Caution to you if you start to take it
off.”  
 Fed policy makers last month cut their outlook for
inflation this year to a range of 1.0 percent to 1.1 percent,
down from 1.2 percent to 1.5 percent in April, according to
minutes released this week. Some policy makers expressed concern
about “some risk of deflation,” and officials saw no need to
boost stimulus, the minutes showed.  
 “The Fed has it right in its minutes, evidence recently
looks like the global economy maybe has reached a turning point
and it’s hard to see much evidence that the private sector is
hiring or investing,” Blanchflower said.  
 Fed policy makers last month restated a pledge to keep the
 benchmark  lending rate at around zero for “an extended
period.” That kind of action has helped avoid another Great
Depression, Blanchflower said.  
 “The folks who say the stimulus hasn’t worked don’t
understand the scale of the shock,” he said. “The crisis was
really very deep and the stimulus, monetary, fiscal and rescuing
the banks, are what prevented us going back to the Great
Depression, back to unemployment rates of 25 percent.”  
 Blanchflower’s three-year term at the Bank of England ended
in March 2009, and he is now an economics professor at Dartmouth
College in Hanover, New Hampshire. He writes a column for
Bloomberg News.
