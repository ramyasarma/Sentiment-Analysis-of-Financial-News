             The dollar may fall to this year’s
low of about 85 yen as ichimoku analysis shows bearish signals,
Ueda Harlow Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  
 The greenback’s weekly and daily ichimoku charts reveal its
short-term conversion line is below the longer-term baseline,
and the currency is also lower than the bottom of the so-called
cloud, both of which indicate the currency is likely to weaken,
said  Toshiya Yamauchi , a senior analyst at the online currency-
trading company in Tokyo.  
 The dollar is initially poised to drop to 86.97 yen, where
it began this month’s rally, and if it “fails to protect this
key resistance level, it may then extend its decline to 85
yen,” Yamauchi said today in an interview.  
 The dollar traded at 87.46 yen as of 8:21 a.m. in Tokyo,
having risen from this year’s low of 86.97 on July 1. The U.S.
currency has lost six percent against the yen this year.  
 The greenback’s conversion line on a weekly ichimoku chart
is at 90.31 yen and the baseline is 90.98. On a daily chart, its
conversion line is 88.09 yen, below the baseline of 89.55.  
 “Should the dollar manage to remain above resistance
around this year’s low, this may create a so-called double-
bottom pattern and enable it to rebound into the lower part of
the ichimoku cloud,” Yamauchi said.  
 Ichimoku analysis, developed by Japanese journalist Goichi
Hosoda starting in the 1940s, is used to predict a currency’s
direction through analyzing the midpoints of historical highs
and lows. The conversion line plots the sum of the highest high
and lowest low over the last nine trading days. The baseline is
the same calculation over the past 26 days.  
 A cloud refers to the area between the first and second
leading span lines on the chart and is used to show an area
where buy orders may be clustered.  
 A double bottom forms when a currency makes two consecutive
troughs of about the same depth, and indicates it may be poised
to rally.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
