             Baidu Inc. , operator of China’s
biggest Internet search engine, said it plans to add 200
engineers in Shanghai to boost its technology research.  
 The proposed hirings are part of “a continuous process”
of bolstering research and development, Kaiser Kuo, Baidu’s
spokesman in Beijing, said by phone today. The company has about
80 engineers in Shanghai at present, Kuo said.  
 Baidu seeks to maintain its lead in the world’s biggest
Internet market after main rival  Google Inc.  last week secured
its operating license from the Chinese government, defusing a
six-month dispute with regulators on Web censorship. The
Beijing-based company recently boosted efforts to hire engineers
from the U.S., according to Kuo.  
 The Chinese company’s main research center will remain in
Beijing, where it has more than 2,000 engineers, Kuo said.  
 Baidu had 64 percent of the Internet search market in China
in the first quarter, expanding from 58.4 percent three months
earlier, according to research company Analysys International.
Google’s market share fell to 30.9 percent from 35.6 percent,
according to Analysys.
