             Yuan forwards weakened, retreating
from a three-week high, on speculation policy makers will limit
currency appreciation to support exports as the economy slows.  
 China’s  economic growth  eased to 10.3 percent in the second
quarter, from an 11.9 percent pace in the previous three months,
the statistics bureau said today.  Industrial production  in June
rose 13.7 percent from a year earlier, following a 16.5 percent
gain in May, and inflation cooled to 2.9 percent from 3.1
percent. Government bonds halted a three-day advance.  
 “The economy is already on a slowdown trend,” said  Guan Jiaying , an analyst in Beijing at China Citic Bank Co., a unit
of China’s biggest state investment company. “To boost economic
growth, the authorities won’t allow the yuan to gain much this
year.”  
 Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1 percent to
6.6636 per dollar as of 5:46 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting bets
the currency will appreciate 1.7 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reached 6.6550 yesterday,
the strongest level since June 24.  
 China’s managed float of the yuan’s exchange rate will help
curb inflation and ease asset bubbles, central bank Deputy
Governor Hu Xiaolian,  said  in a statement on the monetary
authority’s website today.  
 The yuan may appreciate 1.2 percent to 6.7 by the end of
this year, after strengthening 0.7 percent since a two-year-old
peg to the dollar ended on June 19, said China Citic’s Guan.  
 Dollar Demand  
 The currency’s spot rate declined 0.06 percent to 6.7785,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. That was
the biggest drop since July 6.  
 “Today’s data may have caused an increase in demand for
dollars because the slowdown means yuan appreciation will
decelerate and even stop from time to time,” said  Liu Dongliang ,
a Shenzhen-based analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the
country’s fifth-largest lender by market value.  
 Government bonds due in six years and less were little
changed as demand rose at a central bank bill auction.  
 The People’s Bank of China gauged appetite for the
securities by asking banks to submit orders before announcing a
record sale amount of 160 billion yuan ($23.6 billion) of  three-
year bills  yesterday.  
 “Rumors about the June figures were spread two days ago,”
said  Chen Liang , a fixed-income analyst with Guohai Securities
Co. in Shenzhen. “Investors showed enormous demand for the
central bank bills, predicting a possible decline in yield.”  
 Cash Shortage Eased  
 The bills were sold today at a lower yield for the first
time since June 3, on rising demand from finance companies after
a cash shortage eased. The interest rate dropped three basis
points to 2.65 percent, from the last sale two weeks ago.  
 The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures funding
availability between banks, slid 45 basis points this week to
1.87 percent, according to a daily fixing published by the
National Interbank Funding Center. The rate declined to 1.8
percent yesterday, the lowest level since May 20. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  
 The yield on the 2.33 percent government note due in June
2013 was 2.31 percent, and the price of the security was 100.05
per 100 yuan face amount, according to the funding center data.
