Axel Krieger does not wish to extend his contract and will leave
the company by the end of the year, a spokesman confirmed.  
 Krieger gave “personal reasons” for his decision to leave
upon the expiry of his contract, spokesman Andreas Neumann said
in a telephone interview. An insider trading case that led to
Krieger’s earlier conviction on insider trading charges is
“definitely not the reason” for the departure, Neumann said.
