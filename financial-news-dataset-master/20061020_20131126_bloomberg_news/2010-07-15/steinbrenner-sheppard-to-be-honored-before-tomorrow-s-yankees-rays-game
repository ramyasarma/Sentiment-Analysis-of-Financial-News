             George Steinbrenner  and  Bob Sheppard 
will be honored by the New York Yankees today prior to the
team’s first game since they died.  
 The Yankee Stadium tribute before the game against the
Tampa Bay Rays will commemorate the lives of Steinbrenner, the
team’s owner who died three days ago at the age of 80, and
Sheppard, the former public-address announcer who passed away
July 11 at 99, the team said in a news release.  
 The Yankees have asked fans to be in their seats at 6:45
p.m. for the ceremony, which will include a video tribute to
Steinbrenner and a moment of silence for both men. Game time is
7:05 p.m.  
 Plans for further tributes for Steinbrenner and Sheppard,
the team’s PA announcer from 1951 through 2007, will be revealed
during today’s event.  
 Another ceremony will be held tomorrow during the team’s
Old-Timers’ Day. A video tribute to Sheppard will precede the
introduction of more than 64 former Yankee players and coaches.
There will also be a performance to recognize Sheppard during
the seventh-inning stretch.  
 The Yankees announced three days ago that patches
commemorating Steinbrenner and Sheppard will be worn on team
uniforms the rest of the season.
