             JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, said today the company’s average
daily risk-taking in commodities fell 9 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier.  
 Value-at-risk  in commodity prices, a measure of how much
the firm estimates it might lose in a single day, fell to $20
million in the second quarter from $22 million in the same
quarter last year, the company said. The bank’s value at risk in
“commodities and other” was $15 million in the first quarter
of 2010.  
 The bank today reported that profit rose 76 percent, more
than analysts estimated, as a reduction in provisions for soured
mortgages and credit-card loans buoyed results.  
 Net income  climbed to $4.8 billion, or $1.09 a share, from
$2.72 billion, or 28 cents, a year earlier and from $3.33
billion in the first quarter, the New York-based company said
today in a statement. The per-share earnings compared with an
average estimate for adjusted earnings of 71 cents projected by
22 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg .
