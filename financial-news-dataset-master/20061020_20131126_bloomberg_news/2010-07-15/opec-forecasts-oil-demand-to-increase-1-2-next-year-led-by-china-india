             The  Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries  forecast that global oil demand will grow in
2011 at about the same rate as this year, led by developing
economies such as China and India.  
 Worldwide crude oil consumption will increase by 1.05
million barrels a day, or 1.2 percent, next year to average
86.41 million barrels a day, the organization’s Vienna-based
secretariat said today in its first assessment for 2011. This
year OPEC predicts demand will grow 950,000 barrels a day, or
1.1 percent driven by countries outside the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.  
 “The global economic recovery, which is expected to start
during the second half of 2010, is projected to continue through
the whole of 2011,” OPEC said in the Monthly Oil Market Report.
“As in the current year, next year’s oil demand growth will
take place in the non-OECD, mainly China, India, the Middle East
and Latin America.”  
 Crude demand is recovering around the world from a two-year
slump, the steepest since the 1980s, triggered by the financial
crisis and ensuing recession. Oil futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange traded close to $77 a barrel today following
a 78 percent rebound last year.  
 OPEC, responsible for 40 percent of global oil output, is
anticipating less demand growth next year than the adviser to
consuming OECD nations, the  International Energy Agency . Two
days ago, the Paris-based IEA forecast that oil usage will
advance 1.3 million barrels, or 1.6 percent, to 87.8 million a
day in 2011.  
 Non-OPEC Supply  
 OPEC predicted that producers outside the group will expand
their supplies in 2011 by less than this year’s shipments. Non-
OPEC suppliers will increase output by 300,000 barrels a day to
52.2 million a day, the organization said. That’s down from
forecast growth for this year of 700,000 barrels a day.  
 As a result, the world’s need for crude from OPEC will
increase. OPEC expects it will need to pump an average of 28.8
million barrels a day in 2011 to balance supply and demand, or
200,000 a day more than this year.  
 OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The organization’s next meeting is
scheduled for Oct. 14 in Vienna.
