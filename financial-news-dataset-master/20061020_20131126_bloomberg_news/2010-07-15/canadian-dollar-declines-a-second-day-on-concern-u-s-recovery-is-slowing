             Canada’s dollar weakened for a
second consecutive day as evidence of a slowing economic
recovery in the U.S., the nation’s largest trading partner,
reduced prospects for exporters.  
 The loonie dropped against most of its major counterparts
including the euro and pound as regional reports indicating a
slowdown in American manufacturing underscored the Federal
Reserve’s lowered forecasts for economic growth and inflation.  
 “Our association with the U.S. and the U.S. economy is
starting to hurt us,”  Firas Askari , head currency trader in
Toronto at Bank of Montreal, Canada’s fourth-largest lender,
said in an e-mail message. “The Canadian dollar is getting
beaten up on the crosses.”  
 The Canadian currency slid 0.6 percent to C$1.0389 per U.S.
dollar at 4 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0327 yesterday. It touched
C$1.0277 on July 13, the strongest level since June 23. One
Canadian dollar buys 96.25 U.S. cents.  
 The New York Fed’s general economic index and the
Philadelphia Fed’s gauge both fell in July to 5.1, reflecting
the slowest pace of manufacturing expansion this year. Readings
greater than zero signal growth. A report from the Labor
Department showed U.S. producer prices slid 0.5 percent last
month after a 0.3 percent decrease in May.  
 Crude oil, Canada’s largest export, fell 0.4 percent to
$76.75 a barrel after earlier tumbling 2.2 percent. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1 percent after earlier falling 1.3
percent. The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, tends to rise and
fall with stocks and raw-materials prices.  
 Bank of Canada  
 Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  became on June 1 the
first Group of Seven central banker to lift  borrowing costs  when
he increased the target lending rate to 0.50 percent from a
record low 0.25 percent. Policy makers next meet July 20.  
 “Expectations have really rebounded,”  Sacha Tihanyi , a
currency strategist in Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia
Capital, said by phone from Toronto, referring to next week’s
decision. “We basically have a 25 basis point hike priced in.”  
 The  yield  on Canada’s two-year bond dropped 5 basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.66 percent as the 2 percent
security maturing in September 2012 rose 10 cents to C$100.71.  
 The loonie is trading in a range capped by the 100-day
moving average of C$1.0295, Tihanyi said. It appreciated to
C$1.0284 today before erasing the advance.
