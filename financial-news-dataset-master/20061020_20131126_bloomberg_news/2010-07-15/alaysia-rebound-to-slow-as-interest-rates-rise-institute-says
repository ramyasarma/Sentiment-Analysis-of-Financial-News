             Malaysia’s economic rebound is set
to slow in the second half of this year after its central bank
raised interest rates for a third time, the Malaysian Institute
of Economic Research predicts.  
 “Economic growth is expected to taper off in the second
half of 2010 due to further policy tightening measures and
disappearing low-base effects,” the institute said in a report
released in Kuala Lumpur today.  
 Southeast Asia’s third-largest  economy  may expand 6.5
percent this year and 5.2 percent in 2011, the partially
government-funded research group said. The institute raised its
2010 forecast from 5.2 percent after gross domestic product
jumped 10.1 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter
following last year’s recession.  
 The country’s central bank raised its benchmark overnight
policy rate to 2.75 percent on July 8, judging the monetary
stance to be supportive of the economy, even as threats to the
global recovery have appeared. Malaysia’s rebound may slow in
the second half of the year because of “external factors,”
Prime Minister  Najib Razak  said last week.  
 Exports by companies such as Sime Darby Bhd. and Unisem (M)
Bhd. rose at the slowest pace in three months in May as sales to
Europe and China eased.  
 Malaysia’s inflation rate is forecast at 2.2 percent in
2010, the research institute said today. MIER expects the
overnight policy rate to settle at 2.75 percent by end-2010 and
increase to 3.25 percent in 2011, driven by firmer economic
expansion.  
 Consumer prices  climbed 1.6 percent in May from a year
earlier, the fastest pace in a year, as food and transport costs
rose with the strengthening economy.
