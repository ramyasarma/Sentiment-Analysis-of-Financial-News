             The U.S. Senate will vote today to
close debate on the financial-regulation bill, the last step
before seeking final passage of the biggest rewrite of Wall
Street rules since the Great Depression.  
 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said
lawmakers will vote at about 11 a.m. Washington time on a
procedural motion that would clear the path for final action as
early as today. Senate approval would send the bill to President
 Barack Obama  to be signed into law.  
 “This bill is a response to the failure of our financial
regulatory system to protect ordinary families from the
consequences of others’ bad decisions,” Senate Banking
Committee Chairman  Christopher Dodd , a Connecticut Democrat who
helped write the bill, said yesterday on the Senate floor.  
 Senate approval of legislation would represents a victory
for Obama, who proposed the regulatory overhaul in response to
the 2008 financial crisis that led the U.S. to provide $700
billion in bailout funds for companies including New York-based
insurer  American International Group Inc.   
 The House of Representatives approved the bill on June 30.
