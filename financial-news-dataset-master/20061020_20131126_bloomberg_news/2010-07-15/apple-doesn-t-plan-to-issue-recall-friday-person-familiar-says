             Apple Inc. , facing complaints over
the antenna reception of its new iPhone 4, doesn’t plan to
announce a recall for the product at a press event tomorrow,
according to a person familiar with the company’s plans.  
 The event, slated for 10 a.m. local time at Apple’s
Cupertino, California, headquarters, will center on the iPhone,
though no recall is planned, said the person, who asked not to
be named because the information isn’t public. Apple has
declined to elaborate on what will be discussed.  
 Since Apple released the iPhone 4 on June 24, users have
complained about losing reception when they cover the lower-left
corner of the device. Consumer Reports said this week it
wouldn’t recommend the phone because of the glitch, and some
analysts have said Apple needs to address the concerns or risk
harming sales.  
 Paddy Power Plc, Ireland’s biggest bookmaker, said this
week that the odds of a recall increased after the Consumer
Reports review, leading to a “betting frenzy.” The iPhone, first
introduced in 2007, is Apple’s top-selling product, accounting
for about 40 percent of revenue. The company sold 1.7 million in
the first three days after the release of the fourth-generation
model. Apple reports earnings on July 20.  
 The latest model has a new design that encases the antenna
in a metal band surrounding the phone, instead of making it a
separate piece. In response to the complaints, Apple has advised
users to either not touch the phone in the lower-left corner or
use a case.  
 Apple  fell $1.24 to $251.49 at 3:42 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The  shares  had risen 20 percent
this year before today.

                          July 15 (Bloomberg) -- Dan McGinn, chief executive officer at TMG Strategies, talks about the antenna design in Apple Inc.'s iPhone 4.
     Apple’s senior antenna expert voiced concern to Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs in the early design phase of the iPhone 4 that the antenna design could lead to dropped calls, a person familiar with the matter said. McGinn speaks with Scarlet Fu on Bloomberg Television's "InBusiness With Margaret Brennan." (Source: Bloomberg)
