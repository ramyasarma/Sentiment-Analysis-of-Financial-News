             Sugar prices may rise, extending
their second straight monthly rally, on speculation that global
production is lagging behind demand.  
 Five of nine traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast that raw-sugar futures will advance next
week. One predicted the price will be flat, and three said it
will fall. Raw sugar has gained 4.7 percent this week to 17.39
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, boosting the gain
for July to 8.3 percent.  
 Five of nine respondents predicted that white-sugar futures
traded on London’s Liffe exchange will gain, and four said the
price will fall. The most-active contract rose 2.5 percent to
$528.50 a metric ton this week, up 13 percent for the month.  
 “Supplies from Brazil may decline while global demand
continues to remain strong,” said  Bruno Zaneti , a risk-
management consultant at FCStone Group in Campinas, Brazil.  
 Four of eight respondents said the refined sweetener’s
premium over raw sugar will widen, and three forecast a drop.
One expected no change.  
 The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish predictions for raw
sugar, with readings above zero signaling that most respondents
expect higher prices. The green line shows raw-sugar prices,
while the blue line tracks prices for white sugar. The figures
are through July 9.  

 
Bullish on raw sugar: 5       Bearish: 3    Neutral: 1
Bullish on refined sugar: 5   Bearish: 4    Neutral: 0
Widening refined premium: 4   Narrow: 3     Neutral: 1
