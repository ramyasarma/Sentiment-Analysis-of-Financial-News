             Asahi Breweries Ltd. will sell beer
in Malaysia through Carlsberg A/S’s sales network, Nikkei
English News said, without citing anyone. Asahi already sells
beer in Hong Kong through the Danish brewer’s network, the
report said.  
 Separately, Asahi will outsource sales and production of
tea beverages in Taiwan through an alliance with Mercuries and
Associates Ltd., the report said.
