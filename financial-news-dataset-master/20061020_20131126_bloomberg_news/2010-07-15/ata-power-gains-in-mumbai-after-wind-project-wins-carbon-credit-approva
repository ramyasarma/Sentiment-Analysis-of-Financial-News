             Tata Power Co. , India’s largest non-
state generator, rose in Mumbai after its wind project won
eligibility from the United Nations to earn carbon credits.  
 The  shares  gained as much as 1.2 percent to 1,342.95 rupees
and traded at 1,333.9 rupees, up 0.5 percent, as of 12:23 p.m.
local time. The benchmark  Sensitive Index  fell 0.3 percent.  
 “Carbon credits add straight to the bottom line,” said
 Mehul Mukati , a Mumbai-based analyst with Ambit Capital Pvt.
“This shows the potential” of Tata Power’s renewable energy
plans, he said.  
 The 50-megawatt wind power project at Khandke in
Maharashtra state, was registered with the UN Clean Development
Mechanism, Tata Power said in a statement yesterday. The CDM is
the world’s largest carbon market after the European Union
program.  
 The venture is expected to earn 85,000 Certified Emission
Reductions annually, Tata Power said. If awarded, those CERs
would be valued at 1 million euros ($1.27 million) based on
yesterday’s closing benchmark price of 11.95 euros a metric ton
of carbon dioxide on the European Climate Exchange in London.  
 Tata Power plans to expand the amount of power it generates
from clean sources by as much as 16-fold to 10,000 megawatts in
four years, it said on June 28.
