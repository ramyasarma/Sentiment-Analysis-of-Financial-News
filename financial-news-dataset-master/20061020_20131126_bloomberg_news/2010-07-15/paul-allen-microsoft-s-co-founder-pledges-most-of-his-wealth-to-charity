             Paul Allen ,  Microsoft Corp. ’s co-
founder, has pledged to give a majority of his wealth to charity
after his death.  
 Allen made the announcement in response to a campaign by
Microsoft co-founder  Bill Gates  and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 
Chairman  Warren Buffett  to persuade other American billionaires
to donate at least half of their fortunes. Allen said in a
statement that it has been his plan for years to leave the
majority of his estate to philanthropy.  
 Allen, 57, has made more than $1 billion in donations,
including $400 million in grants given by the 20-year-old Paul
G. Allen Family Foundation. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft in
1975 and invested in technology companies like Charter
Communications Inc., is the 37th richest man in the world, with
$13.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine.  
 Allen in November was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
and began chemotherapy.  
 “Paul has finished his treatments and as of now has no
current medical issues,” David Postman, a spokesman for Vulcan
Inc., Allen’s investment group, said in an e-mail. “He’s been
working hard, as he has throughout the year.”  
 St. Louis-based cable operator Charter emerged from
bankruptcy last year. Among Allen’s other holdings are the
Seattle Seahawks football team and the Portland Trail Blazers
basketball team. Allen also backed a Seattle music and science-
fiction museum, housed in a  Frank Gehry -designed building.  
 Buffett and Gates, two of the world’s three richest men,
and Gates’ wife, Melinda, started their campaign called “The
Giving Pledge” on June 16.
