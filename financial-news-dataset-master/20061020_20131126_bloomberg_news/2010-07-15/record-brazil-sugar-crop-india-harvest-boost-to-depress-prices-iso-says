             Sugar output in Brazil and India
will expand in the year starting October, which will likely
“put pressure” on prices, according to the executive director
of the  International Sugar Organization .  
 Brazil, the largest grower, may produce a record crop of
about 41 million metric tons in the 2010-2011 year, compared
with 36 million tons in the current season,  Peter Baron  said in
an interview in Bali, Indonesia.  
 India, the second-largest grower, may produce about 26
million tons next year and export about 500,000 tons, Baron said
on the sidelines of the 16th Asia International Sugar Conference.  
 Raw sugar prices in New York may extend this year’s 37
percent loss as output in India will likely exceed a government
forecast on an increase in plantation area. The country may
return to the export market next year after being a net buyer
since 2008, Baron said.  
 “We may start to see price pressure in October, but not a
dramatic pressure,” he said.  
 Production in China will probably increase by 20 percent to
15 million tons, Baron said. Still, the country may need to
import as much as 2 million tons next season, he said.  
 Raw-sugar prices may tumble to between 13 cents and 15
cents a pound during October to December as expanding harvests
from India and Brazil swell supplies and the global market
shifts to a surplus,  Stefan Uhlenbrock , an analyst at Ratzeburg,
Germany-based researcher F.O. Licht, said on July 12.  
 The ISO narrowed its sugar deficit forecast this year to 8
million tons, from 8.5 million tons projected earlier, because
of the “accumulation of small changes,” Baron said. Global
production in the year ending September is estimated at 158.9
million tons and total consumption is expected to be 166.9
million tons, he said.  
 Depleting Stocks  
 The organization maintained its forecast of the 2010-2011
global sugar surplus at 2.5 million tons, on total output of 172
million to 173 million tons. The forecast “is subject to change
but not dramatically,” depending on the monsoon in India and
rains in Brazil, Baron said. Official production estimates will
be released in August.  
 Czarnikow Group Ltd. , the London-based broker, said June 3
that sugar supplies will outpace demand by 2.5 million tons in
the 12 months ending September 2011, while Fortis Bank Nederland
and VM Group estimated supply will exceed production by 5.64
million tons in the 2010-2011 season.  
 “The surplus will not impact the market too negatively as
many countries need to fill up stocks,” said Baron. Inventory
replenishing will probably take place when prices are near 14 to
15 cents, he said.  
 Ending stockpiles for the year 2009-2010 are estimated to
be 52.8 million tons of raw sugar value, compared with 60.7
million tons a year earlier, according to ISO’s May report.  
 “The market is at a relatively healthy stage,” Baron said.
