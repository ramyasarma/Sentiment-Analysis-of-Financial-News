             Inpex Corp. , operator of the
proposed Ichthys natural gas project in northern Australia, said
it expects the venture to contribute A$3.5 billion ($3.1
billion) a year to the nation’s gross domestic product.  
 Construction of the $20 billion development will last five
to six years once Inpex and partner  Total SA  decide to
proceed with the plan, Japan’s largest energy explorer said in
an environmental impact  statement  today.  
 Ichthys, among more than a dozen planned liquefied natural
gas projects in Australia aimed at tapping growing Asian demand
for cleaner-burning fuel, is designed to produce 8.4 million
metric tons of LNG a year, Inpex said. The Tokyo-based company
in May delayed a final investment decision until as late as the
fourth quarter of 2011, without giving a reason.  
 Inpex intends a $6.6 billion share sale to finance
the project, it said this month. Inpex fell to a record low in
Tokyo after announcing the plan.  
 A public comment period for the environmental impact
statement closes Sept. 10, according to the documents released
today. Approvals from both Australian and Northern Territory
regulators are needed before the venture can go ahead.  
 The Australian government has deferred by three months
until October decisions on whether to approve LNG projects
proposed by  Santos Ltd.  and BG Group Plc. While Queensland state
cleared the ventures, it raised concerns about their
environmental impact.
