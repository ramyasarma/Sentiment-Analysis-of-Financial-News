             Thompson Creek Metals Co. , the
operator of two molybdenum mines in North America, agreed to
acquire  Terrane Metals Corp.  for about C$650 million ($623.5
million) to diversify into copper and gold.  
 Thompson Creek will pay 90 Canadian cents in cash and 0.052
of its shares for each share of Terrane, Thompson Creek said
today in a statement. Goldcorp Inc. which holds a 52 percent
stake in Vancouver-based Terrane on a fully diluted basis,
agreed to vote in favor of the deal, Thompson Creek said.  
 Terrane owns the Mt. Milligan copper and gold mine project
in British Columbia. Thompson Creek said it agreed to sell 25
percent of Mt. Milligan’s life-of-mine gold output to Royal Gold
Inc. for cash payments totaling $311.5 million.
