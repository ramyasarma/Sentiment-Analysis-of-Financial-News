             There is “less than a 50-50”
chance Congress will approve the $11.6 billion in extra federal
Medicaid assistance U.S. states have included in their current
budgets,  Pennsylvania  Governor  Ed Rendell  said today.  
 Rendell, 66, called the denial of funding “a disaster” in
an interview with  Erik Schatzker  on Bloomberg Television’s
InsideTrack today. He said he spoke about the issue last night
with Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat.  
 Faced with concern that the federal deficit is swelling,
the Senate twice has failed to generate the 60 votes needed to
bring the proposal to a vote. The loss of the extended Medicaid
funding will cost more than 200,000 government jobs, according
to  Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody’s Analytics Inc.  
 In Pennsylvania, Rendell said 20,000 teachers, police and
government workers will be fired if the $848 million in extra
federal aid included in his $28 billion budget isn’t approved.  
 “We’re seeing real momentum starting to build” in
Pennsylvania’s economy, Rendell said today, citing 80,000 new
jobs created in his state this year. “It would be a disaster
not to do this.”  
 Pennsylvania, the sixth-most-populous U.S. state, is among
31 states that included money from the federal government’s
proposed six-month extension of enhanced Medicaid aid in their
current budgets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 California , which along with Illinois is the state with the
lowest credit rating from Moody’s, is counting on the most, $1.7
billion, state budget documents show.
