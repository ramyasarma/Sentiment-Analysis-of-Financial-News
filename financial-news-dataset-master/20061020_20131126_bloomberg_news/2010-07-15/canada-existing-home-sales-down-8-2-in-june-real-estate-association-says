             Canadian existing home sales fell
8.2 percent in June from May on a seasonally adjusted basis as
the country’s housing market continues to cool, according to a
release from the Canadian Real Estate Association.  
 The number of homes sold dropped to 33,959 units, from
37,005 units in May, CREA said in the release from Ottawa today.
The value of home sales dropped 10.5 percent to C$11.3 billion
($10.9 billion), the association said.  
 “The June report was weak no matter how you slice it,”
 Pascal Gauthier , an economist with Toronto-Dominion Bank, said
in a note to clients. “But it comes as no surprise that the
housing market continued cooling from the record levels of
activity established last year.”  
 The Bank of Canada  predicted in April  that housing will
“weaken markedly through the remainder of 2010 and well into
2011.” The central bank said housing will contribute 0.6
percentage point to growth this year and cut 0.1 point from next
year’s expansion.  
 The real estate group cited tighter regulations for
mortgage insurance and “anticipated interest rate increases”
as factors causing the decline.  
 Sales were 20 percent lower than in June 2009, with drops
of 35 percent in Alberta and 23 percent in British Columbia, the
group also said.  
 New listings fell 6.8 percent to 70,401 units in June from
May, the realtor group said. The average price for a home in
Canada was C$342,662 in June, an increase of 4.9 percent from a
year earlier.
