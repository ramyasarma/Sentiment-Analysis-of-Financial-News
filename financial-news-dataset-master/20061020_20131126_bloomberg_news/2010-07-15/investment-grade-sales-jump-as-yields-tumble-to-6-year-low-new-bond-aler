             Corporate bond issuance surged to
nearly $8 billion yesterday as yields on investment-grade debt
fell to the least since April 2004.  
 Companies sold $7.9 billion of notes bringing the week’s
total to $20 billion, up from $12.3 billion in the similar
period the previous week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Investment-grade issuers dominated the day’s sales,
accounting for $6.9 billion of volume.  
 It was the third straight day of more than $4 billion bond
sales as spreads relative to Treasuries narrowed and absolute
yields on investment-grade debt reached the lowest in more than
six years.  
 James Barnes , a fixed-income portfolio manager at
Wyomissing, Pennsylvania-based Investors Trust Co., said the
rising issuance comes amid low yields and rising investor
appetite for risk.  
 “Corporations seem to be taking advantage of the low
yields,” Barnes who manages $1 billion of investment-grade
assets, said in a telephone interview, adding that spread
tightening will depend on economic data and the results of the
European bank stress tests due to be published July 23.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
bonds instead of Treasuries narrowed 2 basis points to 198 basis
points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S.
Corporate Master index. The absolute yield fell 9 basis points
to 4.27 percent, the lowest since April 2004.  
 Qatari Diar Sale  
 Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co. led issuers with a
$3.5 billion debt offering of five- and 10-year notes. It sold
$1 billion of five-year debt that yields 180 basis points more
than Treasuries, and a $2.25 billion 10-year portion pays a 190
basis-point spread, according to a person familiar with the
offering who declined to be identified citing lack of
authorization to discuss the offering.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. , Japan’s  third-largest 
commercial bank, sold $2 billion of debt, split evenly between
three- and five-year notes. The three-year issue yields 118
basis points more than comparable-maturity U.S. Treasuries, and
the five-year debt pays a 137.5 basis-point spread.  
 “Corporations will take advantage when there is calm
in the marketplace, but when events occur that lead to risk
aversion, they tend to stick to the sidelines waiting for the
opportunity to rise again,” said Barnes, adding that he expects
a continuation of the “pattern” of the last three to four
months of low periods of debt issuance followed by spurts of
high volume.  
 Treasury Yields  
 Gary Pollack , head of fixed-income trading and research at
Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth Management unit, said he
expects U.S. Treasury yields, which closed above 3 percent for a
fifth straight day, to rise as investors take on risk.  
 “When there’s an appetite for risky assets, and we think
there will be, yields will rise,” Pollack said during a press
conference at Deutsche Bank’s 280 Park Avenue office in New York
on July 13.  
 Companhia Siderurgica Nacional S.A. , the Brazilian
steelmaker, sold $1 billion of 10-year notes at a 357.7 basis-
point spread in the only high-yield offering to price yesterday.  
 Speculative grade-bond spreads narrowed 2 basis points to
668 basis points yesterday, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II index. High-yield, high-
risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
BBB by Standard & Poor’s. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  
 Following is a description of at least $4.24 billion of
pending sales of dollar-denominated bonds in the U.S.

tsunami killed more than 400 people and caused as much as $30

sheet,  Raghavan Seetharaman  said in a June 16 telephone

statement distributed by PR Newswire. Moody’s Investors Service

meaningfully improves the company’s liquidity position and
provides the company flexibility to reduce debt and manage
through a period of attendance-constraining high unemployment
notwithstanding the increase in cash interest costs resulting
from the refinancing.  
 TITAN INTERNATIONAL INC., the maker of tire and wheel
systems for off-highway equipment, said it plans to sell at
