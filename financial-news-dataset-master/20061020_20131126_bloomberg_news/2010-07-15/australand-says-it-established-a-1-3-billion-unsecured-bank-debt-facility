             Australand Property Group , the
Australian unit of Singapore’s CapitaLand Ltd., agreed to A$1.3
billion ($1.1 billion) in unsecured syndicated bank loans,
replacing A$1.15 billion of secured debt.  
 The new facility includes a A$325 million loan due in June
2012, a A$650 million loan maturing in June 2013 and a A$325
million loan due in June 2014, Australand said in a statement to
the Australian stock exchange today.  
 Pricing is “in line with current market rates and is an
improvement on margins of the replaced facilities,” the company
said in the statement, without elaborating.
