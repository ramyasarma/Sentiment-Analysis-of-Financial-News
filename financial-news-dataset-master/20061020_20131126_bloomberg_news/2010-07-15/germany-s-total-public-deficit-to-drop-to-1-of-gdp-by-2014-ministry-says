             Germany’s Berlin-based government,
the 16 states and municipalities have agreed to reduce their
combined budget deficit to 1 percent of gross domestic by 2014
and comply with European deficit rules by 2012, the Finance
Ministry said today.  
 Germany’s stability council, composed of representatives of
the three layers of state, expects the combined deficit to total
4.5 percent of GDP this year, 4 percent of GDP in 2011 and 3
percent of GDP in 2012, the Finance Ministry said, confirming a
report in the Handelsblatt newspaper.
