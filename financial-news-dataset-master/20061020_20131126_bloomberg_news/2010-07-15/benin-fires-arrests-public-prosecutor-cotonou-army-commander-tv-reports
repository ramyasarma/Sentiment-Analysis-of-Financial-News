             Benin fired and arrested Public
Prosecutor Georges Constant Amoussou and Army Commander Abdel
Aziz Bio Djibril for their involvement in a finance company that
took deposits from people and hasn’t returned funds, Office de
Radiodiffusion et Television reported.  
 Amoussou was dismissed for postponing the arrest of Emile
Tegbenou, the Director General of the company known as ICC
Services, which was set up to provide funds to women who own
small businesses, the Cotonou-based broadcaster reported, citing
the government’s secretary general, Ibrahim Soulemane. Djibril
was accused of helping Tegbenou. Martial Sounton will replace
 Armand Zinzindohoue  as Security Minister after he was dismissed
for receiving money to facilitate ICC Services’ activities,
according to the broadcaster.
