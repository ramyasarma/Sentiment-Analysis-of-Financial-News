             (Corrects earnings rise in first paragraph, year-ago
figures in second.)  
 Marriott International Inc. , the
largest U.S. hotel chain, said second-quarter profit more than
tripled and increased its full-year earnings forecast on
improving travel demand.  
 Net income climbed to $119 million, or 31 cents a share,
from $37 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier, the Bethesda,
Maryland-based company said yesterday in a statement. The
results, for the 12 weeks ended June 18, exceeded the 29-cent
average estimate of 15 analysts in a  Bloomberg survey .
Excluding restructuring costs and other expenses in the year-ago
period, earnings rose 42 percent.  
 The lodging industry has shown signs of recovery after the
U.S. recession crimped travel demand last year. Occupancy in the
top 25 markets rose to 62 percent through May from 58 percent
during the comparable year-earlier period, according to  Smith
Travel Research Inc.  of Hendersonville, Tennessee.  
 “Business and leisure stays at our hotels are trending
up,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  J.W. Marriott Jr. 
said in the statement. “Revenue per available room increased
more than expected in the second quarter and room rates at
company-operated hotels in North America rose for the first time
in nearly two years.”  
 Second-quarter revenue climbed 8.2 percent to $2.77
billion. Revenue per available room, or revpar, rose 7.5 percent
on a constant-dollar basis for company-operated properties in
North America. Outside North America, revpar gained 9.8 percent.  
 Marriott  forecast  2010 earnings of $1.05 to $1.13 a share,
up from an April forecast of 95 cents to $1.05. Nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg had an average estimate of $1.06.  
 Hotel Expansion  
 The company, owner of the upscale JW Marriott Hotels and
luxury Ritz-Carlton lines, expects to open more than 30,000
rooms this year. Its focus is on expanding abroad. The hotelier
plans to add at least 21 hotels in China in the next three years
and double its rooms in Europe to 80,000 by 2015.  
 The second-quarter results were announced after the close
of regular U.S. trading yesterday. Marriott shares rose 29 cents
to $32.16 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Trading of bullish Marriott options rose to a two-month
high before the earnings report.  
 The stock has gained 18 percent this year, trailing a 30
percent advance in the 11-member  Bloomberg Americas Lodging
Index .  
 Marriott is the first major U.S. lodging company to report
quarterly earnings.  Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. ,
the owner of the St. Regis and W hotel brands, is scheduled to
report on July 22.  Wyndham Worldwide Corp.  plans to release
figures on July 28.
