             New Zealand’s dollar extended
declines after a government report showed consumer prices rose
by 0.3 percent in the second quarter, less than economists
estimated, easing pressure on the central bank to raise interest
rates.  
 The so-called kiwi traded at 72.51 U.S. cents as of 10:48
a.m. in Wellington from 72.97 cents yesterday in New York.
