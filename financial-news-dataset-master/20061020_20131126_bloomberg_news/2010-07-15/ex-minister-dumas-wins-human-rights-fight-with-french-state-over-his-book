             France’s former Foreign Minister
 Roland Dumas ’s freedom of expression was breached when he was
fined for comments in his book about corruption linked to
Elf Aquitaine SA, the European Court of Human Rights ruled.  
 The court in Strasbourg, France, today ruled by a majority
of five votes to two that Dumas’s rights to freedom of
expression had been breached.  
 The court today ordered France to pay Dumas 8,000 euros.  
 “Roland Dumas had merely exercised his freedom, as a
former defendant in criminal proceedings, to recount the story
of his own trial,” the court ruled today, according to a
statement. “He had also been careful to put his comments
in context and to explain them.”
