             China needs to follow a managed
float of its exchange rate to aid restructuring, said  Hu Xiaolian , deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China.  
 The policy will help deliver more resources to the service
sector and promote the upgrading of industries, she said in
 comments  posted on the central bank’s website. Lack of
flexibility may trigger a financial crisis, she said.  
 The yuan has strengthened 0.8 percent versus the greenback
since the central bank said on June 19 it would end the yuan’s
two-year peg to the dollar and manage the rate with reference to
a currency basket. China had kept the yuan stable at about 6.83
per dollar since July 2008, having allowed it to gain 21 percent
in the previous three years.  
 A more flexible exchange rate is “a fundamental need for
economic restructuring and optimizing resources allocation,” Hu
said. It will “reduce China’s trade imbalance and excessive
reliance on exports, and help sustain economic growth by relying
more on domestic demand.”  
 Medium-sized and large economies will find it difficult to
sustain a currency peg over the long term and it can cause trade
friction and protectionism, according to the statement.  
 She reiterated the central bank will keep the yuan
“basically stable at a reasonable, balanced level,” and
promote balance in China’s international payments.
