             European stocks fell as the Federal
Reserve’s assessment that the economic outlook has “softened”
and a slowing in China’s growth overshadowed a Spanish
government bond sale that drew increased demand.  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.2 percent to 255.39
at 10:44 a.m. in London.
