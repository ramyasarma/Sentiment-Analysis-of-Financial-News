             Kidnappers of the former Mexican
senator and presidential candidate  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos 
asked his family for a $30 million ransom, newspaper La Jornada
 reported , citing unidentified government security officials.  
 The captors allowed Fernandez, a senior figure in
President  Felipe Calderon ’s National Action Party, to hold a
conversation with members of his family to prove he is alive,
the newspaper said. They threatened to kill him if prosecutors
start a new investigation into the kidnapping, the report said.  
 The article didn’t say how the family responded to the
ransom demand. An assistant to the family’s lawyer, Antonio
Lozano, declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  
 Fernandez was kidnapped May 14. Family members told
officials May 21 that they wanted to conduct negotiations with
the kidnappers without government assistance.
