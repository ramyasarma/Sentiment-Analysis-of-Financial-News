             Mexico’s peso bonds rose for a third
day, pushing yields to a record low, as President  Felipe Calderon  named a new economy minister, fueling speculation the
nation will attempt to lure more foreign investment.  
 The yield on the 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.94 percent at 8:55
a.m. New York time, according to Banco Santander SA, the lowest
level since the security was issued in 2005. The price rose 0.72
centavo to 127.78 centavos on the peso.  
 Calderon named  Bruno Ferrari , the head of Mexico’s
investment promotion authority known as Promexico, to be economy
secretary yesterday.  
 “Since he is coming from Promexico, he is very much
inclined to continue promoting foreign investment in Mexico,”
said  Rafael Camarena , an economist with Banco Santander SA in
Mexico City. “His appointment is causing a nice move.”  
 The peso rose 0.3 percent to 12.6791 per dollar, from
12.7152 yesterday.
