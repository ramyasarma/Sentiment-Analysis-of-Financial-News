             J.  Christopher Flowers , the biggest
shareholder in Japan’s  Shinsei Bank Ltd. , said he is
“committed” to the lender and won’t reduce his stake, after
the stock lost 37 percent in the past two months.  
 “We are committed to seeing Shinsei return to profitable
and successful operations,” Flowers, whose private-equity firm
J.C. Flowers & Co. owns about 29 percent of the bank, said in a
telephone interview today. “We believe that Shinsei has good
momentum for the future, and we are puzzled at the low share
price.”  
 Shinsei shares have  tumbled  since a planned merger with
local rival  Aozora Bank Ltd.  was scrapped on May 14, and as the
bank was forced to replace top executives under pressure from
Japan’s financial regulator. Flowers, who first invested in
Shinsei in 2000, said speculation he plans to sell some of his
shares is “completely false.”  
 “We have not sold shares in Shinsei and have no plans to
do so,” said Flowers, who is also a director on Shinsei’s board.  
 Shigeki Toma , who  replaced   Masamoto Yashiro  as chief
executive officer last month, has said he may raise as much as
100 billion yen ($1.1 billion) by selling shares. Flowers
declined to comment on the offering or say whether his firm
would participate.  
 Shinsei is the biggest decliner on the  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average  in the past month, reaching an all-time low of 63 yen in
Tokyo trading yesterday. The bank has  forecast  a profit of 12.5
billion yen for the year ending March 31, 2011.
