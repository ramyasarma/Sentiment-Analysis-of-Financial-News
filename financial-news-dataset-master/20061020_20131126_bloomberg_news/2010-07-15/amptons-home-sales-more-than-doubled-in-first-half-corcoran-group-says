             Home sales in the Hamptons, the
beachside resort towns favored by celebrities and Wall Street
financiers, more than doubled in the first half of 2010 from a
year earlier, according to property broker  Corcoran Group .  
 Sales  in 15 New York villages and hamlets that make up the
Hamptons rose to 923 homes from 433, Corcoran said in a report
today. The dollar volume of all transactions more than doubled
to $1.5 billion, while the median price of homes sold climbed 34
percent to $935,000.  
 “We’ve returned to a fairly healthy normal market,” Rick
Hoffman, a Corcoran senior vice president who oversees sales on
Long Island’s East End, said in a telephone interview. “We’re
seeing the seasonality that we usually experience.”  
 Wall Street hiring and bonuses sparked confidence in would-
be buyers, Hoffman said. New York’s financial companies added
6,800 jobs from the end of February through May, the largest
three-month increase since 2008. The industry’s year-end bonuses
gained an estimated 17 percent to $20.3 billion in 2009,
according to the state comptroller.  
 “People who had been sitting on the sidelines said, ‘You
know what? It’s not going to be the end of the world, lets go
ahead and make this decision,’ ” Hoffman said.  
 The number of homes listed for sale in both the Hamptons
and North Fork of Long Island rose 9.3 percent in the second
quarter to 7,963, Corcoran said. The company didn’t provide
separate home sales numbers for the April through June period.  
 The brokerage’s tally includes single-family home sales as
well as sales of condominiums, Hoffman said.
