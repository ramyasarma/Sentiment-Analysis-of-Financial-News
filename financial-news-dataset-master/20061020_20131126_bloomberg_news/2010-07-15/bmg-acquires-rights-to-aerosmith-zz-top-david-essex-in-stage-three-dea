             BMG Rights Management GmbH, the
music-rights venture owned by  Bertelsmann AG  and  KKR & Co. ,
agreed to buy independent music publisher Stage Three Music, the
companies said in a statement.  
 Stage Three holds the rights to classic songs and writers,
including songs performed by Aerosmith,  David Essex , ZZ Top and
 Macy Gray , according to the company’s  website . BMG said it was
acquiring those rights from Stage Three shareholders Apax
Partners, Ingenious Ventures and company management. Terms of
the deal were not disclosed.  
 Competition is increasing for music publishing catalogs and
the income the lyrics and melodies generate from stores, radio
and Internet play, ads and movies.  
 Unlike recorded music, publishing is buffered from falling
CD sales by its more diverse revenue sources. Owners can earn
cash returns of between 7 and more than 20 percent a year,
depending on the songs and how they’re marketed, investors and
dealmakers said.
