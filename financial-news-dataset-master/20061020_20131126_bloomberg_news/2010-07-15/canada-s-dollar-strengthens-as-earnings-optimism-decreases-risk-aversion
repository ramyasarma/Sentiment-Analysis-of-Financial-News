             Canada’s dollar appreciated versus
its U.S. counterpart after JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s earnings beat
analysts’ estimates, improving the outlook for currencies that
benefit from global growth.  
 “The positive earnings results from JPMorgan have put a
bit more of a friendly tone in the market,”  Sacha Tihanyi , a
currency strategist in Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia
Capital, said by phone from Toronto. “U.S. equity futures are
well off their lows for the day, the S&P 500 has moved
reasonably higher, and currencies are reflecting that. The
Canadian dollar is outperforming other commodity currencies a
little bit on that.”  
 The currency rose 0.2 percent to C$1.0311 per U.S. dollar
at 9:21 a.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0327 yesterday. It reached
C$1.0277 two days ago, the strongest since June 23. One Canadian
dollar buys 96.98 U.S. cents.  
 The Canadian dollar is trading in a range capped by the
100-day moving average of C$1.0295, Tihanyi said.  
 JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, posted a
76 percent rise in quarterly profit to $4.8 billion, or $1.09 a
share, beating an average estimate in a Bloomberg survey for
adjusted earnings of 71 cents.  
 Factory sales increased 0.4 percent to C$44.8 billion
($43.5 billion) in May, the eighth gain in nine months, led by
automobiles and food, and a measure of unsold goods fell to the
lowest level in almost two years, Statistics Canada  said  today
in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted growth of
0.5 percent, according to the median of 18 estimates.  
 Central Bank Decision  
 “Look for the market to test C$1.0250, with a possible
extension towards C$1.0180 to C$1.0200,”  John Curran , a
Toronto-based senior vice president at CanadianForex Ltd., an
online foreign-exchange dealer, wrote in a note to clients.  
 Policy makers meet July 20 to set interest rates. Governor
Mark Carney on June 1 became the first Group of Seven central
banker to lift  borrowing costs  when he increased the bank’s
policy rate to 0.5 percent from a record low 0.25 percent.  
 “Expectations have really rebounded,” said Tihanyi,
referring to next week’s decision. “We basically have a 25-
basis-point hike priced in.”  
 The  yield  on Canada’s two-year bond rose 1 basis point, or
0.01 percentage points, to 1.72 percent as the 2 percent
security due September 2012 fell 2 cents to C$100.58.
