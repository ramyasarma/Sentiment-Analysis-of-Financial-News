             Hennes & Mauritz AB, Europe’s
second-largest clothing retailer, said revenue growth weakened
in the final week of June, causing same-store sales for the
month to miss analysts’ estimates.  
 June sales gained 20 percent, less than the 22 percent rise
that H&M reported last month for the period from June 1 to 22.
The figures exclude currency swings and include value-added tax.  
 Sales at stores open at least a year advanced 9 percent,
Stockholm-based H&M said in a  statement  today. Analysts had
predicted a 9.7 percent rise, according to an SME Direkt survey.  
 The performance was held back by “softer” conditions in
Germany, H&M’s biggest market, in the final week of June, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch analyst  Richard Chamberlain  said in a
note. He has a “neutral” rating on H&M.  
 H&M  fell  as much as 1.50 kronor, or 0.7 percent, to 223.70
kronor in Stockholm trading and was down 0.4 percent as of 9:48
a.m. local time. The shares have risen almost 13 percent this
year, valuing the company at 349 billion kronor ($47.2 billion).  
 Inditex SA is Europe’s largest clothing retailer.
