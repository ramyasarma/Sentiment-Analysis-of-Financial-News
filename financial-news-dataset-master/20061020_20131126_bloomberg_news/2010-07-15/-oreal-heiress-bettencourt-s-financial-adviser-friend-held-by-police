             L’Oreal SA  heiress  Liliane Bettencourt ’s financial adviser Patrick de Maistre, former tax
lawyer Fabrice Goguel and photographer and friend Francois-Marie
Banier are being held for questioning by police over possible
tax evasion by France’s richest woman.  
 Carlos Vejarano, an adviser to Bettencourt and Banier for
their Arros island property, is also being held in connection
with the same investigation, Astrid Granoux, a spokeswoman for
the Nanterre prosecutor’s office, said in a telephone interview.  
 Last month, French website Mediapart published transcripts
of alleged conversations, taped secretly by Bettencourt’s
butler, that suggested she was evading taxes, the online news
service said.
