             Chile must increase hydroelectric
investments and develop renewable energy generation as the
country strives to double capacity in the next decade, President
 Sebastian Pinera  said.  
 Pinera, who took office in March, urged Chile to diversify
its energy sources and reduce its dependence on imports while
protecting the environment. He spoke today in speech marking the
opening of a liquefied natural gas terminal in northern Chile.  
 “We must increase investment in the cleanest energies we
have including hydroelectricity--I’m thinking of the micro,
small and big projects,” Pinera said. “We have to take
advantage of the big projects that nature allows us to build in
Chile.”  
 Chile’s biggest hydroelectric project,  HidroAysen  owned by
 Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA  and Colbun SA, has yet to
receive environmental approval. The $3.2 billion, 2,750 megawatt
project would transport power to the central grid via a 1,900-
kilometer (1,180-mile) transmission line.
