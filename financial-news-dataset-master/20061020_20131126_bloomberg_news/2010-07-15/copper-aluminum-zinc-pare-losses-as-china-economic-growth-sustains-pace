             Copper, aluminum and zinc dropped as
data showed China’s  economic growth  slowed in the second quarter,
signaling a deeper second-half slowdown that may add to risks
for the global economy.  
 Copper for three-month delivery dropped as much as 1.8
percent to $6,603 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before trading at $6,648.50 at 3:32 p.m. in Shanghai. Aluminum
declined 0.5 percent to $1,999.50 a ton and zinc slid 0.8
percent to $1,834.75 a ton.  
 China’s  economic growth  eased to 10.3 percent in the second
quarter and industrial production cooled more than forecast in
June. The pace compares with an 11.9 percent gain in January-
March from a year earlier.  Inflation  cooled to 2.9 percent in
June, the statistics bureau said in Beijing today.  
 “The risk of a slowdown remains,” said Jia Zheng, an
analyst at Orient Securities Futures Co., from Shanghai today.  
 China’s copper production rose 26.3 percent to 422,000 tons
in June, from a year earlier, and zinc output added 15.8 percent
to 425,000 tons, separate data released today showed. Copper
output was a record, according to Jia.  
 “Gains in domestic production offset declines in imports
to a certain extent, showing demand is still robust,” she said.  
 Metals fell also as the Federal Reserve trimmed its growth
forecast and U.S. retail sales declined more than predicted. The
U.S. is the world’s second largest consumer of copper used in
construction and home appliances.  
 U.S. Retail  
 “A slightly weaker-than-expected U.S. retail trade report
softened the macro backdrop,”  Mark Pervan , an analyst at ANZ
Banking Group Ltd. said in an e-mailed report today.  
 “Reports China’s top steel producers had cut August
contract steel prices dulled the mood, particularly for steel
making by-products, nickel and zinc,” Pervan wrote in the
report.  
 Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., the biggest publicly traded
Chinese steelmaker, cut prices for a second month amid weakening
demand, while Angang Steel Co. is considering cuts.  
 Copper and zinc for October delivery in Shanghai were
little changed at 52,870 yuan ($7,804) a ton and 15,125 yuan a
ton, respectively. Nickel in London lost 0.2 percent to $19,360
a ton, lead dropped 1 percent to $1,810 a ton and tin advanced
0.4 percent to $18,045 a ton as of 3:58 p.m. in Shanghai.
