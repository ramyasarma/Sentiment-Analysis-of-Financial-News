             Resona Holdings Inc. , Japan’s
fourth-largest bank, fell in Tokyo trading on speculation the
bank may sell shares to repay government funds.  
 Resona  slumped  as much as 7 percent to 958 yen and traded
at 973 yen in Tokyo, the biggest decline on the Topix Banks
index tracking 83 lenders. The  index  dropped by 1.6 percent.  
 Resona owed the government 2.1 trillion yen ($23.8 billion)
as of March 31 from past bailouts. Chairman Eiji Hosoya said in
May he wants to repay part of the funds by November.  
 “There is a rumor Resona may be trying to raise capital to
pay off the government,” said Ismael Pili, a Tokyo-based
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “The rumor is gaining
momentum.”  
 Masatoyo Miura, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Resona,
declined to comment.
