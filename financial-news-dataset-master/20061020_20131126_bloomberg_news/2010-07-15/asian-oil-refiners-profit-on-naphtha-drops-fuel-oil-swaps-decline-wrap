             Refiners’ profits from producing
naphtha fell on concerns of excess supply as stockpiles
accumulated in the region after the shutdown of a processing
plant in Taiwan.  
 Naphtha’s discount  to Persian Gulf benchmark crude Dubai, a
measure of processing profits known as a crack spread, widened
32 cents to $5.14 a barrel, according to data from broker PVM
Oil Associates at 10:02 a.m. Singapore time. The price
difference was minus $2.89 a month ago. August  swaps  for the
product in Singapore declined 55 cents to $69.11, PVM said.  
 Open-specification naphtha cargoes delivered in the second
half of August were bid at $625 a metric ton against offers at
$628 at 8:38 a.m., data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte show.  
 Naphtha  for delivery to Japan in September closed 2.7
percent higher at $636.50 a ton yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News.  
 Japanese naphtha stockpiles climbed 67,358 kiloliters in
the week ending July 10 to 2.05 million kiloliters, or 13.2
million barrels, the country’s petroleum association reported
yesterday. Singapore supplies rose 0.5 percent in the week to
July 7 to 11.5 million barrels, the highest level since May 5.  
 Supplies are accumulating after a fire caused the shutdown
of Formosa Petrochemical Corp.’s No. 1 naphtha-processing plant
on July 7. The facility, which can process 700,000 tons a year,
may be closed for up to three months.  
 Asian 180-centistoke  fuel oil  swaps for August declined
$2.50, or 0.6 percent, to $453.50 a ton, PVM data showed. The
product’s  discount  to Dubai widened 15 cents to $4.48 a barrel,
PVM said.  
 Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals is offering an 80,000
ton cargo of 380-centistoke fuel for loading on Aug. 20 to Aug.
22 and should be awarded by July 22.  Swaps  for August for the
product dropped 0.6 percent today to $446 a ton.  
 Gasoil  swaps for August in Singapore slumped by 25 cents,
or 0.3 percent, to $86.05 a barrel, PVM data showed. The
product’s  premium  to Dubai slipped 2 cents to $11.80, PVM said.
Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade, rose 5 cents to
$1.05 a barrel, based on PVM data. A widening level indicates
aviation fuel was profitable.
