             China Minmetals Corp. and
Metallurgical Corp. of China Ltd. may be studying the finances
of Indophil Resources NL, the Australian Financial Review
reported, without citing anyone.  
 This follows the decision by Indophil to open a data room
for potential purchasers after Zijin Mining Group Co. withdrew
its A$545 million ($480 million) takeover bid, the newspaper
said in its Street Talk column.
