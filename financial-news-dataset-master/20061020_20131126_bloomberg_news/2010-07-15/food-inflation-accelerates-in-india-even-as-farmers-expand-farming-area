             India’s food inflation accelerated
for the first time in three weeks even as the government
forecast higher production of rice, sugar and oilseeds.  
 An  index  measuring wholesale prices of farm products
compiled by the commerce ministry rose 12.81 percent in the week
to July 3 from a year earlier, according to a statement released
in New Delhi today. It gained 12.63 percent the previous week.  
 Indian farmers planted more rice, oilseeds and sugar cane
as the June-September monsoon rains covered the country nine
days ahead of normal, the farm ministry said this month. Last
year’s rains were the weakest since 1972, stoking food-price
inflation to 21.05 percent in November.  
 “Now that the monsoon rains are good this year, food
inflation will moderate,”  N.R. Bhanumurthy , an economist at the
New Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and Policy,
said before the announcement.  
 India’s benchmark  wholesale-price inflation  jumped 10.55
percent in June from a year earlier on higher consumer demand
for manufactured goods and services, increasing pressure on the
central bank to raise interest rates.  
 Food costs contributed only 28 percent to the June
inflation reading compared with 68 percent in January.  
 The Reserve Bank of India, which has increased rates three
times since mid-March by a quarter-point each, is scheduled to
announce its next monetary policy decision on July 27.
