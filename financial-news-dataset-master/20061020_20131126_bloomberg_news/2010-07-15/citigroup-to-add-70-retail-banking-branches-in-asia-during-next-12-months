             Citigroup Inc. , the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, said it plans to add 70 retail branches in
Asia during the next 12 months.  
 The expansion will increase the number of Citigroup’s
branches by 10 percent to 780, spokesman  James Griffiths  said
today. The Wall Street Journal reported the New York-based
bank’s plans earlier on its website.  
 Citigroup also hopes to announce a partner for an equity
brokerage joint venture in China by yearend, the newspaper
reported, citing an interview with Asia-Pacific Co-Chief
Executive Officer  Stephen Bird .  
 “China is a priority market for Citi globally, and we’ve
said we are actively pursuing a local underwriting license, but
we have no further updates now,” Griffiths said in a telephone
interview from Hong Kong.
