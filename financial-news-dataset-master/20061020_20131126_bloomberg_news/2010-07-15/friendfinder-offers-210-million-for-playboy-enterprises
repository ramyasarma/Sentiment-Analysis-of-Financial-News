             FriendFinder Networks Inc. said it
has made a proposal to acquire Playboy Enterprises Inc. for $210
million, more than a bid by Hugh Hefner, founder of Playboy and
its namesake magazine.  
 Hefner, 84, this week said he wants to take Playboy
private, offering $5.50 apiece in cash for the Class A and Class
B shares he doesn’t already own. That offer is valued at $123
million.  
 FriendFinder disclosed its bid in an e-mailed statement.-
