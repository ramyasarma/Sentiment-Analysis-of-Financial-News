             Microsoft Corp. , the world’s biggest
software maker, dropped an intellectual property lawsuit against
a Chinese company after the two sides reached an agreement on
software purchases.  
 Microsoft agreed to settle a lawsuit it filed against CITIC
Kington Securities at a court in the eastern city of Hangzhou,
the U.S. company said in an e-mailed statement today. CITIC
Kington will buy 3.23 million yuan ($477,000) of Microsoft
software as part of the settlement, it said.  
 The maker of the Windows operating system is stepping up
action against Chinese companies for unlicensed software use.
Microsoft is losing billions of dollars to software piracy in
the world’s third-biggest economy, Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer  said in May.  
 Microsoft said in April it won a decision from a court in
Shanghai against a Chinese insurance company for intellectual
property infringement. Last year, four people were sentenced to
prison terms for distributing pirated Microsoft products.
