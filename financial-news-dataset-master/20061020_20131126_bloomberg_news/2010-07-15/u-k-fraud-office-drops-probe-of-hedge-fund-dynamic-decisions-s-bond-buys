             Prosecutors at the U.K.’s Serious
Fraud Office dropped a probe into hedge fund Dynamic Decisions
Capital Management Ltd., saying they didn’t find enough evidence
to go ahead with a prosecution.  
 The fund was being investigated over allegations that
founder  Alberto Micalizzi  invested in worthless bonds. Micalizzi
said in November the allegations were unfounded.  
 “The eventual outcome of the investigation was never in
question for us,” the hedge fund said in an e-mailed statement
today. “Hence, although we are certainly satisfied with the
conclusion of the SFO’s investigation, the announcement brought
us little joy.”  
 The fund’s Cayman Islands liquidators at Grant Thornton LLP
said Nov. 12 that they were investigating the fund’s purchase of
corporate bonds in 2009. Allegations were made that the purchase
didn’t follow the fund’s investment strategy and that the
securities had no value, Grant Thornton said.  
 The SFO said in a statement on  its website  yesterday it was
dropping the case because the investigation hadn’t produced
enough evidence “to give rise to a realistic prospect of
conviction.”  
 Grant Thornton spokeswoman Suvra Datta said she couldn’t
immediately comment.  
 “Some of the damage done to our reputation may be
irreparable, and the shadow of the SFO investigation has
contributed to the difficulty in closing the sale of the bonds
held by the liquidating fund,” Dynamic Decisions said.
