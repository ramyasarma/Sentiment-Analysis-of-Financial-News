             U.K. stocks erased earlier losses,
as a rally in GlaxoSmithKline Plc shares and better-than-
estimated earnings from JPMorgan Case & Co. offset declines by
basic-resources companies.  
 The benchmark FTSE 100 Index gained 0.1 percent to 5,260.42
at 11:52 a.m. in London, after earlier falling as much as 0.7
percent.
