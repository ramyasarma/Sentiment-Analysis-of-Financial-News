             General  David Richards , the head of
the British Army, was appointed yesterday as chief of the
defence staff, the country’s top military post, the Financial
Times reported.  
 Richards will take over from Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup
this autumn, the newspaper said.  
 The appointment by Prime Minister  David Cameron  means
Richards will have enhanced influence over the government’s
strategic defense and security review, as a result of which the
defense ministry’s budget is likely to be cut by at least 10
percent, the FT said.  
 Richards wants reconciliation with the Taliban in
Afghanistan to be pursued more energetically, and believes the
notion that the insurgents might surrender is mistaken, the
newspaper said, citing an unidentified associate of the general.
