             W.P. Carey & Co. , owner of the New
York Times Co.’s headquarters, plans to spend about $3 billion
buying European properties and leasing them back to the sellers
as more businesses divest real estate to raise money.  
 The company, which specializes in sale-and-leaseback deals,
has about $1.5 billion of cash to invest in the region during
the next three to five years,  H. Cabot Lodge , head of Europe,
said in an interview at the company’s London offices. It plans
to borrow a similar amount over that period to help finance
acquisitions, he said.  
 European companies are increasingly turning to sale-
leaseback arrangements to raise cash as bank lending remains
restricted, according to broker  CB Richard Ellis Group Inc . By
selling their shops, offices or warehouses, companies can use
the proceeds to expand and stay in the buildings as tenants.  
 “Capital is still tight,” said Lodge, 54. “A lot of
chief executives who said they would never sell their real
estate are now being pushed into it.”  
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA , Spain’s second-biggest
bank, raised 1.15 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in September by
selling 948 of its branches.  HSBC Holdings Plc  sold its
headquarters in London’s Canary Wharf financial district for
1.09 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) in April 2007.  
 Potential Deals  
 W.P. Carey’s funds already own about $3 billion of
properties in Europe and about $7 billion in the U.S. There is
far more potential for sale-and-leasebacks in Europe than there
is in America, Lodge said. Two-thirds of European businesses own
their properties, compared with a third of U.S. companies,
according to W.P. Carey.  
 CB Richard Ellis is advising about three times as many
European landlords about raising money from their real estate as
it was a year ago, said John Wilson, the broker’s London-based
head of corporate strategies.  
 “They’re effectively short of working capital to
restructure themselves for the upturn,” Wilson said in a
telephone interview.  
 The value of European sale-and-leasebacks surged to 46
billion euros in 2007 from 6.9 billion euros in 2004, according
to CB Richard Ellis. Such deals have made up about 20 percent of
European real estate transactions since 2007, Wilson said.  
 W.P. Carey purchased two warehouses from Eroski, a Spanish
supermarket chain, for $52 million last month, according to its
 website . The company’s biggest European deal was in 2007, when
it bought a real estate unit and some debt from Hellweg, a
German home-improvement company, for 335 million euros.  
 In March 2009, W.P. Carey bought the space occupied by the
New York Times in its Manhattan headquarters for $225 million
and leased it back to the newspaper group for 15 years.
