             Russian stocks dropped the most in
two weeks as oil slid below $76 after economic reports in the
U.S. disappointed investors.  
 Oil producer  OAO Rosneft  lost 2.1 percent and  OAO Gazprom
Neft  retreated 1.9 percent.  Federal Grid Co ., Russia’s power
distribution monopoly, dropped 3.2 percent, helping to push the
 Micex Index  of 30 companies lower by 1.4 percent to 1,340.2 at
the close in Moscow. The gauge earlier gained as much 1.3
percent.  
 Crude, Russia’s biggest export earner, fell as much as 1.7
percent, to $75.33 a barrel in New York. Reports today showed
manufacturing in the New York and Philadelphia regions cooled in
July.  
 “These U.S. manufacturing numbers have scared investors
and it’s not good for emerging markets,”  Peter Westin , chief
strategist at Aton Capital in Moscow, said by phone. “We expect
to see people turning to blue chips for security.”  
 Stocks in Russia have fallen 12 percent since their April
15 peak on fears the global recovery is slowing.
