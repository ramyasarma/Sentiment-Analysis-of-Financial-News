             Anglo American Plc  should separate
its South African unit from the rest of the business,  Business Day 
said, citing a report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  
 The split will result in a rerating of Anglo’s
international assets, boosting the company’s combined value by
17 percent, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing the
report by analysts led by  Jason Fairclough .  
 South Africa’s mining industry moves from “crisis to
crisis” and BofA Merrill Lynch analysts struggled to find a
reason to be positive on the outlook for mines in the country,
Business Day cited the report as saying.
