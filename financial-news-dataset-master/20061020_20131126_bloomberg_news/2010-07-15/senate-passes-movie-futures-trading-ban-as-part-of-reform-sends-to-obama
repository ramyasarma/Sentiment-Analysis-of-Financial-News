             The U.S. Senate approved a ban on
movie-futures trading as part of its broader financial reform
bill, sending the measure to President  Barack Obama  to sign.  
 The measure blocking futures contracts by Cantor Fitzgerald
LP and Media Derivatives Inc. passed today by a 60-38 vote.  
 Passage is a victory for Hollywood’s largest studios, which
argued that speculation on box-office performance would
undermine a movie’s prospects for success and lead to insider
trading. Cantor and Media Derivatives proposed markets that
would enable investors to bet on ticket sales in the U.S. and
Canada weeks before a movie’s debut.  
 The trading ban is part of broader legislation proposed by
the Obama administration to tighten controls on financial
markets following the 2008 crisis. The measure was approved by
the House of Representatives last month.  
 The Motion Picture Association of America , representing the
six largest studios, lobbied against futures trading. Industry
groups including the Directors Guild of America and the National
Association of Theatre Owners also opposed the Cantor and Media
Derivatives plans.
