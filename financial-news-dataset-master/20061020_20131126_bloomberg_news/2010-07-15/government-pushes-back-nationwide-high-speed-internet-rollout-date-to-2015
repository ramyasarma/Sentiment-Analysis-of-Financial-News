             Culture Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  said
the U.K. would abandon a target set by the previous government
to secure nationwide access to high-speed Internet networks by
2012, setting a target for 2015 instead.  
 “I have looked at the provision the government had made to
achieve this by 2012,” Hunt told representatives of
telecommunications companies in London today. “I’m afraid that
I am not convinced that there is sufficient funding in place.”  
 “While we will keep working towards that date, we have set
ourselves a more realistic target of achieving universal 2Mbps
access within the lifetime of this parliament,” he said,
referring to the planned speed of 2 megabits per second.
