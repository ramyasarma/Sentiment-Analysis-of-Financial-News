             Gold rose as a drop in the dollar
boosted the appeal of the precious metal as an alternative
asset.  
 The dollar fell as much as 1 percent against a basket of
six major currencies and touched a nine-week low against the
euro. Gold reached a record $1,266.50 an ounce in New York on
June 21 and traded at an all-time high in euros.  
 “We remain bullish of gold, although we may soon begin to
focus upon gold in dollar terms rather than solely seeing gold
in terms of the euro, sterling or even the Swiss franc,” said
 Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  
 Gold futures for August delivery rose $2.60, or 0.2
percent, to $1,209.60 an ounce at 9:48 a.m. on the Comex in New
York, after earlier gaining as much as 0.9 percent.  
 The euro rose above $1.28 for the first time since May as
demand for Spain’s government bonds eased concerns that the
nation won’t be able to fund its deficit. Gold reached records
priced in sterling and Swiss francs last month amid Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  
 Gold traditionally has moved in tandem with the euro as an
alternative to the dollar.  
 “Gold seems to be reverting back to its relationship with
the dollar,” said  Dan Smith , an analyst at Standard Chartered
Plc in London. “The safe-haven part for demand is important and
will be the most important thing to watch in the next few
weeks.”  
 Low Interest Rates  
 The Federal Reserve has held the benchmark U.S. interest
rate at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 to stimulate
the economy. Policy makers cut their forecast for the U.S.
expansion, according to the minutes of their June 22-June 23
meeting released yesterday.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its six-month gold forecast
to $1,290 from $1,275 and its 12-month estimate to $1,355 from
$1,335. The new forecasts were made in a report dated today and
the prior estimates were from a note dated June 22. UBS AG today
cut its one-month forecast for the metal to $1,230 from $1,300.  
 Silver futures for September delivery rose 4.5 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $18.335 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery gained $9.40, or 0.6
percent, to $1,530 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Palladium futures for September delivery added $4.80, or 1
percent, to $470.60 an ounce on the Nymex.
