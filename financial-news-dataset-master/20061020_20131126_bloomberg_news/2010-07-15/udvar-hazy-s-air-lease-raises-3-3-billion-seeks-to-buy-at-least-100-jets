             Air Lease Corp.,  Steven Udvar-Hazy ’s
new jet-leasing company, said it secured $3.3 billion in
financing and has begun buying aircraft with plans to exceed 100
airliners by early next year.  
 Air Lease raised about $1.3 billion of equity capital and
received $2 billion of debt commitments,  John Plueger , the Los
Angeles-based lessor’s president and chief operating officer,
said in a statement today.  
 “The company is already in the process of acquiring a
portfolio of aircraft and has lease commitments from a large
group of diversified airlines,” Air Lease said.  
 Udvar-Hazy founded International Lease Finance Corp. in
1973, selling it to insurer  American International Group Inc.  in
1990. He built it into the world’s largest plane lessor and the
biggest customer for Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS before resigning
in February. ILFC had lost access to its normal sources of
funding because of its parent company’s woes amid a $182.3
billion government bailout during the recession.  
 Plueger, who had helped lead ILFC for more than two
decades, left in March to rejoin Udvar-Hazy and help found Air
Lease.  
 FBR Capital Markets managed Air Lease’s private placement
of equity, while Moelis & Co. acted as financial adviser.
