             U.S. stock-index futures advanced
after JPMorgan Chase & Co. posted second-quarter earnings that
beat analysts’ estimates.  
 JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, had second-quarter
profit of $1.09 a share, or 87 cents a share excluding all
items. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated profit of 71
cents on average.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September rose 0.4 percent to 1,095.3 at 11:33 a.m. in London.
