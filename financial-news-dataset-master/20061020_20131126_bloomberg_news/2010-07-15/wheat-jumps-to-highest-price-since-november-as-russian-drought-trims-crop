             Wheat jumped the most in 19 months
on speculation that a prolonged dry spell will widen crop damage
in Russia, the world’s fourth-largest exporter.  
 Russia’s grain harvest will drop by at least 20 percent
from last year, to 77 million metric tons, the country’s Grain
Producers’ Union said today. The  dollar  has declined 1.6 percent
this week against a basket of major currencies, boosting the
appeal of wheat from the U.S., the world’s largest exporter.
Wheat futures have surged 24 percent this month.  
 “It looks like we’re pricing in some Russian weather,”
said  Dan Kuechenmeister , the manager of the commodities
department at RBC Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis. “When you see
headlines that say ‘The worst drought in 130 years,’ that gets
people’s attention.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery advanced 37.25 cents,
or 6.7 percent, to $5.9625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The increase was the biggest since Nov. 24, 2008. The
price touched $5.985 earlier, the highest since Nov. 23, and
gained 11 percent in the past three sessions.  
 Russian production will plunge from 97 million tons in 2009
because of drought in 17 Russian regions, the producers union
said.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
