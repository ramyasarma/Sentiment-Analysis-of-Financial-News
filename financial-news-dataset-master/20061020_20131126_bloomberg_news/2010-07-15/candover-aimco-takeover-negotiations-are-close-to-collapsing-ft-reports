             Candover Investments Plc ’s
acquisition by Canadian pension fund Alberta Investment
Management Corp. appears to be on the verge of collapse, the
Financial Times reported, citing unidentified people familiar
with the situation. Candover is trying to continue negotiations,
the newspaper said.  
 In another matter, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and TPG Capital
may announce today the buyout of Ontex NV, which Candover bought
for more than 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) more than seven
years ago, the FT said.
