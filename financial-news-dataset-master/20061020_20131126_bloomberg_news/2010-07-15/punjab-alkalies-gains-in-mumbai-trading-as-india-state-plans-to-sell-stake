             Punjab Alkalies & Chemicals Ltd. 
gained the most in more than two and a half years in Mumbai
today after the northern Indian state of Punjab said it plans to
sell its stake in the chemical maker.  
 The shares surged by their daily trading limit of 20
percent to 39.05 rupees, the most since Nov. 14, 2007, as of 10
a.m. local time. The key Sensitive Index was little changed.  
 “The government’s announcement to sell shares could be a
trigger,” said  Alex K. Mathews , research head at Geojit BNP
Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi, in southern India.  
 The Punjab government is planning to sell its entire 44.26
percent stake in Punjab Alkalies, according to an advertisement
today in the Economic Times. The regional government holds the
stake through the directorate of disinvestment. IFCI Ltd. is the
adviser to the sale, the advertisement said.  
 The company posted a  loss  of 224 million rupees ($4.8
million) in the year ended March 31, compared with a profit of
71 million rupees the year earlier.
