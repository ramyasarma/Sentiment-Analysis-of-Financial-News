             Domestic business-class airfares in
Australia are the cheapest in a decade, the Australian Financial
Review reported, citing data from the Bureau of Infrastructure,
Transport and Regional Economics.  
 The fares fell for a seventh consecutive month in July and
are now down 5 percent on the same time last year, the newspaper
said. Prices may fall further as Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd.
competes with Qantas Airways Ltd. for the premium market, it
reported, without saying where it got the information.
