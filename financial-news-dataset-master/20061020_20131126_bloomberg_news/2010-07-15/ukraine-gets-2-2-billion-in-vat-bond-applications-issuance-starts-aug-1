             Ukraine’s government has received
17.6 billion hryvnia ($2.2 billion) in applications for bonds to
compensate exporters for outstanding value-added tax refunds,
Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said.  
 The bonds will be issued starting on Aug. 1, Azarov told
reporters in Kiev today. The government needs to compensate
exporters for the VAT debt on order to qualify for the
International Monetary Fund’s new $14.9 billion loan to the
former Soviet state. Azarov said today his administration “will
adhere to every comma in our agreement with the IMF.”  
 The government has said the bonds will be free to trade on
the secondary market. The bonds will mature in five years and
will pay a 5.5 percent coupon. The VAT bond auctions will cover
debt owed through May 1, according to Deputy Finance Minister
Tetyana Yefymenko.  
 The government raised 924.2 million hryvnia though selling
domestic bonds at yields between 9.42 percent to 12.5 percent on
July 13 to cover the state budget deficit, according to the
Finance Ministry.  
 The government spent last week on a road show to drum up
investor interest for its first Eurobond sale since 2007.
Ukraine plans to sell about $2 billion in 10-year debt on
international markets as early as this month. The new Eurobond
issue will be probably placed with a yield in the range of 8.125
percent to 8.375 percent, according to Renaissance Capital.  
 “The quick passage of the IMF-required measures is
supportive of domestic financial markets as well as the ongoing
sovereign Eurobond placement,” Kiev-based Dragon Capital said
in a note to clients yesterday. “A positive IMF-related news
flow will create a favorable backdrop for the government to
print the paper by the end of this week.”  
 The government has selected JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan
Stanley and VTB Capital to lead the issuance.  
 The yield on the 6.58 percent dollar bond due November 2016
rose 12 basis points to 7.91 percent, according to Bloomberg
prices.
