             Gambia sentenced eight former
security officials to death over their role in an attempt to
oust President  Yahya Jammeh , said Justice Minister Edward Gomez,
who is also the West African country’s attorney general.  
 “All were involved in plots to stage a coup to overthrow
the president and other seditious behavior,” Gomez said in an
interview from the capital, Banjul, after today’s sentencing by
Justice Emmanuel Amabi. Gomez said the defendants were
“senior”
security officials. He declined to give their names.  
 They were charged this year with planning to overthrow
Jammeh after buying arms and seeking out mercenaries in Guinea
Bissau to help them carry out the planned coup. The eight men
denied the charges. One of their defense lawyers, Pap Jabbie,
said there never was a coup attempt, the Freedom newspaper
reported today.  
 In a 2006 case, Jammeh ordered the arrest of 11 people
accused of trying to overthrow him. In June last year, he
ordered seven journalists jailed for two years for criticizing
him. The seven were pardoned after international criticism.  
 Jammeh came to power in a bloodless coup in 1994 and has
won every election since then.
