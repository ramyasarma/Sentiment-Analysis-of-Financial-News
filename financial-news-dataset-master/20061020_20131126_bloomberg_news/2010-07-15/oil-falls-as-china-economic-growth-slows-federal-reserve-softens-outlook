             Crude oil rose as the dollar
weakened against the euro, after the Federal Reserve said the
U.S. economic outlook has “softened.”  
 Oil rebounded as the euro climbed above $1.28. Futures had
fallen 0.7 percent after reports showing China’s economic growth
eased and that U.S. gasoline inventories are 4.3 percent above
their five-year average. The Federal Reserve said risks to the
U.S. outlook “have shifted to the downside” in the minutes of
its June meeting released yesterday.  
 “Oil has been tracking the euro, after it strengthened to
$1.28 this morning,” up from its early June lows, said Roland
Stenzel, a crude and carbon trader at E&T Energie
Handelsgesellschaft mbH in Vienna. The European currency has
recovered from a four-year low of $1.1877 reached on June 7.  
 Crude for August delivery rose as much as 62 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $77.66 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and was at $77.53 at 11:42 a.m. London
time. Brent crude for August settlement, which expires today on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, was up 36 cents at
$77.13 a barrel after falling as low as $76.19. The more
actively traded September future was up 45 cents at $77.11.  
 The dollar traded at $1.2823 against the euro after
slipping to $1.2835. A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for
investors in other currencies.  
 U.S. gasoline inventories are 4.3 percent above their five-
year average, even in the midst of the country’s driving season,
an Energy Department report showed yesterday. Economic growth in
China, the second-largest energy user, slowed to 10.3 percent in
the quarter ended June, from 11.9 percent in the first three
months of the year, the Beijing-based statistics bureau said.  
 Backwardated Brent  
 Brent futures in London for the earliest delivery were more
expensive than later contracts for a second day, after settling
at a premium yesterday for the first time in almost a year,
following North Sea field maintenance.  
 Yesterday was the first time the contract closest to
expiration has settled above the subsequent month since Aug. 14.
Before that date, front-month Brent contracts had not
consistently traded at a premium since May 2008.  
 A market in which near-term contracts are more expensive
than those further out in time is described as being in
backwardation. The reverse condition is called contango.  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said
global oil demand will grow in 2011 at about the same rate as
this year, led by developing economies such as China and India.  
 Worldwide crude oil consumption will increase by 1.05
million barrels a day, or 1.2 percent, next year to average
86.41 million barrels a day, the organization’s Vienna-based
secretariat said today in its first assessment for 2011.  
 This year OPEC predicts demand will grow 950,000 barrels a
day, or 1.1 percent driven by countries outside the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.
