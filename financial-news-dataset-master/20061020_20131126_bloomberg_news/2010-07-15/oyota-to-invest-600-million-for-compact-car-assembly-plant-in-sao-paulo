             Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s
largest automaker, said it will invest $600 million to build a
new car factory in Sorocaba, in the Brazilian state of Sao
Paulo.  
 Construction of the new factory, which will have annual
capacity to produce 70,000 units, will begin in September,
Toyota said. The plant will start production of a compact model
in the second half of 2012, the company said today in an e-
mailed statement.
