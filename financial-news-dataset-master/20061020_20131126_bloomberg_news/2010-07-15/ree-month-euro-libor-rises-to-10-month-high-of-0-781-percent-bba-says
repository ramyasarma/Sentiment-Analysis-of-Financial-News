             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros in London climbed to the highest
level in 10 months, data from the British Bankers’ Association
showed.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
was at 0.781 percent, the most since Sept. 2, 2009, the BBA said
today. The rate was 0.774 percent yesterday. The euro Libor-OIS
spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to lend, was little changed
at 23 basis points as of 11:45 a.m. in London.  
 Three-month dollar Libor was little changed at 0.525
percent, the BBA said.  
 Three-month Euribor rose to 0.846 percent, the most since
Aug. 21, 2009, from 0.840 percent yesterday, according to data
from the European Banking Federation.
