             Steve Miller  became  American
International Group Inc.’s  sixth chairman since 2005 when he was
selected yesterday to replace  Harvey Golub , who stepped down
after a dispute with Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche .  
 The following is a timeline showing milestones in the
tenures of New York-based AIG’s chairmen since 2005.  
 March 28, 2005: AIG says  Frank Zarb  will become chairman,
replacing  Maurice “Hank” Greenberg  amid accounting probes by
New York Attorney General  Eliot Spitzer .  
 Feb. 9, 2006: AIG agrees under  Martin Sullivan , who had replaced
Greenberg as CEO, to pay $1.64 billion to resolve state and
federal allegations that it misled investors and regulators.  
 Sept. 20, 2006: AIG names former Citigroup Inc. president  Robert Willumstad  as chairman.  
 May 14, 2008: Willumstad says directors support management,
adding, “We think Martin’s the right guy.”  
 June 15, 2008: Willumstad replaces Sullivan as CEO. The next
day, Willumstad says “there will be no sacred cows” as he
initiates a companywide review of AIG’s operations.  
 Sept. 16, 2008: The U.S. agrees to loan AIG as much as $85
billion in exchange for a stake of almost 80 percent after
credit downgrades force the insurer to post collateral to banks
that purchased credit-default swaps from the company. The
government ousts Willumstad.  
 Sept. 18, 2008:  Edward Liddy , who ran Allstate Corp. from 1999
to 2006, is approved by AIG’s board as the new chairman and CEO,
AIG says in a statement. Liddy tells employees he intends to
repay the two-year Federal Reserve loan early.  
 March 2, 2009: Liddy reports a record $61.7 billion fourth-
quarter loss and secures an additional Treasury injection of as
much as $29.8 billion, raising the total to $182.3 billion.  
 May 21, 2009: Liddy says there are “very strong internal
candidates” to succeed him after he steps down. “Life provides
you inflection points,” says Liddy. “The game plan that we
have will take three-plus years to unfold. At 63, I don’t want
to be doing this when I’m 67.”  
 Aug. 3, 2009: AIG says Benmosche, the former chairman and CEO of
MetLife Inc., will take over as CEO.  
 Aug. 6, 2009: AIG names Golub, the former American Express Co.
CEO, as chairman.  
 Aug. 11, 2009: Golub will work with lawmakers, Benmosche tells
employees, allowing him to focus on operations and deciding
which units should be kept.  
 Golub “is going to run interference for me in Washington,”
Benmosche says.  
 Nov. 11, 2009: Benmosche tells employees he is “totally
committed” to leading the insurer after the Wall Street Journal
reported that he told the board he may step down because of
government limits on what the company can pay his managers.  
 March 1, 2010: AIG announces a deal to sell AIA Group Ltd. to
Prudential Plc for about $35.5 billion after Benmosche decides
against holding an IPO for the unit.  
 April 1, 2010: Benmosche expects to remain for another year or
two, he tells Bloomberg.  
 June 1, 2010: Prudential deal collapses after the U.K.-based
insurer asked for a lower price. Benmosche wanted to accept the
reduced offer, and the board refused, opting to proceed with a
public offering for the unit, according to people with knowledge
of the situation.  
 June 25, 2010: Benmosche, 66, threatens to resign unless Golub
leaves the firm, according to two people familiar with the
situation.  
 July 14, 2010: Golub, 71, steps down, writing in his resignation
letter that Benmosche believes their relationship is
“ineffective and unsustainable.” Miller, 68, the former CEO of
 Delphi Corp.  who joined AIG’s board last year, is named
chairman.
