             U.S. stocks pared losses after the
Securities and Exchange Commission announced it will make a
“significant announcement” after markets close.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent after
sliding as much as 1.2 percent earlier. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., which was sued by the SEC in April for fraud related to
mortgage securities, jumped 3.7 percent.
