             Skilled Healthcare Group Inc. , which
was ordered by a California jury to pay $671 million for
improperly staffing nursing homes, agreed to try to settle the
case in mediation.  
 Skilled Healthcare and the plaintiffs in the suit agreed to
end all litigation during the mediation, the Foothill Ranch,
California-based company said in a statement today.  
 The plaintiffs  accused  Skilled Healthcare of improperly
staffing 22 facilities in the state. A Humboldt County jury on
July 6 found the company liable for $613 million in statutory
damages, the maximum allowed by state law, and $58 million for
restitution.  
 The lawsuit was filed in 2006 on behalf of current and
former residents of 22 Skilled Healthcare operations in
California.  
 The verdict is the largest jury award in the U.S. this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Skilled Healthcare said
the award exceeds the policy limits of its insurance. The
company had a  net loss  of $133 million last year on revenue of
$759.8 million.  
 Skilled Healthcare also agreed not to file for bankruptcy
protection during the mediation period, which is scheduled to
end Aug. 9. The proposal must be approved by a judge. A hearing
is scheduled today, Skilled Healthcare said.  
 The case is Lavender v. Skilled Healthcare Group, DR060264,
Superior Court, Humboldt County, California (Eureka).
