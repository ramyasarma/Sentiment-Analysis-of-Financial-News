             Turkey posted a budget deficit of
5.4 billion liras ($3.5 billion) in June, more than double the
year-earlier figure.  
 The gap widened from 2.5 billion liras in June 2009
according to figures on the website of the Finance Ministry in
Ankara. The deficit before interest payments on debt widened to
2.1 billion liras from 1.4 billion.  
 The budget’s overall performance in the first half of the
year, helped by economic growth and tighter tax collection,
remains ahead of year-end targets even after the June deficit,
Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said in Ankara today. Turkey’s
economy has  expanded  for the last four quarters as it recovers
from last year’s recession.  
 The overall budget deficit in the first six months of the
year narrowed to 15.4 billion liras from 23.2 billion liras in
the same period of 2009. The government’s year-end goal is a
deficit of 50.2 billion liras, or about 5 percent of gross
domestic product.  
 Revenue increased 19 percent in the first six months from a
year earlier, while spending rose 9.3 percent and non-interest
spending by 11.6 percent, according to Finance Ministry data.  
 The so-called primary surplus, which excludes interest
payments, was 12.1 billion liras in the first half of the year,
almost double the year-end target of 6.6 billion liras.
