             ZF Steering Gear (India) Ltd., an
automobile-parts maker, rose to a record in Mumbai trading after
saying first-quarter profit more than doubled.  
 The shares climbed as much as 9.3 percent to 358.7 rupees,
its highest level since Bloomberg began tracking the stock in
January 1991. Net income in the three months ended June rose to
118 million rupees from 42.9 million rupees a year earlier, it
said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange yesterday.
