             Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.,
Japan’s largest phone company, is in talks to buy  Dimension Data
Plc  of South Africa in a possible 300 billion yen ($3.4 billion)
transaction, the Nikkei newspaper reported, citing unidentified
company officials.  
 Tokyo-based NTT will start a tender offering as early as
next month to make the largest computer-services company in
Africa a wholly owned unit, the report said. The phone company
aims to add to the client base for its data services in Europe
and the U.S., it said.  
 Hideomi Tenma, a spokesman for NTT, said he couldn’t
immediately comment on the Nikkei report. Dimension Data Chief
Executive Officer  Brett Dawson  didn’t immediately return a
message left on his mobile phone seeking comment. Hilary King,
a spokeswoman for the African company, wasn’t immediately able
to comment.  
 NTT is seeking growth overseas. Its subsidiary NTT
Communications Corp. last year bought Ismaning, Germany-based
Integralis AG.  
 NTT fell 1.6 percent to close at 3,705 yen in Tokyo trading.
