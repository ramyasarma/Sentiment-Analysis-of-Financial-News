             Coffee prices climbed to a two-week
high in New York as a falling dollar increased the appeal of
some commodities. Cocoa futures were little changed.  
 The  greenback  fell as much as 1 percent against a basket of
six major currencies, reaching the lowest level since May 4. The
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials climbed as much
as 0.6 percent. Before today, arabica coffee jumped 21 percent
this year, while robusta beans traded in London advanced 34
percent.  
 “It’s a technical move more than anything else,” said
 Hector Galvan , a senior trading adviser at RJO Futures in
Chicago. “We were just trading sideways and finally broke out
to the upside. The dollar is down, which is positive.”  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery rose 3.7 cents, or
2.2 percent, to $1.686 a pound at 9:28 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Earlier, prices climbed 2.8 percent to $1.6945, the
highest level for a most-active contract since June 28. Robusta
futures for September delivery gained $40, or 2.3 percent, to
$1,771 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in London.  
 “For right now, a lot of the technicians are the ones that
are driving the market back and forth,” Galvan said. “If we
break $1.70, it looks to go higher just off the technicals.”  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery were little changed at
$3,152 a ton in New York. On London’s Liffe, the cocoa contract
for September delivery fell 15 pounds, or 0.6 percent, to 2,421
pounds ($3,721) a ton.
