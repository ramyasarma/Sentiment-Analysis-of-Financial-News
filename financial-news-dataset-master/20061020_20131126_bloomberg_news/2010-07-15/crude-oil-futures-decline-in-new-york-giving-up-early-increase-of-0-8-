             Crude oil tumbled after government
reports bolstered concern that the U.S. economic recovery will
slow, reducing fuel consumption.  
 Oil dipped 0.6 percent after the Federal Reserve said that
U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in June, the biggest
decline in a year. Other reports showed factories pulled back in
the New York and Philadelphia regions in July. The major stock
indexes dropped at least 1.2 percent before rebounding after oil
settled to close little changed.  
 “There’s nothing good in today’s economic reports that you
can point to,” said  Michael Fitzpatrick , vice president of
energy at MF Global in New York. “Oil is overpriced given where
the economy is.”  
 Crude for August delivery dropped 42 cents to settle at
$76.62 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
contract dropped as low as $75.33 during the session. The price
is up 25 percent from a year ago.  
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 7.41 points to
10,359.31 at 4:01 p.m. in New York, the first drop in eight
days. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1 percent to
1,096.48 after trading below the previous close most of the day.  
 Oil in New York has traded in a range of $8.29 for the past
month, from $71.09 to $79.38 a barrel. The August contract’s
discount to the December contract is $1.83, down from $3.21 on
June 18.  
 “Until we see solid economic growth, prices will stay in
this range,” said  Chip Hodge , who oversees a $9 billion
natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing director at
MFC Global Investment Management in Boston. “The forward curve
has come down a lot, which is a sign that people are less
optimistic about the economy and demand growth.”  
 New York Index  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that showed
its general economic index fell to 5.1 in July from 19.6 the
prior month. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general
economic index declined to 5.1 this month, the lowest level
since August 2009, from 8 in June.  
 Economists monitor the New York and Philadelphia Fed
factory reports for clues about the Institute for Supply
Management figures on U.S. manufacturing during the month. The
July ISM data will be released Aug. 2.  
 China’s economic growth rate eased to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter. The gain in gross domestic product was less than
an 11.9 percent increase in January-March from a year earlier.
Industrial output rose 13.7 percent, less than all but one of 27
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “Their economy is clearly decelerating, which has to worry
investors,” said  Bill O’Grady , chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis.  
 The U.S. and China, the world’s biggest energy consuming
countries, accounted for 32 percent of global oil demand in
2009, according to BP Plc, which publishes its BP Statistical
Review of World Energy each June.  
 OPEC Shipments  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, supplier
of about 40 percent of the world’s oil, will ship 23.6 million
barrels a day in the four weeks to July 31, compared with 23.58
million in the month ended July 3, according to tanker tracker
Oil Movements. The data exclude Ecuador and Angola.  
 OPEC’s compliance with production targets slipped in June
on higher production from Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. The
11 members bound by quotas increased output by 61,700 barrels a
day to 26.86 million, implying compliance of 52 percent,
according to the group’s Monthly Oil Market Report today. OPEC
completed 54 percent of its promised cuts in May, the data show.  
 An Energy Department report yesterday showed that
stockpiles of gasoline and distillate fuel, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, increased last week as crude
oil supplies dropped. Both crude and fuel stockpiles were above
the five-year average for the period.  
 ‘A Lot of Crude’  
 “We still have a lot of crude on hand,” said  Kyle Cooper ,
a managing director at energy consultant IAF Advisors in
Houston. “What we need are products such as gasoline, and those
supplies increased.”  
 Gasoline for August delivery slipped 0.58 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $2.0607 a gallon in New York. Heating oil
for August delivery declined 1.78 cents, or 0.9 percent, to end
the session at $2.0183 a gallon.  
 Brent crude for August settlement fell 58 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $76.19 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The August contract expired
today. The more actively traded September contract dropped 57
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $76.09.  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 588,338 contracts as of 3:09
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 683,617
contracts yesterday, 8.2 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.28 million contracts.
