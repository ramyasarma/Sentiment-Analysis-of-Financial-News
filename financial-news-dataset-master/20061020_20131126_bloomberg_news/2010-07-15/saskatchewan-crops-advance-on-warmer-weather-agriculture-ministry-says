             Warmer weather in Saskatchewan,
Canada’s biggest grain-producing province, enabled behind-normal
crops to catch up, the provincial ministry of agriculture said
 today in a report.   
 Winter wheat was 82 percent in good to excellent condition,
while 79 percent of spring wheat, 82 percent of durum wheat and
73 percent of canola were rated good or fair, the ministry said.
Flooding has harmed plants and reduced seedings, and leaf and
root diseases also are causing damage, the report said.
