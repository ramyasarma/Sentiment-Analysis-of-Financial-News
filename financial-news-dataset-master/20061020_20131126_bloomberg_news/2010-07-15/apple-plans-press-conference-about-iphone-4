             Apple Inc. , facing complaints over
the antenna reception of its new iPhone 4, will hold a press
conference on July 16 to discuss the device.  
 The meeting will be held at the company’s headquarters in
Cupertino, California, said  Steve Dowling , an Apple spokesman.
He declined to elaborate on what will be discussed.  
 Since Apple released the iPhone 4 on June 24, users have
complained about losing reception when they cover the lower-left
corner of the device. Consumer Reports said this week it
wouldn’t recommend the phone because of the problem, and some
analysts have said Apple needs to address the concerns or risk
harming sales.  
 “Apple’s image -- and potentially iPhone sales -- could be
compromised if Apples does not explicitly -- and constructively
-- address the issue of what it believes is wrong with the
phone,”  Toni Sacconaghi , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co. in New York, wrote in a note to investors earlier this week.  
 Apple can either issue free cases to owners of the iPhone 4
to cover the antenna trouble spot or conduct a product recall,
he said. While the recall isn’t likely, such a move could cost
Apple $1.5 billion, Sacconaghi said.  
 The iPhone, first introduced in 2007, is Apple’s top-
selling product, accounting for about 40 percent of revenue. The
company sold 1.7 million in the first three days after the
release of the fourth-generation model. Apple reports earnings
on July 20.  
 The latest model has a new design that encases the antenna
in a metal band surrounding the phone, instead of making it a
separate piece. In response to the complaints, Apple has advised
users to either not touch the phone in the lower-left corner or
use a case.  
 Apple  climbed 93 cents to $252.73 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading today. The  shares  have risen 20 percent this year.
