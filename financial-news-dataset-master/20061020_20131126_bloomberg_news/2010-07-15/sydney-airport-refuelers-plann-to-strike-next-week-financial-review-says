             Aircraft refuelers at Sydney airport
plan to strike for 24 hours on July 21 over a pay dispute, the
Australian Financial Review reported, citing the Transport
Workers Union.  
 Refueling company Airport Fuel Services wants to introduce
a two-tiered pay structure for existing employees and for new
and casual staff, the newspaper said. Airport Fuel Services is
owned by Qantas Airways Ltd., Caltex Australia Ltd., BP Plc and
Mobil, it said.
