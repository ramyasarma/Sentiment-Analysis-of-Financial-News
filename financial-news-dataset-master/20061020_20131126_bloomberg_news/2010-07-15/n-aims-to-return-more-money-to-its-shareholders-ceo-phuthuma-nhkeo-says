             MTN Group Ltd. plans to return more
money to shareholders as it balances investor needs with its own
growth aspirations, Chief Executive Officer Phuthuma Nhleko
said.  
 “One of the things we will do is to increase dividend
payout ratio,” he said at the company’s annual general meeting
today. “Future growth will be organic and likely to be smaller
bolt on acquisitions.”
