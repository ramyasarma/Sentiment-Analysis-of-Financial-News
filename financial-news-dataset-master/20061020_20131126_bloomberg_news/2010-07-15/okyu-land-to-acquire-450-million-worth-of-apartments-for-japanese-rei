             Tokyu Land Corp. , Japan’s fourth-
largest developer, plans to acquire rental apartments in Tokyo
worth as much as 40 billion yen ($450 million) this fiscal year
for its planned real estate investment trust.  
 TLC Realty Management Inc., an asset-management arm of
Tokyu Land, plans to list the residential REIT within two to
three years,  Hiroyuki Tohmata , chief executive officer of the
unit, said in an interview in Tokyo. TLC will buy half of the
properties from Tokyu Land and the remainder from the market by
March 2011, he said.  
 Tokyo-based Tokyu Land is planning to list a REIT, which
may be the  first  in Japan since October 2007, after Japanese
land prices in 2009 tumbled the most in 13 years and the Tokyo
Stock Exchange  REIT  Index suffered three straight years of
declines as global financial crisis unfolded.  
 “We believe now is a good time to buy properties as we
prepare for the listing,” Tohmata said. “When the market
actually recovers, prices will become expensive.”  
 TLC Realty plans to acquire up to about 100 billion yen
worth of real estate for the fund before listing, Tohmata said.
The fund will target properties that will yield 5 to 6 percent,
he said.  
 Japan’s nationwide  average  property prices dropped 8
percent to 126,000 yen a square meter (11 square feet) as of Jan.
1, 2010, from a year ago, the second annual decline in a row,
according to a  National Tax Agency  report.  
 Japan’s 36 listed real estate investment trusts raised
195.5 billion yen in the first six months of this year, the
highest since 2008, according to Mizuho Securities Co.  
 Tokyu Land’s new REIT signals a recovery in the nation’s
property market, said  Yoji Otani , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG
in Tokyo. The last REIT that listed in Japan was  Industrial &
Infrastructure Fund Investment Corp.  on Oct. 18, 2007, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “Historically, Japan’s residential market has recovered
first and then the office market,” said Otani. “We are right
on that trend.”
