             Wheat futures jumped for a third day
in Paris and Chicago on concerns that dry weather will curb
output in Russia and northwestern Europe and speculation that
rain has damaged crops in Canada, Ukraine and central Europe.  
 Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose as much as 4.5 percent to 174 euros ($222.46) a
metric ton, the highest level since the contract started trading
in March 2009, and was at 172.25 euros recently. September-
delivery wheat rose as much as 3.1 percent on the Chicago Board
of Trade.  
 Germany’s 2010 wheat output will shrink 5.5 percent because
of drought, farm group Deutscher Raiffeisenverband e.V. forecast
yesterday. Ukraine’s grain crop will fall to between 44 million
and 45 million tons, from 46 million tons in 2009, due to excess
rain, the Ukrainian Agrarian Confederation said.  
 There has been “major tension on the European and U.S.
markets as the string of production damages in Europe and the
Black Sea region increases,” Paris-based farm adviser Agritel
said in a comment on its website today.  
 Chicago-traded wheat climbed as high as $5.7625 a bushel,
and was at $5.69 a bushel at 11:58 a.m. in Paris.  
 Russia and Kazakhstan may continue to have hot, dry weather
in the seven days through July 20, according to Telvent DTN Inc.
“Drier, hotter weather may also expand westward to include the
east and central Ukraine as well,” the forecaster said. Central
Europe may have “additional periods of hot weather,” it said.  
 Russia’s wheat crop harvested from next month may be 51
million metric tons, down from 61.7 million tons, because of
drought, Rabobank analyst  Luke Chandler  said yesterday. Dry
weather will persist in parts of the country through July 17,
according to a Federal Hydrometeorological Service forecast.  
 Russian Drought  
 The Russian Agriculture Ministry said yesterday that 17
regions have declared emergencies because of a drought, with
about 9.5 million hectares (23.5 million acres) affected.  
 Wheat output in Germany is likely to shrink to 23.8 million
tons as dry weather, particularly in former East Germany, pares
the nation’s total grain harvests, Deutscher Raiffeisenverband
said yesterday. Germany is the second-largest wheat grower in
the European Union after France, data from the bloc show.  
 Hungary’s wheat harvest will fall to 3.5 million to 4
million tons from 4.4 million tons a year earlier, state news
agency MTI reported yesterday, citing Gyorgy Czervan, the state
secretary in charge of agriculture.  
 Soybeans for November delivery added 0.9 percent on the
Chicago Board of Trade to $9.7075 a bushel at 12:04 p.m. Paris
time. Corn for December delivery climbed 0.6 percent to $3.9875
a bushel in Chicago.  
 November-delivery corn traded in Paris rose 3.2 percent to
169.50 euros a ton, and rapeseed for delivery the same month
added 2.6 percent to 368.75 euros a ton.
