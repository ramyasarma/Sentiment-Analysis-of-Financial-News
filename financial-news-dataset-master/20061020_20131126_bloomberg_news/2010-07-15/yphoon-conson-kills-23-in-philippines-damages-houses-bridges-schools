             Typhoon Conson killed 23 people,
left 59 missing and injured 14 others in the Philippines after
crossing the main island of Luzon from July 13.  
 The typhoon damaged 3,274 houses, bridges and schools in
seven provinces around the capital, Manila, according to the
latest situation report posted on the website of the National
 Disaster Coordinating Council . Power has been restored in some
areas hit by the typhoon and damages to infrastructure,
fisheries, agriculture and schools amount to 22.3 million pesos
($482,000), it said.  
 Conson, now a tropical storm, was located about 550
kilometers (342 miles) west northwest of Manila at 2 a.m.
Philippines time today, the  U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning
Center  said. Sustained winds were 93 kilometers per hour near
the center with the storm moving northwest at 22 kph, it said.  
 The storm’s winds are forecast to decrease in strength to
74 kph tomorrow as it approaches China’s Hainan island,
southwest of Hong Kong, the center said.  
 Conson is the name of a picturesque mountain region in
Vietnam, according to the website of the Hong Kong Observatory,
which lists  names  assigned to cyclones in the Pacific.  
 Last year, three typhoons left about 1,000 people dead and
40,000 homes destroyed, mostly in Luzon, the largest Philippine
island and where capital Manila is located.
