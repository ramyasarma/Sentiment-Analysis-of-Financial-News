             Alexandria Portland Cement Co. , a
unit of Greece’s Titan Cement Co., said today that it has
received regulatory approval for a 2.45 billion-Egyptian pound
($430 million) capital increase.  
 The company, based in Alexandria, Egypt, said in a
regulatory filing that it will offer 245 million shares with a
nominal value of 10 pounds each to existing shareholders.  
 Alexandria Portland shares gained 0.7 percent to 32.76
pounds at 11:53 a.m. in Cairo.  
 Egypt wants to increase cement output by 54 percent to 77
million tons by 2015, Amr Assal, the head of the country’s
Industrial Development Authority, said in December. Cement
production may increase to 60 million tons in 2011 from 50
million tons in 2009, he said.
