             The euro may be poised to advance to
the strongest level against the dollar in more than two months
as it approaches a critical level after breaking through another
one, according to online currency-trading firm Gain Capital.  
 The 16-nation currency broke through $1.2772, which
represents the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement, and is almost
at $1.2923, the euro’s 100-day moving average, said  Brian Dolan ,
chief strategist at FOREX.com, in Bedminster, New Jersey, a Gain
unit.  
 “At this point we have to reckon that the euro is going to
see $1.30, $1.31,” Dolan said in a telephone interview. “The
market is continuing to price in a non-negative outcome from the
stress test” of European banks due next week.  
 The euro gained 1.2 percent to $1.2901 at 2:56 p.m. in New
York, from $1.2743 yesterday, after touching $1.2918, the
highest level since May 10. An exchange rate of $1.31 would be
the highest since May 4.  
 The currency has climbed 5.3 percent versus the greenback
this month as sovereign bond sales in the region attracted
investor demand and speculation eased that fiscal problems are
worsening. It fell for each of the past seven months. The euro
has lost 10 percent this year on concern the sovereign-debt
crisis that started in Greece may hamper the economic recovery.  
 European regulators are examining the strength of 91 banks
to determine whether they can survive potential losses on
sovereign-debt holdings. Stress-test results will be released
July 23.  
 Spanish Bond Sale  
 Spain sold 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) of 15-year bonds,
attracting bids worth 2.57 times the securities offered,
compared with 1.79 the last time they were sold in April.  
 “Spain, with its 15 year auction today, suggested that the
worst of that sovereign credit crisis has passed,” Dolan said.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
new high or low. It is based on a formula developed by a 13th
century mathematician, Leonardo da Pisa, known as Fibonacci, who
discovered the sequence while studying the reproduction rate of
rabbits.
