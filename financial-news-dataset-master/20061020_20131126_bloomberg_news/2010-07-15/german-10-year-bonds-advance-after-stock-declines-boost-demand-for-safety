             German two-year government notes
fell, erasing an earlier advance, after Spain attracted
increased demand at a sale of 15-year bonds, fueling optimism
that Europe’s sovereign debt crisis is easing.  
 Spain’s two- and 10-year securities rebounded after the
country sold 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) of securities
maturing in 2025, meeting the maximum set for the offering.
Bunds had risen earlier on demand for the safest assets after a
report showing a cooling Chinese  economy  helped send stocks
lower. European equities and the euro recovered after Spain’s
debt auction.  
 “It appears that the market has calmed a bit with respect
to the sovereign-debt crisis,” and the Spanish auction is
“definitely” weighing on bunds, said  Niels From , chief analyst
at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “We’re not out of the woods,
but at least the tensions in the market have eased.”  
 The yield on the German two-year note increased two basis
points to 0.8 percent as of 11 a.m. in London, after being as
low as 0.75 percent earlier. The 0.5 percent security maturing
June 2012 lost 0.45, or 4.5 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
99.44. The yield on the 10-year bund yield was unchanged at 2.66
percent, after earlier falling to 2.63 percent.  
 The Spanish bonds were sold at an average yield of 5.116
percent, compared with 4.434 percent at an auction on April 22,
the Bank of Spain said. Demand was 2.57 times the amount sold,
compared with the bid-to-cover ratio of 1.79 at a similar sale
in April.  
 Spain’s 10-year bond yield decreased eight basis points to
4.67 percent, while that on the two-year security fell nine
basis points to 2.64 percent. The extra yield, or spread,
investors demand to hold the nation’s 10-year debt instead of
similar German bunds, Europe’s benchmark government securities,
narrowed to 199 basis points, the least since July 2.  
 German debt has returned 6.5 percent so far this year,
compared with 5.7 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 5.9 percent
for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts’ Societies.
Spanish bonds lost 2 percent, the indexes show.
