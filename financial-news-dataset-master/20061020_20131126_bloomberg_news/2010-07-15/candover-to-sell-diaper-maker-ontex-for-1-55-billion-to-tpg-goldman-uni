             Candover Investments Plc, a London-
based private equity firm, has agreed to sell Belgian diaper-
maker  Ontex NV  for 1.2 billion euros ($1.55 billion) to TPG Inc.
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s buyout arm.  
 The sale “will help improve the company’s liquidity at a
time of high volatility in markets and weakness of the euro,”
 Malcolm Fallen , chief executive officer of Candover Investments,
said in a statement today.  
 Candover Partners Ltd. is negotiating to sell itself to
Alberta Investment Management Corp., the Canadian pension fund
manager. Candover shut its 3 billion-euro leveraged buyout fund
in January amid a cash shortage, becoming the British private
equity industry’s biggest casualty of the credit crisis.  
 Candover’s acquisition by Alberta may be on the verge of
collapse, the Financial Times reported earlier today, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.  
 Candover  dropped  7.8 percent to 671 pence in London, giving
the company a market value of 146 million pounds ($224 million).  
 Ontex sales totaled 1.1 billion euros last year, the
company said in a separate statement today.
