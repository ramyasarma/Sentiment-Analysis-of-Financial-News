             Mothercare Plc , the baby products
retailer with 1,167 stores, fell the most in two weeks in London
trading after saying first-quarter sales at U.K. outlets open
more than a year dropped 4.1 percent.  
 Mothercare  retreated as much as 6.9 percent. Total U.K.
sales declined 2.6 percent for the 15 weeks to July 10, the
Watford, England-based company said in a statement today. Group
sales climbed 0.4 percent.  
 The first quarter was “always going to be tough” after
almost five years of like-for-like  sales growth , Chief Executive
Officer  Ben Gordon  said in a phone interview. Comparable sales
in the U.K. increased 5.1 percent in the same period last year.  
 “We had very strong sales last year, which was a bit of a
headwind,” Gordon said. “It continues to be a fairly tough
environment in the U.K.”  
 International retail sales, which increased 20 percent, are
“the main growth engine for the company”, the executive said.
About 50 percent of Mothercare’s sales are from its 777 overseas
stores, he said.  
 “The way I position it is that there are 750,000 live
births in the U.K. and 130 million live births outside the
U.K.,” Gordon said.  
 Mothercare plans to revive its U.K. sales by moving stores
from city and town centers to retail parks out of town, Gordon
said. It also plans to make greater use of its online business,
which accounts for 20 percent of its U.K. sales, the executive
said.  
 In February, Mothercare announced a partnership with
Alliance Boots Ltd.’s U.K. unit to supply children’s clothing
through Boots stores.  
 Mothercare  declined as much as 38 pence to 514 pence and
traded at 523 pence as of 8:42 a.m., giving the company a market
value of 462.8 million pounds ($707 million). The stock has
retreated 23 percent this year, compared with an 8.9 fall in the
 FTSE 350 General Retail Index .
