             Bank of America Corp.  has a novel
way to lure more customers: Free checking accounts for folks who
never again enter the bank.  
 The bank, the  largest  in the U.S. by assets, is introducing
an account on Aug. 6 that won’t include a monthly fee or minimum
balance requirement unless the customer wants to use a teller or
receive a monthly statement through the mail, said David Owen, a
senior vice president for checking and debit at the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based company. Visiting a branch to make a
deposit will trigger an $8.95 fee per month, he said.  
 Bank of America has tested the program in Georgia for eight
months with a third of new customers selecting the account, Owen
said in an interview yesterday. “It has had a much broader
appeal than we initially thought,” he said.  
 Bank of America is looking for more ways to make money from
consumer banking amid a U.S. regulatory overhaul, which ratings
company DBRS Inc. estimated may cut $1.9 billion from the
lender’s annual debit-card and credit-card revenue. The Senate
may vote as soon as this week on a bill that also establishes a
consumer financial protection agency.  
 Bank of America views the new account as different from the
mid-1990s programs by First Chicago Corp. and other banks to
levy $3 fees on people who dealt with tellers instead of
automated teller machines. The banks later dropped the charges
after criticism from customers.  
 “This account is up to the customer and they can choose
how they want to bank with us,” Owen said. “This is nothing
like those early programs.”  
 The bank has about 18,000 ATMs, including about 13,800 that
print images of deposited checks. Account holders who need to
deposit coins or have service-related questions won’t be charged
a monthly fee, Owen said.
