             Colonial Pipeline Co., which
operates the largest pipeline linking U.S. Gulf Coast refiners
to East Coast markets, is limiting shipments on Line 20.  
 Nominations for cycle 41 will be allocated on the line,
which runs from Atlanta to Nashville, as they were approaching
levels that would exceed the line’s ability to deliver on a
five-day cycle, Colonial said in a bulletin to shippers.  
 Companies will be able to ship a prorated portion of the
original nomination, based on their shipping history over the
past year, according to Colonial.  
 The pipeline ships products in five-day cycles that run
back to back. When the pipeline is full, refiners may have to
sell excess supply into the Gulf Coast market, which can depress
spot prices.
