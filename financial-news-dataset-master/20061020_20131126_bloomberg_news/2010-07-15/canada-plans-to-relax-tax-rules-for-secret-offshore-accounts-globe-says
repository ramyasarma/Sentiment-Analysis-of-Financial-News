             Canadian tax collectors are
preparing to relax tax rules for people who confess to having
secret offshore accounts, the Globe and Mail reported, citing
people it didn’t identify.  
 The Canada Revenue Agency has been drafting requirements
for its new voluntary disclosure program for the past few
months, the Toronto-based newspaper said. Auditors will now only
go back a maximum of 10 years when determining what the
government is owed instead of the entire history of the revealed
funds, the Globe reported.  
 The changes are being made to bring Canada more in line
with a clemency program used in the United States, the Globe
said.
