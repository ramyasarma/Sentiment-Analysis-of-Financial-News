             South Africa appointed  Pitso Mosimane  as its sixteenth soccer coach in 18 years following the
resignation of former Brazilian World Cup winning coach  Carlos Alberto Parreira .  
 The announcement was made by  Kirsten Nematandani , president
of the South African Football Association, at a press conference
in Johannesburg today. South Africa was readmitted into FIFA,
soccer’s governing body, in 1992 after the end of apartheid.  
 Mosimane was Parreira’s assistant at the soccer World Cup,
where the team was eliminated in the first round, after
finishing with four points.  
 Before becoming Parreira’s assistant, the former soccer
player Mosimane coached local club-side Supersport United. He
played professional football in Greece for Ionikos for six years
and played for two local clubs Jomo Cosmos and Mamelodi
Sundowns.  
 South Africa moved 17 places higher to number 66 in the
world ranking by FIFA. Spain is first, ahead of Netherlands and
Brazil.
