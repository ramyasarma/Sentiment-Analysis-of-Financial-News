             Tin, this year’s best performer on
the London Metal Exchange, may rise as much as 21 percent to
$21,708 a metric ton in the next few months, according to
technical analysis by Sucden Financial Ltd.  
 The metal, used mostly to make electrical solders, may
advance to as high as $21,708 a ton, a 76 percent retracement of
the drop between May and December 2008, according to Brenda
Sullivan, a technical analyst at Sucden in London. That level is
singled out in so-called Fibonacci analysis.  
 The attached chart shows prices have to climb above a
resistance level of $18,388 a ton, and the next targets would be
the April high of $19,300 and then $19,464, she said. The
$19,464 priced is a 62 percent retracement of the 2008 decline.  
 “Once we get above about $18,400, tin could actually go to
fresh highs,” Sullivan said. “We are watching very closely
from our side, this week and next week, the path of tin to see
if we do get some of these breakouts.”  
 Tin for delivery in three months traded at $18,000 a ton at
8:02 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange. Prices are up 6.2
percent this year, heading for a second annual advance.  
 Supply disruptions in Indonesia, the world’s largest tin
exporter, have tightened the market, according to Sucden analyst
 Steve Hardcastle . Outbound shipments of refined metal by volume
dropped from a year earlier for a third time in four months in
May, figures released on June 15 showed.  
 “We are looking for a very, very strong performance,”
Hardcastle said during the presentation. Demand for tin has
increased this year, he said.  
 Prices also have been helped by this year’s 40 percent drop
in  stockpiles  tracked by the LME, the biggest decline for the
six main metals traded on the exchange. Inventories have slid to
16,160 tons, the lowest level since June 16, 2009.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.
