             Hunan Boyun New Materials Co. plans
to form a venture with Honeywell International Inc. to produce
braking systems and wheels for China’s first narrow-body
passenger jet, the Chinese company said in a statement to
Shenzhen’s stock exchange.  
 The company based in the city of Changsha plans to raise
about 500 million yuan via the private placement of as many as
35 million shares, it said. About 300 million yuan of the funds
will be used for the project with Honeywell, Hunan Boyun said.  
 The venture with Honeywell will have an estimated $90
million of registered capital, Hunan Boyun said. The Chinese
company plans to hold a 49 percent stake in the venture, with
Honeywell controlling the remaining 51 percent, according to the
statement.
