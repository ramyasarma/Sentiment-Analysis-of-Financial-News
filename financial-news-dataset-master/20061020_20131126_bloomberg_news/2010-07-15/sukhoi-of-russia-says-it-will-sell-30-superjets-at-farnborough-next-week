             Sukhoi Co., maker of
Russia’s first post-Soviet passenger airplane, said it plans to
sign a “firm contract” to sell 30 SuperJets to a customer from
Southeast Asia next week.  
 The Moscow-based company said the deal will be sealed at
the  Farnborough International Airshow , which starts July 19 and
runs for a week, in a statement received by e-mail today.  
 “This will be our biggest foreign contract for planes that
have a catalogue price of $31.7 million each,” Sukhoi
spokeswoman  Olga Kayukova  said in a phone interview today.  
 Sukhoi Chief Executive Officer  Mikhail Pogosyan  said June
11 the company will supply the first three of its SuperJet
passenger airplanes this year as Russia seeks to challenge
Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. in the mid-range market. SuperJet is
Russia’s first major passenger airplane project since the
collapse of the Soviet Union.  
 The contract is worth a total of $1 billion, according to
 Konstantin Makienko , deputy director of the Center for Analysis
of Strategies and Technologies, adding the deal may be agreed
with a buyer from Vietnam, Indonesia or Malaysia.  
 The contract will “greatly reinforce the position of
Sukhoi in the commercial aviation market, which is highly
competitive for mid-range aircraft,” Makienko said.
