             U.S. sales of  Nintendo Co. ’s DS
handheld video-game player fell by a third in June amid an
overall decline in U.S. video-game sales to $1.17 billion.  
 Nintendo also sold 422,500 Wii consoles in the U.S. in
June, a 16 percent gain from a year earlier, researcher NPD Inc.
said today in a statement. Sales of  Sony Corp. ’s PlayStation 3
jumped 85 percent to 304,800 units in June, while those of
 Microsoft Corp. ’s Xbox 360 gained 88 percent to 451,700 units.
Total industry sales declined 6 percent, led by falling game
purchases, NPD said.  
 Nintendo DS sales tumbled 39 percent in May after the
Kyoto-based company said it is introducing a new version
equipped with three cameras, a wireless connection and a screen
that displays 3-D images without the use of special glasses.
