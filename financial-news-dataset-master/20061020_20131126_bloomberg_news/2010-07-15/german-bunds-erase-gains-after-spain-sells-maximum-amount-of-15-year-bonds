             German 10-year government bonds
erased their gains after Spain sold 3 billion euros ($3.8
billion) of 15-year securities, the maximum targeted amount.  
 The yield on benchmark German bunds was one basis point
higher at 2.67 percent as of 9:47 a.m. in London, after earlier
falling to 2.63 percent.
