             Credit-default swaps protecting
against losses on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bonds fell after a
report the bank reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.                               
 Five-year contracts on New York-based Goldman declined
about 4 basis points to a mid-price of 167 basis points,
according to data provider CMA. The contracts had been trading
at 177 basis points before CNBC reported the bank had reached a
settlement over fraud allegations, according to broker Phoenix
Partners Group.
