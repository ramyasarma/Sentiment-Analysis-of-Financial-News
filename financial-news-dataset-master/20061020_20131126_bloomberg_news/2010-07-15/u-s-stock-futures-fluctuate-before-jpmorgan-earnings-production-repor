             U.S. stocks fell, sending the Dow
Jones Industrial Average lower for the first time in eight days,
after a slowdown in New York-region manufacturing growth and a
report that showed China’s economic growth is moderating.  
 Bank of America Corp., Intel Corp. and 3M Co. led the Dow
lower. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the first of the largest U.S. banks
to post second-quarter results, rose 0.1 percent after earnings
topped estimates.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.1 percent to
1,094.29 as of 9:37 a.m. in New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  fell 14.38 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,352.34.  
 Stock-index futures pared their advance after a gauge of
New York manufacturing trailed economists’ estimates,
overshadowing a bigger-than-forecast decrease in jobless claims.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic index
dropped to 5.1, lower than the median forecast of 18 in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. Readings greater than zero
signal expansion in the so-called Empire State Index that covers
New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut.  
 Initial jobless claims dropped by 29,000 to 429,000 in the
week ended July 10, the fewest since August 2008, the Labor
Department said. The government anticipates an increase in
temporary factory layoffs in early July that did not occur this
year, leading to the decrease in applications, a Labor
Department spokesman said.  
 Rally Falters  
 U.S. stocks halted a six-day rally yesterday after Intel
Corp.’s record profit forecast was overshadowed by a drop in
retail sales and the Federal Reserve’s assessment that the
economy has “softened.”  
 The benchmark S&P 500 rebounded more than 7 percent from a
10-month low on July 2 through yesterday amid optimism about
second-quarter results. Analysts predict earnings in the S&P 500
grew 34 percent last quarter, according to Bloomberg data.  
 JPMorgan climbed 0.1 percent to $40.39. The U.S. bank
posted a 76 percent  rise  in second-quarter profit to $4.8
billion, or $1.09 a share, beating an  average  estimate for
adjusted earnings of 71 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 JPMorgan said it bought back $500 million in shares through
yesterday after receiving approval from regulators to return
some capital to shareholders.

                          July 15 (Bloomberg) -- Anton Schutz, president of Mendon Capital Advisors Corp., discusses JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s announcement that it bought back $500 million in shares through yesterday.
     JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said second-quarter profit rose 76 percent, more than analysts estimated, as a reduction in provisions for soured mortgages and credit-card loans buoyed results. Schutz speaks with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television’s “InsideTrack.” (This is an excerpt of the full interview. Source: Bloomberg)
