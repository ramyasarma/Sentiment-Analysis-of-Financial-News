             China’s managed float of the yuan
exchange rate will help curb inflation and asset bubbles and
reduce overdependence on exports, Deputy Governor Hu Xiaolian,
said in a statement on the website of the People’s Bank of
China.  
 The managed float policy will help keep the currency
stable, Hu said.
