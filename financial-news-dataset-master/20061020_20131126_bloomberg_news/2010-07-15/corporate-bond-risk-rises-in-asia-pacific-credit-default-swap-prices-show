             The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
bonds from default increased, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan jumped 4 basis points to 125 basis
points as of 8:17 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Credit
Agricole CIB. That’s the highest since July 12, according to
CMA.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index added 4 basis points to
122 as of 8:51 a.m. in Sydney, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.
The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 0.5 basis point to 124 as of
9:11 a.m. in Tokyo, Morgan Stanley prices show.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of credit quality and a drop shows improvement. The swap
contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
