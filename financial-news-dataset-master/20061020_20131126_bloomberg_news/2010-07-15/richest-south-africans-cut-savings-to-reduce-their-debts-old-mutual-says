             Old Mutual Plc , the biggest insurer
in Africa, said the richest South Africans cut their savings
this year to reduce debt levels as interest  rates  declined.  
 The top earners in Africa’s largest economy “are saving
less,”  Crispin Sonn , director of corporate affairs at Old
Mutual in South Africa, said in the text of a presentation in
Johannesburg today. “We’re not saving more because we have too
much mid- to long-term debt.”  
 Household debt eased to 78.4 percent of disposable income
in the first quarter, down from 79.9 percent in the previous
three months, South Africa’s central bank said on June 24. The
country’s top earners are using a 5.5 percentage-point reduction
in interest rates since December, 2008, to pay off mortgages,
personal loans and cars while those with little or no debt
haven’t significantly increased their savings, Sonn said.  
 “South African households save way too little,” Rian le
Roux, head of economic research for the Old Mutual Investment
Group, said in a  note . “Most assume their pension funds will
provide sufficient retirement capital, but few ever bother to
check whether this is true.”  
 Old Mutual, the London-based company that began selling
insurance policies to South Africans in 1845, said its  Old
Mutual Savings Monitor  does a twice yearly survey of South
African savings behavior in cities, which aims to “foster a
culture of saving.”
