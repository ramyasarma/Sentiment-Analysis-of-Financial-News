             Brazil’s tax collection and job
creation results for June were below economists’ forecasts,
signaling growth has slowed since the economy expanded at the
 fastest pace  in 15 years in the first quarter.  
 Brazil’s economy created 212,952  government-registered  jobs
in June, less than the median of three forecasts of economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg for 279,000 jobs. The figures compare with
298,041 registered jobs created in May, the Labor Ministry said
in a report distributed today in Brasilia.  
 The government collected 61.5 billion reais ($35 billion)
in taxes last month, missing the 64 billion-real median  forecast 
of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The figures compare with
54 billion reais in the same month last year, the tax agency
said in a report distributed today in Brasilia.  
 “The less-than-expected tax collection figure increases
the risk that the government won’t deliver fiscal results this
year,” said  Diego Donadio , senior Latin America analyst at BNP
Paribas in Sao Paulo. “If the government doesn’t slow the pace
of spending, it increases the risk that the central bank will
have to raise  interest rates .”  
 Latin America’s biggest economy expanded at the fastest
pace since 1995 in the first quarter, prompting policy makers to
raise the benchmark interest rate in two consecutive meetings to
10.25 percent from a record low of 8.75 percent in March.  Retail
sales  and  industrial production  also missed estimates in May,
signaling a slowdown.  
 The real erased an earlier gain and fell 0.3 percent to
1.7684 per U.S. dollar at 11:35 a.m. New York time, from 1.7625
yesterday. The yield on the interest-rate future contract due
January, the most traded in BM&F Bovespa stock exchange today,
fell six basis points to 11.15 percent.  
 The pace of Brazil’s economic expansion will ease in the
third quarter after the government withdrew stimulus measures
including tax cuts, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told
reporters in Brasilia yesterday. The central bank’s seasonally
adjusted economic activity index fell to 139.55 points in May
from 139.58 points in April, also pointing for lower growth.  
 Brazil’s service sector accounted for roughly a third of
all new formal jobs created in the country in the first six
months of the year, Labor Minister  Carlos Lupi  told reporters in
Brasilia today.  
 Lupi today said that 490,028 new posts were created in
services in Brazil in the first half of 2010. Lupi yesterday
said that about 1.5 million formal jobs had been created in
Brazil in the first half of 2010, a record for the period.  
 The government-registered job creation number is a balance
of posts created minus job eliminated. Registered jobs, so-
called formal work, assure employees a range of benefits such as
unemployment insurance, bonuses and retirement payments by the
government.
