             India adopted a graphic symbol for
the rupee, joining the U.S., the U.K., Europe and Japan, in a
bid to project its currency as an icon of the economy’s growing
importance in the world.  
 The South Asian nation’s cabinet today approved the sign,
selected from applications received at a competition held by the
government, Information & Broadcasting Minister  Ambika Soni  told
reporters in New Delhi. The  symbol  will also help distinguish
the Indian rupee from the similarly-named currencies of Pakistan,
Nepal, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, she said.  
 “The symbol for the rupee would lend a distinctive
character and identity to the currency and further highlight the
strength and robustness of the Indian economy as a favored
destination for global investments,” Soni said.  
 Growth in the South Asian nation’s $1.2 trillion economy,
which averaged 8.5 percent in the past five years, may exceed 10
percent in the next five years, Finance Minister Pranab
Mukherjee said on June 22. That prospect spurred foreign
investors to boost holdings of Indian bonds and shares to all-
time highs of  $14.95 billion  and  $81 billion , respectively, this
week, data from the  Securities and Exchange Board of India  show.  
 “India’s role on the global stage is increasing and its
financial markets are growing bigger and deeper,” said  Rahul Bajoria , a Singapore-based economist at Barclays Plc, the
world’s third-largest currency trader. “The rupee symbol is
recognition of the ever-increasing economic linkages between
India and the world.”  
 The finance ministry selected the currency sign after
short-listing five from entries received in a competition
announced last year, according to information on its web site.
The government had recommended in the contest guidelines that
the symbol should represent India’s history and culture and must
be acceptable across the country.
