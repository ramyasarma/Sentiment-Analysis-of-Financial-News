             Canadian stocks  fell, erasing a
weekly gain, as material producers and financial shares slid on
declining U.S. consumer confidence and a drop in profit at Bank
of America Corp.  
 Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer, lost 1.9
percent as the precious metal retreated the most in two weeks on
a stronger euro. EnCana Corp., Canada’s largest natural gas
producer, dropped 2.5 percent as the fuel fell in New York and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its  rating . Royal Bank of Canada,
the country’s biggest bank, slipped 1.7 percent.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  decreased 172.12
points, or 1.5 percent, to 11,569.65, down 0.8 point for the
week. The plunge wiped out a 121-point gain from the last 34
minutes of trading yesterday, which happened after BP Plc halted
its oil spill, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
scheduled a press conference on its fraud settlement with
Goldman Sachs and the financial regulatory overhaul passed the
U.S. Senate.  
 “There were three elements of uncertainty that were
seeming to come to a conclusion, which was a knee-jerk”
reaction, said  Danielle Park , who helps manage C$200 million
($190 million) as a money manager at Venable Park Investment
Counsel Inc. in Barrie, Ontario. “The reality is it’s just a
very challenging climate continuing, with pressure more
pronounced on the energy and financial sectors as they are
forced to account for and clean up some of the damage they
caused.”  
 The S&P/TSX gained 5.9 percent from July 5 to yesterday as
crude oil surged 6.5 percent. The fuel rallied amid optimism the
earnings-reporting season that began July 12 will show improved
prospects for economic recovery.  
 Banks Drop  
 The S&P/TSX Financials Index dropped the most this month
after the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of  consumer sentiment  for July fell to 66.5 from 76 last
month, below the forecasts of all 62 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Bank of America, North America’s biggest bank, reported
declines in profit and revenue for the second quarter.  
 Royal Bank dropped 1.7 percent to C$54.09. Bank of Nova
Scotia, Canada’s  third-biggest bank , declined 1.4 percent to
C$51.71. Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s third-largest
insurer, lost 2.7 percent to C$15.31.  
 Mortgage insurer Genworth MI Canada Inc. rallied 5.7
percent to C$24.39 after saying it will buy back as much as
C$325 million of its shares at C$24 to C$28 each.  
 Debt Concerns Ease  
 S&P/TSX  gold stocks  decreased as the euro fluctuated after
three days of gains. Investor concern over sovereign debt in
Europe has diminished this week with a successful government
bond sale in Spain.  
 Barrick retreated 1.9 percent to C$44. Goldcorp Inc.,
Canada’s second-largest gold producer, fell 1.4 percent to
C$42.44. Gammon Gold Inc., which mines in Mexico, dropped 6.3
percent to C$5.63 after soaring  9.5 percent  yesterday on a
production increase.  
 Crude oil declined for a third day in New York, while
natural gas retreated after surging 6.5 percent yesterday.
Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
slipped 1.6 percent to C$32.33. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.,
the country’s second-biggest energy company by market value,
lost 1.6 percent to C$36.42.  
 EnCana slumped 2.5 percent to C$33.59 after Goldman Sachs
analyst  Brian Singer  cut its rating to “sell” from
“neutral.” Of analysts in a Bloomberg survey, Singer is the
first to label EnCana with a sell or equivalent rating since
2008.  
 Estimate Cut  
 Oil and gas producers Nexen Inc. and Bankers Petroleum Ltd.
retreated on comments from Bank of Montreal analysts.  
 Nexen tumbled 4.9 percent to C$21.22 after  Randy Ollenberger  reduced his rating on the shares to “market
perform” from “outperform,” citing what he called a slow
ramp-up at the Long Lake oil sands project. Bankers Petroleum
decreased 4.3 percent to C$7.09 after  Christopher Brown  cut his
near-term share-price estimate to C$10 from C$10.50 to account
for the company’s C$100 million equity financing, which closed
yesterday.  
 BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. sank 4.3 percent
to C$55.41 after Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs
said his company will give iPhone 4 buyers rubberized cases to
solve a reception glitch rather than recall the smartphones. RIM
shares had climbed 13 percent from July 2 to yesterday as
complaints mounted about the rival device.  
 Biovail Corp., the drugmaker  merging  with Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International, jumped 5.1 percent to C$21.66,
the highest price in almost three years.  
 Piper Jaffray Cos. analyst  David Amsellem  raised his rating
on the company to “overweight” from “neutral” and increased
his 12-month price estimate on the company’s U.S.-listed shares
to $25 from $16.50. Amsellem told clients in a note his old
share-price forecast miscalculated the effects of the Valeant
deal on the combined company’s stock.
