             Alzheimer’s disease patients who
switched to  Pfizer Inc.  and  Eisai Co. NPG45T8UG6CD"></a> were more likely to maintain or improve brain function
than those who continued using an older formulation, a study
found.  
 People with more advanced Alzheimer’s benefited the most
from the experimental, 23-milligram tablet taken once daily,
compared with the immediate-release, 10-milligram pill now used,
according to the results released today at the  International
Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease NPG45T8UG6CD"></a>, to buffer a potential sales decline when the
medicine loses patent protection in the U.S. in November. The
company, which generates 60 percent of Aricept’s global sales in
the U.S., expects the drug’s revenue in that market to fall
about 50 percent in the year ending March 2012, it said in
March.  
 The new formulation is being reviewed by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, which will make a decision by July 24. It
plans to submit data this quarter for regulatory approval to
sell the patch version. Eisai aims for the long-acting version
of Aricept to reach more than $600 million in peak sales.  
 The study  involved 1,467 people who had moderate to severe
Alzheimer’s disease and underwent treatment with the immediate-
release Aricept pill for more than three months. Patients then
took placebo and either the immediate-release or extended-
release pill for six months.  
 Aricept sales  for Eisai rose 6.3 percent to 322.8 billion
yen ($3.64 billion) in the year ended March 31, accounting for
40 percent of revenue. The Japanese company pays New York-based
Pfizer a fee for co-promotion of Aricept in the U.S. and parts
of Europe.
