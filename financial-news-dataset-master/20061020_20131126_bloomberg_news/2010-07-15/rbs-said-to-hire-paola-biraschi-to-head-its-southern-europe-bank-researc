             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
hired Nomura International Plc analyst  Paola Biraschi  to head
its southern European banking equity research team in London,
according to two people familiar with the situation.  
 Biraschi resigned at the end of June, said the people, who
asked not be identified because the appointment hasn’t been made
public. She will start at RBS in September, according to one of
the people.  
 Biraschi joined Lehman Brothers in 2001, remaining at the
firm after its purchase by Nomura in 2008. At Nomura, Biraschi
covered Italian banks including  UniCredit SpA , Intesa Sanpaolo
SpA, Banco Popolare SC and Mediobanca SpA.  
 Before joining Lehman, Biraschi worked as a research
analyst for Fox-Pitt Kelton’s European team. Biraschi, 35, has a
degree in economics from Bocconi University in Milan.  
 A spokesman at RBS in London declined to comment. An
official at Nomura confirmed that Biraschi left the company.
