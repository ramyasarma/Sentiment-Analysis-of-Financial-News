             Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. 
hired  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.  advise on its
$3.2 billion purchase of Dimension Data Plc, the biggest deal
for the investment-banking venture since it was formed in May.  
 Morgan Stanley  and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. are
advising the country’s largest phone company on its cash
acquisition of South Africa-based Dimension, said Keiko Ouchi, a
Tokyo-based spokeswoman for NTT.  
 Mitsubishi UF, Japan’s largest publicly traded bank, and
New York-based Morgan Stanley teamed up in investment banking
this year to take a larger share of mergers advisory fees.
Mitsubishi UFJ invested $9 billion in the Wall Street firm in
2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  
 “It’s epoch-making for Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ
to handle a big deal on the other side of the world, just after
completing their joint venture,” said  Shiro Yoshioka , a Tokyo-
based analyst at Japanivest Group Plc.  
 Mitsubishi UFJ’s banking unit will finance NTT’s purchase,
NTT said in a statement filed to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  
 The NTT deal will make Morgan Stanley the third-ranked
adviser on mergers and acquisitions this year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Mitsubishi UFJ last week completed the transfer
of almost 300 bankers to Morgan Stanley’s local headquarters in
Tokyo’s Ebisu district, said  Hiroshi Kutose , a spokesman at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley.  
 Fumiyuki Akikusa , the venture’s chief executive officer,
said in May that 100 Morgan Stanley bankers working out of the
Ebisu office will handle cross-border mergers advisory and
equity finance. The investment-banking venture has about 6,800
employees and is based in Tokyo’s Marunouchi district.
