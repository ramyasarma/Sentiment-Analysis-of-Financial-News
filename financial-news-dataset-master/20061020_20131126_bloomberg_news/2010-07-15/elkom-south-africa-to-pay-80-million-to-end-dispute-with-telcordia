             Telkom South Africa Ltd. , Africa’s
largest fixed-line phone company, said it will pay U.S. software
maker Telcordia Technologies Inc. $80 million to settle a nine-
year dispute over a canceled contract.  
 The companies reached an agreement based on an arbitration
ruling, Pretoria-based Telkom said in a statement today. Telkom
made a provision of $77 million for the dispute in March.  
 The dispute arose in 2001 when Telkom terminated a contract
placed with Telcordia for the supply of a customer-care
management system. Telcordia claimed damages of $128 million
plus interest at a rate of 15.5 percent annually.  
 Telkom gained  65 cents, or 2 percent, to 33.50 rand in
Johannesburg, giving the company a market value of 17.4 billion
rand ($2.3 billion).  
 Telcordia, based in Piscataway, New Jersey, was acquired in
2005 by private-equity firms Providence Equity Partners
Inc. and Warburg Pincus LLC from Science Applications
International Corp., according to the software maker’s website.
The company is led by  Mark Greenquist , a former auto-industry
executive.
