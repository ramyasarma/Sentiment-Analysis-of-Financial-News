             The Bank of Italy raised its growth
forecast for Europe’s fourth-biggest economy this year, saying
 export gains  will drive the recovery as rising unemployment
weighs on domestic demand.  
 Italy’s  gross domestic product  will expand 1 percent, more
than the 0.7 percent predicted in January, the Rome-based
central bank said today in a report. The country’s  joblessness 
will keep rising “to about 9 percent,” it also said. That’s
higher than the 8.4 percent in the first quarter.  
 Italy’s growth “will be supported by foreign demand as in
similar economic cycles in the past,” the bank said. “The
reviving vigor of exports has not been coupled with an
improvement in domestic demand.”  
 The $2.1 trillion economy expanded less than economists
originally forecast in the first quarter as weak consumption
limited gains in exports, which were helped by the decline of
the euro in the period. The currency’s slump was fueled by
investors concerns that Greece’s near-default signaled a
spreading regional debt crisis. The Italian Senate today passed
measures to reduce the country’s budget deficit as part of a
coordinated austerity plan in the euro region.  
 Bank of Italy Governor  Mario Draghi  said today in a speech
delivered at the Italian Banker’s Association in Rome that the
impact of the government’s budget cuts, worth 25 billion euros
($32 billion) over the next two years, can only be gauged in the
“coming months.”  
 The Bank of Italy kept its growth forecast for Italy next
year at 1 percent, according to today’s report.
