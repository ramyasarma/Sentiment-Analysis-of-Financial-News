             Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc.  agreed to assume liabilities tied to asbestos and pollution
claims from commercial insurer  CNA Financial Corp.  in exchange
for a $2 billion fee.  
 Berkshire will assume about $1.6 billion of net liabilities
in the deal, which is expected to be completed this quarter,
Chicago-based CNA said today in a statement distributed by
Business Wire. CNA said it expects a loss of about $375 million
on the reinsurance transaction.  
 Buffett is taking the risk on claims that could take years
to resolve in exchange for fee income and access to insurance
reserves that he can invest. In 2006, Berkshire agreed to assume
asbestos risks previously held by Lloyd’s of London investors in
exchange for about $7 billion. The company’s  financial strength 
allowed Buffett, 79, to negotiate favorable terms from CNA, said
 Meyer Shields , an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co.  
 “There’s no other insurance entity out there that can
present the same level of security” as Berkshire, Shields said
in an interview. “And that level of security is reflected in
the significant underwriting profit Berkshire is getting,” he
said, referring to the difference between the assets Berkshire
will receive and the liabilities it agreed to assume.  
 Berkshire’s National Indemnity Co. will take responsibility
for handling claims and may be able to collect reinsurance with
a book value of about $200 million from third parties. The
liabilities have a limit of $4 billion, and National Indemnity
will deposit $2.2 billion in a collateral trust for the benefit
of CNA, according to the statement.  
 Underwriting, Investing  
 Buffett  built  Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire over four
decades as chief executive officer by investing the premium
generated by insurance units. Berkshire sells car coverage
through Geico Corp. and protection for other carriers through
its General Re subsidiary. Last year, insurance underwriting and
investing  accounted  for about 30 percent of Berkshire’s revenue
and 61 percent of its profit, according to Bloomberg data.  
 CNA, which is  majority owned  by Loews Corp., hired  Thomas Motamed  from Chubb Corp. last year as the company recovered from
its first annual loss in five years in 2008. The insurers that
cede risk through reinsurance can refocus on selling new
policies.  
 “This transaction is consistent with our focus on
financial stability and delivering improved levels of operating
consistency as we effectively eliminate a significant source of
uncertainty from these legacy liabilities,” Motamed said in the
statement.  
 Berkshire holds the second-highest credit grade at Standard
& Poor’s and the third-highest at Moody’s Investors Service. CNA
has the No. 10 rating at Moody’s.  
 CNA slipped 24 cents to $26.98 at 9:32 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Berkshire advanced $124 to
$119,144.
