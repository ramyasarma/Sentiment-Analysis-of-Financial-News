             Air New Zealand Ltd ., the nation’s
largest carrier, denied a report it has bought a stake in Virgin
Blue Holdings Ltd. as the two airlines await a ruling on a
proposed alliance.  
 Air New Zealand is conscious that alliances such as the one
planned with  Virgin Blue , Australia’s second-largest carrier,
frequently include an equity aspect, but their proposal does not
do so, it said in a statement. The Sydney Morning Herald today
reported the New Zealand carrier may be preparing to buy as much
as 15 percent of Virgin, citing people it didn’t name.  
 Air New Zealand and Virgin are seeking approval from
regulators for an alliance on their services between New Zealand
and Australia. Co-operation may help the carriers compete with
Qantas Airways Ltd. and Emirates on routes flown by more than 5
million passengers a year.  
 The necessary regulatory approvals are still in process and
Air New Zealand has had no indication of the outcome of this
decision, the airline said. A final decision on the alliance is
expected by the end of the year.  
 Air New Zealand said it would need Australian government
approval to buy any shares in Virgin Blue because the New
Zealand government is a 77 percent shareholder.
