             U.S. stock-index futures trimmed
gains after a gauge of New York manufacturing trailed
economists’ estimates, overshadowing a bigger-than-forecast
decrease in jobless claims.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September rose 0.2 percent to 1,093.3 at 8:33 a.m. in New York
after rallying as much as 0.7 percent earlier. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures climbed 0.1 percent to 10,319,
trimming a 0.5 percent advance.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index dropped to 5.1, lower than the median forecast of 18 in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. Readings greater than zero
signal expansion in the so-called Empire State Index that covers
New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut.  
 Initial jobless claims dropped by 29,000 to 429,000 in the
week ended July 10, the fewest since August 2008, Labor
Department figures showed today in Washington. The government
anticipates an increase in temporary factory layoffs in early
July that did not occur this year, leading to the decrease in
applications, a Labor Department spokesman said.
