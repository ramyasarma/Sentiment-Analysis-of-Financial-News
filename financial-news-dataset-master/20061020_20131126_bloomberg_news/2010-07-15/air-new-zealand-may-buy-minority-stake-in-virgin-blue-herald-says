             Air New Zealand Ltd. may buy a
cornerstone stake in Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd., the Sydney
Morning Herald reported, citing people it didn’t name.  
 The Auckland-based airline may buy as much as 15 percent of
Virgin, which is Australia’s second biggest carrier, the
newspaper said. The two airlines appear to have won indicative
support from regulators for their proposed joint venture on
services between New Zealand and Australia, the Herald said
without saying where it got the information.
