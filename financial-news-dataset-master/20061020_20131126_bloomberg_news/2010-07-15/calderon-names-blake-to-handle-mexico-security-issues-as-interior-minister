             Mexican President  Felipe Calderon 
named his fourth Interior Minister in four years, appointing
Jose Francisco Blake Mora, the secretary general of Baja
California state, to replace Fernando Gomez Mont.  
 Calderon also named  Bruno Ferrari , who headed the country’s
investment promotion authority known as Promexico, to replace
 Gerardo Ruiz Mateos  as economy minister. Ruiz Mateos will return
to the president’s office to be chief of staff, a position he
held before being named minister in 2008.  
 Blake Mora, 44, was the second-in-command after the
governor in Baja California state and served as a federal
congressman between 2000 and 2003. Mexico’s interior minister
post is traditionally a powerful position that handles security
matters as well as negotiations with other political parties.  
 Blake, who is from the violence-plagued city of Tijuana,
played a “fundamental” role in confronting organized crime in
Baja California, said Calderon, who served as a lawmaker during
the same period as Blake.  
 “This will be of great help in carrying out the fight
against organized crime,” Calderon said.  
 Calderon urged Blake to push through legislation to change
term limits and to maintain dialogue with state governors.
Blake, who spoke after Calderon, pledged to seek dialogue
between political parties.  
 Ferrari, 48, is a lawyer who earned his degree at the
Mexico City-based Escuela Libre de Derecho.
