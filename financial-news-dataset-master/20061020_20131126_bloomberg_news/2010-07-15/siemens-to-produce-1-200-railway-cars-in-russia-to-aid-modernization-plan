             Siemens AG, the German maker of the
ICE high-speed train, will produce 1,200 railway cars in Russia
this decade as President  Dmitry Medvedev  seeks to modernize the
country’s infrastructure, OAO Russian Railways Chief Executive
Officer  Vladimir Yakunin  said.  
 Russian Railways, the country’s rail monopoly, will sign
the purchase agreement with Siemens today, during talks between
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev, Yakunin said in an interview late yesterday.  
 Russia, the world’s largest energy exporter, is seeking
help from western companies to upgrade its sprawling but worn
out infrastructure and diversify the economy. Medvedev said July
12 that Russia should create “modernization alliances” with
countries such as Germany, France, Italy and the U.S., putting
its foreign policy on a more pragmatic footing.
