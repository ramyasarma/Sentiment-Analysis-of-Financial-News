             Three-month euroyen futures rose,
sending yields to the lowest in a week, after the minutes of
last month’s Federal Reserve’s meeting prompted concerns that
slower U.S. growth may lead to additional monetary stimulus.  
 Euroyen contracts for March delivery rose 0.015 point to
99.700 on the Tokyo Financial Exchange, pushing down implied
yields to 0.30 percent, the lowest since July 6.  
 The minutes, released yesterday, indicate U.S. central
bankers were concerned about lingering high unemployment and
risks that inflation could decelerate further. If the outlook
worsened, the Federal Open Market Committee would need to
consider whether additional stimulus was appropriate, the
minutes said.
