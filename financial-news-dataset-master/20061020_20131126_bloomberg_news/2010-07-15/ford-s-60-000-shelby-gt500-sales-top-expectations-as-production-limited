             Ford Motor Co. ’s Shelby GT500, a
550-horsepower version of its Mustang sports car, is selling at
a faster pace than the company expected for prices that can top
$60,000.  
 More than 3,300 orders for the company’s priciest sports
car have been received since April, Dearborn, Michigan-based
Ford said today in a statement. That represents 60 percent of
the 5,500 Shelbys that Ford said it plans to build this year.
The 2011 Shelby GT500 ranges from $49,495 to $60,500.  
 “We are pleased with the pace of retail orders,” Fritz
Wilke, the Mustang brand manager, said in the statement. “The
limited production of the 2011 should make this year even more
desirable.”  
 The Mustang has been in a sales race with General Motors
Co.’s Chevrolet Camaro in a rivalry that dates to the late
1960s. This year through June, the Camaro leads with 46,378
sales in the U.S. to the Mustang’s 40,035. The Mustang has held
the annual sports-car sales crown in the U.S. since 1986.  
 Ford said it is limiting the Shelby GT500’s production to
about half its 2007 sales peak “to ensure exclusivity.”  
 Most buyers are ordering options such as a $1,995 glass
roof, and almost 70 percent have chosen a $2,340 electronics
package that includes voice-activated navigation and HD radio,
Ford said. Almost 70 percent also have opted for the $3,495
“performance package” that includes special tires and tuning
to provide racecar handling, Ford said.  
 The Shelby GT500 is powered by a 5.4-liter V8 engine and
gets 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway. The coupe
version is priced from $49,495 to $57,532, and the convertible
ranges from $54,495 to $60,500.  
 Ford also offers a Mustang with a V6 engine that starts at
$22,145 and gets 19 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway.
The Mustang GT model with a 5.0-liter V8 starts at $30,495 and
gets 17 mpg in the city and 26 mpg in highway driving, according
to Ford.
