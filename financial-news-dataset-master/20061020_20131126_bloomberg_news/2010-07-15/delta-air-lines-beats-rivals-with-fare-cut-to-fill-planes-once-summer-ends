             Delta Air Lines Inc.  moved ahead of
UAL Corp.’s United Airlines and other competitors by offering a
fare sale to help fill its planes this fall, when demand
traditionally slows.  
 The sale, effective today for travel through Nov. 17, is
being offered earlier than last year, when Delta waited until
the end of July to discount fares for November and December. It
covers both domestic and international routes. Delta, based in
Atlanta, is the world’s biggest airline.  
 “Delta has a lot of airplanes out there, a lot of seats to
fill,”  Terry Trippler  of Rulestoknow.com, a  website  explaining
airline fare and airport travel rules. “They’re making a wise
move to say, ‘We’re going to fill the seats as soon as
possible.’”  
 Under the sale, a one-way fare between Chicago and New
York, purchased 21 days in advance, is $89. A ticket to fly from
Los Angeles to Sydney is priced at $429. Delta declined to
provide an average percentage discount in the fall promotion.  
 AMR Corp. ’s American Airlines matched the sale on competing
routes, said  Tim Smith , a spokesman for the Fort Worth, Texas-
based carrier.  
 The lack of major international business routes on the sale
indicates the airlines aren’t seeing a slowing of corporate
travelers, who generally pay higher fares, said  Dan McKenzie , a
Hudson Securities Inc. analyst in Chicago.  
 Tactical Move  
 The sale is a “more tactical and competitive move by Delta
to try and fill up seats so they can manage revenue on the back
end, as opposed to an indication of fall demand,” he said.
McKenzie recommends buying Delta.  
 U.S. airlines are expected to report their first quarterly
profit as a group in two and a half years starting next week.
Delta is scheduled to report results first, on July 19.  
 Southwest Airlines Co. , the largest low-fare carrier,
announced its own fall sale on June 22, also about two weeks
ahead of last year. The carrier “was trying to get customers to
book early and start thinking about fall travel a little earlier
in the summer,” said Ashley Dillon, a spokeswoman for Dallas-
based Southwest.  
 Delta fell 25 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $11.96 at 2:19 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
