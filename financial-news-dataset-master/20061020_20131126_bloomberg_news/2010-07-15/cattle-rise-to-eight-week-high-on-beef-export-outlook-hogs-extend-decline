             Cattle futures rose, extending a
rally to an eight-week high, on speculation that a decline in
the dollar will boost demand for U.S. beef exports. Hogs fell
for the fourth time in five sessions.  
 The  dollar  fell to a 10-week low against a basket of six
major currencies. In May, U.S. beef exports jumped 27 percent
from a year earlier, according to the most-recent government
data. In July, cattle prices have climbed 3.9 percent, heading
for the biggest monthly gain in a year.  
 “As the market watches the dollar slipping, it’s starting
to fuel some confidence” in cattle, said  Lawrence Kane , a
market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group in Elmwood, Illinois.
“Exports are a slow-building process, and they need confidence
that the dollar is stable.”  
 Cattle futures for October delivery advanced 0.175 cent, or
0.2 percent, to 93.575 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 94 cents, the highest level
for a most-active contract since May 14.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slipped 0.25
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.13375 a pound.  
 U.S. beef exports totaled 203.55 million pounds in May,
compared with 160.46 million a year earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  
 U.S. meat processors are paying more for animals as demand
grows. Slaughterhouses paid 93 cents a pound on average for
steers for immediate delivery this week, up 1.3 percent from a
week earlier and 12 percent more than a year earlier, USDA data
show.  
 “The cash trade really picked up,” said  Adam Stout , a
risk-management consultant at FCStone Group Inc. in Kansas City,
Missouri. “We went into the week expecting cash cattle to be
steady to a little weaker, so these prices are pretty
impressive.”  
 Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.475 cent, or 0.6
percent, to 75.325 cents a pound. The price has climbed 15
percent this year.
