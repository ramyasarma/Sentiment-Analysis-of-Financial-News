             Tropical Storm Conson is expected to
make landfall on China’s southern Hainan Island tomorrow
afternoon, bringing torrential rain and strong winds to coastal
and inland areas, the meteorological agency said.  
 The storm was about 400 kilometers (249 miles) southeast of
Hainan and was forecast to move at 15-20 kilometers an hour in a
northwesterly direction as of 5 p.m. in Shanghai, the China
Meteorological Administration said in a statement today.  
 Conson, which has left 23 people dead and damaged more than
3,000 homes in the Philippines, threatens to exacerbate
conditions in China where officials are warning of the worst
flooding in 12 years in the Yangtze river region. Floods across
southern China have already left at least 135 people dead and 41
missing since July 1, China’s official Xinhua News Agency
reported today.  
 Most of Hainan and coastal regions of Guangdong’s southwest
will have strong wind and heavy rain tomorrow as the storm
strengthens before reaching land, the meteorological agency said.  
 Regions in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu,
Zhejiang, Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang will also have
torrential rain within the next 24 hours, it said.  
 With Tropical Storm Conson arriving, flooding in China’s
Yangtze River basin may be as bad as in 1998, Wang Jingquan,
director of the flood control and drought relief office at the
Yangtze River Water Resources Committee, told Agence France-
Presse today.  
 In 1998, China had what it described as the worst floods in
44 years, including eight flood peaks that hit the 6,400-
kilometer regions along the Yangtze river. The floods in central
and northeastern China caused 166.6 billion yuan ($25 billion)
in damage, according to Xinhua.
