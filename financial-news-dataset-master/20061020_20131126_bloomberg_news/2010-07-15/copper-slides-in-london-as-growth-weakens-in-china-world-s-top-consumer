             Copper may fall in New York on
concern about weaker demand in China, the world’s biggest user,
after economic growth slowed and industrial production rose less
than estimated.  
 Gross domestic product expanded by 10.3 percent in the
second quarter, down from the prior three months. Factory output
gained 13.7 percent, less than all except one of 27 forecasts in
a Bloomberg News survey. Copper also slid after the Federal
Reserve yesterday cut its forecast for growth in the U.S., the
second-largest consumer of the metal.  
 “The Chinese data shows a clear slowdown,” said  Jesper Dannesboe , a strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. “But
we would expect the Chinese government to prevent the slowdown”
from continuing in the second half, he said.  
 Futures for September delivery rose 1.05 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $3.019 a pound at 8:05 a.m. on the Comex in New
York, erasing a decline of as much as 0.7 percent. Copper for
delivery in three months declined 0.7 percent to $6,680 a metric
ton on the London Metal Exchange.  
 GDP in China swelled by 11.9 percent in the first quarter.
Growth in the second quarter was less than the median estimate
of 10.5 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its full-year Chinese growth estimate
to 10 percent from 10.8 percent.  
 Weaker Dollar  
 Prices rebounded as the U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency
gauge of the dollar’s strength, fell for a third day, sliding as
much as 0.7 percent. A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-priced
metals cheaper in terms of other monies. The index’s 6.6 percent
gain this year has contributed to LME copper’s 9.5 percent drop.  
 “There has been a very close correlation very recently
between markets,”  Steve Hardcastle , an analyst at Sucden
Financial Ltd. in London, said at a presentation yesterday. “It
does affect physical trading, and it also affects the price
movements.”  
 The Fed lowered its forecast for growth this year in the
U.S. economy, the world’s biggest, to between 3 percent and 3.5
percent from the prior 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent.  
 A report from the Fed due at 9:15 a.m. Washington time
today probably will show that industrial production in the U.S.
fell in June for the first time in a year, economists said. A
0.1 percent decline, the median projection in a Bloomberg News
survey of 76 economists, would follow a 1.3 percent jump in May
that was the biggest in 10 months.  
 Falling Stockpiles  
 Copper also rebounded as inventories shrank further.
Stockpiles monitored by the LME fell for a 20th day to 427,725
tons, the lowest level since Nov. 23. They are down 15 percent
this year and headed for the first annual drop since 2004.
Bookings to remove metal from LME warehouses rose 11 percent,
the most in a month, to 31,575 tons.  
 “Tighter expected balances and declining inventories will
likely put upward pressure on key commodity prices and
returns,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by London-based
 Jeffrey Currie  said today in a report. Still, “policy risks in
Europe, China and the U.S. are likely to continue to generate
volatility and increase the risk of economic disappointments
over the short term,” they said.  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery on the LME rose 0.3
percent to $2,014 a ton. Immediate-delivery metal’s discount to
the three-month price, the so-called contango, narrowed to
$18.25 yesterday, the lowest closing level in almost a year and
down from $19.75 in the prior session.  
 “Financing deals are tightening up the market,”  William Adams , an analyst at Basemetals.com, said during the Sucden
presentation yesterday. Estimates are that about 80 percent of
aluminum stockpiles in LME warehouses are tied into financing
agreements, according to Sucden.  
 LME-monitored inventories of the lightweight metal have
dropped 5.3 percent this year to 4.38 million tons. Today they
gained after five declines in a row.  
 Lead slipped 0.1 percent to $1,826 a ton and nickel fell
0.1 percent to $19,380 a ton. Zinc was unchanged at $1,850 a ton
and tin rose 0.7 percent to $18,100 a ton.
