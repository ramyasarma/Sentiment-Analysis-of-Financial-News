             OAO AvtoVAZ , the Russian automaker
part-owned by France’s Renault SA, plans to sell new shares by
the end of 2012 to help fund the development of new models, the
head of parent company Russian Technologies Corp. said.  
 Renault will have to decide whether to buy stock in the
sale or contribute technology or some other asset if it wants to
maintain its stake, Russian Technologies Chief Executive Officer
 Sergei Chemezov  told reporters in the Ural Mountains city of
Yekaterinburg.  
 Renault in December 2007 agreed to pay $1 billion for 25
percent of AvtoVAZ. Renault, along with Nissan Motor Co., its 43
percent-owned Japanese affiliate, is planning to assemble a new
line of models for the Russian market at the AvtoVAZ plant in
Togliatti on the Volga River. The cars would be sold under all
three automakers’ brands.  
 Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  last month suggested a swap
in which the Russian and French government would exchange each
other’s shares in AvtoVAZ and Renault. Chemezov declined to
comment on that proposal today, saying the issue was still new.  
 Russia’s government has provided AvtoVAZ with more than 65
billion rubles ($2.1 billion )in emergency funding to avoid
bankruptcy after sales plunged last year as the economy
contracted a record 7.9 percent.
