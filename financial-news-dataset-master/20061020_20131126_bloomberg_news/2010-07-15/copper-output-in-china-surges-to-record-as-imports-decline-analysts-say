             Copper  production  by China, the
world’s largest metals consumer, gained to a record in June as
imports slumped and demand remained robust.  
 Output of the refined metal gained 26 percent to 422,000
metric tons, the statistics bureau said today. That’s a monthly
record, according to analysts.  
 Copper has fallen about 10 percent this year on concern
that weaker growth in China, budget cuts in Europe and limited
job gains in the U.S. may derail the global recovery. China’s
economic expansion eased to 10.3 percent in the second quarter,
the statistics bureau also reported today.  
 “The jump in output helped to offset the drop in imports
last month and signals demand by domestic consumers is still
good,” said  Fang Junfeng , an analyst at China International
Futures (Shanghai) Co. The metal is used to make wires and pipes.  
 China’s  imports  of copper fell for a third month in June,
dropping 17 percent to 328,231 tons, as concerns that the global
economic recovery may stall cut orders. That compares with May’s
396,712 tons, and is 31 percent lower than a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg calculations.  
 “Expectations are for demand to ease in the second half,
which is probably going to be reflected in lower imports and
domestic output in July,” said Wen Jinghai, an analyst at Bohai
Futures Co.  
 Three-month copper futures traded at $6,640 a ton at 2:48
p.m. in Singapore, 26 percent higher than 12 months ago. The
metal had the biggest annual increase in more than two decades
last year as China boosted imports to a record on $586 billion
of stimulus spending and state stockpiling.
