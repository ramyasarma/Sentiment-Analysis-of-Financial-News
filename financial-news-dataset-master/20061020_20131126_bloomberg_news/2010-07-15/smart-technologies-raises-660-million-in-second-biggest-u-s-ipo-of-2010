             Smart Technologies Inc. , which has
produced interactive whiteboards used in classrooms for almost
two decades, raised $660 million in the second-biggest initial
public offering in the U.S. this year.  
 The Calgary-based company priced 38.8 million Class A
shares at $17 each yesterday after offering 35.3 million for $16
to $18, according to a statement and a Securities and Exchange
Commission  filing . Smart Technologies will receive 23 percent of
proceeds. Selling shareholders including  Intel Corp.  and Apax
Partners will get the rest, reaping a more than sixfold gain on
average, the statement and filing show.  
 Smart Technologies’ initial sale, the biggest by a Canadian
technology company in at least a decade, comes as companies from
3-D film projector maker  RealD Inc.  to  Qlik Technologies Inc. 
seek to raise more than $1 billion combined this week. U.S. IPO
filings climbed to the highest since 2007 last quarter even as
deals worldwide were canceled at the fastest rate since the
collapse of New York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., while
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 6.4 percent this month.  
 “You’ve seen the risk appetite of the market increasing
and that’s certainly good for the IPO marketplace,” said  Joseph Garner , who helps oversee $2 billion as director of research at
Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based Emerald Asset Management Inc.
“The tech sector has been one of the stronger areas of the
market. It should be a favorable backdrop for IPOs.”  
 Nasdaq, Toronto Bourse  
 Smart Technologies advanced  0.3 percent  to $17.05 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading in New York. The stock was also listed on
the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company will use proceeds to pay
debt and for acquisitions, the filing showed.  
 Morgan Stanley  of New York, Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank
AG, and Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto led the offering.  
 At the midpoint price of $17, Smart’s enterprise value, or
the sum of its stock and debt minus cash, was about 18.4 times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
compared with about 16.2 times for Blackburn, England-based
 Promethean World Plc , according to London-based researcher
Independent International Investment Research Plc.  
 Growth Prospects  
 Promethean , the U.K. maker of electronic whiteboards
chaired by Orange co-founder  Graham Howe , has retreated 16
percent since raising 185.75 million pounds ($284 million) in a
March IPO.  
 Smart Technologies  reported net income of $142 million in
the fiscal year ended in March after sales increased 38 percent,
its filing showed. The company had posted losses in the previous
two years.  
 “Nothing has been easy in business, and we don’t expect
much of an easy ride, but we have gotten larger,”  Nancy Knowlton , president and chief executive officer of Smart
Technologies, said in an interview at the Nasdaq. “We’ve added
to the growth prospects of the business.”  
 Smart Technologies’ IPO increased in size as Santa Clara,
California-based  Intel , the world’s largest semiconductor maker,
and leveraged buyout firm Apax sold 3.53 million more shares
than they had originally intended. Existing owners in the $17-
per-share offering bought shares at an average price of $2.69
each, according to the company’s filing.  
 RealD, KKR  
 The initial sale was the biggest in the U.S. since  Oasis
Petroleum Inc.  of Houston raised $676 million in June. Smart
Technologies,  RealD  and 88 other companies filed with the SEC
last quarter to sell about $23 billion of shares, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  
 RealD, the Beverly Hills, California-based company whose 3-
D film projectors and glasses were used to show  James Cameron’s 
“Avatar,” plans to sell 10.75 million shares for $13 to $15
today, according to SEC filings and Bloomberg data.  
 KKR & Co., the New York-based leveraged buyout firm founded
by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , started trading on the New
York Stock Exchange today, falling  2.9 percent  to $10.20 from
the last closing price of $10.50 for its shares traded in
Amsterdam, which were delisted.  
 The private equity firm said on July 6 that it may sell
additional shares following the New York listing “subject to
market conditions.”
