             Jurors in a trial involving a
terrorist plot to destroy John F. Kennedy International Airport
in New York saw three photos today of defendant Abdul Kadir
posing with several firearms, after the judge overruled
objections from his lawyers about introducing them as evidence.  
 Government lawyers said Kadir, a former member of the
Parliament of Guyana, was on his way to Iran to pitch the plan
when he was arrested with the photos.
