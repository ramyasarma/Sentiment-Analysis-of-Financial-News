             Fairfield Energy Plc , a North Sea
oil and gas company, postponed its initial public offering in
London seeking as much as 330 million pounds ($500 million).  
 Staines, England-based Fairfield, partly owned by
private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, decided to delay its
stock sale “in the light of market conditions,” the company
said in a statement today. That’s the first postponed London IPO
since Ferrous Resources Ltd. shelved its $400 million IPO on
June 2.  
 While 14 companies in western Europe postponed or shelved
their plans to sell a combined $8.3 billion of initial shares
this year, European firms such as Ocado Group Plc are preparing
the most IPOs in two years after newly listed companies
weathered the region’s debt crisis and outperformed U.S. deals,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Fairfield was set up in 2005 with funds from private-equity
firms led by New York-based Warburg Pincus, manager of a $15
billion buyout fund, according to the company’s website.  
 Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Hawkpoint Partners Ltd. were managers of the IPO, along with BNP
Paribas SA, Oriel Securities and RBC Capital Markets.
