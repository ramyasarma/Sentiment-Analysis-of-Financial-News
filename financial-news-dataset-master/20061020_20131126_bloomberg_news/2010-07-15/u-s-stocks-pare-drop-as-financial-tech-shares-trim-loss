             U.S. stocks pared declines as
financial and technology companies recovered from their weakest
levels of the day and gauges of utilities and consumer staples
companies turned higher.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent to
1,090.02 at 1:28 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average slipped 0.5 percent to 10,313.14, dropping for the first
time in eight sessions.  
 The S&P 500 lost as much as 1.3 percent in morning trading
after reports from the Federal Reserve showed manufacturing
growth in the New York and Philadelphia regions that trailed
economists’ estimates, overshadowing better-than-projected
profit at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
