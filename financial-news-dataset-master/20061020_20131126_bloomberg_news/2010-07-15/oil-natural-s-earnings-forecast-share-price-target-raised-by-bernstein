             Oil & Natural Gas Corp. ’s share
price and earnings estimates were raised by Sanford C. Bernstein
& Co. after domestic natural gas prices were increased and some
fuels deregulated.  
 Bernstein increased the 2011-2012 earnings estimates of
India’s biggest explorer by 10 percent and raised the share
price target to 1,400 rupees from an earlier forecast of 1,340
rupees, according to a report today.  
 The  company’s  stock price has increased 6.8 percent this
year in Mumbai trading to 1,258.50 rupees.  
 “Pricing reform and strong production growth will
significantly improve earnings in the coming years,” analysts
 Neil Beveridge  and  Angus Chan  said in the report. “Further
upside in the stock can come from further reform of diesel
prices which we think is likely and high impact deep water
exploration off India’s east coast.”  
 A compounded annual production growth rate of 3 percent
coupled with improved oil and gas revenue from recent policy
changes will drive Oil & Natural Gas’s cash flow per share
higher by 14 percent on an average, compounded annually, over
the next three years, Bernstein said.
