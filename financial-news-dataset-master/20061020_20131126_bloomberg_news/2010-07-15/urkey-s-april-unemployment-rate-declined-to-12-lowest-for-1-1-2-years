             Turkey’s  jobless rate  fell to 12
percent in the three months through May, the lowest for a year
and a half.  
 The rate declined from 14.9 percent a year ago and 12.5
percent in the previous month, the statistics office in Ankara
said on its website today.  
 The jobless rate was 10.7 percent in September 2008, when
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Inc. prompted a global crisis
that led to a 4.7 percent slump in Turkey’s  gross domestic
product  last year. While the labor market is improving, jobless
levels remain high, the central bank said on June 17 when it
left rates unchanged at 7 percent.  
 “Labor market conditions continue improving swiftly and
this should support domestic demand,”  Yarkin Cebeci , an
economist for JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Istanbul, said in an e-
mailed report. “The slack is still substantial and we do not
see any wage pressures in the near term.”  
 The economy added 1.1 million jobs in services,
construction and manufacturing compared with a year earlier, the
statistics office said today. Agricultural jobs rose by 660,000.
About 22.5 million people were employed in the period, compared
with 20.7 million a year earlier.  
 The  jobless rate among those aged under 24  fell to 21.2
percent from 26.5 percent a year earlier.  
 The workforce participation rate, a measure of how many
people of working age have jobs or are seeking employment, rose
to 48.8 percent from 47.2 percent a year earlier, the statistics
agency said.
