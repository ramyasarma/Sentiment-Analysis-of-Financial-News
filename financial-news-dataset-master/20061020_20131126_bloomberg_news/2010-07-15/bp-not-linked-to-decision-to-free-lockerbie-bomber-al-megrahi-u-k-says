             U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron’s
office said there was no link between the Scottish government’s
decision to free jailed Libyan Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-
Megrahi and activities undertaken by BP Plc in Libya.  
 There is “no link between the Scottish executive’s
decision to release Megrahi” and BP, Cameron’s spokesman Steve
Field told reporters in London today.
