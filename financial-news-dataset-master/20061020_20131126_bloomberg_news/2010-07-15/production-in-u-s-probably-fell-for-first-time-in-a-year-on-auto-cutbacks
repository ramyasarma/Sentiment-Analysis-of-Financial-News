             Industrial production in the U.S.
fell in June for the first time in a year, a sign manufacturing
is easing to a more sustainable pace of growth, economists said
ahead of a Federal Reserve report today.  
 A 0.1 percent decline, the median projection in a Bloomberg
News survey of 76 economists, would follow a 1.3 percent jump in
May that was the biggest in 10 months. Other reports may show
decreases in claims for jobless benefits and wholesale prices.  
 Factories, which led the economy out of the worst recession
since the 1930s, are facing less pressure to boost production to
rebuild  inventories  as consumer spending cools. A pickup in
business spending to update equipment, which has spurred sales
and earnings at companies such as  Intel Corp. , will instead
propel manufacturing in coming months.  
 “Sure we’ve lost some momentum in manufacturing over of
the last month or two, but in general things continue to grow,
just not quite as fast as they had,” said Russell  Price , a
senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Inc. in Detroit.  
 The Fed’s production report is due at 9:15 a.m. in
Washington. Survey estimates ranged from a drop of 0.8 percent
to an increase of 0.8 percent.  
 Economists forecast  capacity  utilization, a measure of how
much of a plant is in use, held at 74.1 percent, according to
the survey median. The gauge averaged 80 over the past 20 years
and suggests inflation remains low.  
 Producer Prices  
 The Labor Department may report at 8:30 a.m. that prices
paid to producers fell in June for a third month, the longest
such stretch since the end of 2008. The producer price index
dropped 0.1 percent last month after a 0.3 percent decrease in
May, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Regional manufacturing figures for July may show little
change from the prior month. The  New York Fed’s  general economic
index, known as the Empire State manufacturing survey and
scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m., dropped to 18 from a June
reading of 19.6, according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 The  Philadelphia Fed ’s survey at 10 a.m. will show a gain
to 10 this month from 8, according to the median forecast. For
both measures, results greater than zero represent expansion.  
 The Labor Department’s figures on  initial jobless claims  at
8:30 a.m. will show filings fell to 445,000 last week, according
to the median in a Bloomberg survey. The projected level
indicates improvement in the labor market will take time to
materialize.  
 Auto Production  
 The Fed’s production report may show a decrease in motor
vehicles and parts output. Economists at JPMorgan are
forecasting a 4.4 percent decrease in auto production. Excluding
vehicles, manufacturing probably dropped 0.7 percent, they said.  
 While limited job creation has restrained consumer
spending, manufacturers are benefitting from corporate
investment in new equipment. Manufacturing shares have also
outperformed the market. The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite
Industrial Machinery Index of 52 companies has increased 8.2
percent this year compared with a 1.8 percent decline in the
broader S&P 500.  
 “Capacity still needs to be increased in order to meet
demand,”  Richard Hill , chief executive officer of  Novellus
Systems Inc. , said in an interview July 13. “There’s a major
overhaul of PCs throughout the corporate world.”  
 Novellus, which makes semiconductor equipment, said July 12
that bookings rose 20 percent in the second quarter compared
with a year earlier and shipments increased 17 percent.  
 Customers are “reasonably confident that the economy is
going to rebound,” Hill said.  
 Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, said on July 13 that
sales will be $11.6 billion this quarter, plus or minus $400
million. Analysts estimated $10.9 billion on average, according
to a Bloomberg survey.  
 Companies have resumed spending on PCs and servers, fueling
demand for chips, said Chief Financial Officer  Stacy Smith . “We
saw a resurgence of the enterprise market,” Smith said in an
interview. “We see inventory levels that are healthy.”
