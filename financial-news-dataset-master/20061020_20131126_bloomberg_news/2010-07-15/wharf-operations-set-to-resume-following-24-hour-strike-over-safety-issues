             A strike at POAGS, an Australian
port operator, ended today as waterfront union workers returned
to work following a 24-hour shutdown sparked by safety concerns.  
 Work resumed at 15 of the company’s ports nationwide from
the 3 p.m. shift today with no plans to extend the disruption
while the union is in talks with the company on ways to improve
safety,  Maritime Union of Australia  spokesman Michael Meagher
said by telephone today. Workers walked out after a 41-year-old
man was crushed to death yesterday at Melbourne’s Appleton Dock.  
 Workers at the 15 ports yesterday delayed the loading of
ships to protest the third death of a worker this year and
called for increased government regulation, the union said. The
worker, whose identity wasn’t disclosed, was crushed when a 2.5
metric ton steel beam fell from a crane.  
 POAGS, formerly known as P&O Automotive and General
Stevedoring, is owned by a group including Kaplan Funds
Management and  Qube Logistics , which acquired control of the
business from Dubai’s DP World Ltd. in 2007.  
 “POAGS has a safety management system that is consistent
with national industry standards and complies with all
requirements of relevant workplace safety,” the company said in
an e-mailed statement. “Authorities are still investigating the
cause of the accident and we will work closely with them to
understand why it occurred.”  
 The business is chaired by  Chris Corrigan , the former chief
executive officer of Patrick Corp., which is now part of rival
port operator Asciano Ltd.
