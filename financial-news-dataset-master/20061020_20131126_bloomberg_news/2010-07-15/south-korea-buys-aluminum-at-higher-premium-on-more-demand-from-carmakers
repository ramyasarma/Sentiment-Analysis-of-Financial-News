               South Korea ,  Asia ’s third-biggest
buyer of base metals, bought 2,000 metric tons of aluminum at a
higher premium than last month as demand for the metal advanced
on increased car output.  
 The Public Procurement Service, a state body that manages
strategic commodities, paid Glencore International AG $115 a ton
more than the London Metal Exchange official cash settlement
price, Hwang Young Soo, a senior analyst at the agency, said in
an e-mail late yesterday. The high-grade primary aluminum of
non-Western origin is due for shipment by the end of August.  
 The latest premium is greater than the $108 a ton paid over
the same benchmark in the last such tender on June 24 as the
nation’s car industry and other manufacturing industries remain
“robust,” Hwang wrote in the e-mail.  
   Hyundai Motor Co . and  Kia Motors Corp ., South Korea’s
largest automakers, led a 12th straight gain in monthly sales in
June. South Korea’s central bank on July 12 raised its economic
growth forecast for this year to 5.9 percent, more than the 5.2
percent predicted in April.
