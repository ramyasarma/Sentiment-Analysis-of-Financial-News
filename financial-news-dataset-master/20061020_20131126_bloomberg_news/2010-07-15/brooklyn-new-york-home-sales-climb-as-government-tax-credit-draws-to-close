             Home prices in Brooklyn, New York,
climbed 5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier as
buyers made deals before a federal tax credit expired.  
 The median price of condominiums, co-operative apartments
and townhouses in New York City’s most-populous borough rose to
$463,000, appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and broker Prudential
Douglas Elliman Real Estate said in a report today. Luxury
prices, defined as the top 10 percent of sales, gained 16
percent to $1.14 million.  
 The nationwide housing slump, which hit Brooklyn and
Manhattan later than the rest of the U.S., began improving as
buyers found bargains and sought contracts before April 30, the
deadline to capture a federal tax credit of as much as $8,000.
The  median price  of an existing U.S. home rose to $179,600 in
May after falling to 164,600 in February. Manhattan’s median
apartment price jumped 7.6 percent to $899,000 in the three
months ended June 30.  
 “We’ve come from a very dire market a year ago to more of
a sense of normalcy,”  Miller Samuel  President  Jonathan Miller 
said in a telephone interview. “I don’t think anyone
anticipated that the return would be so quick.”  
 Sales of condos, co-ops, townhouses and single-family
residences increased 16 percent from a year earlier to 1,660. It
took property owners an average 103 days to sell, down from 146.  
 Brownstone Neighborhoods  
 In Brooklyn neighborhoods dominated by brownstones --
including Cobble Hill and Park Slope -- sales almost doubled to
84 homes and the median price gained 12 percent to $1.1 million.
The average price per square foot for those buildings rose 13
percent to $462.  
 In Queens, the city’s second-biggest borough by number of
residents, sales soared 87 percent to 3,972 homes, according to
Miller Samuel and Prudential Douglas Elliman. The median sales
price fell 7.5 percent to $335,000.  
 Unemployment  and tight credit are challenging a real estate
recovery, Miller said. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 9.5
percent in June after touching a 26-year-high of 10.1 percent in
October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The New
York City jobless rate was a seasonally adjusted 9.6 percent in
May, down from a 17-year-high of 10.6 percent in December.  
 “The market remains in a delicate state, and we’re seeing
negative numbers for unemployment,” Michael Guerra, vice
president and Brooklyn sales director for  Elliman , said in a
telephone interview. “But it doesn’t take away the fact that
buyers are more confident now.”  
 Sales could slow again since the federal home-buying tax
credit disappeared, Miller said.  
 Gary Parker, director of government and community affairs
for  New York University , used the credit to buy “gorgeous views
of the Verrazano bridge and sunsets” from his $277,500 one-
bedroom co-op in Brooklyn’s Kensington Park neighborhood.  
 “It was just the right time, the right place, the right
deal,” said Parker, 42. “I walked in and thought ‘this is
home.’”
