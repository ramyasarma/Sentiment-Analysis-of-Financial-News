             Mexican infrastructure trust funds
may raise as much as 100 billion pesos ($7.8 billion) from
pension funds as an alternative to debt and equity sales, said
 Pedro Ordorica , president of regulator Consar.  
 The 15 government-regulated pension funds have invested 16
billion pesos in the trusts, including a highway project owned
by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Empresas ICA SAB, Mexico’s
largest construction company,  Ordorica  said in an interview at
Bloomberg’s Mexico City office today.  
 “The rules now allow funds to invest in almost all equity
and bond classes,” said Ordorica, 50. “There is a potential
100 billion pesos available to invest in these funds.”  
 Mexico’s pension funds managed about 1.28 trillion pesos in
June, Consar said today on its website.
