             Banco do Brasil SA, Latin America’s
largest bank by assets, was raised to “buy” at Deutsche Bank
AG, which said the stock is trading at an attractive valuation
following its “successful” share sale.  
 Banco do Brasil has climbed 15 percent in the two weeks
since the company and its shareholders said they’re raising 9.76
billion reais ($5.5 billion) in Brazil’s biggest stock sale in
eight months.
