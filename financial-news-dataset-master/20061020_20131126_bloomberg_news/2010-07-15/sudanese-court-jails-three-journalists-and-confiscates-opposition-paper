             A Sudanese court handed down prison
sentences to three journalists and ordered the confiscation of
their newspaper after convicting them of spreading hatred and
undermining the constitution, their lawyer said.  
 Aba Zer Ali al-Amin, the author of an article questioning
the popularity of President  Umar al-Bashir , was sentenced to 5
years in prison, while two editors were given 2 years, lawyer
Abdel Monein Othman Idriss, told reporters today in Khartoum,
the capital. The Raay al-Shaab newspaper is aligned with the
opposition Popular Congress Party, whose leader,  Hassan al- Turabi , was released on June 30 after more than a month in jail.  
 “They did not raise a weapon, they raised a pen to express
their opinions,” Idriss said. One editor was acquitted.  
 Bashir and his National Congress Party won presidential and
national elections in April that most opposition parties
boycotted. Bashir, 66, who came to power in a 1989 coup, has
been charged by the  International Criminal Court  with
responsibility for war crimes and genocide in the western region
of Darfur.  
 The U.S., the U.K. and Norway this month criticized the
authorities in Khartoum for allegedly cracking down on the
opposition since the elections.  
 “We are deeply concerned at the actions of the
Sudanese authorities since the election, which have further
undermined civil and political rights, including the arrest of
opposition politicians, journalists and peaceful protestors,”
the three countries said in a joint statement July 9.
