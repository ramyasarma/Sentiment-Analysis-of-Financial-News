             Sanofi-Aventis SA ’s heart drug
Multaq won the final draft recommendation of the U.K.’s National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, reaffirming a
March decision supporting the limited use of the drug by the
National Health Service.  
 Multaq, used in the treatment of irregular heartbeats, was
less effective than competing medication, though it had fewer
side effects and a lower risk of early death, the agency, known
as  NICE , said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The agency advises the state-run National Health Service on
the cost-effectiveness of medicines. Multaq, also called
dronedarone, would cost 2.25 pounds ($3.46) a day compared with
the generic drug amiodarone, which costs 5 pence, NICE said.
Multaq should be considered “as a treatment option only in
people who have additional cardiovascular risk factors such as
diabetes or high blood pressure,” said Andrew Dillon, NICE’s
chief executive officer, in the statement.  
 Atrial fibrillation effects 46,000 people in the U.K. every
year, according to NICE. Multaq was introduced as a safer
alternative to amiodarone, which is associated with major liver
and lung risks. Multaq has suffered several setbacks since 2003,
when Sanofi halted clinical trials because more patients given
the drug died than those taking placebo. Multaq was given Food
and Drug Administration approval in the U.S. in July 2009, after
an initial rejection in 2006.  
 The NICE recommendation will go through a consultation
process before final guidance is issued to the NHS, which NICE
expects to do in August.
