             Ferrovial SA gained the most in more
than two months in Madrid trading after Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board offered A$3.47 billion ($3.05 billion) for
toll-road operator  Intoll Group .  
 The shares  rose  9.7 percent to close at 6.50 euros, the
biggest advance since May 10. Intoll assets include a 30 percent
stake in Ferrovial’s 407 ETR highway in Toronto. Ferrovial has
put up for sale a 10 percent stake in the highway.  
 “The bid proves that the market was undervaluing
Ferrovial’s stake in 407,” said  Francisco Salvador , co-
strategist at Iberian Equities in Madrid. “It also shows that
there is clear demand for the asset.”  
 The bid gives an indicative value of about 700 million
euros ($903 million) for a 10 percent stake, Salvador estimated.  
 Ferrovial’s Cintra division owns 53 percent of the 407 toll
road. The Madrid-based company aims to complete the sale of 10
percent this year, Chief Executive Officer Inigo Meiras said
last month.
