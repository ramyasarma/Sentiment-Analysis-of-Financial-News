             Stocks in Switzerland declined,
halting the longest winning streak since February for the Swiss
Market Index, after U.S. reports reignited concern about the
strength of the global economic recovery.  
 Shares from Transocean Ltd., the company that leased the
Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico to BP Plc, to
Holcim Ltd. fell in Zurich trading. SGS SA dropped 3 percent
after the world’s biggest goods inspector reported profit that
missed analysts’ projections.  
 The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  dropped 41.21, or 0.7
percent, to 6,291.07 in Zurich, snapping seven days of gains.
The broader  Swiss Performance Index  slid 0.6 percent. The gauges
earlier rallied after JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported earnings
that beat analysts’ estimates.  
 “Investor concerns over economic growth took the shine off
better-than-expected earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co.,” said
London-based  Giles Watts , head of equities at City Index.
“Unfortunately the poor economic data theme has returned to the
fore today.”  
 A report today showed manufacturing in the New York region
expanded in July at the slowest pace this year, trailing
economists’ estimates. The market extended losses after the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index
unexpectedly declined.  
 Soured Mortgages  
 JPMorgan , the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
profit rose 76 percent, buoyed by a $6.3 billion reduction in
provisions for soured mortgages and credit-card loans from last
year. JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to post
second-quarter results.  
 Transocean dropped 2.8 percent to 54.7 francs.  Holcim , the
world’s second-largest cement maker, fell 1.7 percent to 69.95
francs. Credit Suisse Group AG fell 2.6 percent to 44.24 francs.  
 SGS dropped 3 percent to 1,538 francs after the company
reported first-half net income of 270 million Swiss francs
($257.8 million). That missed analysts’ median estimate of 275
million francs, according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 Schulthess Group AG  also retreated after the manufacturer
reported a 14 percent decline in first-half sales to 139.6
million francs. The stock tumbled 3.7 percent to 34 francs.
