             KKR & Co. , whose shares will start
trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, is seeking to
raise $800 million to invest in China, Asia’s biggest private-
equity market, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  
 The KKR China Fund will focus on growth-capital investments,
the people said, asking not to be identified because the
information is private.  Richard Barton , a Hong Kong-based
spokesman at KKR’s public relations firm Kreab Gavin Anderson,
declined to comment.  
 New York-based KKR joins Blackstone Group LP and Carlyle
Group, the world’s biggest private-equity firms, in targeting
investments in China as the country’s economic growth has
outpaced the rest of the world. China-focused funds accounted
for about 70 percent of the private-equity capital raised in
Asia in the first half of the year, said  Kathleen Ng , managing
director at the Center for Asia Private Equity Research Ltd. in
Hong Kong.  
 “China is such a central part of the overall private
equity market,” Ng said today. “It’s a natural development for
all the global firms that need to come into the Asia market.”  
 KKR, founded by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, set up in
2007 an Asian fund that focuses on buyouts in Greater China,
Japan and Australia, according to its  website .  
 China attracted $10.5 billion of private-equity capital in
the first half of this year, accounting for 68 percent of the
$15.4 billion raised in Asia in the period, according to the
Centre for Asia Private Equity Research. It is almost four times
the $2.8 billion raised for China-focused private-equity funds
in the first half of last year, according the firm.  
 Carlyle’s Plan  
 New York-based Blackstone was the first global private-
equity firm to set up a 5 billion yuan ($738 million) fund with
the Shanghai government in August to target investments in the
eastern coastal city and neighboring areas.  
 Washington-based Carlyle, the world’s second-biggest
private-equity firm, announced in February a yuan-denominated
fund with Fosun Group, a Chinese privately owned company whose
businesses span steel, mining and property. Carlyle is also
planning a domestic Chinese private-equity fund with the Beijing
government.  
 China’s  economic growth  eased to 11.1 percent in the first
half after the government succeeded in tempering credit
expansion, investment spending and property speculation.  
 KKR is moving its listing to the more liquid New York Stock
Exchange from Amsterdam. KKR initially filed to sell shares
weeks before the global credit crisis crippled equity and debt
markets in 2007. It scrapped that plan, opting to merge with its
publicly traded European fund, a combination that was completed
last year.  
 A U.S. listing clears the way for KKR to issue additional
stock and enables firm insiders to eventually cash out their
stakes if they so choose.

the fund.
