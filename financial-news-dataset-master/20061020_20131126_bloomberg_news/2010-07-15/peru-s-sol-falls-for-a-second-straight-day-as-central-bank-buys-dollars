             Peru’s sol fell for a second day
after the central bank bought dollars and raised the limit on
pension fund investments overseas to offset rising demand for
the local currency.  
 The sol slid 0.1 percent to 2.8225 per U.S. dollar at 4:45
p.m. New York time, from 2.8210 yesterday. The currency has
declined 0.2 percent since July 13.  
 Three increases in the central bank’s benchmark lending
rate since May have spurred demand for the local currency. The
sol climbed to a 23-month high on July 13, prompting the bank to
purchase a record $493.5 million yesterday to temper the
currency’s rise. The bank bought a further $151 million today at
an average 2.8218 soles per dollar, causing the sol to weaken,
said  Frank Babarczy , head of trading at BBVA Banco Continental.  
 “There were sales of dollars, although fewer than
yesterday,” Babarczy said.  
 Policy makers raised the limit on how much the country’s
private pension funds can invest abroad to 28 percent of their
assets from 26 percent, easing pressure on the exchange rate,
the central bank said today. The increase will allow the funds
to invest an additional $500 million overseas, the bank said.  
 “The trend is for the sol to continue gaining this year on
the trade surplus and investment capital inflows,”  Gonzalo Camargo , investment manager at pension fund AFP Horizonte, told
reporters in Lima.  
 Peru’s economy expanded faster than expected in May as a
recovery in private investment fuels demand.  Output  surged 9.2
percent from the same month a year earlier, the second-fastest
pace in 19 months, the National Statistics Institute said today.
Economists had forecast 9 percent growth for May, according to
the median estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The central bank is buying dollars to halt “volatile”
exchange rate swings, Camargo said.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 5.53 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s local
unit. That’s the biggest rise in six weeks.
