             Cricket South Africa expects to
attract the biggest-ever crowd at a cricket match in the country
by hosting a 20-20 match between India and South Africa at a
stadium in the city of Durban built for the soccer World Cup.  
 The match will take place on Jan. 9, Michael Owen-Smith, a
spokesman for Cricket South Africa, said in an interview from
his mobile phone today.  
 Durban’s Moses Mabhida stadium has the capacity to seat
more than 60,000 people while the highest capacity at existing
cricket grounds in South Africa is 30,000, he said.
