             The cost of insuring against losses
on Spain’s debt fell after a government bond sale drew increased
demand, adding to evidence Europe’s sovereign debt crisis is
easing.  
 Credit-default swaps on Spain fell 2 basis points to 214,
reversing an earlier increase, according to data provider CMA.
Corporate credit indexes were little changed.  
 Spain sold the full 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) of 15-
year bonds planned, attracting bids for 2.57 times the
securities on offer compared with 1.79 at the last auction in
April. Italy, Portugal and Greece also raised funds this week
after the European Union and International Monetary Fund in May
approved a backstop to bolster confidence in the region’s most
indebted nations.  
 Strong demand at the Spanish auction was “in line with
earlier auctions in peripheral sovereigns,” said  Maureen Schuller , a strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. “It’s
definitely an important signal peripheral sovereigns can fund
themselves and do not need to draw on rescue funds for their
funding.”  
 Swaps on Italy dropped 5 basis points to 174, Greece
declined 7 to 798.5 and Portugal fell 1 to 285, CMA prices show.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 5.5
basis points to 513.5 after earlier climbing as high as 526,
according to Markit Group Ltd.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings pared an advance and was little changed
at 113.5 basis points.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($12.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of credit quality.
