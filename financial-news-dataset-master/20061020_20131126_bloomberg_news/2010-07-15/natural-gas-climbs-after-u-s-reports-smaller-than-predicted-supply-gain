             Natural gas futures rose the most in
more than six months after a government report showed a smaller-
than-forecast inventory increase as hotter-than-normal weather
boosted demand for the power-plant fuel.  
 Gas stockpiles gained 78 billion cubic feet in the week
ended July 9 to 2.84 trillion, the Energy Department said today.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected an increase of 80
billion. A surplus to the five-year average narrowed to 10.7
percent from 11.5 percent the previous week.  
 “The market has been trying to go down in the past few
weeks despite this supportive storage trend, and now we seem to
be waking up,” said  Tim Evans , an analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “Forecasts for warmer-than-normal
temperatures suggest more supportive storage results in the
weeks ahead.”  
 Natural gas for August delivery rose 28 cents, or 6.5
percent, to settle at $4.586 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest one-day
increase since Jan. 6. Gas was trading at $4.29 before the
storage report was released at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.  
 Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
368,305 as of 2:45 p.m., the highest level compared with total
trading since June 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The three-month average combined volume for electronic trading
and transactions on the floor of the exchange is 251,000.  
 Average Gain  
 Last week’s storage increase was smaller than the five-year
average gain of 89 billion cubic feet, department data showed. A
deficit to year-earlier supplies widened to 1.1 percent from 0.8
percent the previous week.  
 Temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast will be
above normal through July 24, according to MDA Federal Inc.’s
EarthSat Energy Weather, based in Rockville, Maryland.  
 New York will have a high of 96 degrees Fahrenheit (36
Celsius) tomorrow, 10 degrees above average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. Boston’s temperature is forecast to hit 86.  
 New York saw 103 degrees Fahrenheit on July 6, a record for
the date, according to the National Weather Service.  
 About 22 percent of electricity is generated using natural
gas, Energy Department figures show.  
 Cooling requirements in the U.S. will be 32 percent higher
than normal from tomorrow through July 22, according to Weather
Derivatives of Belton, Missouri.  
 Gas inventories this year will “remain very near last
year’s levels” and stockpiles will reach 3.81 trillion cubic
feet by the end of October, the Energy Department said in its
monthly Short Term Energy Outlook last week. Supplies rose to a
record 3.837 trillion cubic feet on Nov. 27.  
 Inventory Record  
 “The real problem is if we still are looking into the
possibility of reaching record levels this year, and that’s
going to continue to weigh on prices,” said  Teri Viswanath , a
director of commodities research at Credit Suisse Securities USA
in Houston.  
 Gas declined 11 percent in the previous eight days amid
ample supplies.  
 U.S. gas production will average 61.26 billion cubic feet a
day this year, up 2.1 percent from 59.98 billion in 2009, the
Energy Department said last week.  
 The government “projects a continuing decline in Gulf of
Mexico production, which is offset by gains in onshore
production,” according to the department’s report last week.  
 This hurricane season, estimated by the government to be
the most active since 2005, may cut gas production in the Gulf
of Mexico by 166 billion cubic feet through November, according
to the Energy Department.  
 Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, gained 3.53 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $4.4278 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.
