             Around 600 British nationals are
rescued from drowning in Australia every year, the U.K.’s
 Foreign & Commonwealth Office  said today.  
 A total of 6,439 Britons were arrested overseas in the year
to March 31, according to the FCO’s British Behaviour Abroad
report, which has been released annually since 2007. 944 people
were arrested for drug offenses and 3,689 were hospitalized
while abroad.  
 Many of the 600 rescued from drowning in Australia were
found to have been drinking alcohol, according to the report,
which catalogs a wide range of incidents and offers advice on
how to avoid trouble.  
 The majority of hospitalizations of Britons in New Zealand
are the result of “drunken falls” the report said. Several
accidents in Egypt involved four-wheeled, all-terrain vehicles,
with one bikini-clad British girl unable to receive painkilling
treatment because of the high level of alcohol in her
bloodstream, according to the report.  
 A drunken British tourist was caught urinating on one of
Latvia’s most-revered monuments and “made an example of,”
according to the Foreign Office, with five days in custody.  
 Spain was the country where most Britons were arrested,
while, as a proportion of the number of visitors, British people
were most likely to be arrested in Thailand.  
 One in seven Britons arrested abroad are held over drug
allegations, according to the statistics.
