             Carlyle Group agreed to acquire  NBTY
Inc. , the maker of Nature’s Bounty, MET-Rx and Solgar
nutritional supplements, for $3.8 billion in the biggest
leveraged buyout this year.  
 NBTY rose $16.24, or 43 percent, to $53.71 by 2:45 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading after saying in a
statement that Carlyle offered to pay $55 a share in cash for
the Ronkonkoma, New York-based company. The offer is 47 percent
higher than yesterday’s closing price.  
 Carlyle beat rivals including Blackstone Group LP and TPG
to win the support of NBTY’s board, according to a person
involved in the deal who asked not to be identified. The
Washington-based firm has been the most active in buyouts this
year as the industry rushes to invest an estimated $507 billion
in capital committed by investors before the buyout market
collapsed in mid-2007.  
 “This transaction delivers exceptional value to our
shareholders,”  Scott Rudolph , NBTY’s chief executive officer,
said in the statement.  
 The deal would be Carlyle’s largest since its $6.3 billion
acquisition of nursing-home operator Manor Care Inc. in 2007,
and the biggest in the industry since TPG, based in Fort Worth,
Texas, and Canada’s CPP Investment Board agreed to buy software-
provider IMS Health Inc. for $5.2 billion in November.  
 Buyout Slump  
 The pace of LBOs is accelerating after the economy and
financial markets recovered. Buyouts have increased fivefold to
$38.2 billion since the start of the year, compared with $7.2
billion for the same time period last year. That is still a
fraction of the $207 billion in deals during the second quarter
of 2009, at the peak of the buyout boom.  
 Transactions are also smaller, in part because banks are
lending less and demanding larger equity commitments. The
average deal size so far this year is $357 million, compared
with $826 million in 2007. Only 15 of the 360 deals announced
this year were valued at $1 billion or more.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital and Credit
Suisse are providing $2.4 billion in debt for the NBTY takeover,
according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the information is private.  
 Carlyle is backing the deal with about $1.4 billion in
equity, or 37 percent of the transaction value, which will be
funded by its Carlyle Partners V fund. The Carlyle fund may
split some of that amount with co-investors, the person said.  
 Blackstone, TPG  
 The other buyout firms vying for the company, including TPG
and Blackstone Group LP, were seeking a partner to provide the
equity capital for their offers, according to the person.  
 Bank of America and Centerview Partners LLC are financial
advisers to NBTY. Barclays Capital and Credit Suisse are
advising Carlyle.  
 Carlyle is leading leveraged buyouts this year with 15
announced deals valued at $4.4 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “We are impressed with the business that has been built
under the leadership of Scott Rudolph, and are excited to work
with him and the senior management team to drive continued
growth,”  Sandra Horbach , Carlyle’s head of the consumer and
retail team, said in the statement.  
 NBTY may solicit other bids during a 35-day period, the
company said in the statement. The company lost a fifth of its
value on April 27 after reporting earnings that fell short of
analysts’ estimates. The  stock  was down 14 percent this year
through yesterday.  
 S&P Watch  
 Under the terms of the Carlyle offer, shareholders will get
about $3.54 billion in cash, based on 64.3 million outstanding
NBTY shares at the end of March. The company had $226 million in
net debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Standard & Poor’s analyst Jacqueline Hui said she may lower
NBTY’s BB corporate credit rating if the transaction leads to a
“material” deterioration in the company’s credit measures.  
 NBTY’s board has unanimously approved the takeover and
recommended the offer to shareholders. The purchase is scheduled
to be completed by the end of 2010.
