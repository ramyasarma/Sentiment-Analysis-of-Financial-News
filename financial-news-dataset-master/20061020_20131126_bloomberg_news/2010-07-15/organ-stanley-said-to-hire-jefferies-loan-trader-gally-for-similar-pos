             Morgan Stanley, the world’s second-
biggest merger adviser, hired Jefferies Group Inc. par loan

familiar with the move.  
 Gally, 32, joined Jefferies & Co., a Jefferies unit, last
year after almost nine years at  Deutsche Bank AG , said the
people, who declined to be identified because the move hasn’t

couldn’t immediately comment.  Tom Tarrant , a Jefferies
spokesman, declined to comment. Gally declined to be
interviewed.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is the biggest merger adviser.
