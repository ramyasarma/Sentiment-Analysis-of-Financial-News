             Ronald Reagan Washington National
Airport lost power at two terminals, shutting down ticket
counters and concession stands, a spokesman said.  
 The electricity went out at terminals B and C at about
11:45 a.m. local time, said Neal Phillips, a spokesman for the
Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority. It’s not clear when
power will be restored, he said.  
 Passengers should contact their airlines for information on
delays or cancelations, Phillips said by telephone, adding that
he can’t comment on which flights may be affected.  
 US Airways Group Inc. is holding back one shuttle flight to
New York’s LaGuardia airport and another to Boston,  Valerie Wunder , a spokeswoman for the company, said by telephone.  
 While the airline has not yet canceled any flights, it may
have to later today, she said.
