             Crude steel production  in China, the
world’s biggest maker of the metal, fell to a four-month low as
companies shut plants for maintenance amid weakening demand
from builders and automakers.  
 Output was 53.8 million metric tons in June, the lowest
level since February, according to data from the National Bureau
of Statistics. That’s 4.1 percent lower than the 56.1 million
tons in May, and 9 percent higher than a year ago.  
 China’s larger steelmakers, including  Wuhan Iron & Steel
Group  and  Hebei Iron & Steel Group , are joining smaller rivals
in reducing production after prices fell 17 percent from an 18
month-high on April 15. Steel prices are likely to drop 10
percent for the rest of the year because of high inventory and
poor demand, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a July 12 note.  
 “National daily production has shrunk 10 percent from the
peak, but it is still 12 percent to 18 percent higher than in
the first quarter of 2009, the last time losses were industry-
wide,” Citigroup Inc. analyst  Scarlett Chen  wrote in a July 14
note. “Big mills will have to cut more production than small
mills.”  
 China, the biggest buyer of iron ore, will probably cut
annual imports of the raw material for the first time since 1998
because of slowing demand from the steelmakers, according to  Xu Xiangchun , chief analyst of Mysteel Research Institute. Iron ore
imports surged 42 percent last year to 628 million tons.
