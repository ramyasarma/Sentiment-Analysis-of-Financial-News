             Intensive rain and increased
discharge from the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric damn in central
Mozambique has resulted in crop losses along the Zambezi river
valley, state-controlled Noticias reported, citing Adelina
Randinho, an administrative officer for the Caia district.  
 She didn’t provide figures for the amount of crops lost,
Noticias said. Randinho said the rains along the valley are
worsening, according to the report.
