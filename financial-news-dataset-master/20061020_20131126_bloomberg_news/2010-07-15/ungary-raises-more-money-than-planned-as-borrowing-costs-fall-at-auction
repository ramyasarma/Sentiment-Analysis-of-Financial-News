             Hungary raised more than its target
in a debt auction as borrowing costs declined, after falling
short of sales goals three times since the start of June.  
 The state debt management agency sold 55 billion forint
($252 million) of bonds, more than the 50 billion forint
planned, according to data on the debt management agency’s
Bloomberg page. Bids totaled 132 billion forint, it said. The
extra amount came from the sale of 2020 bonds, which the
government increased by 5 billion forint from 10 billion forint.  
 Investors are focused on talks between the government and
the  International Monetary Fund  about the country’s progress in
meeting the terms of a bailout loan agreement, according to
 Peter Bratincsak , who manages about 250 billion forint of
Hungarian debt at Allianz Hungaria in Budapest. Today’s auction
result may be a bet that negotiations will succeed, he said.  
 “I was surprised by the amount of demand,” Bratincsak
said. “I doubt this is happening based on fundamentals. This is
probably a short-term trade.”  
 The forint traded down 0.4 percent at 279.65 per euro at
12:49 p.m. in Budapest. It has lost 5.9 percent against the euro
in the past three months, the worst performance among more than
170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 IMF Negotiations  
 The forint will underperform the Polish zloty as risk
increases that the IMF negotiations will fail, according to
Societe Generale SA, which said it sold the currency against the
euro this morning as it sees “little downside” for the euro-
forint.  
 Hungary, which had to resort to an IMF-led bailout in 2008
to avert a default, is seeking a new, “precautionary” IMF deal
for 2011, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said last month. The
new credit line would serve to shore up investor confidence and
the government will only use it in case of market turbulence,
according to the government.  
 The debt management agency sold 25 billion forint of 2013
bonds at an average yield of 6.92 percent compared with 7.15
percent on July 1. It also raised 15 billion forint in 2016
bonds at 7.22 percent versus 7.5 percent and 15 billion forint
in the 2020 maturity at 7.36 percent compared with 7.68 percent
at a previous auction.  
 Nomura International Plc, BNP Paribas SA and the Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc this month became primary dealers for Hungarian
government securities. Their inclusion may have helped push down
costs and raise the amount of debt sold, said  Tamas Hegedus , a
bond trader at KBC Groep NV’s unit in Budapest.
