             BP Plc, Europe’s largest oil company
by production, plans to shut its North Sea Unity Riser platform
at the start of next month for planned maintenance, potentially
halting output from 18 fields or more in U.K. waters.  
 The riser, a hub for crude oil transported to the U.K.
through some fields connected to the Forties Pipeline System,
will close on Aug. 1 for checks and testing that may last as
many as five days, BP spokesman Matt Taylor said today by phone.
“The maintenance will last a few days, maybe not five.”  
 Offshore fields that produce both oil and gas also won’t be
able to pump gas if the Unity Riser is undergoing maintenance.
The shutdown will halt production from fields including
Britannia, Caledonia, Brodgar, Callanish, Nelson, Howe,
Bardolino, Bruce, Keith, Rhum, Greater Kittiwake Area, Scott
Area, Elgin-Franklin, ETAP and Shearwater, according to a
provisional work schedule seen by Bloomberg in February.  
 Forties, a blend of oil pumped by the pipeline system from
more than 50 fields in the North Sea, is one of four crude
grades used to determine Dated Brent, a benchmark for two-thirds
of the world’s oil. Supplies average about 700,000 barrels a
day, or 40 percent of the U.K. total, according to BP.  
 Supply of Forties will fall 19 percent to 506,000 barrels a
day, from 623,000 in July, according to a  BP website .
