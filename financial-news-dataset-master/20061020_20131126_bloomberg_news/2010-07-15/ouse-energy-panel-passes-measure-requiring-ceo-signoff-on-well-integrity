             A House panel, describing BP Plc’s
decisions before the Gulf oil spill as reckless, approved a
measure that would require chief executive officers of oil
companies to vouch for well designs.  
 The measure, approved today by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee on a 48-0 vote, sets minimum design standards
for wells, adding redundancy, testing and third-party
certification of blowout preventers.  
 “This tragedy, which is the greatest environmental
catastrophe in American history, can be termed ‘accident’ in
name only,” said Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, a California
Democrat. “BP made a series of reckless decisions before the
blowout.”
