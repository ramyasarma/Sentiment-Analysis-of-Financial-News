             Mexico’s peso bonds rose for a third
day, pushing yields to a record low below 7 percent, on
speculation a new economy minister will lure more foreign
investment to the nation.  
 The yield on the 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.939 percent at 5
p.m. New York time, according to Banco Santander SA, the lowest
level since the security was issued in 2005. The price rose 0.73
centavo to 127.89 centavos on the peso.  
 Calderon named  Bruno Ferrari , the head of Mexico’s
investment promotion authority known as Promexico, economy
secretary yesterday.  
 “Since he is coming from Promexico, he is very much
inclined to continue promoting foreign investment in Mexico,”
said  Rafael Camarena , an economist with Banco Santander SA in
Mexico City. “His appointment is causing a nice move.”  
 Ferrari’s predecessor,  Gerardo Ruiz Mateos , focused on
promoting competition, enforcing regulations and reducing
paperwork for businesses, Camarena said. Ferrari’s experience at
Promexico will help promote direct foreign investment, he said.  
 Mexico’s economy may grow 4.4 percent this year, the
fastest growth since 2006, according to the median estimate of
11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Foreign direct investment fell by more than half to $11.4
billion from $23.2 billion last year, as the economy contracted
6.5 percent, the worst recession since the 1930s. Investment by
foreign companies may rise to $20 billion this year, Ruiz Mateos
said in an interview June 29.  
 Yields Drop  
 Yields have plunged 133 basis points this year after the
government sold bonds through a syndicate of banks for the first
time, luring foreign investors to local markets. Citigroup Inc.
said it will add Mexican government debt to its World Government
Bond Index in October.  
 The yields on the bonds may drop to as low as 6.5 percent
by the end of the year because of the inclusion in the Citigroup
index and inflation which has fallen within the central bank’s
target rate for two consecutive months, said  Alonso Madero , who
helps manage 66 billion pesos at Corp. Actinver SAB, in an
interview last week.  
 Consumer prices rose 3.69 percent in June from a year ago,
the second time inflation fell within the central bank’s target
range of between 2 percent and 4 percent. The bank kept its
benchmark interest rate at a record low of 4.5 percent for a
10th meeting in June.  
 Government-regulated pension funds managed 1.28 trillion
pesos in June, regulator Consar said on its website today.  
 Traders didn’t trigger any of the $600 million in dollar
options available today, the central bank said on its website.
The bank has been auctioning the options monthly, allowing it to
purchase dollars to help boost foreign reserves as the peso
reached a record low last year.  
 The peso fell 0.4 percent to 12.7720 per dollar, from
12.7152 yesterday.
