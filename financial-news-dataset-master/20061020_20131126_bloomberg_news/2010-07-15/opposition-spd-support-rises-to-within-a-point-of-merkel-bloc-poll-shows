             Germany’s opposition Social
Democrats rose to within one percentage point of Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic-led bloc, a survey showed
today.  
 The SPD gained two points to 30 percent, with Merkel’s bloc
at 31 percent, according to an Emnid poll commissioned by
broadcaster 24. Merkel’s Free Democrat coalition allies remained
at 6 percent, while the SPD-allied Green Party dropped one point
to 16 percent. The anti-capitalist Left Party was at 11 percent.  
 Merkel’s coalition has been buffeted by infighting over
health reform, extension of nuclear power and deficit cuts as
the country emerges from its worst recession since World War II.  
 The Emnid survey polled 3,272 people from July 5 to 12. No
margin of error was provided.
