             Eisuke Sakakibara , formerly
Japan’s top currency official, said the European Union is
entering a state of “disintegration” that may drag the euro
down to less than 100 yen.  
 The common currency has depreciated this year against
all but one of the major 16 currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
on concern that a Greece-triggered debt crisis will spread to
other European nations. European finance ministers agreed in
June on a rescue fund backed by 440 billion euros ($564
billion) to halt the spread of the credit woes.  
 “Though the euro and European Union won’t disintegrate
immediately, they are entering a state of disintegration from
a long-term view,” Sakakibara, 69, said at a Tokyo seminar
today hosted by Citigroup Inc. and Nikko Cordial Securities
Inc. “The expanded euro region can’t be shrunk. So, what’s
going to happen will be a drop in the euro.”  
 Sakakibara in June said that the euro would fall below
100 yen within the next couple of months. Today he said the
currency will reach that level by the yearend.  
 The euro has rebounded about 5 percent from the more
than eight-year low of 107.32 yen touched on June 29. He said
it was “just short-covering.” The euro traded at 113.02 yen,
compared with 112.66 late yesterday in New York.  
 He also said Japan’s finances aren’t in a state of
crisis because of its financial assets. Sakakibara said the
government can continue to sell “lots of bonds” for at
least four years.  
 Sakakibara became known as “Mr. Yen” during his 1997-
1999 tenure at the Ministry of Finance for his efforts to
influence dollar-yen exchange rates by talking about them in
public or by buying and selling the currencies.  
 In November 2008, Sakakibara correctly forecast that the
yen would strengthen beyond 90 to the dollar because of the
banking crisis. The Japanese currency rose to about 87 to the
dollar on Dec. 17, 2008. Sakakibara is now a professor at
Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo.
