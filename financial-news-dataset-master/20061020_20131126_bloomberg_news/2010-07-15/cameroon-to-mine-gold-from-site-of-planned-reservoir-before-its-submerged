             Cameroon plans to extract six metric
tons of gold from a site in the east of the country before it’s
submerged as part of a hydropower project.  
 The West African nation has contracted the Cameroon Mining
Co., a closely held miner, to dig at Betare-Oya before the area
is flooded to create a reservoir for the Lom Pangar dam, said
Ntep Gweth Paul, who runs the government’s Small Scale Mining
Support and Promotion Unit, in an interview in Yaounde today.  
 Six tons of gold would be worth $234.5 million based on the
price of bullion for immediate delivery at 2 p.m. in London.  
 The dam is being built at the confluence of the Lom and
Pangar rivers in Betare-Oya at a cost of 140 billion CFA francs
($275 million), according to  Louis Paul Motaze , minister for the
economy, planning and regional development. The reservoir will
have the capacity to hold 6 billion cubic meters (1.6 trillion
gallons) of water.  
 Construction of the dam is scheduled to begin in September,
Mines Minister Badel Ndanga Ndinga said in an interview today.
He didn’t say how long Cameroon Mining has to extract the gold
before the site is flooded.  
 Under the terms of the agreement, Cameroon Mining will take
36 percent of the gold to cover production costs and a further
31.5 percent as compensation for its investment.  Cameroon’s 
government will receive 21.5 percent and the remaining 11
percent will be distributed amongst the local population.  
 Cameroon plans to boost gold output from the east of the
country 25-fold over the next five years under a 210 billion-
CFA-franc program, according to the government’s Paul. Output of
the precious metal may rise to 10,000 kilograms (22,046 pounds)
by 2015 from 425 kilograms now, he said on June 18.  
 Annual gold production in Cameroon is about 1,800
kilograms, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .
