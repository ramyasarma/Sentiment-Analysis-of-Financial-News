             Oceania Capital Partners Ltd. wants
to sell its Signature Security Group unit, the Australian
Financial Review reported in its Street Talk column.  
 Oceania has appointed Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty and the unit
may sell for A$120 million to A$180 million, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information. The unit
had earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
of A$26.3 million in the 2009 financial year, it said.
