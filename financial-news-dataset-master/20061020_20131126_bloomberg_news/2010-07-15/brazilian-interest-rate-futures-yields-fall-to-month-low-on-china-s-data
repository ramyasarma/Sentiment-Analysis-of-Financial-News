             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts declined to the lowest level in a month as
China’s economic expansion and industrial production cooled more
than forecast, reducing pressure on the central bank to increase
interest rates.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most-traded
in Sao Paulo, declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 11.18 percent at 8:41 a.m. New York time. Earlier it
touched 11.17 percent, the lowest level on an intraday basis
since June 15.  
 Chinese industrial output rose 13.7 percent in June, less
than all but one of 27 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.
China is Brazil’s biggest trading partner.  
 “Today’s Chinese data that came in below expectations is
helping to drive some receding rates,” said  Nick Chamie , global
head of emerging markets research at RBC Capital Markets in
Toronto. “We’ve passed the peak in growth momentum, and people
are trying to see how deep and how quickly the growth is
slowing.”  
 The real rose 0.4 percent to 1.7559 per dollar, from 1.7625
yesterday.
