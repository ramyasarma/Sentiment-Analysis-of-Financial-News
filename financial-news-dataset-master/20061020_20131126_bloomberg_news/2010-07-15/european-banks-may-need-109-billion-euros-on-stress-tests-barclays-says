             European banks may need to raise
more than 85 billion euros ($109 billion) to bolster their
capital after stress tests, according to Barclays Capital.  
 Spanish savings banks, or cajas, may require 36 billion
euros, German Landesbanks could need 34.5 billion euros, while
the Greek banks may have to raise 8.6 billion euros, according
to analysts led by  Jeffrey Meli  in New York. Portuguese lenders
may require 5.9 billion euros, they estimate.  
 “We view the upcoming release of the European banks stress
tests as a potentially important inflexion point for the
market,” the analysts wrote in the report. “They may ease
concerns by ensuring that the sovereign crisis and a likely
slowdown in European growth will not result in widespread bank
failures.”  
 Investors are concerned that soured loans to real estate
developers and holdings of bonds issued by governments of
nations on Europe’s periphery mean some lenders may have burned
through their capital.  Regulators  are running stress tests on a
total of 91 of the biggest banks, representing 65 percent of the
European industry. The results are due for partial publication
on July 23.
