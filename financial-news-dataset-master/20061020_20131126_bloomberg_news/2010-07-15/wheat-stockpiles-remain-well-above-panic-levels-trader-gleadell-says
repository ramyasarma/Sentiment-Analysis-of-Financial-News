             Wheat stockpiles remain “well above
panic levels” globally even as Russian, French, German and
Kazakh production forecasts drop, said grain trader Gleadell
Agriculture Ltd.  
 Continuing reports of output cuts in key producing regions
in the European Union and the former Soviet Union have added to
“bullish sentiment,” Gainsborough, England-based Gleadell said
in a  report  on its website today.  
 Dry weather is threatening to cut production in Russia,
Kazakhstan and parts of the European Union, while excess
rainfall has damaged grains in Ukraine. That’s helped milling
wheat for November delivery to gain 9.7 percent on NYSE Liffe in
Paris in the past three days.  
 “Weather will remain the key over the next few weeks, with
analysts and traders waiting for harvest to commence, allowing
better assessment of the wheat crop in terms of yield and, more
importantly, quality,” Gleadell said. “Until the combines
start turning, there seems enough buying interest to support the
current rally, with end-users looking to cover spot
requirements.”  
 Higher wheat prices may weigh on the gain in consumption
expected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the trader said.
That might mean end-of-season stocks close to the 187.1 million
metric tons currently forecast, which would leave long-term
sentiment “bearish,” according to the report.  
 “If crops turn out as expected, or with even another
possible 5 to 10 million tons of wheat coming off the global
production, wheat stocks still remain well above panic levels,”
Gleadell said.
