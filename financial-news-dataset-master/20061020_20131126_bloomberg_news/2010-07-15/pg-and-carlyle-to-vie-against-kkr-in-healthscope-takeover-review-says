             TPG Capital and the Carlyle Group
are likely to vie against Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. to win
Healthscope Ltd. with bids for the company to close today, the
Australian Financial Review reported in its Street Talk column.  
 A federal election in Australia may delay completion of any
deal because decisions on foreign investment may be put on hold,
the newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.
