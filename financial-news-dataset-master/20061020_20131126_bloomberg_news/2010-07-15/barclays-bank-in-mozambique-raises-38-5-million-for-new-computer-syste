             Barclays Plc’s Mozambique unit got a
268.2 million-rand capital injection from its shareholders, most
of which it will use to fund a new computer-services system.  
 The money was raised through a sale of shares to existing
shareholders, Johannesburg-based Absa Group Ltd., which owns 80
percent of Barclays Bank Mozambique, said in an e-mailed
statement today. London-based Barclays controls Absa, South
Africa’s largest retail bank.
