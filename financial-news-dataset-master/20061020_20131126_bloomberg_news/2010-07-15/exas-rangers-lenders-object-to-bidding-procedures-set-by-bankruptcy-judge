             Lenders for the Texas Rangers Major
League Baseball franchise objected to bidding procedures ordered
by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge, arguing the new requirements
favor a group including Hall of Fame pitcher  Nolan Ryan .  
 Judge  D. Michael Lynn  in Fort Worth, Texas, today set the
bidding procedures for bankrupt Texas Rangers Baseball Partners,
saying he was doing so in response to a motion by Ryan’s group,
Rangers Baseball Express LLC.  
 A sale of the team will include its contracts, inventory
and rights to membership in Major League Baseball, according to
the Lynn’s order. MLB clearance is required to establish a
bidder as qualified, according to the order. Bids must be
received by 8 p.m. Central Time on Aug. 3 for the Aug. 4
auction.  
 The lenders, including JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, said in
their filing that the court’s timetable is too short to allow
for a competitive auction. The lenders provided $525 million in
loans to  Tom Hicks ’s HSG Sports Group LLC, which owns the team.  
 “The timing is neither necessary, nor reasonable,” the
lenders’ lawyers said. “It is not Lehman Brothers, Chrysler, GM
or any of the other cases where the debtor’s very existence, or
the United States’ economy, hung in the balance.”  
 The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners,
10-43400, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas
(Fort Worth).
