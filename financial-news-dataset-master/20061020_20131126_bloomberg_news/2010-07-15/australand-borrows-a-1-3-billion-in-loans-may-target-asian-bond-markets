             Australand Property Group  may seek
to issue bonds in Singapore, the home of majority shareholder
 CapitaLand Ltd. , as the Australian developer seeks to diversify
its sources of debt financing.  
 “Asian and Singapore markets are the most likely starting
point,” Chief Financial Officer  Kieran Pryke  said in a phone
interview from Sydney today, adding the company has no immediate
sale plans.  
 Australand completed documentation allowing it to access
overseas debt capital markets, it said in a stock exchange
filing today. The company also agreed to A$1.3 billion ($1.1
billion) in new unsecured syndicated loans, replacing A$1.15
billion of secured debt, according to the statement.  
 Australian property firms such as Dexus Property Group and
Mirvac Group are returning to bond markets after the global
credit freeze forced them to sell shares and assets to reduce
debt. The S&P/ASX 200 A-REIT  Index  has risen 59 percent from its
low on March 9 last year as Australia’s economic recovery gained
pace and home prices surged 20 percent in the 12 months to
March.  
 Australand got more than half its  revenue  from residential
property development in 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Developers in Australia need to build about 420,000
more homes in the next 10 years than were built over the past
decade to meet demand, according to the Housing Industry
Association.  
 Loan Price  
 The cost of Australand’s new loans is “in line with
current market rates and is an improvement on margins of the
replaced facilities,” the company said, without elaborating.
Pryke declined to comment further.  
 Australand, which sold more than 1,500 lots for homes and
apartments in 2009, had A$975.8 million of commercial mortgage-
backed bonds and bank facilities outstanding as of Dec. 31,
according to its financial statements. CapitaLand owns 59
percent of Sydney-based Australand, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg.  
 Dexus, Australia’s largest owner and manager of office
properties, sold A$180 million of 7-year, 8.75 percent bonds in
April through its finance unit as part of an exchange offer,
Bloomberg data show. Mirvac sold A$150 million of 8.25 percent,
five-year notes in March.
