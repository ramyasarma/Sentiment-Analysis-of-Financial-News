             Colombia’s peso gained to a nine-
month high on speculation increased foreign investment will
boost dollar inflows into the South American nation.  
 The peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 1,870.40 per U.S.
dollar at 3:04 p.m. New York time, from 1,871.65 yesterday.
That’s the strongest level since Oct. 16. The peso has jumped
9.3 percent this year, the best performance among 31 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “Foreign direct investment flows that are coming into
Colombia are pretty strong,” said  Alexander Cardenas , head of
research at brokerage Acciones y Valores SA in Bogota. “There’s
also speculation about investment grade, which would also
attract more capital from abroad.”  
 Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, which rates Colombia
BB+, or one level below investment grade, on July 7 raised its
outlook on the country’s credit rating to positive from stable.
The move follows comments from  Alessandra Alecci , an analyst
with Moody’s Investors Service, who said in a June 30 interview
that the agency is “optimistic” on Colombia and that there is
“potential” for the country to move toward investment grade.  
 Colombia will attract about $10 billion in  foreign direct
investment  this year, Trade Minister  Luis Guillermo Plata  has
said. The nation received $7.2 billion of foreign direct
investment in 2009 -- of which 80 percent went into oil, coal
and mining -- after a record $10.6 billion the previous year,
according to the central bank.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.55
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price fell 0.178 centavo to 123.680 centavos per peso.
