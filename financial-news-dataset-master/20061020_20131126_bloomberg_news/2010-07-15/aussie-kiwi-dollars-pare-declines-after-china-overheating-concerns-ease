             The Australian and New Zealand
dollars pared initial declines after China’s gross domestic
product growth and inflation eased in the first half, signaling
a diminished risk of economic overheating.  
 The Australian dollar traded at 88.20 U.S. cents as of
12:06 p.m. in Sydney, after earlier dropping to as low as 87.80
cents, from 88.51 cents yesterday in New York. New Zealand’s
dollar was at 72.25 U.S. cents from 72.42 cents yesterday, after
touching 71.92 cents.
