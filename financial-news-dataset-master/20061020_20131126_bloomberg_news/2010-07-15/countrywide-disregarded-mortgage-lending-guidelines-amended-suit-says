             Countrywide Financial Corp. , the
mortgage lender acquired by Bank of America Corp., systemically
disregarded lending guidelines in the loans it underwrote,
according to an amended lawsuit by investors.  
 Documents for mortgages originated by Countrywide and later
securitized contained misrepresentations and omissions, and
didn’t follow the lender’s own guidelines, the investors said in
the 146-page complaint.  
 “Despite assurances by the defendants in the offering
documents that mortgage loans collateralizing the certificates
were originated pursuant to stated guidelines, nothing could
have been further from the truth,” the plaintiffs said.  
 The complaint, which seeks group status on behalf of
investors who claim to have purchased $351 billion of mortgage-
backed securities, was filed today. A copy was posted on a
 website  by lawyers representing the plaintiffs and couldn’t be
independently verified.  
 The suit, which alleges violations of federal securities
laws, was first filed in January.  
 Bank of America spokeswoman  Shirley Norton  declined to
comment.  
 The case is Maine State Retirement System v. Countrywide,
10-cv-00302, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Los Angeles).
