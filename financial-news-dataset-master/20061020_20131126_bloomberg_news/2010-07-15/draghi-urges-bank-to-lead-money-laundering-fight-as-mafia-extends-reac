             European Central Bank council member
 Mario Draghi  said senior executives at banks must lead the fight
against money laundering as organized crime groups increasingly
infiltrate the real economy.  
 “The role of the top management at the banks is crucial,”
Draghi, who is also Bank of Italy governor, said today during a
speech to the country’s banking association in Rome.
“Criminals, thanks to the crisis, have extended their reach
into the economy at all levels.”  
 Earlier this week, police arrested more than 300 members
and associates of the ’Ndrangheta mafia, which had extended its
business activities to Milan, Italy’s financial capital located
just 40 miles from the Alps, from its territory in Calabria, at
the toe of the boot-shaped peninsula. The country’s main crime
groups, including the ‘Ndrangheta, boosted their estimated
revenue by 4 percent to 135 billion euros ($173 billion) last
year, according to anti-racketeering group SOS Impresa.  
 In late 2009 and early 2010, inspections at 120 banks
showed that screening of clients, training of personnel and
reporting of suspicious transactions had been inadequate, Draghi
said. While in most cases no criminal complicity was involved,
“defects in management” led to poor screening, he said.
