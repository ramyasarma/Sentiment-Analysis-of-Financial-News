             Oracle Corp . Chief Executive Officer
 Larry Ellison  is close to buying the National Basketball
Association’s Golden State Warriors, the  San Francisco Chronicle
reported , citing people with knowledge of the negotiations.  
 Ellison outbid  Mark Mastrov , founder of 24-Hour Fitness
Worldwide, and others to purchase 80 percent of the Oakland,
California-based team, the newspaper said. The minority
shareholders would keep their interests.  
 The price may top the NBA-record $401 million paid for the
Phoenix Suns in 2004, the Chronicle said.  
 Ellison’s other sports interests include the BMW Oracle
team that won sailing’s America’s Cup in Valencia, Spain.  
 Under the ownership of  Chris Cohan , Golden State has posted
a 477-803 record over 16 seasons, the second-worst during that
period behind the Los Angeles Clippers, the newspaper said. The
team has made one playoff appearance, less than any other NBA
team in the time Cohan has owned it.
