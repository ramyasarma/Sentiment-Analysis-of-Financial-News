             Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB  Index
dropped the most in two weeks, falling 324.29, or 1.6 percent,
to 20,480.08 in Milan.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  
 Atlantia SpA  (ATL IM), Italy’s largest toll highway
operator, fell 37 cents, or 2.4 percent, to 15.17 euros, a
second day of losses, after Standard & Poor’s cut its outlook to
“negative” from “stable.” Equita Sim SpA, which has a
“buy” on the stock, said in a note that the market wasn’t
expecting S&P’s decision and “we will have to wait and see if
it will affect Atlantia’s dividend policy.”  
 Separately, Abertis Infraestructuras SA will sell its 14.5
percent stake in Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal SA and its 6
percent stake in Atlantia ahead of a planned takeover bid led by
CVC Capital Partners Ltd., El Confidencial reported, citing
unidentified people at the companies.  
 Banco Popolare SC  (BP IM) sank 11.5 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to 4.69 euros. Italy’s fourth-largest lender, was cut to
“neutral” from “outperform” at Exane BNP Paribas, which
cited a “not sufficiently cheap valuation” and said that
“reimbursement of the Tremonti bonds remains an issue for Banca
Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS IM) and Banco Popolare in
the environment of very low profitability in which Italian banks
are operating.”  
 The brokerage trimmed its price estimate on Monte dei
Paschi, Italy’s third-biggest bank, by 2 percent to 1.08 euros
with a “neutral” rating unchanged. Monte dei Paschi dropped
2.3 percent to 95.6 cents.  
 Eni SpA  (ENI IM), Italy’s biggest oil company, fell 21
cents, or 1.3 percent, to 15.65 euros, ending a two-day
increase. Crude oil tumbled after government reports bolstered
concern that the U.S. economic recovery will slow, reducing
demand for crude, and equities declined.  
 Tenaris SA  (TEN IM), the world’s biggest maker of seamless
steel tubes for oil and gas extraction, declined 27 cents, or
1.8 percent, to 14.99 euros.  
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM) and  UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM),
Italy’s biggest banks, dropped 2.6 percent to 2.4 euros and 1.9
percent to 2.03 euros, respectively. A gauge for European banks
fell the most in two weeks.  
 Lottomatica SpA  (LTO IM)) gained 51 cents, or 4.7 percent,
to 11.36 euros, as shares of the lottery company rose above
their 20-day moving average.  
 Intermonte Sim SpA trimmed its price estimate to 15.5 euros
from 16.5 euros because of “lower estimates for Italian lottery
wagers after the weak first half.” Still, the brokerage
reiterated an “outperform” rating as it expects “positive
news flow from quarterly results.”
