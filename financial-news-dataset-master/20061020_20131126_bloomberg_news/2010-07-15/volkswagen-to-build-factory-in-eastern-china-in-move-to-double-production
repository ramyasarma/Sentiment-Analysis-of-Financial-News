             Volkswagen AG , Europe’s largest
carmaker, will build an assembly plant in eastern China as part
of a plan to double capacity in the world’s biggest auto market
within four years.  
 The factory in Yizheng, Jiansu province, will have a
capacity to build 300,000 vehicles and will begin production in
2013, Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen said in a statement
today. VW announced plans last month to build a factory in
Foshan in the southern province of Guangdong.  
 The two factories will increase VW’s production sites in
China to 11 and give the carmaker an annual capacity in the
country of 3 million vehicles. VW is investing 6 billion euros
($7.7 billion) to expand in the country as vehicle sales boom.  
 “It’s a sensible step to take as China’s long-term growth
prospects still have to be judged very positively,” said Marc-
Rene Tonn, an analyst at M.M. Warburg in Hamburg, who recommends
buying VW  shares .  
 Volkswagen, the biggest foreign carmaker in China, boosted
sales in that market by 46 percent in the first six months to
950,278 vehicles. VW sold 1.4 million cars and sport-utility
vehicles in China last year and aims to more than double output
to 3 million units as early as 2013, Chief Executive Officer
 Martin Winterkorn  said on June 9.  
 ‘Vital Market’  
 The manufacturer has added models including the Tiguan
sport-utility vehicle, the Audi Q5 and an upgraded Jetta this
year to boost deliveries in its biggest market. VW started sales
of the CC four-door sports coupe today in Shanghai.  
 “China’s low vehicle penetration rate makes it a vital
market for companies like Volkswagen,” said Qin Xuwen, an
analyst at Orient Securities Co. in Shanghai.  
 Sales of cars, sport-utility vehicles and multipurpose
vehicles in China rose 10.9 percent in June to 839,228,
according to the China Automotive Technology & Research Center.
Growth slowed from 25 percent in May and 34 percent in April as
inflation accelerated, reducing consumers’ purchasing power.  
 China is critical to Winterkorn’s goal of surpassing Toyota
Motor Corp. in sales and profitability by 2018. VW will build
the Foshan plant with its Chinese partners, FAW Volkswagen
Automotive Company Ltd., and said today that the Yizheng factory
will be set up with its second joint venture, the Shanghai
Volkswagen Automotive Company Ltd.  
 Daimler, Nissan  
 VW’s preferred shares  fell  as much as 1.27 euros, or 1.6
percent, to 76.03 euros and were down 0.5 percent at 10:30 a.m.
in Frankfurt, valuing the company at 34.5 billion euros.  
 Daimler AG , the world’s second-largest luxury carmaker,
announced plans in May to build a Chinese engine factory as part
of a 3 billion-euro investment there. Nissan Motor Co. is
enlarging its plant in Guangdong and aims to build as many as
600,000 vehicles there a year by 2012, from 430,000 units
currently, the company said in April.  
 Honda Motor Co. said in May that it plans to double the
capacity of its Zengcheng plant to 240,000 vehicles a year by
the second half of 2011. The expansion will raise Guangqi
Honda’s total capacity in Guangzhou by a third to 480,000 units
annually from 360,000. Toyota said on April 28 it will start
building Corolla cars at a factory in Changchun in the first
half of 2012.
