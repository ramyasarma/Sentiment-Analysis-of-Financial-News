             Chinese Internet media company  Sina
Corp.  rose the most in eight months in New York after
Susquehanna upgraded the shares to “positive” from “neutral”
and said the company’s microblogging network, Sina Weibo, will
expand to as many as 120 million users by 2012.  
 Sina climbed 8.4 percent to $39.72, the  biggest gain  since
Nov. 17. Susquehanna’s target price is $50 per share.  
 “We are amazed by what Sina has achieved in Sina Weibo
microblogging, and believe this new media and social network
will add huge value to Sina,” equity analyst  C. Ming Zhao  wrote
in a report today. “We believe this user-generated media, as
well as social network, are extremely attractive to businesses
for building brand images and promoting products and services.”  
 Susquehanna estimated the “Twitter-like service” had 15
million to 20 million users at the end of the first half of
2010, and is forecasting the social network will expand to 50
million users by the end of the year.
