             Japanese  stocks  fell, dragging down
the Topix index by the most in five weeks, as concern mounted
that a global economic recovery will stall after U.S. retail
sales declined and the Federal Reserve cut its growth forecast.  
 Nissan Motor Co. , a carmaker that counts North America as
its biggest market, retreated 3.3 percent. Canon Inc., which is
the world’s largest maker of cameras and gets about 80 percent
of its revenue outside Japan, lost 2.5 percent. Nippon Yusen
K.K., Japan’s biggest shipping line, slumped 2.6 percent on
lower cargo rates. Resona Holdings Inc. plunged 5.3 percent on
speculation the bank will sell shares.  
 “The worst is already behind us, but the strength of the
recovery is weak,” said  Masayuki Kubota , a fund manager at
Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which oversees about $51
billion in assets. “Concerns remain about the future once
support from economic measures expires.”  
 The  Topix  sank 1.6 percent to 856.60 at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo, its biggest drop since June 7. About eight stocks
retreated for each that advanced. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
fell 1.1 percent to 9,685.53. Both gauges closed yesterday at
their highest levels since June 24.  
 The Topix declined the most among benchmark indexes in the
Asia-Pacific region. It has decreased 5.6 percent this year on
concern that Europe’s government-debt crisis and China’s moves
to cool inflation will hamper a global economic recovery. Stocks
in the gauge trade at 16.7 times  estimated earnings  on average.
They were at 16.1 times on July 1, the lowest level since 2008.  
 Retail Sales, Fed  
 In New York yesterday, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
slipped less than 0.1 percent as the decline in retail sales and
the Federal Reserve’s outlook overshadowed a forecast for record
profit by Intel Corp.  
 Canon lost 2.5 percent to 3,490 yen today.  Sony Corp. , an
electronics maker that gets 22 percent of sales in the U.S.,
fell 2.4 percent to 2,530 yen. Nissan sank 3.3 percent to 648
yen.  Honda Motor Co. , a carmaker that derives almost 85 percent
of its sales abroad, dropped 2.2 percent to 2,682 yen.  
 Electronics companies were the  biggest drag  on the Topix
among the index’s 33 industry groups, followed by banks and
carmakers. All but one group fell today.  
 Sales at U.S. retailers dropped 0.5 percent in June, more
than projected, after declining 1.1 percent in May, Commerce
Department figures showed yesterday in Washington.  
 ‘Economic Outlook Softened’  
 “The economic outlook had softened somewhat and a number
of members saw the risks to the outlook as having shifted to the
downside,” according to minutes released yesterday of a June
meeting of Federal Reserve officials. U.S. central bankers
lowered their central tendency forecast for 2010 growth to a
range of between 3 percent and 3.5 percent versus 3.2 percent to
3.7 percent in April, the minutes showed.  
 Equities briefly pared losses today after reports from
China showed slowing economic expansion and inflation, boosting
speculation the government won’t seek to curb growth further.
Declines accelerated this afternoon as concern increased that
slowing expansion will jeopardize a worldwide economic recovery.  
 The strengthening yen further hurt stocks, reducing
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency. The yen appreciated to as much as 88.02 against
the dollar today in Tokyo, compared with 88.92 at the close of
stock trading yesterday. Against the euro, it strengthened to
112.06 from 112.99.  
 Resona Holdings  tumbled 5.3 percent to 975 yen, the biggest
drop in the Nikkei 225, on speculation the bank will sell shares
to repay government funds. A spokesman for the lender declined
to comment.  
 Resona Rumor  
 “There is a rumor Resona may be trying to raise capital to
pay off the government,” said  Ismael Pili , a Tokyo-based
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. “The rumor is gaining
momentum.”  
 Shipping lines had the second-biggest  percentage decline 
among the Topix’s industry groups. Nippon Yusen slumped 2.6
percent to 332 yen. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., which operates the
world’s largest merchant fleet, lost 3.6 percent to 590 yen, the
most since May 25. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Japan’s No. 3
shipping line, lost 2.9 percent to 368 yen.  
 The  Baltic Dry Index  of freight rates to ship bulk
commodities plunged 4.5 percent yesterday in London in its 34th
consecutive decline, the longest losing streak since August 2001.  
 “Investors are trying to avoid risks,” said  Takero Inaizumi , head of equity research in Tokyo at Mizuho Investors
Securities Co. “Market participants are still concerned the
global economy may head into a double dip after economic-
stimulus measures expire.”
