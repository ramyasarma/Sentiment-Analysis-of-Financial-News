             U.K.  house prices  will fall through
2012 as the deepest public-spending cuts since World War II and
tighter credit conditions deter potential buyers,  Capital
Economics  Ltd. said.  
 Home values will drop 5 percent this year and 10 percent in
each of the next two years, economists including  Roger Bootle 
and  Ed Stansfield  said in a note issued to clients this week.
The 2012 forecast “is highly uncertain,” they said.  
 The U.K. housing-market recovery has shown signs of cooling
this year as consumers brace for the government’s budget
squeeze. While the  Bank of England  has held its  benchmark
interest rate  at a record low 0.5 percent since March 2009,
banks are granting only about half the number of mortgages they
did during the market’s peak in 2007.  
 “The subdued outlook for activity is one reason why we
believe that last year’s gains in  house prices  will prove to be
a false dawn,” the economists said in the report. “Even though
interest rates have been cut to record lows, affordability
remains far less favourable than following previous house-price
corrections.”
