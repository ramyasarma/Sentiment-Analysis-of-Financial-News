             Investors should purchase one-month
options on the euro versus the pound, yen and Hungarian forint
to profit from a likely rebound in volatility after July’s
slide, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 Option implied volatility, a gauge of trader expectations
for future currency swings, has tumbled since June as the euro
rebounded almost 9 percent versus the dollar. One-month implied
volatility on euro-yen options touched as low as 14.43 percent
today, compared with 19.44 percent on June 30 and a 15-month
high of 25.13 percent on May 21.  
 “Implied volatilities have come off dramatically, much
more so than the recent rise,” wrote  Chris Fuligni , a currency
options strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford,
Connecticut, in a research note today. “The move lower in
implied volatility appears to be too large relative to the
recent spot move.”  
 The current difference between implied and historic
volatility, which measures the actual pace of currency swings,
are among a group of metrics that signal these options are
attractive to buyers, according to Fuligni.  
 Two-week historic volatility on the euro exchange rate,
used in Fuligni’s analysis, is about 5.6 percent versus the
pound, 6.6 percent versus the forint and 9.3 percent versus the
yen, according to RBS data.  
 The 16-nation euro rallied above $1.29 today for the first
time since May as demand at Spain’s government bond sale eased
concern that nations in the currency region won’t be able to
fund their deficits.  
 The euro appreciated 1.2 percent to $1.2901, from $1.2743
yesterday, after touching $1.2918, the highest level since May
10. The euro slid 0.2 percent to 112.43 yen, from 112.66.  
 The dollar weakened as economic reports showed
manufacturing in the New York and Philadelphia regions expanded
at the slowest pace this year.  
 Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s June 23 meeting released
yesterday showed policy makers trimmed their forecasts for
growth and said risks to the recovery had increased, also
weighing on the dollar.
