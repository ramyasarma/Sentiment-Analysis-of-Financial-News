             Japanese opposition  Your Party  will
see its public subsidy almost double after increasing its
strength in the  upper house  of parliament to 11 from one in this
week’s elections, Kyodo News said, citing its own calculations.  
 Your Party, formed by  Yoshimi Watanabe  last August, will
now get about 675 million yen ($7.6 million) in taxpayer funds
this year, up from its previous allocation of 361 million yen,
Kyodo said. Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s  Democratic Party of Japan ,
which lost 10 seats on July 11, will collect 1.7 billion yen,
220 million yen less than originally allocated, the report said.  
 The government won’t announce the official figures until
next year.  
 Political subsides are distributed four times a year
according to the number of seats and votes won in the latest
election, and the next payment will be made in October. The fund
this year totals about 32 billion yen, according to the Internal
Affairs Ministry. Parties must report how the money is spent.
