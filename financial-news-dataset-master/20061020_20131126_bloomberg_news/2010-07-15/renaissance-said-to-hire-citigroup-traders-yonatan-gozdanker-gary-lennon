             Renaissance Capital will hire
Citigroup Inc.’s  Yonatan Gozdanker ,  Gary Lennon  and  Vadim Varvarin , senior sales traders covering Russia, South Africa 
and the Middle East, to expand its emerging-market trading desk.  
 Gozdanker, who oversaw traders in London, New York, Moscow,
Johannesburg, Warsaw, Dubai and Istanbul, will join as global
head of cash equities and Lennon will lead sales trading, 
according to an e-mailed statement from Renaissance. Varvarin
will be on the sales trading team, the statement said. They will
work in London, said Renaissance spokeswoman Daria Khilenkova.  
 Gozdanker was  Citigroup ’s head of equity trading for the
region of Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, or CEEMEA, and earlier worked at Merrill Lynch & Co. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Renaissance said. Lennon was head of
Citigroup’s CEEMEA sales trading and was previously at Merrill
Lynch, according to the statement.  
 Renaissance, half-owned by billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ,
has recruited more than 100 bankers this year and plans to add a
total 200 to 250 in its offices from New York to Lagos, Accra
and Almaty, the company has said. The Moscow-based bank hired
hedge fund manager and former Credit Suisse Group AG banker
 Christopher Carter  in May to run its equity derivatives team.
 Nick Andrews  joined in February from JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Hong
Kong division as global head of equities.  
 Lennon didn’t return calls and Gozdanker couldn’t be
reached.  Jeffrey French , a Citigroup spokesman in London,
declined to comment.  
 Sales have expanded “significantly” since RenCap
completed its purchase of Barnard Jacobs Mellet Securities Ltd.
on July 13 and added metals traders for Africa and Hong Kong,
Andrews said by phone today.
