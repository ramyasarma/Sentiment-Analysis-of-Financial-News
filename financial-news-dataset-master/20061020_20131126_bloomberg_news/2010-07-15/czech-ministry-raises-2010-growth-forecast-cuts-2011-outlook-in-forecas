             The Czech economy will grow faster
this year than previously expected, driven mainly by an increase
in exports to the country’s main trading partners in western
Europe, the Finance Ministry said.  
 The ministry in Prague revised its outlook for 2010 gross
domestic product growth to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent, it said
in a quarterly update of economic forecasts posted today on its
 website . The economy should expand 2.3 percent next year, less
than the previously forecast 2.4 percent.  
 “The Czech economy exited a recession one year ago and
output has been rising since the third quarter of 2009,” the
ministry’s forecast said. “However, the recovery remains
fragile and future developments are clouded by significant
risks, especially from the external environment.”  
 The  economy  is benefiting from a recovery in its main
trading partners in western Europe as demand grows for cars made
in the country by Volkswagen’s Skoda Auto AS and Hyundai Motor
Co. GDP rose 1.1 percent on an annual basis in the first three
months, the first increase in five quarters.  
 The ministry also forecast average inflation of “about”
1.6 percent for 2010, and saw consumer price growth accelerating
to 2.5 percent next year.  
 Assumptions  
 The new forecast is based on an assumption that the
koruna’s average exchange rate will be 25.5 per euro this year
and 24.6 per euro next year. The local currency traded at
25.474 per euro at 3 p.m. in Prague, little changed from
yesterday.  
 Faster economic growth may help the government narrow the
public-finance deficit, which widened to 5.9 percent of GDP last
year as the economy slipped into the worst recession since the
demise of communism 20 years ago. The government of Prime
Minister  Petr Necas , named on July 12, wants to cut the gap to
4.6 percent next year, from the targeted 5.3 percent in 2010.  
 The new government also plans to bring the deficit, the
fiscal gauge for assessing a European Union member’s readiness
to join the euro area, to within the bloc’s limit of 3 percent
of GDP by 2013, which is in line with Brussels’ requirements.  
 The Cabinet’s efforts to curb the fiscal shortfall will
hurt economic growth next year when the expansion should not
exceed 2 percent, Raiffeisenbank AS in Prague said in a report
today before the Finance Ministry published its forecasts.
