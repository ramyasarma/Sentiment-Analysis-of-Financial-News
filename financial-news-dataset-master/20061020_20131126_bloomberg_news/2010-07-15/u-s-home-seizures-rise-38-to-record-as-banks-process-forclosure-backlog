             A record 269,962 U.S. homes were
seized from delinquent owners in the second quarter as lenders
set a pace to claim more than 1 million properties by the end of
2010, according to  RealtyTrac Inc .  
 Home seizures climbed 38 percent from a year earlier and 5
percent from the first quarter, the Irvine, California-based
data company said today in a statement. More than 1.65 million
properties received a  foreclosure filing , including notices of
default, auction and bank repossession, in the first half. That
was up 8 percent from the first six months of 2009.  
 “Foreclosures haven’t peaked yet,”  Nicolas Retsinas ,
director of Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing
Studies in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said in a telephone
interview. Unemployment suggests that bank repossessions may
climb for another six to nine months, he said.  
 Waning consumer confidence and the  jobless rate , which was
9.5 percent in June, are holding back a housing recovery. The
expiration of a federal tax credit for homebuyers also cut
demand, even as average borrowing costs for a 30-year fixed-rate
loan set record lows. The rate was 4.57 percent last week,
according to McLean, Virginia-based mortgage finance company
Freddie Mac.  
 “It’s not interest rates that will get us out of this, but
jobs,” Retsinas said. “New defaults seem to have stabilized,
but there’s still a lot of volatility overall.”  
 One in 78 U.S. households received a  foreclosure  filing in
the first half, and filings surpassed 300,000 for the 16th
consecutive month in June, RealtyTrac said. A total of 529,633
homes were seized by lenders -- the last stage of the
foreclosure process -- in the first half, said  Daren Blomquist ,
the data firm’s marketing manager.  
 Clearing Backlog  
 Banks are trying to avert foreclosure in some cases by
modifying loans or attempting short sales, where a property is
sold for less than the amount owed. That’s pushing down the
number of new default notices even as lenders “cleared out a
backlog” and seized more homes,  James J. Saccacio , RealtyTrac’s
chief executive officer, said in the statement.  
 The number of  properties  that got a filing from April
through June totaled 895,521, a 4 percent drop from the previous
quarter and little changed from a year earlier. Total filings
for the year are forecast to exceed 3 million, according to the
data company.  
 “While the foreclosure problem is being managed on the
surface, a massive number of distressed properties and
underwater loans continues to sit just below the surface,
threatening the fragile stability of the housing market,”
Saccachio said.  
 Nevada, Arizona  
 Nevada  had the highest foreclosure rate, as one in 17
households received a filing in the first half. The number of
properties that got a notice totaled 64,429, down 13 percent
from the previous six months and 6 percent from a year earlier.  
 Arizona ranked second at one in 30 households and Florida
was third at one in 32. Rounding out the 10 highest rates were
California, Utah, Georgia, Michigan, Idaho, Illinois and
Colorado.  
 California  led in total filings as 340,740 properties got a
notice, down 15 percent from the previous six months and almost
13 percent from a year earlier, according to RealtyTrac.  
 Florida  was second with 277,073 properties, down 9 percent
from the previous six months and up 3 percent from the first
half of 2009. Arizona was third at 91,484, down almost 2 percent
from the previous period and up by a similar proportion from a
year earlier.  
 Other states among the 10 highest totals were Illinois at
85,223; Michigan at 78,509; Georgia at 71,949; Texas at 64,883;
Nevada at 64,429; Ohio at 59,927; and New Jersey at 36,542.  
 RealtyTrac sells default data from more than 2,200 counties
representing 90 percent of the U.S. population.
