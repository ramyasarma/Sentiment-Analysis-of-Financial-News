             Visteon Corp. ’s shareholders can’t
file their own plan to reorganize the bankrupt auto-parts maker,
a judge ruled today in giving managers more time to try to get
their proposal approved.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Christopher S. Sontchi  in Wilmington,
Delaware, allowed managers to retain control of the company’s
reorganization process, saying he had made his intentions clear
the last time the issue came up.  
 “Why am I hearing this again?” Sontchi asked lawyers in
the case as the hearing began.  
 “We are retreading ground that we have gone over and over
again,” Sontchi said after denying the shareholder’s request.
“I haven’t heard anything new today.”  
 Visteon, based in Van Buren Township, Michigan, was spun
off from  Ford Motor Co.  in 2000. Since filing for bankruptcy
last year, Visteon’s creditors have fought among themselves for
control of the company, with different groups forming alliances.  
 Shareholders have tried before to persuade Sontchi to end
the company’s exclusive right to win court approval for a
reorganization plan.  
 The case is In re Visteon Corp., 09-11786, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
