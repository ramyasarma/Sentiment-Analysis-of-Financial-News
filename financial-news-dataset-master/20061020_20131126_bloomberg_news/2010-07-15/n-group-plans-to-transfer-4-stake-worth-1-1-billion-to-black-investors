             MTN Group Ltd. , Africa’s largest
mobile-phone operator, will sell as much as 4 percent of its
business worth about 8.1 billion rand ($1.1 billion) to black
investors and employees to comply with South African laws.  
 Black economic empowerment, or BEE, “is integral to the
ethos of MTN, and MTN believes that broad-based BEE
participation is important to its future success as a group,”
Chief Executive Officer  Phuthuma Nhleko  said in an e-mailed
statement. The sale “translates to an additional effective
indirect black ownership” in the South African operations of
as much as 29.1 percent, the Johannesburg-based company said.  
 South African companies are required by law to sell stakes
to black shareholders to increase black people’s ownership and
participation in the country’s economy to make up for exclusion
under apartheid, which ended in 1994. MTN’s South African
assets account for 22.9 percent of the company’s value, it
said.  
 MTN will assist black investors to raise money to buy
shares, according to the statement. The offer is expected to
open to the public on 30 Aug., the company said.  
 MTN shares  rose 1.3 percent to 111.37 rand at 12:51 p.m.
in Johannesburg trading.
