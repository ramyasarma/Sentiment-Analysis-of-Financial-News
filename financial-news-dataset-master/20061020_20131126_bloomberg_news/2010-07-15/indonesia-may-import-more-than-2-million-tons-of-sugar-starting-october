             Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest
sugar buyer, is expected to import more than 2 million metric
tons in the year starting October to meet increasing domestic
demand, according to the Indonesia Sugar Association.  
 “Imports may be higher as non-stop rains will probably
reduce sugar content in cane,” Faruk Bakrie, chairman of the
association, said in an interview in Bali today.  
 The country imported 1.67 million tons of raw sugar and
379,000 tons of refined sugar in the 2009 crop year, he said.
