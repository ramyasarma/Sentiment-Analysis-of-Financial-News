             Cricket South Africa said it expects
to lure the largest crowd to a cricket match in the country by
hosting a 20-20 match between India and South Africa at a
stadium built for the soccer World Cup.  
 The match will take place at Moses Mabhida Stadium in
Durban, on South Africa’s east coast on Jan. 9,  Michael Owen- Smith , a spokesman for Cricket South Africa, said in a mobile-
phone interview today. The stadium has the capacity to seat
70,000 people, more than double that of South Africa’s largest
cricket grounds, the  Wanderers , which seats 34,000.  
 South African stadiums built to host the monthlong soccer
World Cup, which ended on July 11, are targeting other sporting
codes and events to recover the costs of building and
maintaining them. South Africa’s rugby team, known as the
Springboks, will play their rivals from New Zealand at the
90,000-seat Soccer City in Johannesburg on Aug. 21.  
 The Durban game “will attract the biggest crowd ever to a
cricket match in South Africa,” Owen-Smith said. The  Melbourne
Cricket Stadium  in Australia is the world’s largest cricket
stadium, with a total capacity of 100,000, according to its
website.  
 India has “massive support” in Durban, Owen-Smith said.
The match will be played in celebration of the 150th anniversary
of the arrival of Indians in South Africa, he said.  
 Between 1860 and 1911 more than 152,000 Indian laborers
arrived in the KwaZulu-Natal province, of which Durban is its
largest city, to work on sugar-cane plantations. The province
has the highest proportion of South Africans of Indian
descendant living in the country, where Indians and Asians
account for 2.5 percent of the population of 47.9 million,
according to mid-2007 estimates by Statistics South Africa.  
 Moses Mabhida meets the requirements of the International
Cricket Council to host 20-20 cricket, Kevin Gramoney,
groundsman for the stadium, said in a  statement  on the stadium’s
website.
