             Rising demand at a sale of 3 billion
euros ($3.8 billion) of 15-year Spanish bonds today shows that
investors have an “appetite” for higher yields, said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed income strategist at Monument Securities Ltd.  
 “People are looking at some of the yields in the
periphery, in the non-core,” Ostwald said in a telephone
interview from London. “When yields on bunds are so low it
encourages people to go in.”  
 Spain sold 3 billion euros of 15-year bonds, attracting
bids worth 2.57 times the securities offered, compared with 1.79
the last time they were sold in April.   
 The extra  yield , or spread, investors demand to hold
Spanish 10-year debt instead of equivalent-maturity German
bunds, Europe’s benchmark government securities, narrowed eight
basis points to 199 basis points as of 11:12 a.m. in London. The
spread narrowed from 221 basis points on June 16, the most since
September 1996.
