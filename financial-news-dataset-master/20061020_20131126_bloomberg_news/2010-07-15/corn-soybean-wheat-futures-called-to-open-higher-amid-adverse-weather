             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 4 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade amid speculation that hot,
dry weather next week will damage Midwest plants as they develop
kernels, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in
Fowler, Indiana.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher
on concern that hot, dry conditions in the next six weeks will
reduce U.S. production as global demand increases, Gerlach said.
Soybean-meal futures may open $3 to $5 higher per 2,000 pounds,
and soybean oil is expected to open 0.35 to 0.45 cent a pound
higher, he said.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 13 cents to 15 cents higher on the
CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis Grain
Exchange as adverse weather damages crops in exporting nations
including Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany, Gerlach said
