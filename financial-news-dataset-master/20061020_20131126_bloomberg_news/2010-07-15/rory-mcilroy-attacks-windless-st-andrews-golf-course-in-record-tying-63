             Rory McIlroy  took advantage of
windless conditions to shoot 63 at the British Open and tie the
record for lowest score in a major golf championship.  
 The 21-year-old from Northern Ireland finished 9 under par
on the Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland, to take the first-
round lead. It’s the 24th 63 in major history and the first
since  Tiger Woods  at the 2007 U.S. PGA Championship.  
 “Obviously there’s been a lot of rain over the past couple
of days and going out this morning with no wind, you’re never
going to get St. Andrews playing any easier,” McIlroy said in a
news conference.  
 McIlroy was 1-under when he drove the 352-yard, par-4 ninth
hole and sank the 15-foot putt for eagle. Then came five birdies
over the next seven holes before he missed a three-foot birdie
putt on 17. He then added a final birdie at the 18th.  
 “It’s a pretty impressive round, no doubt,” top-ranked
Tiger Woods, who shot 67, told reporters. “Rory kept it
going.”  
 McIlroy said he briefly thought about breaking the record
before missing the short putt on the next-to-last hole.  
 “It sort of went through my mind on 17 that 62 would have
been the lowest round in a major,” he said. “That’s probably
why I missed it.”  
 McIlroy has had plenty of success at St. Andrews. He’s
played nine rounds there since 2007, six as an amateur, and has
never shot 70 or above.  
 “This course, I just love the place,” he said. “If I had
one course to play, this would probably be the course, because
it’s just an enjoyable golf course.  
 McIlroy shot a final-round 62 in May to win the U.S. PGA
Tour’s Quail Hollow Championship. He missed the cut at the
year’s first two majors, the Masters Tournament and the U.S.
Open  
 He’s the eighth player to shoot 63 at the British Open and
the first since  Nick Faldo  and  Payne Stewart  at Royal St.
George’s in 1993.  Paul Broadhurst  had the only other 63 in the
Open at St. Andrews, in 1990.
