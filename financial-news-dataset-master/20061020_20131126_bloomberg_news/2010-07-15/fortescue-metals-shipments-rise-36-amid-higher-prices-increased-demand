             Fortescue Metals Group Ltd .,
Australia’s third-biggest producer of iron ore, said fourth-
quarter shipments rose 36 percent as production increased to
benefit from higher prices and demand from steel mills.  
 Shipments were 11.04 million metric tons in the three
months ended June 30, from 8.14 million tons a year ago, Perth-
based Fortescue said today in a statement. That’s higher than
Credit Suisse Group AG’s forecast of about 10.5 million tons.  
 “Fortescue had a very strong quarter and they’re in a
strong position to take advantage of the strength in the iron
ore market,” said Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analyst
 Lyndon Fagan  by phone from Sydney.  
 Fortescue plans to expand annual output from its Chichester
operation to 55 million tons by 2011, and may start work on the
$9 billion Solomon project in the first quarter next year. Cash
prices for iron ore reached a high for the year in April.  
 “Fortescue continued to experience strong demand for its
product across its customer base of around 40 steel mills,” the
company said in the statement. Higher prices and no maintenance
shutdowns resulted in double-digit growth, it said.  
 Shares in  Fortescue  declined 4.1 percent to A$4.20 at 4:10
p.m. Sydney time close on the Australian stock exchange.  
 Output this quarter may drop to between 9 million tons and
10 million tons because of scheduled maintenance, the company
said.  
 Production costs increased to $32.25 a ton from $29.43 a
ton in the March quarter, the company said.  
 Separately, the company increased the total resource
estimate for the Solomon project to 2.86 billion tons from 2.7
billion tons.
