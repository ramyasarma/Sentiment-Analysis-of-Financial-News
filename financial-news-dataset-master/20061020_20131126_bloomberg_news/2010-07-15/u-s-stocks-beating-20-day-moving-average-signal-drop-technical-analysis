             The percentage of U.S. stocks that
closed above their 20-day  moving average  is near a level that
indicates the market may decline, according to Concept Capital.  
 After the close of trading yesterday, the share prices of
71 percent of  S&P 500 companies  exceeded their average price
during the previous 20 days, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A proportion of 80 to 90 percent indicates the market
is overbought, or poised to drop,  Craig Peskin  and  John Kolovos ,
co-heads of technical analysis research at the New York-based
firm wrote in a note yesterday.  
 The proportion of stocks above their 20-day average may hit
80 percent within days if the S&P 500 advances, and the current
level may represent an opportunity to speculate on a decline by
short selling stocks, Peskin said in an interview. Short selling
is the sale of borrowed shares in the hope of profiting by
buying them back at a lower price.  
 “For a lot of people who are looking to short the market
that’s close enough to 80 percent,” Peskin said. “At least
being this close to 80 means we should be more cautious.”  
 The S&P 500 retreated less than 0.1 percent yesterday to
1,095.17 after retail sales declined and the Federal Reserve
trimmed its growth forecast for the year. The S&P 500 had gained
7 percent in a six-day rally.  
 “The market’s already done going up, or the market’s going
to have a little pause here,” Peskin said. “You’re getting
close to a point when stocks are probably stretched.”  
 The S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent to 1,088.96 as of 1:19 p.m.
New York time.  
 Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index. Peskin said he was bearish on the stock market in the
longer term.
