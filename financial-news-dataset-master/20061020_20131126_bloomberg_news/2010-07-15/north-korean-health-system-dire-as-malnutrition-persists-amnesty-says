             North Korea’s health care system is
in a “dire state” where amputations are carried out without
anesthesia,  Amnesty International  said in a report released
today.  
 “The Crumbling State of Health Care in North Korea” is
based on interviews with North Koreans living abroad and health
care workers who described the use of unsterilized needles.
Problems of malnutrition exacerbate challenges for the state-run
system in the face of epidemics, the report said.  
 The country is under a series of United Nations trade
 sanctions  for its nuclear weapons program and is suffering from
worsening food shortages since a botched currency revaluation
last year. North Korea spends less than $1 per person annually
on health care, less than any other country, according to  World
Health Organization  figures cited in the report.  
 “The government’s failure to provide basic education about
using medication is especially worrying as North Korea fights a
tuberculosis epidemic,” said Catherine Barber, Amnesty
International’s Deputy Director for the Asia Pacific.  
 The report also described how patients since the 1990s have
paid doctors for services intended to be free using cigarettes,
alcohol or food.  
 “The North Korean people are in critical need of medical
and food aid,” Barber said. “It is crucial that aid to North
Korea is not used as a political football by donor countries.”
