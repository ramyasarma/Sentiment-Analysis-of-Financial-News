             Blue cheese and peanut wontons?
That’s a dish I never knew I wanted until I tasted it.  
 This genre-busting snack -- Chinese historically view
cheese as an unedifying lump of fat -- sets out the stall of
 Caravan . The establishment’s name suggests a journey or a
recreational vehicle and its menu reads more like a car crash
of cuisines, with all the subtlety of a Dutch soccer tackle.  
 Yet this new bar-eatery in London’s Clerkenwell is
likeable. It’s partly the friendly antipodean service and the
informal ambience. What better than to sit outside on Exmouth
Market in the sunshine and watch the world amble by while
enjoying a bottle of Vinho Verde or an Espresso Martini?  
 It’s also about the food, which mostly comes on small
plates. The chef, New Zealander Miles Kirby, formerly headed
the kitchen at the Providores and Tapa and knows his fusion
fare. If there’s a cheerful irreverence about mixing and
matching cuisines, there’s seriousness about flavor.  
 When I visited, there was a good butternut squash, ginger
and coconut soup, balancing sweetness with a hint of spice.
The goat’s curd, tomato, lentils and a sumac cracker is light
and fresh enough for summer, without being bland. If you’re
going for bigger flavors, there’s salt-and-Sichuan squid with
chili mayonnaise.  
 Shitake Jelly  
 My favorites include the duck-liver pate, served in a
glass and topped with a layer of shitake jelly, with toast on
the side. The meat is well seasoned and the jelly cuts through
the richness. You may love or hate the wontons. I always order
them, even though finer cases and lighter cooking would help.  
 Avocado, olive oil and chili flakes on grain toast (4
pounds or $6.14) is a generous serving and I wouldn’t miss it.  
 The desserts are no less adventurous. Orange water
blancmange, guava sorbet and pistachio is pleasingly light, or
there’s coconut rice, banana caramel and tamarind sorbet if
you’re looking for something a little stickier.  
 The presence of a  Probat  roaster in the basement means
you’re unlikely to find fresher coffee. There’s a private
dining table in the roastery. The wine list isn’t greedy, with
plenty of choice between 20 pounds and 30 pounds. Champagne
starts at 40 pounds and most cocktails are 7.50 pounds.  
 The weekend brunch is particularly popular. The fry-up
costs 8 pounds and it’s easy to imagine passing a lazy day
with crumpets in one hand and a bloody mary in the other.  
 If you want somewhere for a quiet bite, it’s worth noting
that most Caravan customers are youngish habitues of
Clerkenwell, many of whom embrace noise and tobacco with equal
enthusiasm. So you may have to choose between loud music
indoors or trying to bag a seat outside, where you share a
table with the smokers.  
 Even there, the combination of street noise and the
racket from within means you may have trouble hearing yourself
cough as you light up. Now, I’m going to rest my voice.
