             The pound may rise on faster-than-
forecast inflation and lower jobless claims, CMC Markets said.  
 The pound is benefitting from “yesterday’s robust job
figures and ongoing nervousness with above-target inflation,”
Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC in London, wrote
today in an e-mailed note. A breach of $1.5380 will “make
$1.5450 the next focal point,” he wrote.  
 Britain’s currency gained for a third day, rising 0.6
percent to $1.5358 as of 1:48 p.m. in London. The currency
traded as high as $1.5366, the strongest since April 30.
