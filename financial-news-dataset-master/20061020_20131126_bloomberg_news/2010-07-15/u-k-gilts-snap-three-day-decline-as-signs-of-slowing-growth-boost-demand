             U.K. government bonds snapped three
days of losses as equities declined and investors sought the
safety of fixed-income assets amid signs global economic growth
may be easing.  
 The 10-year gilt  yield  dropped from a three-week high after
Chinese economic growth slowed and Federal Reserve officials
said they may need to consider further stimulus measures. U.K.
Business Secretary  Vince Cable  said he believes the Bank of
England will take account of state spending cuts when setting
monetary policy. A sale of inflation-linked securities garnered
the weakest bidding for the bonds in a sale since October 2008.  
 “Whenever we see the risk-off trade, the U.K. benefits in
terms of gilts,” said  Andre de Silva , deputy head of global
fixed-income strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc in London. “If the
Fed is considering extending stimulus, you can’t completely rule
it out in the U.K. too.”  
 The 10-year gilt yield fell two basis points to 3.38
percent as of 4:43 p.m. in London, after earlier reaching 3.43
percent, the highest since June 24. The 4.75 percent security
maturing in March 2020 gained 0.16, or 1.60 pounds per 1,000-
pound ($1,291) face amount, to 111.23.  
 The 10-year gilt yield reached a 14-month low of 3.31
percent on July 1 amid concern Europe’s debt crisis may halt the
global recovery. Economic growth in China slowed to 10.3 percent
in the second quarter from 11.9 percent in January-March, the
statistics bureau reported in Beijing today.  
 Fed Index  
 The Federal Open Market Committee “would need to consider
whether further policy stimulus might become appropriate if the
outlook were to worsen appreciably,” according to the minutes
of their June 22-23 meeting released yesterday in Washington.  
 The New York Fed’s general economic index dropped to 5.1
today, lower than the median forecast of 18 in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
manufacturing index fell to 5.1 percent, the lowest level since
August 2009.  
 Cable, speaking at an event in London yesterday, said the
government had to cut the deficit to avoid an “attack on our
sovereign credibility,” and that “implicitly there is an
understanding that monetary policy will accommodate what we’re
trying to do.”  
 The U.K. Debt Management Office sold 1.2 billion pounds of
1.875 percent inflation-linked securities maturing in 2022.
Demand dropped, with investors submitting 1.76 pounds in bids
for every pound of debt offered, down from a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.49 at the May auction.  
 The government said last week state employees’ pensions
will be linked to the consumer price index of inflation rather
than the retail price index, which U.K. inflation-linked bonds
are based on.  
 The pound was 0.8 percent stronger at $1.5385 after
 JPMorgan Chase & Co.  reported earnings that exceeded analysts’
estimates and a Spanish bond sale eased concern the nation would
struggle to cover debt payments. Sterling was 0.5 percent weaker
at 83.89 pence per euro.
