             Shoprite Holdings Ltd., South
Africa’s largest retailer, said sales for the year ended June
rose 14 percent to about 67.4 billion rand ($8.9 billion) after
it opened more stores.  
 “Growth slowed in the second half of the year,” the Cape
Town-based company said in stock exchange statement today. Sales
grew 10 percent in the second half, compared with 12 percent in
the first. Food inflation slowed to 0.2 percent in the latter
half of the year from 4.2 percent in the first six months.  
 Sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.8 percent.
Shoprite’s South African supermarket unit boosted revenue by 15
percent, while its furniture unit’s sales gained 17 percent.  
 Sales at Shoprite’s 106 stores outside its home market
dropped 2.1 percent in rand terms, reflecting an appreciation of
the local currency, the company said. At constant exchange
rates, revenue outside of South Africa rose 18 percent.  
 Shoprite is scheduled to publish annual earnings on August
25. The  shares  rose 20 cents, or 0.2 percent, to 88.45 rand at
10:45 a.m. in Johannesburg today, giving the company a market
value of 48.1 billion rand.
