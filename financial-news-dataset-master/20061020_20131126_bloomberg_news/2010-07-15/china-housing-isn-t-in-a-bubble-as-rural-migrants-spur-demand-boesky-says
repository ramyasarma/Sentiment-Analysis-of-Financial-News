             China doesn’t have a housing bubble
as there is “genuine” demand from rural residents moving to
cities, according to Marco Polo Pure Asset Management’s Aaron
Boesky in a Bloomberg Television interview.  
 China’s stocks could surpass previous highs before 2013,
driven by valuations that are near historic lows and earnings
growth of about 30 percent over the next three years, he said.
