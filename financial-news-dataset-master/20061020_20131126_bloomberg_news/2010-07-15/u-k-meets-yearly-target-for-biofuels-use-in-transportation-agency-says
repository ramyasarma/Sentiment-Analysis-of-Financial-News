             The U.K. met its annual target for
the use of biofuels in transportation, helping to reduce
greenhouse-gas emissions, the Renewable Fuels Agency said.  
 Almost 1.6 billion liters (422 million gallons) of biofuel
were supplied in the year through April 14, or 3.33 percent of
the U.K.’s road transport fuels, the agency said today in an e-
mailed  statement . That exceeds the 3.25 percent target, it said.  
 With biofuels emitting 51 percent less carbon than petrol
and diesel, their use is equivalent to taking half-million
vehicles off the country’s roads, the agency said. U.K. law
requires the nation to cut its total greenhouse-gas emissions by
34 percent in the three decades through 2020.
