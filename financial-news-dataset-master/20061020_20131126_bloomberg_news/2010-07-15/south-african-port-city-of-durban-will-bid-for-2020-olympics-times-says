             The South African port city of
Durban will bid to host the 2020 Olympics, the Times reported,
citing Mayor Obed Mlaba.  
 Durban has already planned where it will build aquatic and
equestrian centers, an indoor sports arena and the Olympic
village that houses athletes, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said.  
 Cape Town and Johannesburg may also bid for the games, the
newspaper said.
