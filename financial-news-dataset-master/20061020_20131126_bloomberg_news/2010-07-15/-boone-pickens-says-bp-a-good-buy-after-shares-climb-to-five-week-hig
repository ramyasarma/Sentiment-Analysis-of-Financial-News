             T. Boone Pickens , the billionaire
energy investor, said that  BP Plc  is a good investment as the
shares rebound after losing more than half their value following
the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  
 “You’re going to have to stand a little more heat, but I
think they’ll kill the well by mid-August,” Pickens, chairman
of Dallas-based BP Capital LLC, said in an interview with
 Kathleen Hays  on Bloomberg Radio’s “The Hays Advantage” program
yesterday. “They will further damage their image when they
start the investigation, but today BP is good buy.”  
 BP has lost 48 billion pounds ($73 billion) of its market
value since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded in the
Gulf of Mexico on April 20, causing the biggest oil spill in
U.S. history. The company agreed last month to set aside $20
billion for cleanup and litigation costs, and said it will sell
assets, reduce spending and cancel its dividend for three
quarters to raise cash.  
 The  shares  fell 9.35 pence, or 2.3 percent, to 401 pence in
London yesterday after BP suspended tests to determine if it can
halt the leak before efforts to permanently plug it are
completed next month. BP, based in London, reached a five-week
high July 13 of 410.4 pence.  
 The company’s  American depositary receipts  fell 70 cents,
or 1.9 percent, to $36.18 in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday. One receipt represents six ordinary BP
shares.  
 Pickens’s fund held no shares in BP as of the end of March,
according to a regulatory filing. The fund held shares of
 Transocean Ltd. , which leased the Deepwater Horizon rig to BP.
It also owned shares of  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , a partner in
the well, and Halliburton Co., which was contracted to do work
on it.  
 Adding Transocean  
 “We still have the Transocean, I think we added to them,”
Pickens said of the shares.  
 BP said this week that it may be able to stop the leak with
a newly fitted cap while relief wells are completed that will
permanently kill the well. The company said yesterday it delayed
pressure testing of the cap to give scientists more time to
study the process.
