             Nigeria will sell the biggest amount
of bonds in at least four quarters in the three months through
October as it seeks to finance projects amid unstable crude oil
revenue, Afrinvest (West Africa) Ltd. said.  
 The West African nation, Africa’s biggest oil producer,
will offer 315 billion naira ($2.1 billion) of bonds in the
third quarter, according to a schedule published on the website
of the country’s Debt Management Office. That’s the most since
at least the  three months through June  last year, data from the
website show.  
 Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan on April 22 signed a
4.6 trillion-naira ($30.6 billion) budget that marks a jump in
spending from 2009 as the government steps up investment in
infrastructure. The budget is almost 50 percent bigger than the
original spending plans for 2009 and 33 percent up when a
supplementary budget approved in December is included. The plan
envisages a deficit of 1.52 trillion naira and is based on an
average oil price of $67 a barrel.  
 “There was instability in oil prices, which made it
difficult for the government to meet its expected revenue,”
Babatunde Obaniyi, a bond analyst with Lagos-based Afrinvest,
said by phone from Lagos today. “The government is emphasizing
building infrastructure, which requires a lot of funding.” This
year, oil traded as high as $87.15 a barrel on March 3 and as
low as $64.24 on May 20.  
 Auction Dates  
 Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, plans to sell 867.5
billion naira of bonds this year to fund a budget deficit due to
a drop in oil revenue,  Abraham Nwankwo , director-general of the
Debt Management Office, said on Feb. 12.  
 The nation will hold auctions on July 21, Aug. 18 and Sept.
22, the Debt Management Office said. It will sell 35 billion
naira of bonds maturing in three, five and 20 years at each
sale.  
 Demand for Nigeria’s three- and 20-year bonds climbed to
the highest level in three months at a government sale on June
23 in which 80 billion naira of debt was sold, the Debt
Management Office said.
