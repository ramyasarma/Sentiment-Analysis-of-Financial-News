             India’s stocks fell for a second day
on speculation the central bank may raise interest rates to
contain price increases after a report today showed food
inflation accelerated for the first time in three weeks.  
 Housing Development Finance Corp. , the biggest mortgage
lender, slid as its quarterly earnings missed analysts’
forecasts. The shares pared gains yesterday after its quarterly
results were announced toward the end of trading.  State Bank of
India Ltd. , the nation’s biggest lender, dropped 1 percent.  
 “The Reserve Bank is likely to balance growth and
inflation,” said  Vaibhav Sanghavi , a fund manager at
Ambit Capital Ltd. in Mumbai. “We remain bullish on the
long-term India growth story.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 28.70, or 0.2 percent, to 17,909.46. The gauge swung
between gains and losses at least 20 times. The S&P CNX  Nifty 
Index on the National Stock Exchange lost 0.1 percent to
5,378.75. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.1 percent to 2,279.36.  
 The decline in local indexes followed a drop in Asian
stocks after U.S. retail sales declined, Federal Reserve members
cut their growth forecasts for the world’s biggest economy, and
China’s expansion slowed.  
 The Sensex climbed 3 percent in the four trading days
through July 13 after the International Monetary Fund said
India’s economy may expand this year at the fastest pace since
2007.  
 Breather  
 “The markets had a good rally in the past few days,”
Sanghavi said. “It’s time to take a breather.”  
 Housing Development dropped 1.1 percent to 3,044.65 rupees.
The company yesterday reported quarterly net income of 6.95
billion rupees. The average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was 7.53 billion rupees.  
 State Bank declined 1 percent to 2439.85 rupees.  ICICI Bank
Ltd. , the second-biggest lender, fell 1.1 percent to 881.85
rupees.  HDFC Bank Ltd.,  the third-biggest, lost 1.1 percent to
2,062.6 rupees.  
 An  index  measuring wholesale prices of farm products
compiled by the commerce ministry rose 12.81 percent in the week
to July 3 from a year earlier, according to a statement released
in New Delhi today. It gained 12.63 percent the previous week.  
 The Reserve Bank of India, which has increased interest
rates three times since mid-March, is scheduled to announce its
next monetary policy decision on July 27.  
 Tata Steel Ltd. , the largest producer of the alloy, rose
1.4 percent to 512.75 rupees, its highest close since May 18, on
plans to raise as much as 16 billion rupees ($343 million)
selling shares and warrants to its parent as it expands capacity
and seeks new sources of iron ore and coal.  
 Share Sale  
 The company will sell 15 million shares at 594 rupees
apiece to Tata Sons, totaling 8.91 billion rupees, according to
a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange. It will also sell 12
million warrants, fetching as much as 7.13 billion rupees, the
Mumbai-based company said.  
 Religare Enterprises Ltd. , a financial services company,
gained 1.4 percent to 416.35 rupees. Citigroup Inc.’s Indian
unit sold 5 billion rupees of mortgages to Religare
Enterprises’s Finvest unit, Abhijit Sen, chief financial officer
of Citigroup’s South Asia unit, said in an interview today.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  8.04 billion rupees  of Indian
equities on July 13, increasing total investments in stocks this
year to 381.5 billion rupees, according to the nation’s market
regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Hindustan Petroleum Corp.  (HPCL IN) sank 6 percent to 445.6
rupees. The state-owned refiner was cut to “neutral” from
“buy” by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts  Nilesh Banerjee  and
 Nishant Baranwal , who cited the “sharp rally” in government-
owned oil stocks. The analysts maintained their share-price
estimate of 453 rupees for Hindustan Petroleum.

technology and introduce new products. This will boost its
revenue by 1.5 billion per year and result in savings of about
80 million rupees every year, the company said in a statement to
the exchange.
