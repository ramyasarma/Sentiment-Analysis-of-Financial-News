             Turkiye Is Bankasi AS,  Turkey’s
biggest non-government lender, has no immediate plans to buy a
bank in Egypt, Deputy Chief Executive  Aykut Demiray  said.  
 Isbank is looking for opportunities to expand in
neighboring countries and would consider a purchase in Egypt if
conditions are right, Demiray said in an interview in Istanbul
today with the Bloomberg HT television channel.  
 He was commenting on a report in Al Shorouk newspaper today
that Isbank got initial approval from Egypt’s central bank to
buy the state-owned Arab Investment Bank, while its application
to open branches in Egypt was rejected. Isbank set up a
representative office in Cairo in June.  
 Isbank’s shares were unchanged at 5.55 liras at 10:30 a.m.
in Istanbul.
