             China National Nuclear Corp., the
country’s biggest builder of reactors, is seeking to construct a
nuclear plant in Argentina as the company expands overseas.  
 State-run China National Nuclear will place a bid to build
Argentina’s fourth atomic plant, President  Sun Qin  said at a
conference in Shanghai today. He didn’t provide further details.  
 China’s emergence as an exporter of nuclear power equipment
would increase competition for  Areva SA  and General Electric Co.,
who were beaten in December to a $20 billion order in the Middle
East by a group led by Korea Electric Power Corp. Chinese
suppliers may make “a big breakthrough” in overseas expansion
in one to two years, Sun said on March 5.  
 China National Nuclear and China Guangdong Nuclear Power
Group are already in discussions with potential overseas
customers, Sun said then, without elaborating.
