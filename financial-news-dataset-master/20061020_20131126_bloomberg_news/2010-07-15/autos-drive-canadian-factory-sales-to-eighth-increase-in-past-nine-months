             Canadian  factory sales  rose for the
eighth month in nine during May, led by automobiles and food,
and a measure of unsold goods fell to the lowest level in almost
two years.  
 Sales increased 0.4 percent to C$44.8 billion ($43.5
billion), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg predicted growth of 0.5 percent, according
to the median of 18 estimates.  
 Manufacturing has lagged behind recoveries in consumer
spending,  output growth  and job creation after a recession that
ended last year. Slow U.S. demand and a strong Canadian dollar
remain obstacles for factory owners, the Bank of Canada  has
said . The currency has gained 7.9 percent against the U.S.
dollar over the past year, making the country’s goods less
competitive.  
 “Don’t expect it to become a big contributor to economic
activity,” said  Sheryl King , head of Canadian economics and
strategy at Merrill Lynch Canada in Toronto. Manufacturing is in
a “secular decline” with companies curbing production as the
high dollar erodes competitiveness, she said.  
 The Canadian dollar fell 0.9 percent to C$1.0419 per U.S.
dollar at 10:28 a.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0327 yesterday. One
Canadian dollar buys 95.98 U.S. cents.  
 Sales have regained less than half of the decline from the
recession according to Bloomberg figures. Sales  peaked  at C$53.3
billion in July 2008, and then dropped to C$38.5 billion by May
2009 according to Bloomberg figures.  
 Second Half Slowdown  
 On a percentage basis, employment has already recovered its
recession losses and the economy  grew  at the fastest pace in a
decade in the first quarter.  
 Factory sales may slow in the second half of the year as
U.S. demand wanes, said Grant Bishop, an economist at Toronto-
Dominion Bank. Federal Reserve officials pared their economic
growth forecast, according to minutes published yesterday from a
meeting last month.  
 Factory sales rose in nine of 21 categories that make up 49
percent of the country’s total, the report said. Gains in May
were led by transportation equipment and food, the two largest
categories. Transportation rose 3.1 percent to C$7.56 billion on
a 4.6 percent gain in motor vehicles, Statistics Canada said,
while food sales rose 1.5 percent to C$7.09 billion.  
 Excluding cars and parts, sales fell 0.1 percent to C$39.1
billion, the report said.  
 Expansion Plans  
 General Motors Co. said June 1 it will spend C$245 million
at a plant in Ontario to produce six-speed transmissions. The
company had earlier committed another C$235 million for engine
production, and the two projects will support 800 jobs.  
 Statistics Canada also increased its estimate for the April
factory sales gain to 0.4 percent from the earlier 0.2 percent.  
 Inventories declined as sales rose in May, by 0.7 percent
to C$58.5 billion, the report said. That lowered the  ratio  of
inventories to sales, a measure of how long it would take to
deplete stockpiles, to 1.30 in May from 1.32 in April, the
lowest since July 2008.  
 New factory orders rose 2.5 percent to C$45.5 billion,
while unfilled orders rose 1.3 percent to C$53.4 billion.
