             Treasuries slipped as better-than-
expected earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co. boosted U.S. stock
futures, damping bonds’ haven appeal.  
 U.S. two-year note yields earlier approached a record low
before reports today that may show U.S. industrial production
and wholesale prices fell in June.  
 “Earnings are better,” said  Thomas L. di Galoma , head of
U.S. rates trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based
brokerage for institutional investors. “That’s going to be
supportive for stocks and may impact yields on Treasuries a
bit.”  
 The  yield  on the 10-year Treasury note rose 2 basis points
to 3.07 percent at 8:23 a.m. in New York, according to BGCantor
Market Data. The two-year  note  yield increased 2 basis points to
0.62 percent after earlier falling to 0.59 percent.
