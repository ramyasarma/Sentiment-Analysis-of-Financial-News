             Republicans competing for open U.S.
Senate seats in Florida and six other states as a group raised
millions of dollars more than the Democratic contenders in
2010’s second quarter.  
 Marco Rubio , the Republican candidate in Florida, brought
in more than $4.5 million, his  campaign  said. His Democratic
opponent, Representative  Kendrick Meek , raised more than $1
million, according to his  website . The independent candidate,
Governor  Charlie Crist , toted up $1.8 million.  
 Republicans in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire,
Ohio and Pennsylvania also out-raised rivals from April 1
through June 30. A backlash against Democrats, who control
Congress and the White House, may be boosting fundraising for
Republicans such as Rubio, a former state house speaker.  
 “The second-quarter results suggest a classic cycle of
donors deciding this is a good year for Republicans, giving them
money and reinforcing the existing advantage of national
tides,” said  Linda Fowler , a government professor at Dartmouth
College in Hanover, New Hampshire.  
 Another sign of trouble for Democrats showed up in Nevada.
Former Republican state legislator  Sharron Angle  toted up almost
$2.6 million in her bid to unseat Senate Democratic Leader  Harry Reid , including $2.2 million in the last 42 days of the quarter.
Reid brought in more than $2.4 million during the period, his
campaign said.  
 Boxer, Lincoln  
 Other Democratic incumbents fared better in the quarter.
Arkansas Senator  Blanche Lincoln , California Senator  Barbara Boxer  and Colorado Senator  Michael Bennet  brought in more
campaign cash than Republican challengers.  
 The money race in Washington state was closer. Democratic
Senator  Patty Murray  reported raising $1.6 million over the
three-month period, while former Republican gubernatorial
candidate  Dino Rossi  said he  raised  about $1.4 million in a
month after deciding to challenge Murray.  
 All Senate candidates had to postmark their quarterly
reports to the  Federal Election Commission  by yesterday. Not all
of them have released copies of their filings, and many have
only shared total amounts.  
 In Pennsylvania, former Republican Representative  Patrick Toomey  said he raised $3.1 million in the quarter, compared with
almost $2 million for Democratic Representative  Joe Sestak .
Sestak’s campaign said he raised about $1.6 million in June,
buoyed by a May 18 primary win over Senator  Arlen Specter .  
 Ohio Figures  
 Former Ohio Representative  Rob Portman , a Republican,
reported raising almost $2.7 million in the race to succeed
retiring Republican Senator  George Voinovich . The Democratic
candidate, Lieutenant Governor  Lee Fisher , raised more than $1
million, his campaign said.  
 Illinois Republican Representative  Mark Kirk  raised $2.3
million, compared with about $900,000 for state treasurer and
Democrat  Alexi Giannoulias , their campaigns said. The two are
vying for the Senate seat formerly held by President  Barack Obama  and now occupied by retiring Democrat  Roland Burris .  
 “There’s greater political energy on the Republican side
right now, which spills over into donation patterns,” said
 Rogan Kersh , a public policy professor at New York University.  
 Missouri Republican Representative  Roy Blunt  brought in
about $2.2 million, compared with more than $1.5 million for
Missouri Secretary of State  Robin Carnahan , a Democrat,
according to their campaigns. They are seeking a seat held by
retiring Republican  Kit Bond .  
 Indiana Race  
 In Indiana, former Republican Senator  Dan Coats  brought in
more than $1.7 million in the quarter, including a $200,000 loan
from himself. Democratic Representative  Brad Ellsworth  raised
more than $600,000, his campaign said. They are competing to
replace retiring Democratic Senator  Evan Bayh .  
 Republican  Kelly Ayotte , a former state attorney general,
raised $720,007 in New Hampshire as she vies for the seat of
retiring Republican Senator  Judd Gregg , according to a copy of
her FEC filing supplied by the campaign. Representative  Paul Hodes , a Democrat, raised $605,191.  
 “The biggest factor for the elections will be the
economy,” said  Clyde Wilcox , a government professor at
Georgetown University in Washington. “If it improves
substantially by the time of the election, then Democrats will
start raising more money.”  
 Fiorina Loans  
 Boxer, the Democratic incumbent in California, brought in
$4.6 million in the quarter. That compared with more than $3
million for her Republican challenger, former  Hewlett-Packard
Co.  Chief Executive Officer  Carly Fiorina , a Republican.
Fiorina’s total included at least $1.1 million in loans she made
to her campaign.  
 In Arkansas, Lincoln raised almost $2.7 million, compared
with $622,912 for Republican Representative  John Boozman , their
campaigns said.  
 In Colorado, Bennet raised more than $1.2 million, his
campaign said. His challenger in the state’s Aug. 10 primary,
former state House Speaker  Andrew Romanoff , hadn’t reported as
of late yesterday. In the Republican primary contest, former
Lieutenant Governor  Jane Norton  raised more than $900,000 and
Ken Buck, a county prosecutor, took in $420,592.  
 The money race in Kentucky was close. Republican  Rand Paul ,
an ophthalmologist, said he raised more than $1.1 million.
Democrat  Jack Conway , the state attorney general, said he
brought in $1.4 million, including a $400,000 loan from himself
to the campaign. They are vying to replace retiring Republican
 Jim Bunning .
