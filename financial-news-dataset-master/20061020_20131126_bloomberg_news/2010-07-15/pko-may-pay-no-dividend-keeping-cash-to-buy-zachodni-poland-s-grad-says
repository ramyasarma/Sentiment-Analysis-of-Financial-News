             PKO Bank Polski SA, the state-
controlled Polish lender that’s seeking to buy Bank Zachodni WBK
SA from Allied Irish Banks Plc, may pay no dividend from its
2009 profit, Treasury Minister Aleksander Grad said.  
 “All options are open,” including retaining all of last
year’s earnings, Grad told reporters in Warsaw today. “We will
try to construct the dividend motion so that it would allow PKO
to buy Zachodni with its own funds.”
