             Investec Plc  plans to offer bonds
backed by U.K. prime and non-conforming mortgages in the South
African investment and private bank’s first public sale of the
notes in Europe since March 2007.  
 The lender intends to issue from 175 million pounds ($267
million) to 250 million pounds of bonds,  Richard Downer, 
Investec’s London-based head of banking and institutions group
said in an interview. The transaction may be ready by year end,
he said.  
 The bank’s Kensington Mortgage Company unit said it
resumed lending to prime clients in  November , more than a year
after suspending its home loans business because of market
turmoil. Kensington held 1.78 billion pounds of mortgages at the
end of March, of which 626 million pounds were “near prime,”
according to the company’s  annual report .  
 “The pool will be a mixture of older production and newly
originated prime mortgages,” said Downer. “We have moved our
lending criteria from non-conforming to the prime mortgage
market.”  
 Non-conforming mortgages are loans that don’t meet standard
bank-lending criteria due to lack of credit history or less
detailed proof of income.  
 Investors demand an average 155 basis points more than
interbank rates to buy five-year senior bonds backed by U.K.
prime mortgages, compared with as much as 425 basis points in
January 2009, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Senior three-
year U.K. non-conforming mortgage-backed securities are trading
at a spread of 380 basis points, down from as high as 1,200
basis points in June 2009. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  
 Return to Market  
 The decline in spreads is allowing lenders to return to the
securitization market. Banks including London-based Lloyds
Banking Group Plc and the U.K. unit of Spain’s Banco Santander
SA have sold a total 39 billion euros ($50 billion) of asset-
backed securities so far this year, compared with about 9
billion euros in 2009, JPMorgan data show.  
 Kensington sold 800 million pounds of bonds backed by U.K.
mortgages in March 2007, according to Bloomberg data. Investec’s
Australian unit priced A$240.7 million of asset-backed
securities in May, a person familiar with the transaction said
at the time.
