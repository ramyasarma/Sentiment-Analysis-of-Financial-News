             Rosatom Corp., Russia’s nuclear
power company, may begin work with Siemens AG in atomic energy
fields where the German company’s former partner, Areva SA,
isn’t competing, Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko told
reporters in Yekaterinburg today.  
 Rosatom and Siemens are “fully resolute” to partner in
building nuclear power plants and are waiting for Siemens’ court
action with Areva to resolve, Shmatko said.
