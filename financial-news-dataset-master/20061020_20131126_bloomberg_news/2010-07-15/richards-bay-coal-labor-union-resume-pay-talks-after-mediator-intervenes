             Richards Bay Coal Terminal, Africa’s
largest coal-export facility, and the South African Trade and
Allied Workers’ Union resumed talks today to resolve a pay
dispute after a mediator intervened, a union official said.  
 The state-funded Council for Conciliation, Mediation and
Arbitration “has tried to assist,” and called the parties to a
meeting today, Sipho Ntshakala said by phone from Richards Bay.  
 About 400 of RBCT’s staff are on strike at the terminal for
a fourth day, Ntshakala said, adding that they’re demanding a 12
percent increase in wages. The facility employs “just over 500
people,” according to its  website .  
 The east coast terminal, owned by coal producers including
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , Anglo American Plc,  Xstrata Plc  and Sasol
Ltd., supplies coal for power plants in Europe.  
 Richards Bay spokeswoman Zama Luthuli wasn’t immediately
available on her land or mobile phone lines when Bloomberg News
called. No one at the Johannesburg or Richards Bay offices of
the CCMA was available for comment.  
 Richards Bay said yesterday the “minority” of its staff
are on strike and operations were unaffected.
