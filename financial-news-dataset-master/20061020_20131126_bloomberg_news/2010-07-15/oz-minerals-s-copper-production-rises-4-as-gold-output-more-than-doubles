             OZ Minerals Ltd ., which operates the
A$1.2 billion ($1.06 billion) Prominent Hill mine in Australia,
said second-quarter copper output rose 4 percent and boosted its
full-year gold production forecast.  
 Copper output was 28,236 metric tons, Melbourne-based OZ
Minerals said today in a statement. That compares with 27,159
tons in the year earlier period. Gold output more than doubled.  
 OZ Minerals yesterday approved a A$135 million underground
development at Prominent Hill after the Australian government
excluded base metals mines from its new profits tax. The price
of copper in London averaged 51 percent higher than the same
period a year ago, it said.  
 “The medium-term outlook for the copper market is very
good,” Chief Executive Officer  Terry Burgess  said on a
conference call. “The concentrates market continues to be very
tight.”  
 OZ Minerals, which this month acquired a 19 percent stake
in  Sandfire Resources NL  for A$100 million, rose 1.4 percent to
A$1.13 at the 4:10 p.m. Sydney time close on the Australian
stock exchange. The stock has dropped 4.2 percent this year.  
 Gold production was 49,249 ounces, the company said. That
compares with last year’s 18,351 ounces. The company raised its
full-year gold output forecast to between 140,000 ounces and
150,000 ounces, from 110,000 to 120,000 ounces.  
 Production of copper during the second half of the year
will be lower than the first six months because of expected
lower copper grades, the company said. It reiterated its full-
year output forecast of 100,000 tons to 110,000 tons.
