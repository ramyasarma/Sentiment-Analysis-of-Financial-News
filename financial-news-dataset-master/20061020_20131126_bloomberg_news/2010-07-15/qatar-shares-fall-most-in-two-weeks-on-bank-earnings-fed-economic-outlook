             Qatar shares declined the most in
almost two weeks after Qatar Islamic Bank said second-quarter
earnings fell 35 percent and the U.S. Federal Reserve trimmed
the growth forecast for the world’s biggest economy.  
 Qatar’s  QE Index  slipped 0.9 percent to 6,956.3, the most
since July 4, at 11:40 a.m. in Doha, trimming its gain for the
week to 0.6 percent.  Qatar Islamic Bank , the Gulf state’s
biggest lender complying with Muslim banking rules, retreated
3.5 percent as earnings fell short of analyst estimates.
 Commercial Bank of Qatar,  the country’s second biggest bank,
slid the most since July 1. The  Bloomberg GCC 200  Index lost 0.2
percent.  
 “On the downside, Gulf markets are highly correlated with
global markets,” said  Vyas Jayabhanu , head of Al Dhafra
Financial Brokerage LLC in Abu Dhabi. “Investors are waiting
for more second-quarter earnings.”  
 Companies from Gulf Arab nations started releasing earnings
this month.  Qatar Insurance Co.  is expected to announce results
today and Masraf Al Rayan, a Qatar based bank, will release
earnings next week.  
 Federal Reserve officials at their June 22-23 policy
meeting saw no need to boost stimulus to the economy, while
trimming their forecasts for growth, meeting minutes released
yesterday showed. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  fell 0.9 percent,
the most in more than a week, and the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index 
dropped as much as 0.6 percent.  
 Qatar Islamic Bank  slumped the most since May 25 to 72.4
riyals. Net income slid to 301 million riyals ($83 million) from
462.4 million riyals a year earlier, according to Bloomberg News
calculations based on an e-mailed release of first-half net
income of 601 million riyals. The mean estimate of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a second-quarter profit
of 353 million riyals.  
 Commercial Bank of Qatar declined 2.7 percent to 66.2
riyals, the lowest intraday level since July 8.  
 Abu Dhabi’s  gauge  and Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  were little
changed. The  Kuwait SE Price Index  lost 0.4 percent while
Bahrain’s  gauge  gained 0.2 percent. Dubai’s  DFM General Index 
advanced 0.9 percent, bringing its increase for the week to 1.2
percent. Saudi Arabia’s market was closed for the weekend.
