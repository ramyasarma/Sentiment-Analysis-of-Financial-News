             Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd. , the
target of a takeover by South Africa’s Aspen Pharmacare Holdings
Ltd., cut its full-year profit forecast by as much as 46 percent,
citing competition in the generic-drug business.  
 Net income will probably reach A$43 million ($37.8 million)
to A$47 million in the year ending Jan. 31, 2011, Sigma said
today. The Melbourne-based company said June 21 it may miss its
earnings target, after forecasting in March that full-year
profit would be similar to the A$80.1 million reported for 2009.  
 Sigma  fell 2.1 percent to close at 47.5 Australian cents in
Australian trading, extending this year’s decline to 52 percent.
The company, Australia’s largest drug distributor, said it’s
unsure about the short-term impact of changes to government
regulations.  
 “Performance in the generics division remains below
budget,” Sigma said in a statement. “Competition in this area
remains intense. Sigma believes this is primarily due to
suppliers seeking market share in anticipation of substantial
future growth in the generics market.”  
 Aspen , Africa’s biggest drugmaker, reduced its bid on July
7 to 55 Australian cents a share, or about A$648 million in
total, after examining Sigma’s books. The Australian company
said July 12 it wants a better bid from Aspen, which previously
offered 60 cents a share.
