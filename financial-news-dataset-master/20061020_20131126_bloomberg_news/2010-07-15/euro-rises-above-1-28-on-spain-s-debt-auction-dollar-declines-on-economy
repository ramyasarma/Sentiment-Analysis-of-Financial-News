             The dollar dropped to a two-month
low against the euro and fell versus the yen as reports showed
manufacturing in the New York and Philadelphia regions expanded
at the slowest pace this year and U.S. producer prices fell.  
 The euro advanced above $1.28 for the first time since May
as demand at Spain’s government bond sale eased concern that
nations in the currency region won’t be able to fund their
deficits. Australia’s dollar slid against the yen as China
reported slower economic growth.  
 “It’s not terribly surprising to see the U.S. dollar sold
off,” said  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at
National Bank of Canada in Toronto. “The economics have been
softer. There’s some sovereign demand for the euro.”  
 The euro gained 1 percent to $1.2874 at 10:25 a.m. in New
York, from $1.2743 yesterday, after touching $1.2893, the
highest level since May 10. The euro dropped 0.2 percent to
112.45 yen, from 112.66. The dollar declined 1.2 percent to
87.35 yen, from 88.41.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index and the Philadelphia Fed’s gauge fell in July to 5.1,
reflecting the slowest pace of manufacturing expansion this
year. Readings greater than zero signal growth.  
 U.S. producer prices dropped 0.5 percent in June after a
0.3 percent decrease in the previous month, the Labor Department
reported. The median forecast of 73 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 0.1 percent drop.  
 Spain’s Debt Sale  
 The euro rose earlier against the dollar after Spain’s debt
sale drew stronger demand. The nation sold 3 billion euros ($3.8
billion) of 15-year bonds, attracting bids worth 2.57 times the
securities offered, compared with 1.79 the last time they were
sold in April. Spain, which is cutting spending, has the third-
largest deficit in the euro region.  
 “We are beginning to see good news from Europe and bad
news from the U.S.,” said  Kathy Lien , director of currency
research, at the online trader GFT Forex in New York. “The
Spanish bond auction received a very strong amount of demand.
It’s supporting the euro-dollar rally.”  
 Minutes of the Fed’s June 23 meeting released yesterday
showed policy makers trimmed their forecasts for growth and said
risks to the recovery had increased.  
 If the U.S. economic outlook worsened, policy makers would
need to consider whether additional stimulus was appropriate,
according to the minutes.  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co., the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets, posted a 76 percent rise in quarterly profit to $4.8
billion, or $1.09 a share, beating an average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey for adjusted earnings of 71 cents.  
 Goldman Sachs View  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered forecasts for the dollar
against the euro and yen on slowing U.S. growth and “reasonably
solid” European economic data.  
 The euro will rise to $1.35 in six months, compared with a
previous call for $1.15, Goldman Sachs said in a report dated
yesterday. The dollar will trade at 83 yen in six months,
compared with an earlier target of 94 yen, Goldman Sachs said.  
 Australia’s dollar fell on speculation slower growth in
China will reduce demand for commodities. The Aussie declined
2.4 percent to 76.40 yen, from 78.24 yen, and decreased 1.2
percent to 87.47 U.S. cents, from 88.51 cents.  
 China’s  economic expansion  eased to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter and industrial production cooled in June more
than forecast, signaling a deeper second-half slowdown.  
 “Because of its heavy reliance on Chinese economy, any bad
news that comes out of that country hurts sentiment toward
Australia and the Aussie,” said  Toshiya Yamauchi , a senior
foreign-exchange analyst in Tokyo at Ueda Harlow Ltd.
