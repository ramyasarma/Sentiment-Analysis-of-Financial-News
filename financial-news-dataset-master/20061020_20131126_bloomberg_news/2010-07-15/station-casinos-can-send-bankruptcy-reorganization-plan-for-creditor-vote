             Station Casinos Inc. , the biggest
U.S. gambling company in bankruptcy, can send its reorganization
plan to creditors for a vote, a judge ruled.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Gregg Zive  in Reno, Nevada, said
today that the disclosure statement for the company’s plan
contains enough information for creditors to decide whether to
support it.  
 Under Station’s plan to emerge from bankruptcy, the Las
Vegas-based company would be broken into two parts, both of
which would be taken over and reassembled by a partnership led
by company Chairman  Frank Fertitta  and his brother, Vice
Chairman  Lorenzo Fertitta .  
 The company is negotiating with lower-ranking creditors to
win their support before voting begins in the next few days,
company attorney Thomas Kreller told Zive.  
 “It is possible that a deal could come before solicitation
starts,” Kreller said.  
 The creditors must vote on the plan by Aug. 20. Zive will
take that tally into consideration when he decides whether to
approve the plan at a court hearing scheduled to begin Aug. 27.  
 The Fertittas and their partners, including some company
lenders, must still win an Aug. 6 auction for a majority of
Station’s 18 casinos.  
 The case is In re Station Casinos Inc., 09-52477, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Nevada (Reno).
