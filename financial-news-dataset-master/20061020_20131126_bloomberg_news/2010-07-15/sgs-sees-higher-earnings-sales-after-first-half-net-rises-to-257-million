             SGS SA , the world’s biggest goods
inspector, said it expects profit and sales this year to beat
2009’s results after demand for its consumer- and mineral-
testing services increased in the first half.  
 Net income rose to 270 million Swiss francs ($257 million)
from 255 million francs a year earlier, the Geneva-based company
said today in a statement. That missed the 275 million-franc
 median estimate  of four analysts polled by Bloomberg.  
 SGS, which monitors crop quality, certifies wind farms and
checks toys for harmful chemicals, relies on commodity-related
testing for two-fifths of its sales. In March, the company named
 Geraldine Matchett   chief financial officer , replacing Richard
Tobin who held the post since 2004.  
 Revenue increased 1.1 percent to 2.35 billion francs, and
SGS said that it spent 29 million francs in the six-month period
on four acquisitions.  
 Sales from oil and gas services, SGS’s biggest unit, gained
2.5 percent to 480.2 million francs, while revenue at the
consumer testing unit advanced 3.9 percent to 407.3 million
francs. The minerals division posted an increase of 11 percent
in revenue.
