             China is likely to maintain curbs on
the property industry “for a while” to control prices,
according to Fidelity International’s Anthony Bolton.  
 Slowing growth may prompt the government to ease economic
policy and this will provide the catalyst for stocks to resume a
bull market, he said in a Bloomberg Television interview.

                          July 16 (Bloomberg) -- Anthony Bolton, Fidelity International's president of investments, talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li about the outlook for the Chinese economy and the nation's property and stock market. 
     Bolton said yesterday China’s "golden era of exports" is over and a bull market will resume for the country’s stocks this year as domestic consumption drives economic expansion. (Source: Bloomberg)
