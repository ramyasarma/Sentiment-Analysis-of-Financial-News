             Illegal logging in Brazil, Indonesia
and Cameroon shrank as much as 75 percent in 2000-2008, lowering
carbon emissions from tropical forests that have been blamed for
adding to global warming, a study by  Chatham House  said.  
 About 17 million hectares (42 million acres) of rain forest
have been protected and 1.2 billion tons of polluting emissions
avoided over that period, Chatham House, a London-based non-
governmental research organization, said today in a report.  
 Cutting trees illegally in rain forests is one of the
biggest greenhouse-gas contributors after burning fossil fuels
including coal. Earlier this month, the European Union
parliament voted to force companies to ascertain that the timber
sold in the 27-nation EU was harvested legally. The U.S. also
prohibits the import and sale of illegally logged wood.  
 The group of Group of Eight nations in 1998 agreed to
tackle illegal logging and spent “large amounts of time and
money” to try to tackle the problem, the Chatham House report
said.
