             The euro wouldn’t be able to sustain
a rally beyond $1.30 after China reported slower growth in the
second quarter, according to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  
 “We doubt the slowdown story for the second half of the
year will be exclusive to the U.S.,” wrote  Derek Halpenny ,
European head of currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. in London, in a research report today. “It may not be
long before the ECB is under pressure to reverse the recent rise
in short-term yields.”  
 The euro advanced 0.6 percent to $1.2821 at 8:02 a.m. in
New York, from $1.2743 yesterday. It touched $1.2835, the
highest level since May 10.  
 Germany’s two-year government note  yields  increased four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.81 percent, the
highest level since May 4, after investors bought all 3 billion
euros ($3.8 billion) of 15-year debt offered by Spain. The
yields fell earlier after China reported on its cooling economy.  
 China’s economic expansion eased to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter, signaling a deeper second-half slowdown that may
add to risks for the global economy. The gain in gross domestic
product was less than an 11.9 percent increase in January
through March.  
 Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s June 23 meeting released
yesterday showed policy makers trimmed their forecasts for
growth and said risks to the recovery had increased.  
 European Central Bank Executive Board member  Juergen Stark 
said last week the central bank hasn’t embarked on quantitative
easing by purchasing government bonds.  
 “What we’ve done is not quantitative easing,” Stark said at
a conference in Frankfurt on July 9. “We will continue to
sterilize amounts of interventions in the bond market.”
