             Total SA , Europe’s biggest oil
refiner, said margins from processing crude into fuels such as
gasoline and diesel in the second quarter increased 5.8 percent
from the first three months of the year.  
 Margins are indicated at $31.20 a ton in northwest Europe
during the most recent quarter, the Paris-based company said in
a  statement  on its website today. That’s $4.24 a barrel.  
 Refining margins rose as plants in the region were shut for
maintenance amid rising demand for oil-products following an
economic recovery.  
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc halted a high vacuum unit at Pernis,
Europe’s largest refinery, in the Netherlands for about six
weeks of repairs starting in April. Ineos Group Holdings Plc
shut a crude unit at its Lavera facility in France from April 23
for almost two months.  
 Margins in northwest Europe fell to an average of $3.01 a
barrel this quarter to July 8, according to data by  BP Plc  on
July 12. That compares with $3.84 in the second quarter.
