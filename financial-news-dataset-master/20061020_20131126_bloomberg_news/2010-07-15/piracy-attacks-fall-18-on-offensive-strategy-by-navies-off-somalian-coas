             Piracy attacks worldwide declined 18
percent in the first half of the year as a more offensive naval
presence around Somalia lowered the number of incidents.  
 Attacks globally fell to 196 from 240 in the same period
last year, the London-based International Maritime Bureau said
in a report today. Incidents in the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea
and around Somalia fell to 98 from 144.  
 “The actions of the navies in the Gulf of Aden have been
instrumental in bringing down attacks there,” IMB director
 Pottengal Mukundan  said in a statement. Incidents also fell in
the first quarter.  
 The European Union’s naval mission has adopted a “more
offensive approach” to Somali assailants, hunting them down at
sea before they can attack, the force’s commander, Rear Admiral
Jan Thornqvist of the Swedish Navy, said in June. About 20
percent of world trade passes through the Gulf of Aden, a
transit point for ships navigating Egypt’s Suez Canal when
sailing between Asia and Europe, according to the EU.  
 The EU’s Atalanta operation, the first naval mission ever
created by the 27-nation bloc, started operating in December
2008. Thornqvist said in June he has six ships and four patrol
aircraft under his command, with more ships due to arrive in
August.  
 Combined with a North Atlantic Treaty Organization fleet, a
U.S.-led fleet, as well as individual warships from countries
such as Russia, China, India, Japan and Malaysia, there are
about 30 warships engaged in anti-piracy missions off the Horn
of Africa.
