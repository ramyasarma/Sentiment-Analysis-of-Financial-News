             China’s power generation expanded at
the slowest pace in four months in June as economic growth
cooled, damping electricity demand from heavy industries.  
 Power output rose 11.4 percent to 346.7 billion kilowatt-
hours last month compared with a year earlier, data today from
the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics show. That’s the
slowest pace since February’s 7.9 percent expansion.  
 China’s economic growth eased to 10.3 percent in the second
quarter from 11.9 percent in January-March, the bureau said
today, after the government succeeded in tempering credit
expansion, investment spending and property speculation.
Industrial output rose a less-than-estimated 13.7 percent.  
 Power production for the first six months rose 19.3 percent
to 1.97 trillion kilowatt-hours.  
 Demand for electricity from industrial users rose 16
percent in June compared with more than 20 percent in the
previous two months, according to the China Electricity Council,
which compiles monthly data for the government. China’s overall
power consumption increased 14 percent last month, the National
Energy Administration said yesterday.  
 Crude-oil output in the world’s second-biggest energy
consuming nation rose 7.4 percent from a year earlier to 16.9
million metric tons, down from May’s record of 17.15 million
tons, the bureau said. Half-year production rose 5.3 percent to
98.5 million tons.  
 The statistics bureau didn’t give figures for coal
production in today’s release.
