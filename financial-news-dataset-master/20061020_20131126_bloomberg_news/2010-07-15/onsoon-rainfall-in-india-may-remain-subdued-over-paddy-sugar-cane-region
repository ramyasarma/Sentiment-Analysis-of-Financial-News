             India’s monsoon rainfall, the main
source of irrigation for the nation’s 235 million farmers, may
remain subdued over the grain and sugar cane growing regions
during the next three to four days, a weather bureau official
said.  
 The central and northeastern states, the main soybean,
paddy and tea-growing regions may see “enhanced” rainfall
during the next two to three days, Medha Kole, a director at the
India Meteorological Department said in a phone interview.  
 Rainfall in July, the wettest month, may be 98 percent of
the 50-year average as forecast by the agency last month, she
said. Showers this season are 13 percent below average as of
yesterday.
