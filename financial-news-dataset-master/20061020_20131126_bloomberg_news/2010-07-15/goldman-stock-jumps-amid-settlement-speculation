             Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Wall
Street’s most profitable securities firm, climbed more than 4
percent amid speculation it will settle U.S. claims that it
defrauded investors. CNBC reported after the market closed that
the firm reached a settlement.  
 Goldman Sachs  jumped  in New York trading after the
Securities and Exchange Commission said it would make a
“significant announcement” at a 4:45 p.m. news conference.  
 The New York Times reported that the firm will pay $550
million to settle the claims, without admitting wrongdoing. Of
that, Goldman Sachs will pay $300 million in fines and the rest
will be restitution.  
 “If and when a settlement is reached, the pool of
potential investors in Goldman stock will get expanded,”
 Michael Mayo , an analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in New
York, wrote in a note to investors today. “Many that we have
spoken with are prohibited from owning Goldman stock when there
is a threat of criminal action.”  
 Goldman Sachs created and sold collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages in 2007, as the U.S.
housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson & Co. helped picked the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles, the SEC said in an April 16 lawsuit.
Billionaire  John Paulson ’s firm earned $1 billion on the trade
and wasn’t accused of wrongdoing.  
 Goldman Sachs has said the allegations were unfounded.  
 The firm’s stock, which closed today at $145.22, has
dropped 21 percent since April 15, the close before the suit was
filed. The S&P 500 Financial Index declined 13 percent in the
same period.  
 Mayo, who predicted last month that a settlement could be
reached as early as July 20, has a “buy” rating on Goldman
Sachs shares with a target stock price of $207.
