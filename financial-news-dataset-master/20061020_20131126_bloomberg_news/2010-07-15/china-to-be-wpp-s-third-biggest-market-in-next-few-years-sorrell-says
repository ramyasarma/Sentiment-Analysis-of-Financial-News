             WPP Plc , the world’s biggest
advertising company, expects the China region will become its
third-largest market in the “next few years,” Chief Executive
Officer  Martin Sorrell  said.  
 The London-based company is “hopeful” of generating $1
billion in revenue from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, Sorrell
said at a conference in Shanghai today, without specifying a
timeframe. WPP counts the U.S., U.K., France and Germany as its
four biggest markets now, he said.  
 Advertisers are increasing investment in China, the world’s
most-populous country and the  third-biggest economy . WPP’s sales
in mainland China increased 7 percent in the first five months
of this year, outpacing growth in Europe, the company said last
month.  
 China’s economic growth slowed to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter from 11.9 percent in the January-March period,
the country’s statistics bureau said today.  
 WPP’s agencies include Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, Young &
Rubicam Inc. and public relations firm Hill & Knowlton.
