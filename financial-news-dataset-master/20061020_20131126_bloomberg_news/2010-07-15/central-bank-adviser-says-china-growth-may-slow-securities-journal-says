             (Corrects currency conversion in second paragraph.)  
 Chinese central bank adviser  Xia Bin 
said the nation’s economic growth may slow by two to three
percentage points in the second half from the first quarter, the
China Securities Journal reported today.  
 China should stick to its 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion)
goal for new lending this year, the newspaper cited Xia as
saying.
