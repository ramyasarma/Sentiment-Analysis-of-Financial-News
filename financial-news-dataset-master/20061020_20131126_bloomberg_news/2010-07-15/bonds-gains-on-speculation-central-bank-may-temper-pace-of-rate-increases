             India’s  10-year bonds  fell for a
third day before sale of 130 billion rupees ($2.8 billion) of
government securities tomorrow, which may squeeze  availability
of cash  at banks.  
 Yields approached their highest in a week after  food
inflation  accelerated for the first time in three weeks. India
will offer bonds maturing in 2017, 2022 and 2027 as part of the
government’s record 4.57 trillion rupees borrowing program.  
 “Liquidity continues to be a concern and more supplies are
scheduled,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “Inflation is also showing
no sign of abating.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.64 percent as of the
5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The price fell 0.04, or 4 paise per 100 rupee
face amount, to 101.11.  
 Yields have climbed eight basis points since the Reserve
Bank of India raised borrowing costs for a third time this year
on July 2 to ease rising  wholesale prices . The next policy
review is scheduled on July 27.  
 An index measuring wholesale prices of farm products
compiled by the commerce ministry rose 12.81 percent in the week
to July 3 from a year earlier. It gained 12.63 percent the
previous week.  
 Policy makers may lift benchmark rates by another quarter-
percentage point this month, said S. Srikumar, a fixed-income
trader at state-owned Corporation Bank.  
 The Reserve Bank on July 2 increased the  reverse-repurchase
rate  to 4 percent from 3.75 percent and the  repurchase rate  to
5.5 percent from 5.25 percent.  
 One-year interest-rate swaps in India, derivative contracts
used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs, increased.
The fixed payment made to receive a floating rate rose eight
basis point to 5.74 percent.
