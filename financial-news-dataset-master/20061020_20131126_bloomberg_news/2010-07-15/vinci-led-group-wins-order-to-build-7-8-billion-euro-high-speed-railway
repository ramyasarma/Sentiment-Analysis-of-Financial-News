             Vinci SA , the world’s biggest
construction company, won a contract to build and maintain a
7.8-billion euro ($10.1 billion) high-speed rail link between
Tours and Bordeaux in southern France.  
 The 340-kilometer (211-mile) stretch of track is the
biggest railway project in Europe, said Reseau Ferre de France,
the rail-network operator that awarded the contract, in a
 statement  on its website today.  
 Vinci and financial partners Caisse des Depots and AXA SA
were picked from among three groups that also included Bouygues
SA and Eiffage SA in a second round of bidding, RFF said. The
works are scheduled to start at the end of 2011, the rail
operator said.  
 The new track will reduce travel time by train between
Paris and Bordeaux by an hour to 2 hours and 5 minutes from the
end of 2016, according to RFF.  
 Vinci and RFF will update contractual documentation and aim
to complete the concession contract in the autumn of this year,
the rail-network operator said, without providing more details.
The construction project will create 60,000 direct and indirect
full-time jobs for the duration of the work.
