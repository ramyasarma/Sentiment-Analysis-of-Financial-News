             Irish  house prices  dropped in
August, extending a property slump that has dragged prices to
the lowest in more than five years.  
 Prices fell 1.5 percent from the previous month and were
down 13 percent from a year earlier, Dublin-based  Irish Life &
Permanent (IPM)  said in a monthly report today. The annual drop is the
biggest since the index began in 1996.  
 House prices have fallen in every month since May 2007 and
are now almost 25 percent below their peak in the early part of
that year. With rising  unemployment  and tighter lending criteria
sapping property demand, the current available supply of homes
is enough to meet demand for the next four years, DKM Economic
Research said in a separate  report  today.  
 “The rate of decline has been more dramatic during the
summer due to low activity in the market and no confidence in
any recovery this side of 2010,” Niall O’Grady, business
strategy manager at Irish Life, said in a statement.  
 The average price of a house in Ireland in August was
235,260 euros ($344,914), down from a peak of 311,078 euros.
That’s the lowest price since January 2004.  
 In Dublin, the Irish capital, prices have fallen 18 percent
in the past year to an average of 306,795 euros.
