The Australian Navy has intercepted
a boat suspected of carrying refugees off Ashmore and Cartier
Islands in the Indian Ocean, according to a government
statement.  The  HMAS Maitland , a patrol craft based in the northern
port city of Darwin intercepted the “irregular entry vessel”
northeast of the Ashmore Islands early today, Minister for Home
Affairs and Justice  Brendan O’Connor  said in a statement. The
islands are about 850 kilometers (530 miles) east of Darwin.  The boat carried 57 passengers and three crew, O’Connor
said.  The group will be transferred to Christmas Island where the
people will go through security, identity and health checks,
according to the statement.  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  is under pressure to toughen
Australia’s policy for dealing with human trafficking. The
number of asylum seekers who have arrived by boat to Australia
has grown to 6,410 this year from 2,726 in 2009. The largest
number hailed from Afghanistan, followed by Iran, Iraq and Sri
Lanka, immigration figures show.  About 48 people died after a boat with 90 Iraqi, Iranian
and Kurdish suspected asylum seekers sank Dec. 15 in heavy seas
close to Christmas Island.  To contact the reporter on this story:
