Russia has expanded the list of
investment banks that will advise it on its planned $59 billion
state asset sale program over the next five years.  The government had previously selected 10 banks, including
Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG, Renaissance Capital and
VTB Capital in October for its asset sales starting next year.
It added 13 more lenders to the list, according to a  Dec. 20
decree  posted on its website late yesterday.  Moscow-based  OAO Sberbank , the country’s biggest lender,
Alfa Bank, the largest private lender, and Troika Dialog,
Russia’s oldest investment bank, are among those added along
with BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.
and UBS AG, according to the decree.  Russia plans to sell as much as 15 percent of  OAO Rosneft ,
its biggest oil producer, and stakes in its two biggest banks,
Sberbank and  VTB Group , as the government seeks to raise 1.8
trillion rubles ($59 billion) in asset sales over five years to
help balance the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
