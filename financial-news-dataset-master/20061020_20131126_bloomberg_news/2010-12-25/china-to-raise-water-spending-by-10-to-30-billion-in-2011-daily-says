China will increase spending on
water conservation projects by 10 percent to 200 billion yuan
($30 billion) next year to aid grain production and prevent
droughts and flooding, the China Daily reported today, citing
unidentified sources. A 10 percent levy on income earned from
the leasing of land will help fund the investment, Chen Lei,
minister for water resources, was quoted as telling a meeting
