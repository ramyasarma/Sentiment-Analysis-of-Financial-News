Asian currencies rose this week, led
by Malaysia’s ringgit and Singapore’s dollar, on optimism the
global recovery is intact after the U.S. economy grew more than
estimated in the third quarter.  The world’s biggest economy grew at a 2.6 percent annual
rate, more than the 2.5 percent reported earlier, the Commerce
Department said on Dec. 22. India’s gross domestic product will
increase 8.5 percent in the year ending March, the fastest pace
since 2008, the nation’s central bank said last week.  “Some players are positioning themselves for the next
year,” said  Mirza Baig , a Singapore-based currency strategist
at Deutsche Bank AG, the world’s largest foreign-exchange trader.
“Generally, everybody’s theme is that Asian currencies will do
well next year.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index gained 0.5 percent
this week, the most since the five-day period ended Dec. 3, to
115.14 in Hong Kong. The ringgit rose 1.2 percent to 3.0930 per
dollar, the Singapore dollar appreciated 0.8 percent to S$1.3004
and India’s rupee advanced 0.5 percent to 45.115, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The ringgit climbed for a fourth successive day on optimism
Malaysia’s growth outlook will spur global funds to add to
holdings of local assets. The nation’s economy will expand 6.7
percent this year, the most since 2004, and 5.3 percent in 2011,
the International Monetary Fund forecast on Oct. 6.  Factory Output  “People are talking about how good this year has been and
how well the economy is going to do next year,” said  Mohd Zaki Talib , a currency trader at RHB Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.  Singapore’s dollar traded at its strongest level since Dec.
15 after data yesterday showed factory output rose at the
fastest pace in six months. Manufacturing, which accounts for
about a quarter of the economy, climbed 39.8 percent in November
from a year earlier, after a revised 29.8 percent increase in
October, the Economic Development Board said.  China’s yuan advanced 0.4 percent this week to 6.6270 per
dollar. The premium to buy the currency outside China
disappeared after Hong Kong’s central bank said it will set up a
fund to ensure supply of the currency for cross-border trade
settlement. The premium reached 2.6 percent on Oct. 19,
reflecting a shortage of the yuan since offshore trading began
in July.  Hong Kong banks will be allowed to tap the 20 billion yuan
($3 billion) fund from next month should the city’s yuan-
clearing bank run out of funds set under a quarterly quota.  Elsewhere this week, the Philippine peso rose 0.4 percent
to 44.02 per dollar and South Korea’s won gained 0.2 percent to
1,150.75. Thailand’s baht dropped 0.2 percent to 30.17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
