Six persons were injured when a bomb
exploded during a Christmas mass in church in military camp in
southern Philippines today, the military said.  A so-called improvised explosive device planted on or near
the roof of the church in Camp Asturias, Jolo, Sulu island,
detonated at around 7 a.m., Lieutenant Colonel Randolph
Cabangbang, a military spokesman, said in a mobile phone text
message. Parts of the roof and ceiling were destroyed, causing
the injuries, he said. Authorities are still investigating the
incident.  Sulu is a stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group
while southern Philippines is home to the nation’s Muslim
separatist movement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
