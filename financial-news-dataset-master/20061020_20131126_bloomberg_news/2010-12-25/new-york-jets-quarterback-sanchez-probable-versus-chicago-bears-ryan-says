Mark Sanchez , recovering from a
shoulder injury, has been given a better than 90 percent chance
of playing quarterback when the New York Jets meet the Chicago
Bears tomorrow, coach  Rex Ryan  said.  After watching Sanchez throw during practice yesterday,
Ryan said the trainers “really felt good” about the
quarterback.  “We think he’s going to be right around 100 percent for
the game,” Ryan said during a news conference. “That’s where
we’re hoping he’s at.”  Sanchez, 24, injured his right shoulder in the first
quarter of the Jets’ 22-17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on
Dec. 19. He stayed in the game with pain in his shoulder and has
been limited in practice for the past few days.  Sanchez has started 32 of the Jets’ 33 games since being
selected with the fifth pick in the 2009 draft. The former
University of Southern California quarterback has completed 54
percent of his passes this season for 3,022 yards and 16
touchdowns. He has thrown 12 interceptions, all in the past nine
games.  The Jets (10-4) can clinch a playoff spot with a win over
the Bears (10-4) or a victory against the Buffalo Bills (4-10)
on Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
