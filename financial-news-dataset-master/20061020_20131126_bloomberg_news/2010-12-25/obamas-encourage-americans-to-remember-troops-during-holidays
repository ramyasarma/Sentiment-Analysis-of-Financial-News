President  Barack Obama  and his wife
Michelle encouraged Americans to take time during the holidays
to remember the service of Americans in the military.  U.S. troops are “the finest fighting force in the history
of the world,” the president said in his weekly address on the
radio and Internet.  “America’s brave servicemen and women represent a small
fraction of our population,” he said. “But they and the
families who await their safe return carry far more than their
fair share of the burden.”  In the Republican address, U.S. Representative  Joe Pitts  of
Pennsylvania also urged Americans to keep members of the armed
forces in their thoughts and prayers.  “To those wearing the uniform in Iraq, Afghanistan and
around the world at this hour, know that we are behind you and
we join your loved ones in praying for your safe return home,”
he said.  The Obamas encouraged Americans to look for ways to help
the families of troops stationed abroad.  “When our men and women in uniform answer the call to
serve, their families serve, too,”  Michelle Obama  said. “Their
sacrifice should also be our own. Even heroes can use a hand,
especially during the holidays.”  The first family is vacationing during the holidays in
Hawaii, where the president grew up. As they did last year on
Christmas Day, the president and the first lady met with troops
and their families in a dining hall at a nearby Marine Corps
base.  To contact the reporter on this story:
