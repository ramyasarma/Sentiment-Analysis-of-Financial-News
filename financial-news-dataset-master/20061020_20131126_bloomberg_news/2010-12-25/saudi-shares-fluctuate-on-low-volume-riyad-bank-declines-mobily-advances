Saudi Arabian shares were little
changed on the first day of the week as international markets
started extended holidays and investors prepare for the release
of fourth-quarter results in the kingdom.  The  Tadawul All Share Index  swung between gains and losses
during the day’s trading, ending down less than 0.1 percent at
the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh to 6609.14, the lowest since Dec.
21. Banks, led by  Samba Financial Group , Saudi Arabia’s second-
largest lender by market value, drove declining stocks, while
petrochemicals led by  Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co. , a unit of
Saudi Basic Industries Corp., the world’s largest petrochemicals
maker, paced gaining shares. The 146-company gauge has climbed 8
percent this year.  “The market is flat on extended holidays and light trading
in international markets until the new year,”  Asim Bukhtiar , an
equity analyst at Riyad Capital, said in Riyadh. “Holiday
shopping has encouraged an optimistic outlook for 2011.”  European  and U.S. stocks rose for a fourth week. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index climbed 1.6 percent, extending this year’s
rally to 11 percent. The  S&P 500  rose 1 percent, topping its
close of 1,251.70 on Sept. 12, 2008, the last trading session
before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed the world’s biggest
bankruptcy.  Brent crude oil for February settlement gained 2.3 percent
this past week and 20 percent this year, settling at $93.77 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
yesterday. Saudi Arabia holds one-fifth of the world’s proven
oil reserves.  Samba  declined 0.8 percent, the most since Dec. 20, to 59.5
riyals.  Riyad Bank , the kingdom’s third-largest lender, lost 1.1
percent to 26.4 riyals.  Sabic  retreated 0.2 percent, the most
since Dec. 22, to 105.25 riyals. Safco rose 1.6 percent to
160.25 riyals, the highest since Oct. 15, 2008.  Etihad Etisalat
Co. , Saudi Arabia’s second-largest telecommunications operator,
known as Mobily, gained 0.9 percent to 55 riyals.  “Investors are gearing up for the new year and fourth-
quarter results,” said  Fuad Aghabi , investment director at
Ajeej Capital in Riyadh.  Saudi Arabia’s index is the only Gulf Arab index tracked by
Bloomberg that trades on Saturday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
