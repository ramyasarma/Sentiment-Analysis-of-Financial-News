Officials in the Dutch port city of
Rotterdam yesterday arrested 12 men from Somalia suspected of
planning a terrorist attack in the Netherlands, the public
prosecutor said in an e-mailed statement today.   The arrests took place after the Dutch secret service had
concrete evidence of terrorist plans, the statement said.
Officials have searched four appartments, two hotel rooms and a
store for making inexpensive international phone calls and they
had not found any weapons or explosives, according to the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
