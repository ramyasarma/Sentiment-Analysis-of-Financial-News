A leader of the armed wing of Hamas
warned Israel of a possible escalation in violence after its air
force struck targets in the Gaza Strip late last night, in
response to a rise in rocket and mortar attacks from the
Palestinian enclave into southern Israel.  If Israel “wants to test our responses, it will be faced
by a harsh response,” Hamas militant leader Abu Obeida told
reporters in Gaza today. “The current attempts of the enemy to
escalate won’t be faced by silence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
