Saudi Arabian forces shot and killed
a man dressed in woman’s clothes yesterday at a security
checkpoint in Wadi al-Dawasser province south of the kingdom’s
capital Riyadh, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.  The disguised man stepped from the car and shot at the
police, the Riyadh-based  news service  reported, citing an
unidentified official at the Interior Ministry. They arrested
another passenger in the car and none of the police were
injured, it said.  Suspected militants have worn abayas, black robes that
cover a women’s entire body, and headscarves to evade police
detection in the kingdom. In October 2009, authorities shot dead
two suspected al-Qaeda terrorists, who had vests packed with
explosives underneath women’s clothes, according to an Interior
Ministry statement.  Saudi security forces detained 149 people suspected of
links with al-Qaeda over the past eight months, Interior
Ministry spokesman Major General Mansour al-Turki said in
November. The arrests foiled about 10 planned attacks on targets
including government and military sites, officials and media
personalities.  The ministry has started an investigation into yesterday’s
attack in Wadi al-Dawasser, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
