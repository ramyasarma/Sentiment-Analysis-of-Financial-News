             Gemina SpA (GEM) 's Aeroporti di Roma SpA
unit, which manages  Rome 's two airports, posted a first-half
loss of 4.6 million euros ($7.1 million) as increased costs
offset higher passenger traffic.  
 The company, which manages Rome's Fiumicino and Ciampino
airports, boosted revenue by 2.4 percent to 269.7 million euros,
helped by a 7.2 percent increase in passenger traffic, according
to a statement distributed through the Italian exchange today.
The unit reported a profit of 5.4 million euros a year earlier.  
 Costs rose more than revenue as Aeroporti di Roma invested
in higher capacity and improved services, the Rome-based company
said. The company also was hurt by the absence of an increase in
airport fees by regulators, Aeoroporti di Roma said.  
 Italian airport managers have had their tariffs frozen for
about eight years. Alitalia SpA,  Italy 's biggest airline,
increased flights at its Fiumicino hub in March in an effort to
stem mounting losses.
