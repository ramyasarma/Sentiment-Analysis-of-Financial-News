General Dynamics Corp. , the maker of
Abrams tanks and Gulfstream business jets, forecast higher full-
year earnings and said third-quarter profit rose 14 percent on
aerospace and computer-systems sales.  Net income increased to $650 million, or $1.70 a share,
from $572 million, or $1.47, a year earlier, the Falls Church,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
 estimated  $1.65 on average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 3.8 percent to $8.01 billion.  Chief Executive Officer  Jay Johnson  is counting on exports
of combat vehicles and growth at Gulfstream to bolster earnings
as defense contractors face a 2012 Pentagon budget that grows no
more than the rate of inflation.  Information technology revenue advanced 7.9 percent to
$2.95 billion, topping the company’s three other segments.
Aerospace sales rose 15 percent to $1.29 billion.  Profit in 2010 will be as much as $6.75 a share, the
company said. It had previously forecast earnings of at most
$6.65. Analysts had projected $6.67, the average of 22 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  General Dynamics  rose  $1.33, or 2.1 percent, to $65.42 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have declined 4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
