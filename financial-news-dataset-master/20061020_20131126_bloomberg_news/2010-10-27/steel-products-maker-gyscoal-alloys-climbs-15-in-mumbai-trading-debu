Gyscoal Alloys Ltd. , an Indian maker
of stainless steel products, climbed 15 percent in its trading
debut in Mumbai after demand exceeded the shares on sale in its
initial public offer by 8.5 times.  The stock  rose  to 81.65 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai after climbing as much as 58.7 percent to 112.7 rupees in
intra-day trading. The Ahmedabad-based company raised 547
million rupees ($12 million) selling 7.7 million shares at 71
rupees each in an IPO earlier this month.  Gyscoal, which manufactures steel angels and products for
construction, will use proceeds from the sale to enhance its
steel melting capacity to 118,000 metric tons a year from 18,000
tons, according to the company’s offer document.  It posted a profit of 49.2 million rupees on sales of 1.68
billion rupees in the year ended March 31, the share sale
document said.  Indian companies have raised about 280 billion rupees ($6.3
billion) from 34 initial public offers in the year that began
April, exceeding the amount raised last financial year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
