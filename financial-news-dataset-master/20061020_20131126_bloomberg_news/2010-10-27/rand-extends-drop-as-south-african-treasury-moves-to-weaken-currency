The rand extended a decline against
the dollar after South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan
pledged to use extra funds to finance foreign-currency purchases
to weaken the currency.  The rand traded at 7.0484 per dollar as of 2:06 p.m. in
Johannesburg from around 7.0405 before Gordhan started his
medium-term budget speech in Cape Town today and 6.9431 late
yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
