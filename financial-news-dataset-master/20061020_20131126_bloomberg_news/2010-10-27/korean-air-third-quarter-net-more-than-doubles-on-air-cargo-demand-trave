Korean Air Lines Co. more than
doubled third-quarter profit to 583.8 billion won ($520 million)
from a year earlier because of higher passenger and cargo
demand, the company said in a regulatory filing today. The
result exceeds the 487.4 billion won average of nine analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg in the past 28 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
