4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest rise since April 2009. Its price is now the highest
since October 2007.  Profit from continuing operations was 44 cents a share,
beating by two cents the average estimate of 12 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, the Itasca, Illinois-based company said
in a statement yesterday.  “We are encouraged by our results and accomplishments this
quarter,” said Chief Executive Officer J.  Patrick Gallagher Jr .
in the statement announcing the company’s earnings. “Posting
slightly positive organic growth in our brokerage segment in
this rate and economic environment is a testament to our sales
culture.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
