Ghana’s producer-price inflation
rate fell to an annual 17 percent in September as manufacturing,
mining and quarrying costs eased.  Inflation slowed from a revised 18 percent in August, Ebo
Duncan, a statistician at the Ghana Statistical Service, told
reporters today in Accra, the capital.  The cost of manufactured goods, which account for 70
percent of the index, rose 5.8 percent in September, from a
revised 6.5 percent the month before, the agency said.  Prices for mining and quarrying, which make up 14 percent
of the index, increased 19 percent from 21 percent in August.  Utility-price inflation accelerated to 71.3 percent in
September from 71.2 percent the previous month, Duncan said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
