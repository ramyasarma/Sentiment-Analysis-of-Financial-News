China may account for a record 
</a>30 percent of global growth over the next decade even as 
the nation’s economy expands at a slower pace, UBS AG said.  That would compare with a 12 percent share between 1998
and 2008, Beijing-based economist  Wang Tao  said in an e-
mailed report dated yesterday, citing the International
Monetary Fund for the historic data.  China’s expansion may cool because of smaller increases
in investment and the labor force and as productivity gains
become harder to secure, Wang said. At the same time, the
increasing heft of the  economy , the world’s second biggest in
the second quarter of this year, means it will account for a
larger share of global expansion, she said.  Lou Jiwei , the chairman of China Investment Corp., the
nation’s sovereign wealth fund, said yesterday that China may
experience a “big drop” in the pace of growth in the next
three to four years as more of the population retires. His
comments were in the prepared remarks of a speech obtained by
Bloomberg News.  For the 15 years through 2009, China’s economy expanded
by an average of 9.9 percent a year, according to government
data.  Wang , head of China economic research at UBS, sees
“trend growth” slowing to an average of 7.8 percent for the
decade from 2011 to 2020.  The world can continue to expand at a pace of between 3
percent and 3.5 percent, “mainly because China and other
emerging market economies, the faster growers, will account
for an increasingly large share of the world economy,” she
said.  UBS projects that China’s gross domestic product will
expand by about 9 percent in 2011 and 2012.  -- Paul Panckhurst . Editors:  Sunil Jagtiani , Paul Panckhurst.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
