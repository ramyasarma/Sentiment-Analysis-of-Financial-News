Carly Fiorina , California’s
Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, will be released from a
hospital today following treatment for an infection, according
to an aide.  Fiorina, 56, who was hospitalized yesterday, will resume
campaigning tomorrow for the Nov. 2 election, Deborah Bowker,
her chief of staff, said in an e-mailed statement.  “Carly has been successfully treated for the infection she
had as a result of reconstructive surgery following her victory
over breast cancer,” Bowker said. “This morning, her doctors
gave her the good news that she will be released from the
hospital today and can resume her busy campaign schedule
tomorrow.”  Fiorina, a former  Hewlett-Packard Co.  chief executive
officer, is challenging Senator  Barbara Boxer , a Democrat, in
one of the races crucial to determining whether Republicans win
control of the Senate next week. Republicans need a net gain of
10 seats to achieve a Senate majority.  Boxer led Fiorina 50 percent to 42 percent among likely
voters surveyed in a University of Southern California/Los
Angeles Times poll released on Oct. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
