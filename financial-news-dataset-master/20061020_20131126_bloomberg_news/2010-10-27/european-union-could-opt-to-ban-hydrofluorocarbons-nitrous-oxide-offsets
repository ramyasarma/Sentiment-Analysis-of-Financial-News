The European Union plans to present
a proposal next month on United Nations emission offsets that
may include a ban on credits related to nitrous oxide and
hydrofluorocarbons for use in the EU as soon as 2013.  The European Commission, the EU regulator, has said that
credits from reducing those industrial gases create significant
windfall profits and may undermine the environmental integrity
of the carbon market. The EU law allows the use of offsets for
compliance in the bloc’s emissions-trading systems as long as
they ensure “real, verifiable, additional and permanent”
emission reductions, said Yvon Slingenberg, emissions market-
unit head at the European Commissions’ climate department.  “The commission is considering restrictions on certain
types of project related to industrial gases HFC-23 and nitrous
oxide,” Slingenberg said in an interview in Brussels today.
“The proposal is in internal consultation. An outright ban is
one of the options, and there are also other options. We need to
come to a final decision within the commission now and then the
proposal will be presented to member states.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
