Travelers Cos. , the insurer added to
the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2009, boosted a note
offering to $1.25 billion as it seeks to tender for subordinated
debt and to take advantage of borrowing costs at about the
lowest on record.  The 10- and 30-year bonds, initially marketed at a size of
$1 billion, may be priced as soon as today, according to a
person familiar with the transaction, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set. The insurer is asking
bondholders’ permission to repay outstanding securities due in
2067 through a debt sale instead of a stock offering.  The company is tapping the U.S. corporate bond market after
Chief Executive Officer  Jay Fishman  told investors last week the
cost of debt versus equity has widened to the most he’s seen in
his career. Companies tendered for $30.5 billion of bonds last
month, the most since April, and may buy another $24.3 billion
this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s a continued onslaught of companies trying to buy
back their debt,” said  Tom Murphy , a money manager who helps
oversee more than $22 billion of investment-grade credit at
Columbia Management in Minneapolis. “In this environment, I
don’t think investors are necessarily going to penalize a
company taking out higher-coupon debt to replace with lower
coupon debt. That’s just smart capital management.”  The weighted average  cost of debt capital  for Travelers is
0.61 percent, while the weighted average cost of equity capital
is 7.27 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘My Career’  The average borrowing cost on investment-grade debt tumbled
to 3.56 percent on Oct. 8, the lowest on record, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Corporate Master index,
which was made available in October 1986. Yesterday, yields were
3.68 percent.  “There has at least in my career never been a period where
the gap between the cost of debt and the cost of equity has been
any wider than it is today,” Fishman said in an Oct. 21
earnings call. “It tells you that the marketplace is at the
moment somewhat upside down.”  Travelers  repurchased  $600 million of common shares in the
third quarter, a “higher amount” than what’s typical for that
period, Chief Financial Officer  Jay Benet  said in the conference
call. The company has bought back 66.8 million common shares for
$3.4 billion this year, Travelers said in an Oct. 21 statement.  A $500 million portion of 10-year notes may yield 120 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and $750 million
of 30-year bonds may pay a spread of 135 basis points, said the
person familiar with the offering. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Terminate Covenant  Travelers is seeking to terminate a covenant that says the
insurer can’t buy back its 6.25 percent hybrid securities due in
2067 for another 37 years unless it uses a sale of stock or
equity-like securities to do so, according to a statement
distributed by Business Wire.  The company is offering holders of its 6.25 percent fixed-
to-floating-rate junior subordinated debt maturing in 2067
$1,050 for bonds with a face value of $1,000, according to the
statement. A “replacement capital covenant” prevents the
company from completing the tender offer with cash from today’s
debt sale unless holders of its 6.75 percent senior notes due
2036 agree to terminate it.  The company is offering owners of those bonds $5 for
securities with a face value of $1,000 to consent to dissolve
the covenant, according to the statement.  Proceeds from today’s offering may be used to repurchase $1
billion of the existing subordinated debt, the insurer said
today in a regulatory filing that didn’t include the sale’s size
or timing.  Travelers sold $500 million of 10-year notes on May 28,
2009, in its most recent bond offering, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
