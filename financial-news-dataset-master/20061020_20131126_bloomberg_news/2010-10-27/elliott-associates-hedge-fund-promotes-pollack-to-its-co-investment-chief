Elliott Associates Corp., the $17
billion hedge-fund firm started by  Paul Singer , promoted Jon
Pollack to co-chief investment officer.  Pollack, who has worked at Elliott for 21 years and runs
its special situations investments globally, will share the post
with Singer, the New York-based firm told clients on Oct. 25.  Pollack, along with  Brian Miller  and  Gordon Singer , Paul
Singer’s son, will become equity partners in Elliott in January,
the firm said. Paul Singer started Elliott in 1977.  Miller, global head of trading, was promoted to the new
position of chief trading officer, while Gordon Singer, who runs
the Elliott’s London office, will be added to the firm’s risk
management committee. He will also run global event arbitrage
strategies, which is investing in companies undergoing
transactions such as mergers or spinoffs.  Scott Tagliarino , a spokesman for Elliott, declined to
comment on the promotions, which were reported yesterday by AR
magazine.  Elliott also said  Steve Kasoff  and  Terry Kassel  will be
added to the firm’s management committee in January. Kasoff
joined the firm in 2003, while Kassel joined in January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
