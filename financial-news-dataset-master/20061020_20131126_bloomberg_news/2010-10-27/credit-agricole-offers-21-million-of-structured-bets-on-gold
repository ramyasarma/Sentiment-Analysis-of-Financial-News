Credit Agricole SA sold $21.2
million of four-year structured notes that pay a fixed coupon
when the price of gold stays above a preset level.  The notes pay the three-month dollar London interbank
offered  rate  plus 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point,
every quarter the price of gold is above $1,290 an ounce,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Three-month Libor, an
average of rates set daily by banks and used as a borrowing
benchmark, is 0.29 percent.  If gold is below the fixing level, investors receive the
Libor rate only. The notes were sold in a private placement in
Switzerland.  The price of gold has risen 21 percent this year to
$1,329.43 an ounce today in London. The commodity is heading for
a 10th annual gain in the longest winning streak since at least
1920, prompting record investment in gold-backed products
including the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund
backed by bullion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
