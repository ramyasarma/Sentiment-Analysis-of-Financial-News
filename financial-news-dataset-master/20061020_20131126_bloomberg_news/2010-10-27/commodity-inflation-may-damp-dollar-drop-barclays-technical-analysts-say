An “explosive” move higher in
agricultural commodities markets and rising fixed-income yields
show inflation may quicken, potentially stemming the dollar’s
declines, a team of Barclays Plc technical analysts said.  “Markets are signaling an outlook for increasing
inflation,” Barclays analysts led by  Jordan Kotick  in New York
wrote in a research note to clients today. “This is likely to
damp the broader trend of dollar weakness and trigger some
profit taking.”  The dollar appreciated 0.3 percent against the euro to
$1.3816 as of 7:06 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
