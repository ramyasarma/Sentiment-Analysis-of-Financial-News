Google Inc. , the owner of the
world’s largest search engine, apologized for erroneous data
collection for its  Street View  mapping service that is being
probed by an Italian court.  Rome prosecutors opened an investigation into alleged
violations of privacy laws, Ansa newswire reported today.  “The accidental collection of Wi-Fi data from Street View
cars was a mistake, for which we’re sorry and apologize,”
Google said in an e-mailed message today. The company added that
it will “fully cooperate” with authorities.  The  Mountain View, California-based company  is
increasingly colliding with Europe’s data regulators who say it
is neglecting privacy as it introduces features such as Google
Buzz and Street View. Earlier this year,  Google  said it deleted
data mistakenly gathered from Wi-Fi networks in Ireland and was
seeking to do the same in other countries.  In May, German regulators opened an investigation into how
cars Google employed to drive around taking pictures for Street
View ended up with private data from Wi-Fi networks that weren’t
password-protected.  To contact the reporters on this story:
