Silver prices, already outperforming
gold and copper, will extend a rally to a 30-year high,
according to technical analysis by  Matthew Zeman , a trader at
LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.  On the Comex in New York, silver futures remained above the
20-day moving average after slumping 4.8 percent last week. In
the past two days, the metal climbed 3.1 percent to close at
$23.83 an ounce yesterday. On Oct. 14, the commodity reached
$24.95, the highest level since 1980.  “The uptrend in silver still looks good,” Zeman said
yesterday in a telephone interview. “Silver is trading above
all its important moving averages. The dip down to the 20-day
saw buyers immediately come in. That’s very bullish. This is a
setup for silver to continue to $26 by the end of the year.”  Silver has climbed 41 percent this year. Gold is up 22
percent, and copper has gained 16 percent.  Bart Chilton, a member of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, said today at a hearing in Washington that “there
have been fraudulent efforts to persuade and deviously control”
the silver price. A CFTC probe of the market is entering the
third year.  In 2008, silver dropped 24 percent, ending a seven-year
rally. Gold futures are headed for the 10th straight annual gain.  In 1980, silver reached $50.35 as the government probed an
attempt by the Hunt brothers to corner the market.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
