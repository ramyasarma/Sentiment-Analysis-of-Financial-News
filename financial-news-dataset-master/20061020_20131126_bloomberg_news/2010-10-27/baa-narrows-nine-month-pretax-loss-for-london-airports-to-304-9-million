BAA Ltd. , owner of London’s Heathrow
and Stansted airports, said the nine-month loss at operations
serving the U.K. capital narrowed after charges for its pension
deficit and the sale of Gatwick weren’t repeated.  The net loss at BAA’s London Heathrow and Stansted airports
was 158.3 million pounds ($251 million) in the nine months ended
Sept. 30, compared with a loss of 636.3 million pounds a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement. Sales fell 16
percent to 1.54 billion pounds after the company sold Gatwick
airport to New York-based Global Infrastructure Partners.  BAA last year had an exceptional pension cost of 261.7
million pounds and an impairment charge on the sale of Gatwick
of 225 million pounds.  The airport operator, a unit of Spain’s  Ferrovial SA , said
Oct. 11 that Heathrow handled 6.2 million passengers in
September, an increase of 7.6 percent and a record for that
month. Traffic at the airport is increasing as airlines add new
routes and reinstate services removed as demand for air travel
slumped in the wake of the global recession.  BAA sold Gatwick to GIP for 1.5 billion pounds under
pressure from the U.K. Competition Commission, which ordered a
breakup of the business. Stansted and either Glasgow or
Edinburgh airport may also have to be disposed of as part of the
process. The company is selling a terminal in Naples, Italy.  Ferrovial, which bought BAA for 10 billion pounds in 2006,
said Oct. 22 it planned to sell a 10 percent stake in the
company to pay down debt and fund other projects. The Spanish
company currently holds a 55.9 percent stake in the airport
operator.  To contact the reporters on this story:
