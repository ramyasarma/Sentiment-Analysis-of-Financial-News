Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc.  agreed to buy Horizon Wine and Spirits Inc. to expand its
liquor distribution business and enter the Tennessee market.  Berkshire’s McLane Co. unit and its Empire Distributors
Inc. will make the purchase of the Nashville- and Chattanooga-
based firm, the subsidiaries said today in a statement
distributed by Business Wire. Terms weren’t disclosed.  Berkshire is adding alcoholic-beverage sellers to boost
sales at McLane, the food-service provider for convenience shops
and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. locations. Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire announced the purchase of Empire in March. At that
time, Buffett said his firm would consider further acquisitions
in the industry.  Berkshire will provide “full support and resources to
continue Horizon’s leadership in the market and to position
ourselves for further growth in Tennessee and beyond,” David
Kahn, president of Empire, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
