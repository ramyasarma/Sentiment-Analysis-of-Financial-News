Hungarian bonds fell, pushing the
five-year yield to its highest in more than a month, and the
forint weakened for a second day after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
said the country’s deficit-reduction plan is “unsustainable.”  The yield on the local-currency note due in 2015 jumped 13
basis points to 6.886 percent, its highest since Sept. 20, as of
10:35 a.m. in Budapest. The forint dropped as much as 0.6
percent and traded 0.3 percent weaker at 275.24 per euro.  Hungary’s plan to curb its fiscal deficit with new taxes
may hurt the economic recovery, will fail to bring down the
country’s borrowing costs, and won’t improve risk perceptions,
Magdalena Polan, a London-based economist at Goldman Sachs,
wrote in a research report to clients late yesterday.  “Fiscal adjustment based on one-off taxes is ultimately
unsustainable and potentially negative for growth,” Polan
wrote. “From the fundamental perspective, this means that the
government may find it difficult to achieve a lasting reduction
in the risk premium and long-term interest rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
