Sandy Alderson  will be named the New
York Mets’ next general manager, Sports Illustrated reported on
its website.  Alderson, who was the Oakland Athletics’ GM from 1983 to
1997, will be chosen over former Arizona Diamondbacks General
Manager  Josh Byrnes , the other finalist for the job, the website
said, citing unidentified people familiar with the decision.  The official hiring may come as early as Oct. 29, a
scheduled off-day in the World Series, which begins tonight,
SI.com said.  Alderson, 62, built an Athletics team that won three
American League pennants and the 1989 World Series. He has also
worked in the Major League Baseball commissioner’s office and as
chief executive officer of the San Diego Padres.  The Mets relieved  Omar Minaya , 51, of his duties as general
manager on Oct. 4. The team was 506-466 in Minaya’s six-year
tenure. New York went 79-83 this season, finishing in fourth
place in the National League East, 18 games behind the division-
winning Philadelphia Phillies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
