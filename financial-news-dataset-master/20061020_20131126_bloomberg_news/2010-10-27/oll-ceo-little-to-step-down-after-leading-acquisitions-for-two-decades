Toll Holdings Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest freight company, said Chief Executive Officer  Paul Little  will step down after leading  acquisitions  across Asia and
Africa from the post for more than two decades.  Search firm Egon Zehnder has been hired to find a
successor, and the handover is expected to be completed by
January 2012, Melbourne-based Toll said in a statement today.
Little, 62, will join the company’s board “after an appropriate
time,” Chairman  Ray Horsburgh  said in the announcement.  Little, who owns a $235 million stake in Toll, has made
more than 60  acquisitions  in the past decade, expanding in
countries including China, Singapore and South Africa. He has
helmed the company since leading a management buyout of Peko
Wallsend Group’s transportation unit in 1986.  Little transformed Toll in 2006 with the A$6.3 billion
($6.1 billion) acquisition of port operator Patrick Corp.
following an eight-month takeover battle.  The search for a replacement will take about six months and
the company expects to have a short-list or preferred candidate
by July, Little said on a conference call today.  Toll  fell 6.6 percent to A$6.20 at the 4:10 p.m. close of
trading in Sydney, giving it a market value of A$4.4 billion.
Little owns about 5.1 percent of outstanding shares, according
to Bloomberg data. The stock has slumped 29 percent this year,
compared the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index’s 4.6 percent drop.  Toll spun off Asciano Group, Australia’s biggest port
operator in 2007 and airline Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd., acquired
in the Patrick takeover, the following year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
