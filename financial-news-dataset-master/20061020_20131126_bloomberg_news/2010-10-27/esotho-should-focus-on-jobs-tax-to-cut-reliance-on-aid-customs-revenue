Lesotho must create jobs and improve
tax collection to cut its dependence on revenue from the
 Southern African Customs Union  and international aid, the
country’s finance minister said.  The government of Lesotho, a mountainous enclave of about 2
million people within South Africa, gets 60 percent of its
revenue from the five-nation customs union. The union was formed
in 1889 between what are now provinces of South Africa and was
extended to former British protectorates, including Lesotho, and
Namibia in 1910.  “Lesotho needs to be competitive to become a real
sovereign state,”  Timothy Thahane , the finance minister, said
at an event commemorating the centenary of Sacu in Maseru, the
country’s capital, today. “Basotho would not have fought for
100 years if they wanted to join South Africa,” he said, using
the term for Lesotho nationals.  The country gets income from water exports to South Africa
and has for many decades supplied labor to South Africa’s mines.
It has some textile factories and produces mohair.  “Our domestic revenue must be greater than our expenditure
to survive as a country,” Thahane said. “We need to stop
getting crumbs from international donors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
