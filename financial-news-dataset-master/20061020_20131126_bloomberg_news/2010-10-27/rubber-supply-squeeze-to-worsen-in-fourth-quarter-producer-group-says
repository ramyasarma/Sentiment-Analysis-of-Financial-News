A natural rubber supply shortage
will likely “worsen” in the fourth quarter as unseasonal
rainfall continues to disrupt production from key growers, the
Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries said.  Output in Thailand, the largest producer and exporter, is
estimated to fall 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter to 933,000
metric tons, the group said in a monthly bulletin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
