Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
biggest bank by assets, expects a decline in consumer lending
next year, easing fears that Canadians are ramping up household
debt amid rising interest rates.  “We’ve certainly seen growth moderate for a number of
reasons, and I think that’s prudent,”  David McKay , Royal Bank’s
head of Canadian banking, told reporters after an investor event
in Toronto. “Unchecked growth from where we are today would be
a concern for the economy.”  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  told reporters on Oct.
20 that he’s “concerned” about the high level of household
borrowing in Canada. Carney said he’s seen a moderation in
household credit, and noted that the economy is going through
“abnormal times” for interest rates.  Royal Bank has already seen a “significant slowing” of
consumer lending, with growth being about half the rate from a
year ago, McKay said. The growth rate for mortgages, personal
loans and other consumer loans is expected to drop to between 4
percent and 6 percent in the next year, down from the “mid to
upper single digit” levels of the past three months, he said.  “I’m confident that we’re in the range of prudence,”
McKay said. “You’d have to have a fundamental systematic
meltdown in the Canadian market before you’d see major stress.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
