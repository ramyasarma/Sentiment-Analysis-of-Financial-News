Copper declined for a second day as
the dollar strengthened and on speculation that users in China,
the world’s largest consumer, deem the recent rally as excessive
given ample domestic supplies.  Three-month copper reversed an early advance to drop as
much as 0.8 percent to $8,439 a metric ton on the London Metal
Exchange, and traded at $8,440 at 12:10 p.m. in Singapore.
Futures in Shanghai lost as much as 1.4 percent to 64,000 yuan
($9,582) a ton, after earlier gaining 1.1 percent.  “The market has been looking bubbly for a while now and is
due for a correction,” said Wu Tianmin, an analyst at BOC
International Futures Ltd. “Buyers are staying away at these
high prices as China is not short of copper.”  Stockpiles of the metal used in pipes and wires monitored
by the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained for a third week to a
two-month high of 106,275 tons last week. The  dollar  climbed for
a second day against a six-currency basket on speculation that
increased debt purchases by the Federal Reserve will revive the
U.S. economy.  Commodities markets were also pressured lower today by
speculation that the China Securities Regulatory Commission may
visit exchanges to investigate for signs of abnormal trading,
said Chen Yonglin, an analyst at CITIC Newedge Futures Co.,
referring to the government regulator.  China’s Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange may force investors to
settle contracts before they expire, restrict their positions,
or recommend an investigation by the securities watchdog if they
detect abnormal trading, the bourse said in a statement on its
website yesterday.  Zinc, Lead  Zinc in London snapped a five-day winning streak, dropping
by the most in three weeks, as investors deemed the recent rally
to a nine-month high didn’t justify the fundamentals. The metal
used to galvanize steel fell as much as 3.1 percent to $2,535 a
ton, the biggest intraday drop since Oct. 7, before trading at
$2,550.25 a ton.  Lead also declined for the first time in six days, falling
as much as 2 percent to $2,540 a ton, before trading at $2,547 a
ton. The metal rose as much as 1 percent earlier to a nine-month
high of $2,619 a ton.  Zinc and lead gained in the past five days to their highest
prices in nine months after Shenzhen Zhongjin Lingnan Nonfemet
Co., China’s third-largest producer, suspended output at its
biggest smelter of the metals on Oct. 21.  Aluminum in London fell 0.9 percent to $2,368 a ton, nickel
lost 0.8 percent to $23,112 a ton, while tin dropped 0.4 percent
to $26,599 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
