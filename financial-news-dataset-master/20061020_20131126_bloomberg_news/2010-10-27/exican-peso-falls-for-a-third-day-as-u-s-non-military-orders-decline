Mexico’s peso declined for a third
day as orders for non-military durable goods in the U.S., the
nation’s largest trading partner, dropped, signaling a possible
slowdown in business investment.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 12.4515 per dollar at 8:54
a.m. New York time, from 12.4136 yesterday. The decline pared
the currency’s gain to 5.1 percent this year.  “The durable goods number was pretty bad,” said  Ramon Cordova,  a currency strategist at Base Internacional Casa de
Bolsa SA in Monterrey, Mexico. “The concern now is will
something like this mean a slowdown in the recovery during the
next six months?”  Bookings for non-military goods dropped 0.6 percent last
month, the Commerce Department said today. The U.S. purchases
about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 was
little changed at 6.4 percent, according to Banco Santander SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
