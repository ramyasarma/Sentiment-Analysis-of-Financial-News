The 10-year Treasury note  yield ’s
close yesterday above the 55-day moving average indicates the
benchmark yield may move higher, according to analysts at
Citigroup Inc.  The yield exceeded the 55-day average of 2.57 percent,
breaking above the technical level for the first time since
April.  “This should open the way for resistance at 2.85 percent
in the short-term and then the 3.05 percent to 3.10 percent
level,” analysts led by  Tom Fitzpatrick  in New York wrote in a
note to clients. Resistance is an area where sell orders may be
located. A breach of one level often implies an extension of the
move to the next level.  An extended target would be the 200-day moving average, at
3.20 percent, the analysts wrote.  The yield on the 10-year note reached a 2010 high of 4.01
percent in April and a low of 2.33 percent on Oct. 8, according
to Bloomberg data. The record of 2.04 percent was set in
December 2008.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
