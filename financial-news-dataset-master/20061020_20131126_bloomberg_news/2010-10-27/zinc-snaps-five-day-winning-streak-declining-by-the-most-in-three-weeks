Zinc snapped a five-day winning
streak, dropping by the most in three weeks, as investors deemed
the recent rally to a nine-month high didn’t justify the
fundamentals. Lead also declined from a nine-month high.  Zinc fell as much as 2.7 percent to $2,545 a metric ton,
the biggest intraday drop since Oct. 7, and traded at $2,560 a
ton by 11:06 a.m. Singapore time.  Lead also declined for the first time in six days, falling
as much as 1.9 percent to $2,545 a ton, before trading at $2,550
a ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
