Apple Inc.  began taking orders from
customers in China via its online store, as the maker of the
iPhone and iPad tablet computer steps up its efforts to boost
sales in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Apple’s China online store will offer free shipping and
personalized engravings for some products, the Cupertino,
California-based company said in a statement today. The online
applications store will also start a service in simplified
Chinese, the language used in mainland China, it said.  The world’s biggest technology company by market value last
month started selling the iPad and the latest version of the
iPhone in China, and added two stores in Beijing and Shanghai.
Competition in the Chinese consumer electronics market is
increasing as China’s  Lenovo Group Ltd.  and Huawei Technologies
Co. offer rival smartphones.  In China, shipments of iPhones trailed those of smartphones
running on  Nokia Oyj ’s Symbian operating system, and handsets
equipped with  Google Inc .’s Android software in the first half,
according to research firm Analysys International.  Lenovo, China’s biggest personal-computer maker, started
selling its LePhone handset this year and Huawei, the country’s
largest producer of phone equipment, rolled out its Ideos device.
Both products run on the Android operating system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
