Whirlpool Corp. , the world’s largest
appliance maker, reported a 9.2 percent drop in third-quarter
profit as American and European consumers shied away from major
household purchases.  The shares fell the most in five months after the Benton
Harbor, Michigan-based company said today that net income fell
to $79 million, or $1.02 a share. Excluding some items, profit
was $2.22, compared with the $2.23 average of  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  Sales in the quarter increased 0.5 percent to $4.52
billion, with growth slowing from 14 percent in the first half.
Whirlpool, led by Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Fettig , said in
2008 it would fire 5,000 workers through 2010 to reduce costs as
the U.S. housing slowdown and rising unemployment hurt demand
for refrigerators and dishwashers.  “Consumers are pursuing more value-oriented purchases,”
 David MacGregor , an Independence, Ohio-based analyst with
Longbow Research, said in a phone interview. “That doesn’t bode
well for profitability when consumers are going down-market.”
MacGregor rates the shares as “neutral.”  Whirlpool, the maker of Maytag washing machines and
KitchenAid refrigerators,  fell  $4.15, or 4.9 percent, to $80.37
at 9:44 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Earlier they dropped as low as $77.81, the biggest decline since
May.  Revenue  in North America fell 3 percent to $2.4 billion in
the quarter, while sales in Europe shrank 8 percent to $827
million. Revenue rose 13 percent to $1.1 billion in Latin
America and increased 21 percent to $195 million in Asia.  “As expected, we faced a challenging environment during
the quarter which resulted in a significant slowing in sales
growth,” Fettig said in a statement.  A year earlier, third-quarter profit was $87 million, or
$1.15 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
