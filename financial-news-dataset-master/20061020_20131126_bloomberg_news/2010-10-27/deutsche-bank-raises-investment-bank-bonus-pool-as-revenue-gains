Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s biggest
bank, set aside more in compensation for employees of its
corporate and investment bank in the first nine months of 2010
than  Goldman Sachs Group Inc .  Deutsche Bank reserved enough money to pay 285,352 euros
($394,499) to each of the 16,194 workers at the division, which
includes transaction banking, company data show. That compares
with personnel costs per employee of $370,706 at Goldman Sachs,
where the figures include support staff and employees at units
with pay that may be lower than in the investment bank. The
firms didn’t provide more detailed information.  While average compensation at Deutsche Bank’s investment
bank dropped 3.6 percent from the same period a year before,
Goldman Sachs slashed the average worker’s pay 30 percent,
 Credit Suisse Group AG ’s investment bank lowered it 27 percent,
and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s investment bank cut it by 16 percent.
Only UBS AG’s investment bank and Morgan Stanley increased the
average amount of money they allocated per worker so far this
year.  “The market continues to be very competitive and top
talent has its value and its price and we cannot ignore that
fact,” Deutsche Bank Chief Financial Officer  Stefan Krause  said
on a conference call today.  Higher Revenue  Investment banks typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year to pay staff, granting the bulk of the
awards in the form of year-end bonuses. Deutsche Bank set aside
4.62 billion euros for compensation expenses, up from 4.24
billion euros a year ago. Goldman Sachs,  JPMorgan  and Credit
Suisse cut the money they reserve to pay bankers and traders
amid a business slowdown.  Deutsche Bank raised the compensation pool for corporate
and investment banking employees by 9 percent from a year
earlier as it added employees. Average pay compared with 296,037
euros for each of the 14,309 workers a year ago.  Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007,
put aside enough money in the first nine months of 2009 to pay
$527,192 per employee at the time. The number of employees at
the New York-based firm rose to 35,400 this year from 31,700 a
year earlier.  Average compensation per worker doesn’t reflect the amount
of money employees actually receive. Top executives and revenue
producers sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards, while
clerical staff get much smaller salaries.  Deutsche Bank today reported a  third-quarter loss  that was
smaller than estimated as higher profit at the investment bank
cushioned a writedown on its  Deutsche Postbank AG  stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
