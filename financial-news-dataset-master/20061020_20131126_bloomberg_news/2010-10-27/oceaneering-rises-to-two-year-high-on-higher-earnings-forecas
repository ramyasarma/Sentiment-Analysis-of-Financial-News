Oceaneering International  Inc., the
provider of underwater robots to the BP Plc oil spill cleanup
work, rose the most in  almost two years  after reporting third-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates by 14 cents.  Oceaneering , based in Houston, benefited in the quarter
from increased work at BP’s Macondo well site in the Gulf of
Mexico, which was damaged in an April 20 explosion. Oceaneering
also raised earnings guidance for the year.  The company rose $7.05, or 13 percent, to $61.34 at 10:39
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It rose as
high as $62.17 in earlier trading, a 14 percent jump that was
its highest intra-day move since Oct. 29, 2008.  “The impact from work following the BP spill continued to
be strong,”  Stephen Gengaro , an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in
New York, who rates the shares a “hold” and owns none, said
today in a telephone interview. “We were looking for a little
uptick; they surged.”  The company reported $17.1 million in operating income for
its subsea projects unit, while Gengaro said he was expecting
$8.5 million.  Net income in the third quarter rose to $59.2 million, or
$1.09 per share, from $49.8 million, or 90 cents, a year
earlier, Oceaneering said yesterday in a statement released
after the close of trading.  The company expects earnings per share this year to be in a
range between $3.57 and $3.62, up from a previous forecast of
$3.20 to $3.40, Oceaneering said in the statement.  That will “likely be the best in Oceaneering’s history,”
Chief Executive Officer T.  Jay Collins  said in the statement.
Collins estimated 2011 earnings per share will be in the range
of $3.45 to $3.75, “with the possibility of another record
year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
