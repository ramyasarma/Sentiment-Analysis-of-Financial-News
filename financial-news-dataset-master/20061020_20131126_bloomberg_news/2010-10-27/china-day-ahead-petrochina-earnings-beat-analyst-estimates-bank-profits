PetroChina Co. , Asia’s biggest
company by market value, posted a 13 percent gain in third-
quarter profit, beating estimates, as the oil and gas producer
increased output to benefit from higher crude prices.  Net income  rose to 34.7 billion yuan ($5.2 billion), or
0.19 yuan a share, from 30.8 billion yuan, or 0.17 yuan, a year
earlier, China’s largest oil and gas producer said in a
statement to the Shanghai stock exchange. This compares with a
mean estimate of 33.6 billion yuan in a Bloomberg survey of
seven analysts.  PetroChina ramped up output this year with overseas
acquisitions including an Australian coal-seam gas producer and
stakes in two Canadian oil-sands projects to meet demand in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy. Revenue rose 36 percent
in the third quarter as U.S. crude gained 12 percent from a year
earlier to average $76.21 a barrel.  Bank Earnings  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and  Bank of China Ltd.  beat
analysts’ estimates for third-quarter profit by reporting almost
30 percent gains as the nation’s economic growth helped bolster
credit demand and curb defaults.  Net income for Beijing-based  Agricultural Bank  climbed to
24.3 billion yuan ($3.6 billion), from 18.77 billion yuan a year
earlier, in its first quarterly results since completing the
world’s biggest initial public offering in August. Profit at
Bank of China, also based in Beijing, climbed to a record 27.2
billion yuan, according to its statement yesterday.  Ping An  Profit Drops  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. , China’s second-largest
insurer, said profit fell 26 percent as claims rose and the
company set aside greater reserves.  Third-quarter  net income  dropped to 3.15 billion yuan ($471
million), or 0.41 yuan a share, from a revised 4.25 billion yuan,
or 0.58 yuan, a year earlier, Ping An said in a Shanghai stock
exchange filing yesterday. Profit for the first nine months rose
8.8 percent to 12.8 billion yuan.  ZTE Profit Misses  ZTE Corp. , China’s second-biggest maker of telephone
equipment, posted a smaller-than-expected 18 percent gain in
third-quarter profit as sales increased less than estimated.  Net income  rose to 483.9 million yuan ($72.4 million), or
0.17 yuan a share, from 408.6 million yuan, or 0.15 yuan, a year
earlier,  ZTE said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing
yesterday. Projected profit was 525 million yuan, according to
the median estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Sands Gains on Asia  Las Vegas Sands Corp. , the U.S. casino company expanding in
Asia, reported third-quarter earnings that topped analysts’
estimates after it opened a Singapore resort and benefited from
gambling growth in China.  Profit  excluding some items was 34 cents a share, more than
the 24-cent average of 21 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales  jumped 67 percent to $1.91 billion, from $1.14
billion, the Las Vegas-based company said in a statement,
surpassing analysts’ $1.79 billion average  estimate .  China Southern Profit  China Southern Airlines Co. , the nation’s biggest carrier,
said third-quarter profit surged almost 10-fold as air travel
rebounded and the yuan strengthened.  Net income  increased to 3.04 billion yuan ($455 million)
from 284 million yuan a year earlier, the  Guangzhou-based
company  said in Shanghai stock exchange statement. Sales
increased 45 percent to 23.2 billion yuan.  SAIC Earnings  SAIC Motor Corp. , China’s largest domestic automaker, said
third-quarter profit increased 47 percent as it sold more cars
with partners General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG in the
world’s biggest auto market.  Net income  for the quarter climbed to 3.7 billion yuan
($554 million) from 2.53 billion yuan a year earlier, the
Shanghai-based automaker said in a statement to the city’s stock
exchange. Sales more than doubled to 81.6 billion yuan.  Jiangxi Copper Doubles  Jiangxi Copper Co. , China’s biggest producer of the metal,
said third-quarter profit more than doubled as economic growth
boosted demand and prices.  Net income  rose to 1.28 billion yuan ($192 million), or
0.42 yuan a share, from 561 million yuan, or 0.16 yuan, a year
earlier, the Guixi, Jiangxi province-based company said in a
Shanghai stock exchange filing. Sales climbed 50 percent to 19.6
billion yuan.  Poon Donates to Oxford  Hong Kong entrepreneur  Dickson Poon , the owner of fashion
retailer  Harvey Nichols Plc , has donated 10 million pounds
($15.8 million) to the University of Oxford to help build a
facility dedicated to the study of China.  The Dickson Poon China Centre, which will cost 20 million
pounds in total, will help strengthen the university’s relations
with business, government and non-governmental institutions
involved with China, the university said in an e-mailed
statement.  Mixed Green Messages  The Chinese government is facing contradictory criticism
from the U.S. and a UN green investment program over subsidies
to its clean-energy industry, a Chinese industry group said.  The U.S. government probe into a union complaint that China
is unfairly subsidizing its clean-energy companies contrasts
with allegations that Beijing is providing less support than it
could to its wind generators,  Li Junfeng , secretary general of
the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, said in an
interview.  China Gold Reserves  China should buy more gold to diversify its foreign
exchange reserves, International Business Daily, a newspaper
affiliated with the Ministry of Commerce, reported.  China should increase its gold holdings if the country
aspires to “internationalize” its currency, the paper said on
its  website , citing Meng Qingfa, a researcher at the China
Chamber of International Commerce. The 1,054 metric tons of gold
reserves are inadequate, compared with the 8,133 tons held by
the U.S. and 3,408 tons by Germany, he was cited as saying.  Volvo China Factories  Volvo Cars, the Swedish carmaker owned by China’s  Zhejiang
Geely Holding Group Co. , may build vehicles at as many as three
plants in the country, Chief Executive Officer  Stefan Jacoby 
said.  Volvo is committed to increasing production in China, and
its board will decide on sites once it receives approvals from
the country’s regulators, Jacoby said in an interview at an
automotive conference in Stockholm.  MARKETS:  U.S. stocks tumbled, snapping a five-day gain for the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index , as investors speculated that the

gradual.  Alcoa Inc.  and Exxon Mobil Corp. each dropped 1.3 percent
after metal and oil prices declined as the U.S. dollar rose to a
one-week high against the euro.  Sprint Nextel Corp.  slumped 9.9
percent after posting a wider-than-estimated loss.  Broadcom Corp. 
jumped 12 percent as quarterly revenue beat analysts’
