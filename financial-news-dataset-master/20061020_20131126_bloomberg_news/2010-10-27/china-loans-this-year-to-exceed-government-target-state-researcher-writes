New bank lending in China this year
may exceed the government’s 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.12 trillion)
target, Li Ruoyu, a researcher with the State Information
Center, wrote in an article published in today’s Shanghai
Securities News newspaper.  Total new bank lending this year won’t exceed 8 trillion
yuan, Li wrote. It will be difficult for China to keep credit
growth to less than 1.2 trillion yuan in the fourth quarter as
the economy stabilizes and demand for credit from the real
economy remains strong, Li wrote.  China’s banks extended 6.3 trillion yuan of new loans in
the first three quarters of this year. The State Information
Center is a research unit of the National Development and Reform
Commission.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
