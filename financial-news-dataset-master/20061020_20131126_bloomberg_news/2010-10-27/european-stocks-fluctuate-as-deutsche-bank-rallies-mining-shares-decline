European stocks were little changed
as a gain in shares of Deutsche Bank AG offset declines by
mining companies and SAP AG. U.S. futures and Asian shares fell.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose less than 0.1
percent to 267.01 at 10:39 a.m. in London, after falling as much
as 0.7 percent earlier today. Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest
lender, rallied 2.1 percent after posting a narrower-than-
estimated loss, while SAP tumbled 2.8 percent after saying
profit rose less than analysts’ predicted. Rio Tinto Group led
basic-resource companies lower, slipping 2 percent as metals
fell.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December lost 0.4 percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
dropped 1.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
