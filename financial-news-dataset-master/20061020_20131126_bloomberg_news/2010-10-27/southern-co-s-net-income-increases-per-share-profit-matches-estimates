Southern Co. , the second-largest
electricity producer in the U.S., said third-quarter profit
increased 3.4 percent as a warmer-than-average summer boosted
revenue.  Net income rose to $817.2 million from $790 million in the
year-earlier quarter, Atlanta-based Southern said in a statement
today. Per-share profit fell 1 cent to 98 cents a share,
matching the average of 15 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Southern  has increased its number of shares by 38 million
during the last year to an average of 836 million in the third
quarter. Sales rose 14 percent to $5.32 billion in the quarter
as the hottest summer in Georgia since 1980 boosted air
conditioning and electricity use.  “The numbers are in line with expectations,” said Paul
Patterson, an analyst at Glenrock Associates LLC in New York.
“They’ve benefited from the weather.”  Average daily temperatures in Georgia, where Southern’s
largest utility serves 2.3 million clients, reached 80.4 degrees
Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) in the third quarter, according
to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Southern owns 42,932 megawatts of generating capacity,
enough to power more than 34 million homes, based on an estimate
from the U.S. Energy Department. The company won a $3.4 billion
conditional federal loan guarantee to add two nuclear reactors
to the Vogtle station near Waynesboro, Georgia.  Cost Cutting  Southern increased base salaries for its workers 2 percent
this year after freezing them in 2009, Chief Executive Officer
 David M. Ratcliffe  said on July 28. The company cut costs and
postponed spending last year to offset a 4.5 percent drop in
sales.  Southern  fell  21 cents to $38.06 at 10:17 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock, which has three
buys, 20 holds and one sell recommendation from analysts, gained
15 percent this year before today.  Exelon Corp., based in Chicago, is the U.S.’s largest power
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
