Chile’s central bank will increase
borrowing costs by a quarter point for the second straight month
in November as Latin America’s best-performing currency over the
past three months gains strength, a survey of traders and
investors showed.  Policy makers will increase interest rates to 3 percent in
November from 2.75 percent as the peso appreciates to 485 per
U.S. dollar in seven days, according to a bi-weekly survey
published today on the bank’s website. Consumer prices may rise
0.2 percent in October from September as inflation reaches 3.3
percent in 12 months, the survey said.  Chile’s peso fell 0.4 percent against the dollar to 493.55
at 7:43 a.m. New York time from 491.45 yesterday. The peso has
appreciated 5.4 percent against the dollar in the past three
months, beating out the Brazilian real and the five other Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The real exchange rate taking into account inflation is
below the long-term average and has an impact on monetary
policy, central bank President  Jose De Gregorio  said in an Oct.
25 speech in Santiago, when the peso closed at 486.24. A
stronger peso reduces the costs of imports and can mitigate the
need to raise interest rates, he said in a Sept. 12 interview.  The peso’s appreciation against the dollar is a source of
concern, central bank policy maker  Enrique Marshall  said Oct. 25
in northern Chile.  “If it persists, it would have implications for economic
activity and inflation that must be evaluated with extreme
caution,” according to his presentation.  Policy makers slowed the pace of rate increases on Oct. 14
when they raised lending costs to 2.75 percent from 2.50
percent, saying in a statement accompanying the decision the
peso had continued to appreciate against the dollar. Policy
makers had raised rates by a half-point for the four monthly
meetings through September.  Chile’s economy probably expanded more than 7 percent in
the three months through September compared with the previous
year, Finance Minister  Felipe Larrain  said in an Oct. 5 address
to Congress. That would be the fastest pace of growth since
2004.  The economy will grow 5.1 percent this year and 6.1 percent
in 2011, according to the projections the ministry used to
develop its 2011 budget proposal, Larrain said. The ministry
also forecast an average exchange rate for the year of 500 pesos
to the dollar, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
