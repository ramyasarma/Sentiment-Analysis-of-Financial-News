Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, said it opened a “new exploration
frontier” off the country’s northern coast after finding signs
of light oil at a deepwater well.  Petrobras found “large accumulations” of oil in its Barra
well in the  Sergipe-Alagoas Basin , the Rio de Janeiro-based
company said in a regulatory filing today. The discovery at a
depth of 2,341 meters (7,680 feet) of water has larger volumes
of oil than the Guaricema and Dourado fields in shallower waters
of the same basin, Petrobras said.  “Wherever they’re going, discoveries highlight more
potential, especially offshore,” said  Robbert Van Batenburg ,
head of equities research at Louis Capital Markets in New York.
“The question now is the capital expenditures to develop these
wells.”  IBV Brasil Petroleo Ltda., a unit of  Bharat Petroleum Corp. 
and  Videocon Industries Ltd ., has a 40 percent stake in block
BM-SEAL-11 where Petrobras drilled the Barra well. Petrobras,
which owns the remaining 60 percent, said it will drill more
exploration wells in the area.  To contact the reporters on this story:
