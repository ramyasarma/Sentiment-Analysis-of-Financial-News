Uganda’s Electoral Commission
cleared Samuel Lubega, leader of the splinter group of the
opposition Democratic Party, to contest the East African
nation’s presidency next year, Chairman Badru Kiggundu said.  Kiggundu spoke in a presentation broadcast on state
television from the capital, Kampala, yesterday.  This takes the number of candidates seeking to end Ugandan
President  Yoweri Museveni ’s 25-year rule to seven. Uganda is
Africa’s biggest grower of robusta coffee and is set to become
an oil producer when London-based  Tullow Oil Plc  begins
production at the Kasamene field next year. The country has an
estimated 2 billion barrels of oil, with 800 million barrels
already discovered, according to Tullow.  Museveni, leader of the ruling National Resistance
Movement, main opposition leader Kizza Besigye of the Forum for
Democratic Change, former minister Jaberi Bidandi Ssali of the
People’s Progressive Party, the Democratic Party’s Norbert Mao
and Beti Kamya of the Uganda Federal Alliance were cleared on
Oct. 25.  In addition to Lubega, Kiggundu also cleared Abedi Bwanika
of the People’s Development Party, and former United Nations
diplomat  Olara Otunnu  of the Uganda People’s Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
