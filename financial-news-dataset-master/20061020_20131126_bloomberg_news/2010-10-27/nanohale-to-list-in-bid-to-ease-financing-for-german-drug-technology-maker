Nanohale AG , a German developer of
inhalation technology for diabetes drugs, plans to list its
shares on the Frankfurt stock exchange next month to ease the
way for future financing.  Nanohale will have a market value of 45 million euros ($62
million) to 50 million euros after listing,  Nicolas Combe , a
board member at the Dortmund-based company, said in an
interview. The listing will probably take place by Nov. 19 after
 BaFin , Germany’s market regulator, approves the prospectus, he
said.  Sueddeutsche Aktienbank AG  is the sponsor for the listing,
Combe said. The company is listing existing shares, not selling
new stock in an initial public offering, he said today. Combe
said 65 percent of Nanohale’s shares will remain in a pool of
nine investors, including the founders, while 35 percent of the
company’s capital can be traded immediately, he added.  “On the medium and long term, financing for further growth
will be easier when we are listed on the stock exchange,” Combe
said. The company will also become better known after the
listing, he added.  Nanohale will start a joint venture with Russian
Technologies AO, a Moscow-based state holding with assets from
weapons to cars, this year. Nanohale expects to generate
“significant revenue” in 2011 and profit in the following
years from the venture, in which both parties will hold 50
percent, Combe said.  Nanohale’s shares are owned by 45 investors, including the
company’s founders as well as family offices and investment
funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
