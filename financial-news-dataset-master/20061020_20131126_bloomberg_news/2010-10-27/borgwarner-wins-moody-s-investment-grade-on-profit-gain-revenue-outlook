BorgWarner Inc. ’s debt was upgraded
to investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service because of the
auto-parts maker’s growth potential and an operating performance
that included a sixfold increase in third-quarter profit.  BorgWarner was raised one  level  to Baa3 from Ba1. The
company said today third-quarter profit rose more than expected
on demand for turbochargers and expansion in China. Net income
increased to $111.7 million, or 87 cents a share, from
$17.2 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier.  The company raised its annual profit and sales forecast as
it expects to grow faster than the market. China, where sales
rose about 70 percent, now represents 6 percent of sales, double
last year’s portion. Revenue rose 37 percent to $1.41 billion,
exceeding the $1.27 billion average of 10 analysts’  estimates .  “We’re seeing tremendous increases in wins,” Chief
Executive Officer  Tim Manganello , said on a conference call with
analysts and investors. “We’re being awarded a lot of business
right now and it will show up in the next two to five years.”  BorgWarner makes turbochargers that automakers use to
improve the power and efficiency of smaller engines. Turbo sales
are accelerating as car companies try to meet U.S. mileage
standards.  Excluding some items, profit was 71 cents a share, the
Auburn Hills, Michigan-based company said in a statement. The
average estimate of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was
63 cents a share.  Profit this year will be $2.85 to $2.95 a share, compared
with a July forecast for as much as $2.80. Sales will rise about
40 percent compared with July’s forecast of as much as
35 percent growth.  BorgWarner has $1.19 billion in  debt , according to its
earnings release. About $253 million is affected by the Moody’s
upgrade. Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings rate BorgWarner’s
debt BBB, or two levels above speculative grade.  BorgWarner  rose  81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $54.62 at
2:29 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares gained 62 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
