Typhoon Chaba strengthened over the
Pacific Ocean overnight as it approached the Japanese island of
Okinawa and is forecast to reach Tokyo within three days, the
U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center said.  Chaba, the 16th storm of the northwestern Pacific season,
was about 330 kilometers (200 miles) south of Naha, Okinawa at 3
a.m. local time today, the center said in an  advisory  on its
website. Its sustained winds increased to 204 kilometers per
hour from 185 kph, making it a Category 3 Storm, the third-
strongest on the five-step  Saffir-Simpson  scale.  Category 3 storms are capable of “devastating damage,”
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  Chaba was moving north-northeast at 17 kph and is forecast
to pass about 190 kilometers to the east of the U.S. air force
base of  Kadena  on Okinawa before turning northeast toward
Honshu. Chaba may make landfall in Shizuoka prefecture,
southwest of Tokyo, before crossing the capital by Oct. 31, the
center said.  Chaba is the name of a tropical flower in Thailand,
according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which  lists  names
assigned to storms in the northwest Pacific.  To contact the reporters on the story:
