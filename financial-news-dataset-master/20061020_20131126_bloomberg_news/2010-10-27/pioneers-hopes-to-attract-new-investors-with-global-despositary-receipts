Pioneers Holding , Egypt’s second-
biggest publicly traded securities company, will issue its first
global depository receipts to be traded in London “very soon,”
Board Member Khaled El Tayeb said.  “This will help attract new investors, especially foreign
institutions, which would help us create better synergies in the
future,” El Tayeb said by telephone from Cairo.  The Cairo-based firm selected Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
to manage the sale of existing shares, it said in a regulatory
filing today.  Shares of Pioneers were unchanged at 3.59 Egyptian pounds
at 11:07 a.m. in Cairo, valuing the company at 1.88 billion
pounds ($330 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
