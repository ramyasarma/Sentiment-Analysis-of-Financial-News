The krone stayed lower against the
dollar and fluctuated versus the euro after Norway’s central
bank left its benchmark deposit rate at 2 percent and said it
will push back plans to increase borrowing costs.  The krone weakened 0.5 percent to 5.8960 per dollar at 1:05
p.m. in London. It was little changed against the euro at 8.1416
after depreciating as much as 0.4 percent.  Oslo-based Norges Bank’s decision to leave the overnight
 deposit rate  unchanged was forecast by all 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank also said it will push
back plans to resume monetary tightening as it waits for more
signs of a recovery abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
