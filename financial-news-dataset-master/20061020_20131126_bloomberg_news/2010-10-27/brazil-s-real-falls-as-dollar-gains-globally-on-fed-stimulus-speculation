Brazil’s real fell after the U.S.
dollar gained against most currencies on speculation the Federal
Reserve will buy less debt than estimated to stimulate the
economy.  The currency weakened 0.29 percent to 1.7086 per dollar at
12:08 p.m. in Sao Paulo (10:08 a.m. New York).  “The market today is reacting to the external dollar
scenario,” said  Alexandre Povoa , portfolio manager at Modal
Asset Management in Rio de Janeiro.  Yields on interest rate futures rose in the longest
maturities after election polls showed that the government’s
candidate, Dilma Rousseff, maintained her advantage over the
opposition candidate ahead of the Oct. 31 presidential vote.  The January 2021 yield gained 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 11.78 percent. Rousseff had a 12 point-lead
over Jose Serra in a Datafolha poll released late yesterday. The
January 2012 yield fell 1 basis point to 11.34 percent.  “There was speculation yesterday that the polls would show
a smaller difference. As this was not confirmed by today’s poll,
the market reacted with higher yields”, said  Huang Kuo Seen ,
portfolio manager at Grau Gestao de Ativos, who helps manage 250
million reais in Sao Paulo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
