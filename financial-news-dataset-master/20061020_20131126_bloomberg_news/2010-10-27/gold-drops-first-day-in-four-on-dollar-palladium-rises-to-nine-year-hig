Gold futures closed at the lowest
price in three weeks as the dollar’s rally curbed demand for the
precious metal as an alternative investment.  The greenback advanced for the fourth time in five sessions
against a basket of major currencies on speculation that the
Federal Reserve will buy less debt than analysts projected in an
effort to revive the economy. From Sept. 1 to Oct. 20, the
dollar dropped 6.5 percent, while gold climbed to a record 16
times, reaching $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14, the highest ever.  “The longer-term question will be on how much of the Fed’s
action has already been priced in,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an
analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $16, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $1,322.60 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, the lowest closing price for a most-active
contract since Oct. 4. The metal dropped for the fourth time in
five sessions.  Assets of the metal in  exchange-traded-products  declined
0.28 metric ton to 2,096.13 tons yesterday, the eighth straight
drop, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers.
Holdings are up 17 percent this year and reached a record
2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14.  The next Fed policy meeting starts on Nov. 2. The central
bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero percent to
0.25 percent since December 2008 and purchased Treasuries and
mortgage-backed securities in a bid to spur growth.  “With the Fed poised to print more money, we expect dips
will be viewed favorably by investors, with longer-term concerns
about inflation and debasing of fiat currencies,” said  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London.  Silver Retreats  Silver futures for December delivery fell 42.6 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $23.404 an ounce.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s  Bart Chilton  yesterday said “repeated efforts” took place to
influence prices.  “There have been fraudulent efforts to persuade and
deviously control that price,” Chilton said at a hearing in
Washington, alleging that violations of the Commodity Exchange
Act occurred. The agency yesterday proposed new rules against
manipulation.  Should Chilton’s allegations prove to be true, “it could
lead to further volatility and higher prices,” Goldcore Ltd. in
Dublin said in a report.  Platinum futures for January delivery dropped $25.90, or
1.5 percent, to $1,678.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery fell $6.30, or 1
percent, to $619.15 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached
$639.50, the highest level since June 2001. This year, the
commodity has jumped 51 percent, the most among the precious
metals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
