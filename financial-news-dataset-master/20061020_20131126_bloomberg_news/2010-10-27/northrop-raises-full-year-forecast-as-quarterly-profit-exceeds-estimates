Northrop Grumman Corp. , the U.S.
defense contractor considering a sale of its shipbuilding unit,
raised its full-year earnings forecast after posting third-
quarter profit that increased 1.4 percent.  Net income climbed to $497 million, or $1.67 a share, from
$490 million, or $1.53, a year earlier, the Los Angeles-based
company said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit
was $1.64 a share. Analysts forecast $1.46, the average of 19
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 4.4 percent to $8.7
billion.  Chief Executive Officer  Wes Bush  announced in July the
possible sale or spinoff of the shipbuilding unit to focus on
its electronics, aerospace and information-systems businesses.
Bush has also said improving profit margins is a higher priority
than winning new orders.  The company filed documents this month with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission as a step toward a possible
spinoff of the ship unit. Four private-equity firms are also
exploring bids for the unit, people familiar with the matter
said.  Northrop increased its projection for 2010 profit to as
much as $7 a share. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict $6.86
on average. In July, the company said annual earnings would be
as much as $6.80 a share.  Northrop  advanced  44 cents to $61.35 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have climbed 9.9
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
