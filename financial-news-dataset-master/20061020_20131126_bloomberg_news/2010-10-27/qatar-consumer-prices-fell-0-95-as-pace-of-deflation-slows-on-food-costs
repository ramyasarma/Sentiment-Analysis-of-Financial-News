Qatar’s pace of deflation slowed
last month as food, drink and tobacco prices increased.  Consumer prices  fell 0.95 percent in the 12 months through
September, compared with an annual drop of 2.1 percent a month
earlier, the Gulf nation’s statistics authority said on its
website today. Prices were little changed in the month.  Rent, fuel and power costs recorded an annual decline of
11.6 percent while food, beverages and tobacco rose 2.4 percent,
the authority said. The biggest increase was in the cost of
entertainment, which rose 6 percent.  Qatar cut its overnight deposit rate by half a percentage
point to 1.5 percent in August, a move the central bank said was
prompted by deflation and low global borrowing costs. The
government predicts that inflation, which reached 15 percent in
2008, will be 1 percent this year.  While prices are still lower than a year earlier in Qatar,
they are rising in most neighboring Persian Gulf states. Saudi
Arabia, the region’s largest economy, had an inflation rate of
5.9 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
