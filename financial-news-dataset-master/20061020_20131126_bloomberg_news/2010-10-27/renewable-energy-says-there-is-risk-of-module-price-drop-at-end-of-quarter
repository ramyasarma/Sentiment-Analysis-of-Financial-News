Renewable Energy Corp. ASA said
there’s a risk of a price decline for solar modules toward the
end of this quarter because they will be exposed to reductions
in feed-in tariffs in 2011.  The company expects to produce 165 megawatts in modules in
the fourth quarter, and targets 490 megawatts for all of 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
