Tourism has overtaken the dairy
industry as New Zealand’s biggest export industry as foreign
visitor spending recovered and a drought curbed milk production,
a government report showed.  Spending by foreign tourists rose 1.6 percent to NZ$9.54
billion ($7.1 billion) in the year ended March 31, Statistics
New Zealand said in a  report  released in Wellington today.
Exports of butter, cheese and milk powder fell 10 percent to
NZ$8.97 billion, the agency said  Tourism spending is recovering after a revised 0.7 percent
decline last year -- the first drop in a decade -- as the global
financial crisis curbed travel. Exports make up 30 percent of
New Zealand’s $125 billion economy.  Foreign visitors have been attracted by the mountains and
rivers which formed the backdrop to the “Lord of the Rings”
film trilogy. The report comes as Prime Minister  John Key  meets
executives from Warner Bros. Productions Ltd. to convince them
to film the two-part Rings prequel ‘The Hobbit’’ in New Zealand.  Tourism spending including domestic travelers increased 2.1
percent to NZ$22.42 billion and made up 8.7 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ended March 31, from 8.8 percent a
year earlier, the statistics agency said. Today’s report is the
annual assessment of the contribution of tourism to the economy.  Employment  in the tourism industry fell for a second year,
declining 1.6 percent to the equivalent of 92,900 full-time
positions, the report showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
