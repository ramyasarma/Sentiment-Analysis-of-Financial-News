European stocks  sank as results at
companies from SAP AG to Heineken NV missed estimates and
investors speculated whether the Federal Reserve will announce
sufficient measures next week to keep the recovery on track.  Rio Tinto Group led basic-resource shares lower as metals
slid. SAP, the world’s biggest maker of business-management
software, tumbled the most in five months as profit lagged
analyst estimates. Heineken slid 4.3 percent after beer sales
missed forecasts. Greek stocks slumped as the government said
last year’s budget deficit was larger than previously estimated.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropped 0.8 percent to
264.93 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the biggest decline in
five weeks. The measure has still climbed 2 percent this month
amid speculation the Fed will unveil another round of bond
purchases at its November meeting, a tactic for boosting the
economy known as quantitative easing.  “We see disappointing numbers coming in, like SAP this
morning, and it will be hard not to have a correction,” said
 Andreas Lipkow , an equity trader at MWB Fairtrade
Wertpapierhandelsbank AG in Frankfurt. “The market is very
bullish on QE numbers and there might be some disappointment.”  The Fed is likely to offer a program of Treasury purchases
worth a few hundred billion dollars over several months at its
meeting next week, the Wall Street Journal reported, without
saying where it obtained the information. That compares with an
asset-purchase program of about $2 trillion dollars during the
financial crisis, the newspaper said.  Earnings Season  Of the 90 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have announced
results since Oct. 7, 68 percent have beaten  analyst estimates 
for per-share income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In the U.S., 85 percent of S&P 500 companies have topped
predictions in the period,  the data  show. Analysts predict 26
percent growth in third-quarter profit from a year earlier for
S&P 500 companies, a fourth straight increase, analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg show.  National benchmark indexes fell in 16 of the 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.1 percent,
France’s CAC 40 retreated 1 percent and Germany’s DAX slipped
0.7 percent.  Greece’s ASE Index slumped 1.9 percent after Finance
Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said a review of the 2009
budget showed the deficit was greater than 15 percent of gross
domestic product, more than previously estimated.  Portuguese Talks  In Portugal, the  PSI-20  lost 1.3 percent as the government
and the main opposition party broke off talks on the biggest
budget cuts since at least the 1970s, threatening passage of the
2011 plan to tame the euro-region’s fourth-biggest deficit.  Rio Tinto, the world’s  third-largest mining company , slid
2.6 percent to 4,052.5 pence, while BHP Billiton Ltd., the
biggest, slipped 1.5 percent to 2,163.5 pence. Xstrata Plc
declined 3.8 percent to 1,264 pence. A gauge of basic-resource
shares had the largest decline among all 19 industry groups in
the Stoxx 600, falling 2.1 percent.  Copper fell in New York and London as the dollar
strengthened and some investors sold the metal after a rally to
the highest price in more than 27 months.  SAP sank 2.8 percent to 37.23 euros, the biggest drop since
May. The software company reported third-quarter net income of
501 million euros ($692 million), missing the 553 million-euro

36.37 euros. Revenue excluding the effect of acquisitions fell
2.1 percent in the third quarter, compared with the median
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a 0.4
percent drop.  Soco International Plc sank 11 percent to 292 pence, the
worst performance in the Stoxx 600, as it said it will plug and
abandon the Kinganga Nyanya well in the Democratic Republic of
Congo after the main target area was found not to have
hydrocarbons.  Renewable Energy Corp. ASA declined 6.2 percent to 20.75
kroner. The Norwegian producer of solar-energy components said
earnings may be little changed in the last three months of the
year amid falling silane gas sales and pressure on module prices
because of cuts in German subsidies.  YIT Oyj  plummeted 7.4 percent to 17.30 euros as Finland’s
biggest builder reported third-quarter net income of 19.7
million euros, missing the 40.1 million-euro average estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Puma Downgrades  Puma AG  lost 4.2 percent to 243.60 euros as CA Cheuvreux
lowered its recommendation on the sporting-goods maker to
“underperform” from “outperform” while Kepler cut its rating
to “hold” from “buy.”    Deutsche Bank AG  rose 1 percent to 41.59 euros as Germany’s

of bakery ingredients reported third-quarter sales of 783.7
million euros compared with 634.5 million euros a year earlier.  “Strong results from CSM justify our conviction buy
stance,” MF Global analysts wrote in a note. “Positive news
flow is highly likely over the next six months.”  Swedish Match AB  increased 4.2 percent to 187.6 kronor.
Europe’s largest maker of smokeless tobacco products said third-
quarter net income from continuing operations was 729 million
kronor ($108 million), beating the average 687 million-krona
estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
