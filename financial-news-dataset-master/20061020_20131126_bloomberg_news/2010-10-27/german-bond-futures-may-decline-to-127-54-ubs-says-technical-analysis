German bund futures may decline to
as low as 127.54 should they break below a key support level,
UBS AG said, citing technical indicators.  “Bunds are bearish while they trade below 129.99,” the
high trade on Oct. 25,  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income
technical strategy at UBS in London, wrote in a research note
today. “As long as this remains the case, the expectation is
for limited bounces and further price weakness. A break below
yesterday’s 129.19 low will be the next bearish trigger.”  The December bund contract fell 0.5 percent to 128.66 as of
10:55 a.m. in London.  A close under 129.08, the low from Sept. 17, will be seen
“as a new selling opportunity,” Adcock said. “We will be
looking for an even deeper sell-off to at least the 127.54
Aug. 5 low trade.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. A support level is an area on a chart where
analysts anticipate orders to buy a security to be grouped and a
resistance level is an area where they anticipate sell orders to
be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
