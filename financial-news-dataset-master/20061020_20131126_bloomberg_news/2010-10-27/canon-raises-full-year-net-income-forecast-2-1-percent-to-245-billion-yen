Canon Inc. , the world’s largest
camera maker, raised its full-year profit forecast 2.1 percent
citing cost cuts and higher camera shipments.  The company expects to report a  net income  of 245 billion
yen ($3 billion) this year compared with an April forecast of
240 billion yen, Canon said in a  statement  in Tokyo today. The
company also raised its operating profit forecast while slashing
its prediction for sales this year.  Canon raised its annual forecast for camera sales as
developed economies recover and China leads growth in emerging
markets. Stronger sales, cost cuts and other efforts to improve
profitability may help the company overcome the effects of a
stronger yen, which is trading near a 15-year high, said  Toshizo Tanaka , Canon’s executive vice president.  “Investors have started to pay more attention to whether
Canon can sustain growth in the coming year under the pressure
of the strong yen,” said  Hisashi Moriyama , a Tokyo-based
analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, who  rates  the stock “neutral.”
He spoke before the earnings were announced.  The maker of the PowerShot camera models, scanners and
copiers fell 2.3 percent to 3,620 yen before the earnings were
announced. The shares have declined 7.4 percent this year.  Canon also reported net income jumped 86 percent in the
third quarter to 68.2 billion yen. That beat the 58.5 billion
yen average of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Camera Sales  The company expects camera sales this year to be 26.7
million units compared with a July projection of 26.5 million
units.  Operating  profit , or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, may be 390 billion yen this year
against a previous forecast for 360 billion yen, Canon said.
Sales may be 3.71 trillion yen compared with a previous forecast
for 3.75 trillion yen, the company said.  Income at the office-equipment division, Canon’s biggest
last year, rose 30 percent to 76.3 billion yen in the quarter as
revenue gained 26 percent to 505 billion yen.  Profit at the consumer division including cameras increased
14 percent to 58.8 billion yen while revenue gained 3.2 percent
to 324 billion yen.  Canon, which generated 78 percent of sales outside Japan
last year, today forecast the dollar will average 80 yen and the
euro 115 yen in the last quarter. That compares with 90 yen and
110 yen respectively estimated in July.  The world’s second-largest printer maker loses about 4.7
billion yen of six-month operating profit for every 1 yen
decline in the value of the dollar and 2.7 billion yen of income
for each 1 yen decline by the euro, the company said in July.  The yen gained 17 percent against the euro and 11 percent
against the dollar in the first nine months of 2010, the best
performer among 17 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
