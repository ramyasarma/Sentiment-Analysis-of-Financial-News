Desire Petroleum Plc  and  Rockhopper
Exploration Plc  surged in London trading on speculation that
they found oil at the Rachel well off the Falkland Islands.  Desire rose 76 percent to 117.5 pence, the biggest one-day
gain since listing in April 1998, as of the 4:30 p.m. close.
Rockhopper, which owns a 7.5 percent stake in the well, rose 6.1
percent to 318.25 pence.  “There’s a rumor that the Rachel well has come in,” said
 Peter Hitchens , an analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co. in London.
“People realize that this is potentially a major oil province,
and there’s a lot of speculative interest. We’re going to bounce
all over the place.”  Desire is still down more than 20 percent since the start
of the month after saying that Rachel’s original target came up
dry and that it would drill a sidetrack well. This year
Rockhopper made the first discovery that has the potential for
commercial development around the islands that U.K. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher went to war to defend in 1982.  A spokesman for Desire in London said he didn’t know of any
reason for the share price move. The company doesn’t plan to
issue a statement on it, he said.  Desire said yesterday that the sidetrack well was about 500
meters (1,640 feet) away from its target depth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
