Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  is unlikely to stand for re-election next
year after the death of her husband, Former President  Nestor Kirchner  today, Bank of America Corp. said.  Fernandez “has low chances of gathering the necessary
support of the Peronist party to stand for re-election in
2011,”  Marcos Buscaglia  and  David Beker , economist and
strategist at Bank of America in New York, wrote in a note
today. “The Peronist party is likely to unite behind an
alternative candidate.”  Kirchner, who between 2003 and 2007 helped his country
recover from default and devaluation, died of a heart attack at
their home in the Patagonian town of El Calafate. Argentine
bonds and stocks gained as the death of the former leader
bolstered investors’ speculation that opposition lawmakers will
win next year’s presidential election.  The former president’s death reduces uncertainty for
investors as to whether the Kirchners would stay in power after
2011, according to the Bank of America report.  “The year ahead is likely to be uncertain as Nestor
Kirchner was the power broker in the government,” Buscaglia and
Beker wrote, “but we expect the opposition to facilitate
 Cristina Kirchner ’s remaining tenure of government.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
