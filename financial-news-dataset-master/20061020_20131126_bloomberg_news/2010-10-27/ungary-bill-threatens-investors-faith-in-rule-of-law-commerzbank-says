Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor
Orban’s drive to strip the nation’s Constitutional Court of its
power to hear cases involving budget issues is undermining the
faith of investors in the rule of law, Commerzbank AG said.  Orban ’s Fidesz party yesterday submitted a bill after the
court annulled a law that retroactively levied a 98 percent tax
on public-worker severance packages in excess of 2 million
forint ($10,096).  “For money markets and investors, these plans threaten the
rule of law,” Commerzbank AG said in a note to clients today.  Fidesz, elected in April, is the first party since the fall
of communism two decades ago to win a two-thirds majority in
Parliament, enough to change the Constitution. The party is
working on a new Constitution which it plans to pass next year.  The bill submitted yesterday would also bar the top court
from reviewing the suspension of parts of social security
payments into private pension funds for the next 14 months, a
law approved two days ago,  Nepszabadsag  reported, citing Fidesz
parliamentary leader Janos Lazar.  The  Stabilitas Penztarszovetseg , an association
representing private pension funds, has said it will take the
issue to the Constitutional Court. The bill would also bar
referendums on the pension law, the daily said, citing Lazar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
