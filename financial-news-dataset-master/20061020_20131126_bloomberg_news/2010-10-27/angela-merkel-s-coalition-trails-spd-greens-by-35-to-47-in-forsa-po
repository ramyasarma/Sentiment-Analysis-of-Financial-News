German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
coalition with the Free Democrats trailed the opposition by 12
percentage points in a Forsa poll for Hamburg-based Stern
magazine.  Merkel’s Christian Democrats and their CSU Bavarian allies
dropped one point to 30 percent support in the weekly poll,
while the FDP gained a point to 5 percent, the threshhold for
parliamentary representation, Stern said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The opposition Greens had 24 percent backing and the Social
Democrats 23 percent, enough for an absolute majority if
elections were held now, Stern said. The anti-capitalist Left
party had 11 percent.  Merkel’s coalition is near historic lows even as economic
sentiments gains. For the first time this year, more voters say
they are optimistic about the economic outlook than pessimistic,
by 36 percent to 31 percent, Stern said.  Forsa polled 2,502 voters on Oct. 18-22. The margin of
error was as much as 2.5 percentage points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
