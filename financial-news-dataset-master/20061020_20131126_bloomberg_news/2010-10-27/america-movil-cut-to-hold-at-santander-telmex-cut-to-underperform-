America Movil SAB had its rating cut
to “hold” from “buy,” at Banco Santander, which said the
stock’s 13.6 percent increase in U.S. dollar terms since mid-
September reduces its “upside potential.”  Telefonos de Mexico SAB was downgraded to “underperform”
from “hold” at Santandar, which cited “overblown” market
expectations on new services.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
