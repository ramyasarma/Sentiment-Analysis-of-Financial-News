Japan’s sale of 2.6 trillion yen
($32 billion) in two-year notes may have a lowest-accepted price
of 99.915, according to the median forecast of 14 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 0.1 percent
notes ranged from 99.915 to 99.920, according to the survey.
Nine traders said 99.915 and five said 99.920.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
announce the results at 12:45 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
