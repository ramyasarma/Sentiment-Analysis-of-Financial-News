Snam Rete Gas SpA, the owner of
Italy’s natural gas grid, said profit rose 20 percent in the
third quarter as demand for the fuel boosted the transportation
and distribution businesses.  Net income advanced to 280 million euros ($386 million)
from 234 million euros a year earlier, the Milan-based company
said in a stock exchange statement today. That  beat  the 264-
million euro average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue rose 17 percent to 831 million euros.  Snam earnings benefited from increasing demand for gas
which the company forecasts will be more than 80 billion cubic
meters in 2010, compared with 78 billion cubic meters a year
earlier. More than half of the company’s investments in the
first nine months of 2010 went into the natural gas
transportation and regasification business, it said.  Snam is developing its distribution network and expects
active delivery points to increase slightly at the end of 2010
compared with last year’s 5.8 million users, it said.  Positive earnings results will allow Snam to achieve its
operating cost reduction targets, Chief Executive Officer  Carlo Malacarne  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
