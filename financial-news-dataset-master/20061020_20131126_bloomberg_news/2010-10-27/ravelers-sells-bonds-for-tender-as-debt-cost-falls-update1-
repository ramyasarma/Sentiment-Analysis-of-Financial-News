Travelers Cos. , the insurer added to
the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2009, sold $1.25 billion of
notes as it seeks to tender for subordinated debt and to take
advantage of borrowing costs at about the lowest on record.  The insurer sold $750 million of 5.35 percent, 30-year
bonds and $500 million of 3.9 percent, 10-year notes in an
offering boosted from $1 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company tapped the U.S. corporate bond market after
Chief Executive Officer  Jay Fishman  told investors last week the
cost of debt versus equity has widened to the most he’s seen in
his career. Companies tendered for $30.5 billion of bonds last
month, the most since April, and may buy another $24.3 billion
this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s a continued onslaught of companies trying to buy
back their debt,” said  Tom Murphy , a money manager who helps
oversee more than $22 billion of investment-grade credit at
Columbia Management in Minneapolis. “In this environment, I
don’t think investors are necessarily going to penalize a
company taking out higher-coupon debt to replace with lower
coupon debt. That’s just smart capital management.”  The weighted average  cost of debt capital  for Travelers is
0.61 percent, while the weighted average cost of equity capital
is 7.27 percent, Bloomberg data show.  ‘My Career’  The average borrowing cost on investment-grade debt tumbled
to 3.56 percent on Oct. 8, the lowest on record, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Corporate Master index,
which was made available in October 1986. Yesterday, yields were
3.68 percent.  “There has at least in my career never been a period where
the gap between the cost of debt and the cost of equity has been
any wider than it is today,” Fishman said in an Oct. 21
earnings call. “It tells you that the marketplace is at the
moment somewhat upside down.”  Travelers  repurchased  $600 million of common shares in the
third quarter, a “higher amount” than what’s typical for that
period, Chief Financial Officer  Jay Benet  said in the conference
call. The company has bought back 66.8 million common shares for
$3.4 billion this year, Travelers said in an Oct. 21 statement.  The 10-year notes issued today yield 120 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, and the 30-year bonds pay a
spread of 135 basis points, Bloomberg data show. Travelers sold
$500 million of 5.9 percent, 10-year notes in May 2009 at a
spread of 225 basis points, its most recent bond offering,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Terminate Covenant  Travelers is seeking to terminate a covenant that says the
insurer can’t buy back its 6.25 percent hybrid securities due in
2067 for another 37 years unless it uses a sale of stock or
equity-like securities to do so, according to a statement
distributed by Business Wire.  The insurer is offering holders of its 6.25 percent fixed-
to-floating-rate junior subordinated debt maturing in 2067
$1,050 for bonds with a face value of $1,000, according to the
statement. A “replacement capital covenant” prevents it from
completing the tender offer with cash from today’s debt sale
unless holders of its 6.75 percent senior notes due 2036 agree
to terminate it.  Travelers is offering owners of those bonds $5 for
securities with a face value of $1,000 to consent to dissolve
the covenant, according to the statement.  Proceeds from today’s offering may be used to repurchase $1
billion of the existing subordinated debt, the insurer said
today in a regulatory filing that didn’t include the sale’s size
or timing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
