Areva SA has scheduled a meeting of
its supervisory board for Nov. 16 to discuss a share sale by the
end of the year, daily Les Echos reported, citing shareholder
documents.  Investors in the maker of nuclear reactors will vote on the
plan at a meeting on Dec. 10, according to the newspaper. The
French government would sell Areva shares to Electricite de
France SA in a second operation, planned for mid-2011, Les Echos
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
