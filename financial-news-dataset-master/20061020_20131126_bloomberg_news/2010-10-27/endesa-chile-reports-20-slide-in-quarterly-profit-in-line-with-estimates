Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA ,
Chile’s largest generator known as Endesa Chile, reported a 20
percent drop in quarterly profit as lower rainfall in Chile
reduced hydroelectric generation, pushing up costs.  Endesa’s  net income fell  to 143 billion pesos from 178
billion peso a year ago, according to data posted in the website
of Chile’s securities regulator. The average estimate of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 141 billion pesos. Enersis
SA, Endesa’s controlling shareholder, posted a 17 percent
decline in profit for the same period.  “Endesa Chile’s power generation mix, with hydrogenation
down 29 percent and thermal generation up 122 percent year on
year, caused it to be a net buyer in the Chilean spot market,
increasing variable costs,” Celfin Capital SA said in a note to
clients before the results were released.  Endesa Chile rose 0.9 percent to 866 pesos at 1:54 p.m. New
York time in Santiago trading. Enersis gained 0.9 percent to
226.01 pesos  Endesa Chile’s quarterly sales rose to 663 billion pesos
from 614 billion pesos. The Santiago-based company benefitted
from higher demand in Chile, Argentina, Colombia and Peru, the
countries where it operates,  Tomas Gonzalez , an analyst at
Celfin, wrote.  Enersis posted profit of 144 billion pesos in the quarter,
down from 174 billion pesos a year ago, while its sales rose to
1.64 trillion pesos from 1.54 trillion pesos, according to a
separate statement released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
