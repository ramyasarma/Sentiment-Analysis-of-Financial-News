Sugar fell to a one-week low in New
York after India, the world’s second-biggest producer, said it
may consider allowing exports for the first time in two years.
Cocoa and coffee prices gained in London.  India may export as much as 2.5 million metric tons of
refined sugar in the year ending Sept. 30 after importing 5
million tons of the raw variety a year earlier, Simbhaoli Sugars
Ltd., said. The nation will produce 25 million tons in the year
that began this month, the milling company said. Brazil is the
largest grower.  “The market is sensing increasing supply,” said  James Kirkup , the head of sugar broking at ABN Amro Markets (U.K.)
Ltd. in London. “India is the threat.”  Raw sugar for March delivery dropped 0.31 cent, or 1.1
percent, to 27.65 cents a pound at 11 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Earlier, the price touched 27.41 cents, the lowest
level since Oct. 19.  In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery
declined $14.30, or 2 percent, to $694 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Before today, raw sugar gained 19 percent this month on
speculation that China, the third-biggest consumer, is boosting
imports, Kirkup said.  India is the leading consumer, followed by the European
Union, U.S. government data show.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery advanced 18
pounds, or 0.9 percent, to 1,938 pounds ($3,057) a ton.  Cocoa futures for December delivery gained $21, or 0.7
percent, to $2,910 a ton in New York.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery rose
$33, or 1.8 percent, to $1,912 a ton. Earlier, the price reached
$1,927, the highest level for a most-active contract since Oct.
7, 2008.  In New York, arabica-coffee futures for December delivery
were little changed at $2.016 a pound. Yesterday, the price
reached a 13-year high of $2.046.  To contact the reporters on this story:
