Typhoon Chaba strengthened to a
Category 3 Storm over the Pacific Ocean south of Okinawa and is
forecast to gain power as it approaches the Japanese island
tomorrow, the U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center said.  Chaba, the 16th storm of the northwestern Pacific season,
was about 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of Naha, Okinawa at 3
p.m. local time today, the center said in an  advisory  on its
website. Its sustained winds increased to 185 kilometers per
hour from 176 kph and the storm was moving north at 15 kph.  Category 3 storms, the third-strongest on the five-step
 Saffir-Simpson  scale, are capable of “devastating damage,”
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Chaba’s winds
are expected to strengthen further to 204 kph by 3 p.m.
tomorrow.  Chaba’s eye is forecast to pass about 120 kilometers to the
east of the U.S. air force base of  Kadena  on Okinawa before
turning northeast toward Japan’s main island, Honshu. Chaba may
make landfall south of Osaka, on Oct. 30, the center said.  Chaba is the name of a tropical flower in Thailand,
according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which  lists  names
assigned to storms in the northwest Pacific.  To contact the reporter on the story:
