The law firm advising the trustee of
 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ’s brokerage was paid $107.8
million for two years’ work liquidating the remains of the
broker dealer, according to a bankruptcy court  filing .  Trustee  James Giddens  and his law firm Hughes Hubbard &
Reed LLP have been returning assets to customers of the
brokerage, Lehman Brothers Inc., since its parent filed the
biggest  bankruptcy  in U.S. history in September 2008 in New
York. Total charges for lawyers, accountants, services and rent
through Sept. 30 were about $420 million, the trustee said in
yesterday’s filing.  Giddens had to set up “protocols and processes for
returning property to customers, and incurred substantial
expenses in administering the largest broker dealer insolvency
in history,” Kent Jarrell, a spokesman for Giddens, said in an
e-mail today.  Fees “reflect a substantial public interest discount,” he
said.  Restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal, the liquidator of the
Lehman holding company, collected $356.4 million in fees over 24
1/2 months, out of $1 billion paid to all managers and advisers,
according to a regulatory filing this month.  Britain’s  Barclays Plc  bought the bulk of Lehman’s North
American brokerage, taking over about 72,000 of its customers
and their claims, Giddens has said.  The main bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., 08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The brokerage case is In re Securities
Investor Protection Corp. v. Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-1420, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
