Hungary’s population dropped to less
than 10 million for the first time since 1960, the country’s
 statistics office  said today.  The  population  dropped to 9,999,000 at the end of August
after accounting for the effects of immigration, the Budapest-
based statistics office said in an e-mailed statement. The
population surpassed 10 million for the first time in 1960 and
rose until 1980, statistician Ferenc Kamaras said by phone. It
has been falling since, he said.  The government is introducing tax breaks for families with
children from next year to stem the demographic decline. The
number of people under the age of 15 fell by 880,000 since 1981
while the number of those above age 60 climbed by 400,000,
Kamaras said.  “This is the first time in 50 years that we crossed below
the 10 million mark,” he said. “The problem of a dwindling
population is compounded by the fact that it is also ageing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
