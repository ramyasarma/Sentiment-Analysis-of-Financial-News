Thailand’s  SET Index (SET)  fell 12.08, or
1.2 percent, to 983.96 at the 4:30 p.m. close, the first drop in
four days.  Berli Jucker Pcl (BJC)  , a Thai trading company
controlled by billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, dropped 5.1
percent to 20.4 baht, the steepest decline since Sept. 6. The
company is still studying the possible acquisition of Carrefour
SA’s Thai assets, Berli Jucker said in a regulatory filing.  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP)  , Thailand’s
only publicly traded oil explorer, fell 1.5 percent to 168.5
baht, the most in one week. Net income in the third quarter more
than doubled to 10.5 billion baht ($350 million) because of
increased production and foreign-exchange gains. Profit was
lower than the 11.6 billion baht median estimate of 10 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  Siam Cement Pcl (SCC)  , the country’s third-largest
publicly traded company by market value, declined 2.1 percent to
323 baht, the most in three weeks. Siam Cement said third-quarter profit fell 6 percent to 6.56 billion baht as cement
prices fell and margins at its chemicals business narrowed.  Thai Vegetable Oil Pcl (TVO)  , the nation’s largest
soybean supplier, jumped 4.6 percent to 28.75 baht, a record
close. Soybeans for January delivery earlier touched $12.405 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest price for a
most-active contract since Sept. 4, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
