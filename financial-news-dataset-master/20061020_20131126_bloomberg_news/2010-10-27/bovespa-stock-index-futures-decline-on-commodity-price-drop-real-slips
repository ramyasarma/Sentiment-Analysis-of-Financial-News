The  Bovespa  stock index dropped as
state-controlled companies fell on presidential election
speculation and Banco Bradesco SA reported profits that missed
analysts’ estimates, sending financial stocks lower.  Bradesco, Brazil’s second-biggest bank by market value, led
a drop on the Bovespa index after saying adjusted net income
increased to 2.52 billion reais ($1.46 billion). Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras SA paced a decline for state-controlled
companies after a poll showed presidential candidate  Jose Serra 
falling further behind  Dilma Rousseff  to win the Oct. 31
election.  “The market thinks Serra would not tighten control of
state companies as much, so there would be a better return on
investment,” said  Eduardo Rocha , who helps manage about 1.2
billion reais at Modal Asset Management in Rio de Janeiro. “The
market anticipated a lot from Bradesco’s results.”  The Bovespa slipped 0.2 percent to 70,568.94. The
 BM&FBovespa Small Cap index  fell 0.3 percent to 1,411.34. The
real fell 1 percent to 1.7214 per dollar.  Rousseff increased her lead to 15.2 percentage points over
opposition candidate and former Sao Paulo Governor Serra, a
Sensus poll showed.  Eletrobras  Eletrobras, as the federally controlled utility is known,
slipped 1.1 percent to 28.22 reais. Support for Rousseff,
President  Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva’s former cabinet chief, rose
to 51.9 percent from 46.8 percent in the previous Sensus poll
taken Oct. 18-19. Support for Serra declined to 36.7 percent
from 41.8 percent a week before.  The poll surveyed 2,000 people from Oct. 23-25 and has a
margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. It was commissioned by
the National Transport Confederation.  Itau Unibanco Holding SA , Brazil’s biggest bank by market
value, sank 2 percent to 41.54 reais. Bradesco fell 4.5 percent
to 35.25 reais. Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time
events, increased from 1.8 billion reais a year earlier, the
Osasco, Brazil-based bank said today in a regulatory filing. The
result fell short of the mean estimate of 2.55 billion reais in
a Bloomberg survey of four analysts.  “Administrative expenses came higher than expected, and
will very likely continue to expand,” wrote BTG Pactual analyst
 Eduardo Nishio  in a note to clients. “Bradesco has already been
outperforming peers since the beginning of the year on the back
of improving results, so most of the good news has already been
priced in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
