New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia 
will have surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee,
the Major League Baseball team said in a statement.  Sabathia, 30, will have arthroscopic surgery on Oct. 29 at
New York-Presbyterian Hospital. He is expected to begin normal
preparation for next season 3-6 weeks following the surgery, the
team said.  The Yankees didn’t say in the statement when the injury
occurred, and team spokesman  Jason Zillo  didn’t immediately
return a voicemail message seeking comment.  A four-time All-Star and 2007 Cy Young Award winner,
Sabathia is two years into a seven-year, $161 million contract
with the Yankees. He was 21-7 with a 3.18 earned run average
this season, and 2-0 with a 5.63 ERA in three postseason starts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
