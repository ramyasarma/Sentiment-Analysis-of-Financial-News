Rod Blagojevich , the former Illinois
governor found guilty by a U.S. jury on one of 24 counts he
faced in a criminal corruption trial, lost a bid for acquittal
or a retrial on that charge.  U.S. District Judge  James B. Zagel  in Chicago today denied
a request by the twice-elected Democrat that he throw out the
jury’s Aug. 17 finding that Blagojevich lied to federal agents
about his knowledge of campaign fundraising. The jury deadlocked
on the other 23 counts. A retrial is set for April 20.  Jurors found the ex-governor lied when he said in a 2005
FBI interview that he “does not track or want to know, who
contributes to him or how much they are contributing to him.”  “There was no ambiguity in the statement,” Zagel said in
a two-page order denying the defense motion. “If defendant had
thought there was ambiguity, he could have requested that the
jury be instructed to decide which individual clauses, if any,
were to be found false.”  The case is U.S. v. Blagojevich, 08cr888, in U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
