Erste Group Bank AG , eastern
Europe’s second-biggest lender, may say third-quarter profit
rose as it put aside less money for bad debt and commission
income increased.  Net income probably gained to 243 million euros ($336
million) from 228 million euros a year earlier, according to the
median estimate of 13  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. The
estimates ranged from 191 million euros to 269 million euros.  Banks including Erste and  UniCredit SpA , eastern Europe’s
biggest, reported a surprise quarterly increase in bad-debt
charges in the former communist bloc for the second quarter.
Erste Chief Executive Officer  Andreas Treichl  has said
delinquent loans will start falling this year everywhere in the
region apart from Romania and Hungary.  The company is due to report results on Oct. 29 at
7:30 a.m. in Vienna. The following is a table of the analysts’
estimates. The figures are in millions of euros.  The following banks participated in the survey: Atlantik
Financial Markets, UBS, Societe Generale, Cyrrus, UniCredit,
Raiffeisen, Kepler Capital Markets, KBC Securities, Concorde
Securities, S&P Equity Research, Citigroup, CA Cheuvreux,
Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Mediobanca.  To contact the reporter on this story:
