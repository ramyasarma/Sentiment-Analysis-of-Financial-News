Jones Group Inc. , the maker of Nine
West shoes, slumped the most in almost two years after lowering
sales projections for 2010 and posting third-quarter profit that
missed some analysts’ estimates.  Total revenue for this year will range from $3.62 billion
to $3.67 billion, Chief Financial Officer  John McClain  said
today in a conference call with analysts after the company
reported third-quarter results. In July the company said sales
would be as much as $3.7 billion.  New York-based Jones Group, led by Chief Executive Officer
 Wesley Card,  operates 834 stores in North America. Third-quarter
profit excluding some one-time items was 54 cents a share in the
quarter ended Oct. 4. Analysts anticipated 62 cents, the average
of 8 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Jones Group sank $4.29, or 22 percent, to $15.23 at 4:01
p.m. today in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the
largest drop since November 2008. The shares have fallen 5.2
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
