UniCredit SpA  will seek the
“right” mix of stable shareholders in different regions in the
future, Chief Executive Officer Federico Ghizzoni told la
Repubblica in an interview.  Ghizzoni told the daily he doesn’t think the bank’s Libyan
shareholders are reconsidering their investment.  UniCredit doesn’t need to raise new capital at this stage,
Ghizzoni said, and it’s expecting to pay a dividend in 2010.  The executive said he doesn’t see the need for the bank to
make changes to its holdings, including its stake in  Mediobanca
SpA , according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
