Dubai World secured approval from
all creditors for its $24.9 billion debt restructuring plan,
according to a company official.  The backing from creditors is likely to speed up the
process of closing the restructuring deal, said the official,
who didn’t want to be identified because of company policy.  The Financial Times reported today that Aurelius Capital
Management sold $5 million outstanding Dubai World liabilities
to Deutsche Bank AG. Dubai World announced Sept. 10 that
creditors holding more than 99 percent of the value of its loans
approved its debt restructuring plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
