Mubadala Development Co., an Abu
Dhabi government investment unit, wants to expand in emerging
markets over the coming years as the company diversifies its
investments.  A “gaping hole is going to be addressed in the next two or
three or four years and it’s about emerging market exposure,”
Chief Operating Officer  Waleed Al Mokarrab Al Muhairi  said today
at the World Economic Forum in Marrakesh, Morocco.  Mubadala has an $8 billion joint venture with General
Electric Co. in emerging markets, and a stake in California-
based semiconductors maker  Advanced Micro Devices Inc . Mubadala
said in August it may buy assets from BP Plc after the company
lost half its value following the worst oil spill in U.S.
history.  The sovereign investment company said on Oct. 8 that it’s
exploring a possible $7 billion aluminum project in Malaysia’s
eastern Sarawak state. Mubadala’s Chief Executive Officer
Khaldoon Al Mubarak discussed investment opportunities with
Saudi  Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal ’s Kingdom Holding Co., Kingdom
said in June.  Mubadala sees opportunities in India, China, Thailand and
Vietnam, Al Muhairi said. “We have no geographical
restrictions,” he said. ‘’We always want to find the best
return.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
