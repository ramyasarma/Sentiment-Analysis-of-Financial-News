The law firm advising Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s brokerage trustee was paid $107.8
million for two years’ work liquidating the remains of the
broker dealer, according to a court filing yesterday.  Trustee James Giddens and the law firm Hughes Hubbard &
Reed LLP have been returning assets to customers of the defunct
brokerage, Lehman Brothers Inc., since its parent filed the
biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
