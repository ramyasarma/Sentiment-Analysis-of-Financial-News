(Corrects Indian population in 2nd paragraph of story
published Oct. 27.)  India’s Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said he will ask the central bank to learn more about
Islamic finance from Malaysia, which has the world’s biggest
market for Shariah-compliant debt, or sukuk.  There is no regulated Islamic finance market in India,
where Muslims make up about 138 million, or 13 percent, of the 1
billion population, according to the government’s 2001  census . A
panel headed by Raghuram Rajan, a finance professor at the
University of Chicago and former chief economist at the
International Monetary Fund, recommended in 2008 that India
introduce Islamic banking to attract more capital.  “There have been, from time to time, demands that we
should experiment with Islamic banking and I will recommend to
the Reserve Bank of India to look at what’s happening in
Malaysia,” Singh said in Kuala Lumpur today.  In Malaysia, 60 percent of the 28 million people are Muslim
and Islamic banking assets amount to 337.6 billion ringgit ($109
billion), or 20 percent of the total, the Finance Ministry said
in its 2010-2011 economic report Oct. 15.  Sukuk pay asset returns to comply with the religion’s ban
on interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
