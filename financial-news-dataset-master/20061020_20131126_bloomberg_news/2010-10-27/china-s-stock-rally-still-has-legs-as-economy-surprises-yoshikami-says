This month’s rally in China’s stocks
“still has legs” as the nation’s economic growth exceeds
expectations, according to Michael Yoshikami, who oversees about
$1 billion at YCMNet Advisors.  The 14 percent rally for the Shanghai Composite Index in
October has been “pretty incredible,” Yoshikami, who is based
in Walnut Creek, California, said in a phone interview today.
“While it can’t continue to rally as we have seen, it still has
legs at the moment.”   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
