General Motors Co.’s  Chevrolet will
introduce its new ad campaign, “Chevy Runs Deep,” with four
spots during the World Series baseball game tonight to emphasize
the brand’s role in American culture  The new campaign was created by Goodby, Silverstein &
Partners, Detroit-based GM said today.  Joel Ewanick , GM’s vice
president of marketing, hired San Francisco-based Goodby in May.  The first ads will seek to build momentum for GM’s brands
more than a year after the company emerged from  bankruptcy .
Chevy accounts for about 70 percent of GM’s sales. New Chief
Executive Officer  Dan Akerson  has taken an interest in the ad
strategy, Ewanick said today.  “This is the beginning of turning around the way people
look at Chevrolet,” Ewanick said today at a press conference in
Detroit. “It’s one of the keys to a resurgence at General
Motors.”  GM’s 2011 advertising budget will be slightly more than the
roughly $2.5 billion the company spent in 2008, Ewanick said.  The World Series is a best-of-seven game contest to
determine the champion of Major League Baseball.  To contact the reporter on this story:
