Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. ,
China’s second-largest insurer, said profit fell 26 percent
as claims rose and the company set aside greater reserves.  Third-quarter  net income  dropped to 3.15 billion yuan ($471
million), or 0.41 yuan a share, from a revised 4.25 billion
yuan, or 0.58 yuan, a year earlier, Ping An said in a Shanghai
stock exchange filing yesterday. Profit for the first nine
months rose 8.8 percent to 12.8 billion yuan.  Ping An set aside 16.3 billion yuan in insurance reserves
last quarter, double the amount a year earlier, because a lower
yield curve means more funds are needed to cover future claims,
according to the statement.  “The decrease in total investment income of equity
assets” weighed on earnings, as did an increase in insurance
reserves for claims, the statement said. “Market uncertainties
will put pressure on our fourth quarter results”  Still, the company had 581 million yuan in fair-value
investment gains as the  Shanghai Composite Index  rallied 11
percent, reversing a 222 million yuan charge a year earlier.  Net premiums earned rose 35 percent to 31.2 billion yuan.
Claims climbed 9 percent to 9.7 billion yuan.  Ping An  fell 3 percent to HK$84.15 in Hong Kong yesterday,
before the earnings, compared with the 1.9 percent decline in
the Hang Seng Index. The stock has risen 24 percent this year,
compared with the benchmark’s 5.9 percent gain.  -- Zhang Dingmin , with assistance from  Wang Ying . Editors:
