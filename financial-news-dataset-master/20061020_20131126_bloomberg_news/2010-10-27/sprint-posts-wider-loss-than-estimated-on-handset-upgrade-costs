Sprint Nextel Corp.  fell the most in
more than a year after missing analysts’ earnings estimates as
the company subsidized the cost of mobile phones for customers
using its new wireless network.  The third-quarter loss was 30 cents a share, the Overland
Park, Kansas-based carrier said today in a statement. Analysts
projected a loss of 28 cents, the average of  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Its shares fell as much as 12 percent, the largest
intraday decline since Feb. 10.  Sprint  expanded its so-called fourth-generation network to
20 new markets in the quarter, bringing the total to 56, as it
works to lure customers to lucrative two-year data contracts.
The wireless carrier, the third-largest in the U.S., takes on
some of the cost of a new handset in exchange for the contract.  “The large take rate of 4G handsets, and the subsidies
which come with this, has continued to weigh on margins,” said
 Jennifer Fritzsche , a Wells Fargo & Co. analyst in Chicago. She
rates Sprint “outperform.”  The net loss widened to $911 million from $478 million, or
17 cents, a year earlier. The results include a $365 million, or
12 cents per share, non-cash charge for an increased tax
allowance, Sprint said.  Sales  rose for the first time since the second quarter of
2007, to $8.15 billion from $8.04 billion. Analysts estimated
$8.01 billion on average.  Sprint fell 47 cents, or 9.9 percent, to $4.30 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the biggest decline
since July 2009. The shares have added 17 percent this year.  Churn Declines  Sprint lost 107,000 contract subscribers in the quarter,
compared with 801,000 a year earlier. The carrier added 471,000
customers without contracts, known as prepaid, down from growth
of 666,000 a year earlier. Barclays Capital Inc. analyst  James Ratcliffe  predicted Sprint would lose 100,000 contract
subscribers, known as postpaid, and add 225,000 prepaid users.  “Although we incurred costs to bring new customers to our
network, it is money well spent,” said Chief Financial Officer
 Bob Brust  on a conference call. “An important factor in turning
around the company’s financial performance is growing our
customer base.”  Churn, or the rate at which customers left, fell to 1.93
percent from 2.17 percent among contract customers and to 5.32
percent from 6.65 percent for non-contract customers.  AT&T Inc. 
and Verizon Wireless last week reported postpaid churn of 1.14
percent and 1.07 percent, respectively.  Verizon and AT&T said they added 584,000 and 745,000
contract subscribers last quarter, respectively. Postpaid
customers are more valuable to carriers because they are locked
in to two-year contracts.  Verizon Wireless, the largest mobile-phone carrier, will
begin offering its own 4G service in nearly 40 markets by year-
end, many of them sites already served by Sprint. AT&T has said
it will offer the service by mid-2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
