The International Finance Corp., the
World Bank’s private-investment arm, is likely to increase its
investments in sub-Saharan Africa in the fiscal year through
June 2011, Chief Executive Officer  Lars Thunell  said.  The IFC invested $2.2 billion in Africa last year and “I
am sure we are going to do more in our fiscal year 2011,”
Thunell said today in an interview at the World Economic Forum
in Marrakesh, Morocco.  The economies of the region are projected to grow 5 percent
this year, the International Monetary Fund said in its October
outlook. Next year, growth is expected to reach 5.5 percent,
according to the Washington-based lender.  World output growth will probably weaken to 4.2 percent in
2011 from 4.8 percent in 2010, the International Monetary Fund
said on Oct. 6. The euro-region economy may expand 1.7 percent
this year and 1.5 percent in 2011, it said.  The IFC plans to focus on investing in the financial sector
and small-and-medium enterprises, Thunell said.  The institution will also invest in agriculture. The
investments will be in “everything from farm to fork, in other
words the whole supply chain including the food processing,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
