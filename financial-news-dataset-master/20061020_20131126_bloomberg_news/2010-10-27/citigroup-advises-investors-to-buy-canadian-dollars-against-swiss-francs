Investors should buy Canada’s dollar
against the Swiss franc as the loonie will benefit from any
gains by its U.S. peer, while being insulated by higher oil
prices should the dollar weaken, Citigroup Inc. said.  Citigroup put a target of 99.80 centimes per loonie in two
weeks, currency strategists including London-based  Valentin Marinov  wrote in a report today. Marinov and colleague  Greg Anderson  recommended exiting the trade should the franc
appreciate to 94.30 centimes per loonie.  “We are reluctant to go short euro-dollar outright given
continued strong central bank demand for euros, but we like the
idea of shorting a proxy where there is no such floor,” the
analysts wrote. “Long Canadian dollar-franc has the added
benefit of performing well during bouts of rising commodity
prices on the back of dollar weakness. If dollar weakness
reasserts, oil prices should also rally and lift” the Canadian
currency, they wrote.  Canada’s dollar was little changed at 96.17 Swiss centimes
at 10:30 a.m. in London. The currencies last traded at parity in
August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
