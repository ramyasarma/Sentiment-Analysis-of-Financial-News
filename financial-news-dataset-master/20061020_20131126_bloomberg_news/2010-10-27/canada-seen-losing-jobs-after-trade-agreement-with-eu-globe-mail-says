A draft free-trade pact between
Canada and the European Union might lead to the loss of 28,000
Canadian jobs, the Globe & Mail reported, citing a study by
economist Jim Stanford that will be published today.  If tariffs were scrapped, the main impact would be felt in
Canadian manufacturing, above all in food processing, the
clothing industry and car companies, according to the study, the
newspaper said.  Canada has run an average deficit of $19 billion on its
trade with the EU in the past 10 years, the Globe & Mail said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
