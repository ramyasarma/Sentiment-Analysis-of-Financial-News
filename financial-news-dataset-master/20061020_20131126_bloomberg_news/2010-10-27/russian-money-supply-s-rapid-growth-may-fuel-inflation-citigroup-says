Russia’s money supply continued its
“rapid” expansion last month, threatening to sustain fast
 inflation  through next year, Citigroup Inc. said.  Money supply  growth of more than 30 percent in September is
set to push up annual inflation to 9.2 percent at the end of the
year and 7.6 percent in 2011, Moscow-based economists Elina
Ribakova and Natalia Novikova wrote in a research note today.  “Growing producer costs and the acceleration of money
supply growth will add to inflationary pressures from the end of
2010 and into 2011,” the note said. “However, we expect the
central bank will remain under pressure not to increase rates in
order to support a greater issuance of government bonds.”  Inflation  accelerated for a second month in September to  7
percent after the country’s worst drought in at least half a
century hobbled agricultural output and pushed up food prices.
The central bank left its main interest rates unchanged last
month, saying “inflationary risks, shaped by monetary
conditions, are at an acceptable level.”  Money supply expanded at an annual rate of more than 30
percent every month for the past seven months, rising 31.2
percent in September, according to Bank Rossii data. The ruble
weakened 0.6 percent to 30.57 versus the dollar at 10:51 am in
Moscow today.  “We are concerned that, without a significant
appreciation, pressure on the ruble and a weak interest rate
transmission mechanism, inflation will remain elevated in
2011,” Ribakova and Novikova said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
