AZ Electronic Materials, a chemical
maker partly owned by private-equity firm Carlyle Group, has
increased its initial public offering in London to $700 million
from $500 million, the terms for the sale show.  The company is selling $400 million of new shares. Its
existing shareholders are offering $300 million of shares,
including the over-allotment option. Previously, the
shareholders planned to raise about $100 million, according to
the termsheet obtained by Bloomberg News.  Carlyle and co-owner Vestar Capital Partners are each
selling $137 million and AZ’s management plans to sell a further
$26 million, the terms show. Carlyle and Vestar will each retain
a stake of about 21.4 percent in the company, according to the
terms.  The IPO is Carlyle’s first in Europe since it sold shares
in Transics NV, a Belgian maker of vehicle-tracking devices, in
2007. Private-equity firms have struggled to sell assets in IPOs
after the financial crisis wiped out demand for new stock.
London-based Permira Advisers LLP dropped its planned IPO of
retailer New Look Group Ltd. in February. Permira cited
unfavorable market conditions.  Carlyle paid about 518 million Swiss francs ($525.6
million) to buy AZ from specialty chemical maker Clariant in
2004. Vestar purchased a stake in the company from Washington-
based Carlyle in 2007.  AZ is scheduled to start conditional trading on Oct. 29.
Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG are
managing the IPO.  Over-allotment options allow underwriters to purchase
additional shares at the original IPO price after the stock
starts trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
