Greek bonds fell for a third day as
Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  highlighted tax issues
as key problems facing government efforts to reduce the nation’s
budget deficit.  The declines pushed the  yield  on the 10-year bond to the
highest in more than three weeks. Papaconstantinou, speaking at
a conference in Limassol, Cyprus, said Greece has “serious tax
compliance issues” and that a Greek tax amnesty is “a break
with the past.” Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said
Oct. 7 his government inherited a deficit that was “close to 15
percent” of gross domestic product last year.  “The tax problems highlight event risk for Greek bonds,”
said  Harvinder Sian , a senior bond strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc in London. “The country functions with zero
appetite to pay tax, and the authorities are looking to change
this. Papaconstantinou is drawing a line in the sand, and wants
better compliance from now on.”  The yield on the 10-year Greek bond rose 48 basis points to
10.24 percent as of 10:33 a.m. in London. That’s the most since
Sept. 30, based on closing levels. The 6.25 percent security
maturing in June 2020 fell 2.44, or 24.4 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,382) face amount, to 76.105.  The extra yield investors demand to  hold  Greek 10-year debt
instead of bunds rose by 34 basis points to 749 basis points,
the most since Oct. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
