Renault SA , France’s second-largest
carmaker, said third-quarter sales rose 7.6 percent because of
growth in emerging markets such as Russia, Brazil and Argentina.  Revenue increased to 8.71 billion euros ($12 billion) from
8.1 billion euros a year earlier, Boulogne Billancourt-based
Renault said today in a statement. Revenue beat the 8.65
billion-euro average  estimate  of six analysts.  “The European market was better than expected in the third
quarter,”  Jerome Stoll , Renault’s sales chief, said on a call
with analysts and reporters. The carmaker trimmed its forecast
for Europe’s full-year auto-market contraction to 5 percent from
its previous estimate of 7 percent.  Third-quarter deliveries increased 5.7 percent to 591,855
vehicles, outpacing the global market’s 4.6 percent expansion,
Renault said. A 41 percent surge in Latin American sales led the
gains, followed by a 37 percent jump in the Eurasia region
including Russia, where the government is offering sales
incentives.  Automotive revenue gained 7.9 percent to 8.27 billion euros
in the quarter, while the sales-financing division recorded a
1.1 percent increase to 443 million euros, Renault said.  While raising his global auto-market growth forecast to 9
percent from 8 percent gain for 2010, Stoll said pricing was
under increasing competitive pressure in Renault’s home  region .  “The European contest is getting more aggressive and we
are defending our market shares,” Stoll said, adding that
Renault is ready to cut prices to keep business.  “We don’t want to be price leaders but we’re following
competitors and doing just enough not to lose market share,” he
said. “Conquering a new customer costs more than retaining
one.”  Free  cash flow  will amount to about 700 million euros in
the full year, compared with 1.42 billion euros recorded for the
first half alone, the company said, implying negative cash flow
of 720 million euros in the last six months.  Renault  fell  1.29 euros, or 3.1 percent, to 40.62 euros at
the 5:30 p.m. close of Paris trading, before the carmaker
published the sales figures. The stock has  gained  12 percent
this year, valuing the company at 12 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
