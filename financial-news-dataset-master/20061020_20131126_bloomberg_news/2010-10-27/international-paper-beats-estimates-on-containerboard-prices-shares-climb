International Paper Co. , the world’s
largest paper and pulp maker, reported third-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ projections as containerboard prices increased on
higher demand for shipping boxes.  Net income  rose to $397 million, or 91 cents a share, from
$371 million, or 87 cents, a year earlier, Memphis, Tennessee-
based International Paper said today in a statement. That topped
the 79-cent  average estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  John Faraci  is benefiting from a
rebound in prices and demand for containerboard, the specialized
paper used to make shipping boxes, following the economic
slowdown of 2008 and 2009. Growth in demand and expansion of
profit margins may continue into 2011, Faraci said on a
conference call with investors and analysts.  “We don’t see 2010 as a mid-cycle demand environment in
our biggest market, which is North America,” Faraci said on the
call. “The box business is a good example of why we see it that
way.”  International Paper rose $1.19, or 5 percent, to $25.06 at
10:54 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after
earlier rising as much as 5.5 percent to $25.18.  The shares 
declined 11 percent this year before today.  North American Earnings  International Paper’s North American industrial-packaging
operations posted record quarterly earnings, partly because of
price increases for boxes and the linerboard used to make them, the
company said in the statement.  North American demand for cardboard packaging is up 6
percent from the low point during the recession, though it
remains 4 percent below pre-recession levels of early 2008,
Faraci said on the call.  The company’s  worldwide sales  in the quarter increased 14
percent to $6.72 billion from $5.92 billion, beating the $6.56
billion average of nine analyst estimates in the Bloomberg
survey.  “The key drivers are higher prices across the paper
grades, demand growth and supply management,”  Joshua Zaret , a
New York-based analyst at Longbow Research, said in an interview
before the results were released. “Quarter on quarter, we’re
also seeing lower costs for wood fiber and OCC,” or  old-
cardboard containers , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
