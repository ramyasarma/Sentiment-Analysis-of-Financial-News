OneWest Bank, formed in the
aftermath of IndyMac Bancorp’s failure, hired  Joseph Otting  from
 U.S. Bancorp  as president and chief executive officer.  Otting, who led U.S. Bancorp’s expansion in California,
will also join OneWest’s board, the bank said today in a
statement. He was head of commercial banking and one of eight
vice chairmen at U.S. Bancorp, the fifth biggest U.S. lender,
according to  Steve Dale , a spokesman for the Minneapolis-based
bank.  “Joseph’s background, knowledge of the market, client
relationships and leadership capabilities made him uniquely
qualified for this position,”  Steven Mnuchin , chairman of
Pasadena, California-based OneWest, said in the statement.  Previously, Otting was with Union Bank in California for 16
years, where he was an executive vice president and head of
commercial banking, according to the statement.  “We wish him well in his new endeavors,” Dale said of
Otting in a telephone interview.  Terry Laughlin  stepped down as OneWest’s CEO in June to
join Bank of America Corp., where he was reunited with longtime
colleague  Brian T. Moynihan , CEO of the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based bank.  OneWest is the successor to IndyMac Bancorp, which was
seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 2008 at an
estimated cost of $10.7 billion. The FDIC has since used OneWest
to absorb other failed California lenders.  OneWest has 82 retail branches in Southern California and
assets of $28 billion, according today’s statement. IndyMac
Mortgage Services, one of its divisions, services more than $150
billion of mortgage loans for third parties.  To contact the reporters on this story:
