Former Canadian Prime Minister  Paul Martin  said BHP Billiton Ltd.’s $40 billion hostile offer for
 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  needs careful scrutiny after
the provincial government objected to the sale.  “The government of Saskatchewan has spoken,” Martin said
in a Bloomberg Television interview in London today. “People
have got to give full consideration to what Saskatchewan is
saying.”  The federal government can block the transaction if it
finds it doesn’t provide a “net benefit” to the country.
Canada has until Nov. 3 to complete a review of the bid, unless
Melbourne-based BHP, the world’s largest mining company, agrees
to an extension.  Saskatchewan’s energy minister  Bill Boyd  said in an
interview yesterday Canada should block the BHP bid because it
fails the net benefit test and there is no need for any new
discussions with the company. Potash Corp., based in Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan, has rejected BHP’s $130-a-share offer as too low
and said it was seeking alternatives amid rising prices for
agricultural commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
