Lan Airlines SA , which yesterday
reported a doubling of third-quarter profit, plans to invest
$7.72 billion through 2018 to more than double its fleet as
Latin American passenger and cargo traffic recovers.  The region’s biggest carrier by market value will invest
$1.15 billion next year, from $424 million this year, and
increase its aircraft to 222 in the next eight years, according
to a presentation published on its website.  The Santiago-based airline’s passenger capacity probably
will grow by 15 percent to 17 percent next year while cargo
capacity is set to expand as much as 15 percent, it wrote after
reporting quarterly net income of $106 million compared with
$52.1 million a year ago. The average estimate of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of $107 million.  Lan’s  shares  rose 0.3 percent to a record 14,970 pesos at
9:14 a.m. New York time in Santiago trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
