Futures trading on the Australian
stock exchange has resumed after an earlier outage.  “The issue with the futures has been resolved and the
system’s been reconnected,” ASX Ltd. spokesman Matthew Gibbs
said by telephone earlier.  Trading was disrupted about 90 seconds after a statistics
bureau announcement on consumer prices at 11:30 a.m., Gibbs
said, citing an issue with the matching of trades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
