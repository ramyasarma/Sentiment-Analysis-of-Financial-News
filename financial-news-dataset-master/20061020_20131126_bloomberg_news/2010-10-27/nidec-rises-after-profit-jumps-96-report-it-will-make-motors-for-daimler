Nidec Corp.  surged after posting an
increase in first-half profit and raising its full-year sales
forecast. The Nikkei newspaper also reported the company is
making motors for Mercedes-Benz electric and fuel cell vehicles.  The shares advanced 6.9 percent to 7,700  yen  as of 11 a.m.
on the Osaka Securities Exchange, headed for the biggest gain
since April 30, 2009. The benchmark  Topix  index rose 0.5 percent.  Net income almost doubled to 27 billion yen ($331 million)
in the six months ended Sept. 30, from 13.8 billion yen a year
earlier, Nidec said yesterday in a statement to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The Kyoto-based company is the world’s biggest maker
of motors for hard-disk drives.  Nidec, which said sales jumped 27 percent to 340.8 billion
yen in the period, raised its full-year revenue forecast 6.1
percent to 700 billion yen, and targets 2 trillion yen annual
sales by March 2016.  The Nikkei newspaper reported overnight Nidec has started
producing motors in the U.S. for use in Daimler AG’s Mercedes-
Benz’s electric and fuel cell vehicles as part of its push to
expand beyond its precision motor business.  Nidec, which supplies hard drive makers  Seagate Technology
Plc  and  Western Digital Corp.  with brushless motors, last month
completed its purchase of  Emerson Electric Co. ’s motor and
controls business to expand its home appliance and automobile
operations in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
