Mexican central bank Governor
 Agustin Carstens  cut his inflation forecast for the next two
quarters, saying the country was experiencing only “moderate”
wage increases and limited external pressure on prices.  The slowdown in inflation will allow the central bank to
cut the number of policy meetings it will hold next year to
eight from 11, Carstens told reporters today as he presented the
bank’s quarterly inflation report. Policy makers will also begin
publishing minutes of their meetings.  “As inflation has continued to get closer to our
forecasts, there is a growing feeling or urgency for the bank to
have fewer meetings,” Carstens said in Mexico City.  The economy will grow 5 percent this year, at the upper end
of the bank’s previous forecast, as it recovers from the biggest
contraction in seven decades last year, Carstens said. The
economy is benefitting from increasing exports as muted domestic
demand keeps consumer-price inflation at bay.  The Bank of Mexico predicts consumer prices will climb 4.25
percent to 4.75 percent in the fourth quarter, down from as high
as 5.25 percent in the previous estimate published in July.
Inflation will be 3.75 percent to 4.25 percent in the first
quarter of 2011, a 0.75-percentage point reduction from the
previous estimate. The bank cut the lower end of its second-
quarter inflation estimate to 3 percent from 3.5 percent, while
keeping the upper end of the forecast at 4 percent.  Inflation will converge on the bank’s 3 percent target
beginning in the second half of next year, Carstens said.  Production, Prices  “We have not observed important pressures on prices,”
Carstens said. “We have seen moderate increases in wages and
there is unused installed capacity, which allows us to increase
production without pressuring prices.”  Carstens predicted third-quarter economic growth was 5
percent. Mexico will create 575,000 to 675,000 new jobs this
year, and 500,000 to 600,000 next year, Carstens said.  The peso fell 0.3 percent to 12.4564 per dollar at 4:35
p.m. New York time from 12.4136 yesterday.  Mexican  consumer prices  remained below central bank
forecasts of 4.75 percent to 5.25 percent every month of the
third quarter, with an annual inflation rate of 3.7 percent in
September. Annual inflation quickened to 3.89 percent in the
first half of October.  The central bank will begin increasing the benchmark
interest rate in September 2011, according to a survey of
economists by Citigroup Inc.’s local Banamex unit. The inflation
rate will be 4.3 percent at the end of this year and the economy
will grow 4.65 percent in 2010, the survey said.  Rate Pause  The bank this month kept its  benchmark interest rate 
unchanged for a 14th straight meeting, the longest pause on
record.  Carstens said the bank won’t include the names of board
members in its minutes, which will be published 10 days after
policy meetings are held.  Mexico’s central bank forecasts a $5.1 billion trade
deficit in 2010, and a current account gap of $6.5 billion this
year, according to the report.  “We are in a situation where we can say we have come out
of the crisis and done it successfully, especially because
inflation stayed below our forecast ranges,” Carstens said.  Latin America’s second-biggest economy is recovering from a
6.5 percent contraction last year, the biggest slump since 1932.  To contact the reporter on this story:
