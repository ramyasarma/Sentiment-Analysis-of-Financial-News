Argentina stocks  rose the most in
two years in New York trading as some investors speculated the
death of former President  Nestor Kirchner  will lead to a more-
stable economy and reduced government spending.  The MSCI Argentina Index gained 10 percent to 3,458.64 at
10:58 a.m. New York time. It rallied as much as 13 percent, the
steepest intraday advance since Nov. 24, 2008. Grupo Financiero
Galicia SA, the South American country’s biggest consumer
lender, surged as much as 26 percent.  Kirchner, who handed power to his wife  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  in 2007, died after suffering a heart attack, C5N
television network reported today. Investors are buying
Argentine American depositary receipts on prospects that “the
Kirchner era” of high inflation fueled by public spending and
low corporate investment may end, said  Greg Lesko , who helps
manage $750 million at Deltec Asset Management in New York.  “Stocks are going nuts,” Lesko said by telephone. “There
is no guarantee that the next person will be any better but
change is what the market has been wanting.”  Argentina markets, closed today for a public holiday,
probably will rally as Kirchner was perceived as an obstacle to
investment,  Guillermo Mondino , head of Latin America research at
Barclays Capital in New York, said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
