Saipem SpA, Europe’s largest oil-
field services contractor, rose in Milan trading after reporting
a 24 percent increase in quarterly profit and saying rising
orders may allow it to beat 2010 financial targets.  Third-quarter profit rose to 211 million euros ($291
million) from 170 million euros a year earlier, the Milan-based
company said today. That beat the 193 million-euro average
estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue gained 11
percent to 2.82 billion euros.  Saipem said orders in the quarter advanced 36 percent to
2.56 billion euros, moving it closer to surpassing its targets
for this year. Earnings were helped by increased onshore
business in North and West Africa and by its drilling business,
the company said.  “The high level of backlog and strong operational
performance from contracts under execution enable the management
to forecast that improved expectations for 2010, announced upon
the release of half-year results will be met,” the company said
in a statement. These were for sales to rise 5 percent and for a
“slight increase” in net profit, the company said.  The  shares rose  as much as 2.5 percent, and traded up 41
cents at 31.77 euros as of 4:04 p.m. in Milan, giving Saipem a
value of 14 billion euros.  The company has orders for 2.41 billion for the fourth-
quarter and 8.2 billion for 2011, according to the statement.  Saipem also said it completed the sale of a 40 percent
stake in French company Doris Engineering SA for a profit of 17
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
