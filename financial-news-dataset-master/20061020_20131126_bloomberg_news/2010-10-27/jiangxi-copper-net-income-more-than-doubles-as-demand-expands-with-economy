Jiangxi Copper Co. , China’s biggest
producer of the metal, said third-quarter profit more than
doubled as economic growth boosted demand and prices.  Net income  rose to 1.28 billion yuan ($192 million), or
0.42 yuan a share, from 561 million yuan, or 0.16 yuan, a year
earlier, the Guixi, Jiangxi province-based company said in a
Shanghai stock exchange filing today. Sales climbed 50 percent
to 19.6 billion yuan.  China’s gross domestic product grew 9.6 percent last
quarter, the smallest gain in a year, as inflation in September
accelerated to the fastest pace in 23 months. Prices of copper,
used in wires and cables, rose more than 23 percent in Shanghai
from a year earlier.  Full-year profit may increase more than 50 percent from the
previous year if copper prices hold, the company said.  Jiangxi Copper  fell 4.4 percent to HK$21.75 at the 4 p.m.
close of trading in Hong Kong. The stock fell 3.8 percent to
45.16 yuan in Shanghai. The earnings were released after the
markets closed.  Copper futures in Shanghai averaged 56,704.10 yuan a metric
ton in the quarter, compared with 45,990.10 yuan a ton a year
earlier. Gold spot prices reached a record $1,387.35 an ounce on
