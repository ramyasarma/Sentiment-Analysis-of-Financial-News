Most Japanese  stocks  fell, led by
banks and brokerages, as the Wall Street Journal said the scale
of U.S. Federal Reserve asset purchases may be less than
anticipated. Exporters gained as the yen weakened.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s largest bank
by market value, retreated 1.8 percent. Nomura Holdings Inc.,
Japan’s No. 1 brokerage, lost 1.1 percent. JX Holdings Inc.,
Japan’s largest oil refiner, dropped 1.7 percent after crude oil
prices fell. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker,
advanced 1.5 percent. Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets more
than 80 percent of its revenue outside Japan, gained 1.9 percent.  “Shares declined on speculation the size of the U.S.
monetary-easing measures will be smaller than expected,” said
 Hideaki Higashi , strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co.
“Concerns increased that the amount of money in the markets
will be smaller and that may slow the speed of gains in the
stock market.”  The  Topix  index fell 0.18 point, or less than 0.1 percent,
to 817.76 at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo, with about eight
stocks falling for every seven that gained. The gauge rose as
much as 0.6 percent and fell as much as 0.6 percent. The Nikkei
225 Stock Average increased 0.1 percent to 9,387.03 after
sliding as much as 0.5 percent.  “As hopes for Japanese stocks are shrinking, shares tend
to react to negative factors more easily than they react to
positive news,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee about
$17 billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co.
in Tokyo.  Easing Measures  The Topix has declined 9.9 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 6.3 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 5.1
percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Japanese
benchmark are valued at an average of 14.6 times estimated
 earnings , compared with 14.1 times for the S&P 500 and 12.3
times for the Stoxx 600.  The Federal Reserve is likely to offer a program of U.S.
Treasury-bond purchases worth a few hundred billion dollars over
several months at its next meeting, the Wall Street Journal
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  Estimates for the ultimate size of the asset-purchase
program ranged from $1 trillion at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Global Research to $2 trillion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., with
economists at both firms agreeing the Fed will likely start by
announcing $500 billion after the Nov. 2-3 meeting.  Banks, Brokerages Drop  Mitsubishi UFJ lost 1.8 percent to 373 yen and Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest bank by
market value, sank 0.9 percent to 2,380 yen.  Financial stocks also declined ahead of AIA Group Ltd.’s
listing in the Hong Kong market. New York-based American
International Group Inc.’s main Asian unit is scheduled to start
official trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Oct. 29.  “Some people are probably selling financial companies’
shares in order to keep enough funds to buy AIA stock,” SMBC’s
Higashi said.  Nomura dropped 1.1 percent to 432 yen and Daiwa Securities
Group Inc., the second-biggest brokerage, slumped 2.6 percent to
332 yen.  Trading volume  on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first
section totaled 1.74 billion shares today, compared with a daily
average of 1.95 billion.  “As market volume remains low, we cannot expect an
increase in securities-transactions fees at brokerages,” Toyota
Asset’s Hamasaki said.  Exporters Lead Gains  JX Holdings fell 1.7 percent to 476 yen and Inpex Corp.,
Japan’s biggest oil-explorer, slid 0.3 percent to 436,500 yen as
crude oil futures for December delivery dropped as much as 30
cents to $82.25 in electronic trading in New York today.  Makers of cars and electronic products which rely on
overseas sales were the  biggest support  for the Topix throughout
the day. Toyota Motor advanced 1.5 percent to 2,910 yen and
Honda climbed 1.9 percent to 2,960 yen. Fanuc Ltd., Japan’s No.
1 maker of industrial robots which derives almost 80 percent of
its revenue outside the nation, gained 1 percent to 11,230 yen.  The yen depreciated to as low as 81.77 against the dollar
today, the weakest level since Oct. 21, compared with 80.68 at
yesterday’s close of stock trading. A weaker yen boosts the
value of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency.  Yen, Exporters  The yen appreciated to 80.41 against the dollar on Oct. 25,
the highest level since April 1995. It is headed for its
strongest annual average level since currencies began trading
freely in 1971, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
based on each day’s closing price.  “Exporters are leading gains as the yen paused in its
strengthening,” said  Naoteru Teraoka , general manager at the
investment unit of Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset?Management Co.,
which oversees about $26 billion. “Earnings for the past period
were strong, but people want to know how much companies are
prepared for the impact of the yen’s appreciation on their
earnings.”  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the maker of Subaru cars,
surged 5.3 percent to 555 yen,  the second-largest increase in
the Nikkei 225 . The company had 44 billion yen ($540 million) in
first-half net income, beating its 23 billion yen profit outlook
on higher sales and lower costs, according to a preliminary
earnings statement. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
& Co. raised their 12-month share-price estimates.  Earnings Peak  “The scale of the first-half profit revision appears to be
a positive surprise versus expectations,”  Kurt Sanger , an
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a report dated yesterday.
Sanger said the company’s first-half profit exceeded his
estimate and that Fuji Heavy will likely revise its full-year
forecast.  Oct. 29 is the  peak day  for earnings reports in Japan, with
272 of the 1,662 companies in the Topix scheduled to report
results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors still want to see the results of corporate
earnings, which will increase toward the end of this week, so
buying momentum will be limited,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an
equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  To contact the reporters for this story:
