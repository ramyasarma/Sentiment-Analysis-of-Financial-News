South Africa scrapped plans to issue
bonds denominated in foreign currency this fiscal year and more
than halved its estimate for 2011-12 as the budget deficit
narrows and it attempts to weaken the rand.  The government won’t raise money abroad in the year through
March after forecasting in February it would issue 14.4 billion
rand ($2.05 billion) in bonds, the  National Treasury  said in its
medium-term budget released in Cape Town today. It will raise
7.58 billion rand abroad next year, compared with a previous
estimate of 17.3 billion rand.  The rand has strengthened 34 percent against the dollar
since the start of 2009, boosted by capital flows from investors
lured by higher interest rates in Africa’s biggest  economy .
Reducing international bond sales will help ease pressure on the
rand, adding to the continued purchases of foreign currency in
the domestic market by the central bank.  “The surge in capital inflows to emerging markets provides
a window of opportunity to lower external vulnerability by
reducing government’s foreign debt through the purchase of
foreign currency at attractive rates in the domestic market,”
the Treasury said. “This will also assist in moderating
exchange-rate strength.”  The Treasury also announced plans to ease foreign-exchange
controls to encourage the flow of money abroad. It didn’t unveil
plans for a tax on foreign portfolio investment as some analysts
had speculated it would.  Budget Deficit  “Borrowing offshore and then bringing the money onshore to
spend would obviously contribute to currency strength, which is
something the South African authorities don’t want,” said
 Kieran Curtis , a fund manager who helps oversee about $2 billion
in emerging market debt at Aviva Investors in London. “If your
revenue is high enough and demand from the local bond market is
sufficient to allow you to borrow domestically then why bother
with international issuance?”  Last year, South Africa sold $2 billion of 6.875 percent
fixed-rate international bonds due May 27, 2019, to help fund a
central government borrowing requirement that reached 7.2
percent of gross domestic product in the year through March.  The shortfall will shrink to 5.6 percent of GDP, or 151
billion rand this fiscal year, 4.9 percent in 2011-12 and 4.3
percent in 2012-13, the Treasury said today. It had previously
forecast a deficit of 6.7 percent of GDP this year.  Borrowing Needs  The public-sector borrowing requirement, which includes
state-owned companies, will be 272 billion rand this year, or
10.1 percent of GDP, compared with February’s estimate of 299.5
billion rand. Borrowing will ease to 268.8 billion rand next
year, 247.4 billion rand in 2012-13 and 218.2 billion rand the
year after.  Borrowing surged as the global financial crisis pushed the
 economy  into a recession in the final quarter of 2008, prompting
the government to pledge to gradually rein in the deficit.  The government’s net debt is expected to rise to 1.32
trillion rand, or 36.9 percent of GDP, by the end of March 2014,
from 825.2 billion rand at the end of the current fiscal year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
