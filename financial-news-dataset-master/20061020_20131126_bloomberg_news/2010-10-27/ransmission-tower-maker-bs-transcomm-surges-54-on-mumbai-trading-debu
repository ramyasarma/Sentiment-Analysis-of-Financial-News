BS Transcomm Ltd. , an Indian company
that cut its initial share sale offer price to attract
investors, surged 54 percent on its trading debut in Mumbai.  The maker of telecommunications and electricity
transmission towers, advanced to 381.25 rupees, after rising as
much as 61 percent, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The
company sold 7.68 million shares at 248 rupees apiece earlier
this month to raise 1.9 billion rupees ($43 million).  BS Transcomm, based in Hyderabad, is expanding to tap
rising demand for power and mobile-phone services in Asia’s
second-most populated nation. The company, which counts a
Reliance Infratel Ltd., a unit of India’s second-largest mobile-
phone company, as a client, had orders valued at 5.32 billion
rupees as on July 31, the company said in its share sale
document.  BS Transcomm extended the offer period for its initial
share sale, after failing to sell all the stock on offer, to
Oct. 13 from Oct. 8. It cut the share price to 248 rupees from
257 rupees, according to a filing to the National Stock
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
