Omron Corp., a Japanese maker of
fare-collection systems and car electronic parts, returned to
profit in the first half on a recovery in the domestic economy
and growing demand in China and Southeast Asia.  Net income was 15 billion yen ($183 million) in the six
months ended Sept. 30, compared with a 6.9 billion yen loss a
year earlier, the Kyoto-based company said today in a statement.
The company left its full-year profit forecast unchanged at 29.5
billion yen.  The strong yen will have a “severe” effect on second-half
profit,  Hisao Sakuta , the company’s president, said at a
briefing in Osaka.  “We want to localize procurement, he said. “For example,
if we buy parts in Singapore, we want to buy in Singapore
dollars.”  The company, which also makes sensors and switches for
factory automation, said in July it would spend 3.3 billion yen
building a plant in Shanghai by 2012 that will produce equipment
for such control systems.  Omron reported a return to operating profit, or sales minus
the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses, of 24.4
billion yen in the first half, exceeding the 22.5 billion yen
average of seven analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue jumped 28 percent to 297.9 billion yen, compared with
300.7 billion yen estimated by six analysts.  The shares rose 3.3 percent to close at 2,031 yen on the
Osaka Securities Exchange. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average added 0.1 percent.  Factory automation devices was Omron’s fastest growing
business, rising 53 percent from a year earlier to make up
almost half of the company’s first-half sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
