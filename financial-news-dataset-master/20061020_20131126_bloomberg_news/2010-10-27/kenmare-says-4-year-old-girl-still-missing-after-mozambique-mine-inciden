Kenmare Resources Plc, which
reported an incident at its Moma Mine in Mozambique this month,
said a four-year-old girl remains missing after the event.  A settling pond breached its southern retaining wall on
Oct. 8, resulting in water, sand and clay flowing through the
nearby village of Topuito.  After an “extensive” search, the company is “operating
under the assumption that the little girl has been lost,” it
said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
