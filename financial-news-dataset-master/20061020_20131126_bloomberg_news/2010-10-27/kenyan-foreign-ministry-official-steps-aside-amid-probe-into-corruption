Kenyan  Foreign Affairs Permanent
Secretary Thuita Mwangi “stepped aside” pending a probe into
corruption allegations, President  Mwai Kibaki  said.  Mwangi submitted a request to stand down that was accepted
by Kibaki, according to a statement e-mailed today by the
presidency in Nairobi, the capital. It didn’t provide further
information.  Lawmakers began a debate yesterday on a report by a
parliamentary committee that accuses Foreign Minister  Moses Wetangula  of corruption in the construction, purchase or sale of
Kenyan embassies in Egypt, Nigeria, Belgium, Japan and Pakistan.
Wetangula denies any wrongdoing and has asked the Kenya Anti-
Corruption Commission to investigate the allegations.  In Egypt, the Kenyan embassy was sold and only 90 percent
of the sale price was submitted to the  Central Bank of Kenya ,
Charles Kilonzo, a lawmaker who is a member of the committee,
said yesterday. Wetangula said the central bank issued a receipt
for receiving the sale price in full.  Other allegations include impropriety in the sale of the
Kenyan High Commission in Lagos, cost increases in the
construction of a chancery and high commissioner’s residence in
Pakistan, and the purchase of an embassy building in Japan that
had previously been rented, Kilonzo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
