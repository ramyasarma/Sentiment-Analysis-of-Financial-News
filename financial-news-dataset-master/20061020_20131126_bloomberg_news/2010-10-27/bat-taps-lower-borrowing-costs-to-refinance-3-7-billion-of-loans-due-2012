British American Tobacco Plc ,
Europe’s largest cigarette maker, opened talks with lenders to
refinance $3.7 billion of loans due in 2012 to benefit from a
halving of debt costs this year.  The maker of Dunhill, Kent and Lucky Strike cigarettes is
seeking to renew its borrowings “to take advantage of the
favorable credit market conditions,” spokeswoman  Catherine Armstrong  said in an interview. “We are doing this ahead of
time as a prudent housekeeping practice.”  Banks have cut interest margins to European companies rated
between BBB+ and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s to 78 basis points
this year from an average 142 basis points last year, according
to Bloomberg data. BAT is rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “BAT is a defensive name with robust cash flows that are
attractive to lenders,” said  Tina Cook , an analyst at Charles
Stanley in London, which has a buy recommendation on the stock.  BAT  agreed to pay interest of 225 basis points more than
the euro interbank offered rate last year to extend the maturity
on a 700 million-euro ($968 million) facility by three years to
2012, with an option to extend it to 2013. The London-based
company also has a 1.75 billion-pound ($2.77 billion) revolving
credit due in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The euro facility was part of loans BAT used to fund its
$1.72 billion acquisition of Turkish state-owned cigarette maker
Tekel in 2008, the data show.  BAT’s first-half profit rose to 1.53 billion pounds from
1.45 billion pounds a year earlier, the company said on July 28.
Its shares have risen 19 percent in London trading this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
