The outlook for Italian banks
“remains negative,” because of weak profitability and limited
capital, Moody’s Investors Service said in its Banking System
Outlook on Italy.  “The outlook reflects the banking system’s limited capital
and reserves to cope with growing asset-quality challenges” in
addition to weak profitability,  Carlo Gori , a senior analyst at
Moody’s, said in a statement.  Earnings generated by Italian banks will remain under
pressure in the coming quarters, hurt by high credit costs and
narrower interest margins, Moody’s said.  Italy’s biggest banks, including  UniCredit SpA ,  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA ,  Banco Popolare SC , and  Banca Monte dei Paschi di
Siena  passed European Union stress test in July. They are
cutting costs and shedding non-strategic assets to strengthen
finances after the country’s worst recession since the Second
World War.  The asset quality of Italian lenders is likely to
deteriorate “in the near term,” as a weak economic environment
impacts borrowers’ payment capacity, Moody’s said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
