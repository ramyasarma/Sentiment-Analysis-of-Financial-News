Copper prices fell from a 27-month
high as the dollar’s rebound curbed demand for commodities as
alternative investments.  The greenback rose as much as 0.7 percent against a basket
of major currencies. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of
19 raw materials dropped for the first time in four sessions,
led by cotton and industrial metals.  “We are lower across most markets,”  Edward Meir , an
analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Darien, Connecticut, said
in a report. “Not surprisingly, the dollar is the main reason
behind the general decline.”  Copper futures for December delivery slid 9.35 cents, or
2.4 percent, to close at $3.7755 a pound at 1:23 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $3.90, the highest
level for a most-active contract since July 7, 2008.  The metal jumped 24 percent in the third quarter. The rally
curbed industrial demand, said  Walter de Wet , an analyst at
Standard Bank Plc in London.  “With prices at current levels, we continue to see some
softness in the physical market,” de Wet said.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped $210, or 2.5 percent, to $8,300 a metric ton
($3.76 a pound). Lead, zinc, tin, nickel and aluminum also
declined on the LME.  To contact the reporters on this story:
