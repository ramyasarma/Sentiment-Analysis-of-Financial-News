Absa Capital, a unit of South
Africa’s  Absa Group Ltd. , said it may start the first gold-
backed exchange-traded funds in Kenya and Nigeria.  “Absa Capital is in talks with the Nigerian Stock Exchange
to potentially secondary list our NewGold exchange-traded
fund,”  Vladimir Nedeljkovic , the Johannesburg-based investment
bank’s principal for ETFs and index products, said today. He is
in Kenya to discuss starting the ETF in the East African nation.  NewGold, which has its main listing on South Africa’s  JSE
Ltd. , is the largest gold ETF in Africa’s biggest economy, with
more than $2 billion in assets. Earlier this year,  Absa Capital ,
listed NewGold on the Botswana Stock Exchange.  Absa, South Africa’s largest retail bank and which is
controlled by  Barclays Plc , wants to expand in the continent to
boost earnings. Absa Capital, which was launched in 2005 after
the U.K. bank bought a stake in the lender, contributed more
than one-fifth of Absa’s profit in the first half to June 2010.  In Nigeria, the NewGold ETF will develop the nation’s
capital markets by improving liquidity on the bourse and
bringing another asset class to the West African market, helping
investors to “diversify their exposures,” Nedeljkovic said.
“Our discussions with the NSE are in very early stages and we
cannot provide any timing.”  ETFs trade like stocks, allowing investors access to
commodities like gold and platinum without taking physical
delivery of them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
