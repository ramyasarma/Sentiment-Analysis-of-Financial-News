Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today his country is not currently planning to
deploy additional fiscal stimulus beyond what has already been
committed.  “I just met with colleagues in Korea and there was no
suggestions that Canada would do anything more than it is
doing,” Flaherty told reporters outside Parliament. Flaherty
and his Group of Twenty counterparts met in Gyeongju, Korea last
weekend.  Flaherty said Oct. 12 that Canada will eliminate last
year’s record C$55.6 billion ($54 billion) deficit by 2015, the
first Group of Seven country to do so, and reiterated he will
end stimulus spending in March. Opposition groups, including the
New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois, have said the
government should extend the deadline for public works spending
and extended  jobless  benefits.  “There’s another five months of stimulus through the
infrastructure programs, and then also the tax reductions that
are already in law will come into place next year,” Flaherty
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
