Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. , a South
African investment company, will list shares in its Mvelaserve
unit on  Johannesburg’s stock exchange  on Nov. 29, it said.  The company will spin off the unit to shareholders at a
ratio of 25 Mvelaserve shares for every 100 shares in Mvela
Group, Mvelaphanda said in a statement today. The stock will be
distributed to shareholders on Dec. 3.  Mvelaserve owns Protea Coin, South Africa’s biggest
security company, and the King Pie fast-food chain. It offers
facilities management, catering and cleaning services and has
interests in gaming and freight. It employs 30,000 people.  The spinoff of Mvelaserve follows Mvelaphanda’s
distribution of its holding in  Life Healthcare Group Holdings
Ltd. , which was listed on the Johannesburg bourse on June 1.
Life Healthcare raised 5.26 billion rand ($680 million) in South
Africa’s biggest public share sale.  About 142 million shares will be listed, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
