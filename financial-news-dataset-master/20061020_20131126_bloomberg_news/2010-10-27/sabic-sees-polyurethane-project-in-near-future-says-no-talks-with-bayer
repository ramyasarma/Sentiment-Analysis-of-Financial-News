Saudi Basic Industries Corp. Chief
Executive Officer Mohamed al-Mady said he’s working on a
polyurethane project with an undisclosed technology provider and
plans to complete the plan “in the near future.”  The CEO spoke to reporters at the K 2010 plastics 
conference in Dusseldorf today. Al-Mady said that buying Bayer 
AG’s polycarbonates business would not be a possibility.  “For cartel reasons, we’d not be interested in Bayer’s 
polycarbonates business, so it would mean breaking the company 
up, which Bayer does not want,” al-Mady said.  There are no talks with the German company on its material
science unit, the CEO said, responding to an article in Die Zeit
today reporting that Sabic would be interested in the company’s
plastics business if Bayer approached Sabic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
