Mexico’s Congress may reallocate as
much as 120 billion pesos ($9.6 billion) from President  Felipe Calderon ’s proposal for 2011 spending, said Luis Videgaray, head
of the lower house budget committee.  The shift may range from 80 billion to 120 billion pesos
and would increase spending on infrastructure and security, said
Videgaray, a member of the opposition  Institutional
Revolutionary Party , or PRI, which has the largest number of
representatives in the lower house.  Calderon last month proposed total spending of 3.35
trillion pesos for next year, an increase of 2.3 percent in real
terms from 2010, or 5.5 percent in nominal terms. The spending 
changes envisioned in the lower house “may become an important
growth driver” for the country, Videgaray said today in an
interview at Bloomberg’s Mexico City office.  PRI lawmakers want to eliminate infrastructure budget cuts
proposed by the executive branch of government,  Videgaray said.
Any funds reallocated to infrastructure or security would be
taken from operating expenses such as salaries, he added.  If the lower house doesn’t shift the spending, Mexico’s
economy may grow less than the 3.9 percent projected for next
year, Videgaray said. A “useful investment” in infrastructure
may boost the nation’s growth to just above 4 percent, said
Videgaray, who served as finance minister of the State of Mexico
from 2005 to 2009.  2011 Income  The lower house must approve the spending portion of the
budget by Nov. 15.  Mexico’s Senate yesterday approved the income portion of
the 2011 budget with changes proposed by the lower house. The
income budget calls for a deficit equal to 0.5 percent of gross
domestic product and an estimated oil price of $65.40 per
barrel. The bill envisions total spending of 3.43 trillion pesos
for next year.  The budget proposed by Calderon, who belongs to the
National Action Party, or PAN, sought a deficit of 0.3 percent
and estimated oil would sell for $63 per barrel on average next
year.  The changes to the income bill would allow the government
to spend an additional 61 billion pesos ($4.9 billion) next
year, Roberto Gil Zuarth, a PAN member of the finance committee
in the lower house, said on Oct. 20.  As state finance minister, Videgaray was the highest-
ranking economic adviser to Governor  Enrique Pena Nieto , a PRI
member who is the leading candidate for the 2012 presidential
elections, according to a poll released Sept. 5 by Consulta
Mitofsky.  For the next administration, “Videgaray may become a
minister or governor,” said Roy Campos, head of Consulta
Mitofsky.  To contact the reporters on this story:
