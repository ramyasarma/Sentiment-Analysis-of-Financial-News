(Corrects prior month data to August in third paragraph.)  U.S. stock-index futures extended
losses after government data signaled that gains in business
investment will cool.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December lost 0.5 percent to 1,177.2 at 8:33 a.m. in New York.
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 42 points, or 0.4
percent, to 11,082.  Orders for U.S. non-military capital equipment excluding
airplanes dropped in September. Bookings for such goods,
including computers and machinery meant to last at least three
years, fell 0.6 percent after a 4.8 percent gain in August that
was smaller than previously estimated, figures from Commerce
Department showed. Total orders climbed 3.3 percent last month,
led by a doubling in aircraft demand.  The S&P 500 has rallied 13 percent since the end of August
as investors speculated that the Fed will pump more cash into
the economy to safeguard the recovery.  The central bank will probably announce a program to buy
several hundred billion dollars of U.S. Treasury bonds over the
next few months, the Wall Street Journal reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  The central bank will acquire fewer assets through its new
plan, expected to be announced at the conclusion of the Fed’s
Nov. 2-3 meeting, than the $2 trillion asset-purchase program
that it embarked upon during the financial crisis, according to
the report. Officials want flexibility in the new program to
determine whether it works, the Journal said.  Per-share earnings have topped estimates at 174 of the 206
companies in the S&P 500 that have announced results since Oct.
7, or about 84 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Net income has increased 39 percent for the group as sales rose
7.6 percent. S&P 500 profits are headed for a fourth straight
quarterly increase after a record nine-quarter slump.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
