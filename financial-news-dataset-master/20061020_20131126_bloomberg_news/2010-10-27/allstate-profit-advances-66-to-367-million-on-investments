Allstate Corp.,  the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, said third-quarter profit
rose 66 percent as investment losses narrowed.  Net income climbed to $367 million, or 68 cents a share,
from $221 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier, the Northbrook,
Illinois-based insurer said today in a statement. Operating
profit, which excludes some investment results, was 83 cents a
share, missing the 96-cent average  estimate  of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Estimates are notoriously volatile,” Chief Executive
Officer  Thomas Wilson  said in a phone interview. “We’re right
in the middle of the range we gave people. From our standpoint,
we’ve achieved the results we said we were going to.”  Allstate, which typically gets the largest portion of
revenue from auto insurance and sells most policies through
agents, is competing for new customers with  Progressive Corp. 
and Warren Buffett’s  Geico Corp. , which increased Internet and
phone sales. Allstate is seeking to boost customer retention
after losing clients in 2009.  Allstate climbed about 8.1 percent this year in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, compared with the 18 percent
rise in the 24-company  KBW Insurance Index . The insurer fell 4.2
percent at 6:04 p.m. in New York trading following the earnings
announcement.  Investments  Realized investment losses narrowed to $144 million in the
period ended Sept. 30 from $519 million a year earlier.  Wilson reshaped Allstate’s $100 billion investment
portfolio since 2008 when the company posted a $1.7 billion
annual loss, cutting back on stocks, municipal debt and
commercial mortgage-backed securities while acquiring corporate
bonds. Corporate debt returned 5.3 percent in the third quarter,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Corporate &
High Yield Master Index.  “Lower interest rates raise all boats,” Wilson said.
“You should expect us always to be heavily concentrated in
fixed income.”  Underwriting profit at property-casualty operations fell 23
percent to $266 million from $346 million a year earlier.
Allstate made 4.1 cents for every premium dollar in its property
and casualty coverage, compared with 5.3 cents a year earlier.
Excluding the effects of catastrophes and changes to reserves
for claims from prior quarters, profit was 10.8 cents, compared
with 12 cents last year.  Catastrophe Costs  Catastrophe costs narrowed to $386 million from $407
million as the U.S. escaped damage from major hurricanes.
Premium revenue from the property liability business slipped to
$6.5 billion from $6.54 billion as increased rates at the main
auto business weren’t enough to cushion a decline in the number
of policies in force.  Industrywide, U.S. property and casualty insurance sales
fell for 12 straight quarters before rising 1.3 percent in the
second quarter of 2010, the Property Casualty Insurers
Association of America said in a September  statement .  “For the past 15 quarters they’ve had either negative or
flat premium growth,” said  Alan Devlin , an analyst with
Atlantic Equities LLP. Allstate was among the first to raise
rates in property casualty insurance three years ago, which
contributed to a decline in market share, he said.  Book value per share, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, increased 6.7 percent to $35.48 from $33.24 at the
end of the second quarter. Net unrealized gains totaled $2.7
billion as of Sept. 30, compared with a $400 million gain at the
end of June.  Unrealized Gain  The insurer has continued to reduce its municipal bond and
real estate holdings, while increasing high-yield debt in the
second and third quarters, Wilson said. “The net of all that is
unrealized gain,” he said.  The Allstate Financial unit, which sells life and
retirement policies, earned $85 million, compared with a net
loss of $38 million a year earlier. Allstate said in 2009 it
planned to cut 1,000 jobs at the unit to counter losses.  Car owners who curtailed their driving during the recession
have begun to return to the road. Travel on U.S. roads increased
1.6 percent, or 4.3 billion vehicle miles, from the year-earlier
period in August 2010, according to the  Federal Highway
Administration . Total travel for 2010 so far is up 0.4 percent.
The agency has not yet released results for September.  An increase in driving could lead to more claims and
increased payouts from auto insurers, Barclays Capital said in a
statement released on Oct. 4. Allstate paid $4.6 billion in
property liability claims in the three months ended Sept. 30, up
from $4.57 billion in the third quarter last year.  Premium revenue for Allstate’s standard auto policies fell
to $4.13 billion from $4.17 billion in the same period last
year, according to a  supplemental filing  on Allstate’s website.
The number of policyholders decreased to 17.479 million from
17.529 million at the end of the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
