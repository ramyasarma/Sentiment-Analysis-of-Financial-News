China’s economic growth will be more
than 10 percent this year, the Financial News reported, citing
Yi Xianrong, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.  The central bank’s measures have had a limited impact on
overly loose liquidity, the newspaper reported, citing Yi.
Liquidity may increase consumer prices as well as asset prices,
the report said, citing Yi. The Financial News newspaper is
published by the People’s Bank of China.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
