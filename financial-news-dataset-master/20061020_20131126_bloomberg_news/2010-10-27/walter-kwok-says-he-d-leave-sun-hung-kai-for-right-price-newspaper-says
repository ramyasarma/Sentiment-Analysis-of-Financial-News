Walter Kwok said he may agree to
leave  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd . if his brothers offer him a
“reasonable price,” more than HK$20 billion, the South China
Morning Post reported, citing an interview with Kwok.  The HK$20 billion they’d offered to remove him as a
beneficiary of of a key trust controlling the family’s assets,
including a 42.4 percent stake in Sun Hung Kai Properties, “is
not a fair valuation,” Kwok said, as cited by the Hong Kong-
based English-language newspaper.  Kwok said he’s willing to go back into company managment if
his two younger brothers want him to, and if not he’s willing to
negotiate the buyout price, the Post said. He also wants
clarification as to whether his children are still trust
beneficiaries, the newspaper said.  Sun Hung Kai Properties declined to comment on Kwok’s
remarks and said the contents of an Oct. 4 press release are
still valid, the Post said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
