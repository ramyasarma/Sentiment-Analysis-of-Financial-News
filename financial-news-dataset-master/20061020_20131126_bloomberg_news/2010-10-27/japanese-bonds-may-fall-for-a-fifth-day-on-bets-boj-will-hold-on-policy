Japan’s 10-year government bonds may
fall for a fifth day, the longest streak since February, on
prospects the Bank of Japan today will refrain from easing
monetary policy further.  Japan’s 10-year  yields  are likely to rise to a one-month
high after Treasuries dropped yesterday amid speculation a
Federal Reserve program to boost the economy may be gradual.
Demand for government debt may also drop after the yen retreated
to a two-week low against the dollar yesterday, backing up the
case for the BOJ to keep policy unchanged.  “Japan’s bonds are likely to weaken, as a drop in
Treasuries signals a change in trend,” Shinji Nomura, chief
debt strategist at Tokyo-based Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.,
wrote in a note today.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery traded at
143.13 in London from 143.18 at the 3 p.m. close at the Tokyo
Stock Exchange yesterday. The contract will open for trading at
9 a.m. Tokyo time.  The benchmark 10-year bond hasn’t traded yet today at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The yield on the 0.8 percent bond due September 2020 rose 4.5
basis points to 0.955 percent yesterday, the highest since Oct.
1. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Treasury 10-year yields gained eight basis points to 2.72
percent yesterday in New York, according BGCantor Market Data.  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 2 percent annual pace
in the third quarter, up from a 1.7 percent rate in the previous
three months, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before tomorrow’s data.  The yen dropped to as low as 81.99 per dollar yesterday,
the weakest since Oct. 13. All 15 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News said the BOJ will leave policy unchanged today.  The 0.8 percent bond due in September 2020 closed at 98.68
to yield 0.945 percent yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Yen
Bond Fixing Price. The level is an average rate set at 6:30 p.m.
