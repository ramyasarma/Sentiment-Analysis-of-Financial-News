Canadian lawmakers today defeated a
law that would have forced the government to probe human-rights
and environmental allegations against Canadian mining companies
operating overseas.  The  legislation , known as C-300 and proposed by  John McKay ,
a lawmaker with the main opposition Liberal Party, was defeated
in a 140 to 134 vote.  Business and  mining groups , and companies such as Barrick
Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer, have  warned  that
the legislation would have made it easy for competitors and
other groups to tarnish reputations and limit investment
opportunities. Canada’s  mining industry  accounts for about 18
percent of the Toronto Stock Exchange’s capitalization.  Trade Minister  Peter Van Loan  said earlier that the law
would drive companies abroad, cost jobs, hinder financing and
curtail investments, and that all Conservatives would vote
against it. The Liberals and the New Democratic Party let their
lawmakers vote as they wished on the legislation.  Under the proposed law, violations by miners would have
forced the government to withdraw political support, export
credits and investments by the Canada Pension Plan, the
country’s second-biggest fund with C$130 billion ($126 billion)
in assets.  About 60 percent of the world’s exploration companies are
Canadian,  according  to the Mining Association of Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
