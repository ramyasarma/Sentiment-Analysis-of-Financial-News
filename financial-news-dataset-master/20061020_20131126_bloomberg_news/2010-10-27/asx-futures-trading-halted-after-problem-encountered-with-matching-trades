The Australian stock exchange has
halted futures trading citing a problem encountered with the
matching of trades.  “There was an issue with the matching of trades,” ASX Ltd.
spokesman  Matthew Gibbs  said by telephone. “We’ve had to halt
the market. The problem is being investigated.”  The problem occurred about a 90 seconds after a statistic
bureau announcement on consumer prices at 11:30 a.m., Gibbs said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
