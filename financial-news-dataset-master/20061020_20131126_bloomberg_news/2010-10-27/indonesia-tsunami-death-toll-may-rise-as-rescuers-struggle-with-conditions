The death toll from a tsunami that
slammed the Mantawai islands off Indonesia’s Sumatra two days
ago is unclear as rescue agencies struggle with disrupted
telecommunications and difficult search conditions.  At least 113 people were killed and 150 others missing,
Mujiharto, head of the crisis center at the Health Ministry,
said in a mobile-phone text message last night. The  National
Disaster Management Agency  said 31 people were confirmed dead
and 174 missing as of late yesterday. The agency received its
information from the regional disaster office on Sumatra,
Maryadi, a spokesman at the national agency, said by phone.  The 7.5-magnitude temblor struck the Kepulauan Mentawai
region of Indonesia, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) from
Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra, and 640
kilometers from Singapore at 9:42 p.m. local time Oct. 25, the
US Geological Survey said. The quake triggered a 3-meter (10-
foot) tsunami that that reached 400 meters inland, the agency
said yesterday.  A 7.6-magnitude earthquake in the same area in October 2009
left more than 1,000 people dead in Padang, many of whom were
buried in mudslides and the rubble of collapses buildings. Less
than a month earlier, a magnitude-7 temblor south of Java on
Sept. 2 left 82 people dead.  A tsunami generated by a magnitude-9.1 earthquake off
northern Sumatra in December 2004 left about 220,000 people dead
or missing in 12 countries around the Indian Ocean.  To contact the reporters on this story:
