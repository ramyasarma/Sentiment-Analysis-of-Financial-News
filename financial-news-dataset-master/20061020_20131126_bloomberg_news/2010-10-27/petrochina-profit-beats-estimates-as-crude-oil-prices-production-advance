PetroChina Co. , Asia’s biggest
company by market value, may post faster profit growth for the
second straight quarter as overseas acquisitions drive output
gains and energy prices climb.  Net income in the three months to Dec. 31 may jump 46
percent from a year earlier to 32.2 billion yuan ($4.8 billion),
according to calculations based on 2010  estimates  of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Third-quarter profit rose 13 percent to
34.7 billion yuan, PetroChina said yesterday, beating a mean
estimate of 33.6 billion yuan.  PetroChina ramped up output this year with acquisitions
including an Australian coal-seam gas producer and stakes in two
Canadian oil-sands projects to meet demand in the world’s
fastest-growing major economy. Crude futures in New York gained
12 percent to average $76.21 a barrel last quarter, and China
raised fuel prices for the second time this year on Oct. 26.  “I’m bullish on PetroChina,” said  Kim-Chong Tan , an
energy analyst at Yuanta Securities HK Co. “I can see oil
prices averaging at least $80 in the fourth quarter, and
PetroChina will also benefit from rising oil product prices.”  Tan said he plans to raise his full-year  profit  forecast to
about 135 billion yuan from 133 billion yuan. PetroChina’s nine-
month net income climbed 23 percent to 100 billion yuan.  Gordon Kwan , head of regional energy research at Mirae
Asset Securities (HK) Ltd., said China’s largest oil and gas
producer may report full-year profit of 138 billion yuan.  “These are very strong results,” Kwan said. “I can see a
lot of analysts revising their full-year profit estimates
upwards after this.”  Overseas Acquisitions  The  shares  rose 3.2 percent this year in Hong Kong trading,
compared with a 6.3 percent gain in the benchmark Hang Seng
index. The stock climbed 0.3 percent to HK$9.62 at 10:01 a.m.
local time, giving PetroChina a market value of about $300
billion, second only to Exxon Mobil Corp. in the world.  Oil and gas production increased 4 percent in the first
nine months to 921 million barrels of oil equivalent, Beijing-
based PetroChina said in its earnings statement. Total overseas
output jumped 10 percent to 84 million barrels of oil equivalent.  The Chinese company plans to spend at least $60 billion in
the next decade on overseas acquisitions after paying about $6.2
billion in the past year for refineries and reserves in
 countries  including Singapore and Central Asia.  PetroChina completed the C$1.9 billion ($1.8 billion) stake
purchase in two Canadian oil-sands projects in February and the
acquisition of Arrow Energy Ltd. with Royal Dutch Shell Plc for
A$3.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in August.  Fuel Demand  About 68 percent of PetroChina’s  operating income  came from
oil and gas output last year and the company relies less on
refined products, prices for which are controlled by the
government to curb inflation. China raised prices this year in
April and October.  Full-year profit may rise 28 percent to 132.2 billion yuan,
according to a mean estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Seventeen out of 32 analysts  rate  the shares a
“Buy,” while 13 recommend a “Hold.”  China consumed 8.6 million barrels of oil a day last year
compared with 4.47 million in 1999, according to the BP
Statistical Review of World Energy. The International Energy
Agency estimates demand may reach 11.63 million a day by 2015.  -- John Duce  and  Wang Ying . Editors:  Ryan Woo , Amit Prakash.  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
