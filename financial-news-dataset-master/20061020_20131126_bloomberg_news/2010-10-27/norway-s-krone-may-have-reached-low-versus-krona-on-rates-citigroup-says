Norway’s krone may have reached its
lowest level “for now” against the Swedish krona, after
Sweden’s central bank scaled back its interest-rate outlook,
Citigroup Inc. said.  “With investors paring back Riksbank rate-hike
expectations, but with Norges Bank rate expectations likely
close to rock bottom, we think that we may have seen the lows”
of the krone versus the krona,  Valentin Marinov , a London-based
currency strategist, wrote today in a note to investors. “Yet
we hesitate to call the latest rebound in the cross the start of
a trend reversal. A sustainable uptrend in krone-krona will
require in our view more evidence of economic outperformance
from Norway.”  The krone rose 0.1 percent to 1.1484 kronor at 7:45 a.m. in
London today. It weakened to 1.1329 kronor yesterday, the lowest
level since January 2009.  Norway’s central bank will leave the overnight deposit rate
unchanged at 2 percent today, according to all 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
