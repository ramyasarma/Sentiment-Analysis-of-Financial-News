Korean Air Lines Co. , South
Korea’s  largest carrier , posted higher-than-expected profit
in the third quarter as the stronger local currency and
economic growth spurred travel and cargo demand.  Net  income  more than doubled to 583.8 billion won ($519
million) in the three months ended Sept. 30 from 264 billion
won a year earlier, the Seoul-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. The result exceeds the 487.4 billion
won average of nine analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales rose 26 percent to 3.1 trillion won.  Korean Air boosted  international passenger traffic  6.3
percent from a year earlier as the stronger local currency
helped increase demand for outbound trips during the peak
summer vacation season. The dollar averaged about 1,182 won
in the quarter, compared with about 1,239 won a year earlier.
Cargo traffic rose 13 percent to 2.4 billion revenue freight
kilometers as a global economic recovery lifted demand for
electric devices and auto parts.  “International passenger traffic will likely continue
to rise on the strong local currency,”  Joo Ik Chan , an
analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities Co in Seoul, said
before the results were announced. “The company’s cargo
traffic is expected to ease in the fourth quarter, given the
lower sales outlook for electronics manufacturers.”  Share Performance  Korean Air  fell 2.1 percent to close at 71,200 won in
Seoul trading, after rising as much as 0.6 percent earlier
today when earnings were announced.  Operating  profit , or sales minus the cost of goods sold
and administrative expenses, more than tripled to 358.1
billion won from a year earlier. The airline made a 368.4
billion won currency gain mostly on dollar-denominated debt
as the won appreciated, the company said.  Korean Air filled 78.4 percent of available seats in the
third quarter, 3.7 percentage points higher than a year
earlier.  The carrier’s full-year freight volumes will probably
surpass a record set in 2007, President  Chi Chang Hoon  said
in July.  The increase in cargo traffic helped the airline fill
74.7 percent of its freight space in the third quarter and
the yield climbed 35 percent from a year ago.  The yield for international passenger traffic jumped 30
percent from a year ago to 9 cents in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
