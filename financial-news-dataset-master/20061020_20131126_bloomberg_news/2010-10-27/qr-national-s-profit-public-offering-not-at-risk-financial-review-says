QR National said it’s not at risk of
missing its profit forecast or repricing its A$6 billion initial
public offering after Asciano Group issued an earnings warning
and said volumes on its Pacific National rail network were below
 expectations in the September quarter, the Australian Financial
Review reported. Asciano’s warnings related to issues specific
to the company, and QR National is confident of delivering on
its forecasts, the newspaper said, citing Marcus McAuliffe,
chief executive of QR coal operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
