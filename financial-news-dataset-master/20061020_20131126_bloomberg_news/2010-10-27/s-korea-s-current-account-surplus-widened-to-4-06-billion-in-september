South Korea’s current-account
surplus widened in September from a four-month low as exports
rose and the goods balance increased.  The  surplus  was $4.06 billion, up from a revised $2.2
billion in August, the Bank of Korea said in a statement in
Seoul today. The current account is the broadest measure of
international trade, tracking goods, services and investment
income.  Exports have fueled the recovery in Asia’s fourth-largest
economy this year. Gross domestic product growth slowed to 4.5
percent last quarter as goods shipments cooled and the won
surged 7.2 percent over the period, the most in Asia, a report
showed yesterday.  “The surplus is bigger than expected this year on robust
exports as China, the nation’s biggest export market, grows fast
and other major economies remain on a recovery track,” said  Lee Sang Jae , an economist at Hyundai Securities Co. in Seoul.  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,128.66 per dollar as of 10:36
a.m. in Seoul. The benchmark  Kospi  stock index was little
changed at 1,910.41.  Bonds and the nation’s currency fell yesterday after
central bank governor  Kim Choong Soo  said South Korea may
consider imposing capital controls to slow fund inflows that
have driven up the won.  The currency is expected to appreciate to 1,100 per dollar
by the end of 2010 and 1,050 per dollar in 2011, Lee said.  Economic Growth  South Korea’s economic growth in 2010 is likely to be 6
percent, Finance Minister  Yoon Jeung Hyun  said in Seoul today.
Domestic demand and exports are continuing to expand, though
“external uncertainties” from the U.S. and Europe are growing,
he said.  Policy makers have left borrowing costs unchanged for three
straight months at 2.25 percent following a July advance from a
record-low 2 percent.  Exports account for about half the economy and grew for the
11th straight month in September. Overseas shipments have
boosted earnings this year at firms such as  Hyundai Motor Co. ,
South Korea’s largest automaker.  The Bank of Korea forecasts a 2010 current-account surplus
of $30 billion, Edaily reported today, citing central bank
official Lee Young Bog.  The surplus had narrowed in August as the value of goods
exports fell amid a holiday season that shuttered some factories.  Total exports on a customs-cleared basis, which excludes
ships, rose 16.5 percent last month from a year earlier,
compared with a revised 28.1 percent increase in August. Imports
advanced 17.5 percent.  The surplus on traded goods widened to $5.67 billion last
month from a revised $3.81 billion in August, today’s report
showed. The services deficit, which measures the flow of travel,
transport costs and royalties, was $1.96 billion in September,
compared with a revised $1.78 billion in August.  The income account had a $509 million surplus last month,
from a revised $608.8 million surplus in August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
