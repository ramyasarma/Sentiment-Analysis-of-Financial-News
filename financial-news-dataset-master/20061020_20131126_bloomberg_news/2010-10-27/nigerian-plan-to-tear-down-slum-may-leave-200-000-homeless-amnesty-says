A state government’s plan to tear
down waterfront slums in  Nigeria’s  southern oil-industry hub of
Port Harcourt may leave more than 200,000 people homeless,
 Amnesty International  said in a report released today.  The Rivers State government’s urban renewal program doesn’t
include plans to resettle residents evicted from settlements
that would be demolished, the London-based human rights group’s
report said.  “These demolitions are likely to plunge hundreds of
thousands of Nigeria’s most vulnerable citizens into further
poverty,” Tawanda Hondora, the rights group’s deputy Africa
program director, said in a statement. The Rivers State
information commissioner, Ibim Semenitari, didn’t immediately
respond to telephone messages seeking comment.  The largest city in Nigeria’s oil region, Port Harcourt is
a base for international energy companies operating in nearby
onshore and offshore oil fields. Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil
producer.  Demolition of a settlement in Port Harcourt known as
Njemanze in 2009 resulted in the displacement of more than
13,000 people, Amnesty International said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
