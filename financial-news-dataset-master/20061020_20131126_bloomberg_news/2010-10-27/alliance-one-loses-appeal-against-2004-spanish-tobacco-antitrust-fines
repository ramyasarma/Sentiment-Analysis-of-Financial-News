Alliance One International Inc.  lost
a challenge at the European Union’s second-highest court over
antitrust fines levied six years ago for fixing the prices paid
to Spanish growers for tobacco.  The EU’s  General Court  today upheld a fine of 1.8 million
euros ($2.5 million) levied on Alliance One and a subsidiary by
the  European Commission  for their liability concerning another
unit’s involvement in the cartel.  The EU’s antitrust regulator at the time “was fully
entitled to attribute liability” to Alliance One and its
subsidiary Standard Commercial Tobacco Co. and to “hold them
jointly and severally liable for payment of the fine,” a three-
judge panel of the Luxembourg-based court ruled today.  The European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s antitrust
regulator, in October 2004 fined five companies a total of 20
million euros for price-fixing and production-sharing between
1996 and 2001 in the Spanish tobacco-processing market.  A call to Alliance One in Morrisville, North Carolina,
wasn’t answered before office hours.  The case is T-24/05, Alliance One International and Others
v Commission, at the European Union General Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
