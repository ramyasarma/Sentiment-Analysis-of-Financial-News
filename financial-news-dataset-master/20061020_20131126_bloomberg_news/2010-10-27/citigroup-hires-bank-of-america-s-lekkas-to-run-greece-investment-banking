Citigroup Inc. , the fourth-biggest
U.S. bank by deposits, hired Bank of America Corp.’s  Pantelis Lekkas  to run its corporate and investment banking operations in
Greece and Cyprus.  Lekkas, 36, will be based in London and start in January,
according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News and
confirmed by Citigroup spokesman  Jeff French . He was formerly at
Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit for six years, where he
oversaw investment banking in the same markets. Officials at
Bank of America couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  Citigroup, which opened an office in Greece in 1964 to
serve clients in the shipping industry, employs more than 1,300
people in the country. Greece’s government is preparing to sell
assets after the country’s near-default this year.  The lender ranks 20th among underwriters of Greek debt so
far in 2010, unchanged from the year-earlier period and behind
15th-placed Bank of America, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Debt sales dropped 33 percent to about $54.1 billion in the
period. The New York-based firm ranks 10th for stock sales in
Greece this year, up from 15th in 2009, as fundraisings dropped
31 percent, the data show.  Citigroup this year arranged a share sale for Navios
Maritime Partners LP and provided a shipping loan to Toisa Ltd.,
Bloomberg data show. Separately, National Bank of Greece SA
raised 1.8 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in a rights offering
this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
