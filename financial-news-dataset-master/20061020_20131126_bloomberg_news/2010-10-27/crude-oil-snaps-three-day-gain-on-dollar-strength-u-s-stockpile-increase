Crude oil dropped after U.S. orders
for capital goods declined, signaling that investment will cool,
and the dollar rose against the euro.  Oil fell 0.7 percent after  bookings  for non-military
equipment like computers and machinery slipped 0.6 percent in
September. The dollar climbed on speculation the Federal Reserve
will buy less debt than some traders previously estimated. A
government report today showed that U.S. oil supplies surged
five times more than was  projected  last week.  “The economy doesn’t appear to be heading back into
recession, but it clearly isn’t showing any robustness,” said
 Bill O’Grady , chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in St. Louis. “The key is what the Federal Reserve
will do to shore up the economy and what this will mean for the
dollar.”  Crude oil for December delivery fell 61 cents to settle at
$81.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures are
up 3 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for December settlement declined 43 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to end the session at $83.23 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The dollar appreciated as much as 0.9 percent to $1.3734
per euro, the highest level since Oct. 20, before trading at
$1.3764 at 3:08 p.m. in New York. That compares with $1.3859
yesterday. A stronger dollar reduces the appeal of commodities
as an alternative investment.  Capital Goods  Total orders for capital goods climbed 3.3 percent last
month, led by a doubling in aircraft demand, figures from the
Commerce Department showed today.  Sales of  new homes  rose in September for a second month to
a pace that signals the industry is struggling to overcome the
effects of a jobless rate hovering near 10 percent. Purchases
increased 6.6 percent to a 307,000 annual rate, a separate
Commerce Department report showed. Demand is near the record low
of 282,000 reached in May.  “The S&P and the dollar are the key factors moving this
market,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst with Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “The fundamentals are in the
background and remain soft.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index slipped 0.6 percent to
1,178.69 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 0.7
percent to 11,088.29.  “There’s a lot of easy money sloshing around, so what
happens to oil depends on what’s happening in other markets,”
said  Sean Brodrick , a natural resource analyst with Weiss
Research in Jupiter, Florida. “There was a big build in crude
stocks, and a drop in gasoline, so today’s report was a wash.”  U.S. Inventories  Crude oil supplies  climbed 5.01 million barrels to 366.2
million in the week ended Oct. 22, the biggest increase since
July, the Energy Department report showed. A 1 million-barrel
gain was forecast, according to the median of 15 analyst
responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline inventories  plunged 4.39 million barrels to 214.9
million. Stockpiles were estimated to increase by 625,000
barrels.  Gasoline futures for November delivery gained 0.8 cent, or
0.4 percent, to settle at $2.102 a gallon in New York.  “The gasoline total may be a temporary reflection of the
French strike,” Evans said.  Strikes to protest measures to increase the retirement age
in France forced nine of 11 refineries to shut, causing fuel
shortages and disrupting exports. A quarter of France’s refinery
workers agreed to go back to work after the French Senate passed
the bill yesterday.  Shut Refineries  Yves le Goff, spokesman for UFIP, an industry group for
refineries, said today five plants are ready to resume
operations and are awaiting supplies of crude oil. Workers at
Total SA refineries in France are on strike today and production
remains halted, a company spokesman said by phone from Paris.  The Port of Marseille, on France’s southern coast, said
today 37 crude-oil carriers and 20 oil-product tankers were
stranded because of strikes.  Crude oil production capacity is “hopelessly
constrained,” while demand is recovering,  Jan Stuart , a global
oil analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., said during the Oil
Council’s  Americas Energy Capital Assembly  in New York.  Oil demand growth in 2011 will be similar to this year’s
level, said Stuart, who is based in New York. Supplies will
ultimately decline with the approach of an “age of scarcity.”  Oil volume on the Nymex was 528,361 contracts as of 3:07
p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 410,548 contracts yesterday, 41
percent below the average of the past three months. Open
interest was 1.39 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
