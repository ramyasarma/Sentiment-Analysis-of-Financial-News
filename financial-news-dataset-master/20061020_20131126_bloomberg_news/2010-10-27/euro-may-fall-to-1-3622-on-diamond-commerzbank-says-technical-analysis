The euro may decline as low as
$1.3622 should it break below a key support level against the
U.S. currency, Commerzbank AG said, citing technical indicators.  “Euro-dollar remains in consolidation mode and the
potential diamond pattern remains viable,”  Karen Jones , head of
fixed-income, commodity and currency technical analysis at
Commerzbank in London, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “This
will remain the case while intraday rallies are capped by
$1.4057/80.” Jones said that represents the top of a so-called
diamond pattern, which indicates market direction and refers to
the shape drawn by lines through a trading chart’s intraday
highs and lows.  The euro weakened 0.3 percent to $1.3821 as of 9:48 a.m. in
London.  “The near-term risk is for a test and break below the
$1.3805/$1.3775 support,” Jones said. “Below here will trigger
a move to the more important $1.3697/$1.3622 low.” That
represents “the recent low, the April high and the 23.6 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the move up from June,” she said.  A resistance level is an area on a chart where technical
analysts anticipate orders to sell a currency and its related
instruments. The stronger the resistance, the more buying is
needed to advance through that level.  A support level is an area on a chart where technical
analysts anticipate orders to buy a currency and its related
instruments. The stronger the support, the more selling is
needed to drop below that level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
