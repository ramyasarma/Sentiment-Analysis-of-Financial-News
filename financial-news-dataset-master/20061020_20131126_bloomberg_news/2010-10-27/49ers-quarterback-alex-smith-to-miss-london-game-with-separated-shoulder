San Francisco 49ers quarterback  Alex Smith  will miss this weekend’s National Football League game
against the Denver Broncos in London with a separated left
shoulder.  Smith is sidelined for two to three weeks and will be
replaced by  Troy Smith  for the Oct. 31 game at Wembley Stadium.  Alex Smith was injured in last week’s 23-20 loss to
Carolina that dropped San Francisco’s record to 1-6.  David Carr 
replaced him in the game, but 49ers coach  Mike Singletary  chose
to go with Troy Smith against Denver (2-5).  “Troy Smith is our starting quarterback this week,”
Singletary said on the team’s  website . “I think Troy Smith
gives us a good opportunity to win the game.”  Alex Smith has thrown for 1,554 yards with nine touchdowns
and nine interceptions in seven games this season. San Francisco
has a bye next week, meaning he may be able to return for the
team’s game against St. Louis on Nov. 14.  Troy Smith signed with San Francisco in September after
being cut by the Baltimore Ravens. He won the 2006 Heisman
Trophy as college football’s top player while at Ohio State.  To contact the reporter on this story:
