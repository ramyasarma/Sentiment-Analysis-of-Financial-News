Goldcorp Inc. , the world’s second-
largest producer of the metal by market value, said profit
quadrupled on higher metal prices. The company doubled its
annual dividend to 36 cents.  Net income rose to $466.5 million, or 63 cents a share,
from $114.2 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier, Vancouver-
based Goldcorp said today in a statement.  The company said profit excluding gains from the sale of
mining interests and including the impact of foreign-exchange
losses on future tax liabilities was 31 cents. That matched the
average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
climbed 28 percent to $885.8 million from $691.9 million.  Goldcorp, led by Chief Executive Officer  Chuck Jeannes ,
agreed last month to buy Perth-based Andean Resources Ltd. for
C$3.6 billion ($3.5 billion) to gain control of an Argentine
mine. Jeannes plans to boost gold output 58 percent by 2014 with
new mines and expansions.  Gold for immediate delivery in London traded at a record
$1,387 an ounce on Oct. 14. It averaged $1,228 an ounce in the
quarter, 28 percent higher than a year earlier.  Barrick Gold Corp. , based in Toronto, is the world’s
largest gold miner ranked by market capitalization.  (Goldcorp scheduled a conference call for tomorrow at 1
