IAC/InterActiveCorp , operator of
Match.com and Ask.com, said third-quarter profit fell 19
percent, beating analysts’ estimates on growth in its online
dating and search businesses.  Net income at IAC, the Web-based company built and
controlled by  Barry Diller , dropped to $17.5 million, or 32
cents a share on an adjusted basis, from $21.7 million, or 34
cents, a year earlier, as one-time gains weren’t repeated. The
result topped the 27-cent average  estimate  of 16 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Sales increased 25 percent to $421.7 million, the New York-
based company said in a statement. That compares with the $400.1
million analysts had projected.  “It looks like very strong results,”  Sandy Mehta , an
analyst at Hong Kong-based Value Investment Principals Ltd.,
said in an interview. “Everyone is gaga over Google. This is
really the undervalued stock in the space.”  IAC  advanced  $1.12, or 4.2 percent, to $27.59 at 4:30 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has
gained 35 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
