A gold Patek Philippe wristwatch
given by  Michael Jordan  to Chicago Bulls assistant coach Tex
Winter sold for $16,250 today at Sotheby’s in New York, topping
the $12,000 high estimate.  Jordan gave Winter the watch, engraved “Thanks, MJ,” after
the Bulls won the 1997-98 National Basketball Association
Championship. The buyer was an anonymous phone bidder who
trumped two other contenders.  “This is the kind of thing that appeals to both watch
collectors and people who like great provenance,’’ said  Daryn Schnipper , chairman of  Sotheby’s  watch department, after the
Important Watches and Clocks sale. The 194-lot sale totaled $4.9
million, with 168 lots finding buyers.  The top lot was a late-18th-century musical clock by
Francis Perigal in London. A private U.S. collector had the
winning bid of $542,500, just above the $500,000 low estimate. A
1968 Patek Philippe gold wristwatch retailed by  Tiffany & Co. 
fetched $308,500, below the $350,000 high estimate.  The sale began strongly with a cluster of flowery, pearl
encrusted pocket watches that attracted strong bidding from
China and Turkey.  “We’ve known for the last six months that the pocket-watch
market is on fire,’’ said Schnipper. A gold 18th-century enamel
and pearl-inset pocket watch by London maker Charman, decorated
with a bouquet of pink, white and purple flowers, fetched
$62,500, well above its $15,000 high estimate. A circa 1820
Piguet & Meylan enamel musical snuff box and watch, in the form
of a butterfly, brought $266,500, above the $150,000 high
estimate. The buyer was an unnamed European museum.  To contact the reporter on the story:
