The Federal Reserve is likely to
offer a program of U.S. Treasury bond purchases worth a few
hundred billion dollars over the several months at its next
meeting, the Wall Street Journal reported, without saying where
it obtained the information.  The plan, expected to be announced at the conclusion of the
Fed’s Nov. 2-3 meeting, compares with asset-purchase program of
about $2 trillion dollars during the financial crisis, according
to the report. Officials want flexibility in the new program to
gauge if it’s working, the Journal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
