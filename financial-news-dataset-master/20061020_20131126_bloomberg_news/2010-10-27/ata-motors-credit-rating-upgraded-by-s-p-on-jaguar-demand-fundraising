Tata Motors Ltd. , the owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, had its corporate credit rating raised by
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services one level to “BB-” after
boosting vehicle sales and selling shares.  The ratings company also gave Mumbai-based Tata a
“stable” outlook, according to a statement today. “BB-” is
three levels below investment grade.  Moody’s Investors Service yesterday upgraded  Tata  for the
second this time year after the automaker raised $750 million
selling new shares to pare debts.  Tata  also increased vehicle
sales 19 percent in September as the global economic recovery
revived demand.  “We expect Tata Motors to largely maintain its improved
operating performance,” S&P credit analyst Mehul Sukkawala said
in the statement. He cited the company’s dominant position in
India’s truck market, rising local passenger-car sales and
global demand for Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles.  Tata’s ratio of adjusted debt to capital will likely fall
to about 55 percent for the year ending March 31 from 75 percent
a year earlier, S&P said. The truckmaker has 100.3 billion
rupees ($2.3 billion) of  bonds  due through 2025, according to
Bloomberg data.  Tata was little changed at 1,198.90 rupees at 11:20 a.m. in
Mumbai trading. The stock has gained 51 percent this year.  The company said yesterday it will report quarterly
earnings on Nov. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
