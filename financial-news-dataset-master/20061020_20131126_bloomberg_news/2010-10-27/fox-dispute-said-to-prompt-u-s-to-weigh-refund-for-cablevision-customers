U.S. regulators are looking into
whether Cablevision Systems Corp. customers should receive
refunds for programming missed during the cable company’s
dispute with News Corp.’s Fox, a person familiar with the
agency’s deliberations said.  The Federal Communications Commission is considering the
possible refunds, said the person, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the deliberations aren’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
