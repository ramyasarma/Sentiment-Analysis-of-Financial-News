What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 12 cents to 15 cents a bushel lower
on the Chicago Board of Trade as the dollar’s rally reduces the
allure of commodity investments, said  Jeff Thompson  a grain
broker at ABN Amro Clearing LLC in Chicago. Soybean-meal futures
may open $3 to $5 lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to open down 0.6 cent to 0.7 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower as
the dollar gained for the fourth time in five sessions against a
basket of major currencies, Thompson said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as the dollar’s rebound erodes the appeal of U.S.
exports, Thompson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
