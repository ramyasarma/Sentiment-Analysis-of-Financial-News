An overview of activity since
markets closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES  New York: U.S. stocks fell, snapping a five-day gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as government data signaled
business investment will cool and investors speculated
Federal Reserve steps to shore up the economy will be gradual.
*Alcoa Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp. dropped at least 1.8
percent after metal and oil prices declined as the U.S. dollar
rose to a one-week high against the euro.
*Sprint Nextel Corp. slumped 10 percent after posting a wider-
than-estimated loss.
*The S&P 500 dropped 0.9 percent to 1,174.65 at 12:08 p.m. in
New York.  London: U.K. stocks dropped, sending the FTSE 100 Index lower
for a second day, as a fall in raw-material prices weakened
mining shares.
*Rio Tinto led commodity stocks lower.
*CSR Plc slumped 10 percent as the maker of chips used in Nokia
Oyj mobile phones forecast profit for the fourth quarter that
missed estimates.
*The benchmark FTSE 100 fell 61.28, or 1.1 percent, to 5,646.02
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London.  Tokyo: Most Japanese stocks fell, led by banks and brokerages,
as the Wall Street Journal said the scale of U.S. Federal
Reserve asset purchases may be less than anticipated. Exporters
gained as the yen weakened.
*The Topix index fell 0.18 point, or less than 0.1 percent,
to 817.76 at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo.
*The Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 0.1 percent to 9,387.03
after sliding as much as 0.5 percent.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.9
percent to 4,648.10 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index dropped 0.2 percent to 3,280.34 at
the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar advanced against all of its most-traded
counterparts as stocks and longer-term Treasuries fell on
speculation the Federal Reserve will buy less debt than some
traders estimated under quantitative easing.
*The dollar appreciated as much as 0.9 percent to $1.3734 per
euro, the strongest level since Oct. 20, before trading at
$1.3755 at 2:11 p.m. in New York, compared with $1.3859
yesterday.
*The dollar climbed 0.4 percent to 81.74 yen, from 81.43.
*The euro fell 0.4 percent to 112.44 yen, from 112.86.  COMMODITIES  New York: Gold futures closed at the lowest price in three weeks
as the dollar’s rally curbed demand for the precious metal as an
alternative investment.
*Gold futures for December delivery fell $16, or 1.2 percent, to
settle at $1,322.60 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in New
York.  METALS  New York: Copper prices fell from a 27-month high as the
dollar’s rebound curbed demand for commodities as alternative
investments.
*Copper futures for December delivery slid 9.35 cents, or 2.4
percent, to close at $3.7755 a pound at 1:23 p.m. on the Comex
in New York.  OIL  New York: Crude oil dropped after orders for U.S. non-military
goods excluding airplanes declined, signaling that investment
will cool, and the dollar rose against the euro.
*Crude oil for December delivery fell 61 cents to settle at
$81.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  WHAT TO WATCH: New Zealand’s central bank will probably
keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged until next year as
the nation’s worst earthquake in eight decades hobbles growth
and slower consumer spending eases inflation concerns.

Ltd. to hold annual general meetings.
