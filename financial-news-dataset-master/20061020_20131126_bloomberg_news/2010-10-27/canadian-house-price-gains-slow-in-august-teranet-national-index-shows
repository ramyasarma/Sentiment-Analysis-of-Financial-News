The pace of Canadian house price
increases slowed in August, the  Teranet-National Bank  Composite
House Price Index showed.  Prices rose 0.2 percent  during the month , “ the smallest
since the index began climbing 16 months ago,” according to a
report released today by National Bank Financial. Ottawa prices
rose 1.4 percent, followed by a 0.9 percent gain in Halifax,
Nova Scotia, while prices fell in Calgary and Vancouver.  On an  annual basis , prices rose 10.4 percent, the smallest
gain in six months, the report said.  The Bank of Canada said last week that spending on housing
is slowing after the expiry of temporary government stimulus
measures earlier this year.  The Teranet index has tracked home-price changes in six
Canadian cities -- Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary
and Vancouver -- since February 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
