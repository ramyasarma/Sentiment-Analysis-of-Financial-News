Japan’s shipments of rolled-aluminum
products increased 8.5 percent in September, expanding for the
10th straight month, led by demand from can makers.  Supplies to domestic and export markets climbed to 170,443
metric tons from 157,085 tons a year earlier, the Japan
Aluminium Association said in a statement today.  The pace of expansion dropped from 13 percent in August as
shipments to carmakers slowed because of an end to subsidy
payments by the government to buyers of fuel-efficient models
last month, said Koji Iida, head of statistics at the group.  “Demand from the auto industry may weaken further” as
they began cutting domestic production this month to cope with a
slowdown in sales, Iida said today in Tokyo.  Shipments to can makers, the largest aluminum-consuming
sector in Japan, increased 20 percent to 33,913 tons as higher
temperatures last month boosted beverage consumption.  Growth in demand from the auto industry slowed to 15
percent in September from 29 percent in August, when vehicle
sales in Japan surged by the most in 38 years as car buyers took
advantage of government subsidies before the incentive program
expired.  Members of the association include  Furukawa-Sky Aluminum
Corp. ,  Kobe Steel Ltd.  and Nippon Light Metal Co.  Details of output, shipments and inventories are as follows:  To contact the reporters on this story:
