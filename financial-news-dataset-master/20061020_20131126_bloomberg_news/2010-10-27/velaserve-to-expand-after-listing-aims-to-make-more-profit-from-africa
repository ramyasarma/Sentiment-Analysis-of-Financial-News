Mvelaserve Ltd., the South African
security and facilities management company that will sell shares
in Johannesburg next month, aims to expand and earn 20 percent
of its profit outside its home market.  “In three years if 20 percent of our earnings come from
outside South Africa, I will be very happy,” Chief Executive
Officer  Jorge Ferreira  said today in an interview in
Johannesburg. About 95 percent of profit now comes from South
Africa.  Mvelaserve  owns Protea Coin Group, South Africa’s largest
bulk-cash mover and is the country’s biggest provider of
guarding services for mines. The company also provides 7,000
guards to banks in the United Arab Emirates with a local partner
and a similar number in Nigeria, Ferreira said.  The company has identified three acquisition targets and a
deal may be completed after shares start trading on Nov. 29,
Ferreira said. “There are a lot of opportunities,” he said.  Protea Coin may boost its presence in the UAE by providing
cash-in-transit services to banks, Ferreira said. TFMC, Protea’s
facilities management unit, has been contacted about a deal with
Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., he said. TFMC manages 412 sites for  Telkom
South Africa Ltd. , Africa’s largest fixed-line phone company.  The company is considering expansion in Tanzania, Nigeria,
Ghana and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ferreira said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
