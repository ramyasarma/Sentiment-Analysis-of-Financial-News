Japanese  stock   futures  fell after
commodity prices declined, while Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. led gains in Australia’s benchmark index after saying
profit jumped.  American depositary receipts of  Mitsubishi Corp. , Japan’s
largest commodities trader, slid 0.3 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. ADRs of Canon Inc., the world’s largest
camera maker, gained 3.1 percent after the company raised its
profit forecast. Australia & New Zealand Banking climbed 2.5
percent after the lender reported half-year profit that rose 69
percent as bad debts declined.  “Drops in commodity prices following gains in the dollar
should weigh on commodity-related stocks,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in assets in Tokyo at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 9,400 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,410 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,400
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200

0.2 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index slid 0.3 percent yesterday in New York
as investors speculated that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to
shore up the economy will be gradual.  The Fed will probably announce a program to buy several
hundred billion dollars of U.S. Treasury debt over the next few
months, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday, without
saying where it got the information.  Fed Measures  Estimates for the size of the program had ranged from $1
trillion at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Global Research to $2
trillion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., with economists at both
firms agreeing the Fed will likely begin with a $500 billion
plan after the Nov. 2-3 meeting.  “Until we see the results of November’s Federal Reserve
meeting, a cautious stance will prevail,” Ichiyoshi
Investment’s Akino said.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has increased 6.9 percent in
2010, compared with gains of 6 percent by the S&P 500 and 4.4
percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.1 times estimated earnings, compared
with 14 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six

percent, the most since July 1. Copper futures tumbled 2.4

the highest level for a most-active contract since July 2008.  Crude oil for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to $81.94
a barrel in New York yesterday after a report showed U.S. orders
for capital goods declined, and as the dollar strengthened.  The Bank of Japan is scheduled to announce its latest
policy decisions today following a regular meeting.  Tomorrow is the  peak day  for earnings reports in Japan,
with 271 of the 1,662 companies in the Topix scheduled to report
results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter for this story:
