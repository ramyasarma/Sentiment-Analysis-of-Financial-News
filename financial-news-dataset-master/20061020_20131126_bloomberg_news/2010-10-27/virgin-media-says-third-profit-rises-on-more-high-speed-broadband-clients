Virgin Media Inc., the U.K.’s
second-largest pay-television company, said third-quarter
operating profit rose 11 percent as it added more high-speed
broadband subscribers.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
and other charges in the three months ended September rose to
387.3 million pounds, from an adjusted 349 million pounds a year
earlier, the Hook, England-based company said today in an e-
mailed statement. Sales increased 6.4 percent to 978.4 million
pounds, slightly ahead of analysts’ estimates of 971 million
pounds.  “Our continued focus on exploiting our strategic
advantages with the resulting multiple opportunities for revenue
growth, as well as robust financial discipline has delivered
another strong financial performance this quarter,” Chief
Executive Officer Neil Berkett said today in the statement.  Virgin is preparing to start its 100 megabits-per-second
broadband at the end of the year, and said today it will
complete the roll out by the middle of 2012.  The company started a 375 million-pound share buyback
program after it completed its refinancing program and said
today it concluded its first buyback program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
