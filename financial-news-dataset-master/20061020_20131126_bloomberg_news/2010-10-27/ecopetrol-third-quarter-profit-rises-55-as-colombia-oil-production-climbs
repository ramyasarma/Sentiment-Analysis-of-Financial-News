Ecopetrol SA , Colombia’s largest oil
company, said profit climbed 55 percent in the third quarter
because of rising production.  Net income rose to 1.72 trillion pesos ($935 million) from
1.11 trillion pesos a year earlier, the state-controlled company
said yesterday in a statement on the web site of Colombia’s
regulator. Revenue climbed 11 percent to 9.89 trillion pesos.  Bogota-based  Ecopetrol  is exploring new oil fields across
Colombia as it spends more than $80 billion through 2020 to
double crude production. Investment in 2011 will surpass this
year’s planned $6.9 billion in spending, Chief Executive Officer
 Javier Gutierrez  said in an interview this month.  “They are looking at very dynamic growth that may even
exceed their goal,”  Mauricio Restrepo , an analyst at Medellin-
based brokerage Bolsa & Renta, said in a telephone interview
Oct. 25. Restrepo has a “hold” rating on stock and doesn’t own
any shares of Ecopetrol.  Output will rise to 871,000 barrels of oil and natural gas a
day at the end of 2011 from 685,000 barrels at the end of this
year, Ecopetrol said in a July presentation. In 2020, Ecopetrol
plans to pump 1.3 million barrels of oil per day.  To help fund spending, Ecopetrol will probably tap local
debt markets for the first time in more than a decade this
quarter, Gutierrez said in the interview. Ecopetrol plans to
issue $500 million of bonds and may sell a 9.9 percent stake in
2011 or 2012, he said.  Ecopetrol rose 25 pesos, or 0.6 percent, to 4,360 pesos in
Bogota yesterday. The stock has climbed 75 percent this year.
Colombia’s benchmark Colcap index has gained 36 percent in the
same period. The earnings report was released after the close of
regular trading.  Efforts by Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  to weaken
guerrilla groups will help to expand the search for crude and
metals reserves in isolated areas where rebels are hiding out,
Restrepo said.  Rising output at Ecopetrol has made Colombia the third-
largest crude producer in South America, behind Venezuela and
Brazil. Last quarter, oil and gas production at Ecopetrol rose
16 percent from the prior-year period to 632,000 barrels a day.
The figure includes output from units abroad.  The nation’s production will rise to a record 1 million
barrels a day next year, according to the Mines and Energy
Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
