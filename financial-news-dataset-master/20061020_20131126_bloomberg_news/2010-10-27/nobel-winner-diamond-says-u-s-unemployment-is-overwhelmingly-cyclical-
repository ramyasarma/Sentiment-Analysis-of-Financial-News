Nobel-prize winning economist Peter
Diamond said the causes of high unemployment in the U.S. are
“overwhelingly cyclical” rather than structural.  Diamond, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and a nominee to the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors, spoke in a radio interview today on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Tom Keene.  Diamond shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences
for research into the difficulties of matching supply and
demand, particularly in the labor market.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
