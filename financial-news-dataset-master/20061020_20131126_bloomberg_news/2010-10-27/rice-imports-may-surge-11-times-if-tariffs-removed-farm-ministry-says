Japan’s rice imports may surge 11
times from the 770,000 metric tons a year bought now should it
remove tariffs on overseas supplies under a free-trade agreement
with exporters proposed by Prime Minister Naoto Kan.  Japan, self-sufficient in rice, may buy an additional 7.6
million tons a year from overseas should it completely eliminate
tariffs of 341 yen ($4.2) per kilogram, the  Ministry of
Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries said in a report today.  Kan may announce Japan’s participation in the Trans-Pacific
Partnership Agreement with countries including the U.S.,
Australia and Vietnam next month when he chairs the summit of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Cabinet members
including Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said participation in
the pact, under which tariffs are to be eliminated in principle,
is needed to bolster growth amid competition from industrial
exporters such as South Korea.  “Considering the huge impact on domestic farm production,
it looks very difficult for Japan to join the agreement” unless
major farm products including rice are exempted from the removal
of tariffs, said Ruan Wei, chief economist at the Norinchukin
Research Institute Co. in Tokyo.  Agriculture Minister Michihiko Kano told reporters on Oct.
22 the government should consider the importance of agriculture
properly in carrying out its policy.  Central Union of Agricultural Co-Operatives, Japan’s
largest farm lobby, urged ruling party lawmakers including Vice
Agriculture Minister Nobutaka Tsutsui on Oct. 19 they should not
support participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement
as the pact would deal “a fatal blow” to farming.  Wheat, Sugar  The agriculture ministry estimates 679,000 tons of domestic
wheat production, or 90 percent of output, would be replaced by
imports if Japan removes import tariffs of 55 yen per kilogram.  The government also estimates that 869,000 tons of sugar
output and 272,000 tons of beef production would be replaced by
imports should tariffs be eliminated.  Japan agreed to give minimum market access to rice-
exporting countries at the Uruguay Round of world trade talks in
1993, buying 770,000 tons a year.  The country started rice imports under the agreement in the
fiscal year that began in April 1995, and purchased a total of
10.12 million tons in the past 15 years, according to the
ministry. Stockpiles of foreign rice stood at 970,000 tons as of
March 31, down from 1.11 million tons a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
