The euro will rally in the next six
months to a level against the yen last reached a year ago as
Japan remains sensitive to gains in its currency, according to
Faros Trading LLC.  The 16-nation euro has appreciated 0.8 percent since Sept.
15, when Japan ended a six-year policy of refraining from
currency intervention by selling the yen to prevent its gains
from hurting exporters.  “The BOJ is very concerned about the strong Japanese
yen,”  Douglas Borthwick , head of trading at Faros in Stamford,
Connecticut, wrote in a research note to clients.  The euro will rally to 137.28 yen within the next six
months, a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the common
currency’s drop from June 2008 to Aug. 24, 2010, according to
Borthwick. The last time the euro traded at Faros’ target was in
October 2009.  The common currency dropped 0.4 percent to 112.41 yen at
2:02 p.m. in New York, from 112.86 yesterday.  Technical analysts who use the Fibonacci ratios described
by Leonardo of Pisa in “Liber Abaci” in 1202 believe the price
of an asset may reverse an earlier gain or decline after
reaching certain levels.  Among those thresholds are the midpoint between an asset’s
high and low points as well as levels marking the recovery of
61.8 percent, 38.2 percent and 23.6 percent of reversals of the
previous trend.  To contact the reporters on this story:
