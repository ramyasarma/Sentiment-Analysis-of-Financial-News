Leighton Holdings Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest construction company, may find a local partner for its
Indian unit within two months as it seeks to benefit from plans
for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending there.  “We are looking at a major Indian company taking an
investment stake in Leighton India with a view to helping grow
and develop the business within the India market,” Russell
Waugh, managing director of Leighton Contractors (India) Pvt.,
said yesterday in an interview in Mumbai. “We have been working
on that for the last six months or so and it’s fairly advanced
in that process.”  Leighton plans to grow its Indian business fivefold in the
next five years to reach annual turnover of $2 billion a year
from about $400 million now, Waugh said. India is planning to
spend $1 trillion between 2012 and 2017 building roads, ports,
power plants and other infrastructure.  An Indian partner would provide “greater access to funds
to develop projects,” Waugh said. It also “would have its own
captive projects that would help grow the business,” he said,
without identifying any companies.  KPMG is advising Leighton. Waugh said the process should be
complete in 1-2 months.  Leighton Holdings  trades on the Australia stock exchange in
Sydney and the company is controlled by Germany’s Hochtief AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
