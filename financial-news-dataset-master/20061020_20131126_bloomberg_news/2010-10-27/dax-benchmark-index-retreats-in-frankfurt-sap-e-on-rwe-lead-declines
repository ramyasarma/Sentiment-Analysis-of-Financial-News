German stocks retreated for a second
day as disappointing earnings from SAP AG, the world’s biggest
maker of business-management software, offset gains in Deutsche
Bank AG and K+S AG.  SAP retreated 2.8 percent after posting results that missed
forecasts. Beiersdorf AG lost 2.4 percent after ING Groep N
downgraded the shares. Deutsche Bank rose 1 percent after the
lender reported a narrower-than-estimated net loss. K+S rallied
2.4 percent as analysts recommended the fertilizer company.  The benchmark  DAX Index  fell 0.7 percent to 6,568 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, extending yesterday’s 0.4 percent
drop. Steelmakers led the gauge lower yesterday after
ArcelorMittal forecast a drop in fourth-quarter earnings. The
broader  HDAX Index  lost 0.7 percent today.  SAP  dropped 2.8 percent to 37.23 euros after the software
maker reported a 12 percent increase in third-quarter profit to
501 million euros ($691.2 million). That missed analysts’
projection of 553 million euros, according to the average of 16
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “People might have hoped for more” after the recent
strong rise in SAP shares, said Munich-based  Knut Woller , an
analyst at UniCredit SpA. “There is also some profit-taking
after we didn’t see a big surprise.”  Beiersdorf  retreated 2.4 percent to 47.67 euros after ING
lowered its recommendation for the maker of Nivea handcream to
“sell” from “hold.” The company is scheduled to report
earnings next week.  Puma, Deutsche Bank  Puma AG  also retreated in Frankfurt, falling 4.2 percent to
243.60 as analysts downgraded the shares even after the company
yesterday raised its earnings forecast. CA Cheuvreux SA lowered
its recommendation to “underperform” from “outperform” while
Kepler cut its rating to “hold” from “buy.”  Deutsche Bank  climbed 1 percent to 41.59 euros. The shares
earlier rose as much as 2.4 percent after Germany’s biggest bank
reported a third-quarter loss that was smaller than estimated as
higher profit at the investment bank cushioned a writedown on
its Deutsche Postbank AG stake.  The bank’s 1.21 billion-euro net loss compares with a 1.38
billion-euro profit a year earlier. Analysts predicted a 1.52
billion-euro loss after Deutsche Bank said on Sept. 21 that it
would book a 2.3 billion-euro charge related to Postbank.  K+S  gained 2.4 percent to 49.41 euros after analysts
recommended Europe’s biggest producer of potash. Citigroup Inc.
and UniCredit SpA both upgraded the shares to “buy” from
“hold” and “sell” respectively. WestLB AG raised its
recommendation to “add” from “neutral.”  Deutsche Lufthansa AG also advanced after Europe’s second-
largest carrier boosted nine-month profit 17-fold to 524 million
euros on a recovery in demand for passenger and cargo transport.
The airline, which also raised its full-year forecast, advanced
1.9 percent to 15.43 euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
