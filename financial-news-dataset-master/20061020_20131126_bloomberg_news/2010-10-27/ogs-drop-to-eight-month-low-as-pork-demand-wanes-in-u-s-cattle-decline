Hog prices slumped to an eight-month
low on signs that U.S. supplies are increasing amid waning
demand. Cattle prices also dropped.  In the week ended Oct. 23, slaughtered hogs in Iowa and
Southern Minnesota, the main producing region, weighed 0.5
percent more than a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. Yesterday, the  wholesale pork-cutout  price, a gauge
of consumer demand, fell to the lowest level since April.  “The production continues to swamp the demand,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des
Moines, Iowa. “The cutout continues to fall apart,” Roose
said.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.825 cent, or 1.2
percent, to settle at 67.85 cents a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 67.35
cents, the lowest level for a most-active contract since Feb.
11.  Yesterday, wholesale pork dropped 1.1 percent to 75.14
cents a pound, the lowest level since April 5. The price
reflects a weighted average of cuts including bellies, ribs and
hams.  Futures dropped as the dollar’s rebound eroded the appeal
of commodities. The greenback rose as much as 0.7 percent
against a basket of currencies, and the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials dropped as much
as 1.4 percent.  “It’s also a commodities-negative day when you’ve got the
dollar slightly firmer and the metals and energies lower,”
Roose said.  Cattle futures for December delivery dropped 0.1 cent, or
0.1 percent, to settle at $1 a pound. The price dropped for the
third straight session, the longest slump in a month. The
commodity has gained 16 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement fell 0.15
cent, or 0.1 percent, to $1.11775 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
