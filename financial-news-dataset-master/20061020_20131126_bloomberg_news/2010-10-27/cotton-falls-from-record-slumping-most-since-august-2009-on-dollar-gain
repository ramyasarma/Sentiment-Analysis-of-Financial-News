(Corrects first paragraph to show orange juice rose, not
fell.)  Cotton futures plunged the most in
14 months as the dollar’s rally reduced demand for raw materials
as alternative assets. Orange juice rose.  The fiber tumbled 6 cents a pound, the most allowed by ICE
Futures U.S., after yesterday reaching $1.305, the highest level
since the commodity started trading 140 years ago. The  greenback 
gained for the fourth time in five sessions against a basket of
major currencies. Cotton has climbed 63 percent this year as
global supplies trailed demand.  “While the U.S. Dollar Index is slightly stronger,
commodity markets are generally lower, with cotton leading the
way,”  Andy Ryan , a senior risk-management consultant at FCStone
Fibers & Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee, said in a report.  Cotton for December delivery fell 4.6 percent to settle at
$1.2359 at 2:44 p.m. on ICE in New York, the biggest decline
since Aug. 14, 2009.  Bookings for capital goods fell in September, signaling a
slowdown in U.S. business investment that gives the Federal
Reserve more reason to ease monetary policy next week. Cotton
and industrial metals drove the  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index  lower today.  As of yesterday, cotton inventories monitored by ICE rose
37 percent to 12,181 bales from 8,910 bales on Oct. 8, this
year’s lowest level. Supplies have tumbled from 1.08 million
bales, the 2010 high on June 2, amid surging demand from China,
the world’s biggest buyer. The U.S. is the leading exporter.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery gained 1.85
cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $1.512 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
