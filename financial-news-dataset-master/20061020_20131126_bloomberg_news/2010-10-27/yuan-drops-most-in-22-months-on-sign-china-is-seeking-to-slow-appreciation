China’s yuan declined by the most in
22 months on speculation the government wants to slow the pace
of appreciation to bolster exports after setting a lower
reference rate for daily trading.  Finance ministers and central banks from the Group of 20
nations said last week they would refrain from “competitive
devaluations” and allow markets to determine exchange rates.
The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s reference rate at
6.6912 per dollar today, the lowest level since Sept. 30. The
Dollar  Index  traded on ICE futures in New York, which tracks the
greenback against currencies of six major trading partners, rose
for a second day.  “The slump in the fixing is a bit surprising even given
the dollar’s strength overnight,” said  Jinny Yan , an economist
at Standard Chartered Plc in Shanghai. “Since the G-20 meeting
is over, the Chinese authorities may want the appreciation to
take some rest. We should prepare for more two-way volatility in
the next few weeks.”  The yuan declined 0.25 percent to 6.6795 per dollar as of
10:17 a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. That was the biggest fall since December 2008. The
yuan has weakened 0.31 percent this week, after strengthening by
2.3 percent between Sept. 1 and Oct. 22.  China’s 2010 trade surplus will “definitely” be smaller
than in 2009, Vice Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said yesterday.
Exports  exceeded  imports by $17 billion in September, the
smallest monthly surplus in five months, bringing this year’s
total trade balance to $121 billion, according to customs bureau
data on Oct. 13.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.4 percent
to 6.5050 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency will
strengthen 2.6 percent over the next year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The central bank will ensure that appreciation is
gradual,” said  Dariusz Kowalczyk , a Hong Kong-based economist
and strategist for Credit Agricole CIB. “There will be not more
than 3 percent appreciation per year.”  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  Simon Harvey   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
