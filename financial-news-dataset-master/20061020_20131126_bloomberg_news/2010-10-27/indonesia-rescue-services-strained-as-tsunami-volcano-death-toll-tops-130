Tsunami survivors in Indonesia’s
remote west received tents other supplies today, and aid workers
fed and provided necessities to evacuees from a volcanic
eruption as the number of dead from the two disasters rose.  The death toll as of 4 p.m. local time from the Oct. 25
tsunami that hit the Mentawai Islands off the west coast of
Sumatra reached 343 and the number of missing fell to 338 as
rescuers found more bodies, the National Disaster Management
said on its website.  Bread, milk, tents and clothes arrived via ships from
Padang and more is on the way from Jakarta, Maria, a volunteer
at the West Sumatra Regional Disaster Agency command post, said
by phone. A transport plane that will carry supplies tomorrow
arrived in Padang today, she said.  “We need food, medicines,” Maria, who goes by one name,
said. “Some areas cannot be reached by cars. We’ve been able to
reach those places with whatever it takes, by motorcycles or
some even walking.”  In Central Java, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
Jakarta, Red Cross Indonesia workers are treating people who
were burned or otherwise injured after the Mount Merapi volcano
erupted three times Oct. 26, spewing superheated ash.  The death toll rose to 34 with two others missing, and
39,564 people are staying at evacuation centers, the disaster
management agency said on its website.  A small eruption occurred today, Surono, an official at the
country’s Volcanology and Geology Disaster Mitigation Center,
said by phone. No injuries were reported.  3-Meter Tsunami  The 7.5-magnitude temblor struck the Kepulauan Mentawai of
Indonesia, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) from Padang, the
provincial capital of West Sumatra, and 640 kilometers from
Singapore at 9:42 p.m. local time Oct. 25, the US Geological
Survey said. The quake triggered a 3-meter (10-foot) tsunami
that that reached 400 meters inland, the agency said Oct. 26.  President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  returned yesterday from
a regional summit in Hanoi to travel to the disaster zone, said
 Julian Pasha , a presidential spokesman.  Indonesia, a country of more than 17,000 islands, is prone
to earthquakes as it forms part the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of
volcanoes and fault lines surrounding the Pacific Basin.  A 7.6-magnitude earthquake in the same area in October 2009
left more than 1,000 people dead in Padang, many of whom were
buried in mudslides and the rubble of collapsed buildings. Less
than a month earlier, a magnitude-7 temblor south of Java on
Sept. 2 left 82 people dead.  199,000 Tons of TNT  A magnitude 7 earthquake carries about as much as energy as
199,000 tons of TNT, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  A tsunami generated by a magnitude-9.1 earthquake off
northern Sumatra in December 2004 left about 220,000 people dead
or missing in 12 countries around the Indian Ocean.  Since the December 2004 quake and tsunami, countries
including Thailand, Malaysia and India have been installing
detection buoys and setting up warning networks.  The system consists of seismological stations and deep-sea
sensors, linked to more than 20 information analysis centers
capable of receiving and distributing tsunami advisories.  Many coastal areas have been equipped with sirens or other
alarms to warn of approaching waves.  Indonesia has had two of the world’s biggest volcanic
eruptions in the past 200 years, Mount Tambora in 1815 and
Krakatau in 1883.  To contact the reporters on this story:
