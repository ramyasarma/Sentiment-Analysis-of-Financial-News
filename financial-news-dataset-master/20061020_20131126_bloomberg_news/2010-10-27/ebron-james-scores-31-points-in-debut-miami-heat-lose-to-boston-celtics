LeBron James  scored 31 points
in his debut for the Miami Heat and ended up on the losing
team as the Boston Celtics took the National Basketball
Association season opener 88-80.  James had five more points than the other four Heat
starters combined last night at TD Garden in Boston, where
 Ray Allen  led the Celtics with 20 points and  Paul Pierce 
had 19.  “It’s going to take time and we understand that,”
James told reporters. “Right now it’s a feel-out process.
It almost felt like we were being too unselfish, trying to
get each other into the game.”  James, the two-time reigning NBA Most Valuable Player,
left the Cleveland Cavaliers in July after seven seasons to
join fellow All-Stars  Dwyane Wade  and  Chris Bosh  at the
Heat. The arrival of James and Bosh, and Wade’s decision to
stay, led Las Vegas oddsmakers to install the Heat as the
odds-on favorite to win the NBA title for the first time
since 2006.  James got Miami’s first two baskets before the home
team took the lead for good on a 3-pointer by Pierce 4
minutes, 32 seconds into the game. The Celtics led by 19
points with 2:13 left in the first half and held a 45-30
halftime advantage.  The Heat rallied after the break and trailed 83-80
with 1:09 to play on a 3-pointer by James, who tallied 21
points in the second half.  It was as close as Miami got. Allen made a 3-pointer
and Pierce hit two free throws to wrap up the scoring.  No Panic  “We knew we wouldn’t necessarily hit on all cylinders
right away,” Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  told reporters.
“It’s not a reason to panic.”  Wade added 13 points and Bosh, who elected to join
Miami from the Toronto Raptors as a free agent a day before
James announced his team choice, contributed eight points.  “It was fun,” Boston’s  Rajon Rondo  said in a
televised interview. “We got off to a great start.”  Also on the opening night of the season, the Portland
Trail Blazers won 106-92 against the visiting Phoenix Suns
and the Los Angeles Lakers began defense of their NBA title
by winning 112-110 at home against the Houston Rockets.  Brandon Roy  had 24 points to lead Portland, which
outscored Phoenix 31-11 in the fourth period to seal the
win at the Rose Garden in Portland.  Steve Nash  had 26
points for the Suns.  Pau Gasol  had 29 points,  Kobe Bryant  added 27 and
 Steve Blake  made a 3-pointer with 18 seconds left to give
the Lakers the victory.  Kevin Martin  had 26 points for the
Rockets at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.  Yao Ming , Houston’s 7-foot-6, 310-pound (2.29 meter,
141 kilogram) center who missed last season with a foot
injury and is in the final year of his contract, had nine
points and 11 rebounds in 23 minutes for the Rockets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
