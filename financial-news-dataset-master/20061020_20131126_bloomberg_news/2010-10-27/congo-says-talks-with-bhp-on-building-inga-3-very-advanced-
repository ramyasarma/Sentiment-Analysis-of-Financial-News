The Democratic Republic of Congo’s
government is in “very advanced” talks with  BHP Billiton Ltd. 
on the Inga 3 hydropower project, as the world’s biggest mining
company seeks electricity for a possible aluminum smelter.  Congo formally invited offers to build the project on the
Congo River yesterday, Energy Minister Gilbert Tshiongo
Tshibinkubula wa Tumba said today in Kinshasa, the capital. BHP,
studying development of a smelter in the country, is continuing
talks with the government on both ventures, which are at an
“early conceptual phase,” Rosheeka Amarasekara, a London-based
spokeswoman for the company, said by telephone.  Inga 3 is part of the planned $22 billion Inga power
complex, estimated to generate about 40,000 megawatts, almost
twice the capacity of China’s Three Gorges dam. A previous
proposal for the 5,000-megawatt Inga 3, estimated to cost $5.2
billion, was shelved when Western Power Corridor, a venture
between five African countries, was dissolved.  “BHP could potentially support the development of Inga 3
by constructing an aluminum smelter in the Bas Congo province
which could source power from the Inga 3 hydropower scheme,”
Amarasekara said. The company can’t provide estimates on output
or costs, she said.  BHP Smelter  BHP said in 2007 its plant could use about 2,000 megawatts
of power from the proposed Inga 3 project and produce 800,000
metric tons of the metal a year.  “While waiting for the construction of Inga 3, Congo will
face a deficit in 2015 in the order of 858 megawatts as demand
rises, notably the demand of miners,” the energy minister said
today. The country wants Inga 3 to be operational by 2020, he
said, adding that 3,500 megawatts to 4,200 megawatts will be
“prioritized” for  BHP ’s smelter.  The nation needs $6.4 billion over the next five years to
rehabilitate and build its electricity network. Congo is seeking
$22 billion between 2015 and 2025 for Inga 3 and the Grand Inga
dam, which would harness the power of the Congo River, the
second-biggest by volume after the Amazon.  Congo’s rivers could produce more than 100,000 megawatts at
341 different sites, the minister said. Only 2.5 percent of
their energy potential is currently being exploited. Congo has
2.463 megawatts of hydropower installed and 1.382 is being used,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
