Julie Dickson said Canada’s banking
regulator will publish results of its analysis of the capital-
framework review for the property and casualty insurance
industry in December.  The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
will release the results of its analysis for consultation before
the end of the year, Dickson, the country’s top banking
regulator, said in a speech in  Quebec City  today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
