China has a total wind turbine
project pipeline of more than 170 gigawatts in different stages
of development, MAKE Consulting said in a report.  The Chinese market will grow by a compound annual growth
rate of 17 percent between 2010 and 2015 and will account for
some 38 percent of the global wind power market in five years,
the Hoejbjerg, Denmark-based industry consultant said in a note
on its website today.  “The near term development will primarily take place
onshore in North China as the most significant region followed
by Northeast, East and Northwest China,” MAKE said. “Also the
Chinese offshore project pipeline is rapidly expanding
accounting for most of the pipeline in East China.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
