Wells Fargo & Co. said it will
submit supplemental affidavits for about 55,000 foreclosures
pending in courts after finding instances where the final step
in the affidavit execution didn’t adhere to required procedures.  Wells Fargo said it doesn’t believe those instances led to
any foreclosures that shouldn’t have occurred.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
