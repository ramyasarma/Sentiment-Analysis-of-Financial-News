Centro Property Group will seek bids
for A$4 billion of Australian shopping centers before Christmas,
the Australian Financial Review reported, without citing anyone.
The group of more than 40 assets is held primarily by the Centro
Australia Wholesale Fund and the listed Centro Retail Trust, the
newspaper said. Stockland, Lend Lease Group, Colonial First
State Global Asset Management and AMP Capital Investors are
among potential bidders, according to the report. The assets
aren’t expected to be sold at a discount, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
