Norway’s krone declined to the
weakest level in a week against the dollar after the central
bank said it will delay plans to increase borrowing costs.  Norwegian policy makers echoed concerns voiced by their
peers at Sweden’s Riksbank, who yesterday said a sluggish
recovery and low borrowing costs in the U.S. and Europe will
delay their plans to continue raising interest rates next year.
Norges Bank pushed its next rate increase into 2011, compared
with a previous forecast for the “turn of the year.” The Oslo-
based bank also left its benchmark deposit rate unchanged today
at 2 percent for a fourth meeting.  “The Riksbank revision to their interest rate path was a
genuine surprise,” said  Arne Lohmann Rasmussen , head of
currency research at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “Today it
was very much expected that we’d see a downward revision to the
interest-rate path.”  The krone declined 0.7 percent to 5.9055 per dollar at 4:47
p.m. in London. It earlier slid to 5.9253, the weakest since
Oct. 20. It depreciated 0.2 percent to 8.1423 versus the euro.  The Swedish currency declined by 0.1 percent to 9.3381
against the euro, after slumping to 9.3626, the weakest level in
nearly three weeks. It depreciated by 0.6 percent to 6.7742 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
