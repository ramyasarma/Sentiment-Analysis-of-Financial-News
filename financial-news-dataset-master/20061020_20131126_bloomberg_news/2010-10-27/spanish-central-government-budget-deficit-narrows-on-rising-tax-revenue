Spain’s central government  budget 
deficit narrowed by 42 percent in the first nine months as tax
revenue surged and spending cuts took effect.  The  shortfall  fell to 3.45 percent of gross domestic
product from 5.96 percent a year earlier, the Madrid-based
Finance Ministry said in a statement on its  website  today. Tax
revenue on a cash basis rose 13.5 percent from a year earlier
and personnel costs rose 2.7 percent.  The overall  budget gap , which was 11.1 percent of GDP last
year, also includes the regional administrations’ shortfall and
the balance of the social security system, which had a surplus
of 0.9 percent of GDP in the first nine months, the Labor
Ministry said today. In the first half, the overall deficit fell
to 3.54 percent of GDP from 3.86 percent a year earlier, the
Finance Ministry said in a separate  report  today.  Spain, which emerged from an almost two-year  recession  in
the first half, is cutting spending and increasing taxes to rein
in the third-largest budget deficit in the euro region. The
 government  reduced public workers’ wages by 5 percent in June
and raised value-added tax in July as part of the deepest
austerity program in at least three decades.  Pressure on the budget from higher borrowing costs is
easing as the  extra yield  investors demand to hold Spanish bonds
rather than German equivalents was at 158.8 basis points today,
down from a euro-era high of 221.2 basis points in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
