Peru’s sol fell to its weakest level
in eight weeks as speculation that any Federal Reserve program
to boost the U.S. economy will be gradual curbed demand for
emerging-market assets.  The sol weakened 0.2 percent to 2.7995 per U.S. dollar at
1:30 p.m. New York time, from 2.7944 yesterday. That’s the
lowest on an intraday basis since Aug. 27.  The U.S. central bank may limit bond purchases to a few
hundred billion dollars at next week’s meeting, the Wall Street
Journal reported, without saying where it got the information.
Speculation the Fed’s package may not be sufficient to boost the
world’s largest economy has increased aversion to risk, said
 Roberto Flores , an economist at Inteligo SAB in Lima.  “That’s having an impact on emerging-market currencies,”
including the sol, Flores said. “Some local banks are
increasing their dollar positions in the face of this
speculation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
