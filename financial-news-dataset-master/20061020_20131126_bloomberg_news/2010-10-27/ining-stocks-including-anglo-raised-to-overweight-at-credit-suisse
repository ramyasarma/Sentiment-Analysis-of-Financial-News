Mining stocks worldwide were raised
to “overweight” from “benchmark” by Credit Suisse Group AG
strategists, who said the Federal Reserve and other central
banks’ monetary easing will create a “bubble” in assets and
liquidity in emerging markets.  The Swiss bank also improved its view on basic-resources
stocks given the outlook for global industrial purchases, growth
in China, a weaker dollar, and “reasonable” valuations, it
wrote in a report today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
