TMX Group Inc., owner of the Toronto
Stock Exchange, is “exploring options” for growth and is open
to “looking at a lot of different things” to boost shareholder
value including acquisitions, said Chief Executive Officer
Thomas Kloet. Kloet was responding to a question on a conference
call today about the bid by Singapore Exchange Ltd. to buy
Australia’s main bourse. Kloet said he is watching that takeover
closely. “We have proven to be an excellent partner,” said
Kloet, a former executive at the Singapore exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
