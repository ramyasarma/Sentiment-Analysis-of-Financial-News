Foreign ownership in  Malaysia’s 
stock market climbed to a two-year high amid record fund flows
to emerging markets, according to CIMB Investment Bank Bhd.  Foreign funds bought $129 million of  Malaysian shares  last
month, after outflows of $112.4 million in August, CIMB analyst
 Terence Wong  said, citing EPFR Global, which collects data from
more than 600 funds. Their holdings in the market rose 0.5
percentage points to 21.7 percent, the highest level since
September 2008, he said, citing stock exchange data.  September’s fund flows bring net purchases in the Southeast
Asian nation to $186 million so far this year, exceeding last
year’s total of $158 million, said Wong, who was ranked the
third-best analyst in Malaysia by Institutional Investor
magazine in 2010. He kept his “overweight” rating on the
market and his end-2011 index target of 1,610 points.  “Emerging markets are hot, foreigners are coming in and
Malaysia is a recipient of that,” Wong said in a phone
interview today. Still, “we’re lagging behind some of our
neighbors like Indonesia and Thailand, which are up double that
this year.”  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  rose 0.3 percent to
1,501.13 at 10:07 a.m. local time, set for its highest close
since Jan. 15, 2008 and near its record close of 1,516.22 on
Jan. 11, 2008. It has risen 18 percent this year, trailing
behind benchmark indexes in Indonesia and the Philippines, which
have surged more than 40 percent. Thailand’s stock gauge has
climbed 36 percent.  Record Inflows  Funds that invest in global emerging-market equities drew
record inflows in the third week of October, according to EPFR
Global. The funds took in $3.8 billion in the week ending Oct.
20, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research company said in
an e-mailed statement.  “It’s a very clear signal that developed countries are
underperforming and emerging markets are outperforming,” Wong
said. Malaysian government efforts to transform the economy are
also helping to bolster the stock market, he said.  Malaysian Prime Minister  Najib Razak  said in his Oct. 14
budget speech that the government plans a 100-floor tower and a
mass rail project to boost spending and spur growth.  “Foreign funds will remain net buyers in October as the
stock index scaled new highs for the year,” Wong said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
