Equity Bank Ltd., a Kenyan lender,
was rated “buy” in new coverage at Sterling Investment Bank
Ltd.  “We expect the bank to significantly grow its loan book as
it focuses more on small businesses and mortgages,” Nairobi-
based Sterling said in an e-mailed note to clients yesterday.
“The bank’s margins are also expected to improve substantially
with less drain from the subsidiaries which are turning
around.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
