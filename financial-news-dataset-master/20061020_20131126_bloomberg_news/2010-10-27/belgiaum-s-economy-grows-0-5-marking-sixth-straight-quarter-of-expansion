The economy of Belgium, the sixth-
largest in the euro zone, expanded for a sixth quarter in the
three months through September.  The economy expanded 0.5 percent from the second quarter,
when it grew an upwardly revised 1 percent, the  National Bank of
Belgium  in Brussels said today. The economy grew 2.1 percent
from a year earlier after an upwardly revised annual gain of 2.6
percent in the second quarter.  “This is very good news for the whole euro zone because it
could also be the case for Germany and other core euro-zone
countries,” said  Philippe Ledent , an economist at  ING Groep NV 
in Brussels.  European industrial orders increased more than twice as
much as economists forecast in August, indicating the region’s
economy continues to recover from the worst crisis in at least
six decades. At the same time, economic growth may be hurt as
governments cut spending to meet European Union deficit rules.  Business confidence in Belgium and neighboring Germany,
Europe’s biggest economy, unexpectedly rose in October. Germany
is one of Belgium’s main trading partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
