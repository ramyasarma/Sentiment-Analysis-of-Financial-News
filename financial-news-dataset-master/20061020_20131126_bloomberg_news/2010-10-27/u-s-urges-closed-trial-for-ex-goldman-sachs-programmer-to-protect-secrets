The trial of a former  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  computer programmer should be held in part behind
closed doors to protect the securities firm’s trade secrets,
prosecutors said.  The government will introduce evidence at the trial, which
is scheduled to start Nov. 29, to show that information  Sergey Aleynikov  is accused of stealing were Goldman Sachs trade
secrets, prosecutors said in a filing yesterday in federal court
in Manhattan. Aleynikov’s defense will try to show the
information wasn’t secret, prosecutors said.  Prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge  Denise Cote  to close
the courtroom to the public when this evidence is presented.
They also asked that trial exhibits “describing or containing”
 Goldman Sachs ’s trade secrets shouldn’t be made publicly
available, so that both sides can present their evidence without
compromising any of the firm’s proprietary information.  Aleynikov, who worked as a programmer at Goldman Sachs from
May 2007 through June of 2009, is accused of copying hundreds of
thousands of lines of computer source code related to the firm’s
high-frequency trading business on his last day of work.
Aleynikov told federal investigators that he intended only to
copy “open source” code not owned by Goldman Sachs, according
to the prosecutors’ court filing.  Aleynikov’s lawyer,  Kevin Marino , declined to comment.  The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 10-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
