Italian investors reduced their
holdings of government bonds and corporate stocks this year with
almost 70 percent keeping their savings in cash on expectations
that the financial crisis is not over, a survey  showed.    The number of consumers holding stock fell to 7 percent
from 8 percent last year, savings-bank association ACRI said in
the survey released today. About 7 percent of Italians invested
in government bonds this year, down from 8 percent in 2009. The
number of Italians keeping their savings in cash rose to 68
percent from 62 percent last year, the survey showed.  “The survey confirms the general picture of Italians as big
savers and people who are risk-averse,” Acri Chairman  Giuseppe Guzzetti  told reporters in Rome today.  The country’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index  gained 6.2 percent
in the third quarter, while 10-year  government bonds  fell 5.3
percent during the same period.  “Government bonds look less appealing today, given the low
level of  yield ,” said Andrea Alemanno, who directed the survey
for research institute Ipsos Srl. “Stocks also look less
attractive.”  The survey of 1,000 consumers took place between Sept. 28
and Oct. 3. The margin of error was between 0.6 and 3.1
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
