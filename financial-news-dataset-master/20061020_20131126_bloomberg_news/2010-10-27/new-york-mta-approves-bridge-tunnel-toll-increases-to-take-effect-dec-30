New York’s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority approved raising tolls at bridges and
two tunnels as part of an initiative to raise revenue by 7.5
percent next year. The increase will take effect Dec. 30.  MTA board members, by a vote of 12-to-1, increased cash
tolls by $1 per car or van to $6.50 at seven major crossings,
Aaron Donovan, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. Tolls on the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge between Staten Island and Brooklyn,
which are collected in one direction, will increase $2 to $13.  Drivers who use E-ZPass electronic tolling will have their
tolls increased by 5 percent to $4.80 at major crossings.  The major crossings are: the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge,
Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, Queens Midtown Tunnel, RFK Bridge,
Throgs Neck Bridge and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Cash tolls on
the smaller Henry Hudson Bridge and Rockaway crossings will
increase 50 cents.  The MTA approved bus and subway fare increases earlier this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
