Mortgage-bond investors represented
by Dallas lawyer  Talcott Franklin  will send letters to
securities trustees complaining that they shouldn’t bear the
costs of loan servicers’ so-called robo-signing.  The investors, who Franklin has said own more than $500
billion of the securities, are “pretty disturbed” that
 mortgage -bond trusts are being forced to pay penalties after
loan servicers including  Detroit-based Ally Financial Inc.  filed
false affidavits in foreclosure cases, he said. Judges are
forcing the trusts to cover homeowners’ attorney fees when
servicer misdeeds are discovered, he said.  “Look who got sanctioned,” Franklin said today at a
conference in New York organized by law firm Grais & Ellsworth
LLP. “It wasn’t the servicer, it was the holder of the note.”  Franklin said the group of investors coordinating through
his firm’s RMBS Investor Clearing House now own more than 25
percent of so-called voting rights for about 2,600 mortgage
securitizations, and more than 50 percent for about 1,150 deals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
