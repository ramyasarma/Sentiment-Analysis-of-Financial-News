Corn and soybeans fell for the first
time this week as a stronger dollar reduced investment demand
for commodities as alternative assets.  The dollar advanced against most major currencies on
speculation that the Federal Reserve will buy less U.S. debt
than some traders estimated. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of 19 raw materials dropped as much as 1.4 percent, led by
a 4.6 percent decline in cotton.  “The stronger dollar is driving funds to cut longs in
commodities today,” said  Brian Grete , the senior market analyst
for Professional Farmers of America newsletter in Cedar Falls,
Iowa.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 4.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $5.6625 a bushel at 11:06 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of trade. The price touched $5.88 on Oct. 13, the highest level
since August 2008.  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 6.75 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $12.2425 a bushel in Chicago. Earlier, the
commodity touched $12.405, the highest level since September
2008.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion last
year, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
