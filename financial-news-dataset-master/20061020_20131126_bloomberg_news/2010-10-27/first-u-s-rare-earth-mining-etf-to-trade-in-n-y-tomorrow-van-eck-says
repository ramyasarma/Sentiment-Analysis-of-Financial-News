The first U.S. exchange-traded fund
linked to companies producing rare-earth elements and strategic
metals will begin trading in New York tomorrow, according to
Harvey Hirsch, a senior vice president at  Van Eck Associates
Corp. , the issuer of the security.  The ETF will track an index that consists of 24 mining
companies including  Iluka Resources Ltd. , the world’s largest
zircon producer, and  Titanium Metals Corp. , Van Eck said in a
report. The launch price will be $20, and the ticker for the
fund listed on the NYSE Arca stock exchange will be REMX, the
New York-based money manager said.  Rare-earth prices have jumped after China, the source of
more than 90 percent of worldwide supplies, cut its second-half
export quota. The group of 17 metallic elements, such as
lanthanum, cerium, neodymium and europium, are used in petroleum
refining, fiber-optic transmission, and military radar and
missile-guidance systems.  Forty-nine elements in the periodic table are considered
strategic metals, including certain rare-earth metals, said Van
Eck, which created the first U.S. gold-mining ETF in 2006.  China Rare Earth Holdings Ltd., a manufacturer and
wholesaler of rare-earth products traded in Hong Kong, is also
in the index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
