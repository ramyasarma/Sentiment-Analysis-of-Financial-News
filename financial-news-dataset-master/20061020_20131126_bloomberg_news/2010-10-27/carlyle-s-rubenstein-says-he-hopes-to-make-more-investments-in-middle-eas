David Rubenstein , co-founder of the
Carlyle Group, said the firm is looking to make more investments
in the expanding markets of the Middle East and North Africa.  “We are hoping to make a number of additional
investments” this year or next, Rubenstein said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television at the World Economic Forum in
Marrakesh, Morocco. “We are looking at manufacturing, we’re
looking at health care, looking at financial services.”  The economies of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East
and North Africa are expected to expand 3.8 percent this year
while the economies of oil importers in the region, along with
Afghanistan and Pakistan, are forecast to grow 5 percent,
according to the Washington-based International Monetary Fund.
That compares with the U.S.’s expected 2.6 percent growth.  Washington-based Carlyle Group raised $500 million for its
first Middle East and North Africa fund in March last year after
seeking as much as twice that amount. The company said March 29
it bought a 30 percent stake in General Lighting Co., Saudi
Arabia’s biggest lighting-fixtures manufacturer, without
disclosing its price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
