Italian banks are working with the
country’s ministry of finance and central bank as they consider
an exemption from rules drafted by the Basel Committee on

 Giuseppe Mussari, chairman of the Italy’s banking association,
said that the treatment of “deferred tax assets” concerns
Italian banks and involves a “sizeable amount,” he told
reporters in Rome today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
