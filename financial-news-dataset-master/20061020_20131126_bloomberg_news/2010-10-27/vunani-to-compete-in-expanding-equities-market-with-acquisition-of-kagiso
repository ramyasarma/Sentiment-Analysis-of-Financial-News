Vunani Ltd. , the financial services
company, wants to buy competitor Kagiso Securities as
competition in South Africa’s equities market intensifies.  “We’re trying to make sure we’ve got the weight to fight
the competition,” Ethan Dube, chief executive officer of
Vunani, said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg today.
By combining  Kagiso Securities  with Vunani’s stock-broking unit
the company will save money, strengthen its coverage and double
the size of its equities team, Dube said.  With Africa expected to grow faster than more developed
regions, companies like  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and Credit Suisse
AG are building equities teams in South Africa to take advantage
of increased investor focus on the continent. Johannesburg-based
 Barnard Jacobs Mellet Holdings Ltd.  agreed to sell its
securities unit to Renaissance Capital in May while the
Financial Mail magazine reported in September that Bank of
America Corp.’s South African unit plans to boost hires.  Vunani’s due diligence on Kagiso Securities will be
completed “within weeks” so as not to cause Kagiso’s staff too
much uncertainty, Dube said, declining to add details about
cost. Vunani, which has about 20 people in its securities
business, is also hoping to tap into more African markets
through joint ventures, with alliances already set up in
Botswana and Zimbabwe, he said.  Vunani, which listed its shares on Johannesburg’s stock
exchange in 2007, has dropped 30 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
