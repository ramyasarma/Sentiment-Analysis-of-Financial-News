Soybeans rose to a two-year high on
speculation that China, the largest consumer of vegetable oils,
will increase oilseed imports to cool food inflation.  China bought 250,000 metric tons of soybean oil from South
America this week, industry website Grain.gov.cn said today. A
commodities rally in China ended on concerns that government
regulators may tighten trading rules to curb speculation.  Food
prices  in the world’s most populous nation climbed 8 percent in
September from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics
said Oct. 21.  “The only way China will slow inflation is to import more
food,” said Ben Buckner, an analyst for AgResource Co. in
Chicago. “China will continue to buy U.S. soybeans,” reducing
reserve inventories before next year’s harvest, Buckner said.  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 5 cents, or
0.4 percent, to close at $12.36 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $12.405, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Sept. 4, 2008.
The commodity has gained 36 percent since July 1 on rising
Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans.  In the week ended Oct. 14, U.S. soybean sales surged 85
percent to 2.02 million tons from a week earlier, according to
the USDA. About 72 percent of the total went to China. Since
then, exporters reported sales of 1.61 million tons to China or
unknown destinations, USDA data show.  Soybean-crushing capacity in China may increase 11 million
tons to more than 95 million tons in the 2010-2011 marketing
year from a year earlier, Grain.gov.cn said today in a report.  Before today,  Chinese profit margins  on crushing soybeans
more than doubled this year as livestock-feed demand rose,
according to data from Shanghai JC Intelligence Co.  “Soybeans would have to rise to more than $14 to cut
profit margins back to breakeven,” Buckner said.  Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $31.8
billion last year, government figures show. The country’s corn
crop was worth $48.6 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
