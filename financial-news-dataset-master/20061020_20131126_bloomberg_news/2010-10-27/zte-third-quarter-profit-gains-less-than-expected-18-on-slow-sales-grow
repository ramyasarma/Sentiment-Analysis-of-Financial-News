  ZTE Corp. , China’s second-biggest
maker of telephone equipment, posted a smaller-than-expected 18
percent gain in third-quarter profit as sales increased less
than estimated.  Net income  rose to 483.9 million yuan ($72.4 million), or
0.17 yuan a share, from 408.6 million yuan, or 0.15 yuan, a year
earlier,  ZTE said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing
yesterday. Projected profit was 525 million yuan, according to
the median estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Sales gained to 15.3 billion yuan from 15.1 billion yuan.
The median estimate was for 17.4 billion yuan. ZTE said non-
operating income rose to 470.2 million yuan from 262.8 million.  ZTE and bigger Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co. are
offering lower prices than overseas vendors including Ericsson
AB to expand overseas sales as they look to expand beyond China,
the world’s biggest phone market by users. ZTE won contracts in
the third quarter to supply network equipment in markets
including Hungary, Taiwan and Turkey, and agreed to sell
handsets in the U.S. through Verizon Wireless.  ZTE’s  shares  fell 3.8 percent to HK$31.50 in Hong Kong
yesterday, before the earnings release. The stock dropped 5.1
percent in Shenzhen trading to 28.13 yuan.  ZTE’s push for overseas sales has drawn concern in
countries including the U.S. and India.  Four U.S. lawmakers asked the Federal Communications
Commission this month to review the security risks of ordering
network equipment from Huawei and ZTE. ZTE, in a statement,
called that letter “anti-competitive, protectionist and
somewhat xenophobic.”  India established a new import system for telecom equipment
from China in August on concerns similar to those in the U.S.  -- Edmond Lococo . Editor:  Josh Fellman   To contact the reporter on this story:
