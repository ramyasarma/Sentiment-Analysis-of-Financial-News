The French government’s planned
overhaul will bring the country’s pension funding back into
balance until at least 2020, La Tribune reported, citing an
interview with Labor Minister Eric Woerth.  Woerth “obviously wants to continue to participate in the
government’s reforms” once the pensions bill is passed,
according to the French daily newspaper.  He refuted claims that controversy over his alleged links
with L’Oreal SA heiress Liliane Bettencourt had helped fuel
opposition to the government’s pension plan.  “It’s the retirement question that’s mobilising and
creating these protest marches,” he said, according to La
Tribune.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
