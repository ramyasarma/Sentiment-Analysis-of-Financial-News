The Australian stock exchange has
resolved a problem related to futures trading, ASX Ltd.
spokesman Matthew Gibbs said by telephone.  “The issue with the futures has been resolved and the
system’s been reconnected,” Gibbs said, adding that normal  trading of core futures products will resume at 1:10 p.m. in
Sydney.  Trading was halted about a 90 seconds after a statistic
bureau announcement on consumer prices at 11:30 a.m., Gibbs  said earlier, citing a problem encountered with the matching of  trades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
