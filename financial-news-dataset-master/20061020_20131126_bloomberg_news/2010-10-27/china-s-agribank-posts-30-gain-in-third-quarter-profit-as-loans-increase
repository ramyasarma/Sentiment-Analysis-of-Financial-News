Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. 
reported a 30 percent gain in third-quarter profit, beating
analysts’ estimates, in its first results since completing the
world’s biggest initial public offering in August.  Net income climbed to 24.3 billion yuan ($3.6 billion), or
0.08 yuan a share, from 18.77 billion yuan, or 0.07 a share, a
year earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a statement to
the Shanghai stock exchange today. That exceeded the 22 billion
yuan median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Agricultural Bank, China’s largest lender to farmers,
benefited from bigger loan spreads as it pays less on deposits
and charges more for loans in rural areas than in cities. The
third-quarter earnings, the bank’s first as a public company
after raising $22.1 billion, took it to within 15 percent of
reaching a full-year profit target of at least 82.9 billion yuan.  “The cheap rural deposit base, low loan-to-deposit ratio
and the potentially improving operational efficiency of its
rural network should bolster the company’s profitability,”
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analysts  Irene Huang  and
 Desmond Cheung  wrote in an Oct. 22 note. They have a “hold”
rating on the stock.  More than half of Agricultural Bank’s almost 24,000 outlets
are in less developed rural areas, which contributed about a
quarter of its overall pretax profit. Its cost-to-income ratio
dropped to 36.9 percent in the first nine months, down 2.14
percentage points from the same period a year earlier.  Agricultural Bank  shares fell 0.3 percent to HK$4.05 in
Hong Kong before today’s earnings announcement. In Shanghai, the
 shares  have advanced 3 percent from the IPO price.  The lender is the last major Chinese bank to sell shares to
the public, wrapping up a decade-long overhaul of the nation’s
 banking industry  that cost the government an estimated $650
billion in bailouts and restructuring programs.  The bank had 4.77 trillion yuan of loans outstanding by the
end of September, an increase of 13.9 percent from the end of
last year, it said today. Non-performing loans accounted for
2.08 percent of total advances as of Sept. 30, the highest among
the nation’s 16 publicly traded banks.  Agricultural Bank set aside 12.9 billion yuan to cover
potential bad loans in the third quarter, boosting its coverage
ratio to 159.7 percent, higher than the minimum 150 percent
required by the nation’s banking regulator.  During the past month, China announced its first  rate
increase  since 2007, boosting reserve-requirement ratios for the
largest banks for the fourth time this year and allowing gains
in the yuan to accelerate in a bid to prevent asset bubbles as
funds pour into the nation.  Agricultural Bank’s net interest income rose 42 percent to
62.3 billion yuan, while income from fee-based services gained
35 percent to 11.57 billion yuan. Net interest margin widened,
the bank said, without giving more details.  Set up in 1951 by  Mao Zedong  to finance rural cooperatives,
Agricultural Bank was the first Chinese commercial lender
established during Communist rule. The lender had 320 million
customers and 23,560 outlets at the end of June in China, more
than any other Chinese bank.  -- Luo Jun . Editors:  Chitra Somayaji ,  James Gunsalus   To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
