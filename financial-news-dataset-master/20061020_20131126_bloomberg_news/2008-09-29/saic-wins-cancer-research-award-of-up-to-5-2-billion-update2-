             SAIC Inc. (SAI) , the San Diego-based
defense contractor specializing in computer services, won a
contract valued at as much as $5.2 billion to provide
support to the  National Cancer Institute's  research center
in Frederick,  Maryland .  
 The contract is the largest single research award ever
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, SAIC
said today in a statement. The Federally Funded Research
and Development Center is the only one of 38 national
laboratories in the U.S. focused exclusively on cancer and
HIV/AIDS research, the company said.  
 SAIC, which has worked with the Maryland center since
1995, will provide operations and technical support in basic,
translational and preclinical research under the new contract.
The award has a three-year base period, five one-year options
and one two-year option. Under its current contract, SAIC
supports more than 300 clinical trials and operates two
facilities that produce drugs and vaccines for the trials.  
 SAIC fell 71 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $19.39 at 4
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have fallen 3.6 percent this year.
