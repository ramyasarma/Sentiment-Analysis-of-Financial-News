             (Corrects spelling of finance director's name in fourth
paragraph.)  
 Grafton Group Plc (GFTU) , Ireland's biggest
builders' merchant, said analyst estimates for 2008 are
``reasonable,'' given levels of spending on home improvements in
its domestic market.  
 Estimates for earnings per share this year range from 73
cents to 76 cents, the Dublin-based company said today. Earnings
per share for 2007 will ``be in line with or a little below''
analysts' estimates for 86 cents.  
 The U.K. offers ``sound'' prospects for growth, while
housing starts may rise in Ireland even as completions decline
from 2007, the company said. Planning permissions in Grafton's
home market are increasing, which may underpin demand for home
improvements, the company said.  
 ``We will produce operating profits and pretax profits of
somewhere around 170 million euros'' in 2008, Colm O'Nuallain,
finance director at Grafton, said in an interview on Bloomberg
television. ``So we are still making a lot of money.''  
 Grafton shares rose as much as 29 cents, or 5.6 percent, to
5.55 euros, and traded at 5.50 euros as of 4:30 p.m. local time.
The stock lost 57 percent of its value during 2007 on concern
about a slowdown in the Irish housing market.  
  Abbey Plc (ABBY) , Ireland's second-biggest publicly traded
homebuilder, said on Dec. 7 that cooling markets may result in a
``very poor'' performance over the next two years.  
 Irish housing completions may fall as much as 40 percent to
45,000, Grafton said, though construction outside homebuilding
may be ``positive'' this year. Grafton supplies dry mortar and
other building materials to contractors.  
 ``They've managed to calm a few nerves,'' said Kevin McConnell, head of research at Bloxham Stockbrokers in Dublin.
``The management's tone was reasonably positive, and that helped
in the face of negative sentiment about the Irish economy.''  
 Ireland's government has said it may borrow to help fund a
seven-year, 184 billion-euro plan to improve the country's
roads, railways and phone lines as the economy slows.  
 The investment program, known as the National Development
Plan 2007-2013, amounts to about 16 percent of Ireland's gross
domestic product.
