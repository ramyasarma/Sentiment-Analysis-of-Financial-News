             Contact Energy Ltd., New Zealand’s
biggest publicly traded power company, said generation increased
6 percent in March as low rainfall on the North Island boosted
demand for electricity from its gas-fired plants.  
 Contact produced 739 gigawatt-hours of power last month,
compared with 697 gigawatt-hours a year earlier, the Wellington-
based company said in a statement today. The utility earned an
average NZ$112.09 per megawatt-hour, from NZ$35.56 a year
earlier, when high lake levels depressed prices.  
 Contact, half-owned by Sydney-based Origin Energy Ltd., is
reviewing strategy as new fuel contracts reduce the flexibility
of its gas-fired plants and competition constrains retail price
increases. Total generation the past nine months is down 2.1
percent from a year earlier, led by a 12 percent slump in
output from the gas turbines.  
 Still, a shortage of water in the Waikato hydro dams run by
rival Mighty River Power Ltd. increased demand from other
generators and lifted prices nationwide the past two months.  
 Generation from Contact’s two largest thermal plants
climbed 43 percent to 344 gigawatt-hours last month, it said in
the statement to the New Zealand stock exchange, even as the
company shut its 377-megawatt unit at Stratford late in the
period for maintenance.  
 Output from the company’s two South Island dams fell to 212
gigawatt-hours, 19 percent less than a year earlier, while
geothermal production was down about 6 percent.  
 For the past nine months, Contact’s generation prices
averaged NZ$51.70 a megawatt-hour, compared with NZ$60.15 a year
earlier. Retail power sales fell 2 percent to 5,626 gigawatt-
hours, and gas use for generation dropped 13 percent to 22
petajoules.
