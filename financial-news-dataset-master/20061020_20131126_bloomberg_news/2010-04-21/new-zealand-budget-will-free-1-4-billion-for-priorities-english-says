             New Zealand’s budget will include
another NZ$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion) for priority spending,
Finance Minister Bill English said today in a statement on the
government’s Web site.  
 A spokesman for English declined to comment on the
statement, which was removed from the Web site almost
immediately. English is scheduled to speak in Wellington at 1
p.m. local time today.  
 New Zealand’s budget showed a cash deficit for the first
time in nine years in the 12 months ended June 30, and English
has projected six years of shortfalls as debt increases. The
government is reviewing some welfare payments, merging several
state agencies and curbing spending on various services to get
the deficit under control.  
 Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund said
the government should make deeper spending cuts to eliminate its
deficit sooner. English delivers the budget on May 20.
