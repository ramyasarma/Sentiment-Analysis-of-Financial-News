             Mexico’s peso rose for a third
consecutive day after the International Monetary Fund raised its
forecast for the nation’s economy in 2010.  
 The currency increased 0.4 percent to 12.1776 per U.S.
dollar at 5 p.m. New York time, from 12.2212 yesterday. The peso
has risen 7.5 percent this year, the best performer against the
U.S. dollar of the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “There continues to be a flow of economic metrics and
developments that point in the direction of an improved panorama
and an improved landscape overall for the Mexican economy
ahead,” said Enrique Alvarez, head of research for Latin
America at IDEAGlobal in New York.  
 Mexico’s economy may grow 4.2 percent this year, the IMF
said today in a report as it raised its forecast for the region.  
 The report said Latin America is experiencing a strong and
balanced recovery from last year’s downturn. Mexico’s economy
contracted 6.5 percent in 2009.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.718 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the securities
rose 0.77 centavo to 119.93 centavos per peso.  
 Traders triggered $5 million in dollar options today,
exhausting all $600 million in options the central bank offered
this month. The bank has been auctioning the options monthly to
boost foreign reserves after the peso fell to a record low last
year.  
 “We are still waiting for the currency commission to come
in and tweak” the option program, said Flavia Cattan-Naslausky,
currency strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford,
Connecticut. “That is on the back of everyone’s minds.”  
 Traders exercised 99 percent of the $600 million in dollar
options the central bank auctioned for April as of yesterday.
The bank has been buying dollars from traders to boost foreign
reserves after the peso reached a record low last year.
