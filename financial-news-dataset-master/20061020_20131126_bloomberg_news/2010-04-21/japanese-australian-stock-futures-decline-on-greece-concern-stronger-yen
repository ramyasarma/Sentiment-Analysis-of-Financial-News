             Japanese and Australian stock
futures fell on concern Greece will default on its debt, and as
the yen strengthened against the euro.  
 American depositary receipts of Nissan Motor Co., a
carmaker that gets 77 percent of its revenue outside Japan,
closed 0.6 percent lower than the Tokyo close yesterday.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest
lender by market value, fell 1.5 percent after the stock jumped
the most in two weeks yesterday. ADRs of BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s biggest mining company, dropped 1 percent after oil fell
in New York and metal prices in London slipped.  
 Yen-denominated futures expiring in June on Japan’s Nikkei
225 Stock Average closed at 11,025 in Chicago yesterday, 0.7
percent less than 11,105 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-
market at 11,020 as of 8:04 a.m. today in Osaka, Japan. The
Nikkei 225 closed at 11,090.05 yesterday after its biggest gain
since March 8.  
 “The prolonged concern about Greece’s debt is a
headwind,” said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees the equivalent
of $450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “Yesterday’s gain was surprisingly big, so
investors will likely sell stocks to lock in profits.”  
 Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.7 percent
today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped 0.1 percent.  
 U.S., Greece Risk  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent.
The index dropped 0.1 percent in New York yesterday, as the
International Monetary Fund called Greece’s fiscal crisis a
“wake-up call” on sovereign-debt risks. The yield on Greece’s
benchmark 10-year bond surpassed 8 percent, the highest in more
than a decade.  
 Gilead Sciences Inc. and Abbott Laboratories led drug
companies lower in the index after saying new health-care laws
will hurt sales.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has risen 5.6 percent this year,
compared with increases of 8.1 percent for the S&P 500 and 5.6
percent for the Dow Jones Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Companies in
the Asian gauge trade at 16.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 15.3 times for the S&P 500 and 13.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  
 The yen strengthened to as much as 124.28 against the euro
yesterday after Tokyo stock trading closed, from 125.24 at the 3
p.m. close. That reduces the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  
 The London Metal Exchange Index of six industrial metals,
including copper and zinc, fell 0.8 percent yesterday, its third
decline in four days. Crude oil slid 0.2 percent yesterday in
New York.  
 Singapore Airlines Ltd., the world’s second-biggest carrier
by market value, said it had lost potential revenue of about
S$40 million ($29 million) from flight cancellations and
disruptions in Europe caused by Iceland’s volcanic ash cloud.
