             Financial assistance to companies
affected by Australia’s proposed emissions trading plan would be
a waste of A$20 billion, the Australian Financial Review said,
citing a report by the Grattan Institute. Australia’s steel and
cement industries are the only sectors that should be entitled
to financial assistance, the newspaper said, citing the
institute’s Chief Executive Officer John Daley.
