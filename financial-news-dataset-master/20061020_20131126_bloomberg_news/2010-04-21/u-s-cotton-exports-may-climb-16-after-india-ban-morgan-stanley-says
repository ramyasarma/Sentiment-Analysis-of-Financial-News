             U.S. cotton exports may rise as
much as 16 percent from the government’s estimate for the year
ending July 31 after India halted overseas sales this week,
according to Morgan Stanley analyst Hussein Allidina.  
 U.S. shipments may reach 13.97 million bales to cover the
supply gap caused by India’s ban, Allidina said today in a
report. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on April 9 forecast
exports of 12 million bales. India is the biggest grower of
cotton after China.  
 Registration of export contracts were suspended from April
19 until “further orders,” India’s textile commissioner said
yesterday. The nation exported 4.69 million bales as of April 15
from a registration of 6.67 million bales, according to the
Morgan Stanley report.  
 “Historically, both U.S. and Indian exports to China have
increased seasonally into the end of the marketing year,”
Allidina said. “With India out of the market until further
notice, we see upside potential to U.S. cotton exports.”  
 China is the world’s biggest consumer of cotton. A bale
weighs 480 pounds (218 kilograms).
