             Manchester United tops Forbes
magazine’s list of the most valuable soccer clubs for the sixth
straight year with an estimated market value of $1.8 billion.  
 The 18-time English champion, controlled by the Florida-
based Glazer family, is followed by record nine-time European
Cup winner Real Madrid, with a value $1.3 billion. London-based
Arsenal, the subject of takeover speculation, completes the top
three with a $1.2 billion valuation.  
 Forbes determined the value using previous sales, broadcast
agreements and debt from stadium construction. Real was ranked
as soccer’s richest team by revenue in a review published by
accountant Deloitte last month. United was third, behind
European champion Barcelona.  
 The top five clubs claimed 86 percent of the $5.5 billion
revenue of European soccer’s top 20 clubs for the 2008-09 season
“because their worldwide following allows them to grab much
more sponsorship and media revenue,” Forbes said yesterday in a
statement.  
 The magazine valued Barcelona at $1 billion, ranking it
fourth, ahead of Germany’s Bayern Munich, which it said was
worth $990 million.  
 “Due to Barcelona’s decision to sell broadcast rights
individually, this team has become so wealthy that it doesn’t
even need a shirt sponsor,” Forbes said of the Spanish champion,
which won a record six trophies last season.
     Liverpool, the five-time European champion put up for sale
by its American co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks last week,
is worth $822 million, according to Forbes.  
 “Despite the large amount of debt most clubs accrue,
investors are continuing to pick up teams around the globe, due
in large part to soccer’s growth prospects in emerging
markets,” Forbes said. Liverpool and Manchester United owe more
than $1 billion collectively.
