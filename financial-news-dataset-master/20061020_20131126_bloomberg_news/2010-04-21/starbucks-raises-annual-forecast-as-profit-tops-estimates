             Starbucks Corp., the world’s
largest coffee-shop operator, raised its annual forecast after
reporting second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates,
helped by sales of Via instant coffee and more customer visits.  
 Earnings for the year will be as much as $1.22 a share,
excluding some charges, the company said today in a statement,
compared with its previous forecast for profit of as much as
$1.08. Analysts on average expect $1.12, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The Seattle-based coffee chain’s sales are growing as
consumers begin to feel better about spending money, according
to Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead. Consumers in the U.S.
gained confidence in March as the gloom over job prospects began
to lift.  
 “We’re benefiting from a consumer who’s feeling just a
little bit better,” Alstead said in a telephone interview after
the earnings were announced. Starbucks’s improved customer
satisfaction scores and its new loyalty program have also
increased sales, Alstead said.  
 The Conference Board’s index of U.S. consumer confidence
rose to 52.5 in March, exceeding the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, from 46.4 in February.  
 “As consumer confidence comes back, you automatically pick
up some sales,” Bill Smead, chief investment officer of the
Smead Value Fund, said in an interview after the results were
announced.  
 Sales of Via, as well as distribution agreements with
sandwich-shop chain Subway and Burger King Holdings Inc., will
increase profits further, said Smead, whose Seattle-based fund
owned 63,890 shares of Starbucks as of Dec. 31.  
 Via, Frappuccinos  
 Starbucks plans to increase advertising for its Via instant
coffee and its frappuccinos in the third quarter, spending 2
percent to 3 percent of its sales in the period on ads, Alstead
said. That will increase its annual advertising costs to as much
as 2 percent of sales from its usual 1 percent, Alstead said.  
 Net income rose to $217.3 million, or 28 cents a share, in
the second quarter that ended March 28, compared with $25
million, or 3 cents, a year ago, Starbucks said in the
statement. Profit excluding some items was 29 cents, beating by
4 cents the average of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Revenue climbed 8.6 percent to $2.53 billion, compared with
an average analyst estimate of $2.41 billion.  
 Sales at stores open at least a year advanced 7 percent in
the U.S., driven by a 3 percent increase in the number of
customer visits and a 5 percent jump in the amount of the
average sale. Comparable-store sales rose 7 percent worldwide.
