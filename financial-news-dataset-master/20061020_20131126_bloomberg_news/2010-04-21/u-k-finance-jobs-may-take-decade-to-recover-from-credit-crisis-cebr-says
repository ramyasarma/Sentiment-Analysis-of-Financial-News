             Employment in London’s financial
services industry may not return to its pre-credit crisis level
for at least 11 years as taxes and regulation become
increasingly onerous, the Centre for Economics & Business
Research Ltd. said.  
 The number of jobs in the London’s financial districts,
centered around the City and Canary Wharf, will climb to about
329,000 in 2012 from 319,000 in 2010, the research firm said.
The total won’t return to the 354,000 employed in 2007 until
2021, the CEBR said.  
 Politicians, forced to bail out their nations’ banks, are
turning on the industry worldwide. The International Monetary
Fund this week called on the Group of 20 leaders to tax banks to
help pay for future rescues. The plan could cut pretax profit at
Europe’s lenders by as much as 20 percent, Credit Suisse Group
AG analysts said yesterday. In December, the U.K. put a one-time
50 percent levy on bankers’ discretionary bonuses.  
 “Both the tax and regulation policy for the City are now
up in the air,” Benjamin Williamson, one of the CEBR report’s
authors, said in a statement. “There has been a move towards
international agreements with respect to tax and regulation of
the financial service industry. The problem is that some of the
people behind such agreements will not necessarily have an
economic interest in a healthy City of London.”  
 The CEBR said firms may add 14,000 jobs in 2010, compared
with its October estimate of 9,000, as earnings rebound from the
credit crisis.  
 Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs  
 “Large first-quarter profits announcements are expected
over the coming weeks as institutions have taken advantage of
record low interest rates and the fewer number of players in
financial markets,” the CEBR said.  
 Morgan Stanley, which has its European headquarters in
London, yesterday posted earnings that beat analysts’ estimates
as fixed-income trading revenue more than doubled from a year
earlier. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which has its office on
London’s Fleet Street, said April 20 that net income almost
doubled in the first quarter.  
 Some London banks have started hiring bankers to replace
employees they cut during the credit crisis. Lloyds Banking
Group Plc, the lender 41 percent-owned by the U.K. government,
plans to employ more sales and trading staff. Barclays Plc, the
U.K.’s second largest bank, has also been adding mergers bankers
at its securities unit as the pace of takeovers increases.
