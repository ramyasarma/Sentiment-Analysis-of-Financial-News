             Amgen Inc., the world’s largest
biotechnology company, said first-quarter profit climbed 15
percent as it boosted sales and prices on its drugs. Revenue for
2010 will be at the low end of previous forecasts due to costs
of the U.S. health-care overhaul, the company said.  
 Net income rose to $1.17 billion, or $1.18 a share, from
$1.02 billion, or 98 cents, a year earlier, Thousand Oaks,
California-based Amgen said today in a statement. Earnings,
excluding certain items, were $1.30, beating the $1.24 average
estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Shares fell in
extended trading.  
 Revenue rose 8.6 percent to $3.59 billion from $3.31
billion a year ago. Amgen was helped by first-quarter price
increases of 1 percent to 5 percent on six drugs, said Eric
Schmidt, a Cowen & Co. analyst based in New York. While the
company is poised for growth, investors appear to be waiting for
the release of reports on whether its experimental bone drug
denosumab prevents prostate cancer from spreading to bone,
Schmidt said.  
 “They had a pretty good quarter but nobody seems to
care,” Schmidt said today in a telephone interview. “The base
business is chugging along but the real focus is on denosumab. I
think a lot of people are waiting until those data come out in
the second half of the year.”  
 Amgen fell 23 cents, less than 1 percent, to $58.48 at 5:55
p.m. New York time in extended trading on the Nasdaq Stock
Exchange following the earnings announcement, after declining
2.4 percent to $58.71 at the close.  
 Denosumab Review  
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is scheduled to
complete a review by July 25 of Amgen’s application to market
denosumab for older women with osteoporosis, Amgen said on Feb.
19. Eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg project denosumab
revenue to reach $176 million this year and $990 million in
2011.  
 “We view denosumab’s profile in oncology as superior in
all respects” to Novartis AG’s Zometa, Schmidt said in a report
to investors on April 12. Zometa had sales last year of $1.5
billion for the Swiss drugmaker. “Should denosumab succeed in
preventing the formation of new metastases in patients with
prostate cancer, we believe upside could be much more
substantial.”  
 Amgen said 2010 revenue would be on the low end of the
forecast of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion estimated last
quarter. That’s less than the $15.3 billion average estimate by
17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Overhaul Law Impact  
 Provisions of the U.S. health-care overhaul law, including
one that increases fees paid by drugmakers, cost Amgen $33
million in the first quarter and will increase costs by
$200 million to $250 million this year, said George Morrow, the
company’s executive vice president for global operations, in a
conference call with analysts. The company won’t benefit from
greater numbers of Americans being covered by health insurance
until 2014, he said.  
 Combined sales of Neulasta and Neupogen, which boost
infection-fighting white blood cells in patients undergoing
chemotherapy, rose 10 percent to $1.18 billion. Amgen raised the
prices on the drugs 2.9 percent on Jan. 21, according to
Schmidt.  
 Sales of Enbrel, the arthritis and psoriasis drug that
makes up almost a quarter of the company’s revenue, rose 6
percent to $804 million. Amgen raised Enbrel’s price 4.9 percent
on March 5, Schmidt said.  
 Combined sales of the company’s two anemia drugs, Aranesp
and Epogen, rose 5 percent to $1.25 billion.
