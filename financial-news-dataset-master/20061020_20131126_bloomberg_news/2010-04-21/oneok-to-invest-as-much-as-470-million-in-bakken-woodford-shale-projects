             Oneok Partners LP, a unit of
natural-gas distributer and energy trader Oneok Inc., said it
will spend about $405 million to $470 million on projects in the
Bakken Shale in North Dakota and the Woodford Shale in Oklahoma
to meet increasing producer demand.  
 The investments include construction of a 100-million-
cubic-feet-a-day gas-processing facility in eastern McKenzie
County, North Dakota, and related expansions that will cost $150
million to $210 million, the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company said
today in a statement. The plant is expected to be completed in
the fourth quarter of 2011, Oneok said.  
 Other plans include gas-gathering-system expansions in the
Bakken and Woodford shales, the company said. The investments
are part of a previously announced $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion
plan for project investments expected between now and the end of
2015, Oneok said.  
 The announcement was made after the close of regular U.S.
trading. Oneok rose 7 cents to $48.63 at 4:17 p.m. in after-
hours trading.
