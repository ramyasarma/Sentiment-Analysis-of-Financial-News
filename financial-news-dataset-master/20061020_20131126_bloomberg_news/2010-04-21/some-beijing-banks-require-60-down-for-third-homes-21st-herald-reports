             Some banks in Beijing are requiring
down payments equal to 60 percent of a property’s value for 
loans to buy third homes, the 21st Century Business Herald 
reported today, citing an unidentified Agricultural Bank of 
China official.  
 A portion of banks in the Chinese capital are also imposing
interest rates that are 20 percent higher than the benchmark 
rate for third-home mortgages, the Guangzhou-based newspaper 
reported on its Web site late yesterday.  
 Bank of China Ltd. has increased its down payment and 
interest rate requirements for third-home mortgages, the 
newspaper reported, citing Vice President Zhang Yanling.
