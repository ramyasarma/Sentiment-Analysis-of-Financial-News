             The euro traded near a two-week
low against the dollar on concern discussions of a 45 billion-
euro ($60 billion) aid package for Greece will fail to stem the
nation’s debt crisis.  
 The 16-nation currency fell against the yen for a second
day as the International Monetary Fund yesterday cautioned that
a failure of nations to contain soaring public debt might have
“severe” consequences for the world economy. The yen may
advance against higher-yielding currencies on expectations U.S.
President Barack Obama will say today that new financial-
industry regulations are needed.  
 “I don’t see positives coming out of the Greece
situation,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, manager of foreign-exchange
margin trading at Ueda Harlow Ltd. in Tokyo. “The issue is
deep, and negotiations among nations are also complicating the
matter. The euro is poised to continue to fall gradually.”  
 The euro was at $1.3389 as of 8:03 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.3390 in New York yesterday, when it touched $1.3359, the
lowest since April 9. Europe’s currency fetched 124.56 yen from
124.77 yen. The yen was at 93.03 per dollar from 93.19.  
 The yield premium investors demand to hold Greek 10-year
bonds instead of benchmark German bunds climbed to 5.01
percentage points, the highest level since at least March 1998.  
 Talks started yesterday on an assistance package including
30 billion euros from the European Union and as much as 15
billion euros from the IMF. Greece Finance Minister George
Papaconstantinou said the nation may request aid before talks
on the conditions for the loans conclude in two weeks.  
 Greece’s deficit of 12.9 percent of gross domestic product
is four times the EU limit. Budget shortfalls across the euro
region have surged as governments bailed out banks and spent
billions on economic stimulus.
