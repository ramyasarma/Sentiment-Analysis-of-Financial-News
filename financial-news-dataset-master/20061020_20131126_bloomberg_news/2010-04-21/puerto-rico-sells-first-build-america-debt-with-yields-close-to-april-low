             Puerto Rico Electric Power
Authority increased its debt sale by 67 percent to about $963
million of tax-exempt and Build America bonds and lowered its
borrowing costs in an issue today.  
 PREPA had planned to sell $575 million in debt. It more
than doubled the tax-exempt refunding bonds to about $643
million after investor bids exceeded the amount of securities
offered in some maturities, said John Flahive, director of fixed
income for BNY Mellon Wealth Management in Boston. The Build
America portion rose to $320 million from $300 million, said
David Desevilla, assistant vice president at Santander
Securities, lead underwriter on the taxable segment.  
 Flahive, who helps manage $22 billion in municipal
holdings, said he purchased some of the bonds and that he’s been
a “buyer and holder of Puerto Rico debt for years.”  
 Average yields on Build America debt fell to 6.13 percent
yesterday, the lowest since March 17, according to the Wells
Fargo Build America Bond Index. Top-rated, 10-year tax-exempts
yielded 3.21 percent, the lowest since March 29, a daily survey
by Muncipal Market Advisors shows. Yields on PREPA’s 15-year
tax-exempts were 4.67 percent, 9 basis points less than on the
same maturity in a prior issue March 26, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.

 The authority, a monopoly that provides electricity for 1.4
million customers, is rated BBB+ by Fitch Ratings, its third-
lowest investment grade.  
 PREPA offered tax-exempts in serial maturities from 1 to 18
years. Bonds due in 2026, the largest portion at $85 million,
were 9 basis points below the previous sale at 4.75 percent.
Bonds maturing in 2027 and 2028 were only offered with a 2015
optional call -- a defensive move for PREPA against potential
interest-rate increases, said Michael Walls, manager of the $538
million Waddell & Reed Advisors Municipal High Income Fund in
Shawnee Mission, Kansas.  
 The Build Americas, which will fund capital projects,
according to preliminary offering documents, are the first such
issue for the island. Preliminary pricing on the bonds, which
mature in 2040, was for a yield of about 151 basis points above
comparable-maturity Treasuries, Desevilla said. The 30-year
Treasury  yielded about 4.62 percent today.  
 Bonds of Puerto Rico, a self-governing commonwealth ceded
to the U.S. in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, offer
investors an exemption from any state tax, unlike most municipal
debt. The U.S. Treasury pays issuers of Build America Bonds,
which are subject to federal income tax, a 35 percent subsidy on
interest costs.  
 “This was the right time to go to market and take
advantage” of the Build America Bond program, said Fernando
Batlle, vice president of finance for the Government Development
Bank, Puerto Rico’s fiscal manager, in an interview yesterday.
He wasn’t immediately available for comment today.
