             PCCW Ltd. plans to raise HK$16
billion in a syndicated loan to repay higher-interest debt 
maturing next year, Hong Kong’s Ming Pao Daily News reported 
today.  
 PCCW will pay the Hong Kong Interbank Offered
Rate plus 100 basis points, or one percentage point, on the new
loan, a saving of 0.8 percentage point over the debt it’s
repaying, the paper quoted unidentified bankers as saying. This
is the first syndicated loan fund raising by PCCW after its
failed privatization last year, Ming Pao said.
