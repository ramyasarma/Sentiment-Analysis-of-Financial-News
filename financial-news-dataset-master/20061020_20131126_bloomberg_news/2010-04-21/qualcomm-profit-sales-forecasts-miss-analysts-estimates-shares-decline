             Qualcomm Inc., the biggest maker of
chips that run mobile phones, forecast sales and earnings that
fell short of analysts’ predictions, signaling consumers may be
opting for handsets that are less profitable for the company.  
 Qualcomm fell as much as 8.5 percent in late trading after
projecting profit of 40 cents to 44 cents a share for this
quarter. Analysts predicted 44 cents, according to the average
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Most of Qualcomm’s profit comes from technology licenses
tied to mobile-phone prices, which are under pressure as demand
rises faster in regions where phones sell for less, said Mark
McKechnie, a Broadpoint Amtech Inc. analyst in San Francisco.
Growth may also be constrained as consumers choose Apple Inc.’s
iPhone instead of devices made by Qualcomm customers.  
 “The U.S., Europe and Japan are still depressed and these
are the higher average-selling-price regions,” said McKechnie,
who recommends buying the shares and said he doesn’t own any.
“The hope is that the higher price markets will come back, but
from this report it doesn’t look like they’re seeing signs of
that.”  
 Qualcomm fell as much as $3.64 to $38.99 in late trading,
after closing at $42.63 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock
has lost 7.9 percent this year.  
 The company’s customers include Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung Electronics Co. and Seoul-based LG Electronics Inc., two
of the top three mobile-phone makers.  
 Falling Prices  
 Apple reported this week that iPhone sales more than
doubled to $5.45 billion and accounted for 40 percent of the
company’s revenue last quarter. The iPhone’s chip suppliers
include Samsung, Marvell Technology Group Ltd. and Infineon
Technologies AG.  
 Global unit sales of smartphones, such as the iPhone, may
jump 46 percent this year, compared with growth of as little as
11 percent for the total mobile-phone market, Stamford,
Connecticut-based research firm Gartner Inc. predicted Feb. 23.  
 Sales this quarter will be $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion,
Qualcomm said in a statement today. Analysts had projected $2.66
billion on average.  
 The average price of a phone using Qualcomm’s technology
will probably drop to about $185 this year, according to the
midpoint of the company’s forecast. Qualcomm lowered the
midpoint from $187.  
 Second-Quarter Results  
 Net income was $774 million, or 46 cents a share, in the
three months ended March 28. That compares with a loss of $289
million, or 18 cents, a year earlier, when the company paid to
settle a patent case with Broadcom Corp. Sales last quarter rose
to $2.66 billion.  
 Analysts had predicted profit of 46 cents a share on sales
of $2.63 billion. Qualcomm had raised its forecasts for the
second quarter on March 25, citing stronger-than-expected
licensing and sales.  
 The company gets the majority of its revenue from supplying
chips to phone makers. Most of its profit comes from license
fees paid by makers of phones, phone equipment and
semiconductors, which use Qualcomm’s code division multiple
access technology.
