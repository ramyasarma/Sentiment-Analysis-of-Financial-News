             Investors should sell the euro
against the British pound as the U.K. recovers faster than
anticipated, prompting the central bank to raise interest rates
earlier than debt markets are indicating, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. analysts said today in a note to clients.   
 Goldman recommended investors sell euros, targeting a drop
to 83 pence, with an order to exit the trade if the currency
closes above 88.50 pence. The euro traded at 86.875 pence as of
7:47 a.m. in Tokyo from 86.893 yesterday in New York.
