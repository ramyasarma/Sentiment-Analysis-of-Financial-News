             Chinese banks will designate which 
loans are mortgages for second homes based on property 
ownership by an individual’s immediate family, the Shanghai 
Securities News reported, citing Yang Jiacai, head of the China
Banking Regulatory Commission’s Banking Supervision Department 
I.  
 Banks had in the past designated second home loans based on
the lending history of the individual applying for the 
mortgage, the Shanghai-based newspaper reported.  
 Checks on property ownership will be done for the husband, 
wife and children of a family, according to the report.
