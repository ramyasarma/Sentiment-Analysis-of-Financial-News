             The Bank of Japan may raise its
economic growth forecast for fiscal 2011 at a policy meeting to
be held April 30, the Asahi newspaper reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  
 The central bank will probably maintain its current money
stance and decide not to provide further liquidity in the
market. The BOJ may also forecast a faster increase in prices,
the report said.
