             AngloGold Ashanti Holdings Plc, the
South African metals producer, sold $1 billion of notes
in a two-part offering, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 AngloGold Ashanti sold $700 million of 10-year notes
that yield 165 basis points more than similar-maturity
U.S. Treasuries and $300 million of 30-year debt that pays a
200 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  
 The company previously marketed $750 million of the debt,
according to a person familiar with the transaction, who
declined to be identified because the marketing was private.
