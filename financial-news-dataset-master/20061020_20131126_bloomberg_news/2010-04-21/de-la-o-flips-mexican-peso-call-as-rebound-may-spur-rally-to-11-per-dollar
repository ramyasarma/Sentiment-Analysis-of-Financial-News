             Rogelio Ramirez de la O, the
Mexican economist who predicted the 1994 peso devaluation, said
the currency will rally through the end of 2010, the second time
in as many years that he has abandoned a forecast for a decline.  
 The peso will strengthen to as much as 11 per U.S. dollar,
an 11 percent gain from today’s level, before finishing the year
between 12 pesos and 12.2 pesos, Ramirez, the sole partner at
research firm Ecanal, said in an interview in Mexico City today.  
 Investors are buying the Mexican peso to take advantage of
the carry trade, borrowing in nations with low interest rates to
purchase higher-yielding assets, Ramirez, 61, said. Mexico’s 4.5
percent benchmark interest rate is higher than near zero rates
in the U.S., 1 percent in the euro-zone and 0.1 percent in
Japan. The peso has risen 7.5 percent this year, the best
performance among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “Financial markets are being inundated with liquidity
right now, and investors are buying any instrument they can get
their hands on,” Ramirez said. “Mexico has become a target for
the carry trade.”  
 Ramirez said in January that the currency would weaken to
15 pesos per dollar by the end of the year as the recovery in
the U.S., the biggest buyer of Mexico’s exports, falters and
central banks remove stimulus.  
 In March 2009, Ramirez predicted the peso would strengthen
to beyond 13 per dollar by year-end from 14.1722 after President
Felipe Calderon said he was seeking a credit line with the
International Monetary Fund. Earlier that month he had predicted
it would weaken to 18.2. The currency ended the year at 13.0914
per dollar.  
 The currency rose 0.3 percent to 12.1790 per U.S. dollar at
5 p.m. New York time today from 12.2212 yesterday.  
 Ramirez, who earned his PhD in economics at Cambridge
University, was the chief economic advisor for 2006 presidential
candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
