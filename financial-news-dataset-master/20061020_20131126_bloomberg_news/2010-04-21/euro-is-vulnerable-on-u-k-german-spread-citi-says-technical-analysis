             The euro may fall to its lowest
level in more than a year versus the pound on the biggest yield
advantage of U.K. government debt over German securities in more
than 17 months, according to Citigroup Inc.  
 The yield spread between U.K. and German two-year
government bonds widened yesterday past 0.30 percentage point.
That technical level was breached in favor of German yields in
November 2008, pushing the euro to a record high against the
pound the following month.  
 “This was a key pivot towards the end of 2008,” Citigroup
Inc. technical analysts including Tom Fitzpatrick in New York
and Shyam Devani in London wrote in a note to clients yesterday.
“We suspect the opposite may be seen in the near future. Euro-
sterling is vulnerable.”  
 The euro may fall to 84 pence, a level last seen in
December 2008, if it breaks support in a range of 86.75 to 87
pence, according to Citigroup. Support is an area where buy
orders may cluster.  
 The 16-nation currency fell 0.6 percent to 86.94 pence
yesterday, from 87.47 on April 20. The euro has dropped 1.8
percent against the pound this year.  
 The Bank of England will raise its 0.50 percent main
interest rate by a quarter-percentage point by the fourth
quarter of 2010, according to the weighted average of 50
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The European Central Bank
won’t follow suit with its 1 percent target rate until the first
quarter of 2011, according to a separate survey.  
 Greek officials joined counterparts from the euro region,
the International Monetary and the ECB to discuss deficit-
cutting measures that Greece will have to accept to be able to
tap a 45 billion euro ($61 billion) aid package.  
 The yield on two-year U.K. government debt increased to
1.20 percent, from 1.16 percent yesterday. The yield on
comparable German notes fell to 0.88 percent, from 0.89 percent.  
 Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns to
forecast price changes.
