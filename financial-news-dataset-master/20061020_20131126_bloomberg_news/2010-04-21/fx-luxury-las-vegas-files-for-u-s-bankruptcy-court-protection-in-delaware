             A unit of FX Real Estate and
Entertainment Inc. that owns almost 18 acres of land on the Las
Vegas Strip filed for bankruptcy court protection from its
creditors.  
 FX Luxury Las Vegas I LLC listed assets of $139.7 million
and debt of $492.6 million in Chapter 11 documents filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Las Vegas.  
 The land, on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Harmon
Avenue, is near the center of the city’s resort district. It is
worth about $137.7 million, about half of the $268.1 million
secured loan on the property, according to court records.  
 “The company believes that the Las Vegas Property will be
liquidated,” FX Real Estate said in a regulatory filing earlier
this month. “It is extremely unlikely the company will receive
any benefit” from the sale, FX said in the filing.  
 The case is in re FX Luxury Las Vegas I, LLC 10-17015, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas).
