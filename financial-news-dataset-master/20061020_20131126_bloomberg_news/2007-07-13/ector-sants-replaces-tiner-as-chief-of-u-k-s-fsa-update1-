             The Financial Services Authority, the
U.K.'s market regulator, named  Hector Sants  as its new chief
executive officer.  
 Sants, 51, will take over from John Tiner in a week, the
London-based FSA said in an e-mailed statement today. Sants joined
the regulator in 2004 and is currently head of the wholesale and
institutional markets division. He was previously Credit Suisse
First Boston's chief executive of Europe,  Middle East  and Africa.  
 ``John Tiner and his senior management team have laid out a
clear path for the future of the organization,'' Sants said in the
statement. ``I plan to continue that agenda, ensuring that the FSA
itself -- and crucially its people -- are well-equipped to deal
with the complex and constantly changing financial services
industry.''  
 The FSA took over regulation of Britain's financial services
in 2001, overseeing the world's third-largest equity market and
most investment and trading firms. It's responsible for protecting
consumers and reducing crime such as  insider trading , money
laundering and fraud.  
 Tiner, 50, said in January that he would step down to take a
position in the private sector. He has been in the role since
2003.  
 Kitty Ussher, economic secretary to the Treasury in Prime
Minister  Gordon Brown 's government, said she welcomed the
appointment.  
 ``His extensive knowledge and experience of the financial
services market and the FSA will be invaluable,'' she said in an
e-mailed statement.
