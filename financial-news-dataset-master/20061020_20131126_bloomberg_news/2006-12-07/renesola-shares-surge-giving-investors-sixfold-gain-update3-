             Shares of  ReneSola Ltd. (SOL) , a Chinese
maker of wafers for solar-energy cells, climbed for a seventh
consecutive trading session in  London , giving investors in a
share sale four months ago a sixfold return.  
 The stock rose 14 pence, or 3 percent, to 477 pence in
London. The  shares  were sold in August at $1.50 (79 pence)
apiece. The Tortola, British Virgin Islands-based company is now
valued at 477 million pounds ($936 million). The stock closed at
222 pence on Nov. 28, the day before the gains began.  
 Global demand for solar panels is doubling every two years,
according to Renesola. China's share of global cell manufacturing
capacity has grown to more than 20 percent in 2005 from 1 percent
in 2001, making it the world's third-biggest cell-making nation,
according to the company. About 60 percent of Renesola's
customers are based in  China .  
 ``The stock is still very cheap, the solar market is growing
very strongly,'' Tien Yu Sieh, a  Hong Kong  based analyst at
Merrill Lynch & Co., said in a phone interview today. ``They have
effectively secured orders for their 2007 production and raw
materials for that year. That makes us comfortable.''  
 The analyst rates the stock a ``buy'' with a 12-month price
target of 800 pence. ReneSola plans to expand its production
capacity by 47 percent next year.  
 Directors of ReneSola held meetings with investors in the
U.S. this week, the company said yesterday.
