             Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (009540)  and
other shipbuilders in  Asia  fell for the seventh consecutive
trading day as concern about mortgage losses in the U.S. prompted
investors to sell stocks that have risen the most.  
 Hyundai Heavy, the world's largest shipyard, dropped 6.7
percent to 280,000 won, the lowest closing price in three months,
in  Seoul . The  stock  has more than doubled this year, the sharpest
gain among the 50 largest companies in  South Korea 's  Kospi index .
The Bloomberg Asia Pacific Shipbuilding Index fell as much as 7.7
percent.  
 Asian stocks slumped, with a key regional index, the Morgan
Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific Index, set for its
worst week in 17 years, as a mounting credit crisis prompts
investors to shun equities.  
 ``The shipyards are being hit more because they had led the
market gain earlier this year,'' said Lee Young Min, an analyst
at Kiwoom.com in Seoul. ``Fundamentally, nothing has changed.''  
 A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the world's largest shipping line,
and its peers have increased spending on vessels for about five
years to move raw materials to  China  and ship finished goods to
the U.S. and  Europe . That has helped shipyards in South Korea,
the world's biggest shipbuilding nation, and other Asian
countries to receive contracts at record prices.  
 Daewoo, STX  
 Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140) , the second-largest yard and
the index's third-biggest gainer this year, declined 7 percent to
36,100 won.  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. (042660)  dropped
3.2 percent to 41,350 won and  STX Shipbuilding Co. (067250)  fell 3.1
percent to 44,200 won.  
 Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. (7003)  dropped 16 percent,
the biggest decline since September 2001, to close at 527 yen in
 Tokyo , leading declines among Japanese shipbuilders.  Hitachi
Zosen Corp. (7004)  shares fell 15 percent to 175 yen, while Namura
Shipbuilding Co. was down 9.8 percent to 1,649 yen.  
 Mitsui Engineering and Hitachi Zosen were second and third-biggest decliners in  Japan 's Nikkei 225 index, which plunged 5.4
percent, its worst daily performance since the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks.  
 Guangzhou Shipyard International Co. (317) , China's first publicly
traded shipbuilder, tumbled as much as 27 percent, the biggest
decline ever, to HK$30.60 before closing at HK$39.05. It has more
than tripled this year, leading advances in the Bloomberg World
Shipbuilding Index.  
 The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks stocks
of mainland Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong, fell 3 percent
after dropping as much as 10 percent.  
 Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings Ltd. (YZJSGD) , the country's
second-largest private shipbuilder, dropped as much as 15 percent,
the biggest decline since it started trading in  Singapore  in
April, to S$1.36 before closing at S$1.51.  
 Keppel (KEP) , the biggest maker of shallow-water rigs, fell as
much as 11 percent to S$10.10 in the island city, before closing
at S$11.1.
