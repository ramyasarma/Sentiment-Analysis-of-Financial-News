             Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp., the U.S.
steelmaker merging with Esmark Inc., said it agreed with its
banks on a new $350 million credit facility that will help the
company avoid a liquidity crisis amid widening losses.  
 The facility and a new $135 million term loan will replace
a $225 million loan and help finance near-term obligations,
Wheeling, West Virginia-based Wheeling-Pitt said today in a
statement.  
 Wheeling-Pitt said last week it may break debt agreements
after mounting losses and that its auditors had ``substantial
doubt'' about the company's ability to continue operations.  
 ``This agreement in principle represents an important next
step to facilitate the merger with Esmark,'' Wheeling-Pitt Chief
Executive Officer James Bouchard said in the statement today.  
 Wheeling-Pittsburgh shares rose $1.65, or 11 percent, to
$16.18 in Nasdaq Stock Market composite  trading . The shares have
declined 14 percent this year.  
 The company had a second-quarter loss of $41.6 million, or
$2.71 per share, compared with profit of $9.3 million, or 63
cents, a year earlier.
