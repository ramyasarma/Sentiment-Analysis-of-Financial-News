             OAO Aeroflot, eastern  Europe 's
largest airline, expects to pay a maximum $5.8 billion to buy 44
airliners from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co., a discount of at least
17 percent.  
 The state-controlled carrier will pay ``no more than'' $2.9
billion for 22 Airbus A350 XWB models and $2.9 billion for 22
Boeing 787 Dreamliners, Leonid Dushatin, an Aeroflot board
member, said by phone from Moscow today. Dushatin is also first
deputy chief executive officer of National Reserve Corp., which
owns 30 percent of the airline.  
 ``This is an estimate, this is the most the airline will
pay,'' Dushatin said. ``Most likely the contract price will be
lower.''  
 The sales contracts for the planes are valued at more than
$7 billion at list prices, which don't take account of incentives
the planemakers offer for large purchases. Shareholders of
Moscow-based Aeroflot are scheduled to vote on the order Sept. 4.
The board last month approved buying the 44 airliners, which will
seat between 250 and 350 people, to upgrade the fleet as of 2014.  
 Aeroflot will also offer to buy out investors who don't
support the plane purchase, Dushatin said, adding that it's
standard procedure for approving a large contract. The carrier
will pay 58.85 rubles per common share.  
 The airline's  shares  on the Moscow-based Micex Stock
Exchange fell 0.4 percent to 68.95 rubles, valuing the company at
76.6 billion rubles ($3 billion).  
 ``The buyout price is small,'' said Dushatin. ``But we will
support the jet purchase along with the majority shareholder.''
