             OAO Silvinit and  OAO Uralkali (URKA) ,
 Russia ’s largest potash producers, fell after the government
said it may impose a 15 percent tax on exports of the mineral
used to make fertilizer.  
 Several ministries are discussing the tax and the
competition watchdog supports it, Teimuraz Kharitonashvili, head
of the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service’s chemical division, said
by phone in Moscow today.  
 A 5 percent export tax was in force until April. The
government didn’t extend that tariff because of the economic
crisis, and on the condition that potash producers curb prices
for domestic buyers.  
 Tax at 15 percent would hurt profit at Berezniki-based
Uralkali, said  Luis Saenz , vice president of international sales
at brokerage Otkritie Securities Ltd. Uralkali’s  earnings  before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization were $224.8 million
in the first half of 2009.  
 “A back-of-the-envelope calculation for a 15% reduction in
sales will result in more than 30% decrease in Ebitda,” Saenz
wrote in a note.  
 Silvinit slid 1,203.61 rubles, or 5.4 percent, to 21,995.39
rubles ($704) in Moscow. Uralkali depositary receipts declined
$1.93, or 9 percent, to $19.52 in  London , the biggest drop since
Oct. 28.
