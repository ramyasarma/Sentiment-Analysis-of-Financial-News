             OAO Comstar United Telesystems, the
Russian telecommunications company controlled by billionaire
 Vladimir Yevtushenkov , forecast revenue from regional operations
will grow more than 13 times as it expands in areas outside
Moscow and buys assets.  
 Comstar will increase regional sales to $550 million in
2011 from $42 million last year, the Moscow-based company said
today in a presentation to reporters. Comstar earlier today said
it paid $167.4 million for Digital Telephone Networks South, the
largest rival to incumbent OAO Svyazinvest in southern  Russia .  
 The Digital Telephone ``acquisition is good news from the
strategy perspective,'' Deutsche Bank AG said today in a comment
to investors. ``Selective regional expansion was one of the
promises that Comstar made in its IPO and the DTN deal is the
largest (and one of the few) on the company's execution
checklist which has been delivered so far.''  
 Comstar raised more than $1 billion in an initial public
offering in February 2006. The company said it would look beyond
its main market of the Russian capital, whose dominant fixed-
line phone provider, OAO Moscow City Phone, it controls.  
 Comstar's depositary receipts  rose 20 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $12.70 as of 11:13 a.m. in London trading. They have
climbed from $7.25 each since the IPO.  
 ``We have a strategy and we have started to fulfill it,''
Comstar Chief Executive Officer Sergei Pridantsev told reporters
today. ``Comstar is beginning to fulfill promises. It is
building and buying.''  
 Regional Growth  
 Comstar adopted a new regional development program late
last month. Comstar has forecast it will earn $200 million in
2011 from regional organic growth and another $300 million from
acquisitions.  
 The company  forecasts it will earn $50 million from long-
distance-call services in 2011. It will invest $120 million over
the next four years in existing regional assets.  
 Pridantsev declined to say whether there will be any more
acquisitions by the end of this year. Comstar said Nov. 13 it
paid $21 million for the Regional Technical Center, a fixed-line
phone operator in the oil-rich Khanty-Mansiisk area. Comstar in
August bought Sochitelecomservice, a fixed-line phone company
and Internet provider, in the Russian city of Sochi where the
2014 Winter Olympics will be held.
