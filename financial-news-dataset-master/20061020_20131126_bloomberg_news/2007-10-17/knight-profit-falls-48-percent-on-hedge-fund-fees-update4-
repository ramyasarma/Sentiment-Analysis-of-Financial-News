             Knight Capital Group Inc., the No. 2
matchmaker for Nasdaq stocks, said third-quarter net income fell
48 percent as its hedge-fund unit lost money.  
 Profit dropped to $16.4 million, or 17 cents a share, from
$31.5 million, 30 cents, a year earlier, the  Jersey City , New
Jersey-based company said in a statement today. Revenue fell 3.2
percent to $204.9 million.  
 Knight last month fell to its lowest since January 2006 in
 New York  trading amid concern that the company may have to refund
management fees collected by its Deephaven Capital Management LLC
hedge fund as declines in stock and credit markets hurt returns.
Chief Executive Officer Thomas Joyce has tried to lift the stock
by boosting electronic trading, repurchasing shares and selling a
majority stake in the company's electronic equity market.  
 ``I don't think anything is broken,'' Joyce told investors
on a conference call today. ``We certainly want to enhance the
stuff that is growing more rapidly like the electronic trading
business. We are focusing on growing and even more so on what is
growing fastest.''  
 Knight pared an earlier loss of as much as 8.8 percent after
the conference call, losing 12 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $13.25
at 4:30 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The company has lost
almost a third of its value this year, compared with a 2.9
percent decline in the American Stock Exchange Broker Dealer
Index that tracks 12 competitors.  
 `Continue To Buy It'  
 Knight repurchased $76.5 million in shares last quarter as
part of a $505 million program authorized by the company's board
in July. ``We absolutely believe in the stock here and will
continue to buy it,'' Joyce said. ``The only constraint would be
the ability to use our resources to do an accretive deal.''  
 Excluding an 8-cent gain from the sale of a majority stake
in the Direct Edge equity market, Knight earned 9 cents a share
before taxes. The company was expected to earn 12 cents,
according to the average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 Deephaven lost $8.3 million before taxes, compared with a
pretax gain of $18.4 million a year earlier. All Deephaven funds
combined declined 1.8 percent in the third quarter, compared with
a gain of 4.9 percent a year earlier. Deephaven managed $4.2
billion as of Sept. 30, including $199.6 million from Knight, and
garnered $11 million in asset management fees in the third
quarter.  
 A loss for the final six months of this year may require
Deephaven to return a ``substantial portion'' of the $68.4
million in incentive fees collected from investors in the first
half, Knight said in an August regulatory filing. Based on
Deephaven's returns for the third quarter, the fund would have
had to return $12.2 million to investors, the company said.  
 Less Than Expected  
 Deephaven's loss was less than expected by Banc of America
Securities analyst  Chris Allen , who has a ``buy'' rating on the
stock. Knight's $140 million  credit line , secured earlier this
month, may allow the company to repurchase more than $56 million
in shares during the fourth quarter, Allen said.  
 ``We expect them to be very active buying back shares moving
forward,'' Allen wrote in a report to clients today.  
 Knight's trading unit, which trails Zurich-based UBS AG in
matching Nasdaq stocks, reaped $32.2 million before taxes,
compared with $27.5 million a year earlier. The value of shares
handled by the company more than doubled from a year earlier to
$877 billion.
