Brazil’s real posted the biggest
weekly advance since June as investors speculated potential
government measures will fail to halt dollar inflows following
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA ’s $70 billion share sale.  The real weakened 0.1 percent to 1.6897 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 1.6873 yesterday, paring its weekly
gain to 1.3 percent.  Repsol YPF SA said today its Brazilian unit will get a $7.1
billion investment from China Petrochemical Corp. in the second-
largest overseas purchase by a Chinese company. Central bank
President  Henrique Meirelles  said earlier this week that Brazil
is considering higher taxes on capital entering the country
after Petrobras, the state oil company, held the world’s biggest
share sale.  “We’re talking about benign, long-term flows,”  Leonardo Kestelman , Brazil head of Dinosaur Securities Inc., said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “There’s not much the government can do.
There’s only news to make the dollar weaken.”  In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January 2012 fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 11.44 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
