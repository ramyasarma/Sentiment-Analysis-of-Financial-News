Motorola Inc.  settled a lawsuit it
filed against two  Iridium Communications Inc.  units in February,
alleging they owe the mobile-phone maker $24.7 million.  Terms of the accord resolving the case in Illinois state
court in Chicago are confidential,  Iridium  said today in a
statement.  Tama McWhinney , a Motorola spokeswoman, confirmed a
settlement was reached while also declining to disclose the
terms.  “We filed the action to protect our legitimate
interests,” McWhinney said in a phone interview.  Motorola , based in Schaumburg, Illinois, claimed in its
complaint that it was owed the money under the terms of a loan
made to Iridium Satellite LLC in 2000. The loan was guaranteed
by Iridium Holdings LLC, according to Motorola.  Iridium, based in McLean, Virginia, provides voice and data
communications using Earth-orbiting satellites.  Motorola  said in August that it would put $3.5 billion into
a planned spinoff company that would include its mobile phone
and television set-top box units.  It said the new business will be known as Motorola
Mobility. The remainder of the company, which will make bar-code
scanners and two-way radios, will be called Motorola Solutions.  The case is Motorola Inc. v. Iridium Satellite Inc.,
10CH5684, Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court, Chancery
Division (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
