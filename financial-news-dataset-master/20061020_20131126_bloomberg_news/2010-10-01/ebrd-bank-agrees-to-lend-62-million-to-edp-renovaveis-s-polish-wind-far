The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development will grant a 178 million zloty ($62 million)
loan to co-finance the construction and operation of an EDP
Renovaveis SA wind farm in northwestern Poland, the bank said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The renewable-energy unit of Portuguese utility EDP-
Energias de Portugal SA completed the 120-megawatt project,
Poland’s largest wind farm, in Margonin in October last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
