Visteon Corp. , once the second-
largest U.S. maker of auto parts, emerged from bankruptcy
protection today after reducing its debt by about $2.1 billion.  More than 40  bondholders , including the distressed-
investment units of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman,
Sachs & Co., and hedge fund manager Stark Investments, agreed to
invest $300 million in Visteon and buy $950 million of new
shares when Visteon exits bankruptcy.  Visteon strengthened its balance sheet while in bankruptcy
and had $979 million in cash as of June 30. The company got 39
percent of its  revenue  in Asia last quarter, up from 17 percent
in 2005, which should appeal to  investors ,  Kirk Ludtke , an
analyst with CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford, Connecticut.  “For investors that want to gain exposure to Asia and at
the same time invest in a U.S.-based company that reports on
U.S. GAAP and trades on U.S. exchanges, this is a nice
combination,” Ludtke said in a telephone interview Sept. 27.  Ludtke yesterday raised his target price for the shares,
when issued, to $67 from $58, and recommends investors buy them.  Visteon, a former division of  Ford Motor Co. , filed for
protection from creditors in May 2009, citing the faltering
economy and slowing auto sales. The Van Buren Township,
Michigan-based company said today in a statement that it exited
bankruptcy with about $600 million in debt, compared with about
$2.7 billion when it entered protection.  Visteon trades on the over-the-counter market.  Jim Fisher ,
a company spokesman, declined to say when the shares may begin
trading on a larger exchange.  Auto Sales Plunge  U.S. auto sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 9.34 million in February 2009, less than half the 20.7
million rate from July 2005, as a global recession,  job losses 
and declining home values and stock prices caused consumers to
slow spending.  Automakers and suppliers representing 38 percent of the
North American auto industry, including General Motors Corp.,
Chrysler LLC and  Lear Corp. , filed for bankruptcy protection in
2009, according to consulting firm AlixPartners LLP.  Visteon, which makes heating and air-conditioning systems,
door panels and engine-cooling systems, had sales of $6.69
billion last year, 66 percent less than its peak year of 2000.
The company, led by Chief Executive Officer  Don Stebbins ,
employs about 26,000, compared with 82,000 in 1998. About 1,200
of the remaining workers are in the U.S., and it has one factory
in the country, in Shorter, Alabama.  Ford Spinoff  Visteon was spun off from Ford in June 2000 to give it more
freedom to sell to other automakers. Ford accounted for 88
percent of its $19.4 billion in  revenue  the year before the
spinoff.  The supplier followed a path similar to Delphi Automotive
LLP, once the largest U.S. auto-parts maker, which was spun off
from General Motors in 1999 and declared insolvency in 2005.
Delphi exited bankruptcy in October 2009.  Visteon was hurt by higher labor costs. In 2005, trying to
end five years of losses, Visteon returned 23 plants and offices
to Ford and shed responsibility for 18,000 workers represented
by the United Auto Workers union. That allowed Visteon to lower
its average hourly wage to $18 from $38 in 2005.  The company closed or divested 30 factories or units from
2006 to 2008 and trimmed its reliance on Ford to 28 percent of
sales last year. Visteon has reported one annual  profit  as an
independent company.  Ford and Hyundai Kia Automotive Group, Visteon’s largest
customers, represented 55 percent of last year’s revenue. No
other customer makes up more than 10 percent of sales.  Visteon received 38 percent of its revenue last year from
the U.S. and 35 percent from Asia, including 24 percent in South
Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
