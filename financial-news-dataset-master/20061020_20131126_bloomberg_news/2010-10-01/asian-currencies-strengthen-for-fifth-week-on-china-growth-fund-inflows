Asian currencies completed a fifth
weekly advance, the longest winning streak since March, as
global funds pumped more money into Asian assets to profit from
the world’s fastest economic growth.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index  climbed to a two-
year high after the Asian Development Bank this week raised its
2010 growth forecast for Asia excluding Japan to 8.2 percent,
from an April estimate of 7.5 percent. Data today showed
manufacturing in China, the biggest buyer of exports from South
Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, expanded in September at the fastest
pace in four months.  “When we see China picking up, it’s good news for all
Asia,” said  Nalin Chutchotitham , a financial markets analyst at
Kasikornbank Pcl in Bangkok. “Investors like emerging Asia
because of its economic performance. That supports the regional
currencies.”  South Korea’s won led gains with a 2.2 percent weekly jump
to 1,130.45 per dollar in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Thai baht and India’s rupee were the next best
performers, advancing 1.6 percent to 30.22 and 1.5 percent to
44.60, respectively, as of 4:38 p.m. in Hong Kong.  Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.2 percent in 2010,
outpacing growth of 2.6 percent in advanced countries, the
International Monetary Fund forecast in July. Equity funds
investing in the region took in $6.3 billion in the last three
months, drawing more than $3 billion of that in the second half
of September, according to research firm EPFR Global.  China Output  China’s  purchasing managers’ index  rose for a second month
in September and by more than had been predicted in a Bloomberg
survey, the nation’s logistics federation and statistics bureau
said today. South Korea today reported 17.2 percent growth in
exports for last month, more than the 15.7 percent gain forecast
in a separate Bloomberg poll.  The won today touched a four-month high of 1,130.03 per
dollar after a report showing the fastest inflation in 17 months
stoked speculation the central bank will raise interest rates in
October. Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier in
September, more than the 2.9 percent increase forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  The central bank, which aims to keep inflation between 2
percent and 4 percent through 2012, left its  benchmark interest
rate  at 2.25 percent at the last two monthly reviews following a
quarter of a percentage point increase in July.  Rate Rises  “Faster inflation builds the case for interest rates to
rise, prompting the won to strengthen,” said  Yun Se Min  , a
Seoul-based currency trader for Busan Bank. “And right now the
market consensus is for a rate hike next month, which is why we
expect to see the currency keep strengthening toward year-end.”  India’s rupee advanced to its strongest level in almost
five months after the central bank said in a report yesterday
the capital account had a surplus of $17.5 billion in the three
months through June, more than offsetting a shortfall of $13.7
billion in the current account.  Taiwan’s dollar hit a two-year high of $31.066 versus the
greenback after the central bank late yesterday raised its
benchmark interest  rate  by 12.5 basis points to 1.5 percent. The
currency rose 1 percent from a week ago to NT$31.31.  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit advanced 0.3 percent this
week to 3.084 per dollar, contributing to an 11 percent gain for
2010. The Singapore dollar added 0.8 percent to S$1.3142 and
Indonesia’s rupiah rose 0.4 percent to 8,918.  To contact the reporter on this story:
