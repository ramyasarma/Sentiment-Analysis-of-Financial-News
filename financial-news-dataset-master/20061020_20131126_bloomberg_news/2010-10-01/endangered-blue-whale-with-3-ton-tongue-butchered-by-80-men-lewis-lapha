In 1948, a Japanese whaling fleet
with 1,300 men set off for the Antarctic. There was an oil
tanker, storage and processing ships and a 10,000 ton factory,
the Hashidate Maru. Arriving, they quickly killed their first
whale, a gigantic blue, one of the largest ever caught.  The animal’s tongue alone weighed three tons, and its heart
was as big as a Volkswagen. Butchering the 300,000-pound carcass
took 80 men four hours. And then they went out for more, using
sonar, exploding harpoons and other high-tech killing devices.
An efficient factory fleet was capable of taking as many as 70
whales in a day.  The blue whale is the largest animal known to exist, with
no real natural predators, and owing to its great power and
speed, it eluded the early whalers. But during the 20th century,
360,000 blue whales were destroyed, and it was estimated that by
the 1960s only about 1,000 were left to swim the oceans.  The  International Whaling Commission  banned the hunting of
the blue in 1966, and during the following decade illegal
killing by the Soviets was finally stopped. Though it is no
longer legally hunted anywhere, the blue whale remains
endangered and total numbers are impossible to determine.  I spoke with  Philip Hoare , author of “The Whale: In Search
of the Giants of the Sea,” on the following topics:  1. Anatomy of Leviathan  2. “Moby-Dick”  3. Processing the Whale  4. Global Industry  5. Swimming with Whales  To listen to the podcast, click  here . To buy this book in North
