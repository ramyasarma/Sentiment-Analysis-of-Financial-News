The New York Mets plan to relieve
General Manager  Omar Minaya  and manager  Jerry Manuel 
of their roles,  SI.com reported .  Minaya may stay with the organization, while the Major
League Baseball team won’t renew an option on Manuel’s contract,
SI.com said, citing unidentified people.  Mets Vice President for Media Relations  Jay Horwitz 
said in a telephone interview that the Mets won’t comment on the
report or announce decisions until after the season ends on Oct.
3.  Minaya was named general manager in 2004 after three
seasons with the Montreal Expos. Manuel has led the team to a
202-212 record since being named manager upon  Willie Randolph ’s
firing in June 2008.  The Mets are 77-82, 13 games behind the Philadelphia
Phillies in the NL East. The team was mathematically eliminated
from playoff contention on Sept. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
