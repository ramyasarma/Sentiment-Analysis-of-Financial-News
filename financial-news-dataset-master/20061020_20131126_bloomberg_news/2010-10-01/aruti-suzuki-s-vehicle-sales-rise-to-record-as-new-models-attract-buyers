Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. , the
nation’s biggest carmaker, said sales rose to a record in
September for a second month as new models and an accelerating
economy spurred demand.  Maruti  sold 108,006 vehicles in India and overseas last
month, 30 percent more than a year ago, the New Delhi-based
automaker said in an e-mailed statement today. Exports gained
9.8 percent to 12,858 units.  Sales at the  Suzuki Motor Corp.  unit has gained for 21
straight months as the automaker introduced the Ritz hatchback
and other models amid rising competition from Volkswagen AG and
Ford Motor Co. Maruti is expanding factories to meet surging
demand in Asia’s third-biggest economy as higher disposable
incomes spur spending.  Maruti  rose  as much as 3.3 percent to 1,488 rupees in
Mumbai and changed hands at 1,486 rupees at 10:04 a.m. The
shares have fallen 4.8 percent this year.  Sales during the April-September period crossed half a
million units, growing at 26 percent, Maruti said.  India’s economy grew 8.8 percent in the quarter ended June
30, the fastest pace in two-and-a-half years. The government
expects vehicle sales to reach 3 million units by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
