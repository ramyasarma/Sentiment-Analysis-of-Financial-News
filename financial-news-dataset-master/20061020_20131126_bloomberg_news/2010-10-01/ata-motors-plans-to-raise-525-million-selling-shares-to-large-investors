Tata Motors Ltd. , the owner of Jaguar
Land Rover, started selling $525 million of shares to
institutional investors, two people with direct knowledge of the
matter said.  The sale will include $325 million of shares with
differential voting rights, the people said, declining to be
named before an official announcement. The company will sell
common stock for 1,074 rupees apiece and those with limited
voting rights at 764 rupees, one of the people said.  Tata Motors’  shares  rose 1.5 percent to 1,114.15 rupees at
the 3:30 p.m. local time close of trading. The Mumbai-based
company, which has gained 41 percent this year, said in June
that it plans to raise as much as 47 billion rupees ($1 billion)
to pare debt and expand operations.  Citigroup Inc  and  Credit Suisse Group AG  were hired to help
the company raise funds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Debasis Ray, a spokesman for the company, couldn’t be
reached on his cell phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
