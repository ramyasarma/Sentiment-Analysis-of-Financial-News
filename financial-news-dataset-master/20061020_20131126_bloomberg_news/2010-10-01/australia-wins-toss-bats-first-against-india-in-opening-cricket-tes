Australia captain Ricky Ponting won
the toss and elected to bat first against India in the series-
opening cricket Test in Mohali.  India, the No. 1-ranked Test team, holds the Border-
Gavaskar Trophy after a 2-0 win at home two years ago. Australia
is the only team to have won a Test series in India during the
past 10 years.  If Australia loses the two-match contest, it will fall one
place to fifth in the International Cricket Council’s rankings
and begin the Ashes series ranked lower than England.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
