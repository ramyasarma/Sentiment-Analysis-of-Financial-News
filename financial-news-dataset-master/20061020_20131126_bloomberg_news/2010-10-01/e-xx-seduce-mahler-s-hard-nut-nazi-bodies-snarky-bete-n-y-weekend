Grab this chance to hear Gustav
Mahler’s enigmatic Sixth Symphony.  Back for his second season as the New York Philharmonics’s
music director,  Alan Gilbert  takes on the 80-minute score,
described by Mahler himself as a “hard nut.”  Mahler led the orchestra 1909-1911 and introduced American
audiences to his Sixth Symphony, so Gilbert has some pretty big
patent-leather evening slippers to fill.  At Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, 65th Street and
Broadway. Information: +1-212-875-5656;  http://nyphil.org   Then try Atlantic Grill, which has taken over the late,
lamented O’Neal’s, and have a Lincoln Center-inspired cocktail:
The Gilbert is concocted with Wild Turkey, Tea Vodka, ginger
beer and Creme de Cacao. Or toast the memory of Sills with the
Beverly, a mix of Macchu Pisco, blood orange, Aperol and
Tincture of Kaffir.  Ask for a booth and ponder ordering the shellfish tower
crammed with lobster, king crab, shrimp, clams, oysters,
marinated mussels and ceviche.  Atlantic Grill is at 49 W. 64th St. Information: +1-212-
787-4663.  Saturday  The Guggenheim Museum’s new show displays painting,
sculpture, photography, architecture, film and fashion in that
fraught period between the two world wars when a yearning for
beauty stirred many artists.  Eighty are represented, including Picasso, Braque, Dix,
Leger, Matisse and Morandi, with many of the works on view in
the U.S. for the first time.  Included is the 1936 Olympics film by Leni Riefenstahl, a
perfect document of how the classical ideal was co-opted by the
Nazis in their insane search for human perfection.  “Chaos and Classicism: Art in France, Italy and Germany,
1918-1936” is at the Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Ave.

monster. In  David Hirson ’s crackling farce “La Bete,” an
egotistical buffoon played by the great comic actor  Mark Rylance 
comes up against the high-minded leader of a theatrical troupe,
here portrayed by the equally splendid  David Hyde Pierce .  The verbal pyrotechnics pit art against commerce in a
rollicking satire as pertinent today as in the play’s 18th-
century setting.  “La Bete” is at the Music Box Theatre, 239 W. 45th St.

list and a staggering array of perfectly ripened cheeses.  Casellula is at 401 W. 52nd St; +1-212-247-8137.  Saturday Night  Fresh from picking up their Mercury Prize for Best Album of
the Year in London,  The xx  bring their seductive magic to United
Palace.  With less savvy treatment, the band’s clear, cold girl-boy
vocals could come off as an 80’s retrograde shtick. But Romy,
Oliver and Jamie conjure perfectly the atmosphere of the
breathless and the love-sick.  Warpaint and  Zola Jesus  open. Wear black.  United Palace is at 4140 Broadway. Information: +1-212-568-
5260;  http://unitedpalaceconcerts.com   Sunday  Horrified by the carnage of the Second World War, artists
reached back in time for inspiration: They created imagery
evoking ancient myths and even a pre-human world.  The abstract expressionists also moved the primary art-
world action from Paris to New York.  The Museum of Modern Art is showing 250 works from its
unparalleled collection, so here’s your chance to see  Jackson Pollock ,  Willem de Kooning ,  Mark Rothko  and their contemporaries
in full creative frenzy.  When MoMA bought Rothko’s “No. 10” in 1952, one outraged
museum trustee quit on the spot.  While there, check out “Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913-
1917” before it closes later this month.  MoMA is located at 11 W. 53 St. Information: +1-212-708-

shaking, wiggling, wrestling and convulsing.  Carrie Ahern’s “Sensate” takes place across the street
from the New York Stock Exchange on two underground floors of a
former bank vault.  Inspired by the writings of  Friedrich Nietzsche , the dance
installation with six performers lasts three hours.  No worries: Visitors are encouraged to come and go as they
please.  At The Vaults, 14 Wall St. Information:
