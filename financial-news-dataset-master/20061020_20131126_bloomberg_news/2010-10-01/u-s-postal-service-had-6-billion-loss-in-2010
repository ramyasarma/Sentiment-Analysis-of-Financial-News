The U.S. Postal Service, whose
request for a rate increase was turned down this week, had a $6
billion loss in the fiscal year that ended yesterday, Postmaster
General  John Potter  said.  The agency, which sought permission from its regulator to
raise rates an average of 5.6 percent, had forecast a loss of $7
billion in the 2010 fiscal year. The loss is before a $2 billion
non-cash adjustment for workers’ compensation liability, which
is increasing because of lower interest rates, Potter told
reporters today in Washington.  The Postal Service paid a required contribution to a fund
for future retiree health benefits and may spend through its
cash in the 2011 fiscal year, Potter said.  “Cash will be tight going through the year, particularly
at the beginning of the year,” he said. The Postal Service
could “literally run out of cash in September 2011 because we
will have exhausted all of our borrowing authority.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
