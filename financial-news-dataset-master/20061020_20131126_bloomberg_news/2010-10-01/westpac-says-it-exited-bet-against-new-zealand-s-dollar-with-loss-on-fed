Westpac Banking Corp. said it exited
a bet that the New Zealand dollar would decline against its U.S.
counterpart as speculation the Federal Reserve will resume asset
purchases overshadowed weaker local economic data.  “We have been stopped out of our short New Zealand dollar-
U.S. dollar position with the rate moving 2 percent against
us,” analysts at Westpac wrote in an e-mailed note today. Data
in New Zealand has not been reflected in the currency, signaling
that “non-domestic factors are dominant at present, notably the
Fed-inspired anti-dollar sentiment,” they wrote.  The so-called Kiwi dollar gained 1 percent to 74.19 U.S.
cents as of 4:21 p.m. in London. It jumped 7.2 percent in the
third quarter, the biggest increase since the three months
through Sept. 30, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
