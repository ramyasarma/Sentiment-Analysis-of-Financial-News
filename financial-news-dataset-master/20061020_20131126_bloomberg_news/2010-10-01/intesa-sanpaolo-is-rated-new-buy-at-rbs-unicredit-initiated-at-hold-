Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
initiated coverage of  UniCredit SpA  and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA ,
setting a “hold” rating on Italy’s biggest bank and a “buy”
recommendation on the country’s second-biggest.  “Negative cyclical drivers, including stagnant economic
growth and the low level of market rates, are likely to continue
to affect both banks’ profitability throughout 2011 and to
prevent return on tangible common equity - RoTCE - from covering
the cost of capital,” London-based analysts  Paola Biraschi  and
 Raoul Leonard  wrote in a note today. “The sector and the stocks
should re-rate to price in mid-cycle profitability levels, which
we assume will be reached in 2013.”  The brokerage noted that “Intesa Sanpaolo’s higher RoTCE
in 2013, driven by lower credit costs and cost income ratios, is
not correctly priced in by the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
