Rising bond yields for so-called euro
area peripheral nations are working as a “discipline tool” by
encouraging nations including Spain and Portugal to impose
measures to cut their deficits, BNP Paribas SA said.  “The budget announcements in Spain and Portugal are
evidence that market pressure is still bearing fruit, acting as
a discipline tool,” London-based economists  Luigi Speranza  and
 Eoin O’Callaghan  wrote today in a research note. “This is
certainly a positive element looking forward. At the same time,
there are still a number of risks. Episodes of further market
tensions remain likely over the next weeks and months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
