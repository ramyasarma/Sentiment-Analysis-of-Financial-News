Crude oil may rise next week on
speculation that U.S. inventories will drop as the economic
rebound accelerates, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Fifteen of 36 analysts, or 42 percent, forecast crude oil
will increase through Oct. 8. Thirteen respondents, or 36
percent, predicted a decline, and eight estimated prices will be
little changed. Last week, 57 percent said crude would decrease.  “Oil is getting support from a lot of outside factors,”
said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc.
in New York. “Positive economic data and the strength of the
stock market over the past month have supported the market.”  The U.S. economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, revised figures from the Commerce Department
showed yesterday. The increase in gross domestic product
compares with a 1.6 percent estimate issued last month. Separate
reports showed that business activity in the U.S. unexpectedly
accelerated and fewer workers filed claims for jobless benefits.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 8.8 percent in September.  Crude oil supplies slipped 475,000 barrels to 357.9 million
last week, according to an Energy Department report on Sept. 29.
Gasoline stockpiles tumbled 3.47 million barrels to 222.6
million, the biggest decline since Oct. 9, 2009. Consumption of
the motor fuel jumped 6.1 percent last week to 9.38 million
barrels a day, the biggest one-week increase since Feb. 19, the
report showed.  Crude oil for November delivery has increased 4.5 percent
to $79.97 a barrel this week on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Prices are up 13 percent from a year ago.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
