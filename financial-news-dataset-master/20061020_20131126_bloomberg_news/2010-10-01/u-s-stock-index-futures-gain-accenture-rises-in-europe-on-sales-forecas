U.S. stocks gained, building on the
biggest September rally since 1939, as higher-than-estimated
consumer spending and confidence bolstered optimism in the
economic recovery.  Schlumberger Ltd. and  Occidental Petroleum Corp . rose at
least 1.3 percent as oil topped $81 a barrel, leading energy
stocks to the biggest gain among 10 groups in the  Standard &
Poor’s 500  Index. Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
rallied more than 1.9 percent as financial companies rebounded
from two days of declines.  Accenture Plc  jumped 4.5 percent
after forecasting sales that may top estimates.  The  S&P  500 advanced 0.4 percent to 1,146.24 as of 4 p.m.
in New York, a 0.2 percent decline for the week. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 41.63 points, or 0.4 percent, to
10,829.68. Stocks also rose after Federal Reserve Bank of New
York President William Dudley said the central bank will
probably need to take action to spur the recovery and avert
deflation.  “As long as personal spending continues to creep up, one
can’t be negative about the economy or the market,” said
 Stanley Nabi , New York-based vice chairman of Silvercrest Asset
Management Group, which oversees $9 billion. “Personal spending
and income haven’t recovered fully, but they increased. What it
tells us is the economy will slog along between now and the
middle of next year.”  Consumer Purchases  Stocks  rallied  in the first half hour of trading as
Commerce Department data showed consumer purchases rose 0.4
percent in August, exceeding the 0.3 percent median increase
projected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Incomes were
up 0.5 percent, the biggest advance this year. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan measure of consumer confidence
declined less than forecast, signaling the largest part of the
economy may be stabilizing.  All 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 advanced last month,
sending the index to an 8.8 percent September rally and erasing
its loss for 2010, amid speculation the world’s largest economy
will avoid slipping back into a recession and bets that the
Federal Reserve will buy more debt to support the recovery.  U.S. equities erased gains briefly after the Institute for
Supply Management’s manufacturing index fell to 54.4 in
September, the slowest expansion in 10 months, underscoring the
Fed’s forecast of “modest” U.S. growth in coming months.
Readings greater than 50 signal growth. Economists forecast a
decline to 54.5, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Dudley said today the outlook for U.S. employment growth
and inflation is “unacceptable,” suggesting the central bank
may have to boost purchases of Treasuries, a measure known as
quantitative easing, to spur growth and avert deflation.  ‘Additional Stimulus’  “The U.S. economy is slowing but not dramatically and the
Fed is still likely to invoke some quantitative easing later
this year,” said  Jeffrey Kleintop , chief market strategist at
LPL Financial Corp. in Boston, which manages $280 billion. ISM
data “was weaker news but it also maybe makes it that much more
likely the Fed will step in with additional stimulus.”  Investors should raise their holdings in global equities
while cutting their weightings in government bonds and cash amid
the likelihood that companies will increase borrowing to boost
returns to shareholders, UBS AG said in a note.  “We expect equity markets to move higher despite a sub-par
recovery and the prospect of slower earnings growth,” said the
note, which was dated yesterday and written by chief economist
 Larry Hatheway  and other strategists in London and Stamford,
Connecticut.  The brokerage advised allocating 47 percent of holdings to
stocks, up from 45 percent previously.  Schlumberger, Occidental  Schlumberger added 1.3 percent to $62.43 and Occidental
Petroleum jumped 3.2 percent to $80.77. Energy companies in the
S&P 500 rallied 1.3 percent as a group as crude oil settled at
$81.58, the highest price since Aug. 5.  Citigroup jumped 4.6 percent to $4.09, the biggest gain in
the S&P 500. The U.S. Treasury Department said yesterday it
earned a $1.02 billion profit for taxpayers from the sale of a 5
percent stake in the third-largest U.S. bank. Financial
companies rallied 1.1 percent, the third-biggest gain among 10
groups in the S&P 500. JPMorgan Chase advanced the most in the
Dow, rallying 1.9 percent to $38.81.  Accenture gained 4.5 percent to $44.38. The world’s second-
largest technology-consulting firm forecast net revenue will be
$5.6 billion to $5.8 billion for the quarter ending in November.
Analysts had projected $5.62 billion, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  HP, Automakers  Hewlett-Packard Co. sank 3.1 percent to $40.77 after naming
former SAP AG Chief Executive Officer  Leo Apotheker  as its CEO
and president. The appointment prompted some analysts including
 Peter Goldmacher  at Cowen & Co. to speculate the two companies
may be set to forge closer ties or merge.  A  measure  of automakers and parts suppliers gained 0.2
percent after General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Group LLC said U.S. sales rose in September.  Deliveries at GM, the largest U.S. automaker, climbed 11
percent from a year earlier to 173,155, the Detroit-based
company said in a statement. Ford, the second-largest, increased
sales 41 percent to 160,873. Shares of Ford climbed 0.2 percent
to $12.26, the first gain in three days.  Materials  producers climbed 1.2 percent, the second-biggest
industry gain in the S&P 500. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. rose 4.4 percent to $89.13, after gold reached another
record, settling at $1,317.80 an ounce.  Gymboree, Green Mountain  Gymboree Corp. jumped 20 percent to $49.86, the biggest
intraday gain since April 2009, following a Wall Street Journal
report that the children’s clothing retailer may sell itself.
The newspaper didn’t say where it got the information. Calls and
e-mails to Gymboree weren’t returned.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. fell 5.2 percent to
$29.57, the lowest price since July 28. Nestle SA, the world’s
biggest food company, will begin selling Nescafe Dolce Gusto
coffee makers in 2,000 Wal-Mart stores across the U.S. this
month, taking on Green Mountain in its main market.  ChinaCache International Holdings Ltd. , the Beijing-based
provider of Internet content to businesses and government
agencies, almost doubled in its first day of trading after its
$84 million initial public offering. The American depositary
receipts surged 95 percent to $27.15, the biggest first-day gain
for a U.S. IPO since September 2007. ChinaCache sold 6.1 million
ADRs at $13.90 each after delaying the IPO for a day and
boosting the sale’s size from 5.5 million shares, according to a
 filing  with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Bloomberg
data.  The offering came after the number of Internet users in
China, the world’s fastest growing major economy, surpassed the
entire American population. While Liberty Mutual Agency Corp.
this week postponed the biggest U.S. IPO of 2010, China’s  SouFun
Holdings Ltd.  and  Country Style Cooking Restaurant Chain Co. 
have both rallied more than 50 percent since completing initial
sales in New York this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
