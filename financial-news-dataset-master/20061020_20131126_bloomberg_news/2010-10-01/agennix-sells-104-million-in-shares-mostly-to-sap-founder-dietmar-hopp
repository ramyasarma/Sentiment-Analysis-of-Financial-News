Agennix AG  raised about 76 million
euros ($104 million) in a share sale, boosting  SAP AG  co-founder
 Dietmar Hopp ’s ownership of the German biotechnology company to
almost 60 percent.  Hopp’s investment company Dievini Hopp BioTech Holding GmbH
bought most of the shares in the sale completed today, Agennix
Chief Financial Officer  Torsten Hombeck  said in an interview.
Hopp, who had held 29 percent of the company’s stock, has asked
the German financial regulator BaFin to waive a requirement that
owners of more than 30 percent of a company’s shares make an
offer to buy the rest, Hombeck said.  Hopp “has no interest in taking control of the company,
but rather supporting the company to get to data,” he said.  The shares were priced at 3.81 euros each and about 5
million euros-worth was bought by other investors, Hombeck said.
The sale gives Martinsried, Germany-based  Agennix  funding to
finish a final-stage study of its experimental cancer medicine
talactoferrin in non-small cell lung cancer, Hombeck said.
Results are expected by the end of next year, he said.  WestLB AG and Piper Jaffray Ltd. coordinated the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
