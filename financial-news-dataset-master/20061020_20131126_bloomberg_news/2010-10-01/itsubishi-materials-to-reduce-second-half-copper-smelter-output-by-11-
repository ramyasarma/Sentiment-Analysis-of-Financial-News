     Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Mitsubishi Materials Corp.,  Japan’s
third-largest copper producer, said it will reduce output by 11
percent at its Japanese smelters in the October-to-March period
compared with a year earlier because of maintenance closes.  The Tokyo-based company plans to produce 24,274 metric tons
of copper each month for the fiscal second half, compared with
monthly output of 27,304 tons in the same period a year earlier,
it said in a  statement  today.  The company attributed to the output drop to maintenance
shutdowns in its two domestic smelters, Hisato Matsubara, a
company spokesman, said by phone. Copper in London has climbed
10 percent this year and last traded at $8,076 a ton.  The company operates the Onahama smelter north of Tokyo,
with a capacity of 258,000 tons, and the Naoshima smelter, in
western Japan, with 225,000 tons.  Mitsubishi Materials has a 50 percent stake in Onahama. It
will close the Onahama smelter for maintenance for 14 days in
late October and shut the Naoshima smelter for 18 days in
February 2011,  Kenichi Watase , general manager in the company’s
sales department, said Sept. 15.  The following table details monthly production plans:  To contact the reporters on this story:
