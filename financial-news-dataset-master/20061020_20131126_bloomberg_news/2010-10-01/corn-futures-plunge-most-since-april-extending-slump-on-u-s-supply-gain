Corn futures plunged the most since
January after the U.S. said supplies left from last year’s crop
climbed to the highest level since 2006.  Inventories  on Sept. 1 rose 2 percent to 1.708 billion
bushels from a year earlier, the Department of Agriculture said
yesterday. That was 322 million bushels above the agency’s Sept.
10 estimate. Corn tumbled 30 cents today, the most allowed by
the Chicago Board of Trade. The grain surged 33 percent in the
third quarter, the most for that period since 1974.  “Supplies are more comfortable on paper, and that has
reduced the sense of urgency for end-users to jump back into the
market and add to positions,” said  Shawn McCambridge , the
senior grain analyst at Prudential Bache Commodities LLC in
Chicago.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 6.1 percent to
close at $4.6575 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the CBOT, the biggest
drop for a most-active contract since Jan. 12. The U.S. is the
world’s biggest producer and exporter.  In the third quarter, hedge funds increased bets on higher
prices to a record.  Fund managers and other large speculators increased their
net-long positions to 429,189 contracts in futures and options
in the week ended Sept. 28, up from 13,045 on June 29, according
to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  “We started to see funds liquidating long positions
yesterday, and it is continuing today,” McCambridge said.  ‘Active Rebalancing’  Funds sold an estimated 35,000 futures contracts today,
said  Charles Sernatinger , a vice president at ABN Amro Clearing
LLC in Chicago  In the third quarter, corn had the fourth-biggest gain
among 19 raw materials in the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index behind
sugar, wheat and cotton. Crude oil gained 5.7 percent.  “We had active rebalancing today with funds selling
agriculture and buying energy markets,” Sernatinger said. “You
have broken the backs of the bulls” who bet on falling U.S.
corn supplies, he said.  This week, oil jumped 6.7 percent, the most since mid-
February.  Corn also fell as forecasts for dry weather in the next two
weeks boosted harvest prospects, Prudential’s McCambridge said.  In September, the USDA predicted a record crop of 13.16
billion bushels (334.3 million metric tons), up 0.4 percent from
last year. The government will update its projection on Oct. 8.  “The harvest weather is a psychological negative factor,”
McCambridge said. “Farmers are busy harvesting, but most of the
crop is going into storage.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
