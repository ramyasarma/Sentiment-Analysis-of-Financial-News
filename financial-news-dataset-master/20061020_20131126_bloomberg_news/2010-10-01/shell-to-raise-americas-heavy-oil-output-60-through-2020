Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Europe’s
largest oil company, plans to raise its production of heavy
crude by 60 percent through 2020 in the Americas by expanding
projects and new developments.  Shell produced about 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day last year in the Americas, said John Abbott, executive vice
president for heavy oil, in a presentation yesterday on the
company’s website. The company can add at least 100,000 barrels
a day in heavy crude over the next decade, said  Marvin Odum ,
director of exploration and production in the Americas.  “The resource numbers are huge -- billions of barrels,”
Odum said in a  presentation  on Sept. 28.  The Hague-based company is examining plans to develop the
Carmon Creek project in Canada’s Peace River area, adding 80,000
barrels a day. At the same time, Shell and partners Chevron
Corp. and Marathon Oil Corp. plan to expand capacity by about
85,000 barrels a day at their Athabasca Oil Sands Project.  Carmon Creek will be developed in two phases to tap about
1.5 billion barrels of resources, according to Abbott’s
 presentation . He didn’t provide a timeframe.  Shell last month completed the first phase of its Jackpine
Mine project in northern Alberta, adding 100,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day to the existing 155,000 barrels a day output at
the Muskeg River Mine at Athabasca. The development brought 3.4
billion barrels of resources in production, according to Abbott.  Upgrade Phases  The project will be upgraded with a “debottlenecking” in
three phases over 10 years, according to Abbott. The first phase
will add 35,000 barrels a day of capacity at a cost of about $2
billion, the next will add 15,000 barrels and the third 35,000
barrels a day.  In the longer term, Shell  plans to expand  the Muskeg River
and Jackpine Mines and build the Pierre River Mine in Alberta,
which can access an additional 3.4 billion barrels of resources,
according to Abbott.  To contact the reporter on this story:
