U.S. auto sales in September
accelerated to the  fastest pace  since the federal government’s
“cash for clunkers” incentive program last year as deliveries
by the top 14 automakers all rose.  U.S. auto sales in September rose to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 11.8 million, compared with 9.4 million a year
earlier, according to researcher Autodata Corp., based in
Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. In August 2009, the pace was 14.2
million, aided by the federal subsidy for fuel-efficient models.  The month’s stronger sales, bolstered by  Ford Motor Co. ’s
41 percent gain, are a sign that the car market and the broader
economy may have bottomed out and that a slow, stable recovery
is under way, said  Jesse Toprak , vice president of industry
trends for Santa Monica, California-based TrueCar.com.  “It’s slightly better than expected, but it’s still a
stable and painful growth process,” Toprak said in an
interview. “This is another step in a healthy but rather slow
recovery. This month, there were no outside forces at play, like
government programs or crazy incentives, just the marketplace
trying to recover on its own.”  Deliveries at  General Motors Co. , the largest U.S.
automaker, climbed 11 percent from a year earlier to 173,155,
the Detroit-based company said today in a statement. Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford, the second-largest, reported 160,873 sales,
including more than doubling of deliveries of the Edge sport-
utility vehicle and Transit Connect van.  ‘Clunkers’ Ends  Industrywide deliveries in September were expected to reach
an 11.7 million rate, the average of nine analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Deliveries in all 2009 were 10.4 million,
the lowest since 1982.  The stronger month doesn’t indicate renewed acceleration in
economic growth, just that the economy has avoided a double-dip
recession, said  John Canally , an economist and investment
strategist at Boston-based LPL Financial Corp., which oversees
$276.9 billion in assets.  “We probably have put a floor under vehicle sales, but the
sparks you need to reaccelerate aren’t quite there yet,”
Canally said in an interview. “You don’t have robust job growth
or robust income growth. Your traditional catalysts for strong
consumer spending just aren’t in place yet.”  GM’s deliveries trailed three analysts’ average estimate
for a 13 percent gain. Chevrolet brand sales rose 18 percent to
121,479, helped by the Silverado pickup and Equinox SUV. Buick
deliveries gained 36 percent to 12,875, aided by the LaCrosse
sedan. GMC increased 42 percent to 25,995, and Cadillac rose
11 percent to 12,620.  ‘Willing to Spend’  “Consumers are willing to spend, albeit cautiously,”  Don Johnson , GM’s vice president of U.S. sales, said today on a
conference call with analysts.  GM’s sales of the Hummer, Pontiac and Saturn brands, which
were closed, and the Saab brand that it sold, fell to 186
vehicles from 14,982 vehicles in September 2009. GM’s four
remaining U.S. brands -- Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick --
rose a combined 22 percent in September.  Ford’s results topped six analysts’ average estimate for a
40 percent gain. The company’s namesake brand deliveries
increased 49 percent to 147,057 vehicles, while Lincoln gained
26 percent to 7,510 and the Mercury line, which is being
discontinued, rose 16 percent to 6,306.  Excluding the Volvo line, which Ford sold to China’s
Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., sales rose 46 percent. Volvo
was the largest automaker to report a sales decline, as
deliveries dropped 12 percent to 4,152.  Ford rose 2 cents to $12.26 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading , reversing a drop of as much as
1 percent. The shares have gained 23 percent this year.  Chrysler Sales  Chrysler Group LLC sales increased 61 percent to 100,077,
the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based company said in a statement.
That topped the 48 percent average estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Deliveries of its namesake brand rose 92 percent to 17,348,
helped by the Town & Country minivan and Sebring sedan. The
Dodge brand increased 71 percent to 36,272, Jeep rose 65 percent
to 28,603, and Ram gained 22 percent to 17,854.  “Chrysler is benefiting from stable gas prices and the
highly visible launch of the redesigned Grand Cherokee,” Ivan
Drury, an analyst for Santa Monica, California-based
Edmunds.com, said in an e-mailed statement today. “As long as
consumers are not worried about high fuel costs Chrysler should
be able to maintain a decent sales pace, since 71 percent of
Chrysler sales are trucks.”  Consumer Confidence  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
 consumer sentiment  fell to 68.2 last month from 68.9 in August.
The drop was smaller than analysts estimated, evidence that the
largest part of the economy may be stabilizing.  The gauge, released today, was projected to decline to 67,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists, and compares with a preliminary reading of
66.6 issued last month.  “We believe the economic recovery in the second half will
be slower than the first half,” GM’s Johnson said. “We do
expect modest employment growth.”  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s largest automaker, sold
147,162 Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles in September,
17 percent more than a year ago, the company said in an e-mailed
statement. The automaker’s deliveries were expected to gain
21 percent, the average estimate of four analysts.  Honda Sales  Honda Motor Co. , the second-largest Japanese carmaker, sold
97,361 Honda and Acura vehicles last month, up 26 percent from a
year ago, the company said in an e-mailed statement. The average
of four analysts’ estimates was for 32 percent increase.  Nissan Motor Co. , Japan’s third-largest automaker, sold
74,205 Nissan and Infiniti vehicles last month, up 34 percent
from a year earlier,  Al Castignetti , vice president of U.S.
sales, said in an interview. Car deliveries expanded 36 percent,
led by a 65 percent jump for Altima sedans, he said.  “This year has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride,”
Castignetti said. Sales should keep improving for the rest of
2010, particularly as light-truck demand remains strong, he
said.  Nissan was expected to boost sales 30 percent, the average
estimate of four analysts.  Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s largest automaker, boosted
sales 48 percent to 46,556 last month, led by increased
deliveries of Sonata sedans and Tucson sport-utility vehicle.
Retail sales to individual drivers, excluding those to rental
companies and business fleets, surged 73 percent, Hyundai’s U.S.
unit said.  Other Gainers  Volkswagen AG , Europe’s largest automaker, sold 28,249
Volkswagen, Audi, Bentley and Lamborghini vehicles, up
14 percent, according to Autodata.  Other automakers posting increases included Hyundai
affiliate Kia Motors Corp., 39 percent; Subaru, the auto brand
of Toyota-affiliated Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., 47 percent; and
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 5.3 percent, the researcher said.  BMW AG and  Daimler AG , Germany’s top luxury-car makers,
posted 21 percent sales increases, according to Autodata.  To contact the reporters on this story:
