Chile’s peso rose to a 27-month high
as the price of copper reached a two-year high.  The peso jumped 0.6 percent to 480.85 per dollar at 2:11
p.m. New York time, the strongest since June 5, 2008, from
483.55 yesterday. Its nine-day winning streak is the longest
since March 2008. The currency strengthened 1.2 percent this
week.  The price of copper, which rose for a third straight week,
reached a two-year high of $3.722 per pound for December
delivery after a report showed manufacturing accelerated in
China. Copper accounts for 56 percent of Chile’s exports and
China is the biggest buyer.  “The dollar is falling globally and copper keeps rising,
and the Chilean peso is highly correlated to copper,” said
 Flavio Magnasco , an economist at Banco Falabella in Santiago.
“The only thing that could stop this trend is central bank
intervention, and the market doesn’t expect that until 470 per
dollar, so we’ve got 10 pesos left to go.”  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
