SLC Agricola SA , a Brazilian farm
group, plans to create an agricultural-property company and sell
a stake to an investor this year, Chief Executive Officer
 Arlindo de Azevedo Moura  said.  SLC, whose crops cover an area almost as big as
Jacksonville, Florida, will seek to sell a 49 percent slice of
the new company, Land Co., to local or foreign investors that
may included sovereign and pension funds, he said today in an
interview in Sao Paulo. Porto Alegre, Brazil-based SLC would
retain control of the unit and contribute farmland.  “Agricultural land prices in Brazil have a tremendous
potential to increase,” said Moura, who declined to give a
possible value for the stake.  SLC Agricola  produces cotton, soybeans, coffee, corn and
rice on about 223,000 hectares (552,000 acres) in Brazil. The
company raised 308 million reais ($183 million) in an initial
public offering in June 2007.  Shares  fell 2 centavos, or 0.1 percent, to 18.64 reais at
2:11 p.m. New York time in Sao Paulo trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
