The spot price of emission credits in
New Zealand’s carbon market fell after low supply discouraged
bidding, Auckland-based broker OMFinancial Ltd. said today.  Carbon credits fell to NZ$19.75 ($14.56) a ton from NZ$20,
the broker said in an e-mailed statement. Companies in New
Zealand that emit greenhouse gases have the option to pay a tax
of NZ$25 a ton of emissions or buy carbon credits.  “Spot prices are moderating around the mid-to-high $19
level with emitters choosing not to bid a market that has no
volume,” according to the statement.  In New Zealand’s carbon trading system, credits are divided
into units backed by forests planted before 1990 and after, in
accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. The government is still
allocating units to farmers with pre-1990 forests, limiting
supply, the broker said last month.  The government has also issued carbon allowances to
fisheries that can also be traded. Those credits need to be
aggregated before they’re sold on the market, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
