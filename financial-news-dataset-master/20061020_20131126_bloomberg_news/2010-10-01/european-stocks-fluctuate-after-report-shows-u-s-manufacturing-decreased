European stocks fluctuated, with the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index poised for its biggest weekly fall in
three months, after a report showed U.S. manufacturing decreased
in September.  The Stoxx 600 slipped 0.1 percent to 259.47 at 3:10 p.m. in
London, after rising as much as 0.7 percent earlier today.  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index fell to
54.4 in September from 56.3 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said today. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
