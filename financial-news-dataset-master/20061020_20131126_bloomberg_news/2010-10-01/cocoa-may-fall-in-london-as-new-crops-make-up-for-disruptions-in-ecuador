Cocoa may fall in London as new crops
in the Ivory Coast and Ghana more than make up for any supply
disruptions because of fighting in Ecuador.  Ecuador’s security forces freed President  Rafael Correa  in
a raid on a hospital where police held him captive as part of
a wage dispute that regional leaders labeled an organized coup
attempt. Ecuador accounts for 4 percent of global cocoa
production, according to the International Cocoa Organization.  “On the whole” supplies globally are seen to be
“decent” on the back of West Africa’s main crop, said  Gary Mead , an analyst at VM Group in London. Prices may rise if the
violence in Ecuador “turns into a serious major disaster.”  Cocoa for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to 1,916
pounds ($3,027) a metric ton by 9:53 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
London. Prices have dropped 15 percent this year. White, or
refined, sugar dropped 1.1 percent to $610.30 a ton and robusta
coffee gained 0.8 percent to $1,735 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
