What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade after the U.S. government
yesterday said inventories from last year’s crop rose
unexpectedly, said  Terry Reilly , a market analyst for CitiGroup
Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. Dry weather also will aid
harvesting next week, boosting supplies, he said.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago after rain this week boosted soil moisture for planting
in Brazil and Argentina, Reilly said. Soybean-meal futures may
open $1.50 to $2.50 lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to open down 0.05 cent to 0.15 cent a pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as rains improve soil moisture for seeding in
Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan and dry weather aids harvesting
in Canada, Reilly said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
