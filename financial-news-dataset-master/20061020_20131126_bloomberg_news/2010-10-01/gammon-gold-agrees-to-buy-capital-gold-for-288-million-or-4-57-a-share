Gammon Gold Inc. , a Halifax, Nova
Scotia-based mining and exploration company, said it will
acquire  Capital Gold Corp.  in a cash-and-share transaction
valued at $288 million to gain properties in Mexico.  Capital Gold shareholders would receive 0.5209 of a Gammon
common share and 79 cents for each outstanding share, Gammon
said in a statement today. The deal values New York-based
Capital Gold at $4.57 a share based on Gammon’s closing price on
Sept. 24, the company said. That represents a 20 percent premium
on Capital shares based on their  closing price  that day.  Capital Gold’s board of directors rejected an offer made by
 Timmins Gold Corp.  on Aug. 31. Timmins, based in Vancouver,
offered C$4.50 ($4.40), or 2.27 Timmins shares, for each Capital
Gold share, Timmins said in a statement.  Capital Gold operates the El Chanate gold mine and the
Orion development in Mexico.  Gammon fell 18 cents, or 2.5 percent, to C$6.99 at
4:29 p.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have declined 40 percent this year. Capital Gold slid
4 cents, or 0.8 percent, to C$4.91, and has gained 28 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
