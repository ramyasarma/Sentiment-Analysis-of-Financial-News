RWE AG signed a contract to build an
18.7-megawatt biomass power plant in Sicily, the company said in
an e-mailed statement today. The plant will be held 90 percent
by RWE Innogy and partner Fri-El Green Power, with Italy’s
Infrastrutture e Gestioni S.p.A. holding the rest.  The plant, which has an investment volume of 61 million
euros, is scheduled to go into service in late 2012, according
to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
