Treasury  two-year yields touched a
record low as a report showed U.S. manufacturing growth slowed,
encouraging speculation that the central bank will increase
purchases of government debt.  U.S. notes rallied for a third consecutive week as Federal
Reserve Bank of New York President  William Dudley  said the
outlook for job growth and inflation is “unacceptable” and
that more monetary easing is probably needed to spur growth and
avert deflation.  “It’s all about the Fed,” said  Richard Bryant , senior
vice president for fixed income in New York at MF Global
Holdings Ltd., a broker of exchange-traded futures. “The Fed
has communicated its intent to reflate our way out of the
current environment. That has allowed yields to remain at these
historically low levels.”  The benchmark 10-year  note  yield was little changed at 2.51
percent at 4:15 p.m. in New York, according to BGCantor Market
Data. The price of the 2.625 percent security maturing in August
2020 was 100 31/32. The two-year note  yield  was 0.41 percent
after falling to the record low of 0.4066 percent.  U.S. debt yields fluctuated with stocks. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.4 percent after falling 0.2 percent.
Crude oil climbed 2.1 percent to $81.65 a barrel.  The  yield  on the 10-year note dropped 10 basis points this
week, while the 30-year bond yield slid 8 basis points to 3.71
percent. The 2-year yield has decreased 3 basis points.  Flatter Yield Curve  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year securities
over 2-year debt narrowed 0.07 percentage point this week to
2.09 percentage points as investors speculated the Fed will step
up quantitative easing. The spread touched a four-week low of
2.03 percentage points on Sept. 28 on a closing basis.  Dudley said in a New York speech that the central bank has
“tools that can provide additional stimulus at costs that do
not appear to be prohibitive.”  He said that $500 billion of asset purchases, for example,
would add as much stimulus as reducing the Fed’s benchmark rate
0.5 percentage point to 0.75 percentage point, depending on how
long investors expect the Fed to hold the assets. The Federal
Open Market Committee next meets Nov. 2-3.  The central bank completed a program to buy $1.25 trillion
of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of
agency debt in March. The Fed was the biggest buyer of
Treasuries when it purchased $300 billion of U.S. debt in 2009.  Bernanke’s View  While other central bank officials voiced a range of views
in speeches this week, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
yesterday at a Washington forum with teachers that the central
bank has a duty to aid the U.S. economy as the jobless rate
holds near 10 percent.  “The market has tethered itself to the whims of the Fed,”
 James Caron , head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at Morgan
Stanley in New York, wrote in a note to clients. “Whether or
not they engage in QE, how much and for how long are virtual
uncertainties that are driving risk dynamics.” The firm is one
of 18 primary dealers that trade directly with the central bank.  The Fed said in its statement following its Sept. 21
meeting that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation
if needed to support economic recovery and to return inflation,
over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”  Consumer prices excluding food and energy increased in
August for a fifth month at an annual rate of 0.9 percent,
matching the slowest year-over-year rate of gains since 1966,
the Labor Department said Sept. 17. The unemployment rate
increased to 9.6 percent from 9.5 percent, the Labor Department
reported Sept. 3.  Fed Debt Buying  The Fed retained last week its stance from its Aug. 10
meeting of keeping its portfolio of securities stable at about
$2 trillion to keep money from draining out of the financial
system. The central bank bought $2.2 billion of Treasuries
maturing from August 2021 to February 2040 yesterday, increasing
the total purchased since Aug. 17 to $36.812 billion.  Bonds pared losses as the Tempe, Arizona-based Institute
for Supply Management’s factory index dropped in September to
54.4, the lowest level since November 2009. Readings greater
than 50 signal growth. Measures of orders and production fell to
the lowest level since June 2009.  “The data is telling us the economy is growing, but
growing very weakly,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury
trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. “It’s becoming
clearer every day that QE II is going to be done.”  Treasuries dropped earlier today as reports showed China’s
manufacturing grew at the fastest pace in four months and
consumer spending in the U.S. increased more than forecast.  U.S. debt returned 2.7 percent in the third quarter and is
up 8.8 percent this year, according to a Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index. Group of Seven debt advanced 2.2 percent from July
through September and has gained 6.5 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
