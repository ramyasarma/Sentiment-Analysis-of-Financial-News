Portsmouth Miniatures Studio, which
was involved in the filming of the movies ‘King Kong’ and ‘The
Lord of the Rings’ trilogy, has been hit by fire, the New
Zealand Herald newspaper reported on its website.  No one was hurt and about a dozen fire engines were sent to
the building in Wellington’s eastern suburbs, the newspaper said,
citing studio, police and fire department spokespeople.  The facility is part of Oscar-winning director  Peter Jackson ’s studios in Wellington and was used to shot miniatures
and special effects for ‘King Kong’ and ‘The Lord of the Rings’
movie series, according to FilmWellington, a  website  promoting
filming locations and services in New Zealand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
