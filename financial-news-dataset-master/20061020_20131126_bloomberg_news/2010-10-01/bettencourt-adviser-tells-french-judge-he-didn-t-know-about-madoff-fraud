L’Oreal SA  heiress  Liliane Bettencourt ’s financial adviser told a judge looking into French
losses in  Bernard Madoff ’s Ponzi scheme that he had no knowledge
that Madoff’s fund was a fraud.  Patrice de Maistre  met yesterday in Paris with the judge
leading the probe, at the request of a lawyer for other Madoff
victims, said Pascal Wilhelm, de Maistre’s lawyer. De Maistre
was asked about the whether he suspected Madoff’s scheme when he
recommended, almost five years before Madoff’s crime was
exposed, the liquidation of a fund Bettencourt had invested in.  De Maistre told the judge,  Renaud van Ruymbeke , that if he
“thought it was fishy” he wouldn’t “have advised reinvesting
right away in” another Madoff fund, Wilhelm said in a telephone
interview today.  Bettencourt, Europe’s richest woman, lost about 30 million
euros ($41 million) of the 40 million euros she placed in the
 LuxAlpha Sicav-American Selection  fund after an earlier fund,
Oreades, was liquidated in 2004. French investors overall may
have lost as much as 500 million euros through funds dissolved
after Madoff’s fraud was uncovered, according to France’s market
regulator.  The judge will question de Maistre’s predecessors and those
involved in the creation of Oreades next, Wilhelm said.  Madoff pleaded guilty in March 2009 to orchestrating the
biggest Ponzi scheme in history. He was sentenced to 150 years
in a federal prison in North Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
