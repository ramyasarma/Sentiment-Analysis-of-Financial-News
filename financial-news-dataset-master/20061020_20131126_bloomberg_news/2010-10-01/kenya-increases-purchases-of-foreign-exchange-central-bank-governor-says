Kenya’s central bank  increased
purchases of foreign exchange “in the past couple of weeks” to
boost reserves, Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said. He didn’t say how
much they had bought.  The purchases were aimed at fulfilling mandatory reserve
requirements and the government’s external obligations, Ndung’u
told reporters today in the capital, Nairobi. They are not
trying to change the exchange rate, he said.  Foreign exchange reserves are “slightly” over the
statutory requirement of four months of import cover and aligned
with targets, according to a central bank statement on Sept. 28.
The press has “misrepresented” the bank by saying its
purchases of dollars and euros over the past two months were
meant to support a particular exchange rate, it said.  Kenya’s shilling weakened as much as 1 percent to 81.55 per
dollar and traded 0.1 percent lower at 80.80 by 3:17 p.m. in
Nairobi, from a previous close of 80.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
