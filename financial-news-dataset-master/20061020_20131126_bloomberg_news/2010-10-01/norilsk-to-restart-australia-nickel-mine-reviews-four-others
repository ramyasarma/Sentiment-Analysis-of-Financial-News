OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , the world’s
biggest producer, aims to restart one of its mines in Australia
early next year and is reviewing four other mothballed as prices
rebound for the metal used to rustproof steel.  Norilsk will resume production at the Lake Johnston mine,
Dmitry Kondratyev, senior manager of business development at the
Moscow-based company, said in a phone interview from Perth. Lake
Johnston, in Western Australia, yielded 8,900 metric tons of
nickel concentrate in 2008, its last full year of operation.  Nickel futures on the London Metal Exchange have risen 27
percent this year as manufacturing in China increased. Norilsk,
which acquired Lake Johnston and other Australian mines through
the $6.4 billion takeover of  LionOre Mining International Ltd. 
in 2007, closed its Australian operations in the next two years
as prices plummeted and mining costs rose.  Norilsk plans to appoint at least two managers and a
geologist for Lake Johnston, according to advertisements in the
Australian media.  The company in July appointed  Edwin Hans van Leeuwen  as
managing director for its Australian unit, according to the
Norilsk website. Leeuwen, a former employee at BHP Billiton Ltd.,
was hired to investigate “possible development options for the
Australian assets,” the website said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
