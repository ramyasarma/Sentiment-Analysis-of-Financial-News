The rand strengthened against the
dollar, posting a sixth week of gains, as a jump in China’s
 manufacturing  boosted investor appetite for risk, overshadowing
a South African report that showed factory output contracted.  The currency appreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 6.9254
per dollar and traded 0.5 percent higher to 6.9475 per dollar at
4:36 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of 6.9830. The
rand has rallied 1 percent in the past five days, extending the
longest streak of weekly advances since September 2009.  China’s purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.8 in
September, the fastest in four months, from 51.7 in August, the
country’s logistics federation and statistics bureau said in an
e-mailed statement. PMI readings above 50 indicate expansions in
manufacturing while those below 50 show a contraction.  “Chinese data boosted the appetite for risk helping the
high-yielding commodity currencies remain in favor,” said  Marc Copeland , a Cape Town-based trader at Investec Capital Markets.  South Africa’s  PMI  dropped below 50 last month as strikes
in the car industry curbed manufacturing,  Kagiso Securities Ltd. 
said in an e-mailed statement today. The seasonally adjusted
index slid to 48.4 from 50.3 in August, lower than the 50.8
reading predicted in a Bloomberg  survey .  Government bonds declined for a fourth day, with the
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 falling 5
cents to 125.16 rand. The yield rose by 1 basis point to 7.34
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
