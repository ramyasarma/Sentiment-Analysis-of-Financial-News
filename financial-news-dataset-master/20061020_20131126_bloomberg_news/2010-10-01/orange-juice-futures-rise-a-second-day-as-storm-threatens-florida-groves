Orange juice rose for the second day
on concern that a storm system looming in the Atlantic Ocean may
intensify and damage citrus groves in Florida, the world’s
largest grower after Brazil.  The area of disorganized thunderstorms has a 40 percent
chance of becoming a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane
Center said in a  statement  at 8 a.m. Miami time. Hurricane
season in the Atlantic began June 1 and ends Nov. 30.  This low-pressure system will keep the market supported
above $1.50 a pound, said  Fain Shaffer , the president of
Infinity Trading Corp., a commodities brokerage in Medford,
Oregon. If it becomes a hurricane, it could be “very serious,”
he said.  Orange juice for November delivery climbed 0.7 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $1.5765 a pound at 12:10 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. The price was down 0.3 percent for the week. Before
today, the commodity surged 72 percent in the past year.
Yesterday, the commodity climbed 3.1 percent on storm concerns.  “It would need to be a strong tropical storm to cause a
real problem with fruit droppage,” said  Drew Lerner , the
president of World Weather Inc. in Overland Park, Kansas. Winds
up to 40 mph shouldn’t pose a threat to the crop, he said.  Florida’s orange harvest typically starts in the first or
second week of October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
