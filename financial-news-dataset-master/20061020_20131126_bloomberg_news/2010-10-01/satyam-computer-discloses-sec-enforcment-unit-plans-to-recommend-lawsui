Satyam Computer Services Ltd.,
embroiled in India’s biggest corporate fraud probe, disclosed
that it received a so-called Wells Notice from U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission staff in September 2009.  The disclosure, included in part of its audited annual
financial statements dated Sept. 29, indicated that the SEC
enforcement division would recommend the filing of a civil suit
against Satyam related to the disclosure of financial
irregularities by the company’s chairman earlier that year.  To date, the SEC has not made a determination as whether or
not to file a suit, Satyam said.  Satyam is facing investigations after former Chairman
Ramalinga Raju disclosed in January 2009 he overstated assets by
more than $1 billion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
