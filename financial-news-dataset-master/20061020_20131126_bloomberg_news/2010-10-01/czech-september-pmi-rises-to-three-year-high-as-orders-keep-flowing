Czech September manufacturing rose at
the fastest pace in three years as new orders increased from
both domestic and foreign customers, an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI was 58, the
highest since August 2007, compared with 57.3 in August, the
bank said today in an e-mailed report. A reading greater than 50
signals an improvement in overall conditions.  The Czech economy, where exports including cars made by
Skoda Auto AS account for about 70 percent of output, last year
emerged from its worst recession since the end of communism in
1989. Gross domestic product expanded an annual 2.4 percent in
the three months through June, the fastest pace in eight
quarters.  “New orders rose for the 14th successive month in
September, and as a marked rate,” the bank said in the report,
compiled by Markit. “Firms reported that both domestic and
export markets had contributed to the improving outlook.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
