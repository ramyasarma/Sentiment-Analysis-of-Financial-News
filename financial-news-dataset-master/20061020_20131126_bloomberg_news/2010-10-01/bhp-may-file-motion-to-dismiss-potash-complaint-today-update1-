BHP Billiton Ltd. , pursuing a $40
billion hostile bid for  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. , will
likely submit a filing to a U.S. court today asking it to
dismiss a complaint by the world’s largest fertilizer maker.  The motion will probably be filed to the U.S. District
Court in Chicago today, Ruban Yogarajah, a London-based
spokesman for BHP, said by telephone.  Potash Corp. sued BHP on Sept. 22, alleging that the
company’s executives had made misleading public statements to
drive down Potash Corp.’s share value, increasing the likelihood
of a successful bid. Melbourne-based BHP, the world’s biggest
mining company, bid $130 a share for Potash Corp. in August and
its offer is open until Nov. 18.  U.S. District Judge  David Coar  on Sept. 27 rejected a
request from BHP that he stay the exchange of evidence in the
case until ruling on a separate application by the company to
throw out the case. The judge said he would take no action
related to a dismissal motion until it was filed with the court.  Potash Corp., based in Saskatoon, Canada, is using the
lawsuit to gain confidential information, BHP alleged in papers
filed Sept. 24. Potash Corp.’s demands for large quantities of
documents are “burdensome” and a “fishing expedition” and
the company waited too long to make the request, BHP said.  The case is Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan v. BHP Billiton,
10-06024, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
