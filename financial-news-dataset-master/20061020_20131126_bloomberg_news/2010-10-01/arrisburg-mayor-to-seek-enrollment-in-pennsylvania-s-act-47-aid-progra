 Harrisburg Mayor Linda Thompson
asked Pennsylvania to determine the city to be in municipal
financial distress so it would qualify for help and oversight
under the state’s Act 47 program.  The city “stands on the precipice of full-blown financial
crisis as a looming cash shortfall threatens its ability to pay
vendors and meet payroll,” a statement from the mayor’s office
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
