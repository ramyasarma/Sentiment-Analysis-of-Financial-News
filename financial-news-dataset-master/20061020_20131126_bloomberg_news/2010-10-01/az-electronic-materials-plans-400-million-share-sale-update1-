AZ Electronic Materials Group, which
makes chemical materials used in flat-panel displays, said it is
planning a $400 million initial public offering to pay debt and
seek new markets in Asia and elsewhere.  AZ, owned by management and funds affiliated with Carlyle
Group and Vestar Capital Partners, will seek a listing on the
London Stock Exchange, the company said today in a statement
distributed by the Regulatory News Service.  AZ was once part of Hoechst AG, a German company now part
of Sanofi-Aventis, the company said. It will list securities
through a Luxembourg holding company, AZ said.  “The proposed IPO will provide added impetus to the
development of the company, enabling AZ to pursue new business
opportunities in large and potentially high-growth markets that
leverage our existing expertise and capabilities,” Chief
Executive Officer Geoff Wild said in the statement.  UBS Investment Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche
Bank AG are acting as joint sponsors, joint global co-ordinators
and joint bookrunners, the company said. Collins Stewart Plc and
Société Générale are acting as co-lead managers. Rothschild is
acting as financial adviser to AZ and the shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
