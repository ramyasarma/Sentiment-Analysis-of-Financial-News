Japan’s Defense Minister Toshimi
Kitazawa said today he will seek a meeting with his Chinese
counterpart at a regional security forum later this month, Kyodo
News reported.  China hasn’t responded to the request, Kitazawa told
reporters in Tokyo, Kyodo said. Defense ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations are due to meet with
counterparts from Japan, China, the U.S. and several other
countries in Hanoi on Oct. 12.  Relations between China and Japan deteriorated last month
after a collision in disputed waters involving a Chinese fishing
boat and two Japanese Coast Guard vessels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
