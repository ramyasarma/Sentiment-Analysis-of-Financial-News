Natural rubber imports by India, the
fourth-biggest producer, surged 54 percent in September as tire
makers increased purchases, the state-owned  Rubber Board  said.  Incoming shipments jumped to 28,720 metric ton from 18,612
tons a year ago, the board said today. Purchases in the April-
September period declined 12 percent to 107,190, it said.  India’s passenger car sales rose to a record for a second
straight month in August as economic growth and new models from
Nissan Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG stoked demand.  Bridgestone
Corp.  said in March it will spend 50 billion yen on a second
plant in the country, joining local rivals  Apollo Tyres Ltd.  and
 Ceat Ltd.  in adding capacity.  Rubber production last month climbed 4.3 percent to 77,500
tons after farmers increased tapping to benefit from high prices,
the board said. Output in the nine months ended Sept. 30 added
7.6 percent to 375,250 tons, it said.  Demand in April to September expanded 2 percent to 465,550
tons as tire makers boosted output and exports, the board said.
Stockpiles at the end of last month totaled 268,065 tons, 28
percent more than a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
