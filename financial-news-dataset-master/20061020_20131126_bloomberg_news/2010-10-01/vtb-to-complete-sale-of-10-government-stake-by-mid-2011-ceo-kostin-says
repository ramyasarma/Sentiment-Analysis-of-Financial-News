VTB Group , Russia’s second-biggest
lender, “definitely” plans to conclude the sale of a 10
percent government stake by mid-2011, Chief Executive Officer
 Andrei Kostin  said.  A “group of investors” is seeking to buy the stake,
Kostin told reporters today in Yalta, Ukraine. Selling the
entire stake to TPG Capital, as some media outlets have
reported, is “out of question,” he said.  The government boosted its stake in VTB to 85.5 percent
from 77.5 percent in September 2009 by acquiring shares for 180
billion rubles ($5.9 billion) as part of a program to stabilize
the financial industry. Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said
Sept. 8 that the state may sell part of its holding as early as
this year. The government targets a premium of as much as 67
percent on the purchase price, according to Kudrin.  TPG, a global private-equity investor, is in talks to
acquire a 10 percent stake in the lender, the Moscow-based
newspaper Kommersant reported last month.  Russia may raise 890.5 billion rubles from asset sales in
2010-2013 to help finance the budget deficit, including 298
billion rubles in 2011, according to the Finance Ministry. The
ministry has proposed selling stakes in companies including VTB,
OAO Rosneft and OAO Sberbank.  State asset sales will cover 16 percent to 17 percent of
the government’s budget deficit in the next three years,
compared with 0.3 percent this year, Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  said Sept. 23.  VTB’s privatization “makes sense” as long as the
government retains control, Kudrin said in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
