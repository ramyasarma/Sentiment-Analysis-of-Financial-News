Leicester City fired manager Paulo
Sousa after the club won just one of its first nine matches and
sits in last place in the second division of English soccer.  The former player on the Portugal national team was hired
in July to replace Nigel Pearson. Goalkeeper coach Mike Stowell
and coach Chris Powell will take temporary charge while the team
looks for a new manager, Leicester said today on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
