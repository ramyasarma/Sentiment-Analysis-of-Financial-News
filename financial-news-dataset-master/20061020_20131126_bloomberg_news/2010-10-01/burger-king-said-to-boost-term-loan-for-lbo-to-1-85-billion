Burger King Holdings Inc. ’s $1.85
billion term loan to finance its buyout by 3G Capital rose in
its first trade, according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  The six-year debt, sold to investors at 99 cents on the
dollar, first changed hands at 100.625 cents then climbed to 101
cents, said the person, who declined to be identified because
the trades are private.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc arranged the
financing, which has an interest rate of 4.5 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate and a 1.75 percent
Libor floor, the person said. Libor is the rate banks charge to
lend to each other.  The transaction for the second-largest U.S. hamburger chain
includes a 250 million euro ($348 million) term loan that
climbed to 101 cents on the euro today, said another person
familiar with the trades. The debt, sold to investors at 99
cents, pays 4.75 percentage points more than Euribor, with a
1.75 percent floor on the lending benchmark.  Lenders to both loans got a one-year soft-call protection
of 101 cents, the person said, meaning the Miami-based company
would have to pay a 1 cent premium over face value to refinance
the debt during its first year.  Susan Robison, a spokeswoman for Burger King, wasn’t
immediately available to comment. Steve Lipin, a spokesman for
3G, didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  McDonald’s Corp.  is the biggest U.S. hamburger chain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
