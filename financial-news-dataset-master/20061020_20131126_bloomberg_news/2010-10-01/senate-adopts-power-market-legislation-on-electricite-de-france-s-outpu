The French Senate adopted legislation
designed to open the French power market by forcing Electricite
de France SA to sell nuclear power output to competitors.  Following debate on hundreds of amendments to the law,
which has already been passed by the National Assembly, the
Senate yesterday adopted the text, according to a transcript
available on the Paris-based body’s website.  It will now return to the National Assembly for a final
vote before it can become law. The price at which  EDF  will sell
power will be fixed by subsequent government decrees.  The European Commission is “impatient” for the power
legislation to go into effect, Marie-Christine Jalabert, deputy
head of the gas and power markets unit at Europe’s executive
body, said at an energy conference in Paris this week.  GDF Suez SA Chief Executive Officer  Gerard Mestrallet  said
at the same conference that the price for the power needs to be
low enough to promote competition for residential customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
