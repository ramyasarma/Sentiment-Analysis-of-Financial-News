ArborGen Inc., the U.S. developer of
genetically modified forest trees, plans to raise as much as $75
million in an initial public offering of common shares to pay
for facility upgrades and research.  ArborGen, a joint venture of U.S. companies  International
Paper Co.  and  MeadWestvaco Corp.  and New Zealand’s  Rubicon Ltd. ,
will use the proceeds to buy a new headquarters, manufacturing
plants and research laboratories, and to repay debt, the
Summerville, South Carolina-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. The price and exact size of the offering
haven’t been determined.  ArborGen, the world’s largest seller of conventional
seedlings for forestry, is developing freeze-tolerant eucalyptus
trees for the U.S. South. The company said in the filing it had
sales of $21.6 million in the year ended March 31 and long-term
debt of $12.8 million as of June 30.  ArborGen said it plans to produce modified trees for the
paper industry in much the same way  Monsanto Co.  provides
genetically modified crops to agriculture.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are acting as
joint book runners for the offering, ArborGen said in the
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
