Millions of welfare claimants will
see their benefit payments eliminated in favor of a single
“universal credit” program that Work and Pensions Secretary
Iain Duncan Smith says will save 9 billion pounds ($14 billion)
a year, the London-based Times reported.  Such benefits as housing subsidies, income support and
dozens of other welfare payments will be scrapped, the Times
said without saying where it got the information.  Smith predicts the savings will result from lower
administration costs and a reduction in fraud, the newspaper
said. The new program will guarantee that a person with a job
will be better off than someone only on welfare, as benefits
claimants will be permitted to keep more of their payments when
they take a job or increase their hours, the Times said.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
