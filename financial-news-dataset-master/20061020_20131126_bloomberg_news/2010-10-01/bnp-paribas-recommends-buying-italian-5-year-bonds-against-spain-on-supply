Investors should buy Italian five-
year government bonds and sell similar-maturity Spanish
securities, because Spain has more debt left to sell this year,
BNP Paribas SA said.  “Spain has yet to issue 24 percent of its 2010 total
supply in the fourth quarter, but Italy only 12 percent,” BNP
Paribas fixed-income analysts wrote today in a research note.  The  yield premium  investors demand to hold the Spanish
notes instead of Italian securities was little changed at 29
basis points as of 8:52 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
