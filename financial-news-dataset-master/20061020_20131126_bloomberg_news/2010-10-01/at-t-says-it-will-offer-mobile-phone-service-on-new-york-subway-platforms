AT&T Inc.  and T-Mobile USA customers
will have mobile-phone service on New York City subway stations
after the carriers signed 10-year agreements to access an
underground network being built by   Transit Wireless LLC .  AT&T, the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier, and
Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile will have the option to renew the
contracts four times in increments of five years each, said  Pat Smith , a spokesman for closely held Transit Wireless.  Transit Wireless said in July it secured new financing to
build the network for New York’s 277 underground subway
stations. The deal rejuvenated a plan that had been delayed for
about three years.  An announcement on the agreements may come as soon as next
week, Smith said.  AT&T, based in Dallas, rose 21 cents to $28.81 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have added
2.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
