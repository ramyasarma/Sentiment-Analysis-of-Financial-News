Swiss stocks declined, as the shares
of Swatch Group AG, Cie. Financiere Richemont SA and Julius Baer
Group Ltd. retreated.  The benchmark Swiss Market Index dropped 0.4 percent to
6,270.38 at 4:36 p.m in Zurich after earlier swinging between
gains and losses at least 15 times.  Swatch decreased 4.3 percent to 354 Swiss francs after the
luxury-goods maker’s chief executive officer said that the
weakening U.S. dollar will reduce net income.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
