An Austrian man held in connection
with the theft of Swiss bank-account details and their sale to
Germany is believed to have killed himself in prison.  Guards at a regional jail in the Swiss capital of Bern
discovered the 42-year-old man dead in his cell on Sept. 29 as
they came to bring him breakfast, the Swiss federal prosecutor’s
office said in an e-mailed statement. He had been detained since
mid-September on suspicion of economic espionage, it said.  The suspect, who wasn’t identified, was held in an
investigation into the alleged theft of client data from Swiss
banks, which were subsequently sold to German tax investigators,
prosecution spokeswoman Jeanette Balmer said today by e-mail.
Officials in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said in
August they were using information from an informant to identify
possible tax dodgers who stashed funds in Switzerland.  “As far as could be determined so far, no third party was
involved,” the prosecutor’s statement said. “A suicide seems
likely.”  The suspect was an Austrian national, Austria’s foreign
ministry spokesman, Harald Stranzl, said by telephone from the
capital, Vienna.  The man, a native of the Tyrol region of Austria who lived
in the Swiss town of Winterthur, sold information on 2,000
account holders of a Swiss bank to the German tax authorities,
the Vienna-based Krone newspaper reported, citing unidentified
Swiss and German secret-service officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
