U.S. stocks rose, adding to the
biggest September  rally  since 1939, while oil climbed and copper
surged to a two-year high as American consumer spending and
confidence topped estimates and Chinese manufacturing
accelerated. The Dollar Index slid to a nine-month low.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6 percent to
1,147.42 at 10:12 a.m. in New York. The  S&P GSCI index  of 24
commodities climbed 0.7 percent to a five-month high and crude
oil traded above $81 a barrel for the first time in almost two
months. The Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against six
major trading partners, declined as much as 0.7 percent to
78.147 and gold returned to a record. The 10-year Treasury yield
pared gains, increasing 2 basis points to 2.53 percent.  U.S. government data showing 0.4 percent growth in consumer
spending and higher incomes reinforced the Federal Reserve’s
forecast that the world’s largest economy will keep expanding at
a “modest” pace.  China’s manufacturing  expanded at the fastest
rate in four months in September, adding to signs that economic
growth in the world’s biggest energy consumer is stabilizing.  “The economy is righting itself from a speed bump,” said
Joseph Keating, chief investment officer at CenterState Bank
Wealth Management, who manages $2 billion in Birmingham,
Alabama. “It’s a little better than the pause the consumer
sector took in the April through July period. In essence, we’re
simply going back to a slow growth recovery mode.”  September Rally  All 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 advanced last month,
sending the index to an 8.8 percent September rally and erasing
a 2010 loss that swelled to 8.3 percent in July, amid
speculation the world’s largest economy will avoid slipping back
into a recession and bets that the Fed will buy more debt to
support the recovery.  Commodity producers and financial companies led gains
today, with Exxon Mobil Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. pacing
the advance.  Benchmark U.S. indexes trimmed gains after the Institute
for Supply Management’s factory index fell to 54.4 in September
and its gauge of prices unexpectedly climbed to 70.5, topping
the median economist forecast for a reading of 59 and damping
speculation that the Fed will need to buy bonds to combat
possible deflation.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.7 percent for a fifth
consecutive weekly advance. Chinese markets were closed today
for a holiday.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  advanced 0.9 percent to the
highest level since June 2008.  The euro strengthened 0.7 percent against the dollar and
0.6 percent versus the yen.  Copper for delivery in December added 5.4 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.7050 a pound and touched $3.72, the highest level
since July 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
