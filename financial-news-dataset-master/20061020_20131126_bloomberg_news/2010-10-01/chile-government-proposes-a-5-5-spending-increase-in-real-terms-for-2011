Chile’s government submitted a 2011
budget proposal to Congress today that calls for an increase in
public spending of 5.5 percent when taking inflation into
account.  President  Sebastian Pinera ’s government has proposed $53.4
billion in spending next year, Finance Minister  Felipe Larrain 
said in a televised address. Government outlays are set to rise
9 percent this year after increasing more than 18 percent in
2009.  The spending plan, Pinera’s first as president, aims to
help alleviate poverty and rebuild a swathe of the country
devastated in a Feb. 27 earthquake, Larrain said. The government
wants to increase spending by a rate that wouldn’t distort the
exchange rate or increase the fiscal deficit, he said.  “This is a responsible budget that protects key economic
variables that affect the lives of Chileans, like the exchange
rate, the interest rate and inflation,” he said in prepared
remarks. “It also puts us back on the path of returning to a
structural fiscal equilibrium.”  Chile’s peso has gained 12 percent in the past three months
against the dollar, the most among Latin American currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Larrain didn’t give an estimate for the fiscal deficit next
year. This year, Pinera inherited a fiscal deficit equivalent to
3.1 percent of gross domestic product under a new methodology of
calculating budgets. The administration plans to shrink the
deficit to 1 percent of GDP in its four years in office, Larrain
said Aug. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
