U.S. Steel Corp. , the second-largest
U.S. maker of the metal, is closing blast-furnace and
steelmaking operations at its Hamilton Works facility in Canada
because of decreased demand.  “We continue to review and analyze market conditions and
the impact they’ve had on customer orders,” Trevor Harris, a
spokesman for  U.S. Steel Canada , a subsidiary of Pittsburgh-
based U.S. Steel, said in a phone interview. “We can’t
speculate on when market conditions will improve enough to
necessitate restarting the facility.”  Harris, speaking from Hamilton, Ontario, said he couldn’t
comment on the levels of production that might be affected by
the shutdown. The company isn’t announcing workforce reductions,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
