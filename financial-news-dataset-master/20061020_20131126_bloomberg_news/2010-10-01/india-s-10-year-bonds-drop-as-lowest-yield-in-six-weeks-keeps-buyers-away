India’s 10-year  bonds  dropped for the
first time in nine days on speculation the lowest yield in six
weeks was deterring investors from buying the securities.  The notes were headed for a weekly decline as the overnight
 call money rate  approached a six-month high, reflecting tight
liquidity and making it more expensive to buy debt using loans.
Banks  borrowed  an average 251 billion rupees ($5.6 billion) each
day from the central bank’s repurchase auction window last month
as companies paid advance taxes. In August, banks borrowed an
average 11 billion rupees, according to central bank data.  “To some extent there is profit-taking,” said Killol
Pandya, who manages the equivalent of $135 million in debt funds
at Shinsei Asset Management Pvt. in Mumbai. “I don’t think the
central bank is interested in easing liquidity any time soon as
keeping it tight helps fight inflation and makes the monetary
policy more effective.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 rose three
basis points to 7.88 percent as of 9:41 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.19, or 19 paise per 100 rupee face amount to 99.49.  The
market was closed yesterday.  The central bank boosted interest rates for the fifth time
this year on Sept. 17. The  repurchase auction rate , at which it
lends to banks, is 6 percent.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased to the highest level since October 2008. The rate, a
fixed payment made to receive floating rates, rose four basis
points to 6.52 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
