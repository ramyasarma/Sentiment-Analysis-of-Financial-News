Ryder Cup officials have changed the
schedule to try to finish the golf event on time after rain
stopped play for more than seven hours today.  The new schedule, made in consultation with captains  Corey Pavin  of the U.S. and  Colin Montgomerie  of Europe, would allow
the competition to end as scheduled in two days at Celtic Manor
in Newport, Wales, weather permitting.  This morning’s four fourball matches resumed after the
delay at 5 p.m. Any which do not finish tonight will restart
tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  The second session will now consist of six foursome
matches, which officials hope to start mid-morning tomorrow. The
third session, which is hoped to start Sunday morning, calls for
two foursomes and four four-balls.  The final 12 singles matches are also scheduled for Sunday
as planned. If necessary, play will continue into Monday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
