The Czech Republic’s central state
budget deficit widened 14 percent in the first nine months
compared with the previous year when the government used a
portion of state reserves to boost revenue.  The shortfall was 99.6 billion koruna ($5.6 billion) at the
end of September, compared with 78.7 billion koruna at the end
of August, the Prague-based Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. The result represents about 61 percent of the
full-year target of 163 billion koruna. The deficit stood at
87.3 billion koruna in the first nine months of 2009.  The east European country is seeking to cut its fiscal
deficit, which widened to a revised 5.8 percent of gross
domestic product in 2009, almost twice the European Union limit.
Even as state finances are set to benefit from an economic
recovery after last year’s  recession , the new government formed
after May elections froze spending to meet the 2010 target of
5.3 percent.  Revenue totaled 745.9 billion koruna at the end of
September, up 19.2 billion koruna from last year when it was
boosted by a 32 billion-koruna transfer of state reserves to the
budget, the ministry said. Expenditures increased 31.4 billion
koruna to 845.5 billion koruna at the end of September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
