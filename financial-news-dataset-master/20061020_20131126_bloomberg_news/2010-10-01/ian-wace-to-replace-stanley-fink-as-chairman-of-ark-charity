Ian Wace , founder of London-based
hedge fund firm Marshall Wace LLP, was named chairman of
 Absolute Return for Kids , the charity started by fellow money
manager  Arpad Busson .  Wace will replace  Stanley Fink , chief executive officer of
International Standard Asset Management and former head of
London-based Man Group Plc, ARK said in an e-mailed statement
today. Fink was named chairman in July 2009.  “Stanley has been an outstanding chairman, and I’m glad he
will continue as a highly regarded trustee,” Wace said. “I
understand why the huge demands on his time have necessitated
this standing down.”  ARK aims to improve the lives of children across the world.
It has set up programs including medical treatment for HIV/AIDS
sufferers in sub-Saharan Africa, helping orphans in Romania, and
offering education and training to U.K. kids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
