Plains All American Pipeline LP 
bought a 34 percent share in a pipeline that carries oil from
Colorado to Oklahoma, as SemGroup Corp. cut its holdings in the
crude-transport system by almost half.  The White Cliffs Pipeline LLC purchase was part of about
$175 million in asset buys Houston-based Plains announced today.
The company also bought 11 percent of the Capline pipeline,
making it majority owner, from a subsidiary of London-based  BP
Plc . The 633-mile (1,018-kilometer) pipeline from Louisiana to
Illinois is capable of moving 1.1 million barrels a day.  SemGroup’s subsidiary sold shares of White Cliffs to units
of Noble Energy Inc. and Western Gas Partners LP for $141
million, according to a statement today. Noble and Western Gas,
which is controlled by Anadarko Petroleum Corp., sold some of
those shares to a subsidiary of Plains All American.  SemGroup  said it will use the $141 million from the sale of
White Cliffs shares to repay debt. After the sale, SemGroup will
own 51 percent of White Cliffs, down from 99 percent. Western
Gas will have a 10 percent share and Noble Energy 5 percent.  The 526-mile White Cliffs pipeline, which began operating
last year, provides producers in Colorado with access to the
Cushing, Oklahoma, market and refiners in the Midwest, according
to Tulsa, Oklahoma-based SemGroup.  Cushing is an oil storage point and the delivery point for
crude contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
White Cliffs pipeline is capable of moving 30,000 barrels a day,
with the ability to expand to 70,000 barrels, Plains said.  Anadarko Petroleum, based in The Woodlands, Texas, has a
stake in Western Gas through ownership of its general partner,
Western Gas Holdings LLC.  Noble Energy, based in Houston, has more than 800,000 net
acres and is currently producing the equivalent of 55,000
barrels of oil a day in Colorado’s central DJ Basin, said  David Larson , a company spokesman.  Plains  rose  64 cents, or 1 percent, to $63.55 at 12:02 p.m.
