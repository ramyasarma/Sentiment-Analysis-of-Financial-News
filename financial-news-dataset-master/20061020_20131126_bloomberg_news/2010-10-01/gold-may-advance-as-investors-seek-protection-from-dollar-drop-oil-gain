Gold futures climbed to another
record on investor demand for an alternative to the slumping
dollar. Silver extended a rally to a 30-year high.  The dollar fell to the lowest level since January against a
basket of currencies, partly on speculation that the Federal
Reserve will ease monetary policy further to stimulate the U.S.
economy. Gold reached an all-time high of $1,322 an ounce. Since
Sept. 14, the metal has climbed to a record in 11 sessions.  “Gold is continuing to propel itself higher on the
weakness of the dollar,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “The
Fed now wants to see inflation, and they’re going to step in and
prop up the bond market. If you’re a coupon clipper in the bond
market, you’re going to want to go with assets with higher
returns, like gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $8.20, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $1,317.80 at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, capping a 1.5 percent gain for this week. In the third
quarter, the metal rose 5.1 percent, the eighth straight gain.  Federal Reserve Bank of New York President  William Dudley 
said the outlook for U.S. job growth and inflation is
“unacceptable” and that more monetary easing is probably
needed to spur the economy and avert deflation.  The central bank has kept its benchmark rate at zero
percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and purchased
Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to help boost the
economy.  More Gains Predicted  Gold may rise 3 percent on more quantitative easing in the
U.S., Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said in a report yesterday.
The metal gained 8 percent as the U.S. used $1.7 trillion to
bolster the economy, and the second round is estimated at $500
billion to $750 billion by the first quarter, the bank said.  Gold, crude oil and other commodities are rising because
“inflation is everywhere but in the mind of the Fed,” said
 Michael Pento , a senior economist at Euro Pacific Capital in New
York. The metal will climb to $1,400 this year, he said.  The Fed’s preferred consumer-price measure, which excludes
food and fuel, rose 0.1 percent in August from the prior month
and was up 1.4 percent from a year earlier, matching the 12-
month increase in June and July. The central bank’s long-term
projection calls for an increase of 1.7 percent to 2 percent.  “Gold is not at a top yet, and $1,300, the old resistance
level, is now a level of support,” Klopfenstein of Lind-Waldock
said.  ‘Follow the Money’  Gold for immediate delivery in London reached a record
$1,320.70. Gold has gained 20 percent this year. The metal
headed for the 10th straight annual gain, the longest rally
since at least 1920.  “Dips were ultimately viewed as an opportunity to buy”
yesterday,  Edel Tully , a London-based analyst at UBS AG, said in
a report. “In September, the tendency was very much to follow
the money. As long as this persists, investors will fear missing
out on the next rally.”  Silver futures for December delivery rose 23.9 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $22.06 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the metal
reached $22.17, the highest level since October 1980. The price
gained 3.1 percent this week and surged 17 percent in the third
quarter.  Platinum futures for January delivery gained $23.50, or 1.4
percent, to $1,682.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1,689.40, the highest
level since May 18. Platinum is up 2.2 percent this week and
rallied 7.9 percent in the third quarter.  Palladium futures for December delivery advanced $3.65, or
0.6 percent, to $574.90 an ounce. Yesterday, the metal reached
$582.65, the highest level since March 2008. The price gained
2.6 percent this week and rallied 29 percent in the third
quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
