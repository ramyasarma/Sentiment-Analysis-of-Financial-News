China issued a travel advisory for
Japan after a tour group was harrassed as relations between the
two countries sunk to the lowest in five years.  Citizens planning trips to Japan should watch for their
safety, the National Tourism Administration said in a statement
posted on its website late yesterday.  A bus carrying Chinese tourists in western Japan was
blocked on Sept. 29 by Japanese right-wing demonstrators
protesting China’s attitude toward a shipping collision in
disputed waters this month, the Asahi newspaper reported
yesterday.  Ten members from the right-wing group surrounded the bus 
in Fukuoka City, kicking the vehicle and yelling “The Senkaku
islands belong to Japan,” the newspaper said. Police arrived at
the scene and the bus left safely without anyone getting hurt,
the Asahi said.  The islets, known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in
Chinese, are located in the East China Sea. Japan last week
released a Chinese fishing boat captain it had detained for 17
days after his ship collided with two Coast Guard vessels.  The diplomatic row is the most serious since 2005, when
thousands of Chinese protested Japanese textbooks that
downplayed the nation’s wartime atrocities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
