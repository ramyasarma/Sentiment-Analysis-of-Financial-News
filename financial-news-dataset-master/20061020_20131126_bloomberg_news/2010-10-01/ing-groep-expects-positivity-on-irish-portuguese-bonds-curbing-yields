Irish and Portuguese government bonds
may benefit from “follow-through positivity” after Ireland
detailed the costs of a bank bailout and Portugal outlined
deficit-cutting plans, ING Groep NV said.  “A follow-through from here requires that the market plays
ball and gets Irish and Portuguese yields down through continued
buying,”  Padhraic Garvey , a fixed-income strategist in
Amsterdam, said today in an e-mailed note. “Our baseline
expectation is that we do see some follow-through positivity in
Irish and Portuguese bonds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
