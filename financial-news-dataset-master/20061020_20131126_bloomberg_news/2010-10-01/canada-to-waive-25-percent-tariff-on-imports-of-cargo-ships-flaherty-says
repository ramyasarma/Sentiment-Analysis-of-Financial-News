Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today his government will waive a 25 percent tax
on imported cargo vessels, which will save ship owners C$25
million ($24.5 million) a year for 10 years.  The finance minister, who was speaking by the Welland Canal
that links Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, said the measure will
apply to general cargo vessels, tankers, and larger ferries.  “The measure responds to Canada’s need to maintain a
modern and efficient shipping industry that serves as a vital
transportation link for Canada’s internal and external trade in
agriculture, mining and manufacturing,” Flaherty said.  “This is going to position all Canadian ship owners to look
at their older ships and consider replacing them,” said  Wayne A. Smith , Algoma Central Corp.’s senior commercial vice-
president. “The time to renew is now.”  The company’s ‘Algocanada’ -- an 11,000 metric ton tanker
built 2 years ago and loaded with diesel -- was visible at
Flaherty’s announcement. St. Catharines-based Algoma Central
owns and operates as fleet of vessels that carry raw materials
such as coal and grain.  The measure applies retroactively, according to a  statement 
issued on the Finance Ministry’s website. Earlier today, B.C.
Ferries announced that it would use part of the C$119.4 million
in tariff rebates it will receive to reduce fares by 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
