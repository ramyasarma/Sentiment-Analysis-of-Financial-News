Reynolds Group Holdings Ltd., the New
Zealand company that’s buying Pactiv Corp., said lenders agreed
to extend an existing facility by $2.02 billion, cutting the
debt it needs from other sources to fund the buyout.  The maker of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil, controlled by New
Zealand’s richest man  Graeme Hart , had previously said the
existing term facility would be extended by about $1.5 billion,
according to a statement distributed by Business Wire today. The
change means the company will seek about $3 billion of other
senior debt to help fund the Pactiv purchase, instead of $3.5
billion, according to the statement.  Reynolds Group agreed to buy Lake Forest, Illinois-based
Pactiv, the maker of Hefty trash bags, in August for $33.25 a
share, 39 percent more than the $23.97 close on May 14 before
talks were disclosed. The acquisition, worth about $6 billion,
is the biggest deal for 55-year-old Hart, a former tow-truck
driver who built his fortune buying grocery, dairy and retail
assets.  Reynolds Group, based in Auckland, is also using about $734
million of equity and available cash to fund the Pactiv buyout,
according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
