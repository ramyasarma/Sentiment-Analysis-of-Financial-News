California  will spend 7.71 percent of
its tax revenue to pay off debt this year, the highest level
since at least 1990, even as interest rates remain low.  The ratio of debt-service to general-fund revenue in the
fiscal year that ended in June was 6.69 percent, Treasurer  Bill Lockyer  said in a report today. California intends to sell $26.8
billion of tax-backed bonds between now and the end of fiscal
2012, Lockyer said.  The increased  borrowing costs  comes as the state, which
sells more municipal bonds than any other, faces a $19.1 billion
deficit in the fiscal year that began July 1. The global
recession left the state with a 12.4 percent unemployment rate
in August. Lockyer has said the debt-to-revenue ratio will climb
to 9.18 percent by 2028.  “The increase has occurred in large part because the state
has sold more bonds to finance critically needed, voter-enacted
infrastructure projects at a time when the state’s overall
revenues have dropped precipitously,” Lockyer said in his
annual Debt Affordability Report.  Yields on AAA rated municipal securities maturing in 30
years have declined to 4.11 percent as of yesterday from a one-
year high of 4.51 percent in November, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  extra yield  investors demand on 10-
year California bonds remained unchanged yesterday at 121 basis
points, or 1.21 percent, down from 1.53 percent in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
