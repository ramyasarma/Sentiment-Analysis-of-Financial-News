European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Michael Bonello  said Ireland is addressing its
banking problems and it will take time to fully resolve the
issue.  As the Irish economy recovers, that may increase the value
of some of the assets taken over by Ireland’s state-owned bad
bank, known as the National Asset Management Agency, he said.  “The situation is being addressed. One has to give it some
time,” Bonello said in an interview in Brussels today. “In
time as the economy picks up, some of the assets are probably
going to have a better value or prove to have a bit more worth
than the way they were priced now,” he said.  On the euro-area economy, Bonello, who is also governor of
Malta’s central bank, said the slower pace of growth being seen
in the second half was anticipated.  The ECB’s latest forecasts “suggest a slowdown in the
second half of this year which is what we had expected,” he
said. “Although again there are little areas of more positive
developments here and there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
