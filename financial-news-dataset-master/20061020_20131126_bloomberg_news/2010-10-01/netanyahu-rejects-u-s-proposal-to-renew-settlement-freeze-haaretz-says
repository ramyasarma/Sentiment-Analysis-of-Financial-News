Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has rejected an Obama administration proposal to
extend a freeze on West Bank settlement building in return for
U.S. security guarantees, Haaretz said, citing unidentified
“senior American officials.”  The Obama administration is upset that the proposal, which
would have extended the settlement freeze by 2 months, was
rejected by Netanyahu, Haaretz quoted one of the officials as
saying.   The White House denied a letter outlining the proposal was
presented to Israel, and Netanyahu’s declined to comment on the
story, Haaretz said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
