The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan final index of U.S. consumer sentiment for September
fell to 68.2 from 68.9 in August.  The gauge was projected to fall to 67, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists, and
compares with a preliminary reading of 66.6 issued last month.
The index averaged 89 in the five years leading up to the
recession.  Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley
said today the outlook for U.S. job growth and inflation is
“unacceptable” and that the central bank has options to add
stimulus without major drawbacks.  Consumer spending rose more than forecast in August as
incomes climbed, a report earlier today from the Commerce
Department showed. Purchases rose 0.4 percent for a second
month. Incomes were up 0.5 percent, the biggest advance this
year, propelled by the resumption of extended and emergency
unemployment benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
