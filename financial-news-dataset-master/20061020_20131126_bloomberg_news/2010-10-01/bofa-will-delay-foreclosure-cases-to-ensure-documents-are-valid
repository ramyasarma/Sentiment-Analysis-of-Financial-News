Bank of America Corp.  became the
latest firm to delay foreclosures as state officials stepped up
pressure for a moratorium on evictions because lenders may have
submitted faulty documents.  Bank of America will investigate all affidavits in cases
that have not yet gone to judgment in 23 states where courts
have jurisdiction over home seizures, spokesman  Dan Frahm  said.
He estimated “tens of thousands” of the documents will be
studied and the process will take from “several days to a
couple of weeks.”  Banks are under pressure to halt foreclosures after court
documents showed  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and Ally Financial Inc.
employees may have submitted affidavits supporting their claims
without confirming their accuracy. Federal lawmakers and state
officials have said such practices could amount to fraud.
JPMorgan has said it will ask judges to postpone foreclosure
rulings, while Detroit-based Ally said Sept. 21 its GMAC
Mortgage unit would halt evictions.  Bank of America’s freeze “hopefully will give peace of
mind to those monitoring the industry that we’ve used an
abundance of caution that those foreclosures in process are
handled correctly,” Frahm said in an interview. The Charlotte,
North Carolina-based firm is not acknowledging that its
associates have made errors in the foreclosure process, Frahm
said.  “The extent of the problem is enormous,” said  Max Gardner , a
Shelby, North Carolina attorney who is involved in several
lawsuits representing borrowers alleging improper loan servicing
practices by banks. “It’s totally unrealistic for the bank to
say they can complete this study in a couple of weeks.”  State Action  Attorneys general in at least six states are investigating
borrowers’ claims that some of the nation’s largest home lenders
and loan servicers have taken improper legal shortcuts to speed
foreclosures. In Washington, Acting Comptroller of the Currency
 John Walsh  asked the nation’s seven biggest lenders to review
foreclosures for defective documents, according to the Housing
Wire website.  Home foreclosures in Connecticut should be frozen for 60
days because of “defective” documents, Attorney General  Richard Blumenthal  said today in a request to the state Judicial
Department. In California, Attorney General  Jerry Brown  said
JPMorgan should be asked to prove its home foreclosures are
legal, and must stop the practice if it can’t.  Citigroup, Wells Fargo  Citigroup Inc. , the third-largest U.S. bank by assets,
constantly reviews its document processes, “and we have strong
training to ensure that appropriate employees are fully aware of
the proper procedures,” said spokesman  Mark Rodgers  in an
e-mailed statement. “Foreclosures are monitored to make certain
that staffing is adequate to review the affidavits properly.”  Wells Fargo, ranked fourth by assets and the nation’s
biggest  home lender , said its “policies, procedures and
practices satisfy us that the affidavits we sign are accurate,”
according to an e-mailed statement yesterday from Vickee Adams
at the San Francisco-based bank. “We will stand by our
affidavits and, if we find an error, we will take the
appropriate corrective action.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
