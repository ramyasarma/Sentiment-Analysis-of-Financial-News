Daikin Industries Ltd. , the world’s
second-biggest air conditioner maker, said first-half profit
unexpectedly fell 61 percent because of a drop in the value of
its stockholdings.  Net income fell to about 4 billion yen ($48 million) from
10.1 billion yen a year earlier in the six months ended Sept. 30,
the Osaka-based company said today in a preliminary earnings
statement released after markets closed. The company had
forecast a 15.5 billion yen profit.  Daikin said Aug. 19 it expected to raise its full-year
earnings forecast after global temperatures in June matched the
hottest in more than a century, boosting air conditioner sales.
The company said first-half revenue rose 15 percent to 570
billion yen, beating its forecast by 1.8 percent.  The stock, which has fallen 15 percent this year, dropped
0.8 percent to 3,115 yen as of the close on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The company is scheduled to report full first-half
earnings on Nov. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
