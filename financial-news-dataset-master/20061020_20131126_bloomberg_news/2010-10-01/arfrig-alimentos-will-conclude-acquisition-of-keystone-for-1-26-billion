Marfrig Alimentos SA , Latin America’s
second-largest beef producer, expects to conclude its purchase
of Keystone Foods LLC today to become a supplier to restaurant
chains such as  McDonald’s Corp .  American and European antitrust authorities approved the
acquisition,  Marfrig  said today in an e-mailed statement.
Marfrig agreed to buy Keystone from private equity firm Lindsay
Goldberg LLC in June for $1.26 billion, which includes an
undisclosed amount of debt.  The purchase makes Marfrig the supplier of chicken nuggets,
hamburgers and other meat products to McDonald’s, sandwich-shop
chain Subway Restaurants,  Yum! Brands Inc . and Campbell Soup Co.
in 13 countries including the U.S., France and Australia. The
meatpacker has expanded through 38 acquisitions in the past
three years, including the takeover of Cargill Inc.’s poultry
and pork business in Brazil for $705.2 million.  Investor Relations Director  Ricardo Florence  previously
said he expected the purchase to be concluded in the third
quarter.  The company plans to finance the acquisition with the sale
of 2.5 billion reais ($1.48 billion) of five-year bonds
convertible into stock, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
