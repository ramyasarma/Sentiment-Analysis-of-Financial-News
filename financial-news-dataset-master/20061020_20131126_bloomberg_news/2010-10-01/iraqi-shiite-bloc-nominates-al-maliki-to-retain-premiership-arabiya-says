Iraqi Prime Minister  Nuri al-Maliki 
won the Shiite Muslim National Alliance’s nomination for the
premiership, beating  Adel Abdel Mahdi  and moving Iraq a step
closer to a new government after seven months of deadlock, al-
Arabiya television reported.  Talks on selecting the alliance candidate began in June,
when the Shiite parties merged to form the largest bloc in
parliament and get first crack at heading a government following
the March 7 national elections, which failed to produce a clear
winner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
