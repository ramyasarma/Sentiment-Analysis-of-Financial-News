India’s rupee advanced to its
strongest level in almost five months after central bank data
showed capital inflows more than offset a record  current-account 
deficit in first quarter of this fiscal year.  The South Asian nation’s  capital account  showed a surplus
of $17.5 billion in the three months through June, compared with
a shortfall of $13.7 billion in the current account, the  Reserve
Bank of India  said in a report yesterday. The rupee headed for a
fifth weekly gain after foreigners added a net $18.2 billion to
holdings of Indian stocks this year through Sept. 28, according
to data released yesterday by the  Securities and Exchange Board
of India .  “The balance of payments is positive with the widening
trade gap being more than adequately met through excessive
supplies from the capital account,” J.  Moses Harding , a Mumbai-
based executive vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd., wrote in a
research note today. “Rupee bulls are expected to have another
good run in October.”  The Indian currency climbed 0.6 percent to 44.695 per
dollar as of 10:10 a.m. in Mumbai, extending this week’s advance
to 1.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It rose
as high as 44.65 earlier, the strongest level since May 4. The
currency surged 4.7 percent last month, the most since May 2009.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.22 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.40
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
