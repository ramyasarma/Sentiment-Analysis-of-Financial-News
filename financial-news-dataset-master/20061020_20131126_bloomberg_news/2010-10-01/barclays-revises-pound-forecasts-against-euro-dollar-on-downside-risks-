Barclays Plc revised its forecasts
for the pound against the euro and the dollar because “short-
term downside risks have increased.”  The pound will trade at 85 pence per euro, 84 pence, 81
pence and 78 pence in one, three, six and 12 months,
respectively, Paul Robinson , head of European currency strategy
in London, wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Sterling will trade at $1.59, $1.61, $1.64 and $1.67 in the
same periods, he said.  Barclays’ previous pound-euro forecasts for one, three, 
six and 12 months were 84 pence, 81, 79 and 78 pence per euro,
respectively. It’s earlier pound-dollar predictions were $1.61,
$1.67, $1.68 and $1.68 in the periods.   The U.K. currency was little changed at 86.72 pence per
euro as of 6:52 a.m. in London. It traded at $1.5728, also
little changed from yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
