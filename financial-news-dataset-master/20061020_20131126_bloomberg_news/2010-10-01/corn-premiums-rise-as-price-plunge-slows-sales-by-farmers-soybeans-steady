Cash premiums for corn shipped to
export terminals near New Orleans this month widened relative to
Chicago futures as U.S. farmers reduced sales after prices
plunged the most in eight months. Soybean premiums were steady.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
October was 44 cents to 48 cents a bushel above December
futures, compared with 43 cents to 46 cents yesterday,
government  data  show. Soybean premiums were 55 cents to 65 cents
above November futures compared with 58 cents to 62 cents.  “After the massive drop in prices today, farmers will be
more reluctant to sell until prices rebound,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm-marketing consultant at Toay Commodity Futures
Group LLC in Nashville, Illinois. “The next move will be driven
by a change in demand.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell the exchange limit
of 30 cents, or 6.1 percent, to close at $4.6575 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest drop for a most-active
contract since Jan. 12. The price dropped 11 percent this week.  Soybean futures for November delivery declined 49.75 cents,
or 4.5 percent, to settle at $10.57 a bushel, the biggest drop
since July 7, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
