Ghana’s economy will grow by 5.9
percent in 2010, the Ghana Statistical Service said, basing the
projection on first-half data extrapolated for the whole year.  The growth will be led by a 10.5 percent increase in mining
and quarrying and a 4.6 percent expansion in cocoa production
and marketing, the Accra-based agency said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
