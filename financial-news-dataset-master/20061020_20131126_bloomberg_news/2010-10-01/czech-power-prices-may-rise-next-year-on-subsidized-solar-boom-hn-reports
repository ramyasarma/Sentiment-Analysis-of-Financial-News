The cost of electricity in the Czech
Republic next year may rise 12 percent for households and up to
18 percent for companies as a result of a boom in subsidized
solar power production, Hospodarske Noviny reported, citing
Josef Firt, the chairman of the country’s energy regulatory
office.  The Czech government is seeking way to mitigate the power
price hike and may impose higher tax on traditional energy
sources such as coal and gas, the newspaper said, citing deputy
finance minister Ladislav Mincic.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
