Russia’s  manufacturing  expansion
slowed in September to the lowest level since March as
international demand weakened and new export business declined
for the third consecutive month, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index slid to 51.2 from 52.9 in
August, HSBC said in a report today, citing data compiled by
Markit Economics. The survey-based index indicates a contraction
when it is below 50 and growth with a figure above 50.  Russia’s economic recovery from last year’s 7.9 percent
contraction, the biggest on record, remains uneven, the central
bank said.  “Some indicators of industrial activity and investment
improved in August from the previous month, although signs of
unstable economic growth remain,” Bank Rossii said in a
statement on Sept. 28.  Gross domestic product  may expand as little as 3.6 percent
in 2010, Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach said on Sept.
24. The government left its official GDP forecast for this year
unchanged at 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
