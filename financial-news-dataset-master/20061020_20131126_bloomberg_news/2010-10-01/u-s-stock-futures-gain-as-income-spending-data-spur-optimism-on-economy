U.S. stock futures gained, indicating
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may build on the best September
rally since 1939, as faster-than-forecast growth in personal
spending and incomes bolstered optimism in the economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December increased 0.5 percent to 1,142.8 at 8:32 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 0.4 percent to
10,768.     Consumer purchases rose 0.4 percent for a second month,
Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington. The gain
exceeded the 0.3 percent increase projected by the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Incomes were
up 0.5 percent, the biggest advance this year, propelled by the
resumption of extended and emergency unemployment benefits.  In September, all 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 and all
30 stocks in the Dow gained, turning both measures positive for
2010, amid speculation the world’s largest economy will avoid
slipping back into a recession and bets that the Federal Reserve
will buy more debt to support the recovery.  U.S. futures followed Asian and European stocks higher
earlier after China’s manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace
in four months in September, adding to signs that economic
growth is stabilizing. The purchasing managers’ index rose to
53.8 from 51.7 in August, according to China’s logistics
federation and statistics bureau. That beat the median economist
forecast of 52.5 in a Bloomberg News survey. Readings above 50
indicate growth.   U.S. manufacturing may have expanded in September at the
slowest pace in 10 months, underscoring the Federal Reserve’s
forecast of “modest” U.S. growth, economists estimated before
a report due 10 a.m. Washington time today. The Institute for
Supply Management’s factory index dropped to 54.5 from 56.3 in
August, according to the median estimate of economists.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
