Russian President Dmitry Medvedev may
raise Orascom Telecom Holding SAE’s tax problems during his
visit to Algeria next week, Kommersant said.   
  VimpelCom Ltd., the Russian mobile operator that is in talks
to buy a 51 percent stake in Orascom from billionaire Naguib
Sawiris, will send executives with Medvedev to participate in a
business forum in Algeria, the newspaper said. Orascom’s
Algerian unit Djezzy has received almost $830 million in claims
for back taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
