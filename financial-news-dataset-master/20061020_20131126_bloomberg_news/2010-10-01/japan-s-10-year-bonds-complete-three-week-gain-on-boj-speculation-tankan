Japan’s 10-year government  bonds 
gained for a third week on speculation Bank of Japan policy
makers will introduce further easing measures to keep the
nation’s economic recovery intact.  Benchmark  yields  fell to a five-week low after the central
bank’s Tankan survey showed the nation’s large manufacturers
forecast pessimists will outnumber optimists by year-end.
Japanese Economy Minister  Banri Kaieda  said yesterday that he
expects the government and central bank to work together to stop
deflation and improve the job market.  “Considering the current economic climate, it’s
increasingly uncertain whether deflation will subside sometime
next year,” said  Hiroshi Morikawa , a senior strategist in Tokyo
at MU Investments, which manages about $14 billion in assets.
“Bond yields will probably continue to edge down.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond declined four basis
points to 0.955 percent this week at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1 percent debt due
September 2020 added 0.364 yen to 100.409 yen. The yield sank to
0.92 percent on Sept. 29, the lowest since Aug. 26. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery gained 0.44 to
143.32 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The  Tankan  index of sentiment at large manufacturers
climbed by 7 points in September, the smallest increase since
early 2009, the Bank of Japan said on Sept. 29. Confidence is
expected to fall to minus 1 in December, the report said.
Negative numbers mean pessimists outnumber optimists.  CPI, Unemployment  The Bank of Japan will likely respond to a rising yen by
expanding its 30-trillion yen ($360 billion) lending facility at
a two-day policy meeting that ends on Oct. 5, 14 of 17
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said. BOJ Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  said on Sept. 27 the bank is prepared to ease monetary
policy further should a stronger yen threaten the economy.  “I hope the BOJ will make efforts to address the
challenges of overcoming deflation and striding for maximum
employment by doing what it can” with the government, Economy
Minister Kaieda said at a press conference in Tokyo yesterday.  Consumer prices excluding fresh food slid 1 percent in
August, extending its year-on-year drop to an 18th month, a
government report showed yesterday. The jobless rate fell to 5.1
percent in August from 5.2 percent in July, while the number of
people no longer in the labor force increased, it said.  Auction Results  Bets on further easing boosted demand at a 2.6 trillion yen
auction of two-year notes on Sept. 28. The sale drew bids for
5.75 times the amount on offer, the highest bid-to-cover ratio
since June 2005. The lowest-accepted price was 99.92, surpassing
the 99.915 estimated by traders in a Bloomberg survey.  Gains in bonds were limited after a report yesterday showed
China’s purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.8 in September,
the most since May. The figure was forecast to rise to 52.5,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. China was Japan’s
biggest export market by the value of products shipped during
the first half of 2010, Finance Ministry  data  show.  “The manufacturing report has confirmed China’s economy is
unlikely to lose steam,” said  Ayako Sera , who helps oversee
about $310 billion in Tokyo as a strategist at Sumitomo Trust &
Banking Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
