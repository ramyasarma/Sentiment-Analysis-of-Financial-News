Corporations from the U.S., Japan and
Europe increased the percentage of projected income hedged
against swings in foreign-exchange rates to a record, a
quarterly survey of clients by JPMorgan Chase & Co. showed.  Companies lifted the amount of estimated 12-month forward
earnings hedged to 34.3 percent on average in September from
24.7 percent in June, according to the survey conducted Sept. 14
to Sept. 24 of 105 clients with a total market capitalization of
about $2 trillion. That surpassed the previous peak of 31.4
percent in September 2008, the bank said in a report today. The
bank’s survey uses a weighted average, by firm size.  JPMorgan’s  index  of implied volatility on options for Group
of Seven currencies dropped 13 percent in the third quarter,
after jumping 22 percent in the prior three months. Japan
intervened in the currency markets last month for the first time
since 2004 after the yen strengthened to a 15-year high against
the dollar. U.S. lawmakers are considering punitive measures
against China amid charges the yuan is kept artificially low
versus the dollar to provide an unfair trade advantage.  “This aggressiveness could reflect corporations’ greater
sensitivity to foreign exchange risk given the frequency of
market shocks this year,” JPMorgan strategists  Yoonyi Kim  and
 John Normand  wrote in the note. “The rise in year-ahead
coverage was mainly boosted by a 22 percentage point rise in the
U.S. corporations’ hedge ratio to 55.7 percent, the highest on
record.”  The dollar fell 7 percent to $1.3634 per euro in September,
the biggest monthly loss since December 2008 as signs the U.S.
economy is slowing reduced demand for the nation’s assets. The
greenback fell versus all of its major counterparts in the third
quarter.  Euro Forecasts  The average forecast for euro’s year-end level by global
corporations increased to $1.31 from $1.22 in June, according to
the survey. The average forecast for December 2011 was also
$1.31 in September, compared from $1.25 in June. European
corporations were the most bullish on the euro, anticipating a
rise to $1.40 by the end of 2011, which was 10 percent higher
than the average of U.S. corporations’ forecasts.  Corporations from the U.S., Europe and Japan changed their
average year-end forecasts for the dollar versus the yen to 86
in the survey, down from 93 in June. As much as 25 percent of
clients surveyed forecast the exchange rate will end 2010 below
83 even as the Bank of Japan sold $25 billion yen last month to
weaken its currency.  The yen strengthened 0.8 percent to 83.53 per dollar in
September, the fifth consecutive monthly increase. It has
appreciated 12 percent so far this year versus the greenback.  Almost 30 percent of the Japanese corporations forecast the
currency would move below 83 by the end of the year, the survey
showed.  “This view could signal that they either do not expect
additional intervention, or that they do not believe
intervention to be effective in stopping Japanese yen
appreciation,” the Kim and Normand wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
