Bunge Ltd. , Argentina’s second-
biggest exporter, had its Buenos Aires office raided today by
tax authorities amid a $106 million dispute.  The raid was ordered by a federal judge, said an official
for the tax agency who cannot be named under government policy.
Judge Carlos Ochoa is based in Rio Cuarto, in the central
province of Cordoba, the official said in a phone interview.  Argentina’s tax agency last month said that four of the
South American country’s 10 biggest exporters and cereals and
soybean processors underpaid taxes. The agency didn’t name the
companies in the report, which was published on its  website .  Argentina is the world’s largest exporter of soy oil, the
second largest of corn and third of soybeans. Bunge was the
country’s largest exporter of edible oils in 2009, according to
a report by JJ Hinrichsen SA, a Buenos Aires-based researcher.  Bunge is “cooperating fully with the authorities,”
spokeswoman Susan Burns said in an e-mailed response to
questions. She declined to elaborate.  Bunge , based in White Plains, New York, dropped $1.71, or
2.9 percent, to close at $57.45 at 5:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock earlier dropped as much as
4.7 percent to $56.38 after the investigation was announced.  Cargill was the biggest exporter in Argentina in 2009,
followed by Bunge, according to industry ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
