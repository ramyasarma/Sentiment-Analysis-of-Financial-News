Telekomunikacja Polska SA , Poland’s
biggest phone company, plans to place a bid for domestic cable
television operator Aster Sp. z o.o.  Telekomunikacja, a unit of  France Telecom SA , received an
invitation to acquire Aster from its owner, Mid Europa Partners
LLP, TPSA Chief Executive Officer  Maciej Witucki  said at a news
conference in Warsaw today.  “We will look at this transaction and we will even place
an offer, but our bid will certainly be below those offers that
could be placed by other cable operators,” Witucki said. “This
is because cable operators can have bigger synergies.”  Aster, which provides services in three Polish cities
including Warsaw, had 380,000 cable-television clients and
174,000 Internet subscribers at the end of June, according to
the company’s website. Aster also provides fixed-line and mobile
phone services.  Witucki didn’t say how much Telekomunikacja may offer for
Aster.  Multimedia Polska SA , Poland’s biggest cable television
operator with 674,000 clients, has a market value of 1.49
billion zloty ($519 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
