A Canadian pension fund manager
became sole owner of Nomura Holdings Inc.’s headquarters in
London’s main financial district after acquiring the 50 percent
stake it didn’t already own.  Oxford Properties Group Inc., the real estate investment
arm of Toronto-based  Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement
System , acquired the stake in Watermark Place from a fund
managed by UBS Asset Management, according to a statement today
that didn’t disclose the purchase price.  Property Week reported last month that UBS put the stake up
for sale for about 200 million pounds ($317 million). Ollie
Gadney, a spokesman for the bank, declined to comment on the
price.  The deal is “in line with our strategy and further
demonstrates our commitment to the London market,” Paul
Brundage, senior managing director of Oxford’s European arm,
said in the statement.  Nomura, Japan’s largest brokerage, agreed to rent the
525,000-square-foot (49,000-square-meter) building on the north
bank of the River Thames in the City of London last year,
getting a rent-free period of six years on a 20-year lease. The
move allows the Japanese bank to combine its London operations
with the U.K. arm of collapsed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
based at Canary Wharf.  The Canadian Fund manages C$48 billion ($46.89 billion) of
investments for the 400,000 members of the retirement plan,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
