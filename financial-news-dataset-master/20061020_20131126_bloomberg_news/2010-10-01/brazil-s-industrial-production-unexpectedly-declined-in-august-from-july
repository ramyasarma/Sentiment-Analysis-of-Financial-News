Brazil’s industrial  output  unexpectedly
fell in August, sending yields on interest futures lower, as a
stronger real weighed on exporters and re-stocking tailed off.  The 0.1 percent decline in production from July surprised
31 of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg whose median forecast
was for a 0.5 percent expansion. Output expanded 8.9 percent
from a year earlier, the national statistics agency said, less
than the 9.4 percent median estimate of 33 analysts.  The monthly contraction supports the central bank’s view
that the economy is slowing, diminishing the need for additional
rate increases, said  Neil Shearing , a senior emerging-markets
economist at Capital Economics Ltd., who had forecast that
industrial output would remain flat in August.  “The real’s strength is crimping manufacturing exports,
and domestic demand has weakened as monetary tightening takes
hold,” said Shearing in a telephone interview from London. The
end of a cycle of companies re-stocking had also depressed
demand for manufactured goods, he added.  The real strengthened for a sixth day, surging 0.7 percent
to 1.6764 per U.S. dollar at 9:31 a.m. New York time, its
highest level in two years. In the overnight interest-rate
futures market, the yield on the contract due in January 2012
fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 11.44
percent.  Industries, Investment  Sixteen of 27 industries reduced output, led by a 5.8
percent monthly drop in the production of metals and 3.6 percent
decline in oil and ethanol refining.  Capital goods production, a barometer of future investment,
rose 1.4 percent from July and jumped 28 percent from a year
ago. Production of consumer goods, durable items and
intermediate goods all posted monthly declines.  Brazil’s economy will expand 7.53 percent in 2010, up from
a week-earlier forecast of 7.47 percent, according to the median
forecast in a central bank survey of about 100 economists
published Sept. 27. That would be the fastest growth since 1985,
when the economy expanded 7.85 percent.  Policy makers on Sept. 1 kept the benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 10.75 percent, after raising the Selic a total of
two percentage points over their three previous meetings to
prevent Latin America’s biggest economy from overheating.  Analysts forecast policy makers will resume rate increases
in March, lifting the Selic to 11.75 percent by June, according
to the median forecast in the central bank survey.  Consumer inflation  as measured by the IPCA-15 index
accelerated to 4.57 percent in the year through mid-September.
The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus
two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
