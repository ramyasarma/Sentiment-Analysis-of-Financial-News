Soybeans fell the most in more than
14 months as dry weather allows U.S. farmers to accelerate the
pace of the harvest, while rain in Brazil and Argentina improves
crop conditions.  Few showers are forecast over the next two weeks in U.S.
growing areas,  T-Storm Weather LLC  said today in a report. Rains
this week in South America improved soil moisture for planting
crops, with more moisture expected in some northern regions next
week, the private forecaster said. The U.S. is the biggest
producer and exporter, followed by Brazil and Argentina.  “The U.S. harvest is moving forward, and farmers are
reporting tremendous yields,” said  Dax Wedemeyer , an analyst
and broker for U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.
“The rains in Brazil were helpful this week for boosting
planting progress, and more will be needed later this month for
early development.”  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 49.75 cents, or
4.5 percent, to close at $10.57 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest drop for a most-active
contract since July 2009. Prices fell 6.1 percent this week, the
most in 13 months.  On Sept. 27, the commodity reached an eight-month high of
$11.44 on speculation that rains may damage U.S. crops and dry
weather would delay planting in South America. Prices rose 23
percent in the July-through-September period, the biggest
quarterly rally since the second quarter of 2008.  U.S. production will total 3.483 billion bushels, up 3.7
percent from a record 3.359 billion last year, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said Sept. 10. The government is
scheduled to update its forecast on Oct. 8.  The U.S. soybean crop was valued at $31.8 billion last
year, second only to corn, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
