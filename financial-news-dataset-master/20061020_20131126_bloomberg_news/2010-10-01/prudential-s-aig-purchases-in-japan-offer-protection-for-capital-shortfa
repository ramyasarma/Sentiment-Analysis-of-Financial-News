American International Group Inc.,
the insurer that’s selling two Japanese units to  Prudential
Financial Inc. , agreed to cut the purchase price if the capital
in its subsidiaries slips below 554 billion yen ($6.7 billion).  The $4.8 billion price would be reduced if the combined
capital of AIG Star Life Insurance Co. and AIG Edison Life
Insurance Co. falls below the agreed amount, Newark, New Jersey-
based Prudential said today in a regulatory filing.  AIG, brought to the brink of collapse in 2008 when
investments soured, is selling units to repay a U.S. rescue. The
New York-based company, which agreed in March to sell a
subsidiary to  MetLife Inc. , pledged in that transaction to
indemnify the buyer against losses on bets its unit made on
Japanese commercial mortgages.  Prudential, led by Chief Executive Officer  John Strangfeld ,
is buying Star and Edison from AIG to expand in the world’s
second-largest life insurance market. The insurer, which entered
Japan in 1987, will pay $4.2 billion in cash and assume $600
million in debt.  Prudential secured a commitment letter for a $3 billion
term-loan bridge facility to backstop financing of the deal, the
company said in the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
