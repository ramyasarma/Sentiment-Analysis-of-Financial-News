Copper jumped to a 26-month high in
New York after a report showed manufacturing accelerated in
China, the world’s biggest metal consumer.  China’s purchasing manager’s index rose to 53.8 in
September from 51.7 in August, signaling the fastest expansion
in four months, data from the country’s logistics federation and
statistics bureau showed. Copper also rose as the  dollar  fell to
the lowest level since January against a basket of six major
currencies, bolstering the investment appeal of the metal.  “We are bullish longer term on copper,” said  Evan Smith ,
who helps manage $2 billion at U.S. Global Investors Inc. in San
Antonio. “China will be the biggest contributor to higher
prices. Prices also get a lot of support from the dollar.”  Copper futures for December delivery climbed 3.90 cents, or
1.1 percent, to close at $3.6905 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $3.722, the
highest level since July 30, 2008. This week, the metal advanced
2 percent, the third straight gain.  Inventories monitored by the London Metal Exchange fell for
the fifth straight day to the lowest level since Nov. 3.
Stockpiles are down 26 percent this year, on course for the
first annual decline since 2004. Refined-copper output will
trail demand next year, the first deficit since 2007, the
International Copper Study Group said.  “Copper is getting more difficult to find,” Smith said.
“There are no significant sources of supply coming into the
market.”  On the LME,  copper  for delivery in three months climbed
$86, or 1.1 percent, to $8,100 a metric ton ($3.67 a pound). The
price has gained 35 percent in the past 12 months.  Tin rose $650, or 2.7 percent, to $24,900 a ton in London.
Earlier, the prices reached $25,200, the highest level since May
16, 2008.  Nickel climbed $445, or 1.9 percent, to $23,845 a ton. The
metal was up for the eighth straight session, the longest rally
since April 2007.  Aluminum, zinc and lead also rose.  To contact the reporters on the story:
