Toshiba Corp.’s Westinghouse Electric
Co. may invest $5 billion to $6 billion to build a nuclear power
plant in Italy, Senior Vice President Daniel Lipman told Il
Messaggero in an interview.  Westinghouse, which has contracts for 400 million euros
with Italian companies, will buy components locally, spending
about 55 percent of its total investment with Italian suppliers,
Lipman said.  Westinghouse has had contacts with A2A SpA for the project,
Lipman said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
