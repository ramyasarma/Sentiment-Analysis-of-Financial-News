Cocoa production in  Ivory Coast , the
world’s biggest grower of the beans, will decline by 10 percent
during the main part of the harvest, as diseases and aging trees
affect output.  The country will produce 800,000 metric tons during the
October-to-March main crop harvest, from 900,000 tons in the
same period of last year, Gilbert N’Guessan Anoh, president of
the Coffee and Cocoa Management Committee said in an interview.  “Old trees, diseases like black pod or swollen shoot” will
affect the harvest, he said in the port city of San Pedro, where
the 2010-11 harvest began today.  Diseases, including black pod rot fungus and swollen shoot
virus, affect the harvest of the chocolate ingredient across
West and Central Africa, which accounts for 64 percent of global
production, according to the International Cocoa Organization.  Many of Africa’s cocoa trees are 35 to 50 years old,  Sona Ebai , secretary-general of the Cocoa Producers’ Alliance said in
March. Old trees mean lower yields on farms, he said.  Cocoa for December delivery declined 30 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2,784 per ton by 1:20 p.m. in New York today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
