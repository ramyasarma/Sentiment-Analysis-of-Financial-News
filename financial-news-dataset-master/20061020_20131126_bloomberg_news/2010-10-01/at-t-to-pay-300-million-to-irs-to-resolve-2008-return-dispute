AT&T Inc. , the largest U.S. phone
company, said it recorded a one-time $8.3 billion gain in the
third quarter related to the depreciation of assets from its
acquisition of Cingular Wireless in 2006.  The gain boosted AT&T’s third-quarter earnings per share by
$1.40,  Rolf Gatlin , a spokesman, said in an interview today. The
Dallas-based carrier is scheduled to report third-quarter
earnings later this year. The change will affect AT&T’s cash
flow over a 15-year period, starting in 2008.  The carrier will report the gain as a reduction in income-
tax liabilities, according to a regulatory filing today. Related
to the arrangement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, AT&T
also agreed to pay $300 million to the agency in the fourth
quarter to settle a disagreement regarding the company’s 2008
tax return.  Analysts project third-quarter earnings of 56 cents a
share, according to the average of  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  AT&T rose 21 cents to $28.81 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares have added 2.8 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
