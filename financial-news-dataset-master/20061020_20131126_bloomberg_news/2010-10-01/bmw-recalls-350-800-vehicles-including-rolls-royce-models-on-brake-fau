Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, said it’s recalling almost
350,800 BMW-brand and Rolls-Royce models worldwide to repair a
power-brake fault. The stock fell the  most  in three months.  The voluntary recall involves fixing brake-pressure pumps
on 345,000 BMW 5-, 6- and 7-Series models and 5,800 Rolls-Royce
cars built from 2002 until 2010, Frank Strebe, a BMW spokesman,
said today in a phone interview from the Paris Motor Show. The
new version of the 5-Series sedan isn’t affected, he said.  The fault was detected when drivers complained that they
needed to push harder on the brake pedal on cars with high
mileage, Strebe said. The Munich-based carmaker is telling
customers to bring in their vehicles as a “pro-active”
measure, and that the fault poses no safety issue, he said,
adding that he doesn’t have an estimate of the cost to BMW.  BMW  fell  4.2 percent to 49.30 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close
in Frankfurt, in the biggest drop since July 1. That pared the
stock’s gain this year to 55 percent.  The recall  includes  198,000 BMW and Rolls-Royce cars in the
U.S., according to the company’s North American unit. Mechanical
braking is still available even if the fault, a pump-system leak
that may cause vacuum loss, affects power braking, according to
the automaker.  Any repairs should take less than half a day, and probably
only “a couple of hours,” to complete, Strebe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
