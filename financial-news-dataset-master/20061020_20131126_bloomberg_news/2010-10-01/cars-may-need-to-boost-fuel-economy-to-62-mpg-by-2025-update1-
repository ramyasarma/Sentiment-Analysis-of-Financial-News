U.S. automakers may be required to
almost double vehicle fuel economy to as much as 62 miles per
gallon by 2025 models, the Obama administration said in a
technical analysis released today in Washington.  The government projects increasing fuel standards 3 percent
to 6 percent a year, starting with 2017 models, according to an
analysis that starts a review that will end in mid-2012. A 6
percent annual gain would result in the 62 mpg standard, while 3
percent would lead to 47 mpg by 2025, according to the report.  Environmentalists are pressing for more aggressive targets
after President  Barack Obama  in a rule last April required
automakers to meet 5 percent annual increases, building to 35.5
mpg for 2016 models. The auto industry said today’s analysis is
preliminary and will change. In May, Obama ordered agencies to
develop a time line and potential targets for 2017-2025 models.  “We must, and we will, keep the momentum going,”
Transportation Secretary  Ray LaHood  said today in a statement.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of his
department, helps set the targets.  Today’s notice establishes a final rule by July 31, 2012,
with a proposal completed by Sept. 30, 2011. The administration
plans a more detailed analysis by Nov. 30.  The report is “based on very preliminary and incomplete
data at this point, and inevitably will change,” said  Dave McCurdy , chief executive officer of the Washington-based
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. “We will carefully review
the technical assessment’s assumptions.”  The alliance represents companies including  General Motors
Co ., Chrysler Group LLC and  Ford Motor Co.   A 6 percent increase “will be the biggest single step the
United States can take to cut global warming and our oil
addiction,” said  Dan Becker , director of Washington-based Safe
Climate Campaign, in a statement today. “This proposal
represents the triumph of technology over intransigence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
