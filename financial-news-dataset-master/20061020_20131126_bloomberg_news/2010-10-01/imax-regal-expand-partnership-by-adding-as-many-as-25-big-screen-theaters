Imax Corp.  and  Regal Entertainment
Group , the largest U.S. theater chain, will expand a joint-
venture agreement by adding as many as 25 big-screen cinemas as
studios release more 3-D movies.  Imax and Regal will add 16 to 25 more theaters, the
companies said today in an e-mailed statement. Of the 39 planned
in the 2008 agreement, 34 are in operation, the companies said.  Regal is installing more Imax screens as Hollywood studios
increase their use of 3-D and high-definition technologies.
Imax, based in Mississauga, Ontario, has announced plans this
year for 198 additional theaters in countries including Russia
and China, up from 35 new locations in all of 2009.  “It’s been a very good partnership for both us,” Imax
Chief Executive Officer  Rich Gelfond  said in an interview.
“We’ve gotten good returns and they’ve gotten really good
returns.”  Under the agreement Imax pays the cost of equipment, about
$500,000 per theater, and Regal covers the cost of renovations,
about $150,000, Gelfond said. They share box-office revenue, he
said. The agreements have provided an annual rate of return of
more than 50 percent, he said.  The company will pursue more joint ventures instead of
lease agreements, which provide Imax an initial cash payment and
royalties, Gelfond said.  Imax Shares  Imax rose $1.14 to $18 at 12:42 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The shares had gained 27 percent
