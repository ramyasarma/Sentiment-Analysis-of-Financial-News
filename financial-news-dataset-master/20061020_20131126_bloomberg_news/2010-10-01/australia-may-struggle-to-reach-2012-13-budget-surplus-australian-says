Australia may struggle to achieve a
budget surplus in 2012-13 without making cuts to government
spending, the Australian newspaper reported, citing a briefing
to Finance Minister Penny Wong. It suggests scrapping a
commitment to keep defense spending growing by 3 percent a year
for the next 20 years and tightening eligibility to the pension,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
