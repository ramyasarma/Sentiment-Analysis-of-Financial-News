President  Barack Obama , after
finishing a four-state campaign trip, told Democratic donors in
Washington that Americans are looking for an “affirmative
vision” to move the country forward and don’t support
Republican proposals.  “They genuinely believe and are rooting for us coming up
with a plan that can rally the country together and move us
forward,” he said at fundraiser for the Democratic National
Committee. “They’re not persuaded by the other side, they
really aren’t.”  Obama is helping the Democratic National Committee raise
$1.75 million tonight at two events. Already this month, the
president has raised $3 million for Democratic party
organizations and candidates after raising more than $7 million
in August.  The president said the party faces a “tough” fight in
November’s congressional elections. Political analysts such as
the non-partisan  Cook Political Report  say Republicans have an
opportunity to win control of the U.S. House of Representatives
and to gain seats in the Senate.  Obama said he is “absolutely confident” Democrats can
hold on to their majorities if they get supporters to the polls.  “I’m going to need all of you to keep it up,” Obama said
at a fundraiser in the Washington home of former aide  Linda Douglass . “Don’t rest. You’ll have time to rest on Nov. 3.”  Obama has been campaigning around the country to defend
Democratic majorities in Congress. The entire House and more
than one-third of the seats in the Senate are at stake in this
year’s election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
