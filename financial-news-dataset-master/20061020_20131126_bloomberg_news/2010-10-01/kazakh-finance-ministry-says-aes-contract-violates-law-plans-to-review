The Kazakh Finance Ministry said the
government plans to review a contract with U.S.-based power
producer  AES Corp.  because the current agreement contains
clauses that aren’t in compliance with Kazakh law.  A new draft contract has been sent to AES, the ministry
said today in an e-mailed response to questions. The ministry
seeks to change contract provisions on setting rates, the volume
of investment obligations, responsibility for making investments
and the return of assets to the state.  Alexei Bendz, a spokesman for AES in Kazakhstan, said the
company has received no official notification that its contract
will be reviewed. AES is involved in “lengthy negotiations”
with the state over certain provisions of the contract, he said.  Bendz said by telephone that he doesn’t expect “radical
changes” in the contract, which was signed in the late 1990s.
Some provisions have become outdated because of legislative
changes since the agreement was signed, he said.  The Kazakh Natural Monopolies Regulation Agency said in
April that AES had failed to invest $459 million in the country,
and that the Finance Ministry may restore state control over AES
assets after reviewing its contracts. AES said at the time that
the agency’s charge was “groundless and inaccurate.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
