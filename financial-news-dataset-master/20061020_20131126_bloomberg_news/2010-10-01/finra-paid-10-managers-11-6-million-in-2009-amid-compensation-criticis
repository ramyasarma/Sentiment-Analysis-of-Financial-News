The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority paid its top 10 executives a combined $11.6 million
last year amid criticism from member firms that the brokerage
industry watchdog’s managers are overpaid.  Chief Executive Officer  Richard Ketchum  received salary,
incentive pay and retirement benefits of $2.24 million, the
industry-funded regulator said today in its  annual report . Vice
Chairman  Stephen Luparello  received $1.26 million and Chief
Financial Officer  Todd Diganci  got $1.18 million, Finra said.  Finra, which previously disclosed the information only in
tax documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service, listed
management pay in the report after member firms in August
approved a non-binding measure seeking increased transparency.  The regulator’s pay practices drew scrutiny from members
after Finra lost $568 million on its investment portfolio during
the 2008 financial crisis. Amerivet Securities, a brokerage
based in Moreno Valley, California, sued Finra in August 2009,
questioning why executives got so much compensation at a time
when the watchdog was losing money.  The amount paid to executives last year is 52 percent less
than the $24 million the 10 highest-paid managers got in 2008.
The 2008 figure included more than $7 million of retirement
payouts to employees who left Finra that year, including  Elisse Walter , who was appointed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, and  Douglas Shulman , who left to head the IRS.
Former CEO  Mary Schapiro , now SEC chairman, received the biggest
payout, $3.26 million.  Reject Pay Packages  At Finra’s annual meeting in August, brokerage firms also
approved a proposal that would have given members the ability to
reject pay packages through a non-binding vote. Finra’s board
declined to adopt the measure.  “The board believed that it raised serious problems for
Finra because of its potential to create the perception that
regulated entities had the power to improperly intimidate
regulatory staff,” Ketchum wrote to brokerages on Sept. 28.  Under the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul enacted in July,
all U.S. publicly traded companies are required to give
investors a say-on-pay vote. Finra, which is overseen by the
SEC, is funded by the 5,000 U.S. brokerages it regulates.  Finra said it bases compensation on pay for executives at
brokerage firms, banks, insurers and other regulators.  Grace Vogel , Finra’s executive vice president of member regulation,
received $1.12 million in 2009 and  Howard Schloss , executive
vice president of corporate communications, got $977,075.  Ketchum’s salary will increase 26 percent to $1 million in
this year, and Luparello will get a 4.2 percent raise to
$600,000, according to the report. Diganci’s salary will be cut
3.6 percent to $500,000. The document doesn’t disclose expected
bonuses and retirement benefits for 2010.  Fines collected from brokerages that violated Finra rules
rose 84 percent to $47.6 million in 2009, according to the
annual report. The number of penalties increased 12 percent to
644, Finra said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
