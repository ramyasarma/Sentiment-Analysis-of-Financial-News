Corn fell in South Africa, the
largest producer of the grain on the continent, tracking Chicago
prices after the U.S. said pre-harvest inventories rose to the
highest level since 2006.  Corn for December delivery slipped as much as 1.8 percent
to $4.87 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and traded at
$4.875 at 9:14 a.m. Johannesburg time.  U.S. stockpiles were at 1.708 billion bushels as of Sept.

Agriculture said in a report yesterday.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, dropped 34 rand, or 2.7
percent, to 1,238 rand ($177) a metric ton. Meal made from the
grain is the country’s staple food.  Yellow corn for December delivery fell 32 rand, or 2.3
percent, to 1,335 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa.  Wheat for December delivery lost 16 rand, or 0.6 percent,
to 2,620 rand a ton.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
