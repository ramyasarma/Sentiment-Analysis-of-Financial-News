French daily newspapers  Le Figaro  and
Le Parisien today published a  picture  of the seven hostages
seized in Niger two weeks ago.  The image shows the hostages sitting on sand and surrounded
by armed men, whose faces are covered by turbans. It was
broadcast yesterday by the Al Jazeera television station, which
has also received a tape showing four of the five French
hostages being questioned, Le Figaro said.  The French foreign ministry said the photograph was “an
encouraging sign” and had been authenticated, although the date
on which it was taken is not known.  The hostages, five workers from Vinci SA’s Satom subsidiary
and one  Areva SA  employee and his wife, were kidnapped Sept. 16
in Arlit, near a uranium mine in northern Niger, the companies
have said. Five of the hostages are French, one is Togolese, and
one Madagascan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
