Chile’s peso gained for a ninth
straight day, the longest winning streak in 30 months, as the
price of copper reached a two-year high.  The peso jumped 0.7 percent to 480.45 per dollar at 10:47
a.m. New York time, from 483.55 yesterday. The currency rose for
11 days in the period through March 11, 2008. It has gained 1.3
percent this week.  Copper touched $3.72 a pound, the highest level since July
2008, and headed for a third straight weekly gain. Copper
accounts for 56 percent of Chile’s exports.  “The dollar is falling globally and copper keeps rising,
and the Chilean peso is highly correlated to copper,” said
 Flavio Magnasco , an economist at Banco Falabella in Santiago.
“The only thing that could stop this trend is central bank
intervention, and the market doesn’t expect that until 470 per
dollar, so we’ve got 10 pesos left to go.”  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
