Italian  joblessness  unexpectedly
declined in August as exports helped buoy the economic recovery.  The unemployment rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 8.2
percent from 8.4 percent in July, Rome-based national statistics
office Istat said today. That was lower than the median  forecast 
of 8.5 percent of six economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Italy’s economy expanded 0.5 percent in the second quarter
as exports rose 3.3 percent, helped by the euro’s 9 percent drop
against the dollar during the same period.  Consumer confidence 
increased unexpectedly in the country last month to the highest
since April as households grew optimistic about their finances
and the jobs outlook.  The $2.3 trillion  economy  will contract an annualized 0.3
percent in the third quarter, according to a Sept. 9 report by
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in
Paris. That estimate compares with a projected 1.1 percent
expansion in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, while the  French
economy  will grow 0.3 percent, the OECD said.  Italy’s inactivity rate, which measures the number of
unemployed who are not seeking work, rose to a seasonally
adjusted 37.9 percent in August, Istat said today. The number of
people actively looking for work fell by 2.4 percent.  The jobless rate will rise this year to 8.7 percent,
according to new forecasts release by the Finance Ministry this
week. Employers’ lobby  Confindustria  made the same forecast in a
report last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
