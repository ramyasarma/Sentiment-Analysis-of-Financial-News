Copper climbed to a 26-month high, on
track for a third weekly increase, as a weaker dollar boosted
the appeal of commodities as alternative investments.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.8 percent to $8,077 a metric ton, the
highest price since Aug. 1, 2008.  Copper on the Comex in New York advanced to $3.6790 a
pound, the highest level since April.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
