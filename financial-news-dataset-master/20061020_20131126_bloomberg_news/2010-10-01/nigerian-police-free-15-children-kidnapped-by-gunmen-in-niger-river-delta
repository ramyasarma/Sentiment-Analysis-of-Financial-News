Nigerian police rescued 15 children
who had been seized by gunmen in the south-eastern town of Aba
earlier this week, said  Yemi Ajayi , a police spokesman.  The children were freed yesterday near the oil-rich Niger
River delta, Ajayi said by phone today from Abuja, the capital.  “None of them was hurt,” he said.  The Nigerian army raided the camps used by the kidnappers
and arrested some of them, while others escaped, abandoning the
children, said Aminu Iliyasu, a major and spokesman for the
army. The operation will continue “until Aba and indeed, the
entire region is cleared of all forms of criminality,” Iliyasu
said in an interview in Port Harcourt, in Rivers state.  President Goodluck Jonathan condemned the kidnapping as
“utterly callous and cruel” and ordered the security services
to take all necessary steps to return the children to their
families, his office said in an e-mailed statement on Sept. 28.  The children have been taken to Umuahia, capital of Abia
state, Iliyasu said.  Kidnapping for ransom is common in Nigeria, Africa’s
biggest oil producer and most populous nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
