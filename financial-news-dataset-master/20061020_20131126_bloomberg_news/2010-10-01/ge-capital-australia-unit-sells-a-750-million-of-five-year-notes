General Electric Capital Australia
Funding Pty , a unit of General Electric Co.’s financing arm,
issued A$750 million ($727 million) of senior, unsecured bonds
in its first sale in the country in three years.  The 7 percent  notes  due in October 2015 were priced to
yield 7.14 percent, or 175 basis points more than the swap rate,
according to an e-mailed statement from National Australia Bank
Ltd., which helped manage the sale along with Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  The Melbourne-based unit last issued Australian dollar-
denominated bonds in the country in September 2007, selling
A$200 million of floating-rate notes, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
