CVR Energy Inc.  had an explosion late
yesterday at a nitrogen fertilizer plant near its Coffeyville,
Kansas, refinery, said  Steve Eames , a spokesman for the company.  “No one was injured and the refinery is business as
usual,” Eames said in a telephone interview today. “The
nitrogen fertilizer plant is in recovery mode now.”  The explosion occurred yesterday at about 6:30 p.m. local
time at the fertilizer plant, which is adjacent to the 120,000-
barrel-a-day refinery, he said. Non-essential refinery personnel
were evacuated for less than an hour, according to Eames.  The blast happened at the urea ammonium nitrate production
facility, Bob Roesky, a captain with the Coffeyville fire
department, said in a telephone interview.  “Although the incident was heard through the area
surrounding the plant, no impact was recorded beyond the fence
line,” Roesky said. The explosion is under investigation and no
damage estimate is immediately available, he said.  The Sugarland, Texas-based company’s refinery processes
crude oil from CVR’s owned and leased gathering system and via
pipeline from storage in Cushing, Oklahoma, according to the
company. CVR maintains capacity on the Spearhead pipeline, which
allows it to receive crude oil from Canada.  The refinery can process Canadian medium and heavy sour
crudes and sweet synthetics, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
