Boeing Co. , Loral Space &
Communications Inc. and Thales SA may seek to build two
satellites for Mexico’s space program, Communications and
Transportation Minister  Juan Molinar Horcasitas  said.  “The design is already approved and now we are in the final
phase to realize the bids for the acquisition,” Molinar said at
a hearing before members of the lower house of Congress. “It
would involve surely these three companies.”  Mexico is building its own satellite program for security
operations, replacing the work performed by closely held
Satelites Mexicanos SA, a money-losing former government agency
that failed to find a buyer earlier this year.  Molinar said today he is seeking approval from Congress for
5.74 billion pesos ($458 million) next year for the design,
construction and launch of the satellites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
