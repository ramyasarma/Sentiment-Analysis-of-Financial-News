Petroleo Brasileiro SA , the oil
producer that raised $70 billion last week in the world’s
largest stock sale, says Morgan Stanley exercised its right to
sell additional shares because of strong demand.  As part of the so-called green-shoe offer, Morgan Stanley
will distribute a supplementary over-allotment of 75.2 million
common shares and 112.8 million preferred shares, the company
said today in a regulatory filing. The shares are worth 5.2
billion reais ($3.1 billion), the company said.  Petrobras, as Brazil’s  state -controlled oil producer is
known, sold shares to help fund its $224 billion, five-year
investment plan, the global oil industry’s largest. The Rio de
Janeiro-based company aims to boost production to 5.38 million
barrels a day by 2020 by tapping deepwater fields, including the
Tupi find, the Americas’ biggest discovery in three decades.  Petrobras  rose 21 centavos, or 0.8 percent, to 27.50 reais
at 5:08 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading. The stock has lost 25 percent
this year, compared with a 2.4 percent gain for Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
