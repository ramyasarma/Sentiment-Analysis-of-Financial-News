India’s Supreme Court today sought a
response from  Ramalinga Raju , the former chairman of  Satyam
Computer Services Ltd. , on a petition filed by the federal
investigation agency seeking cancellation of his bail.  Raju admitted in January 2009 to overstating the Indian
software developer’s assets by $1 billion, triggering the
nation’s biggest corporate-fraud inquiry, a stock slump,
government takeover and the Hyderabad-based company’s eventual
sale to  Tech Mahindra Ltd.   The court fixed Oct. 12 to hear the Central Bureau of
Investigation’s petition for repealing Raju’s bail. He was
granted bail by the high court in the city of Hyderabad on Aug.
18 on the condition he stays in the city and paid 2 million
rupees ($45,000) as surety.  The prosecuting agency challenged the lower court’s order
in the Supreme Court, saying the bail would deter witnesses from
deposing against Raju.  Satyam Computer on Sept. 29 reported a narrower full-year
loss in its first annual earnings announcement in two years. The
net loss totaled 1.25 billion rupees ($28 million) in the 12
months ended March 31, from 81.8 billion rupees a year earlier,
Satyam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
