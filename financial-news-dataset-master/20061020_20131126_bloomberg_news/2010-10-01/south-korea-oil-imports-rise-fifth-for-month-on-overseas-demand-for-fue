South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest
crude buyer, increased oil imports for a fifth month as refiners
expanded output to meet overseas orders for fuel.  Imports rose to 74.3 million barrels last month from 68
million barrels a year earlier, the  Ministry of Knowledge
Economy  said in an e-mailed statement today.  SK Energy Co. , South Korea’s biggest refiner, processed
about 900,000 barrels a day last month, up from between 760,000
and 780,000 barrels a year earlier. The country’s oil-product
exports jumped 28 percent as overseas gasoline and jet fuel
demand gained, according to the ministry. Shipments to the U.S.
more than doubled, the ministry said.  South Korea’s crude import bill climbed 16 percent to $5.64
billion last month from a year earlier as Asian benchmark Dubai
prices advanced 11 percent to $75.20 a barrel, the government
said.  Petrochemical exports rose 7.1 percent by value from a year
earlier as higher crude costs pushed up the price of naphtha,
the raw material used to make plastics, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
