Liberia’s economy will probably
expand more than 6 percent in 2010 as rubber exports rebound,
the International Monetary Fund said.  Growth will accelerate from 4.5 percent in 2009, the
Washington-based lender said in a statement on its website.
Pledges on foreign direct investment “have increased sharply
following the ratification of several iron ore and palm oil
concession agreements,” the IMF said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
