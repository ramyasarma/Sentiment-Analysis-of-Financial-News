Bundesbank President Axel Weber
expects Germany’s 2010 combined budget deficit as a percentage
of gross domestic product to be less than the bank forecast
earlier this year.  This “more favorable development” is due to “the
improved economic dynamism,” Weber said in Brussels today.  The central bank expects the budget gap “not to be
significantly above 4 percent of GDP,” Bundesbank spokesman
Benedikt Fehr said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
