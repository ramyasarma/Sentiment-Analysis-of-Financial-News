India’s benchmark stock index rose,
extending its longest stretch of weekly gains in five months,
after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . raised the economic growth
estimate, citing the benefits of a better-than-forecast monsoon.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.  climbed to the highest in at least
19 years after saying monthly sales increased.  Maruti Suzuki
India Ltd. , the biggest carmaker, advanced the most in more than
a week after reporting monthly sales increased by a record. The
nation’s economy will expand 8.5 percent this year, Goldman
Sachs predicted.  “Consumer demand will remain strong,” said  P. Phani Sekhar , a fund manager at Angel Broking Ltd. in Mumbai.
“Foreign investors are finding India’s growth compelling.”
Sekhar, who declined to say how much he manages, said he’s
buying shares of Maruti Suzuki and  Reliance Industries Ltd. 
among others.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 375.92, or 1.9 percent, to 20,445.04. The gauge, at its
highest level since its January 2008 peak, completed a fifth
straight week of gains. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National
Stock Exchange rose 1.9 percent to 6,143.40. The  BSE 200 Index 
increased 1.9 percent to 2,579.38.  Maruti  Mahindra increased 3.5 percent to 715.75 rupees, its
highest close since at least January 1991. Vehicle sales climbed
24 percent last month, according to its e-mailed statement.
Maruti gained 2.7 percent to 1,479.95 rupees, its steepest gain
since Sept. 22. September sales climbed 30 percent to 108,008
vehicles, according to its e-mailed statement today.  “We expect Sensex company earnings to grow 20 percent to
22 percent in the September quarter,” Angel’s Sekhar said.
Angel Broking has been ranked by Dun & Bradstreet as the
brokerage with the biggest distribution network in the nation.
The nation’s largest companies begin reporting earnings for the
period from mid month.  India’s monsoon is set to be the best in three years,
according to data from the India Meteorological Department.
Goldman’s prediction for economic growth, increased from 8.2
percent, would be the fastest pace since 2008.  Reliance Industries, the most valuable company, increased
2.1 percent to 1,007.9 rupees.  ICICI Bank Ltd. , the country’s
second-biggest lender, rose 2 percent to 1,135.2 rupees  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the biggest copper and
zinc producer, jumped 5.1 percent to 175.35 rupees. India’s
highest court today said Sterlite can continue to operate its
only smelter until Oct. 18, when it will hear an appeal against
a Madras High Court order that the unit be closed.  Fund Flows  Sterlite, the best performer today on the 30-member Sensex,
also gained with commodity prices after manufacturing increased
in China, the world’s largest user of copper.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. , the biggest aluminum producer,
rose 3.7 percent to 204.35 rupees.  Tata Steel Ltd. , the biggest
producer of the alloy, added 2.5 percent to 667.8 rupees.  Foreign fund inflows to India’s equities have increased 50
percent this year, making the benchmark index the most expensive
in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include Brazil,
Russia and China.  Overseas  funds  bought a net  8.95 billion rupees  ($198.3
million) of Indian equities on Sept. 28, extending this year’s
record inflows to 843.6 billion rupees, according to the
