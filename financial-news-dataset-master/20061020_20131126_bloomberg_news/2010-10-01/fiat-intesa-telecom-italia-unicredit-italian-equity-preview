Italy’s benchmark FTSE MIB Index
declined 113.93, or 0.6 percent, to 20,391.27 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Milan. The gauge fell 1.1 percent this week.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Azimut Holding SpA  (AZM IM), Italy’s largest independent
fund manager, lost 1.3 percent to 7.12 euros as the Stoxx Europe
600 Index fell after a report showed growth in U.S.
manufacturing slowed in September, prompting speculation that
last month’s rally in equities has overshot the prospects for
economic growth.  Italcementi SpA  (IT IM) and  Buzzi Unicem SpA  (BZU IM),
Italy’s biggest cement makers, advanced 1.2 percent to 6.57
euros and 1.2 percent to 7.85 euros, respectively.  Construction spending in the U.S. rose unexpectedly in
August, led by an increase in government stimulus outlays for
public works that overcame a drop in homebuilding.  ERG SpA  (ERG IM) lost 4.1 percent to 9.5 euros, erasing
yesterday’s gain. Equita Sim SpA, which has a “buy” on the
stock, said “the issue of a convertible would be a surprise”
and considers it “unlikely,” after weekly Il Mondo reported
that ERG may be considering a 150 million-euro ($206 million) to
200 million-euro convertible bond issue.  Fondiaria-Sai SpA  (FSA IM) lost 1.4 percent to 7.31 euros
as Standard & Poor’s lowered to ‘BBB’ from ‘BBB+’ its long-term
counterparty credit and insurer financial strength ratings on
the insurance group.  Luxottica Group SpA  (LUX IM), the world’s biggest maker of
eyewear, ended a three-day gain falling 1.5 percent to 19.77
euros as companies with sales in the U.S. were affected by the
dollar dropping to the lowest level since March versus the euro.  Prysmian SpA  (PRY IM), the world’s second-biggest cable
maker, gained 1 percent to 13.53 euros as copper extended its
weekly gain.  Saipem SpA  (SPM IM), Europe’s largest oilfield-services
provider, gained 2.7 percent to 30.18 euros, the third increase
this week. Equita Sim, which has a “hold” rating on the stock,
said in a note that the “onshore construction market is still
very buoyant and bidding activity is intense.”  STMicroelectronics NV  (STM IM) lost 1.9 percent to 5.5
euros, the lowest in more than three weeks. Exane BNP Paribas
downgraded Europe’s biggest chipmaker to “neutral” from
“outperform.”  UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM) slid 2.1 percent to 1.83 euros. A
gauge for European banking stocks fell for a fifth straight day.  A statement issued after a meeting in Brussels on Oct. 1
said that finance ministers and central bank governors had
“pointed out the risks related to the sovereign debt market
that could have a contagious effect on the banking sector.”
 Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA  (UBI IM), Italy’s fourth-largest
bank, fell 1.1 percent to 7.04 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
