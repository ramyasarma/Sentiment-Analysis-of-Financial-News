After the economy slipped into
recession in 2008, millions of Americans received unemployment
benefits to make ends meet -- including almost 3,000
millionaires.  According to U.S. Internal Revenue Service  data , 2,840
households reporting at least $1 million in income on their tax
returns that year also collected a total of $18.6 million in
jobless aid. They included 806 taxpayers with incomes over $2
million and 17 with incomes in excess of $10 million. In all,
multimillionaires reported receiving $5.2 million in jobless
benefits.  Those numbers are a minuscule fraction of the 9.5 million
taxpayers who reported receiving $43.7 billion from jobless
benefits in 2008, up from 7.6 million recipients reporting $29.4
billion in benefits in 2007. Still, economists said they are
surprised so many people with seven-figure incomes claimed
benefits.  “It’s a larger number than I would have expected,” said
 Alan Viard , resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, a Washington research organization. “But, people at
any income level can lose their jobs.”  The first 26 weeks of unemployment benefits are paid by
states. Nationally, benefits average about $300 per week.
Because unemployment benefits are insurance, funded with taxes
paid by employers, the program isn’t need-based like welfare. A
millionaire who loses his or her job is entitled to benefits the
same as a laid-off factory or restaurant worker, Viard said.  An Insured Loss  “Getting an insurance payment doesn’t depend on need but
only on suffering an insured loss,” said Roberton Williams, a
senior fellow and expert on tax policy at the Urban Institute,
another Washington policy research organization. “We don’t say
that your homeowners’ policy shouldn’t pay off if you’re a
millionaire.”  Since 2008, the federal government has helped fund jobless
benefits beyond the 26 weeks that states pay. The federal aid is
scheduled to expire in November. It also lapsed in June and was
renewed in July following a battle in Congress, where some
lawmakers said it was time to wind down aid and Republicans said
it shouldn’t be financed with deficits.  Congress in 2009 voted to exempt the first $2,400 of
jobless benefits from federal income taxes. The Census Bureau
last month reported the country’s poverty rate rose to 14.3
percent in 2009, the highest level in 15 years.  In addition to the millionaires, 8,011 households reporting
income between $500,000 and $1 million in 2008 claimed jobless
benefits totaling $52.8 million, the IRS data show.  Few Millionaires  In 2007, so few millionaires collected jobless benefits
that the IRS said it refused to publish the data for fear their
identities could be detected in violation of confidentiality
laws. In 2006, nearly 2,000 households reporting more than $2
million in income claimed jobless benefits, including 15 with
incomes above $10 million.  No IRS data are available yet for 2009.  Williams said that in some cases where millionaires claim
benefits, the recipient may not be in a high-salary job. For
example, a chief executive’s spouse may lose a teaching job.  “The teacher may not need the money, but collecting the
benefits is different from a laid-off CEO collecting,” he said.  Still, Williams said the numbers remind him of stories he
heard earlier in his career about movie actors who collected
unemployment benefits between pictures.  “These were people comparable to your millionaires who
clearly didn’t need the money but collected it nonetheless,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
