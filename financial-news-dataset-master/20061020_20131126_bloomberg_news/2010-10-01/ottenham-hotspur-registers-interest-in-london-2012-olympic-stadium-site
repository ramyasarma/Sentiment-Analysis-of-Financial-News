English Premier League soccer club
Tottenham Hotspur said it had “registered an interest” in the
2012 Olympic Stadium site in east London.  “It is only prudent and good management that we ensure
that we investigate all possible options for the club,” Spurs
Chairman Daniel Levy said in a statement on the club’s website.
“We were informed by the Olympic Park Legacy Company that were
we not to register an interest at this time, there would not be
an opportunity at any future date.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
