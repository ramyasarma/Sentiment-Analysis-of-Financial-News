Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. , the
country’s biggest bank by outlets, and  Equity Bank Ltd.  have
been approved to offer agent banking, which brings financial
services to places that lack them, Kenya’s central bank said.  Kenya changed its banking laws in January to permit third-
party agents to represent commercial banks in dealing with
customers, the central bank said today in an e-mailed response
to questions. It said 5,892 agents have been registered.  The Nairobi-based bank is urging Kenyan commercial banks
"to consider utilizing these alternative channels in order to
reap the benefits of an increased customer base and reduce costs
of banking services,’’ the bank said in the statement.  Agent banking allows lenders to offer teller services at
locations such as supermarkets and fuel stations.  The bank didn’t say when Equity Bank and Kenya Commercial
Bank were approved to offer agent-banking services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
