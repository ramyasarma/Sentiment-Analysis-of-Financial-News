Hog futures fell to the lowest level
since March amid signs of lower U.S. demand and increasing pork
supplies. Cattle prices declined.  Yesterday,  hogs  for immediate delivery to slaughterhouses
fell to 77.29 cents a pound, the lowest level since Sept. 2,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. In the week ended
Sept. 25, animals slaughtered in the Iowa-southern Minnesota
region weighed 0.5 percent more than a year earlier, the agency
said.  “The recent weakness in the cash market is the big
negative today,” said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst at Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 2 cents, or 2.7
percent, to settle at 72.875 cents a pound at 1:09 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price touched 72.6
cents, the lowest level for a most-active contract since March
9. This week, the commodity dropped 4.7 percent, the most since
early August.  This year, hogs have climbed 11 percent.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 1.25 cents, or
1.3 percent, to settle at 98.35 cents a pound. The price has
gained 14 percent this year.  U.S. beef-export sales in week ended Sept. 23 fell 8.9
percent from the previous week, the USDA said yesterday.
Wholesale  choice-beef  prices declined 0.6 percent to $1.5428 a
pound at midday, the lowest level since Aug. 12. Spot-market
steers  sold  for 96.6 cents a pound in the first four days of
this week, down 1 percent from a week earlier.  “This week’s disappointing cash trade and the choice-beef
cutouts will be a limiting factor on live cattle,” Henderson
said.  Feeder Cattle  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement rose 0.25
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.12275 a pound. Earlier, the price
reached $1.12875, the highest level since Sept. 17. Yesterday,
the price climbed 2 percent, the biggest gain since March 18.
The commodity has climbed 17 percent in 2010.  Feeder cattle climbed on a “pretty good boost from the
weakness in the corn market,” Henderson said.  Corn futures had the biggest weekly drop since January. The
government said U.S. inventories before the harvest were at the
highest level in four years. Cheaper grain may encourage
feedlots to buy more animals and fatten them longer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
