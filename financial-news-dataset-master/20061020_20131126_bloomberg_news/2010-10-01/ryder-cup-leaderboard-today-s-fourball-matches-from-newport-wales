Following is the leaderboard for
fourball matches at the end of the first day of golf’s 38th
Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor in Newport, Wales:  NOTE: Today’s early matches are fourballs, when each member of a
two-man team plays their own ball. The team whose player has the
lowest score on that hole wins it. This afternoon’s matches are
foursomes, or alternate shot format in which each team plays one
ball. The team with the lowest score on that hole wins it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
