The koruna reached its strongest in
almost two years against the euro on speculation Czech interest
rates may rise sooner and as manufacturing growth accelerated.  The world’s best-performing currency last quarter advanced
0.8 percent to 24.377 per euro, its strongest intraday level in
22 months, at 10:55 a.m. in Prague.  Czech policy maker  Eva Zamrazilova  cast the first vote for
a rate increase on Sept. 23 after two years of cuts, minutes
from the central-bank meeting released today showed. A Czech
index of purchasing managers in manufacturing rose to 58 in
September, the highest in three years, HSBC Holdings Plc said
today.  “The minutes signaled an increasing likelihood of interest
rates growing in the horizon of the next six months,” said
 David Sykora , senior currency trader at  CSOB AS , the Prague-
based unit of  KBC Groep NV .  Stocks in emerging markets rallied for a third day as a
Chinese manufacturing PMI rose, adding to signs growth in the
Asian country is picking up after slowing in the second quarter.
The gauge rose to 53.8 from 51.7 a month earlier, beating all 15
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  In Poland, a manufacturing gauge jumped to 54.7, its
highest since 2006 and beating the median survey estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
