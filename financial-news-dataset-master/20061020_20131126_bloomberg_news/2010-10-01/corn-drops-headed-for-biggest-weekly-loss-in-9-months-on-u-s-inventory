Corn declined for a second day in
Chicago, set for the biggest weekly slide in almost nine months,
after U.S. pre-harvest stockpiles rose to the highest level
since 2006.  December-delivery corn dropped 1.4 percent to $4.8875 a
bushel at 2:15 p.m. Paris time on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The grain has fallen 6.3 percent this week, the biggest retreat
for a most-active contract since the week ended Jan. 15.  Corn  inventories  from last year’s harvest were at 1.708
billion bushels (43.4 million metric tons) as of Sept. 1, up
from 1.673 billion bushels a year earlier, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture reported yesterday. Analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey forecast an average of 1.407 billion bushels.  “The USDA’s corn-stocks data was bearish, coming well
above expectations,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a
report e-mailed today. “This therefore implies that U.S. corn
demand fell significantly in the three months to September.”  December-delivery wheat lost 0.6 percent to $6.70 a bushel.
The grain has slid 6.9 percent this week, the most since the
week ended May 14. The most-active contract rose 40 percent in
the third quarter, the largest gain in three years.  Wheat Stockpiles  Inventories of all wheat in the U.S., the world’s largest
exporter, totaled 2.46 billion bushels as of Sept. 1, up 11
percent from a year earlier, the USDA said yesterday.  “For the grains, the USDA’s stocks-in-positions report
yesterday was a manifest killer,” economist  Dennis Gartman  said
in his daily newsletter.  The U.S. will harvest 2.224 billion bushels of wheat in the
marketing year that began June 1, the USDA said yesterday in a
separate report. That’s 1.8 percent less than the agency
estimated on Sept. 10.  Milling wheat for November delivery fell 0.5 percent to 207
euros ($284.17) a ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris. Prices are down
7.6 percent this week.  Soybeans for November delivery declined 0.7 percent to
$10.9925 a bushel in Chicago. The contract has dropped 2.4
percent this week, the most in six weeks.  Exporters in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and
exporter of the oilseed, sold 1.74 million tons in the week to
Sept. 23, up from 1.08 million tons a week earlier, the USDA
said in a separate report yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
