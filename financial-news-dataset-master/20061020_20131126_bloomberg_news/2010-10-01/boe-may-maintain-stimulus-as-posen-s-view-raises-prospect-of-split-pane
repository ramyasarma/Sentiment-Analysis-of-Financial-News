The Bank of England will probably
keep its stimulus program at the current level of 200 billion
pounds ($316 billion) next week to aid economic growth in a
decision which may further split the Monetary Policy Committee.  Policy makers will leave the value of their bond holdings
unchanged on Oct. 7, according to the median forecast of 36
economists in a  Bloomberg News survey  finished yesterday. The
bank will also maintain its benchmark interest rate at a record
low of 0.5 percent, all 60 economists in a separate survey said.  The decision may produce the first three-way split in
almost a year after policy maker  Adam Posen  advocated an
expansion of stimulus and  Andrew Sentance  kept up his campaign
for an interest-rate increase. British Chambers of Commerce
Chief Economist  David Kern  this week backed Posen’s position,
saying that all the evidence points to slowing economic growth.  “What you might see, certainly on the basis of Adam
Posen’s speech, is one person starting to vote for an expansion
to the asset-purchase facility,”  Peter Dixon , an economist at
Commerzbank AG in London, said in a telephone interview. “The
headwinds facing the U.K. as we enter the fourth quarter remain
quite significant.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
