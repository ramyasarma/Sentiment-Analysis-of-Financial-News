South Africa’s world champion rugby
team will wear the Springbok emblem on the sleeves of their
jerseys when they defend their title at the World Cup in New
Zealand next year,  Sport24  reported, without citing anyone.  The badge, which depicts the leaping antelope, will be
moved to comply with World Cup and government regulations, the
news website said. South Africa’s government requires the  King
Protea , the national flower and official sporting symbol, to be
worn on the left breast while tournament rules stipulate that
the World Cup logo be worn on the right breast, Sport24 said.  The  South African Rugby Union  is expected to announce the
decision when it unveils a supporter’s version of the World Cup
jersey later today, Sport24 said.  The Springbok, which has been the emblem of South African
rugby since 1906, was used by the nation’s sporting codes during
apartheid in which teams were almost uniformly whites-only. The
symbol was retained by the national rugby team after the advent
of democracy in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
