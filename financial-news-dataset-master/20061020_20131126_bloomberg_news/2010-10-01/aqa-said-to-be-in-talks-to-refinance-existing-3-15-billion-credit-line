Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. , the
state-run utility known as Taqa, is in talks with banks to raise
about $3 billion of loans to refinance an existing credit line,
according to four people with knowledge of the negotiations.  Taqa is seeking a facility of three to five years, said two
of the people, who declined to be identified because the
discussions are private. The company has not yet hired banks,
according to the people.  Proceeds will replace a $3.15 billion revolving credit that
matures next year, the people said.  Allan Virtanen, an Amsterdam-based spokesman for Taqa,
confirmed that the company has started the process of
refinancing. He declined to comment on the timing or costs.  The deal Taqa is seeking to refinance, which was signed in
2008, paid an interest rate of 65 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Libor is the rate banks charge to lend to each other.  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Barclays Capital, BNP
Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
and National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC were bookrunners on that
deal, Bloomberg data show. Money in a revolving credit can be
borrowed again once it’s been repaid. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Taqa is ranked A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, the seventh
highest rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
