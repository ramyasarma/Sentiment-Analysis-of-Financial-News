             Limited Brands Inc. (LTD) , the owner of
the Victoria's Secret lingerie chain, forecast long-term same-store sales growth of 3 percent to 5 percent.  
 The retailer seeks to increase earnings per share by 12
percent annually, Chief Financial Officer Stuart Burgdoerfer
said today during a meeting with investors and analysts in
Columbus,  Ohio , where Limited Brands is based.  
 Earlier this year the retailer sold the Express and
Limited apparel chains, where sales had dropped the past three
years, to concentrate on Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body
Works, which sells lotion and shampoo. The two divisions
provided 72 percent of  revenue  last year and almost all of the
company's profit.  
 Sales at stores open at least a year increased 2 percent
for the 35 weeks ended Oct. 6,  Limited Brands  said last week.  
 Limited Brands, which also operates La Senza and the White
Barn Candle Co., fell 21 cents to $22.03 as of 10 a.m. in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had declined
23 percent this year before today.
