             Saks Inc. (SKS)  rose the most in almost a
month in  New York  trading after a Citigroup Inc. analyst said
the luxury retailer might be taken over by a buyout firm.  
 ``We would not rule out the potential acquisition of
Saks,''  Deborah Weinswig , a Citi Investment Research analyst,
said today in a note. She named New York private-equity firm
Cerberus Capital Management LP, French luxury-goods maker PPR SA
and Icelandic retailer Baugur Group Hf as possible buyers.  
 Saks  climbed  95 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $19.67 at 4:03
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading for the
biggest gain since Sept. 18. The shares are up 10 percent this
year.  
 Saks spokeswoman Julia Bentley, Cerberus spokesman  Peter Duda , Doug Donsky, a New York-based spokesman for Baugur, and
Catherine Malek, a PPR spokeswoman in Paris, all declined to
comment when contacted today.  
 Recognition of the Saks brand and past licensing agreements
in  Saudi Arabia  and the  United Arab Emirates  are why
``international private equity interest makes sense,'' Weinswig
wrote. The analyst estimates a 60 percent chance of a takeover.
Her previous prediction put the odds at 50 percent.  
 `Resilient' Customers  
 New York-based Saks's ownership of more than half its Saks
Fifth Avenue stores, improvement in the retailer's sales and
margins, and its focus on ``a fairly resilient luxury
consumer,'' make Saks an attractive takeover target, John Lahman, a fixed income analyst with KDP Investment Advisors Inc.
in Montpelier,  Vermont , wrote in an Oct. 15 report.  
 Women's Wear Daily reported yesterday that Saks was
approached by at least one suitor in the past two weeks and may
consider accepting an offer.  
 Saks operates 54 Saks Fifth Avenue stores, 31 of which it
owns. It also runs 49 Saks Off Fifth stores and 87 Club Libby Lu
shops that cater to pre-teen girls, with 25 of them within
department stores. It had sales of $2.94 billion in the year
ended Feb. 3.
