             Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) , maker of
the BlackBerry e-mail phone, will see a rush of holiday sales
this season as consumer purchases accelerate, Co-Chief Executive
Officer James Balsillie said.  
 ``That's kind of a shift that's happening right now,''
Balsillie said in an interview today at the company's
headquarters in Waterloo, Ontario. ``We have a number of
carriers around the world and certainly in  North America  who are
planning very aggressive holiday campaigns.''  
 Balsillie introduced designs with Web browsers, cameras and
music players to appeal to consumers and fend off a challenge
from  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 's iPhone. Small businesses and consumers
accounted for more than half of new North American subscribers
for the first time last quarter.  
 The company said Oct. 4 it expects to add 1.65 million
subscribers in the third quarter, which runs through November.
That's up from 1.45 million added in the previous quarter, which
ended Sept. 1.  
 ``If we cross over to that holiday gift positioning, which
would be a big extension for us, that would be very, very
positive,'' Balsillie said.  
 Research In Motion  shares  gained $1.91, or 1.7 percent, to
$112 in extended trading. They added 38 cents to $110.09 at 4
p.m.  New York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The stock has
more than doubled this year.  
 Balsillie's Challenge  
 Balsillie, 46, who has run the company as co-CEO since
1992, managed to maintain growth amid competition from the
iPhone, which went on sale June 29, and e-mail devices from
Nokia Oyj and Motorola Inc.  
 The BlackBerry benefited as the iPhone drew attention to
mobile phones with advanced functions, Balsillie said. Those
looking for a cheaper device from AT&T Inc., which is selling
the $399 iPhone exclusively in the U.S., or other carriers are
choosing a BlackBerry.  
 ``It's driven a lot of sales for us,'' Balsillie said,
adding ``we had record months, record weeks'' after the iPhone's
introduction.  
 Research In Motion's second-quarter profit more than
doubled to $287.7 million and the company's forecast beat
analysts' estimates. Sales more than doubled to $1.37 billion in
the period ended Sept. 1.  
 The company benefited from demand for the $200 BlackBerry
Curve, introduced in May as part of a plan to reach beyond
corporate customers.  
 Music Player  
 The device has a music and video player, and a camera of
similar quality to the one in the iPhone. The Curve is the
company's smallest and lightest device with a full keyboard. It
sells with a two-year contract.  
 The handset follows the debut of the Pearl, a smaller
BlackBerry device without a full keyboard that was introduced a
year ago. A new Pearl is scheduled to go on sale in November.  
 To lift consumer sales further, the company is selling new
software that lets small businesses and families access programs
on their computers, the same way enterprise customers access
data through larger server computers, Balsillie said. The
company will also seek more partnerships with content companies.  
 ``We're doing a lot of social networking,'' he said.
``We're doing a lot of multimedia.''  
 Consumers will probably account for half the company's
subscribers in 2009, an increase from about 30 percent in the
second quarter, according to Maynard Um, an analyst at UBS AG in
New York with a ``buy'' rating on the stock.  
 Apple CEO  Steve Jobs  stepped up competition in September by
cutting prices on the iPhone by $200 from $599. The device,
which combines Apple's iPod music player with a Web-surfing
handset, reached sales of 1 million units in its first 74 days,
Apple said.  
 In a similar move, another competitor, Palm Inc., will
start selling a new model, the $99 Centro, this month. That's
the cheapest e-mail phone by Sunnyvale, California-based Palm so
far.
