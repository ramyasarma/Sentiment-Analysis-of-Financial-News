             OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel (MAGN) ,
 Russia 's third-largest steelmaker, lifted the capacity of a
project in  Turkey  by 27 percent and increased its cost to $1.7
billion to take advantage of growing demand.  
 The Magnitogorsk-based steelmaker has raised the cost of the
joint venture with Turkish coal trader Atakas Group from $1.1
billion, spokeswoman Yelena Azovtseva said today by mobile phone.  
 Magnitogorsk this year made its first overseas investment by
setting up the venture to build a steel plant with production
sites in Istanbul and the southern province of Iskenderun.
Turkish steel use rose by an average of 15 percent a year in the
past seven years, outpacing production growth of 8 percent.  
 The project, to be commissioned in three years, will produce
3.05 million tons of hot- and cold-rolled flat steel, 27 percent
more than originally planned, Magnitogorsk said in an e-mailed
statement today. It will also produce 900,000 tons of galvanized
coil and 400,000 tons of color-coated products.  
 The steelmaker will also build a port in Iskenderun for raw-
material supplies and product shipments. Italy's Danieli SpA will
supply equipment for the plant, Magnitogorsk said in the
statement, without providing the contract's value.  
 Some of the raw materials for the Turkish plant will come
from Magnitogorsk, the company said.
