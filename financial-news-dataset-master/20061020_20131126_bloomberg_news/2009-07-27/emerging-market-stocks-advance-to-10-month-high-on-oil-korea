             Emerging-market stocks climbed to
the highest in 10 months as rising commodity prices boosted
energy producers and  consumer confidence  in South Korea jumped
to the highest in seven years.  
 Russia’s  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rallied 0.9 percent, led by a 7.5
percent gain in Potash producer OAO Uralkali. Oil producers rose
as crude climbed for a ninth day to $68.38 a barrel. Hynix
Semiconductor Inc., the world’s second-largest computer-memory
chipmaker, increased to a nine-month high as South Korea’s
consumer sentiment index climbed to the best level since the
third quarter of 2002. Brazil’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  index rose to the
highest level in almost 11 months.  
 The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  added 1.2 percent to
833.66, the highest close since Sept. 25. The benchmark of
equities in 22 developing nations gained 75 percent since March
3 on speculation the worst of the global recession has passed.  
 In eastern  Europe , Latvia’s 34-member OMX Riga stock index
rose the most in more than seven months, leading gains in the
world’s biggest equity gauges, after the country received a
second loan installment from the European Commission of 1.2
billion euros ($1.7 billion).  
 The benchmark index climbed 4.3 percent to 267.94 even as
Latvia’s biggest coalition government member said it may refuse
to sign a letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund,
which helped provide the country’s 7.5 billion-euro
international stabilization program.  
 The Bovespa rose 0.2 percent to 54,548.99. Votorantim
Celulose e Papel SA and Vale SA led a rally in paper and metals
makers. Gafisa SA rose to its highest level since September
after Banco Santander SA said the company’s sales outlook is
improving.  
 Emerging-market bonds rose, with the  extra yield  investors
demand to own developing nations’ bonds instead of U.S.
Treasuries narrowing six basis points to 3.80 percentage points,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI+ Index. A basis point
equals 0.01 percentage point.
