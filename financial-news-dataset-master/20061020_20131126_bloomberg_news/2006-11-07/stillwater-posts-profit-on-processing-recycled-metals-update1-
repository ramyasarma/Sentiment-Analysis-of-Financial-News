             Stillwater Mining Co. (SWC) , the only U.S.
producer of palladium and platinum, had its most profitable
quarter in two years as prices of recycled metals rose and
processing increased.  
 Profit was $6.86 million, or 7 cents a share, Billings,
Montana-based Stillwater said today in a statement. A year earlier,
it had a loss of $9.11 million, or 10 cents a share.  
 Revenue rose 51 percent to $180.8 million as proceeds from
processing recycled metals jumped fourfold to $104.2 million.
Platinum and palladium are used in catalytic converters to control
air pollution. The metals also are used in jewelry.  
 Stillwater ``has been recycling increasing volumes of spent
platinum-group metal from automotive catalytic converters and
petroleum refiners,'' Chief Executive Officer Francis R. McAllister
said in the statement. ``The impressive growth in demand for
palladium jewelry, beginning about 30 months ago primarily in
 China ,'' has become broader based, he said.  
 Shares of Stillwater rose 7 cents to $11.44 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. They had climbed 22 percent in the past
year.  
 Stillwater processed 90,000 ounces of recycled metals through
its smelter and refinery, more than double from a year ago. It said
it expects the volume for this year to exceed 325,000 ounces,
compared with about 203,000 ounces last year.  
 Higher Selling Prices  
 Stillwater sold palladium 4.2 percent higher at an average
$370 an ounce, and platinum at $877 an ounce, up 7 percent. The
average palladium price in New York rose 74 percent to $327.37
during the quarter while platinum averaged $1,224.91, up 36
percent. Stillwater had locked in palladium and platinum prices in
forward contracts to automakers.  
 Production rose 18 percent to 151,300 ounces during the third
quarter. The company has two mines that stretch over 28 miles (45
kilometers) in  Montana 's Beartooth Mountains.  
 Wildfires in September led the company to close both mines
briefly as a precaution. Stillwater estimates the total lost
production for 2006 due to the closures at between 7,000 and 10,000
ounces.  
 ``Because mine production generally has been strong this year,
this lost output has not resulted in any change to the company's
production guidance for 2006,'' McAllister said. ``But the loss is
expected to reduce fourth-quarter earnings modestly.''  
 Cash costs fell 26 percent to $245 an ounce.  
 ``The company does not expect the third-quarter level of total
cash costs to be sustainable at current production rates, although
total cash costs may likely come in lower than the company's
earlier guidance of $300 to $315 per ounce for the full year
2006,'' McAllister said.
