             Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813) ,
controlled by  China 's fifth-richest man Xu Rongmao, hired  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to sell $500 million of bonds,
the company said in a statement.  
 Shimao plans to meet investors on Nov. 9 in Singapore,
before moving to Hong Kong and the U.S. next week, said a person
with knowledge of the deal, who declined to be named. The Hong
Kong-listed company will use as much as $160 million from the
sale to repay existing debt and the remainder to buy land and
build new projects, according to the statement.  
 The Shanghai-based developer joins rivals such as Greentown
China Holdings Ltd. and Agile Property Holdings Ltd. in selling
dollar bonds.  
 Property prices in China have more than doubled since 2000.
Real-estate investment grew 24.3 percent in the first nine months
of the year to 1.29 trillion  yuan  ($164 billion), according to
the National Development and Reform Commission.  
 The bond sale ``represents a timely opportunity for the
company to raise additional funds for the operation, and further
expansion, of the group's property development business'' in
China, Shimao said in the statement.  
 The company currently has 18 projects in Beijing, Shanghai,
Harbin, Fuzhou, Wuhan and Yantai, it said.  
 The developer plans to sell at least $200 million of 10-year
fixed-rate notes and at least $200 million of five-year fixed-
rate or floating-rate securities, said the person. Shimao
Chairman Xu wasn't immediately available to comment.  
 The company's first-half profit more than doubled to 703.6
million yuan from 305.8 million yuan a year earlier, after sales
surged to 2.2 billion yuan from 181.5 million yuan. At the end of
September, it had 1 billion yuan of short-term debt and 2.6
billion yuan of long-term borrowings, according to the statement.  
 Its stock has gained 68 percent since an initial share sale
in  Hong Kong  that raised HK$3.72 billion ($478 million) in July.
The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose 16 percent during the period.
