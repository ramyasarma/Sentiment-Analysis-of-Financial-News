             Pursuit Dynamics Plc, a U.K. developer
of a mist spray used in fire extinguishing systems, said  Tyco
International Ltd. (TYC)  is preparing to use the technology in its
products, sending Pursuit stock to its biggest gain in almost
eight months.  
 Tyco, the world's biggest provider of fire and security
systems, said arrangements for Pursuit's FireMist technology are
``well under way,'' pending third-party approval ``in the near
future,'' according to a statement by Pursuit Dynamics today.  
 Shares of Royston, England-based Pursuit advanced 35.5
pence, or 13 percent, to 312 pence in London, their biggest one-day gain since Dec. 7.  
 Pursuit licensed the mist technology to Tyco in 2005 for the
development of products to replace conventional sprinkler
systems. Pursuit has said it expects royalty revenue from Tyco in
December of this year.  
 The  unprofitable  company had sales of 1.22 million pounds
($2.5 million) for the six months ending March 31. Pursuit shares
have almost tripled this year, boosting the company's market
value to 180.4 million pounds.
