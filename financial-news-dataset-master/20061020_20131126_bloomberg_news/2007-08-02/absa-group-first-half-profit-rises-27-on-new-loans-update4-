             Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , a unit of  Barclays
Plc (BARC) , said first-half earnings rose 27 percent as it won customers
and demand for loans increased.  
 Profit increased to 4.36 billion rand ($614 million), or
6.10 rand a share, in the six months ended June 30, Johannesburg-based Absa,  South Africa 's biggest consumer bank, said in a stock
exchange statement today. That compares with 3.45 billion rand,
or 4.87 rand a share, a year earlier. Per-share earnings, excluding
one-time gains and losses, rose 25 percent to 6.10 rand.  
 ``They still seem to be growing at a good pace,'' said
Faizal Moolla, a bank analyst at Cape Town-based Metropolitan Asset
Management, which manages the equivalent of about $11 billion,
including Absa shares. The retail-banking unit ``is maintaining its
momentum. Impairment charges remain within acceptable levels.''  
 Economic growth of almost 5 percent is spurring business
borrowing, boosting Absa's corporate and investment-banking units.
Rising wealth among the nation's black majority also has pushed up
demand for cars and homes. Five interest-rate increases since last
June failed to slow  consumer spending .  
 ``Consumer spending has remained buoyant, driven by a growth
in the middle class, and has led to increased levels of
indebtedness,'' Absa said. ``Increased debt-financing costs and
lower real disposable income growth rates are, however, expected to
slow consumer-debt accumulation in coming months.''  
 The shares fell 2 rand, or 1.5 percent, to 131 rand in
Johannesburg, valuing the company at 88.4 billion rand. They have
gained 31 percent over the past 12 months.  
 Loans Increase  
 Absa's loans and advances rose 20 percent to 416 billion rand,
while net interest income advanced 25 percent to 8.6 billion rand.
Impairment losses rose to 0.49 percent of total loans and advances
from 0.37 percent.  
 ``We have grown our customer base by 8.4 percent to 8.8
million,'' Chief Executive Officer Steve Booysen told analysts in
Johannesburg. ``We see a tough environment in store for retail
banking. There will be a big focus on diversification of revenue
streams and earnings.''  
 The company increased its first-half dividend 15 percent to
2.40 rand a share. Its cost-to-income ratio fell to 53.6 percent
from 57.7 percent in the year-ago period.  
 Absa will open 115 new outlets by year-end and hire more staff
as it expands in its home market, where it expects the economy to
grow between 4 percent and 5.5 percent over the next year. Absa has
also agreed to buy Barclays' sub-Saharan African units.  
 ``The first steps have been taken in our endeavor to acquire
at least one of the sub-Saharan African country assets of Barclays
in 2007,'' Booysen said. He declined to name the unit.
