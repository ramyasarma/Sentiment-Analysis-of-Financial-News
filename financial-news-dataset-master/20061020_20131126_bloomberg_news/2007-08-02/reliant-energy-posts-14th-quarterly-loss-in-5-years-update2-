             Reliant Energy Inc., the largest
 Texas  electricity retailer, posted its 14th quarterly loss in
less than five years because energy contracts dropped in value
and cool weather cut power demand. Shares rose after the company
raised its earnings targets for the next two years.  
 The second-quarter loss was $283 million, or 83 cents a
share, compared with profit of $14.2 million, or 5 cents, a year
earlier, the Houston-based company said today in a statement.
Revenue fell 4.5 percent to $2.65 billion.  
 Reliant cut its forecast for 2007 profit before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization to $1.01 billion from $1.03
billion. The measure, called ``open EBITDA,'' doesn't include
such items as adjustments to the valuation of energy contracts,
which reduced second-quarter earnings by $326 million.  
 Open EBITDA in the second quarter fell 25 percent to $193
million as cool weather sapped demand for power to run air
conditioners. The average temperature in Texas was 70.2 degrees
Fahrenheit (21 Celsius). That was down 5.5 degrees from a year
earlier, when the state had its hottest second-quarter weather
in 100 years, according to the National Climatic Data Center.  
 Reliant raised its 2008 open EBITDA forecast to $1.42
billion from $1.26 billion and its 2009 projection to $1.49
billion from $1.18 billion.  
 Shares of Reliant rose $1.42, or 5.3 percent, to $28.12 in
 New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has almost
doubled in value this year.  
 Hedging Contracts  
 Second-quarter results included $71 million in costs for
early debt retirement. The contract adjustments are costs and
gains that Reliant records each quarter so the valuation of its
hedging instruments will reflect current market prices for power
and the fuel used in producing it.  
 The adjustments, which represent a snapshot of what losses
or gains would be if the energy contracts were immediately
liquidated, are hypothetical. Reliant locks in profits through
agreements that fix fuel costs and the prices the company will
be paid for power. The power producer had a $52 million gain on
the contracts in last year's second quarter.  
 Profit from retail power sales fell 47 percent to $126
million, Reliant said.  
 ``The retail contribution was lower due to lower margins
and volumes, and I think a lot of that had to do with milder
weather,'' said  Michael Worms , an analyst at BMO Capital Markets
in New York who rates Reliant shares at ``market perform'' and
doesn't own any.  
 Wholesale Power Gains  
 Earnings from plants that sell power in wholesale markets
more than doubled to $118 million.  
 The average wholesale electricity price in PJM
Interconnection LLC, the largest U.S. power market, rose 22
percent from a year earlier to about $74.58 a megawatt-hour,
according to Bloomberg data. Reliant has about 16,000 megawatts
of electric generating capacity, including more than 7,000
megawatts in the PJM region.  
 Mark Jacobs replaced Joel Staff, who retired as Reliant's
chief executive officer in May. Staff shed assets and cut jobs
to reduce costs and debt. The company had losses of more than
$2.5 billion from 2002 to 2006.
