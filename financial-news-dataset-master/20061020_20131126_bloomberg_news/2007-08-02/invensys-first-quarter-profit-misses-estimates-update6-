             Invensys Plc (ISYS) , the maker of controls
that help run refineries and Whirlpool washing machines, reported
first-quarter profit below analyst estimates after spending more
on marketing and hiring. The shares fell the most since 2005.  
 Net income  for the three months through June was 27 million
pounds ($54.8 million), compared with a loss of 35 million pounds
a year earlier, London-based Invensys said today. The company was
expected to earn 32 million pounds on sales of 623 million
pounds, according to the average estimates of seven analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Sales rose 3.8 percent to 621 million pounds as Invensys
raised prices at its controls division to help offset rising raw
material prices and a housing slump in the U.S., where the
company gets one-third of its revenue. Conditions aren't expected
to improve there this year and Invensys said it will have to hike
prices to keep profit growing.  
 ``They missed the market consensus for operating income by
around 4 percent and are 10 percent below our estimates. That gap
is coming from the process operation,'' said  Ben Uglow , a Morgan
Stanley analyst who has an ``overweight'' rating on Invensys.  
 The stock plunged 38.25 pence, or 10 percent, to close at
341.75 pence, the most since April 2005. Invensys shares were the
second-largest decliner in  Europe .  
 Share Performance  
 The  stock  has gained 24 percent this year because of rising
demand for processing technology in the energy and chemicals
industries and speculation that the company may be bought.  
 The stock advanced as much as 6 percent June 18 on
speculation that Siemens AG may make a takeover offer. Siemens
spokesman Konstanze Tauber on June 18 declined to comment.  
 ``I have seen the reports,'' Chief Executive Officer Ulf Henriksson said today on a conference call with reporters. ``We
have not been approached.''  
 Sales at the company's rail business rose 21 percent to 147
million pounds after a strong increase in demand in the U.K.,
 Spain  and  Australia , the company said today.  
 The company ``remains confident'' that it will make further
progress in the current financial year, Henriksson said.  
 Henriksson said he wanted to increase  operating margins  at
the company's process business to between 13 and 14 percent for
the year from 11.5 percent in the first quarter.  
 Operating profit at the division was flat at 20 million
pounds on sales that were little changed at 174 million pounds.
Earnings were crimped by investment in research and development
and in sales and marketing, with an additional 10 percent
increase in employee numbers from the previous year.  
 Invensys also put in place a new SAP AG software ordering
system which caused some short-term delays in shipments,
invoicing and cash collections at the unit, the company said.
