             Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd., a unit
of  Taiwan 's  Fubon Financial Holding Co. (2881) , agreed to buy into
Xiamen City Commercial Bank, the first such purchase since the
island starting letting its lenders buy into their mainland peers.  
 The acquisition of a 19.99 percent stake for 230 million
 yuan  ($33 million) will help Fubon better serve customers in
 China , Fubon Bank said in a Hong Kong exchange filing today.
Fubon Bank will also forgo 20 million yuan in dividends, to be
paid to the other shareholders, the statement said.  
 The announcement comes after Taiwan's government in March
said the island's banks, to become more competitive, could start
buying stakes of as large as 20 percent in their mainland peers
through third-country subsidiaries.  
 The investment will let Fubon Bank serve more than 5,300
Hong Kong- and Taiwan-owned businesses in Xiamen, ``an attractive
ready customer base for the company's business development,'' the
Hong Kong-based company said in the statement.  
 Fubon Financial Holding in April won an approval to buy the
stake in Xiamen City, paving the way for the first investment in
a Chinese bank by a Taiwanese financial company.  
 Taiwan restricts direct investment in China, which considers
the island part of its territory and has threatened to invade if
Taiwan declares formal independence.  
 Fubon Bank  Hong Kong  fell 5.4 percent to HK$7.15 today,
before the statement.
