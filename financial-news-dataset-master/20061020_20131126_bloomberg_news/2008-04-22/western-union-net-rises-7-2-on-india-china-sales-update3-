             Western Union Co. (WU) , the biggest U.S.
money-transfer business, said first-quarter profit rose 7.2
percent as the company expanded in India and China.  
 Net income  climbed to $207.1 million, or 27 cents a share,
in the period ended March 31, from $193.2 million, or 25 cents,
in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue advanced 12 percent
to $1.27 billion, the Englewood, Colorado-based company said
today in a statement.  
 Chief Executive Officer Christina Gold is expanding
operations in Asia as sales growth declines in  North America 
because of a slowing economy and concerns over immigration from
Mexico to the U.S. Revenue climbed 52 percent in India and 35
percent in China. The two countries contribute 6 percent of the
company's revenue.  
 ``International emerging markets, specifically China and
India, will soon eclipse Mexico in size,'' said analyst John Kraft of D.A. Davidson & Co. in an interview before the earnings
release. Kraft rates the shares ``buy'' and does not own any.
``At some point, people will say Mexico is a `so what?'''  
 Western Union climbed 84 cents to $22 at 4:01 p.m. in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The company fell 9.4
percent this year to date.

 Revenue climbed 1 percent in Mexico where the company faced
competition from  Coinstar Inc. (CSTR)  and  Euronet Worldwide Inc. (EEFT) , Kraft
said.  
 Transfers between the U.S. and Mexico ``are still bad, but
it's stable,'' said Larry Berlin, an analyst at First Analysis
Corp.  
 Western Union operates from more than 50,000 locations in
India, with brand awareness of ``well over 75 percent,'' Gold
said in a conference call today. She said the company had
partnered with  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India's largest mobile-phone
operator, to provide transfer services allowing money to be sent
within the country.  
 Western Union recorded $24.2 million in first-quarter costs
as it cut 650 jobs in March, or about 10 percent of the
 workforce , and closed offices in Missouri and Texas. Profit
excluding the cost of closing the offices was 29 cents a share,
beating the 28-cent  estimate  of 22 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. A survey of 15 analysts estimated revenue of $1.24
billion for the quarter.  
 Western Union reiterated its 9 percent to 11 percent revenue
growth projection for 2008 and raised its forecast for annual
earnings to as much as $1.29 a share from as much as $1.28
previously, excluding $69 million of full-year restructuring
costs.  
 Global remittances probably grew at the slowest pace in at
least five years in 2007, the  World Bank  said in a November
report. Money transfers to Mexico are expected to rise 1.4
percent after advancing at a 20 percent annual rate since 2002,
India and China are the only countries that receive more
remittances than Mexico, according to the report.
