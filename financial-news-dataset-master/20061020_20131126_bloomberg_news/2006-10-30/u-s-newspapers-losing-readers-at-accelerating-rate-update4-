             U.S. daily newspapers are losing
readers at an accelerating rate, led by big-city publications
such as the Miami Herald and Los Angeles Times.  
 Circulation at 770 daily newspapers declined 2.8 percent in
the six months ended Sept. 30, the  Newspaper Association of
America  said today in a statement, citing data from the  Audit
Bureau of Circulations . In the year-ago period, circulation fell
by 2.6 percent.  
 The drop in readership adds to concerns about a decline in
advertising sales as readers migrate to the Internet. At Tribune
Co., which is evaluating takeover proposals, average paid
circulation at the Los Angeles Times fell 8 percent in the six-
month period while the Chicago Tribune declined by 1.7 percent.  
 ``The financial performance of newspaper companies will
continue to be pressured by an accelerating shift of advertising
dollars,'' Michael Simonton, an analyst with Fitch Ratings, said
today in a research note.  
 While few big-city newspapers produced gains, New York's
warring tabloids both advanced with the New York Post surpassing
the Daily News. Circulation at the Boston Globe, owned by  New
York Times Co. (NYT) , fell by 6.7 percent.  
 ``The losses were greater at the metropolitan-size
newspapers,'' Newspaper Association Chief Executive Officer John
Sturm said on a conference call.  
 20-Year Slump  
 Newspapers had average daily circulation of 43.7 million in
the six months ended Sept. 30, down from 45 million in the year-
earlier period, when circulation tracked by the Audit Bureau
declined by 2.6 percent.  
 The most recent slide extends a 20-year slump, from an
average of 62.3 million papers sold each weekday in 1985.
Circulation suffered consecutive declines over the last five
years, Sturm said today.  
 Sunday circulation fell 3.4 percent to 47.6 million, the
Vienna, Virginia-based newspaper association said, citing an
analysis of Audit Bureau figures.  
 Shares of Tribune, the second-largest U.S. newspaper
publisher, fell 2 cents to $33.45 at 4:01 p.m. in  New York  Stock
Exchange composite trading. McLean, Virginia-based Gannett Co.,
the largest newspaper chain, dropped 29 cents to $60. New York-
based New York Times declined 4 cents to $24.06.  
 Web Site Growth  
 Newspaper owners have bolstered their Web sites to attract
online readers and advertisers, helping to make up for the loss
of readers, the association said. It said newspaper Web sites
serving the 100 largest markets reported an average 8 percent
growth in their online audiences.  
 Almost 57 million Web users visited a newspaper site in the
third quarter, up 24 percent from the year-ago period, the
association said.  
 Tribune last week received competing initial takeover
proposals from buyout firms Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee
Partners LP, people familiar with the matter have said.  
 Average paid circulation Mondays through Fridays fell to
775,766 at the Los Angeles Times, according to Audit Bureau
data. At the  Chicago Tribune , the average weekday paid
circulation declined to 576,132.  
 Long Island , New York-based Newsday, also owned by based
Tribune, saw circulation drop 5 percent to 410,579.  
 Other Declines  
 At the New York Times, the average weekday circulation
declined 3.5 percent to 1.09 million, while the Boston Globe's
circulation fell to 386,415, the Audit Bureau said. Paid
subscribers fell 3.3 percent to 656,297 at the Washington Post,
owned by  Washington Post Co. (WPO)   
 New York's tabloids both showed gains, with  News Corp. (NWSA) 's
Post rising 5.1 percent to beat rival Daily News, owned by
 Boston Properties Inc. (BXP)  Chairman Mortimer Zuckerman. Daily News
weekday circulation rose 1 percent to 693,382 from 686,274.  
 The Rupert Murdoch-controlled Post, rising to 704,011 from
669,663 in the year-ago period, advanced to the fifth-largest
U.S. daily, based on circulation, after  USA Today , the Wall
Street Journal, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.
