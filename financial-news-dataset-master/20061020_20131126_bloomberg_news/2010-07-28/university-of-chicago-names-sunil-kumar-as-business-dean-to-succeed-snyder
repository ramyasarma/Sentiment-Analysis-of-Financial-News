             The University of Chicago Booth
School of Business chose as its next leader Sunil Kumar, an
associate dean at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.  
 Kumar, 42, succeeds  Edward Snyder , who stepped down in June
and will run the Yale School of Management, in New Haven,
Connecticut, starting next year. Kumar will begin a five-year
term as dean on Jan. 1, the University of Chicago said in a
statement today.  
 Kumar now oversees the master’s of business administration
program at Stanford, near Palo Alto, California, where he is
also a professor of operations, information and technology.
Kumar, who was born in India, received a Ph.D. in electrical
engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
and has taught at Stanford since 1996.  
 Kumar “brings the right blend of vision, entrepreneurial
energy and academic leadership that will build on the
contributions of Chicago Booth at a time of tremendous momentum
and achievement,” University of Chicago President Robert Zimmer
and Provost  Thomas Rosenbaum  said in the statement.  
 Under Snyder, who ran the business school for nine years,
Chicago Booth opened the $125 million Harper Center building and
received a $300 million gift from  David Booth , the chairman and
co-chief executive officer of Austin, Texas-based Dimensional
Fund Advisors Inc. The school, founded in 1898, is ranked No. 1
among U.S. full-time MBA programs by  Bloomberg Businessweek 
magazine.  
 Harry Davis , a professor of management at the University of
Chicago, will serve as interim dean until Kumar begins his term.
