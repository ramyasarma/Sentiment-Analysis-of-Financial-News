             Cotton fell from a four-week high as
rain in the Mississippi River Delta region eased concern that
dry weather will damage crops in the U.S., the world’s largest
exporter. Orange-juice futures also dropped.  
 Rains were heavier-than-expected yesterday in southern and
some central parts of the Delta, the second-biggest U.S. growing
region after Texas, and more is expected through tomorrow, said
World Weather Inc. in Overland Park, Kansas. The moisture will
aid crops hurt by a drier-than-normal weather,  data  from the
Mississippi State University Extension Service show.  
 “It has been too dry in the Delta, so rain this time of
year will be welcome,” said  Sid Love , the president of Joe
Kropf & Sid Love Consulting Services Inc. in Overland Park,
Kansas. Crop conditions indicate “we possibly have a big crop
year, maybe even bigger than what the USDA has been saying.”  
 Cotton futures for December delivery fell 0.39 cents, or
0.5 percent, to close at 76.31 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, after touching 77.29 cents, the
highest price for a most-active contract since June 30. The
decline today was the first in six sessions, halting a 5.1
percent rally.  
 In the Delta region, rainfall today totaled 1.52 inches (39
millimeters) in Natchez, Mississippi, and 2.73 inches in
Vicksburg, World Weather data show. From July 12 to July 19,
Batesville, Mississippi, got 0.88 inches, or 65 percent less
than a year earlier, according to the university extension
service.  
 In another ICE market, orange juice for September delivery
fell 1.2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to close at $1.455 a pound at
2:03 p.m. in New York, the first drop in nine sessions.
