             Husky Energy Inc. , the Canadian oil
company controlled by Hong Kong billionaire  Li Ka-Shing , said it
will decide by the end of the year if it will spin off Asian oil
and gas assets.  
 “We’re evaluating whether a spinoff and a separate listing
of our Asian assets represent the best way to maximize value for
shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer  Asim Ghosh  said on a
conference call today. The company said in February that a
decision on the spinoff would come by the middle of this year.  
 Husky declined C$1.19 to C$25.50 at 1:53 p.m. on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. Husky earlier fell as much as 5.8
percent to C$24.87 in Toronto trading after reporting lower
second-quarter earnings than  analysts  estimated.  
 Net income fell 38 percent to C$266 million ($257 million),
or 31 cents a share, from C$430 million a year earlier, Calgary-
based Husky said today in a statement. Per-share profit was 12
cents below the average of 10 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Husky partners with Cnooc Ltd. to develop gas fields in
South China Sea. One of the fields, Liwan 3-1, is China’s first
deep-water discovery and may be the nation’s largest offshore
deposit with more than 100 billion cubic meters (3.5 trillion
cubic feet) of gas.  
 Husky is also open to buying assets, Ghosh said. The prime
focus of acquisitions at this point will be “currently flowing
barrels,” he said.
