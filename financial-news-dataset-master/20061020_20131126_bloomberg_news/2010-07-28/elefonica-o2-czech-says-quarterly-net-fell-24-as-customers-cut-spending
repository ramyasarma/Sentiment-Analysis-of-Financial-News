             Telefonica O2 Czech Republic AS , the
largest Czech telecommunications company, said second-quarter
profit fell 24 percent as customers cut spending on services and
a one-off item from a year ago wasn’t repeated.  
 Net income for three months ended June 30 was 2.34 billion
koruna compared with 3.08 billion koruna a year earlier, the
Prague-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
Revenue fell 4.1 percent to 14.06 billion koruna.  
 Operating income before depreciation and amortization fell
17.2 percent to 5.86 billion koruna in the period from a year
ago.  
 Operating income fell “largely” due to a revenue decline,
the impact of a settlement agreement with T-Mobile and the
negative effect of restructuring costs taken through the first
half of 2010, the company said.
