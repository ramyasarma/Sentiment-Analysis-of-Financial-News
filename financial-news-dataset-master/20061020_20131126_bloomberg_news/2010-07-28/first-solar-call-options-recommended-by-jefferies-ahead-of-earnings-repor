             Investors should buy bullish First
Solar Inc.  options  because the world’s largest maker of thin-
film solar power modules may beat analysts’ estimates when it
reports earnings tomorrow, Jefferies Group Inc. said.  
 Derivatives strategists at New York-based Jefferies
recommended buying August $140 calls while selling August $160
calls, a strategy known as a spread that cuts the cost of the
trade while capping potential profit. The shares climbed 0.2
percent to $137.04 as of 4 p.m. in New York.  
 Jefferies equity analyst  Jesse Pichel  “suspects Street
expectations are for a second-quarter beat and modest guide up
tomorrow,” the strategists wrote in a note today. Investors
should use the trade “to get some upside exposure in the name
and take advantage of the seemingly underappreciated potential
for a big move on earnings.”  
 First Solar, which will release second-quarter earnings on
July 29 after the close of markets in New York, is rated
“hold” by Pichel. He has a $138 12-month share-price forecast
and expects second-quarter earnings excluding some costs will be
$1.29, below the average estimate of $1.62 according to a
Bloomberg survey of 31 analysts.  
 First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona,  fell  earlier this
month after German lawmakers on July 9 backed reductions in
solar-power subsidies of as much as 16 percent. The shares
rebounded 6.3 percent from July 16 to today.
