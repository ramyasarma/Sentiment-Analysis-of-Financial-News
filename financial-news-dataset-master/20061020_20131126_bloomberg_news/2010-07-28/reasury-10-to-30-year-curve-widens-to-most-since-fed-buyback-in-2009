             The  difference  in yields on 10- and
30-year Treasuries reached the widest level since the Federal
Reserve began buying U.S. government securities in March 2009.  
 The gap increased as much as 3 basis points to 106 basis
points, or 1.06 percentage points. Yields on Treasuries maturing
in seven years or less fell while 30-year yields rose as a
government report showed an unexpected drop last month in
durable-goods orders, increasing speculation the recovery is
slowing. Gross domestic product slowed to 2.5 percent in the
second quarter, government data on July 30 is forecast to show.  
 “People are reluctant to take the view of low growth and
low inflation out beyond the intermediate part of the curve,”
said  James Caron,  head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at Morgan
Stanley in New York, one of 18 primary dealers that trade with
the Fed. “The market’s not buying the deflation story. If it
were, this curve would be a lot flatter.”  
 The  30-year bond  yield rose 3 basis points to 4.11 percent
and the 10-year yield was little changed at 3.05 percent.  
 The Fed announced plans to purchase $300 billion of
Treasuries in March 2009 to keep yields low as part of attempts
by policy makers and government officials to lift the economy
from the worst slowdown since the Great Depression.
