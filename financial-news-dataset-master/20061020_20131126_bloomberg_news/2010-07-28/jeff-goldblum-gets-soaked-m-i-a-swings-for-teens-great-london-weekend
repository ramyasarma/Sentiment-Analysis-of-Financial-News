             A communal campfire tent goes up in
the courtyard of London’s  Victoria & Albert  Museum late today.  
 Guests can enjoy an evening of folk ballads, ghostly tales
and clog dancing free of charge, all part of  V&A Summer Camp  --
the museum’s inaugural two-day celebration of design.  
 Over the weekend, leading world designers will be on hand
in tents of their own to run workshops and offer tips on how to
make furniture and take-away toys.

 Saturday  
 A robed Algerian smokes hashish from a pipe that’s longer
than his arm.  
 He features in an 1857 photograph by Camille Silvy,
currently the toast of the  National Portrait Gallery  (through
Oct. 24). Silvy, a contemporary of Baudelaire and Balzac,
captured ravishing views of rural France and North Africa
before becoming a society photographer in London.  
 Sitters included  Queen Victoria ’s other half Prince
Albert, and lesser blue-bloods who used the photos as calling
cards in a 19th-century lead-up to Facebook. Sadly, manic-
depressive Silvy spent the last three decades of his life in a
psychiatric ward.  
 The National Portrait Gallery also has a photography show
of athletes and personalities involved in the London 2012
Olympics, some in wax-museum-like poses. “Road to 2012:
Setting Out” ends Sept. 26.

 Terroirs  -- tucked away on William IV Street, which cuts
across from the National Portrait Gallery to the Strand -- is a
fine spot for a drink or a meal: It’s inexpensive and the wine
list is among the most adventurous in London. Terroirs is often
packed, so try to book early. Information:

 Saturday Night  
 Jeff Goldblum  is spending the summer in London getting
buckets of cold water poured over his head.  
 Goldblum stars in  Neil Simon ’s “The Prisoner of Second
Avenue” at the Vaudeville Theatre. Though written in 1971, the
play is topical: It’s about the human cost of recession.
Goldblum strikes the right balance between slapstick and
despair. He plays the Manhattan-based company man coming
undone, whose upstairs neighbors counter his complaints with
water buckets.  
 “I don’t need analysts: I need lost and found,” he tells
his wife (the talented Oscar winner  Mercedes Ruehl ), before
burglars take everything including the dental floss.  
 “The Prisoner of Second Avenue” closes Sept. 25, and is
an  Old Vic  production staged in the West End. Information:
 staged in the West End. Information:

 As a dance option, Saturday is the last chance to see the
French phenomenon  Sylvie Guillem  in “Eonnagata” at  Sadler’s
Wells . Information:  http://www.sadlerswells.com  or +44-844-412-
4300.  
 Sunday  
 M.I.A. headlines the festival with the youngest audience
(by far) on Sunday. The singer --  Maya Arulpragasam  to her
friends -- performs tracks from her third album, a mash of pop,
dance and disco. Also in the line-up: chart-topping Tinchy
Stryder, the  Courteeners  and  Lightspeed Champion . And all for
just 26.50 pounds ($41.36) a ticket.  
 There’s one catch: To get into the Underage Festival, you
have to be between 14 and 18. While parents and guardians are
kept out, there’s plenty of catering at the gate and picnic
opportunities in surrounding Victoria Park. Police and
organizers will keep a close watch on those inside.
