             European stocks slid, halting a six-
day rally for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index , as an unexpected
decline in orders for U.S. durable goods overshadowed better-
than-estimated company earnings.  
 Yell Group Plc paced retreating shares, slumping 19 percent
after the publisher posted a drop in profit. Nexans SA lost 8.5
percent after the world’s biggest maker of cables and wires
reported narrowing first-half margins. Invensys Plc led
technology-related shares lower after announcing a charge for
its rail business.  
 The  Stoxx 600  fell 0.4 percent to 257.21 as of the 4:50
p.m. close in London, reversing an earlier rally of as much as
0.6 percent. The gauge has declined 5.5 percent from this year’s
high on April 15 amid concern that austerity measures from
indebted European governments will harm the economic recovery.  
 “There are still a lot of questions on the economy and
whether the economy will continue to grow or not,” said London-
based  Kevin Lilley , who helps oversee about $2 billion at Royal
London Asset Management. “The market is coming off a very weak
couple of months. We are now starting results seasons proper and
the early signs are very encouraging.”  
 National benchmark indexes fell in 13 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100  retreated 0.9 percent and
Germany’s DAX lost 0.5 percent. France’s CAC 40 gained 0.1
percent.  
 Goods Orders Fall  
 European stocks extended losses after a U.S. Commerce
Department report showed  orders for durable goods  in the world’s
largest economy unexpectedly dropped by 1 percent. Economists
forecast orders would climb 1 percent, according to a Bloomberg
News survey.  
 Credit Suisse Group AG cut its forecast for gains in U.S.
stocks by the end of this year while advising clients to stay
“overweight” on equities as economic growth and earnings
support the market.  
 “Even if we assume a slight further weakening of the
economy, equities are looking cheap,”  Andrew Garthwaite , the
head of global equity strategy at Credit Suisse wrote in the
report today. “The preconditions for a double-dip in the U.S.
are not in place. Equities are discounting a scenario somewhere
between a soft landing and a mild hard landing.”  
 Yell Group tumbled 19 percent to 24.5 pence, erasing
yesterday’s 13 percent jump. The publisher of the U.K.’s yellow
pages directories said first-quarter profit fell 26 percent to
11.1 million pounds ($17.3 million) as sales declined.  
 Nexans, Invensys  
 Nexans  sank 8.5 percent to 51.25 euros after the company
said price pressure in some high-voltage cables and the European
building market pushed profitability to 4 percent of revenue,
down from 5.3 percent a year earlier.  
 Invensys dropped 4.7 percent to 279.1 pence, leading
technology-related shares to the biggest decline among 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600, after announcing a 13 million-
pound charge to its rail business.  
 Ericsson AB, the world’s biggest maker of mobile-phone
networks, fell 3.5 percent to 77.7 kronor and Atos Origin SA
sank 4.1 percent to 32.19 euros.  
 CSR Plc plunged 14 percent to 355.5 pence as the maker of
microchips used in Nokia Oyj mobile phones said it sees
“growing caution in the macroeconomic outlook” for the second
half of 2010.  
 Safran SA and  Infineon Technologies AG  climbed more than
2.5 percent after increasing their earnings outlooks.  
 Safran Surges  
 Safran rallied 6.5 percent to 21.51 euros. Europe’s second-
biggest maker of aircraft engines raised its forecast for 2010
and predicted profitability will improve as air traffic and
demand for services rebounds. First-half profit gained 7.7
percent to 223 million euros ($290 million).  
 Infineon  climbed 2.6 percent to 5.18 euros. Europe’s
second-largest chipmaker raised its 2010 outlook for a third
time on semiconductor demand from makers of cars and consumer
electronics.  
 Deutsche Boerse AG  rallied 4 percent to 54.06 euros after
reporting second-quarter profit excluding some items of 1.20
euros a share. That beat the 91-cent average projection of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Europe’s largest exchange
operator by market value also said costs in 2010 will be lower
than it projected.  
 Portugal Telecom SGPS SA gained 2.8 percent to 8.53 euros.
Portugal’s biggest phone company agreed to sell its stake in
Vivo Participacoes SA, Brazil’s largest wireless company, to
Telefonica SA after the Spanish company raised its bid for a
third time to 7.5 billion euros.  
 Separately, Portugal Telecom agreed to pay 8.44 billion
reais ($4.8 billion) for 22.4 percent stake in Brazil’s biggest
phone operator, Telemar Norte Leste, to remain in the Brazilian
telecommunications market.  
 EFG International AG  sank 20 percent to 12.55 Swiss francs,
the biggest retreat since February 2009. The Swiss bank posted a
first-half loss of 809.8 million francs ($764 million) after
writing down goodwill on two hedge fund businesses and a Swedish
asset manager.
