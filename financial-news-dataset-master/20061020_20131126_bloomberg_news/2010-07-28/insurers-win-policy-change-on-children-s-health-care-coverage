             Insurers led by  UnitedHealth Group
Inc.  and WellPoint Inc. can limit when parents buy child-only
policies under an Obama administration ruling that will keep
consumers from buying coverage only after their kids fall ill.  
 The advisory posted yesterday on the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services’  website  allows insurers to implement
“open enrollment” periods, outside of which families wouldn’t
be able to purchase coverage.  
 Under the health law signed in March by President  Barack Obama , insurers may not exclude sick children from coverage
after Sept. 23. Health plans complained that some parents might
take advantage of the policy, potentially driving up premiums
for all consumers. Last week, state insurance officials reported
that some insurers planned to end child-only plans in response.  
 The ruling “will help ensure millions of children have
access to affordable health-care coverage,” said  Karen Ignagni ,
president of Washington-based trade group  America’s Health
Insurance Plans , in a statement today.  
 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, an insurer that had said
it planned to close enrollment in child-only coverage, announced
it would resume sales of the policies in light of the posting.  
 “This policy will ensure that children get the
comprehensive coverage they need while avoiding this unintended
consequence,”  Scott Serota , president of the Blue Cross Blue
Shield Association, an insurance trade group in Washington, said
in a statement.  
 State Requirements  
 The guidance doesn’t specify when insurers must hold open-
enrollment periods, how long they must be or how often they must
be offered. State requirements would apply where they exist,
according to the posting.  
 The policy will be monitored, and HHS said it will “issue
further guidance on open-enrollment periods if it appears that
their use is limiting the access intended under the law.”  
 “Some state insurance commissioners expressed concern
that, without an open enrollment period that was widely
communicated, people might wait until their children got sick
to enroll them in coverage, causing plans’ costs to increase,”
said  Nancy-Ann Min DeParle , director of the White House Office
of Health Reform,  in a blog post . “We were concerned when last
week, some indicated that insurance companies would choose to
stop offering policies for children rather than cover kids with
pre-existing conditions.”  
 UnitedHealth, based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, fell
39 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $30.39 as of 11:50 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are little changed
this year. Indianapolis-based Wellpoint fell $1.75 to $51.05.
