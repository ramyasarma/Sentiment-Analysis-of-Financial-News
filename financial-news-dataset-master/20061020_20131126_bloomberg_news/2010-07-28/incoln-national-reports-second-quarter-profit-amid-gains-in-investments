             Lincoln National Corp. , the life
insurer that paid back a $950 million U.S. rescue last month,
reported a second-quarter profit on improvements in its
investment portfolio and a surge in revenue.  
 Net income  was $255 million, or 33 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $161 million, or 62 cents, in the same period a
year earlier, the Philadelphia-based insurer said today in a
 statement . Revenue jumped 38 percent to $2.6 billion from $1.88
billion. Realized losses on investments narrowed to $37 million
from $236 million.  
 “Strong sales across all segments combined with good
persistency drove growth in net flows,” Chief Executive Officer Dennis R. Glass  said in the statement.  
 Lincoln fell  47 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $24.09 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading before earnings
were released, and has declined 3.2 percent this year. The 24-
company  KBW Insurance Index , which includes Lincoln, has risen
more than 9 percent this year.  
 Lincoln sold stock and bonds during the quarter to
repurchase the preferred shares it had issued to the U.S.
Treasury Department. The move prompted Fitch Ratings to upgrade
Lincoln’s long-term  ratings .  
 Paying back the government “demonstrates an overall
improved financial position and increased access to capital
markets,” Fitch said in a June 30 report.  
 Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose to
$39.89 a share from $38.19 on March 31.  
 Operating income, which excludes some investment results
and discontinued operations, was 86 cents a share, beating the
80-cent  estimate  of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
