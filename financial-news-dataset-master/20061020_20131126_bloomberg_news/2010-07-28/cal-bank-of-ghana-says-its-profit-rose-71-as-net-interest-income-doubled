             CAL Bank Ltd., a Ghanaian lender,
said profit for the first half through June surged 71 percent as
net interest income more than doubled.  
 Net income advanced to 4.8 million cedis from 2.8 million
cedis a year earlier, the Accra-based bank said in a statement
published in the Daily Graphic newspaper today.  
 Net interest income, the difference between money paid out
on deposits and earnings on loans, climbed to 17 million cedis
from 7.7 million cedis, it said.
