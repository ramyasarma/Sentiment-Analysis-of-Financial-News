             Newcastle United signed defender  Sol Campbell  to a one-year contract, the Premier League club said.  
 Campbell, 35, was out of contract after finishing last
season at Arsenal. The former England defender had been linked
with a return to the Gunners, as well as moves to Newcastle’s
northeast rival Sunderland and Celtic.  
 “At this stage of my career, I couldn’t have wished for a
better move,” Campbell said on  Newcastle’s website . “To join a
club such as Newcastle United, with its proud tradition,
heritage and magnificent support, is absolutely tremendous for
me.”  
 Campbell signed with fourth-division Notts County prior to
last season and appeared in just one game before leaving. He
then returned to Arsenal, where he played from 2001-06, in
January for the remainder of the season.
