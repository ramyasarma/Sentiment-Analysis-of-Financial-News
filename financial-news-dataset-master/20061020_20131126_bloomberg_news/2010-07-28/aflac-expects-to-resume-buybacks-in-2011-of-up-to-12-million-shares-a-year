             Aflac Inc.  is “increasingly
likely” to resume its stock buyback program in 2011, and may
repurchase 6 million to 12 million shares a year, Chief
Executive Officer  Daniel Amos  said.  
 The world’s largest seller of supplemental health insurance
will wait “a quarter or two” before making a decision on the
buybacks, Amos said.  
 “Maybe 6 to 12 is kind of a resumption level if things
continue to be stable to improved,” Amos told investors and
analysts on a conference call. “We like the improvement in the
securities values that we’ve seen” and “relative
stabilization” in the fair value of the company’s investment
portfolio.  
 Realized investment losses narrowed to $58 million in the
second quarter from $249 million a year earlier, Aflac said
yesterday as part of its second-quarter earnings report.  
 Amos said Aflac faces a “much more challenging” second
half of the year in terms of sales comparisons. The company is
based in Columbus, Georgia.  
 Aflac shares fell 88 cents, or 1.8 percent, at 10:13 a.m.
in  New York Stock Exchange  composite trading. Aflac is 7.5
percent higher this year.
