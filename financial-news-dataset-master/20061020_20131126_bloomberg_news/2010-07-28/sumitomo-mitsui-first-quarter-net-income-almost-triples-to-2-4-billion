             Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. ,
Japan’s third-largest traded bank by assets, said first-quarter
profit tripled, beating analysts’ estimates as bad-loan charges 
fell and trading income climbed.  
  Net income  climbed to 211.8 billion yen ($2.4 billion) in
the three months ended June 30, from 72.8 billion yen a year
earlier, the company said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today. That beat the 110 billion yen average estimate
of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Eleven months of declining corporate bankruptcies in Japan
helped Chief Executive Officer  Teisuke Kitayama  cut bad-loan
costs by 73 percent during the quarter. The Tokyo-based bank
reiterated its full-year profit  forecast  of 340 billion yen
after corporate sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy
reached a two-year high.  
 “Banks’ non-performing loans are likely to trend down this
year on the improving economic outlook,” said  Ismael Pili , a
Tokyo-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., before today’s
announcement. “It was a strong quarter, driven by lower loan
provisions, and equity and bond related gains.”  
 Sumitomo Mitsui  rose  3.6 percent to 2,679 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange before today’s earnings announcement. The shares
have gained 1.3 percent this year.
