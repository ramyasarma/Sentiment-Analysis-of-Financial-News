             Sanofi-Aventis SA  Chief Executive
Officer  Chris Viehbacher  has support from his board of directors
to offer as much as $70 a share for  Genzyme Corp. , or about
$18.7 billion, said three people with knowledge of the
situation.  
 France’s largest drugmaker is preparing a formal approach,
and plans to send a letter to Genzyme in the coming days that
will detail its interest and give a specific price, said the
people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks
are private. The Paris-based company may offer less than $70 a
share in the letter, two of the people said.  
 Viehbacher is counting on takeovers to help replace revenue
it will lose as its medicines face competition from lower-priced
generic drugs. Sanofi  cut  its 2010 earnings forecast this month
after U.S. regulators approved a generic rival to its Lovenox
blood thinner. Genzyme, the world’s largest maker of medicines
for genetic diseases, last week rebuffed an informal approach by
Sanofi to enter talks, said people familiar with the situation.  
 “Seventy dollars is close, but probably doesn’t get it
done,” said  Phil Nadeau , an analyst with Cowen & Co. in New
York, in a telephone interview. “My guess is that Genzyme would
turn them down, do some negotiations, and the price would go up
a little bit, maybe to $73 or $75.”  
 Genzyme’s Stock  
 Viehbacher declined to comment on Cambridge, Massachusetts-
based Genzyme today in conference calls with reporters and
analysts.  
 Genzyme shares rose $2.03, or 2.9 percent, to $70.02 at
12:25 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The
stock has gained 31 percent since Sanofi’s interest in the
company was first reported on July 23. Sanofi fell 61 cents, or
1.3 percent, to 44.82 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in
Paris.  
 The 50-year-old chief executive, who announced a 7.6
percent increase in second-quarter earnings to 2.48 billion
euros ($3.23 billion) today, said the company remains
“opportunistic” on acquisitions and is looking for takeovers
worth between $5 billion and $20 billion that will bolster
earnings. Sanofi is “disciplined” about takeovers and rejects
“mega-merger-type deals,” he said.  
 A Sanofi acquisition of Genzyme would be the biggest
industry takeover since Merck & Co. bought Schering-Plough Corp.
for about $47 billion in November 2009, according to Bloomberg
data.  
 Struggle for Support  
 Sanofi will struggle to win full support from Genzyme’s
board until an offer price reaches a range of $75 to $85 a
share, said  Geoff Porges , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co. in New York, in a research report. Activist investors
including billionaire  Carl C. Icahn  who controls two board
seats, and  Ralph Whitworth  of Relational Investors, a Genzyme
director, will likely push for a sale, according to Porges.  
 Whitworth deferred a call seeking comment to Genzyme.  Carl Icahn  didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  Bo Piela , a spokesman for Genzyme, declined to comment.  
 Viehbacher likely would need additional board approval to
make an offer for Genzyme higher than $70 a share, according to
the people.  
 Genzyme investors will insist on at least $20 billion, said
 Sven Borho , with OrbiMed Advisors, holder of 2.5 million Genzyme
shares, on July 26.  
 At about $70 a share, Sanofi would be paying 36 times
Genzyme’s 2010 earnings per share as forecast by analysts.
Acquirers of biotechnology companies paid on average 38 times
earnings in transactions announced over the past 12 months,
according to Bloomberg data.  
 Manufacturing Defects  
 Genzyme CEO  Henri Termeer  said in a June 14 interview that
the company wasn’t for sale. It is focused on fixing
manufacturing defects that cut into sales of its biggest
products, Termeer said. He is seeking to revive the drugmaker
after sales slumped 2 percent to $4.5 billion last year,
following a virus contamination at Genzyme’s Allston Landing
factory in Boston.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG are
advising Genzyme on the pending offer, said several people
familiar with the matter. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BNP Paribas
SA are among the banks that have agreed to provide Sanofi with
financing for a possible bid, said these people.

                          July 23 (Bloomberg) -- Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., talks about a potential acquisition of Genzyme Corp. by Sanofi-Aventis SA.
     Sanofi, France’s biggest drugmaker, made a takeover approach to Genzyme, the largest maker of medicines for genetic diseases, about two weeks ago, said two people with knowledge of the matter.
