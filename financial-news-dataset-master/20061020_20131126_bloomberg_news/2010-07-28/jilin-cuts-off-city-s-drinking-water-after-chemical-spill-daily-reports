             The northern Chinese city of Jilin
cut off water yesterday following a chemical dumping accident,
the China Daily reported. Utility officials said the stoppage
was unrelated to the accident, the newspaper said.  
 More than 1,000 barrels containing at least 160,000
kilograms explosive chemical fluid washed into the Songhua
river, the city’s main drinking source, because of flooding at
about 10 a.m., before the water stoppage at about 1 p.m., the
newspaper cited local officials as saying.  
 Jilin Water Group officials said the cutoff was made for
electrical supply maintenance and they have detected no
contamination in the city’s water supply, the report said.
