             Former winners Celtic and Ajax may
miss the Champions League group stage after failing to win their
opening qualifying games.  
 Celtic, the 1967 champion, lost 3-0 at Sporting Braga last
night as goals by Alan, Uwa Echiejile and Matheus sealed a
winning tournamant debut for the Portuguese team. Four-time
winner Ajax drew 1-1 at home in Amsterdam with PAOK Saloniki.  
 The return matches in the third qualifying round are
scheduled Aug. 3 and 4. The 15 winners of the two-game series
advance to playoffs for a place in the group stage of Europe’s
elite club competition.  
 Switzerland’s FC Basel, Rosenborg of Norway and Serbian
champion Partizan Belgrade were among the other winners last
night.
