             India’s government may end controls
on sugar producers after assessing the area planted to cane in
August, Farm Minister Sharad Pawar told reporters in New Delhi.  
 The minister may meet sugar industry bodies tomorrow or on
July 30 to discuss the proposal, he said.  
 The nation’s grain output may exceed last year’s level as
the monsoon has gathered pace across the country, he said.
