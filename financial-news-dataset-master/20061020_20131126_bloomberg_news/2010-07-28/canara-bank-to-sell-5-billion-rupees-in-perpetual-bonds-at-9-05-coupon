             Canara Bank , the second-best
performer on India’s Bankex Index for the last three months,
plans to sell at least 5 billion rupees ($107 million) in
perpetual bonds.  
 The lender, based in Bangalore, has the option of retaining
funds from bidders that exceed the amount sought, according to a
notice on the National Stock Exchange’s website today. The
proceeds will be used to bolster the bank’s tier 1 capital,
according to the statement.  
 The state-run lender will offer a 9.05 percent coupon,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Canara
Bank Managing Director  A. C. Mahajan  wasn’t immediately
available at his office.  
 So-called perpetual notes don’t have maturity dates.
