             India’s National Stock Exchange, the
nation’s largest bourse, and the London Stock Exchange Group Plc
signed an agreement today that may allow access to each other’s
markets.  
 The FTSE Group, in which the London Stock Exchange has a 50
percent stake, may offer the FTSE 100 Index options and futures
on the Indian bourse, while the London-based company may sell
the Nifty options, according to a statement issued by the Indian
company today.  
 “At this stage it’s options, at a later stage it could be
more than that,”  Ibukun Adebayo , the India head of primary
markets at the London Stock Exchange, said at a press briefing
today. “The futures are being traded in the CME. We just need
to make sure there are no issues there.”  
 The National Stock Exchange’s Nifty futures contracts are
traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Singapore
stock exchange.
