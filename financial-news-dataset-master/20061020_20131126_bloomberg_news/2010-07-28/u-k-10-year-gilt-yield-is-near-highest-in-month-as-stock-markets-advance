             U.K. 10-year government bond yields
stayed near the highest in more than a month as higher earnings
at companies from Canon Inc. to PSA Peugeot Citroen boosted
stocks, reducing demand for the safety of fixed income.  
 The two-year note yield was within six basis points of
touching 1 percent for the first time since May. The FTSE 100
Index advanced for a third day. An industry report yesterday
showed retail sales rose at the fastest pace in more than three
years in July.  
 “Stocks will provide the direction,”  Eric Wand , a fixed-
income strategist in London at 4Cast Ltd., a research company
that counts central banks among its subscribers. “We’ll be
stock-watching for a while.”  
 The yield on the 10-year gilt was at 3.51 percent as of
8:45 a.m. in London. The yield was as high as 3.53 percent
yesterday, the most since June 21. The 4.75 percent security
maturing March 2020 gained 0.04, or 40 pence per 1,000-pound
($1,559) face amount, to 110. The two-year yield was at 0.94
percent. It has increased from its 2010 low of 0.72 percent on
July 1.  
 The pound slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5564 and to 83.53 pence
per euro.  
 Gilts returned 4.5 percent this year, compared with a gain
of 5.8 for German bonds, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Treasuries also handed investors 5.8 percent.
