             North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il 
attended a concert yesterday celebrating the 57th anniversary of
the Korean War as the two main adversaries from that conflict
conducted war drills off his country’s eastern coast.  
 The State Merited Chorus performed numbers such as “Our
General is the Best” and “My Song in the Trench,” state-run
Korean Central News Agency reported today. The audience gave
“enthusiastic cheers” to Kim, the Supreme Commander of the
Korean People’s Army, who “heartily congratulated them on the
victory” in the Fatherland Liberation War.  
 As Kim took part in celebrations to mark the cease-fire
that ended open hostility on the Korean peninsula, U.S. and
South Korean forces were putting on a display of military might
that included anti-submarine maneuvers intended as a deterrent
to the North.  
 The four-day drills, which end today, are being held after
a South Korean-led investigation team in May blamed North Korea
for torpedoing the South’s warship Cheonan, killing 46 sailors.  
 The three-year Korean War ended in a cease-fire after
China’s entry pushed back the U.S. and United Nations forces.
South Korea remains technically at war with the North, with 
the two sides separated by one of the world’s most-fortified
borders.

                          July 26 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg's Zeb Eckert reports on joint naval exercises by the U.S. and South Korea that began yesterday off the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, maneuvers North Korea threatened to "counter."
     The drills involve 20 vessels and 200 aircraft, including the USS George Washington, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and will be held until July 28. (Source: Bloomberg)
