             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 4 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade as drought shrinks grain
crops in Russia, Ukraine and other parts of Europe, increasing
demand for U.S. supplies, said  Roy Huckabay , the executive vice
president for the Linn Group in Chicago.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
on speculation that global demand for U.S. supplies will
increase after drought reduced competing oilseed crops, Huckabay
said. Soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $3 higher per 2,000
pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open 0.15 cent to 0.25
cent a pound higher.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 12 cents to 14 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange after drought slashed output in Russia and
Ukraine, Huckabay said.
