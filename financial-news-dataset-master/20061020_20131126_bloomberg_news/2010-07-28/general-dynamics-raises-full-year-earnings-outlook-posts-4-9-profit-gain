             General Dynamics Corp. , the maker of
Abrams tanks and Gulfstream business jets, posted second-quarter
profit that rose 4.9 percent and raised its full-year earnings
forecast as operating margins widened.  
 Net income increased to $648 million, or $1.67 a share,
from $618 million, or $1.60, a year earlier, the Falls Church,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. Profit
excluding some items was $1.68 a share, beating the $1.61
average  estimate  of 17 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Jay Johnson  has projected growth to
resume this year in the Gulfstream business-jet unit after the
company cut production and costs last year. Second-quarter sales
were little changed at $8.1 billion.  
 Earnings from continuing operations in 2010 will be as much
as $6.65 a share. The company had previously forecast profit of
as much as $6.50. Analysts had projected $6.58, the average of
20 estimates.  
 General Dynamics  fell  72 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.77
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares had declined 9 percent this year before today.
