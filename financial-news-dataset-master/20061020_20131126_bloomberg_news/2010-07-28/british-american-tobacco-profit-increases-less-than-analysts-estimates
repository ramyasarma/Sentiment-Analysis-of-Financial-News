             British American Tobacco Plc, the
world’s second-largest traded cigarette maker, said first-half
net income rose to 1.53 billion pounds from 1.45 billion pounds
a year earlier. That missed the 1.7 billion-pound average
estimate of six analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue
increased 8 percent to 7.3 billion pounds.
