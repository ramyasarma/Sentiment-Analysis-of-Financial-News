 Cotton rose to the highest price in
a month on concern that the U.S. won’t be able to ship enough to
China, the world’s largest textile producer, before import
quotas expire at year-end. Orange-juice futures fell.  
 Cotton inventories monitored by ICE Futures U.S. have
plummeted 95 percent since June 2 to 53,315 million bales on
July 26, the lowest level since December 2004.  
 “The rules are that cotton must reach China before the end
of December,” said Ron Lawson, a managing director at Logic
Advisors, a commodities consultancy in Sonoma, California.
“Demand is keen, but no one can sell as yet, because they can’t
get their hands on it. The whole logistics layer is equally as
troublesome as the supply and demand situation.  
 Cotton for December delivery rose 0.23 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 76.93 cents a pound at 11:54 a.m. on ICE in New
York. Earlier, the price touched 77.29 cents, the highest level
for the most-active contract since June 30.  
 Chinese spot-market cotton prices have soared 41 percent to
$1.226 a pound in Beijing in the past year. Global demand is
forecast to grow 6 percent to 116.55 million bales for the
marketing year that ends July 31, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said on July 9. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218
kilograms.  
 The cotton harvest in Texas, the top producing state, is
running one to two weeks later than usual this year, according
to Lawson. “It’s touch and go whether this cotton will be ready
for December delivery,” he said.  
 China will raise its import quota for the fiber by almost 1
million tons, to 3.6 million, and will sell 600,000 tons from
its stockpiles to relieve a domestic shortfall, the China Cotton
Association said June 25.  
 Cotton futures for March delivery were 1.83 cents a pound
less than the December contract at 11:54 a.m. in New York.  
 “The real story is in the December to March spread,”
Lawson said. “It is so fantastical that it’s beyond the pale.
The spread shows people believe we will eventually have enough
cotton. They just don’t have the confidence it will be ready for
December delivery.”  
 In another ICE market, orange juice for September delivery
fell 1.8 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $1.449 a pound, heading for
the first drop in nine sessions.
