             Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  expects further credit-rating downgrades after the
government’s talks with the International Monetary Fund and the
European Union broke down.  
 Any downgrades would cause “temporary turbulence” followed
by the stabilization of the forint and market financing, Orban
told reporters in Budapest today. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s
Investors Service last week said they may lower their ratings
for the country’s debt.  
 “The suspension of talks with the IMF and the ensuing
downgrades, and there will be other downgrades, cause temporary
turbulence and then the forint’s exchange rate and the country’s
capacity to sell bonds returns to the level in which the country
can be said to function in a stable way,” Orban said.  
 The International Monetary Fund and the European Union on
July 17 ended talks with the government without endorsing the
country’s plans for controlling its budget deficit. Hungary has
been relying on an emergency loan since 2008 and the rescue
package has served as a backstop to reassure investors.  
 “The country’s financial situation is never definitively
stable, you always have to tend to it, but it’s true that the
country’s financial situation is now stable and predictable.”
Orban said.  
 The forint has lost 4.7 percent to the euro in the past
three months. It traded at 282.99 as of 4 p.m. in Budapest from
282.37 late yesterday.
