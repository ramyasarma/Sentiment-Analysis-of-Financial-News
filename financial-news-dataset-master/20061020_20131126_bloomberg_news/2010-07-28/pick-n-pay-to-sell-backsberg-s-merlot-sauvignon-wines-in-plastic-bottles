             Plastic wine bottles of Backsberg-
branded merlot and sauvignon blanc will go on sale in South
Africa this month, according to  Pick n Pay Stores Ltd .  
 The wine will be bottled in polyethylene terephthalate, a
light-weight, “eco-friendly” product that takes little energy
to produce, South Africa’s second-largest retailer said in an e-
mailed statement today. The plastic bottling will be exclusively
available at Pick n Pay and won’t compromise the quality of the
wine, according to the Cape Town-based owner of the  Backsberg 
winery, Michael Back.  
 On July 14 South Africa’s Wine and Spirit Board approved
the use of PET, as the plastic is known, for bottling wine,
Business Day said, citing Guillaume Nel, Backsberg’s winemaker.
While wine has traditionally been bottled in glass and sealed
with specially selected cork, screw caps have become more
acceptable in the past decade. Backsberg’s new “Tread Lightly”
range will use both plastic and screw tops.  
 Backsberg is the first South African winery to achieve
 carbon  neutral status, according to its website.
