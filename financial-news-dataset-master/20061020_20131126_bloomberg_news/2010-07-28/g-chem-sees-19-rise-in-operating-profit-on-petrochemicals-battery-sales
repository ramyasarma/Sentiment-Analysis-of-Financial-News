             LG Chem Ltd. , South Korea’s biggest
chemicals maker, may increase operating profit by about 19
percent this year, helped by strong demand for petrochemical
products and batteries for mobile phones.  
 Operating profit may be about 2.5 trillion won ($2.1
billion) in 2010, Chief Executive Officer  Kim Bahn Suk  told
reporters yesterday in Seoul. That compares with 2.1 trillion
won last year.  
 Net income  jumped 36 percent from a year earlier to a
record 645.7 billion won in the three months ended June 30,
driven by Chinese consumption of materials used to make plastics.
Sales of smart phones will boost demand for LG Chem’s batteries
in the second half of this year, the company said on July 20.  
 “New growth engines including car batteries will
contribute to LG Chem’s performance in the future, while
earnings from our current business will continue to grow,” Kim
said.  
 LG Chem is supplying batteries for hybrid cars to Hyundai
Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. and also signed electric car
battery contracts with  General Motors Co. , Ford Motor Co., Volvo
Car Corp.,  Chongqing Changan Automobile Co.  and Eaton Corp.  
 Shares  of LG Chem have advanced 40 percent this year,
making the company the seventh-largest by market capitalization
on the benchmark Kospi index.
