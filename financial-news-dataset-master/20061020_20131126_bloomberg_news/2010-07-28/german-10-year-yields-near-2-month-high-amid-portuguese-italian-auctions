             German two-year government notes
rose for the first time in four days as a report showed euro-
region banks tightened lending in the last quarter and stocks
declined, stoking demand for the safety of fixed income.  
 The advance pushed two-year yields down from near the
highest in three months after they climbed 17 basis points in
the previous three trading days. Portuguese bonds surged after
it sold 1.3 billion euros ($1.63 billion) of 2014 and 2023
securities today, more than the amount it indicated before the
auction. Italy issued 1.5 billion euros of 2021 and 2041
inflation-linked debt.  
 “We’ve had a pretty dynamic sell-off in the last week,
while 10-year yields below 3 percent says there is still a
significant amount of risk aversion in the market,” said  Marius Daheim , a senior fixed-income strategist at Bayerische
Landesbank in Munich.  
 German two-year yields fell four basis points to 0.85
percent as of 1:05 p.m. in London. The 0.5 percent security due
June 2012 rose 0.07, or 70 euro cents per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 99.36. Ten-year bond yields fell two basis points to
2.75 percent.  
 Two-year yields are 25 basis points higher this month, the
biggest gain since June 2008. Ten-year yields climbed 17 basis
points, the first monthly increase since December 2009.  
 Spanish Outperformance  
 Spanish bonds returned 3.8 percent this month, the biggest
gain since November 2008, making them the world’s best
performers, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation Financial Analysts Societies. U.K. gilts
handed investors a loss of 1.5 percent and German debt 1.1
percent, the worst returns among the 26 countries tracked in the
indexes.  
 German government bonds and U.S. Treasuries returned 5.8
percent this year, compared with 4.5 percent for U.K. gilts, the
indexes show.  
 “The downward trend in the net tightening of credit
standards on loans to enterprises, which came to a halt in the
first quarter of 2010, was reversed in the second quarter,
increasing from 3 percent to 11 percent,” the European Central
Bank said in its quarterly Bank Lending Survey today. “Looking
forward, euro-area banks anticipate credit standards on loans to
enterprises to tighten somewhat in the third quarter.”  
 Portuguese 10-year yields fell 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, to 5.09 percent, narrowing the difference with
German bunds by 15 basis points to 228 basis points. The
Italian-German 10-year yield spread widened one basis point to
122 basis points, while the  Spanish-German spread  narrowed two
basis points, to 136 basis points, and the Irish-German spread
fell 13 basis points to 226 basis points.  
 ‘Positive Momentum’  
 “A euro-region issuer has once again managed to sell more
than they indicated,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income
strategist at WestLB AG in London. “The ongoing smooth
digestion of this peripheral issuance is helping the positive
momentum in spreads.”  
 The Portuguese government debt agency, IGCP, said it sold
600 million euros of bonds due in 2014 and 681 million euros of
bonds due in 2023.  The 2014 securities were issued at an
average yield of 3.621 percent, compared with 2.759 percent at a
previous auction of the same-maturity debt on Nov. 11, before
the European sovereign crisis took hold. The auction attracted
bids for 3.1 times the amount offered, versus a bid-to-cover
ratio of 3.4 in November.  
 Italian Sale  
 The 2023 bonds were issued at an average yield of 5.377
percent compared with 4.416 percent at a previous auction of the
same-maturity debt on Jan. 13. Today’s auction had a bid-to-
cover ratio of 1.6 versus 2 in the January sale.  
 Italy auctioned 1.01 billion euros of 2.1 percent
inflation-linked 2021 bonds at an average yield of 2.55 percent
today, attracting bids worth 1.6 times the securities offered.
It also sold 490 million euros of 2.55 percent 2041 inflation-
linked bonds at a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.6.  
 Inflation in six German states accelerated in July after
energy prices rose. The inflation rates in Bavaria, Brandenburg,
Hesse, Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Wuerttemberg all
increased, the states’ statistics offices said today. Economists
predict German inflation, calculated using a harmonized European
method, will  quicken  to 1.1 percent from 0.8 percent, according
to a median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. That
report is due later today.  
 London & Capital Group Holdings Plc, a U.K. fund manager,
bought more U.S., German and British debt in the past six weeks,
betting the nations’ efforts to control deficits will hamper
growth and keep interest rates low.  
 “Countries are grappling with the difficulties of
containing debt so there’s little scope for interest rates to go
higher,”  Sanjay Joshi , who oversees about $500 million as a
portfolio manager at the London-based company, said in an
interview. “We increased our allocation of government bonds
including five-year Treasuries, bunds and gilts.”
