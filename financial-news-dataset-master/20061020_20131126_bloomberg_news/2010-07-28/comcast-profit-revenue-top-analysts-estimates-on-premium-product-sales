             Comcast Corp. , the largest U.S.
cable company, posted second-quarter profit and sales that beat
analysts’ estimates as more customers elected premium services
such as digital video recorders and high-speed Internet.  
 Profit, excluding costs related to the company’s pending
takeover of NBC Universal Inc., was 33 cents a share, on sales
of $9.53 billion, Comcast said today in a statement. That topped
the 32-cent average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts
predicted the cable operator’s sales would be $9.28 billion.  
 Through promotions and system upgrades, Chief Executive
Officer  Brian Roberts  has signed up bandwidth-hungry customers
willing to pay more for the most advanced products available,
such as high-speed Internet and digital video recorders. The
company added 118,000 new broadband subscribers in the quarter
and boosted its average monthly revenue per customer by 8
percent to $127.78.  
 “The share shift from DSL to cable is accelerating as
people need and want more bandwidth,” said  Todd Mitchell , an
analyst at Kaufman Bros. LP in New York, who advises clients to
hold the stock. “Cable just offers a superior product.”  
 Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. reported declines
in DSL, or digital subscriber line, customers in the second
quarter, which bodes well for cable’s competitive edge and
growth prospects, Mitchell said. AT&T lost 348,000 DSL
subscribers in the second quarter, while Verizon shed 168,000.  
 Consumer Confidence  
 Confidence among U.S. consumers declined in July to a five-
month low, according to a report from the New York-based
Conference Board, raising concerns about customers’ ability and
willingness to spend. Comcast’s results showed more of its
customers are willing to spend extra on home entertainment and
offerings like pay-per-view.  
 In the second quarter, 31 percent of Comcast’s 23 million
video customers selected to purchase all three of the company’s
offerings in a bundle: TV, Internet and phone. That’s up from 26
percent in the year prior. The company added 394,000 digital
video customers as they continue to promote their all-digital
rollout.  
 “They’re monetizing their subscriber base better than
expected, aiming for profitable growth,” said  David Joyce , an
analyst at Miller Tabak & Co. LLC in New York. “They converted
a lot more of their subscribers than we expected to digital
video, so that’s good to create long-term growth and incremental
revenue streams.”  
 Net Income  
 Comcast’s net income fell 8.6 percent to $884 million, or
31 cents a share, from $967 million, or 33 cents, a year
earlier. The cable operator’s results were bolstered by a $137
million tax benefit in the year-earlier period.  
 Comcast  slipped 14 cents to $19.33 yesterday on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The stock had gained 15 percent this year before
today.  
 The company added a net 477,000 customers for Internet,
phone and digital TV last quarter, compared with 1.02 million in
the first quarter. The second quarter is typically light on
subscriber additions as college students disconnect their
service while on summer vacation.  
 By paring capital spending as a percentage of sales and
making the most of limited subscriber gains, Comcast boosted its
operating cash flow by 5.7 percent to $3.74 billion. The company
used some of its cash to repurchase 17.3 million shares in the
quarter at a cost of $300 million.
