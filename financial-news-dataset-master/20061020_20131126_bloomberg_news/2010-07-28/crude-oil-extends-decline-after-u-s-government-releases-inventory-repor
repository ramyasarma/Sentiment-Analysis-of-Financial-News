             Oil tumbled to a one-week low after
the government reported an unexpected increase in supplies as
imports jumped to the highest level in almost four years.  
 Crude inventories climbed 7.31 million barrels, or 2.1
percent, to 360.8 million in the week ended July 23, the biggest
increase since March 19, according to the Energy Department.
Analysts forecast a drop to a four-month low in a Bloomberg News
survey. Imports climbed to the highest level since August 2006.  
 “This is huge, and it’s knocking prices down,” said  Sean Brodrick , a natural resource analyst with Weiss Research in
Jupiter, Florida. “It’s only adding to an environment in which
we saw a drop in consumer confidence yesterday. We also recently
saw oil reach the top of its range. You put all these things
together, and it looks like oil will be going to the low $70s.”  
 Oil for September delivery fell 51 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $76.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Futures touched $75.90, the lowest level since July
20, after the report was released at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.  
 Prices have dropped 2.9 percent since settling at an 11-
week high of $79.30 a barrel on July 22. Futures have risen 15
percent in the past year.  
 Oil supplies were forecast to drop 1.73 million barrels,
according to the median estimate of 16 analysts in the Bloomberg
News survey.  
 Imports Gain  
 “Most of the build is related to the big jump in
imports,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker at BNP Paribas Commodity
Futures Inc. in New York. “The market got a little oversold and
started to recover. I still think the market will probably
struggle between $77 and $77.50 levels on the upside.”  
 Imports  rose 1.18 million barrels, or 12 percent, to 11.2
million, the highest level since the week ended Aug. 25, 2006.
The bulk of that oil, 65 percent, went into states along the
Gulf of Mexico, compared with 55 percent the week before.  
 Supplies in Gulf states jumped 8.18 million barrels, or 4.6
percent, to 184.6 million. Regional imports gained 1.73 million
barrels a day, or 32 percent, to a record 7.21 million. The gain
was the largest since Gulf traffic resumed after being slowed by
hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008.  
 U.S. refineries  operated  at 90.6 percent of capacity last
week, a decline from 91.5 percent, the highest level since
August 2007.  
 Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange lost 7 cents to $76.06 a barrel.  
 Durable Goods  
 Oil fell earlier in the day after total orders for durable
goods, those meant to last at least three years, unexpectedly
dropped 1 percent amid a decrease in demand for aircraft. The
Commerce Department report deepened concern that the economic
recovery may be flagging and limiting fuel demand.  
 Economists forecast total durable goods orders would climb
1 percent, according to the median of 76 projections in a
Bloomberg News survey. The Commerce Department revised May’s
decline to 0.8 percent from the previously reported 0.6 percent.  
 The Federal Reserve said today that growth slowed in some
areas over the past two months, dragged down by commercial real
estate and the expiration of a tax credit for homebuyers. In its
Beige Book, the Fed said “activity has continued to increase,
on balance.” Two of the 12 districts reported slower growth and
two said the economy “held steady.”  
 Inventory Concern  
 “People are nervous that the economy is going to mean
weaker demand and that is going to see us later this year with
excessive inventories,” said  Michael Lynch , president of
Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
Massachusetts. “There has long been hope that recovering demand
would reduce the inventories we have now, and that hope is
slowly fading.”  
 U.S. consumer confidence fell to the lowest level in five
months in July, shaken by mounting concern over jobs and wages,
the Conference Board reported yesterday. The U.S. is the world’s
second-largest energy consumer, after China.  
 Most U.S. equities fell for a second day, with the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  declining 0.9 percent to 1,103.59 as of 3:12
p.m. in New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 68.79
points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,468.90.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 527,753
contracts as of 3:13 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 550,774
contracts yesterday, 22 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.24 million contracts.
