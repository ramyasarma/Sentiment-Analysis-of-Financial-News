             KenolKobil Ltd. , a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in seven African countries, returned to
profit in the first half as sales surged amid more stable global
oil prices.  
 Net income was 1.18 billion shillings ($14.6 million) in
the six months through June, compared with a loss of 431.2
million shillings a year earlier, the company said in an e-
mailed statement from the capital, Nairobi, today. Revenue
jumped 40 percent to 60.4 billion shillings, it said.  
 The increase in sales was “a reflection of a more stable
pricing environment internationally and in the local markets,
especially in subsidiaries outside Kenya,” Managing Director
 Jacob Segman  said in the statement.  
 Outside of Kenya, KenolKobil’s Zambian and  Rwandan  units
registered the most growth, he said.  
 Exports and aviation fuel sales, which declined in the
first half of 2009, registered “good profits” in 2010 as the
company focused on its high-margin business segments and reduced
costs, he said.  
 Results in the second half are expected to improve further,
Segman said.  
 “Management is firmly bullish and projects strong end-year
results, expected to come mainly from operations outside Kenya,”
he said.  
 KenolKobil also has operations in Burundi, Uganda,
Tanzania, Ethiopia and Kenya. In addition, the company plans to
begin operations in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, it said on June 26.
