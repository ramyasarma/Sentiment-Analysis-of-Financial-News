             Southern Copper Corp. , the largest
producer of the metal in Peru, said profit from its operations
in the South American country rose 93 percent in the second
quarter after copper prices surged.  
 Profit excluding the company’s Mexican mines rose to $271.6
million from $140.6 million in the year-earlier period, the
Phoenix-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  
 Sales increased to $738.2 million from $475.2 million as
New York-traded copper futures averaged $3.19 per pound, 51
percent higher in the quarter than a year earlier, the company
said. Average silver prices rose 33 percent to $18.35 per ounce,
it said.  
 “It was a solid quarter for Southern Copper thanks to
prices,”  Daniel Mori , a mining analyst at Lima-based brokerage
SAB Centura, said in a telephone interview before the results
were released. “The company got the full benefit of prices as
it doesn’t have any significant hedging.”  
 Copper futures for September delivery fell 1.65 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $3.2065 a pound today on the Comex division of
the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 Southern Copper declined 92 cents, or 2.9 percent, to
$31.22 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock
has gained 22 percent in the past year. The earnings report was
released after the close of regular trading.  
 Copper output fell 3 percent to 184.4 million pounds in the
quarter as ore grades declined at the Cuajone and Toquepala
mines in Peru, the company said.  
 Southern said it invested $134.5 million in the quarter in
expansion plans that aim to add 60,000 metric tons to annual
copper production.
