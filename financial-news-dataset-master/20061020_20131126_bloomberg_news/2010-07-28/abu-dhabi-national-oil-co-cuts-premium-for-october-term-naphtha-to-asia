             Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. made what
may be its final offer to Asian buyers to supply naphtha for a
year from October, said two traders with knowledge of the talks.  
 The company reduced its offer for splitter-grade naphtha to
a premium of $11.50 a metric ton to its benchmark Middle East
prices from $13 a ton, said the two traders, who declined to be
identified because the discussions are confidential. Pentane-
plus naphtha was offered at $12.50 a ton above the formula, down
from $14 a ton, they said.  
 Abu Dhabi National, also known as Adnoc, indicated to
buyers that the prices are final, the traders said. Company
officials weren’t immediately available for comment when
contacted by telephone.  
 This is the first time that the company, which usually
offers term supplies starting January, April and July, is
selling an October contract.
