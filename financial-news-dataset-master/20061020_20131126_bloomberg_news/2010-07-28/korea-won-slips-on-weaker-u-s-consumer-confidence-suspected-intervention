             South Korea’s won fell for the first
time in seven days after U.S. consumer confidence slipped to a
five-month low and traders said the central bank intervened to
support exports.  
 The Bank of Korea bought about $150 million in the first
hour of local trading today after reporting the biggest current-
account  surplus  in a year, according to two traders who asked
not to be identified. The government last month announced a
tightening of limits on currency derivatives to curb capital
flows and Vice Finance Minister  Yim Jong Yong  said policy makers
would use “smoothing-operation” measures to stabilize the won.  
 “The pace of the won’s movement will be controlled,” said
 Sung Jae Man , a currency dealer at Tong Yang Securities Co Ltd.
in Seoul. “Disappointing U.S. consumer data and the possibility
of intervention will keep the won in the 1,180s against the
dollar today.”  
 The won fell 0.2 percent to close at 1,184.20 per dollar in
Seoul, after strengthening 2.9 percent in the last six days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency, which has
weakened 5.3 percent in the past three months, yesterday reached
a five-week high of 1,181.33. Sung said intervention will make
it difficult to break 1,180 this week.  
 The current-account surplus widened to $5.04 billion in
June, from a revised $3.82 billion the previous month, the Bank
of Korea reported today. July’s surplus will be similar to
June’s on robust exports, Lee Young Bog, a central bank official,
told reporters today.  
 The central bank this month forecast a surplus of $21
billion for 2010, compared with an April estimate of $10.5
billion and a record surplus of $42.7 billion last year.  
 Growth, Inflation  
 South Korea’s gross domestic product  rose  1.5 percent in
the second quarter from the previous three months, faster than
the 1.3 percent growth forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Strengthening demand prompted the central bank to
lift its  benchmark interest rate  this month to 2.25 percent,
from a record-low 2 percent, to keep inflation in check.  
 Companies including Samsung Electronics Co. and Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. this month reported record second-quarter
earnings as a weaker won boosted the local-currency value of
their overseas sales.  
 Asia’s fourth-largest economy will expand 5.9 percent this
year after having grown 0.2 percent in 2009, the Bank of Korea
said on July 12. The central bank forecast this month that
consumer prices will rise by 2.8 percent this year, revising a
previous estimate of 2.6 percent.  
 South Korean bonds rose for a second day, with the yield on
the 3.75 percent note due June 2013 holding falling one basis
point to 3.86 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
