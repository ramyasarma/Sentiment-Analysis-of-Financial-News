             India’s benchmark stock index fell
the most in three weeks. Reliance Industries Ltd., the nation’s
most valuable company, led the decline as investors speculated
its quarterly profit growth will slow amid delays in increasing
natural gas output.  
 Reliance Industries  lost 3.1 percent, the most in almost
two months. Higher gas output from the largest Indian field may
be behind schedule, two people with knowledge of the plan said
yesterday, when the company posted growth in its first-quarter
net income of 32 percent from a year earlier.  
 “The year-on-year result of Reliance has met expectations,
but for quarter-on-quarter it has slightly disappointed,” said
 Alex Mathews , head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial
Services Ltd. in Kochi.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 120.24, or 0.7 percent, to 17,957.37, its steepest decline
since July 7. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock
Exchange lost 0.6 percent to 5,397.55. The  BSE 200 Index  dropped
0.4 percent to 2,287.41.  
 Reliance Industries dropped 3.1 percent to 1,021.25 rupees,
its biggest drop since June 1. The company expects to increase
output by 33 percent to 80 million cubic meters a day at India’s
largest gas field as late as 2012, the people said, at least two
years behind schedule.  
 Mahindra  
 Quarterly profit through June expanded 3 percent from the
previous three months as Reliance failed to increase gas
production, said  Deven Choksey , chief executive officer at K.R.
Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. in Mumbai.  
 Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., India’s biggest tractor maker,
climbed 1.3 percent to 648.05 rupees, its highest close since at
least 1991. Quarterly profit rose 40 percent to 5.62 million
rupees, it said in a filing to the stock exchange. Separately,
Mahindra will roll out its cheapest model in more parts of the
country as farmers switch to machines from oxen, Bishwambhar
Mishra head of the company’s Swaraj tractor unit, said in a
phone interview yesterday from Chandigarh, India.  
 The Sensex may rise 16 percent by March 30 as the nation’s
economy expands, according to Veda Investments LLC. The gauge is
likely to reach 21,000 by the end of the financial year as the
economy may expand by more than 9 percent, more than the central
bank’s forecast 8.5 percent pace,  Vikas Pershad , chief executive
officer of Veda Investments , said today in a Bloomberg
Television interview.  
 Demand  
 The central bank yesterday raised its forecast for economic
growth as a strengthening domestic demand trumps concern that
the global economy will slow amid Europe’s debt crisis and
elevated U.S. unemployment.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  4.73 billion rupees  ($100.8
million) of Indian equities on July 26, raising total
investments in the stocks this year to 425.2 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Aban Offshore Ltd.  (ABAN IN) soared 8.8 percent to 897.95
rupees. India’s largest oil rig company received 97 percent of
an insurance claim on the sinking of its semi-submersible rig
‘Aban Pearl,’ which had an assessed insurance value of $235
million, according to a statement on the Bombay Stock Exchange
today.  
 GMM Pfaudler Ltd.  (GMM IN) sank 7.1 percent to 114.45
rupees. The maker of glass-lined reactors for the pharmaceutical
industry reported net income declined 26 percent to 19.1 million

rupees from 785 million rupees a year earlier.  
 Kingfisher Airlines Ltd.  (KAIR IN) gained 3.9 percent to

airline has also appointed Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley, CLSA
and UBS AG to manage a plan to sell global depositary receipts
this year, according to the presentation.
