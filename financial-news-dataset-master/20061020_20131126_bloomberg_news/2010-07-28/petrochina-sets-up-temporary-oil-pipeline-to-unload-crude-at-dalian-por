             PetroChina Co. has set up a
temporary oil pipeline at its 300,000 ton oil terminal at
Dalian’s Xingang port to unload crude cargoes, parent China
National Petroleum Corp. said.  
 PetroChina’s Dalian and Wepec oil refineries are both
operating normally after a July 16 explosion damaged oil
pipelines and caused an oil spill. PetroChina targets processing
1.42 million metric tons of oil at the Dalian plant this month,
CNPC said on its website today.
