             Investors should sell Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  options  to profit from a “range-bound” equity
market that’s likely to fluctuate less this year, UBS AG said.  
 Investors should sell December 1,200 calls and December
1,000 puts, a strategy known as a “strangle” that profits from
decreasing volatility, UBS options strategist  Mitchell Revsine 
wrote in a note. Options prices indicate that the S&P 500, which
fell 0.7 percent to 1,106.13 at 4 p.m. New York time today,
won’t exceed 1,250 -- a level near its high since Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 bankruptcy of 1,255.08 -- or
decline to a one-year low of 950, he wrote.  
 The S&P 500 has rallied 7.3 percent this month, erasing a
2010 loss of as much as 8.3 percent as economic reports signal
that the recovery may continue. Since July 12, 81 percent of S&P
500 companies reporting quarterly results have  topped estimates .
The index is still down 9.1 percent from the 19-month high of
1,217.28 it reached on April 23.  
 “The optimal outcome at expiration would be for the index
to be above the put strike and below the call strike, in which
case the entire premium would be retained,” the New York-based
strategist wrote. “The option market is currently implying a 66
percent probability that the trade will be profitable, to some
degree.”  
 Selling a strangle is a bet that the shares won’t move
beyond either strike price before expiration, allowing the
seller to keep what the buyer paid. Options are derivatives that
give the right to buy or sell assets at a set price by a
specific date. Investors use the contracts to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate or
bet that  volatility , or price swings, will increase or decrease.
