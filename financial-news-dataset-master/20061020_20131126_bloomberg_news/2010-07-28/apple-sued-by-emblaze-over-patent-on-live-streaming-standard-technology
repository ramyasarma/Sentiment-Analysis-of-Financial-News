             Apple Inc.  was sued by  Emblaze Ltd. 
over allegations Apple’s HTTP live-streaming application
infringes the Israeli company’s U.S. patent.  
 Emblaze, a designer of mobile phones, says it developed
technology for “real-time broadcasting” over a network such as
the Internet and has held the patent since 2002. Emblaze said
has used the technology in its products to save data traffic
because it doesn’t require devoted streaming servers and allows
reliable streaming even through firewalls.  
 Apple announced the introduction of its “HTTP Live
Streaming Standard” technology in mid-2009, according to the
complaint filed today in federal court in New York. It is
embedded in such products as the iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and
installed in Mac notebooks and desktop computers, the lawsuit
claims.  
 Emblaze says the patent infringement is causing
“irreparable harm” to the company. Apple has used and
continues to use the technology and “has made and will continue
to make unlawful gains and profits” at its expense, according
to the complaint.  
 The lawsuit seeks a patent infringement judgment against
Apple and unspecified monetary damages. Apple doesn’t comment on
pending litigation, said spokesman  Steve Dowling .  
 The case is Emblaze Ltd. v Apple Inc., 10-cv-5713, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
