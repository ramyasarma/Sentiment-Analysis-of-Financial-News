             CSR Plc , a maker of chips used in
Nokia Oyj mobile phones, fell the most in almost two years in
London trading after giving revenue guidance lower than
analysts’ estimates on “growing caution” about the economy.  
 CSR dropped  as much as 15 percent, the most since September
2008. Third-quarter revenue is expected to be from $220 million
to $235 million, the Cambridge, England-based company said in a
statement distributed by the Regulatory News Service today. The
median  estimate  of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for
sales of $239 million.  
 “We have seen growing caution in the macro economic
outlook for the second half of 2010,” Chief Executive Officer
 Joep van Beurden  said in the statement. “At the same time, we
and others in the industry are seeing foundry capacity becoming
increasingly constrained, largely as a result of their limited
investment made in new capacity during 2009.”  
 Second-quarter revenue increased to $220.7 million, from
$112.9 million. Profit was $13.3 million, compared with a loss
of $29 million a year earlier.  
 “We have reduced our full-year revenue expectation
slightly, but this is offset by stronger gross margins and lower
tax,”  Nick James , an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said in a note.
Panmure Gordon continues to have a “buy” recommendation on the
stock.  
 CSR fell as much as  61.8 pence to 352.9 pence and traded at
363.9 pence as of 10:20 a.m. The stock has lost 11 percent this
year, valuing the company at 671.7 million pounds ($1 billion).  
 CSR also announced the acquisition of APT Licensing Ltd., a
Belfast, Northern Ireland-based audio technology company, in a
separate statement distributed by Business Wire today.
