             Dana Petroleum Plc Chief Executive
Officer Thomas Cross has not persuaded shareholders to wait for
an offer better than the 1,800-pence-a-share proposed by Korea
National Oil Corp., the Wall Stree Journal reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.  
 Dana advised investors on Friday not to take action, citing
concerns about the Korean company’s financing and conditions
that include Dana’s agreeing not to solicit other offers for
four weeks after the beginning of due diligence and allowing
KNOC to match any rival offer, the newspaper said.  
 Cross’s meetings with key shareholders yesterday and today
did not convince them that the concerns are sufficient to
scuttle the deal, which values Dana at 1.67 billion pounds ($2.6
billion), or that there is another valid deal in the works, the
Journal said, citing the people familiar.
