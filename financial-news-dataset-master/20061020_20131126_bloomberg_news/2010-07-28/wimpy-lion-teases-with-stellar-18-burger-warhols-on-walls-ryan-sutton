             In my book, any restaurant guarded
by a doorman clutching a list of names is suspect. Is The Lion,
a newly revived Manhattan restaurant, posing as a club? Or is it
vice versa? Whatever the case, I wasn’t getting in.  
 I wanted the Lion’s burger. Ever since I’d tried one a
month before, I hadn’t been able to get it out of my head.  
 The “special blend” fell apart so gently it was like a
beefy mound of cottage cheese. A musky, chewy slab of pork belly
added depth to the flavor and heft to the feel. Caramelized
onions and oozing cheddar made it practically a religious
experience costing $18. Add basil-scented fries and it would’ve
been $26.  
 That burger alone was enough to lure me back, but as I
said, I wasn’t getting in. It was 10:30 p.m. on a Thursday. The
high-heeled scrum out front was so dense it was impossible to
see down West 9th St.  
 Some entered. Some tried to enter. “They told me not to
let anyone else in,” the doorman said. He couldn’t give a wait
time. He didn’t invite me to come back.  
 Chef John DeLucie hasn’t quite given us another Waverly
Inn, that buzzing social club where he used to dish crispy
chicken to the bold-faced hangers-on of  Graydon Carter . Common
folk looking for a reservation were lucky to get through to
voice mail.  
 Baby Food  
 The Lion will take your calls and serve you expensive
American fare that’s generally better and cheaper elsewhere.
How’s a 10:45 p.m. reservation sound? Avoid mushy, bland tuna
tartare. Go for the chicken, which is just as good here as at
Waverly. A poultry jus begs to be mopped up by (undersalted)
biscuits.  
 Walk down into the Tavern Room. Watch Dan Abrams (an owner)
hang out by the host stand. Was that Regis Philbin fleeing into
the back room -- the Lion’s Den? That’s where the noise settles
down and if you’re famous like him, or happen to be lucky like
me, you might be taken up a staircase to the terrace, a balcony
overlooking a room filled with Basquiats, Warhols and the plebes
below.  
 I enjoyed watching the host relegate a young finance
executive to a table in the Tavern. He ordered the pork chop. I
can’t print the expletive he used to describe the $39 hunk of
meat.  
 Dry Chop  
 The dry, overcooked carnage bears no relation to the juicy,
medium rare cut offered at Waverly, where no doorman was paid to
keep me out.  
 Martinis arrive not quite lukewarm, but not quite cold
either. Oysters might lounge atop slushy, melted ice. A
companion scowled when I ordered her a piping hot lobster pie in
the dead of summer. The concoction involves a flaky crust with
chewy shellfish in bisque, which is to say it’s a $29 soup.  
 The menu doesn’t say what’s in the shellfish cassoulet.
Servers don’t say what’s in it, either. It’s too dark to tell
what’s on the plate. Anyway, skip it.  
 Apparently there was braised octopus flanking my rings of
pasta but you could’ve fooled me. The dish, sprinkled with
guanciale and lacking any unifying sauce, did its best
impression of a buffet salad.  
 Oregano Overload  
 The waiters also neglect to warn you about all the oregano
in the cavatelli, which gives the otherwise tasty dish the
unmistakable aroma of a Pizza Hut pie. Was the cote de boeuf for
two medium rare, as requested, or medium? Hard to tell given
such textureless meat and the low lighting. That’s a $98
mistake.  
 A lamb porterhouse ($43) arrived medium-rare as ordered but
lacked the curried, pan-sauced depth of flavor of the version at
Litte Owl, which charges $33.  
 In its heyday, The Lion was a cabaret hosting the likes of
 Barbra Streisand  and  Bette Midler . The desserts, perhaps a
throwback to those times, involve jarred cheesecake (that would
be watery cheesecake served, yes, in a jar), lemon meringue
(cloying) and a chocolate souffle (pedestrian).  
 I’m happy to let a new generation of scenesters blow their
cash here. It means more room for me at Waverly.
