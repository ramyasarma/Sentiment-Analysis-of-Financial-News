             Canon Inc.  rose the most in five
months in Tokyo trading after reporting profit that beat analyst
estimates.  
 The  shares  rose 4 percent to 3,655 yen as of 9:06 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the stock’s biggest gain since Feb. 17.  
 Net income more than quadrupled to 67.6 billion yen ($779
million) in the three months ended June 30 from a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based company said yesterday after the market closes.
That exceeded the 58 billion yen median of three analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg News.  
 “Canon’s result was a positive surprise,” Hisashi
Moriyama, a Tokyo-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote
in a report today. “Strong earnings had already been expected
but Canon showed an even bigger gain.” He raised the stock’s
rating to “overweight” from “neutral”.
