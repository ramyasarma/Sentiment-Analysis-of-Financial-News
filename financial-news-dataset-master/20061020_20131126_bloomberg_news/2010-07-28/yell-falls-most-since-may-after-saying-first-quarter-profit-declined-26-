             Yell Group Plc , the publisher of the
U.K.’s yellow pages directories, fell the most in more than two
months in London trading after saying first-quarter profit fell
26 percent on lower sales.  
 Yell dropped  as much as 16 percent, the most since May 18.
Net income fell to 11.1 million pounds ($17.3 million) from 14.9
million pounds a year earlier, the Reading, England-based
company said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.
Revenue declined 7.5 percent to 439.6 million pounds.  
 “The anticipated economic recovery is proving slower than
expected,” the company said in today’s statement.  
 Yell has seen sales retreat as advertisers cut spending on
print listings. In May, the company said Chief Executive Officer
 John Condron  and Chief Financial Officer  John Davis  are going to
leave.  
 The company’s second quarter is now “largely sold” and
Yell expects the rate of “organic decline” at constant
exchange rates to be about 11 percent, the publisher said today.
For the third quarter the company forecasts an organic decline
of about 9 percent.  
 Yell retreated as much as 4.93 pence to 25.26 pence and
traded at 26.11 pence as of 8:30 a.m. The stock has retreated 32
percent this year, giving the company a market value of 626.8
million pounds.
