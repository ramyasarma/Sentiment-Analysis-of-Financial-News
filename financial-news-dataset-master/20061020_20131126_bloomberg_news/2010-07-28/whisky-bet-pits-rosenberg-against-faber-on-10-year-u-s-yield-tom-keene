             Economist  David Rosenberg  and
investor  Marc Faber  have wagered a bottle of scotch whisky on
whether U.S. 10-year Treasury yields can go lower than 2
percent.  
 Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates
Inc., predicted yields on the 10-year note will drop to less
than 2 percent. Faber, the publisher of the Gloom, Boom & Doom
report, said he doesn’t believe they’ll fall to less than
December 2008’s low of 2.08 percent. They have put booze on the
line.  
 “If I lose the bet, I buy him a bottle of Cutty Sark, and
if I win, I want a bottle of Dalwhinnie,” Rosenberg, 49, said
during a radio interview today with  Tom Keene  on “Bloomberg
Surveillance.”  
 If there’s a surprise in the next year, Rosenberg said,
it’s going to be a slowdown in growth as opposed to
acceleration.  
 “When I look at the contours and components of the
consumer price index, I think inflation and core are going to
grind down toward zero,” Rosenberg said. “If you look at the
historical records, you’ll see that long-term bond yields are
usually priced about 200 basis points above the rate of
inflation.”  
 Recession Call  
 Rosenberg is known for having been early in predicting the
recession. In a 2008 Bloomberg survey of 55 forecasters, his
predictions for economic output, inflation and unemployment were
among the more bearish. That year Rosenberg was ranked as the
No. 1 economist by Brendan Wood International, which surveyed
Canadian portfolio managers, and No. 2 by Institutional Investor
magazine.  
 Faber, the 64-year-old who is credited with predicting the
1987 Black Monday stock market crash, said if the economy slows
into a double-dip recession and there are serious deflationary
pressures, additional government stimulus packages will drive
prices up.  
 “This, in the long run, will be inflationary so I would
rather play the short side of the bond market one year out than
the long side,” Faber said in a separate interview today on
“Bloomberg Surveillance.”  
 The U.S. 10-year note will rise to 3.35 percent by the end
of the year, according to the median forecast of 61 economists
by Bloomberg News. The yield fell to 3.04 percent at 10:03 a.m.
in New York. It touched 2.85 percent on July 21, the lowest
since April 2009.  
 “We’re going to hit those levels, the question is when,”
Rosenberg said about yields approaching 2 percent. “If I didn’t
believe it, I wouldn’t have made the bet.”
