             China’s sales of 30-year debt today
attracted strong demand than last month’s auction as insurance
companies and banks boosted orders after a cash shortage eased.  
 The 28 billion-yuan ($4.1 billion) debt sale drew bids for
1.91 times the amount on offer, compared with 1.41 times at the
last sale of similar-maturity notes on June 18. The average
yield fell to 3.96 percent, from 4.03 percent last time. The
seven-day repurchase  rate , which measures lending costs between
banks, has declined about 1 percentage point to a 12-week low of
1.69 percent during the period.  
 “Insurers have a natural preference for very long-term
debt and their premium income rose,” said  Chen Jianheng , a bond
analyst at China International Capital Corp., the nation’s first
Sino-foreign investment bank in Beijing. “ Banks’ demand also
increased as they have more cash now than a month ago.”  
 China’s insurance companies posted first-half premiums of
799.9 billion yuan, an increase of 33.6 percent from a year
earlier, the industry’s regulator reported July 19. CICC’s Chen
said insurers typically demand investment returns of at least 4
percent to cover their costs.  
 The average yield at today’s auction was in line with the
median 3.96 percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 17 finance
companies.
