             Brazil’s real fluctuated between
gains and losses as a global rally in commodity prices offset a
decline in U.S. durable goods orders that sparked concern of a
slowdown in the global economic recovery.  
 The real rose 0.1 percent to 1.7657 per dollar at 9:21 a.m.
New York time, from 1.7672 yesterday. The currency has gained
6.5 percent in the past 12 months.  
 New orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods decreased 1
percent in June, the U.S. Census Bureau announced today. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 1 percent
increase. The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index of
26 raw materials jumped as much as 0.9 percent.  
 “Durable goods orders are a factor, as they did come out
on the soft side,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an emerging-markets
economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in Miami. “But the current
climate in Brazil remains very supportive of a stronger real.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 10.86 percent.
