             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  fell for a second day, dropping 94.22, or 0.3
percent, to 28,367.26 at the close in Johannesburg.  
 Trading closed one hour late at 6 p.m. local time yesterday
following a six-hour stoppage that resulted from technical
problems.  
 The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  
 ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd.  (ACL SJ), a unit of the
world’s largest steel producer, advanced for a seventh day,
rising 1.80 rand, or 2.1 percent, to 86.30 rand. That’s the
longest series of gains since December 2007. The company posted
a first-half profit of 1.78 billion rand ($242.6 million)
compared to a year-earlier loss of 848 million rand, according
to a stock exchange statement.  
 BHP Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest diversified
mining company, rose 2.41 rand, or 1.1 percent, to 228.90 rand.
Copper climbed to the highest price since mid-May on speculation
that economic growth will be resilient in China and the U.S.,
the world’s biggest metal users.  
 Gold Fields Ltd.  (GFI SJ), Africa’s second-largest producer
of the metal, snapped two days of declines, climbing 1.40 rand,
or 1.5 percent, to 96.30 rand. Gold rose in New York as the
lowest prices in almost three months spurred demand.  
 Gold One International Ltd.  (GDO SJ), a miner of the
precious metal, rallied 9 cents, or 5.5 percent, to 1.74 rand.
That’s the biggest increase since May 14. The company said it
produced a monthly record 5,981 ounces of gold at a record low
cost of $434 an ounce in June, according to a stock exchange
filing.  
 Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, fell 6 rand, or 2 percent, to 288.50 rand,
following two days of increases. Oil retreated as much as 2.1
percent to $75.90 a barrel in New York, extending declines after
a U.S. government report showed an unexpected advance in
inventories.  
 Wesizwe Platinum Ltd.  (WEZ SJ), which explores for the
precious metal, gained 4 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 1.80 rand.
Platinum rose as much as 0.5 percent to $1,545.50 an ounce.
