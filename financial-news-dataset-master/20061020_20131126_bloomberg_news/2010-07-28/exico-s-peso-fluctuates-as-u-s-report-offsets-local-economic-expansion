             Mexico’s peso declined for a second
day as durable goods orders fell in the U.S., the nation’s
largest trading partner, fueling speculation the economic
recovery is slowing down.  
 The peso fell 0.3 percent to 12.7163 per dollar at 5 p.m.
New York time, from 12.6843 yesterday. The decline pared the
peso’s gain against the dollar this year to 3.3 percent, the
second-best performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, behind Japan’s yen.  
 “This has been a very volatile period,” said  Bertrand Delgado , a senior economist at Roubini Global Economics LLC in
New York. “From surveys to data, there have been signs that the
U.S. economy is facing a slowdown in the second half.”  
 Total orders for durable goods in the U.S. dropped 1
percent in June. The measure was expected to increase 1 percent,
based on the median forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News. The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  
 The yield on the 10 percent bonds due in 2024 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.92 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.13 centavo to 127.96 centavos per peso.  
 The central bank kept its inflation and economic growth
forecasts unchanged through next year, the bank said in a report
released today. The economy may grow 3.2 percent to 4.2 percent
next year, and 4 percent to 5 percent this year.  
 Consumer prices will rise as much as 5.25 percent in the
third and fourth quarters of this year, exceeding policy makers’
inflation target of 3 percent.
