             The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
fall as much as 15 percent in the next 10 weeks and investors
should use further gains in equities as an opportunity to sell,
technical analysts at UBS AG said.  
 UBS analysts  Michael Riesner  and Marc Mueller reiterated
their forecast that the U.S. benchmark gauge may decline to
between 944 and 1,000, in a report dated yesterday. The gauge
retreated for the first time in four days yesterday, slipping
0.1 percent to 1,113.84, after consumer confidence slid to a
five-month low.  
 “Anticipating another strong tactical down-leg below 1,000
in the S&P 500, we are sticking to our recent comments and would
use any kind of strength in July to sell,” Zurich-based Riesner
and Mueller wrote.  
 The analysts looked at the  McClellan oscillator  to
determine the S&P 500 is “approaching overbought extremes.”
The McClellan oscillator is a market breadth indicator based on
exponential moving averages of advance/decline lines. The
current level of the measure is 239.59, which is in the
overbought zone,  Bloomberg data  shows.  
 “Our cyclical models are still pointing to an important
low in the VIX index in late July/early August, which implies
that risk assets are about to move into an important tactical
top in the next 5 to 10 trading sessions,” the analysts wrote.  
 The  VIX , as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is know, measures the cost of protecting against declines
in the S&P 500. The gauge rose 2 percent yesterday after falling
for three consecutive days.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. UBS is ranked as the top bank for
equity technical analysis and charting according to a 2010
Thomson Extel survey.
