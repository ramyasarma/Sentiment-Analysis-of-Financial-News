             Raw sugar climbed on speculation
that rising Asian demand will deepen a shortfall that drove
prices to a four-month high.  
 The Philippines may auction rights as early as July 30 to
import 100,000 metric tons. Pakistan is allowing traders to
import 500,000 tons without duties until Nov. 30. Yesterday,
futures reached 19.05 cents a pound, the highest level since
March 19.  
 “There is some tightness in the market,” said  Robin Rosenberg , a futures and options strategist at PFG Best
Research, a brokerage in Chicago. “I am cautiously friendly”
on prices, he said.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery climbed 0.45 cent, or 2.4
percent, to close at 18.87 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price has gained 17 percent this
month.  
 Refined-sugar futures for October delivery rose $3.90, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $570.50 a ton on the Liffe exchange in
London at 5:30 p.m. local time.
