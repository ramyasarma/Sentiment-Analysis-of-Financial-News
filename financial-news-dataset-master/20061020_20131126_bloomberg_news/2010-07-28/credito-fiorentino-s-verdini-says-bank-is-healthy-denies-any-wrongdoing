             Credito Cooperativo Fiorentino SC’s
former Chairman  Denis Verdini , one of three coordinators of
Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s People of Liberty
party, denied any wrongdoing after the bank was put under state
administration yesterday.  
 “I did nothing wrong,” Verdini said today in Rome during
a two-hour press conference. “There’s no money missing; its
capital is intact. The bank will continue functioning the same
way it did when I managed it.”  
 The Florence-based lender was put under state
administration after Verdini resigned as chairman on July 23,
and the management board stepped down on July 26. Verdini is
under investigation for allegedly rigging tenders for wind-power
plants on the island of Sardinia and being part of a secret
society aimed at defrauding the state.  
 Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  yesterday signed a decree
putting the local lender under state control. The Bank of Italy
had asked the government to take action after an inspection
showed “serious violations” at the bank.
