             Hong Kong stocks  rose, reversing a
drop, as banks extended a global rally in financial stocks amid
speculation reforms in the sector won’t be as harsh as
previously thought.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest lender by market value,
climbed 2.6 percent after the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision softened proposed capital and liquidity rules,
boosting bank stocks worldwide. China Resources Cement Holdings
Ltd. surged 6.5 percent after the Economic Information Daily
reported a government development plan for the cement industry.
 Hang Lung Properties Ltd.  led developers lower after posting
earnings that missed estimates and as the government sold a
building site at the Peak for a less-than-expected HK$10.4
billion ($1.34 billion) at an auction.  
 The  Hang Seng Index  climbed 0.6 percent to 21,091.18 at the
close, after falling as much as 0.3 percent. That’s the gauge’s
highest close since April 30.  
 “Basel is definitely the reason,” said  Steven Leung ,
director of institutional sales at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. “Long
funds have been coming back since mid-last week, chasing
commodities, cement, copper.”  
 The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies advanced 0.4 percent to 11,972.75.  
 The Hang Seng Index has dropped 3.6 percent this year as
China’s efforts to cool its property market and Europe’s debt
crises dented confidence in a global economic recovery. Stocks
on the gauge trade at  14 times  estimated earnings, Bloomberg
data show, down from 17.2 times at the beginning of the year.  
 Basel Relaxes Stance  
 Twenty-one stocks gained among the measure’s 43
constituents, while 19 fell. Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose
0.4 percent to 21,051.  
 HSBC climbed 2.6 percent to HK$80.90.  Standard Chartered
Plc , a London-based bank, gained 3.3 percent to HK$232,
extending a six-day, 9.8 percent advance.  
 The Basel Committee, which represents central banks and
regulators in 27 nations and sets capital standards for lenders
worldwide, agreed July 26 to allow certain assets, including
minority stakes in other financial firms, to count as capital,
according to a statement.  
 China Eastern Airlines Corp. , the nation’s second-largest
carrier, surged 5 percent to HK$4.18. Morgan Stanley raised its
recommendation on the stock to “equal-weight” from
“underweight.”  
 Cement, Power Stocks  
 China Resources Cement advanced 6.5 percent to HK$3.77.
 Anhui Conch Cement Co. , China’s biggest cement maker, gained 3.4
percent to HK$27.50. China National Building Material Co., a
cement maker, increased 2.7 percent to HK$14.54.  
 China aims to eliminate inefficient cement capacity and
close polluting factories, according to the Economic Information
Daily.  
 Wasion Group Holdings Ltd. , which makes electricity meters,
surged 10 percent to HK$6.14, the  biggest advance  on the Hang
Seng Composite Index. Harbin Power Equipment Co., the maker of
power generation equipment, increased 4.9 percent to HK$6.60.  
 Morgan Stanley said suppliers of electricity-generating
equipment look “attractive,” saying utility companies will
boost their capacities to meet growing electricity demand.  
 Peak Sport Products Ltd. , the Chinese sportswear maker that
sponsors basketball players including  Shane Battier  and  Jason Kidd , climbed 8.5 percent to HK$5.50. Sales may rise another 20
percent this year, gauging from the same-store sales growth
reported by the company on July 9, Hayman Chiu, an analyst at
brokerage Cinda International Holdings Ltd, said.  
 Property Auction  
 Hang Lung Properties Ltd. , Hong Kong’s third-biggest
homebuilder, declined 3.1 percent to HK$32.60, leading property
developers lower.  
 The company said during the midday break that net income
excluding revaluation gains and deferred tax rose to HK$6.67
billion ($859 million) in the 12 months to June 30 from HK$2.39
billion a year earlier. That fell short of the average estimate
of HK$6.96 billion from 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Other developers also dropped after the government sold a
block of land on Mt. Nicholson Road in the Peak district for
HK$10.4 billion. That’s below the HK$10.5 billion median
estimate of seven analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. , the world’s biggest developer,
slipped 1.1 percent to HK$113.20. Henderson Land Development Co.,
the flagship company of Hong Kong billionaire  Lee Shau-kee ,
dropped 1 percent to HK$48.20.  
 Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co. , also known as Haeco,
fell 1.9 percent to HK$103 after Swire Pacific Ltd. scrapped
plans to buy out the company. Swire Pacific, the biggest
shareholder in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., was unchanged at
HK$94.35.
