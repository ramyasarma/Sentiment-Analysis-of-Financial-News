             Corning Inc.,  the world’s biggest
maker of glass for flat-panel televisions, reported second-
quarter profit and sales that topped analysts’ estimates as
customers resumed buying TVs.  
 Profit rose to 58 cents a share, the Corning, New York-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts predicted 53
cents on  average , according to a Bloomberg survey. Sales climbed
23 percent to $1.71 billion.  
 Demand for liquid-crystal displays, 45 percent of annual
 revenue , will be at the high end of Corning’s forecast for the
year, the company said last week. Glass demand, measured in
square feet, will be unchanged this quarter compared with a year
earlier as customers make “minor” inventory reductions, Senior
Vice President  Tony Tripeny  said today in a telephone interview.  
 “TV sales are pretty decent -- still growing quarter on
quarter,” said  Vijay Rakesh , an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach
in Chicago who recommends buying the stock. “The momentum’s
slowing, but they’re still growing.”  
 Corning  fell 34 cents to $17.66 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The  shares  have declined
8.5 percent this year.  
 Net income climbed to $913 million from $611 million, or 39
cents, a year earlier. Analysts predicted sales of $1.65 billion
on average.  
 Sales of liquid-crystal displays climbed 24 percent to $834
million.
