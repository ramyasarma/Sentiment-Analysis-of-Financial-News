             Newmont Mining Corp. , the largest
U.S. gold producer, reported second-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates after rain curbed Indonesian output and
production was lower than expected at an Australian mine.  
 Net income climbed to $382 million, or 77 cents a share,
from $162 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier, the Greenwood
Village, Colorado-based company said in a statement today. That
trailed the 84-cent  average estimate  of five analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Sales rose 34 percent to $2.15 billion.  
 Gold production from the company’s Batu Hijau mine in
Indonesia decreased 6.8 percent to 82,000 ounces from 88,000
ounces in the first quarter due to unusually heavy rainfall in
the area, the company said. Gold output at Newmont’s Boddington
mine in Australian was less than expected.  
 Newmont  fell  2 cents, or 0.04 percent, to $55.76 at 10:48
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading, after earlier dropping
as much as 2.7 percent. The shares advanced 18 percent this
year, giving Newmont a market capitalization of $27.4 billion.  
 Newmont said it will raise its quarterly  dividend  to 15
cents a common share from 10 cents. The company reiterated its
2010 gold production outlook of 5.3 million to 5.5 million
ounces and said it was “essentially maintaining” its forecast
for operating costs and capital spending.  
 The dividend increase “reflects the confidence we have in
our ability to fully fund our project pipeline and exploration
programs, keep the door open to value-creating acquisition
opportunities and return capital to shareholders,” Chief
Executive Officer  Richard O’Brien  said in the statement.  
 Gold Record  
 Gold for immediate delivery in London traded as high as
$1,265.30 an ounce on June 21 as investors bought the precious
metal to hedge against a weakening euro amid concern over
Europe’s debt crisis. Gold averaged $1,197 in the quarter, 30
percent higher compared with a year earlier.  
 Gold has advanced 39 percent since 2008 while the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  has climbed 26 percent as investors sought
protection from falling stock markets.
