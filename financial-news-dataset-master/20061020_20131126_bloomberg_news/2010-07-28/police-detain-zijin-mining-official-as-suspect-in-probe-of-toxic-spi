             Zijin Mining Group Co. , blamed for
the industry’s worst waste leakage in China in two years, said
company Vice President  Chen Jiahong  was detained yesterday by
the police.  
 Chen, formerly head of the Zijinshan gold and copper mines
in Fujian province, was held as a suspect in relation to “the
major pollution incident,” according to a statement to Hong
Kong’s stock exchange today.  
 China’s biggest gold producer was forced to  shut its
copper plant  at Zijinshan this month after acid-laced waste
spilled from the site, poisoning a river. The company said
yesterday that it had also agreed to limit production at a gold
mine in the area to reduce environmental risks.  
 Zijin rose 3 percent to close at HK$5.14 in Hong Kong today,
before the statement. The stock gained 2.5 percent to 5.86 yuan
in Shanghai.  
 The company said it received a notice today saying that
Chen had been detained.
