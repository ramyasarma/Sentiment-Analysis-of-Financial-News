             Infineon Technologies AG , Europe’s
second-largest chipmaker, raised its fiscal 2010 outlook for a
third time on semiconductor demand from makers of cars and
consumer electronics.  
 Infineon, which today reported a third-quarter  net income 
that beat analysts’ estimates, said in an e-mailed statement
that revenue growth this year will be in the “mid-to-high”
40s-percentage level. Sales fell 22 percent last year to 3
billion euros ($3.9 billion) as companies put spending on hold
and consumer demand dropped. The forecast assumes an exchange
rate of $1.3 to the euro.  
 “We have come a long way in improving profitability,”
Chief Executive Officer  Peter Bauer  said in today’s statement.  
 Infineon, like other chipmakers including Intel Corp. is
riding a revival in demand for semiconductors that power
everything from electronic toys to cars and industrial systems.
Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, this month reported record
second-quarter sales and topped analysts’ estimates with its
forecast, showing a rebound in technology spending.  
 Infineon’s full-year operating profit margin -- which the
company calls segment result margin -- will be a “low teens
percentage” of revenue, the Neubiberg, Germany-based company
said in today’s statement. Previously, Infineon said revenue
would grow by a “high 30s percentage” year-on-year, and the
operating margin would be higher than 10 percent.  
 Bauer said in the statement that Infineon is “now
beginning to take aim at our ambitious goal” of a margin at 15
percent.  
 In the third quarter ended June 30, the company had net
income of 126 million euros compared with a loss of 23 million
euros a year earlier.  
 The latest period was the company’s fourth consecutive
quarter of profit after  combined losses  of more than 3.9 billion
euros in the 10 previous quarters. The average estimate for net
income was 115 million euros, based on ten  analysts  surveyed by
Bloomberg.
