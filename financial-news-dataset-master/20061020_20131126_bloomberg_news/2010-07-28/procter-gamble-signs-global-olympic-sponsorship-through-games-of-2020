             Procter & Gamble Co. , the world’s
largest consumer-products company, agreed to become a worldwide
Olympic sponsor through 2020.  
 The 10-year sponsorship with the International Olympic
Committee covers the next five Games starting with London 2012,
the company and governing body said today in a joint statement.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  
 P&G becomes the 11th global sponsor for the  London
Olympics . The Cincinnati-based company sponsored the U.S. team
at this year’s Vancouver Winter Olympics.  
 “P&G’s global reach and consumer insight will be a real
boost in our efforts to communicate the Olympic values to a
worldwide audience and their financial support over the next
decade will benefit the entire Olympics movement, including the
athletes themselves,” IOC President  Jacques Rogge  said in the
statement.  
 The IOC’s Worldwide Olympic Partners get exclusive
marketing rights in their product category. Among P&G’s global
brands are Gillette shavers, Duracell batteries, Pampers diapers
and Pantene shampoo.  
 P&G is the second new Olympic sponsor announced this month
after Dow Chemical Co. The other sponsors for London 2012 are
Coca-Cola, Acer, Atros Origin, General Electric, McDonald’s,
Omega, Panasonic, Samsung and Visa.
