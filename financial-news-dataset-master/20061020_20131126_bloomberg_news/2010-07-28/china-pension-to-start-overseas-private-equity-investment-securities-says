             Dai Xianglong, chairman of the
National Council for Social Security Fund, said the pension fund
will begin investing in overseas private-equity funds soon, the
Shanghai Securities News reported today.  
 The pension fund is now looking for managers and has plans
to increase the scale of its investments in overseas private-
equity funds once they’ve started, the newspaper reported,
citing Dai. China’s pension fund will focus mainly on investing
in overseas small and medium-sized enterprises, Dai was cited as
saying.
