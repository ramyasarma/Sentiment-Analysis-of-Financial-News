             Alberto Contador, who’s won the Tour
de France for the third time in four years, will leave his
Astana cycling team at the end of this season after rejecting an
offer to extend his contract, the Associated Press reported.  
 The 27-year-old Spaniard said in a statement he’ll study
all options for the coming seasons “calmly,” the AP added.  
 Three days ago Contador completed his victory in the Tour
de France, beating second-placed Andy Schleck of Luxembourg by
39 seconds. In 2008, he won the Giro d’Italia and Vuelta a
Espana, the other major cycling tours.   
 A spokesman for Kazakhstan-backed Astana couldn’t be
reached by phone by Bloomberg News and an e-mail seeking comment
wasn’t immediately returned.
