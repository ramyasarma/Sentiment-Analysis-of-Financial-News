             Banco Bradesco SA , Brazil’s second-
biggest bank by market value, gained the most in three weeks
after saying second-quarter profit increased 23 percent as
lending expanded in Latin America’s largest economy.  
 Adjusted  net income,  which excludes one-time events, rose
to 2.46 billion reais ($1.39 billion), or 2.19 reais a share,
from 2 billion reais, or 2.06 reais a share, a year earlier, the
Osasco, Brazil-based bank said today in a regulatory filing.
That exceeds the  mean estimate  of 2.26 billion reais in a
Bloomberg  survey  of four analysts. Net income rose 4.7 percent
to 2.41 billion reais.  
 Bradesco gained 4.5 percent to 32.20 reais, the most since
July 7. This compares with a 0.2 percent rise for the benchmark
Bovespa stock index and a 2.3 percent advance for  Itau Unibanco
Holding SA , Brazil’s biggest bank by market value.  
 “Main drivers of Bradesco’s result were sound top-line
growth on the back of good credit expansion, strong insurance
performance and recovery trading gains as well as lower
provisions on a significant asset quality improvement,” wrote
Bank of America analyst Jorg Friedmann in a note to clients
today, in which he reiterated his “buy” rating.  
 Brazilian bank lending rose for the 16th straight month in
June to a record of 1.53 trillion reais, led by loans made by
the state development bank, BNDES, and mortgages, the central
bank said yesterday. Bradesco’s loans expanded 15 percent to
244.8 billion reais in the quarter, while total assets increased
16 percent to 558.1 billion reais.  
 “Bradesco continues to enjoy a solid capital ratio,”
 Eduardo Nishio  and  Eduardo Rosman , analysts at Banco BTG Pactual
SA, wrote in a July 21 note to clients. “Macroeconomic
fundamentals are constructive, allowing the bank to comfortably
accelerate growth in 2010-2011. We expect the bank to post the
strongest loan growth among large banks, with 24 percent in
2010.”
