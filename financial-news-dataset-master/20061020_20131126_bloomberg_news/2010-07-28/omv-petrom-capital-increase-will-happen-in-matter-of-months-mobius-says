             OMV Petrom SA ’s planned capital
increase of as much as 600 million euros ($779 million) will
take place in “a matter of months,” said  Mark Mobius , who is a
member of the Romanian oil company’s supervisory board.  
 The plan “is on schedule” and property fund Fondul
Proprietatea SA, which owns 20.1 percent in Romania’s biggest
oil company, will subscribe to the share-capital increase,
Mobius said in an interview today in Bucharest. Austria’s  OMV AG 
owns 51 percent of Petrom’s shares, while the Romanian state
owns 20.6 percent.  
 Petrom shareholders approved a mandate for the management
board to sell new shares over one year as of April, Petrom said
in a statement on April 30. Funds from any capital increase at
the Bucharest-based company would be used to maintain funds for
investments, which are estimated at 6.9 billion lei ($2.1
billion) for this year and between 1.2 billion euros and 1.5
billion euros over the next years, according to the company.  
 Mobius’s Templeton Asset Management Ltd. was hired by the
Romanian state manage the Fundul Proprietatea’s portfolio.
