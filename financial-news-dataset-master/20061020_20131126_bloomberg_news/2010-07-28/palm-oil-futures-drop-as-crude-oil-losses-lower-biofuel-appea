             Palm oil futures dropped after crude
oil fell for a second day on rising U.S. inventory, lowering the
appeal of the vegetable oil as a biodiesel feedstock.  
 October-delivery futures declined as much as 0.6 percent to
2,470 ringgit ($773) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. The most-active contract ended the morning session at
2,488 ringgit.  
 Oil dropped the most in more than three weeks yesterday as
the Conference Board said confidence among the U.S. consumers
waned. Crude oil for September delivery dropped as much as 0.8
percent to $76.88 a barrel today in New York.  
 “We may not see a huge decline in palm oil as festival
buying remains strong,” said  Amol Tilak , an analyst at Kotak
Commodity Services Ltd. in Mumbai. “Indian demand is on the
rise and China is certain to buy more as they no longer import
soybean oil from Argentina.”  
 China in April banned Argentine soybean oil imports in
retaliation for anti-dumping probes on products ranging from
elevators to textiles. Argentina is the largest exporter of
soybean oil and China is the commodity’s biggest consumer.  
 Palm oil has climbed 8.6 percent in the past two weeks on
speculation demand may rise among Asian countries and as weather
threatens to disrupt production in the biggest producers of the
tropical commodity. China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia mark
important festivals in the three months ending September, with
communal meals stoking edible oils consumption.  
 December-delivery soybean oil rose as much as 0.3 percent
after losing as much as 0.7 percent yesterday. The vegetable
oil’s  premium  over palm oil widened to $90.37 a ton from $85.30
yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.  
 CME Group Inc.’s October-delivery palm oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, lost 0.5 percent to $770 a ton
yesterday.  
 On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery palm oil
tumbled climbed 0.8 percent to 6,618 yuan ($976) a ton at 12:22
p.m. in Singapore, while soybean oil gained 0.4 percent to 7,592
yuan a ton.
