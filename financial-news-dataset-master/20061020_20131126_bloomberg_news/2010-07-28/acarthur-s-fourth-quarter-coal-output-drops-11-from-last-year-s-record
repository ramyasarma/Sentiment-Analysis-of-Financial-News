             Macarthur  Coal Ltd., the world’s
largest producer of pulverized coal used by steelmakers, said
fourth-quarter sales fell 11 percent from a record a year ago.  
 Sales totaled 1.32 million metric tons in the three months
to June 30, from 1.48 million tons a year ago, Brisbane-based
Macarthur said today in a statement.  
 “The June 2009 quarter was a sales record due to the sell
down of coal stocks to non-traditional utility customers during
the global financial crisis,” the company said.  
 Demand was “robust” during the quarter and full-year
production was a record 5.32 million tons, Macarthur said. The
company raised its full-year profit forecast this month as much
as 21 percent on the increased sales.  
 Macarthur shares rose 1 percent to A$13.05 at 10:13 a.m. in
Sydney. They’ve risen 16 percent this year.  
 Full-year sales rose 15 percent to 5.32 million tons after
improved loading at the Dalrymple Bay export terminal, the
company said. This compares with previous guidance of 4.8
million tons to 5 million tons. Macarthur operates three mines
in the Bowen Basin of Queensland state.  
 Peabody Energy Corp.  may revisit a takeover of Macarthur
after Australia’s government cut its planned mining profits tax,
UBS AG said this month. Macarthur in May rejected a reduced
A$3.8 billion ($3.4 billion) offer from Peabody.
