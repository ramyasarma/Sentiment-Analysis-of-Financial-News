             Russian billionaire Suleiman
Kerimov, who with partners owns a controlling stake in OAO
Uralkali, is seeking to add OAO Silvinit and Belaruskali to the
holding to create the world’s largest potash producer, Vedomosti
said.  
 Kerimov met with Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko on
behalf of Uralkali and offered to buy 51% of state-owned
Belaruskali for $7.5 billion, Vedomosti said, citing an
unidentified person close to an Uralkali shareholder. Belarus
denied the meeting, the newspaper said, citing Lukashenko’s
spokesman Pavel Legkiy.  
 Kerimov is also in talks to buy Silvinit shares from board
member Petr Kondrashev, Vedomosti said, citing an unidentified
person close to Silvinit. The billionaire already owns 25
percent of the Russian potash producer, the newspaper said.  
 Anton Averin, a spokesman for Kerimov’s Nafta Moskva
investment company, declined to comment when called by Bloomberg
News. Anton Subbotin, a Silvinit spokesman, and Larissa
Belyaeva, an Uralkali spokeswoman, also declined to comment.
