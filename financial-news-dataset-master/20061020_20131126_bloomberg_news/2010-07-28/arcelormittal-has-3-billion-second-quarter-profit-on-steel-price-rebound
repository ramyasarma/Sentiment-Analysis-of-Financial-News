             ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest
steelmaker, posted a second-quarter profit as higher metal
prices and increased demand boosted sales.  
 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization were $3 billion, compared with the $2.94
billion average of 16 analysts’ estimates Bloomberg compiled.
