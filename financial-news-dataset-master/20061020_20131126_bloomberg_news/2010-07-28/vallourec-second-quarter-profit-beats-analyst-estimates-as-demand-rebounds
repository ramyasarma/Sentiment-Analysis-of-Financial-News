             Vallourec SA , a French producer of
steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, posted second-quarter
profit that exceeded analyst estimates as demand rebounded.  
 Net profit rose to 125.9 million euros ($164 million), from
123.9 million euros a year before, the company, based in
Boulogne Billancourt, France, said today in a statement. The
result compares with the average of  116.8 million  euros among
seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “We have reacted quickly to meet the strong rebound in
activity in all our markets during the second quarter,”
Chairman  Philippe Crouzet  said in the statement. “We expect
most of our plants to operate at high utilization rates during
the second half of the year.”  
 The company has set aside capital expenditure of 160
million euros to expand its V&M Changzhou plant in Jiangsu
province, China. The project will allow the production of 60,000
metric tons of seamless pipes a year to meet local demand for
power plants, Vallourec said in a separate statement.
