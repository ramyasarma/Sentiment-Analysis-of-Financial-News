             Kenyan Prime Minister  Raila Odinga ,
who underwent head surgery last month, will travel to a private
location outside of the capital, Nairobi, for “a few days” to
help aid his recovery, his office said.  
 Doctors ordered Odinga, 65, to “get the full rest that has
been emphasized as a necessity for his full recovery,”
according to an e-mailed statement from his office today. He
will return home by the end of the week, it said.  
 Odinga has been recovering from surgery last month to
remove a blood clot on the outside of his brain. Before that, he
had been travelling in the East African nation to urge voters to
approve a new constitution in an Aug. 4 referendum. He is
expected to return to the campaign, the statement said.  
 Odinga became prime minister after signing a power-sharing
accord with President  Mwai Kibaki  in 2008 to end two months of
ethnic fighting sparked by a disputed election that killed as
many as 1,500 Kenyans and forced 300,000 to flee their homes.
