             Walt Disney Co.  said  Steve McPherson , president of its ABC Entertainment unit, has resigned
two months before the network’s new television season begins.  
 A replacement for McPherson will be named shortly, Burbank,
California-based  Disney  said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 ABC is adding six dramas to its schedule starting in
September after “Lost,” the network’s fifth-highest-rated
scripted show, concluded a six-year run in May. The network was
the only major U.S. broadcaster whose total audience declined
last season, and it’s also down among viewers aged 18 to 49, a
group sought by advertisers, according to Nielsen Co.  
 Disney, the world’s biggest media company, fell 12 cents to
$34.28 at 4 p.m. today in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 6.3 percent this year.
