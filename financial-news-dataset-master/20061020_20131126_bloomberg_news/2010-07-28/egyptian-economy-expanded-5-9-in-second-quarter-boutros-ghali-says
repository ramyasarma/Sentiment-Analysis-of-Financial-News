             Egypt’s economic growth accelerated
to 5.9 percent in the second quarter of 2010, boosted by
construction and telecommunications, Economic Development
Minister  Osman Mohamed Osman  said.  
 In the fiscal year that ended June 30, the economy grew 5.3
percent, Osman was cited as saying in a faxed statement from the
Cabinet today. The economy had been forecast to grow 5.2 percent
in the year ending June 30, according to the median estimate of
eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Earlier today,  Youssef Boutros-Ghali  gave the same figure for second quarter growth in
a text message.  
 “The second quarter is higher than what we were
expecting,” Reham El-Desoki, senior economist at Cairo-based
investment bank Beltone Financial, said by telephone today.  
 The economy of the most populous Arab country expanded at
an average rate of 7 percent in the three fiscal years through
June 2008, helped by foreign investment and revenue from tourism
and the Suez Canal. Growth slowed to 4.7 percent in the year
ending June 2009 due to the global financial crisis.  
 The government says it needs a growth rate of about 7
percent to create enough jobs for the 750,000 people who enter
the workforce every year. Unemployment is 9 percent, according
to the state statistics agency.  
 Construction grew 13 percent, transport advanced 6.8
percent, telecommunications rose 12 percent and transport added
6.8 percent in the fiscal year that ended June, Osman said.  
 The economy expanded 5.8 percent in the first quarter of
the year, compared with 5 percent in the previous three months,
Osman said in May.  
 Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30  Index gained 0.5 percent to
6,226.18 as of 4:25 p.m. in Cairo today.
