             Canada’s dollar erased a gain
against its U.S. counterpart after a drop in crude oil prices
increased speculation demand will wane for currencies of nations
that are dependent on commodities for growth.  
 The currency earlier rose as much as 0.5 percent versus the
greenback as  equities , copper and natural gas prices rose.
Stocks erased gains and crude oil futures extended declines
after a report showed a surge in inventories.  
 “The inventory data is quite a big spike,”  Sacha Tihanyi ,
a currency strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada’s third-
largest bank, said by phone from Toronto. “That’s probably why
we’re getting this little peak higher” in the greenback versus
the loonie.  
 The currency traded at C$1.0384 per U.S. dollar at 2:59
p.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0354 yesterday, when it
reached C$1.0256, the strongest level in more than a month. One
Canadian dollar buys 96.32 U.S. cents.  
 The currency, known as the loonie for the aquatic bird on
the one-dollar coin, lagged behind all but five of its 16 most-
traded counterparts. Portfolio rebalancing by asset managers
capped the loonie’s losses, Tihanyi said.  
 In the process, Tihanyi said fund managers with fixed
weightings of foreign assets sell the greenback to adjust for
the value of U.S. equities.  
 Up For Month  
 Crude for September delivery fell 0.4 percent to $77.17 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Supplies surged 7.31
million barrels to 360.8 million in the week ended July 23, the
Energy Department said today in a weekly report.  
 The loonie is up 2.7 percent versus the greenback this
month, only the 10th-best performing major, while the greenback
has declined against all 16 of its most-traded counterparts.
Year to date, the Canadian currency is up 1.6 percent.  
 Concern has receded that the European sovereign-debt crisis
will widen, just as recent U.S. economic data have called into
question the durability of the North American recovery.  
 Bookings for durable goods -- U.S. items meant to last at
least three years -- fell 1 percent last month after falling 0.8
percent in May, the Commerce Department reported today. The
median forecast of 76 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a 1 percent gain.  
 The spread between the Canadian government 2- and 10-year
bond yields held steady today at 1.63 percentage points. The so-
called  yield curve  ended July 9 at 1.51 percentage points, the
flattest on a closing basis since December 2008. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  
 The  MSCI World Index  of equities in 24 developed markets
fell 0.1 percent. Copper rose to an 11-week high at $7,196.25 a
metric ton. Natural gas futures climbed 2.1 percent to $4.774
per million British thermal units.  
 Canadian home prices rose 1.3 percent in May from the
previous month, the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price
Index showed. Prices rose 13.6 percent from May 2009, according
to a report released today by National Bank Financial.
