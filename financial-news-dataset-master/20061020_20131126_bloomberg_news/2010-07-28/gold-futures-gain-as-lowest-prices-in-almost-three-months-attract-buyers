             Gold rose in New York as the lowest
prices in almost three months spurred demand.  
 Futures yesterday fell the most in more than three weeks,
dropping as low as $1,160.80 an ounce, as a rally in global
equities eroded demand for bullion as an alternative investment.
Physical demand for gold from buyers in India, China and the
wider Asian region was “very visible” as prices declined this
week, UBS AG said today.  
 “From a risk-reward perspective, this level presents a
buying opportunity,” said  Bayram Dincer , an analyst at LGT
Capital Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland.  
 Gold futures for December delivery rose 60 cents to close
at $1,162.40 at 1:56 p.m. on the Comex in New York. Gold has
gained 6 percent this year and touched a record $1,266.50 an
ounce on June 21.  
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-
backed exchange-traded fund declined for a second day yesterday.
Assets under management have dropped 1.5 percent this month,
heading for the biggest decline since January.  
 “Any and all support for gold has been broken,” said
 Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter. Long-term investors “now have
several months of strong overhead resistance to overcome before
they regain the upper hand.”  
 Indian Demand  
 The drop in prices may be attractive to jewelers and
consumers in India, analysts said.  
 Yesterday and July 26 were the UBS sales desk’s strongest
two days since January for selling to India by volume, analyst
 Edel Tully  said today in an e-mailed report.  
 “The current decline in the gold price is probably only
short-lived,”  Eugen Weinberg , the head of commodity research
with Commerzbank AG, wrote in a report yesterday. “There are
some religious holidays from the end of August” in India, the
world’s largest gold consumer, which may propel demand, he said.  
 Silver futures for September delivery fell 18.5 cents, or 1
percent, to close at $17.441 an ounce at 1:30 p.m. in New York
on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $5, or 0.3
percent, to close at $1,541.70 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery gained $2.20, or
0.5 percent, to $468.75 an ounce at 1:30 p.m. in New York, also
on the Nymex.
