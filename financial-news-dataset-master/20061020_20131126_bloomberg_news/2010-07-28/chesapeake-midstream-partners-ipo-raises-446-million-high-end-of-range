             Chesapeake Midstream Partners LP , a
pipeline operator owned by the second-largest U.S. natural gas
producer, raised $446 million in its initial public offering
after pricing shares at the high end of the forecast range.  
 Chesapeake Midstream sold 21.3 million shares at $21 each
after offering them for $19 to $21, according to its  filing  with
the Securities and Exchange Commission and Bloomberg data. The
Oklahoma City-based company’s IPO will fund expansion of its
existing pipelines in Texas and its mid-continent region, which
includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, Delaware and Permian Basins.  
 Filings for initial offerings climbed to the highest since
2007 last quarter even as deals worldwide were canceled at the
fastest rate since the collapse of New York-based Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 7.3
percent this month.  
 UBS AG in Zurich and New York-based Citigroup Inc. and
 Morgan Stanley  led the offering, the filing showed. Chesapeake
Midstream starts trading tomorrow on the New York Stock Exchange
under the ticker CHKM.
