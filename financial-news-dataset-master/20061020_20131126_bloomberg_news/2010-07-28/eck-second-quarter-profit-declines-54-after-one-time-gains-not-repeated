             Teck Resources Ltd. , Canada’s
largest diversified miner, reported a 54 percent drop in second-
quarter profit after a one-time foreign exchange gain wasn’t
repeated.  
 Net income was C$260 million ($251 million), or 44 cents a
share, compared with C$570 million, or C$1.17, a year earlier,
Vancouver-based Teck said today in a statement. Earnings a year
earlier included a C$413 million after-tax foreign exchange gain
compared with a C$42 million loss this year, it said. Sales
gained 24 percent to C$2.11 billion.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Don Lindsay  plans to increase
annual coal output from mines in western Canada by 50 percent in
the next four years. The effort suffered a temporary setback on
June 28 when an explosion damaged part of a coal processing
plant at Teck’s Greenhills mine in southeastern British
Columbia. The blast won’t have a “significant impact” on
third-quarter or annual results, Teck said today.  
 “Coal is front and center for Teck,”  John Hughes , a
Toronto-based analyst at Desjardins Securities Inc., said before
the results were released.  
 Second-quarter sales increased 29 percent to 6.4 million
metric tons because of higher demand from contract customers and
China, the company said.  
 Profit excluding some one-time items was 55 cents a share,
missing the 60-cent  average estimate  of 14 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 Teck said on July 15 it was shipping coal from Greenhills
to another nearby mine for drying and blending to reduce the
effect of the accident on output. Teck had previously forecast
the mine would produce about 4.3 million metric tons of coal
this year, of which Teck’s share is about 3.4 million tons.  
 Copper, Zinc  
 Teck Resources fell 2.7 to C$35.90 in Toronto Stock
Exchange trading.  The shares  have declined 2.5 percent this
year.  
 The company, which also mines copper and zinc, said it sold
metallurgical coal used in steelmaking for an average of $182 a
metric ton in the quarter, up from $165 a year earlier and $140
in the first quarter, spurred by demand from China.  
 Sales  of metallurgical coal generated about 42 percent of
total revenue in the first quarter, followed by copper at 33
percent and zinc at 25 percent.
