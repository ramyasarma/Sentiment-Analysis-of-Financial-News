             Australia fly-half Quade Cooper
failed in his appeal against a two-match rugby ban, meaning
he’ll miss back-to-back Tri-Nations Tests against New Zealand.  
 Following a five-hour hearing today, a South African, New
Zealand and Australian Rugby appeals committee upheld Cooper’s
suspension for a dangerous tackle in the Wallabies’ 30-13 win
over the Springboks four days ago.  
 “After a lengthy teleconference hearing, and
deliberations, the committee dismissed the appeal,” SANZAR said
in an e-mailed statement.  
 Cooper will miss the July 31 and Aug. 7 matches against New
Zealand.  Matt Giteau  was yesterday named as his replacement at
fly-half to face the All Blacks in Melbourne in three days.
