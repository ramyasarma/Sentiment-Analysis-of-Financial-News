             Mexico’s central bank kept its
inflation and economic growth forecasts unchanged through next
year, saying it would wait for more economic data before making
any changes to its predictions.  
 The economy had a good second quarter and  exports  have been
vigorous this year, bank Governor  Agustin Carstens  told
reporters in Mexico City. The bank raised its forecast for job
creation this year to as high as 625,000, an increase of 25,000.  
 “We can’t rule out that there won’t be another episode of
instability in global markets that could be felt locally,”
Carstens said. “I would dare say that the balance of risks for
inflation going forward has improved.”  
 By keeping its inflation forecasts unchanged, Banco de
Mexico is indicating that it doesn’t expect a major change in
price pressures and is likely to keep its benchmark lending rate
on hold at 4.5 percent through the end of the year, said  Luis Arcentales , an economist at Morgan Stanley.  
 “They’re conveying that we haven’t clearly seen a break in
the inflationary system,” Arcentales said, speaking in a
telephone interview. “It’s just temporary factors.”  
 Policy makers kept their economic growth forecasts at
4 percent to 5 percent for this year and 3.2 percent to
4.2 percent for next year. The bank predicts a 2010  current
account deficit  of $8.3 billion and a  trade  deficit of
$7.9 billion.  
 The bank expects annual inflation as high as 5.25 percent
this year and as high as 3.25 percent next year. Policy makers
target inflation of 3 percent.  
 Bout of Deflation  
 The peso weakened 0.3 percent to 12.7163 per dollar as of
5 p.m. New York time.  
 Mexican prices declined every month of the second quarter,
the longest stretch of deflation since at least 1973, slowing
annual  inflation  to 3.69 percent in June.  
 While consumer prices rose in the first half of July, the
0.15 percent increase in the 15-day reading was lower than
analysts’ expectations for a 0.25 percent rise, according to the
median estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The central bank in April left its inflation forecast for
this year and 2011 unchanged after boosting price forecasts in
December by as much as 1.75 percentage points on faster economic
growth.  
 The bank this month kept its  benchmark interest rate 
unchanged for an 11th straight meeting, matching the bank’s
longest pause. Policy makers, in a  statement  accompanying their
decision, said that “an important part” of the reduction in
inflation had been driven by “seasonal and temporary effects.”  
 Economic Recovery  
 Latin America’s second-biggest economy is recovering from a
6.5 percent contraction last year, the biggest slump since 1932.
Industrial production has driven the rebound, helped by
increased U.S. demand, Carstens said.  
 Industrial production rose 8.4 percent in May from a year
earlier, according to the national statistics institute.  
 “Even if the U.S. stalls in coming quarters, the Mexican
economy seems to have sufficient momentum to at least match the
central bank’s conservative base scenario for GDP growth,”
Morgan Stanley said in a July 19 report.  
 Banco de Mexico will keep the overnight rate unchanged
until April of next year, when it will raise borrowing costs
0.25 percentage point, according to the median estimate of
analysts surveyed by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit.
