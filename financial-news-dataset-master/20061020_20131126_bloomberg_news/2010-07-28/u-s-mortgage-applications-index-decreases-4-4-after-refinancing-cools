             An index of mortgage applications in
the U.S. decreased last week as refinancing cooled after
borrowing costs jumped from a record low.  
 The Mortgage Bankers Association’s  index  fell 4.4 percent
in the week ended July 23, the Washington-based group said
today. The  refinancing  measure dropped 5.9 percent from the
prior week’s one-year high, while the  purchase  index rose 2
percent.  
 Demand for purchase financing has hovered near the 13-year
low reached earlier this month, showing the lowest mortgage
rates on record have yet to spur sales after the expiration of a
government tax credit. It will take gains in employment and in
consumer  confidence  to boost housing.  
 “The housing market is weak,” Paul Anastos, president of
Mortgage Master Inc., a Walpole, Massachusetts-based lender,
said in an interview before the report. “There’s good
opportunity out there in the housing market, but because
consumer confidence is fairly low, people aren’t really
shopping. They’re worried about other things, like jobs.”  
 The average rate on a  30-year fixed  loan increased to 4.69
percent from 4.59 percent the prior week, which was the lowest
since data began in 1990.  
 At the current rate, monthly payments for each $100,000 of
a loan would be about $518, down $41 from a year ago when the
rate was 5.36 percent.  
 Refinancing Share  
 The  share of applicants  seeking to refinance a loan fell to
78 percent last week from 79.4 percent the prior week, which was
the highest level since April 2009.  
 The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage rose to 4.12
percent from 4.05 percent, and the rate on a one-year adjustable
mortgage decreased to 7.15 percent from 7.17 percent.  
 New-home sales climbed to a 330,000 annual pace in June,
second only to the prior month’s pace as the lowest on record,
according to Commerce Department figures released on July 26.
Sales of new and existing homes have weakened since the
expiration of a federal homebuyers tax credit of up to $8,000,
which required contracts be signed by April 30.  
 NVR Inc. , based in Reston, Virginia, said last week the
original June 30 closing deadline to qualify for the tax
incentive resulted in a “surge in settlement activity” in the
second quarter, with closings jumping 63 percent from the same
time a year earlier. New orders fell 6 percent during the
period.
