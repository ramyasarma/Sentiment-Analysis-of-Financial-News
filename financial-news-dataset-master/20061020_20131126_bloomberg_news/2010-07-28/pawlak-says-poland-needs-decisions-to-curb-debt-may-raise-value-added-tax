             Poland’s government “needs
decisions” to keep public debt from exceeding legal limits next
year and may find it easiest to augment revenue by increasing
value-added tax rates, Economy Minister Waldemar Pawlak said
today in an interview on Polish Radio 3.  
 Pawlak said he hadn’t yet seen a long-term budget strategy
being prepared by the Finance Ministry that is to be approved by
the cabinet on Friday. He said he opposed any changes that would
increase tax rates on necessities such as food and medicine.
