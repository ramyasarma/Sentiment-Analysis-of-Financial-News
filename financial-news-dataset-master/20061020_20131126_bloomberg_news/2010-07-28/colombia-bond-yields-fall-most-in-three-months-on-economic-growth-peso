             Colombia’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields down the most in three months, as higher economic growth
forecasts and speculation the local currency will strengthen
further boosted appetite for the securities.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 7.56
percent at 3:23 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s
stock exchange. That’s the biggest drop since April 30. The
bond’s price jumped 1.143 centavos to 123.525 centavos per peso.  
 “Colombia is doing well, the economy is growing, inflation
is under control and now that there is less concern the central
bank will intervene, people continue to see the bonds as an
attractive investment,” said  Guillermo Puentes , head trader at
Banco de Comercio Exterior de Colombia SA, known as Bancoldex.  
 Central bank chief  Jose Dario Uribe  said after the July 23
monetary policy meeting that the bank raised this year’s
economic growth forecast by 1.5 percentage point to a range of
3.5 percent to 5.5 percent. He also said that Banco de la
Republica “has never ruled out intervening in the market
again.” The bank purchased $20 million a day between March 3
and June 30 to curb a rally policy makers said left the peso
“misaligned.”  
 The peso advanced 0.3 percent to 1,844.51 per U.S. dollar,
from 1,849.9 yesterday. The peso is up 10.8 percent this year,
the best performance among world currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  
 TES Auction  
 Colombia’s borrowing costs rose at a government debt
auction today of fixed-rated securities, known as TES.  
 The yield on the July 2024 bonds rose to 7.85 percent from
7.84 percent at the last auction on July 14, the Finance
Ministry said in a statement. The yield on the June 2016 bonds
increased to 7.22 percent from 7.13 percent at the previous
auction.  
 Demand for today’s auction was 1.37 trillion pesos ($743
million), about three times the 450 billion pesos offered.  
 Colombia will name  German Arce  public credit director after
President-elect  Juan Manuel Santos  takes office Aug. 7.  
 Arce, an economist who is vice president of marketing and
treasury at HSBC Colombia, said in a phone interview today he
accepted the post offered by designated Finance Minister  Juan Carlos Echeverry . He said he won’t be officially named until the
new government takes office.
