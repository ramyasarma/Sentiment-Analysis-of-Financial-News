             Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. , North
America’s largest iron-ore producer, said it’s still in talks
with customers about how they will pay for the steelmaking raw
material after a four-decade-old annual price system ended.  
 Changes to the pricing of iron ore and coking coal are
“resulting in a more fluid and uncertain near-term pricing
environment for these commodities,” the Cleveland-based company
said today in a statement.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’ largest mining company, has
led efforts this year to switch from annual, fixed prices for
coal and iron ore to contracts covering shorter periods,
allowing it to benefit sooner from rising prices.  
 While global steel production has recovered since last
year, the spot price for iron ore in China, the raw material’s
largest market, has dropped 24 percent in the past three months.  
 “The pricing model is in flux,”  John Stephenson , who
helps manage C$1.65 billion ($1.59 billion) at First Asset
Investment Management Inc. in Toronto, said in a telephone
interview. “Cliffs could be caught up in that.”  
 Net income  rose to $260.7 million, or $1.92 a share, from
$45.5 million, or 36 cents, a year earlier, Cliffs said.
Analysts expected net income of $2.02 a share, the average of
five  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey. Consolidated sales tripled
to $1.18 billion.  
 Cliffs fell 54 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.60 at 6:41 p.m.
after the close of regular New York Stock Exchange Trading.  The
shares  have gained 17 percent this year.
