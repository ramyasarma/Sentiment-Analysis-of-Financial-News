             Siemens AG , Europe’s largest
engineering company, said it plans to sell its Siemens
Electronics Assembly Systems unit to a subsidiary of  ASM
International NV .  
 The unit, which has 1,200 employees and produces equipment
for the electronics industry, is no longer considered a core
business for Siemens, the Munich-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  
 Hong Kong-based ASM Pacific Technologies Ltd. will pay 1
euro ($1.30) for the unit while Siemens will also provide 29
million euros as a “non-refundable cash-payment,” according to
a filing by ASM Pacific Technologies distributed through the
Hong Kong stock exchange.  
 Siemens Electronics Assembly Systems had 190.7 million
euros in sales for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2009, and a
net loss of 151.7 million euros, according ASM Pacific
Technologies’s statement.
