             China will order government reserves
to halt buying of domestic grain and oilseed products if prices
surge above set levels to maintain market order, the National
Development and Reform Commission said.  
 State-owned China Grain Reserve Corp., the top government
reserve manager, must improve its management of the reserve-
buying process and prevent contracted companies from breaking
rules for the sake of profit, the planning body said in a
 statement  on its website today.  
 Companies bid up prices of harvested summer grain recently
after bad weather in some regions, the commission said. This has
disrupted the grain market and made it more difficult for the
government to meet its inflation targets, it said.  
 “Some companies blindly chased each other and bid up
prices, causing farmers to hold off on selling and companies to
hoard,” the statement said. Reserves must halt government
procurement if prices exceed set floor limits, it said.  
 Regional grain and pricing authorities must also step up
inspection of the food reserve management process to stamp out
price manipulation, the statement said. Authorities must
investigate companies contracted by state reserves which
fabricated numbers or double-count grain purchases to earn more
subsidies, the commission said.
