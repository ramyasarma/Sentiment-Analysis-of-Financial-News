             National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC
climbed the most in almost four weeks after reporting a 10
percent increase in second-quarter profit, beating analysts’
estimates.  
 The shares of the second-biggest United Arab Emirates bank
by assets climbed 2.3 percent, the most since July 1, to 11.25
dirhams at 10:45 a.m. in Abu Dhabi.  
 Net income rose to 1 billion dirhams ($272 million) from
906.5 million dirhams a year earlier as the bank boosted
income from lending and set aside less money for bad loans.
That exceeded the median estimate of five analysts for a profit
of 920 million dirhams, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
