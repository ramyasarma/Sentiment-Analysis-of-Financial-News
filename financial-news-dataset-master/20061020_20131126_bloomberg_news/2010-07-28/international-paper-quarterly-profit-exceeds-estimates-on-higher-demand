             International Paper Co. , the world’s
largest pulp-and-paper producer, dropped the most in a month in
New York after it said second-quarter profit fell 32 percent
because of a charge to close a mill and as year-ago tax-credit
gains weren’t repeated.  
 International Paper  fell  $1.37, or 5.4 percent, to $24.12
at 4:15 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest percentage drop since June 29.  The shares  have declined
9.9 percent this year.  
 Net income  dropped to $93 million, or 21 cents a share,
from $136 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier, Memphis,
Tennessee-based International Paper said today in a statement.
Sales rose 5.5 percent to $6.12 billion.  
 The company’s earnings were affected by $68 million in
costs associated with the closing of the company’s mill in
Franklin, Virginia. A year ago, International Paper profit was
buoyed by a U.S. government tax-credit program to encourage the
use of non-fossil fuels such as black-liquor, a pulp residue.  
 Profit excluding the one-time items in the current quarter
was 42 cents a share. Analysts projected 41 cents, the average
of 14  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Chief Executive Officer  John Faraci  said a slowdown in the
pace of U.S. economic growth that the company detected in May
and June is extending into the current quarter.  
 “The economy is growing, no doubt about it, we are out of
the recession,” Faraci said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s InBusiness with Margaret Brennan. “We just see
growth in the third quarter not as robust or as strong as the
second quarter because there was some inventory building.  
 “I think all the macro signs show that things are slowing,
but they’re still positive,” he said. “We’re seeing a bit of a
slowdown in the rate of orders.
