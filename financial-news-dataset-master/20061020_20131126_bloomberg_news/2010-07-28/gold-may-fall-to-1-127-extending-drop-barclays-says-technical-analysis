             Gold may decline to $1,127 an ounce
in the next several weeks after falling below a so-called trend
line, according to technical analysis by Barclays Capital.  
 The attached chart shows the metal slid below its 100-day
moving average and yesterday dropped below a 21-month trend
line. The second chart shows prices may fall to the 200-day
moving average of about $1,148 and then to $1,127, according to
Barclays. The latter price would be a 23.6 percent retracement
of the metal’s rally from October 2008 to June this year, one of
the levels singled out in so-called Fibonacci analysis.  
 “The trend-line break is forcing a lot of people out of
their positions,”  MacNeil Curry , an analyst at Barclays, said
in an interview from New York. “People being washed out of
their positions may open up an opportunity for a stronger base
and subsequent move higher.”  
 Gold fell 8 percent since reaching a record $1,265.30 on
June 21 as investors reduced their  holdings  in the SPDR Gold
Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund backed by bullion, for
three consecutive weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Speculators including hedge funds  cut  their net-long position,
or bets prices will rise, in New York gold futures by 13
percent, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data for the week ended July 20.  
 Gold traded at $1,162.50 at 7:05 a.m. in London.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.
