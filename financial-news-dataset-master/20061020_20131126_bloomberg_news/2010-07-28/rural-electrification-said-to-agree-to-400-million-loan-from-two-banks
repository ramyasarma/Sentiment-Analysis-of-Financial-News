             Rural Electrification Corp. , India’s
state-owned lender to power projects, agreed to $400 million in
loans from two banks, according to two people with direct
knowledge of the matter.  
 Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. and State Bank of India
will each lend the New Delhi-based company $200 million, the
people said, declining to be identified because the matter is
private.  
 Lenders will receive an all-in payment of 175 basis points
more than the London interbank offered rate in dollars for the
loan, which will help the company meet its mandate to lend 280
billion rupees ($6 billion) to new power projects in India, one
of the people said. The loan is for five years, according to the
other person. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 State Bank of India spokesman  Pratip C. Chaudhuri  wasn’t
immediately available for comment when telephoned by Bloomberg
News. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ spokesman  Takashi Takeuchi 
said he couldn’t comment on an individual deal.
