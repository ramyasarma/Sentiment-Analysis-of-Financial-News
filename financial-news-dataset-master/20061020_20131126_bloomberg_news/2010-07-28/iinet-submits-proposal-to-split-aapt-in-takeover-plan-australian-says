             Iinet Ltd. has submitted a proposal
to split the retail and wholesale arms of AAPT, the Australian
unit of Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd., and is seeking to buy
its consumer business, the Australian newspaper reported, citing
unidentified sources close to the sale. Telecom NZ is
considering splitting the business and selling the wholesale
division into the National Broadband Network after TPG Telecom
Ltd.’s bid for all of AAPT failed to win approval, according to
the report.
