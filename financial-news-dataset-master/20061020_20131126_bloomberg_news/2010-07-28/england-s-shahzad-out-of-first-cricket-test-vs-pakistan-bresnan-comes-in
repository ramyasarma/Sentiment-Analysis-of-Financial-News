             England bowler Ajmal Shahzad has
been ruled out of the first cricket Test against Pakistan
because of an ankle injury. Tim Bresnan has been added to the
squad.  
 Shahzad has been withdrawn “as a precautionary measure,”
the England & Wales Cricket Board said in an e-mailed statement,
adding that he may be able to return for the second Test.  
 The opening match of the four-Test series starts tomorrow
in Nottingham.
