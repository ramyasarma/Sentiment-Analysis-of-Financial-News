             Vivo Participacoes SA  rallied the
most in six weeks after Telefonica SA agreed to buy Portugal
Telecom SGPS SA’s stake in the company and Vivo reported a 30
percent increase in second-quarter profit.  
 The company’s net income rose to 236 million reais ($133.5
million) from 181.7 million reais a year earlier, Vivo said in a
regulatory filing today. Sales increased 9.9 percent to 4.4
billion reais. Telefonica agreed to buy Portugal Telecom’s stake
in Vivo, Brazil’s largest wireless company, after raising its
bid for a third time to 7.5 billion euros ($9.7 billion).  
 Vivo’s preferred, or non-voting, shares rallied 4 percent,
its biggest gain since June 10, to 48.15 reais. The company’s
common shares jumped 11 percent to 108 reais.  
 The sale of the stake and integration with Telefonica’s
Brazilian fixed-line phone service would lead to cost savings
and “opportunities in terms of revenue” for Vivo,  Beatriz Battelli , an analyst at Brascan Corretora in Rio de Janeiro,
wrote in a July 23 report. Battelli has an “outperform”
recommendation on the stock.  
 Vivo, based in Sao Paulo, increased its clients by 20
percent from a year earlier, ending the quarter with 56 million.
The company’s share of the Brazilian mobile-phone market rose to
30 percent in June from 29 percent a year earlier, according to
Anatel, the country’s telecommunications regulator.  
 “Vivo continued to present a strong rate of sales in the
second quarter,”  Jacqueline Lison , an analyst at Banco Fator SA
who has a “buy”  recommendation  on the stock, wrote in a July
26 report. The increase was “driven mainly by the expansion of
the base, better mix and growth of data services.”
