             Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe’s
largest oil company, says it’s carrying out maintenance at its
Geelong refinery in Australia, declining to provide details of
what units are being serviced.  
 “The facility is still functioning,”  Paul Zennaro ,
Melbourne-based spokesman for Shell, said by telephone today.
The bitumen unit, damaged in a May fire, remains offline and it
isn’t known when it will return to service, he said.  
 Geelong, one of two refineries operated by Shell in
Australia, has the capacity to process as many as 120,000
barrels of oil a day and supplies about 50 percent of Victoria
state’s fuel needs, according its  website . Bitumen is being
sourced for customers from the company’s Clyde plant in New
South Wales and “other sources,” Zennaro said.  
 The Geelong plant is one of seven refineries in Australia,
with others operated by BP Plc, Caltex Australia Ltd. and Exxon
Mobil Corp.
