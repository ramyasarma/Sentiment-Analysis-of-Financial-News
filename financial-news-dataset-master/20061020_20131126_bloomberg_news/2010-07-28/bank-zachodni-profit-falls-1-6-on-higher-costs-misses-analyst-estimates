             Bank Zachodni WBK SA , the Polish
lender being sold by Allied Irish Banks Plc, said second-quarter
profit fell 1.6 percent on higher costs and provisions.  
 Net income dropped to 250.1 million zloty ($81.2 million),
compared with 254.2 million zloty a year earlier, the Wroclaw-
based company said in a regulatory statement today. That missed
the 262.8 million-zloty  mean estimate  of nine  analysts  surveyed
by Bloomberg.  
 Provisions at Poland’s third-largest bank increased 19
percent to 146.4 million zloty, while total operating costs
advanced 7 percent in the period. This cut the effect of a 25
percent gain in net interest income.  
 Allied Irish has to reach an agreement this year to sell
its holding in the bank to help meet capital requirements set by
Irish banking regulators. Final bids for Zachodni are due in
mid-August, a person with knowledge of the situation, who
declined to be identified before the process is finished, said
on July 13.  
 Zachodni’s first-half net income increased to 483.6 million
zloty from 369.4 million a year earlier. The bank will comment
on its earnings at a press conference at 10 a.m. in Warsaw.
