             Mapletree Logistics Trust , an
industrial landlord partly owned by  Temasek Holdings Pte ,
expects to double the value of its assets to about S$6 billion
($4.4 billion) in five years, spurred by tailor-made warehouses.  
 “We want to be able to get ourselves to a size where it
makes us a leading player” serving logistics operators across
Asia, Chief Executive Officer  Richard Lai  said in an interview
in Singapore yesterday. “There’s a lot of growth potential and
opportunities out there.”  
 Properties developed for specific customers, so-called
built-to-suit projects, may make up as much as 40 percent of new
assets over the coming five years as purchases of warehouses
become more difficult, Lai said. The trust also intends to buy
new properties worth about S$300 million built by its parent
 Mapletree Investments Pte.  over the next two years, and may buy
listed entities that would provide a “quantum leap,” Lai said.  
 Mapletree Logistics, which sold shares to the public in
2005 with 15 properties in Singapore valued at S$420 million,
now has 86 properties in Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, China,
Malaysia, South Korea and Vietnam valued at S$3 billion.
Yesterday, the company said it bought three properties in Japan
for S$200 million, the sixth deal announced since December.  
 Acquisitions this year may total about S$1 billion, an
amount Mapletree Logistics chalked up yearly from 2006 to 2008,
said Lai, 40.  
 “It’s a number that we’ve been doing in the past,” said
Lai, who became CEO in May after serving as chief financial
officer. “We would like to see ourselves be able to do it again,
but it’s not a hard number that we need to hit.”  
 New Markets  
 The company also aims to expand into  new markets  such as
Thailand, Indonesia, the Middle East and India, Lai said.  
 Lai said the company is “chasing a number of deals” to
win its first built-to-suit project, which will likely be in
Singapore, China or Japan. This will help Mapletree Logistics
set a track record for future projects, he said. The properties
it builds to order typically have 10-year leases from the outset
and offer better yields than purchases of existing warehouses,
Lai said.  
 Mapletree Logistics reported last week that the total
amount distributable to unit holders in the second quarter rose
8 percent to S$30.9 million.  
 Mapletree’s business is closely linked to economic swings,
and any contagion from the European debt crisis may affect bank
funding for the company, Lai said.  
 “I don’t think at this juncture we’re looking at a double
dip but the risk is there, it’s still a possibility and with
each passing day we hope it gets more remote,” he said. “We’re
keeping our fingers crossed on that.”
