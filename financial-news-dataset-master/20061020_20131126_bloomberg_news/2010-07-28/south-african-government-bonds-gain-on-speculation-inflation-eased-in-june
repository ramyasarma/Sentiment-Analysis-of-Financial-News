             South African bonds rose before a
government report that is expected to show inflation eased for a
sixth consecutive month, which may give the central bank more
room to lower its benchmark interest rate this year.  
 The benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
added 2 cents to 124.22 rand, reducing the yield by 1 basis
point to 7.68 percent, as of 10:01 a.m. in Johannesburg.  
 The  consumer price index  eased to 4.5 percent in June on an
annual basis, from 4.6 percent the previous month, according to
the  median estimate  of 21 economists polled by Bloomberg.
Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa publishes the data at
11:30 a.m. local time.  
 “A continued moderation in CPI could fuel expectations
for a rate cut,”  Standard Bank Group Ltd.  analysts  Michael Keenan  and Nomvuyo Guma wrote in a research note today.  
 The Reserve Bank has reduced its key  rate  by 5.5 percentage
points since December 2008, leaving it unchanged at 6.5 percent
on July 22.  
 The rand weakened for the first time in seven trading days,
declining 0.3 percent to 7.3476 per dollar, from a close of
7.3258 yesterday. Against the euro, the rand lost 0.4 percent to
9.5454.  
 Money market investors pared bets that South Africa’s
central bank will lower its main rate when it next meets on
Sept. 9, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month
contracts for cash in three months  rose 1 basis point to 6.32
percent.
