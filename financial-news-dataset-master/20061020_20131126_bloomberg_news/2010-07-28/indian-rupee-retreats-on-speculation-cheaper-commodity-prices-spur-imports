             India’s rupee fell from near a one-
week high on speculation local companies stepped up imports to
take advantage of a decline in global commodity prices, boosting
demand for foreign exchange.  
 The currency weakened after gold slid 5.7 percent from the
June 21 record of $1,265.30 an ounce and crude oil slumped 10.3
percent from a 19-month high of $87.15 per barrel reached May 3.
India is the world’s biggest buyer of bullion and imports almost
three-quarters of the oil it uses. The rupee also retreated as
the Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index  lost 0.7 percent.  
 “The rupee has been pulled under by some commodity-related
dollar demand, particularly driven by gold imports,” said
 Sudarshan Bhatt , chief currency trader at state-owned
Corporation Bank. “The weak trend in stocks isn’t helping
either.”  
 The currency declined 0.2 percent to 46.765 per dollar as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It yesterday strengthened 0.8 percent, the most in
five weeks, and touched a one-week high of 46.64 as the central
bank raised its benchmark  reverse-repurchase rate  by half a
percentage point to 4.5 percent. All 20 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predicted a quarter-point increase.  
 Offshore forwards contracts indicated the rupee will trade
at 47.35 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
for a rate of 47.21 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or
sell assets at a set price and date and offshore contracts are
non-deliverable, meaning they are settled in dollars.  
 The  UBS Bloomberg  Constant Maturity Commodity Index of 26
raw materials fell 0.8 percent yesterday, retreating from the
highest level since May 4.
