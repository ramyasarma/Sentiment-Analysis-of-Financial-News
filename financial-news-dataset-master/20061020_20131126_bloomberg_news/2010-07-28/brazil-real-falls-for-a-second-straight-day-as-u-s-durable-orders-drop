             Brazil’s real fell for a second day
as a decline in U.S. durable goods orders sparked concern a
slowdown in the global economic recovery will weaken demand for
the South American nation’s exports.  
 The real declined 0.1 percent to 1.7690 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 1.7672 yesterday. The currency has
gained 6.3 percent in the past 12 months.  
 New orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods decreased 1
percent in June, the U.S. Census Bureau announced today. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 1 percent
increase.  
 “Durable goods orders are a factor, as they did come out
on the soft side,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an emerging-markets
economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in Miami. “But the current
climate in Brazil remains very supportive of a stronger real.”  
 The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index of 26
raw materials jumped as much as 1.1 percent, led by corn, wheat
and zinc. “Continued global commodity price strength will
remain a key pillar of long-term real support,” Vazquez said.  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 10.83 percent.
