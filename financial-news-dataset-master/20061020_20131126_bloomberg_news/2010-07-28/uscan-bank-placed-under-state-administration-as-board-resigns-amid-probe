             Italy’s Credito Cooperativo
Fiorentino SC, a Florence-based bank, was put under state
administration after its chairman and management board stepped
down amid a corruption investigation.  
 Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  signed a decree putting
the local lender under state control, according to an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. The Bank of Italy had asked the
government to take action after an inspection showed “serious
violations” at the bank.  
 Chairman Denis Verdini, one of three coordinators of Prime
Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s People of Liberty party, resigned
July 23 after coming under investigation for allegedly rigging
tenders for wind-power plants on the island of Sardinia. He has
denied wrongdoing.  
 The bank’s board stepped down on July 26.
