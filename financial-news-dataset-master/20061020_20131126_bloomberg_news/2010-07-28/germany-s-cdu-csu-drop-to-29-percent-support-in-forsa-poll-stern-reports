             Support for Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s Christian Democrats and their Christian Social Union
Bavarian sister party fell to 29 percent from 30 percent a week
earlier, Stern magazine said, citing a Forsa poll it
commissioned together with RTL television.  
 Support for the parties’ Free Democrat coalition ally rose
one percentage point to 5 percent, Stern said. The Social
Democrats and the Greens held at a combined 47 percent support,
enough to win an absolute majority in the Bundestag, the lower
house of parliament, Stern said. The Left Party held at 11
percent support.  
 Forsa interviewed 2,502 people July 19-23 and the margin of
error was 2.5 percentage points, Stern said.
