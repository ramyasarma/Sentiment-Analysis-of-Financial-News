             China, the world’s biggest polluter,
may impose a cap on the country’s coal production by 2015 and
enforce energy consumption targets to cut carbon emissions and
reduce reliance on fossil fuels.  
 “There must be a ceiling on coal output in the future, and
energy needs can be met with new and renewable energy,” Wu Yin,
a deputy director at the National Energy Administration, told
the official  China Energy News  weekly newspaper in an interview.
Wu didn’t specify any production targets.  
 China, the world’s biggest user and producer of coal, wants
15 percent of its energy mix to come from non-fossil fuel
sources by 2020 to help meet emissions targets. By 2015, coal
may meet 65 percent of the country’s energy needs compared with
70 percent currently, Wu said in the July 26 issue of the paper.  
 “China needs a cap on both its energy consumption and
carbon emissions to achieve sustainable development of its
economy,” Jiang Kejun, head of energy and market analysis at
the National Development and Reform Commission’s energy research
institute, said by telephone today.  
 The country will cut output of carbon dioxide per unit of
gross domestic product by between 40 percent and 45 percent by
2020 from 2005 levels, according to a statement by the State
Council, or cabinet, in November last year.  
 China may set targets for consumption of energy, including
coal, for certain industries and regions, Wu told the newspaper,
without giving details. About 80 percent of the country’s power
plants are fueled by coal.
