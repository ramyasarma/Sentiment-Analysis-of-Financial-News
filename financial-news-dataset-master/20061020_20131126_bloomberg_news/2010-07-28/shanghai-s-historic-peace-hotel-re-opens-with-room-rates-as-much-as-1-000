             Shanghai’s Peace Hotel, which once
accommodated  Charlie Chaplin  and other celebrities, opened to
guests today after three years of restoration, the managers said
in a statement.  
 Fairmont Peace Hotel will be managed by Chinese hotelier
 Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels (Group) Co.  and  Fairmont
Hotels & Resorts Inc. , which runs the Savoy hotel in London. Jin
Jiang, which operates more than 600 hotels in China, spent
HK$500 million ($64 million) to restore the building.  
 Some of the main features of the  hotel  have been kept,
including the lobby with an Octagon ceiling, the hoteliers said.
Rates start from 2,300 yuan ($340) and go as high as more than
7,000 yuan for a night, the hotel’s general manager, Kamal
Naamani said at a press conference.  
 The hotel has 270 rooms including the so-called Nine
Nations Suites.  
 The building, located on the Bund promenade overlooking the
Huangpu River, has six restaurants and lounges, including the
Jazz Bar patronized by former U.S. Presidents  Jimmy Carter  and
 Ronald Reagan .  
 The Indian, English, Chinese and American suites have been
preserved, while the French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese and
German rooms were redesigned.  
 The hotel was previously called the Cathay Hotel and was
built by British businessman Victor Sassoon, opening in 1929.
The art deco property reopened as the Peace Hotel in 1956.  
 Jin Jiang also has an agreement with  Swatch Group AG  to
develop the south wing of the old Peace Hotel, called  Swatch Art
Peace Hotel , part of which will serve as an arts center.
