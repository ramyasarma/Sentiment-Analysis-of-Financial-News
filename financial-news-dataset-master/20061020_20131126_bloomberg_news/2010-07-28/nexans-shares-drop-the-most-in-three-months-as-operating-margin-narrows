             Nexans SA , the world’s biggest maker
of cables and wires, fell the most in three months in Paris
trading after reporting narrowing first-half margins.  
 Nexans, based in the French capital, fell as much as 3.72
euros, or 6.6 percent, to 52.29 euros. The stock traded at 52.61
euros as of 10:09 a.m. local time. Price pressure in some high-
voltage cables and the European building market pushed
profitability to 4 percent of revenue, down from 5.3 percent a
year earlier, the company said today.  
 Nexans is closing plants in Brazil and Italy to slash costs
following a slump in construction that was accentuated by poor
weather in Europe at the start of the year. Power grid operators
delaying investments and “difficulties” in executing some
submarine contracts also hampered results, Nexans said.  
 Operating profit should rise in the second half, and widen
to about 4.5 percent of revenue for the full year as sales grow
and some one-time events aren’t repeated, Nexans said. It
predicted generating net income for the full year after posting
a narrower loss in the first half.  
 Nexans is open to acquisitions, notably in emerging
markets, Chief Financial Officer  Frederic Michelland  said on a
conference call today. Some cable makers have been weakened by
the crisis, but not to the point of being “desperate,” he
said.
