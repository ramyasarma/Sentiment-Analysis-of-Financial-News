             Ethiopia ’s government will sign a
peace deal with the United Western Somali Liberation Front, a
rebel organization that has been fighting for independence in
the ethnic Somali region in the east of the country.  
 The accord will be signed tomorrow in the capital, Addis
Ababa, the Communication Ministry said in an e-mailed statement
today.  
 The UWSLF is a rival of the Ogaden National Liberation
Front, which also operates in the Somali region. Both groups are
considered to be successors to the Western Somali Liberation
Front that fought for independence for the region and assisted
the army of neighboring  Somalia  in its ultimately unsuccessful
invasion of the Ogaden in 1977-88.  
 In 2006, the UWSLF kidnapped Irish Red Cross Worker Donal
O’Suilleabhain and an Ethiopian colleague Hadis Ahmed Samatar.
Both were later released unharmed.
