             Crude oil fell for a third day on
signs that a slowing recovery in the U.S. will curtail fuel
consumption in the world’s second-largest energy user.  
 The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute said
yesterday that inventories of crude oil, gasoline and distillate
fuels such as diesel grew last week. The Energy Department will
issue its report for the same period today. American consumer
confidence fell in July, shaken by mounting concern over jobs
and wages that threatens to constrain the economic recovery,
according to the Conference Board.  
 “It’s macroeconomic news and fears of a double-dip that
will drive sentiment,” said  Christophe Barret , an oil analyst
with Credit Agricole CIB in London. “The API numbers were not
very supportive, with an increase in crude stocks that was not
expected and small increases in gasoline and distillates, so now
we’re waiting for confirmation from the Energy Department.”  
 Crude for September delivery was at $77.27 a barrel, down
23 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 12:07 a.m. London time. The contract dropped as much
as 62 cents earlier, or 0.8 percent, to $76.88. Brent crude for
September settlement on the London-based ICE Futures Europe fell
17 cents to $75.97.  
 ‘Improving Risk Appetite’  
 “It’s a mix of the reporting season and macroeconomic
indicators that is driving the market,” said Thina Saltvedt, a
commodities analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Oslo. “Some companies
are reporting good second-quarter results, and that’s improving
risk appetite. The oil market is still improving, but it’s going
slowly.”  
 The U.S. Energy Department report at 10:30 a.m. in
Washington may show oil inventories declined to a four-month
low, falling 1.73 million barrels from 353.5 million, based on
the median estimate from 16 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Gasoline and distillate supplies are expected to have
increased, the survey showed.  
 U.S. crude inventories rose to 356.3 million barrels in the
week ended July 23, the highest in four weeks, according to the
American Petroleum Institute report. Crude remains in a rising
channel on technical charts and will continue to face resistance
near $80 a barrel, according to  Societe Generale SA .  
 Oil for September delivery in New York will be capped at
the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the contract’s drop in
May, said  Stephanie Aymes , a cross-commodity technical analyst
at France’s second-largest bank by market value. This is in a
band near $80.82 a barrel, where a rally from below $70 stalled
on June 21.
