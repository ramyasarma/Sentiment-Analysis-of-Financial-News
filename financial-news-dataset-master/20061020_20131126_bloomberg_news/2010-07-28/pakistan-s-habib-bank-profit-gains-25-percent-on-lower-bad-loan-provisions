             Habib Bank Ltd. , Pakistan’s second-
biggest by assets, said second-quarter profit rose 25 percent as
it set aside less funds for delinquencies on loans.  
 Net income on a consolidated basis climbed to 4.05 billion
rupees ($47.3 million), or 4.03 rupees a share, from 3.25
billion rupees, or 3.19 rupees, a year earlier, the Karachi-
based bank said in a statement to the  stock exchange  today.
Revenue gained to 23.5 billion rupees 21.7 billion rupees a year
ago.  
 “There is a significant decline in provisioning,” said
 Hifza Zia , an analyst at Karachi-based Elixir Securities Ltd.
“The easing of rules by the central bank helped the lender
reduce the burden.”  
 The central bank began requiring lenders to set aside more
funds to cover delinquent borrowers in October 2007, and then
eased rules in January 2009, allowing banks to use 30 percent of
the value of assets provided as collateral to meet requirements
for provisions against defaults.  
 Habib Bank’s provisions and write-offs fell to 1.77 billion
rupees in the second quarter, from 2.74 billion rupees a year
ago, according to the statement.  
 Shares of Habib Bank fell 0.7 percent to 106.01 rupees at
3:11 p.m. local time on the Karachi Stock Exchange today. The
stock has  fallen  5.5 percent this year.
