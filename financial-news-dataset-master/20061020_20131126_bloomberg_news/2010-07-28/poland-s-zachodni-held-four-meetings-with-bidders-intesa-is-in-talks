             Bank Zachodni WBK SA , the Polish
lender being sold by Allied Irish Banks Plc, has held four
meetings with potential investors, Chief Executive  Mateusz Morawiecki  said today at a press conference in Warsaw.  
 “All potential investors guarantee development of our
bank,” Morawiecki said, declining to specify whether the
meetings were with four different investors. Zachodni has no
information about the “stage reached in the bank’s sale
process,” the Warsaw-based bank’s chief said.  
 AIB is selling its entire 70 percent stake in Poland’s
third biggest bank by market value to help meet capital
requirements set by Irish banking regulators. France’s  BNP
Paribas  SA and  PKO Bank Polski SA , Poland’s largest lender, are
in talks to buy the stake, a person with knowledge of the talks
said on July 13.  
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA , Italy’s second-biggest lender, is
conducting due diligence of Zachodni, spokeswoman  Francesca Palermo Patera  said today by telephone from Milan. Spain’s Banco
Santander SA is also among bidders for Zachodni, Puls Biznesu
reported on July 19, citing unidentified people close to the
transaction.
