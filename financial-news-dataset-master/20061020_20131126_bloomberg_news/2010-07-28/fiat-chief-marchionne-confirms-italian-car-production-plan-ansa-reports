             Fiat SpA Chief Executive Officer
Sergio Marchionne confirmed during a meeting with unions and the
government in Turin the carmaker’s plan to invest 20 billion
euros in Italian production, Ansa reported, without saying how
it obtained the information.  
 Fiat’s decision to move production of a family car in
Serbia won’t cut production at the manufacturer’s main plant in
Turin, Marchionne was cited as saying.
