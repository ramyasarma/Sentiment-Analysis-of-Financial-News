             Former Enron Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Jeffrey Skilling should be released from prison on bail
while a court reconsiders convictions questioned by the U.S.
Supreme Court, his lawyer said, according to a copy of a bail
request filed today at the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
The filing couldn’t be immediately confirmed in court records.
