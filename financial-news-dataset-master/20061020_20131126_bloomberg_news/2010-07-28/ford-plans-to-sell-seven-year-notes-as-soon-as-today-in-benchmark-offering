             Ford Motor Co. , last year’s biggest
issuer of high-yield corporate debt, plans to sell $1.25 billion
of seven-year notes a day after yields on similar-maturity
company debt fell to the lowest on record.  
 The second-largest U.S. automaker may offer the notes at a
yield of 6.9 percent through its Ford Motor Credit Co. unit as
soon as today, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who declined to be identified because terms aren’t
set.  
 Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas, Citigroup Inc. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are managing the sale, Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford said in a prospectus filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that didn’t specify the size
or timing of the offering.  
 Ford’s $1.5 billion of 8 percent notes due in 2016 fell
0.125 cent to 107.25 cents on the dollar to yield 6.59 percent,
or 4.85 percentage points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
as of 1:50 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  
 The bonds yesterday traded at 107.375 cents on the dollar
to yield 6.56 percent, the lowest since they were issued in
2006, according to Trace data. Yields have fallen from about 28
percent in October 2008.  
 Moody’s Investors Service  rates  Ford Motor Credit’s
unsecured debt Ba3 and Standard & Poor’s grades the company
three steps lower at B-.  
 Ford Motor Credit last tapped the corporate bond market in
April, when it sold $1.75 billion of five-year, 7 percent notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ford issued $4.6
billion of bonds last year, Bloomberg data show.  
 This week, Ford Motor Co. sold $1.39 billion of bonds
backed by auto loans, after boosting the offering from $1.08
billion, Bloomberg data show.  
 General Motors Co. is the biggest U.S. automaker. High-
yield, high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB-
by S&P.
