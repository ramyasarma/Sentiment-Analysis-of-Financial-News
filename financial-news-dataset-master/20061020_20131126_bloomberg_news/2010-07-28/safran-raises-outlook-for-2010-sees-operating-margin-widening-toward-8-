             Safran SA  raised its outlook for
2010 and predicted profitability will improve as air traffic and
demand for services rebounds.  
 Margins on recurring operating profit will widen toward the
8 percent  mark  from 6.7 percent in 2009, the Paris-based company
said. It stuck to a forecast for revenue similar to 2009 levels
and said that free cash flow will represent at least half the
recurring operating income.  
 Europe’s second-biggest maker of aircraft engines after
Rolls-Royce Group Plc is budgeting for a 5 percent increase in
global air traffic and stable sales of new aerospace equipment.
The 2010 outlook is also based on moderate growth in sales for
aerospace services, profitable growth for its security business,
and continued success in reducing overheads.  
 First-half  profit  rose 7.7 to 223 million euros ($290
million) with earnings per share rising to 56 cents.  
 “The balance of opportunities versus the challenges is
such that some upside is likely,” Chief Executive  Jean-Paul Herteman  said in a statement. “We are increasing the group’s
operating margins toward the 8 percent range and realizing
benefits from over two years of Safran Plus cost savings.”
