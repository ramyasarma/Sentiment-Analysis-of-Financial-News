             Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. , India’s
largest tractor maker, will roll out its cheapest model in more
parts of the country as farmers switch to machines from oxen.  
 Mahindra  may sell as many as 15,000 units of the 15-
horsepower tractor annually by March 2014, Bishwambhar Mishra,
head of the company’s Swaraj tractor unit, said in a phone
interview yesterday from Chandigarh, India. The 165,000-rupee
($3,500) model was unveiled in October in one state, where 1,000
units were sold through March.  
 Soaring food prices and rising incomes will enable farmers
with land holdings of less than 5 acres, who account for about
80 percent of the total, to buy small tractors as replacement
for oxen, Mishra said. Tata Motors Ltd. began selling the
world’s cheapest car for $2,500 last year, and the government
unveiled a $35 tablet computer last week as Indian developers
devise technology and machinery targeting first-time users.  
 “The opportunity is huge,” said  Umesh Karne , an analyst
at Brics Securities Ltd. in Mumbai, who rates Mahindra “buy.”  
 Per-capita incomes have almost doubled in the past five
years in India. The nation’s economy has grown an average 8.5
percent annually during the past five years and will probably
expand at a 9 percent annual pace by the year ending March 31,
2012, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said at the G-20 Summit in
Toronto last month.  
 ‘Crown Prince’  
 India has a low rate of farm mechanization, with 13
tractors for every 1,000 hectares, less than half the U.S. rate,
 ICRA Ltd.  said in May. Almost half the 439,600 tractors sold in
India in the year ended March were in the 31 horsepower to 40
horsepower range, it said, putting them beyond the reach of
small farmers.  
 As sales increase, profit from the cheaper model will also
rise, said Mishra. “Once you ramp up the volume, it will add to
the profitability, because it’s a very investment-light model.”  
 Mahindra gained as much as 2.4 percent to 654.9 rupees and
changed hands at 652.75 rupees at 11:53 a.m. in Mumbai.  
 Mahindra  has outsourced production of the tractor, called
Yuvraj, Mishra said. The name means “crown prince” in Hindi.
The company first started selling the tractor in the western
state of Gujarat and will now leverage its nationwide network of
more than 1,500 sales outlets, Mishra said.  
 Many farmers still use oxen for plowing, Mishra said. Their
productivity can increase more than fivefold with a tractor, and
it costs about 60,000 rupees to buy a pair of oxen, he said.  
 Higher purchase prices set by the government for wheat and
rice are helping boost farmers’ incomes, Mishra said. India’s
food inflation rate has stayed above 10 percent for a 14th
straight month.
