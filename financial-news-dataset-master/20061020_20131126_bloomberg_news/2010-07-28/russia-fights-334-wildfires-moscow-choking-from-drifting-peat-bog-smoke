             Russian emergency crews are fighting
334 forest fires covering an area of 81,321 hectares (201,000
acres), as Moscow remains wrapped in smoke from burning peat
bogs east of the city.  
 Firefighters extinguished 367 blazes across the country in
the last 24 hours, including 47 on peat bogs drained for
agriculture in the Soviet era, the Emergency Situations Ministry
said on its  website  today. Of the bog fires, 43 occurred in the
Moscow region. Since the start of the fire season, 21,209 fires
have claimed 449,634 hectares of forest.  
 Moscow authorities asked motorists to avoid the city center
“in order not to aggravate the already difficult environmental
situation,” the transportation department said on its  website .
A “sharp burning smell” has pervaded the entire city, and
“particularly intense smog” has settled in the south,
southeast and east of the city, the department said.  
 A heat wave has set temperature records in many cities this
month and compounded a drought that led the government to
declare weather-related emergencies in 23 crop-producing
regions. Agriculture Minister Yelena Skrynnik said on July 23
that the drought had damaged 10.1 million hectares, or 32
percent of all land under cultivation.
