             Emaar Properties PJSC, the builder
of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai, was rated “overweight”
in new coverage at Morgan Stanley, citing “cheap” valuation.  
 “Emaar offers strong recurring revenue through malls and
hotels in Dubai, and exposure to non-U.A.E. property markets,”
Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients today.  
 Morgan Stanley has a share-price estimate for Emaar of 4.3
dirhams. The shares gained 0.9 percent to 3.24 dirhams at 10:14
a.m. in Dubai.
