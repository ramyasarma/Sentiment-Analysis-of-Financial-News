             South Korea’s central bank bought
about $150 million in the foreign-exchange market in the first
hour of local trading today, helping end a six-day rally in the
won, according to two traders who asked not to be identified.  
 The won declined 0.5 percent to 1,187.45 per dollar as of
9:44 a.m. in Seoul, after yesterday touching a five-week high of
1,181.33. The Bank of Korea bought U.S. dollars after releasing
data today that showed the nation’s current-account surplus
reached a one-year high of $5.04 billion in June, the traders
said.
