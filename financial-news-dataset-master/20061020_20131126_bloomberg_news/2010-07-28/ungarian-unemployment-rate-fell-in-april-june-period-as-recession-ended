             Hungary’s jobless rate fell in the
April-June period, dropping for a second three-month period as
the country emerged from its worst recession in 18 years.  
 The rate dropped to 11.1 percent from 11.4 percent in the
three months through May and 11.8 percent in January-March,
which matched the highest level since the current method of
tallying was introduced in 1998,  the statistics office  in
Budapest said today in an e-mail. The median estimate of five
economists in a Bloomberg survey was 11.2 percent.
