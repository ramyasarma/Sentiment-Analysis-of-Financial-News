             Temasek Holdings Pte , Singapore’s
state-owned investment company, said it formed a joint venture
with Impulsora Mexicana de Desarrollos Inmobiliarios to invest
in land and real estate in Mexico.  
 The partners will invest a total of $200 million in the
venture, which will formally start this quarter, according to an
e-mailed statement from Temasek.  
 Temasek opened offices in Mexico City and Sao Paulo two
years ago to invest in Latin America. The venture with Impulsora
Mexicana de Desarrollos Inmobiliarios, a developer of raw land
based in the state of Queretaro, will seek opportunities to buy
land that can be used for planned housing as Mexico’s middle-
income population grows, Temasek said.  
 “Mexico’s transforming economy provides opportunities for
Temasek to expand its investments in sectors such as real
estate,”  Lorenzo Gonzalez Bosco , Temasek’s managing director of
investments in Mexico, said in the statement. “The rising
middle-income population also provides a foundation for Mexico’s
long-term growth.”
