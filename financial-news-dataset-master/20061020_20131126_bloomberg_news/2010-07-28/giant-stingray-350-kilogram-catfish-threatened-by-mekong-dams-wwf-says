             Dams and infrastructure development
along Asia’s  Mekong River  threaten the survival of some of the 
world’s largest freshwater fish species, including the giant 
freshwater stingray and the Mekong giant catfish, WWF said.  
 Hydropower dams block migration routes to spawning grounds
in the Mekong, home to four of the world’s 10 largest freshwater
fish species, according to a  report  published today by WWF,
formerly the World Wildlife fund.  
 Populations of Mekong giant catfish, which can weigh as
much as 350 kilograms (772 pounds) and are the world’s  third-
largest freshwater  fish, have declined 90 percent in two decades,
the report said. The river is also home to the largest
freshwater species, the giant freshwater stingray, which can
grow up to 600 kilograms.  
 China has completed four dams on the upper reaches of the
4,425-kilometer (2,750-mile) Mekong, the world’s 11th-longest
river, and four more are planned before 2025 to provide a total
capacity of 15,200 megawatts, enough to provide electricity for
75 million people. China’s first upstream dam became operational
in 1993, with subsequent openings in 2003 and 2008.  
 Another 11 mainstream dams are in various stages of
development in Laos, Thailand and Cambodia, in addition to
smaller dams on the Mekong’s tributaries. More than 60 million
people live in the Mekong’s lower basin, an area larger than the
U.S. state of Texas.  
 Mainstream dams constitute “the single largest threat” to
the Mekong’s wetlands, home to the world’s largest inland
fishery, the  Mekong River Commission  said in an April 2  report .  
 Dry weather reduced Mekong water levels to their lowest in
three decades earlier this year, raising  scrutiny  about
management of the river as governments aim to harness its
potential to provide food and generate electricity.
