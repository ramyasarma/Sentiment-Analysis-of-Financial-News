             Former Mexican President  Vicente Fox 
said an Arizona law to stem illegal immigration is
“xenophobic” and unfairly attacks immigrants contributing to
the state’s economy.  
 “I think xenophobic measures taken by Arizona and its
government are totally wrong,” Fox said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness.”  
 “We are partners,” Fox said in the interview from 
his ranch in Mexico. “Maybe that lady which is governor 
doesn’t know how many products from Arizona are being 
exported into Mexico.”  
 The Arizona statute makes it a state crime to be in the
U.S. illegally. It requires local police officers who come in
contact with someone for a law enforcement reason to check the
individual’s immigration status if they suspect the person lacks
proper documentation.  
 A U.S. district judge in Phoenix today barred Arizona from
enforcing that provision and other parts of the law.  
 Arizona Governor  Jan Brewer  has said current U.S. policies
have resulted in the state being “under attack” from Mexican
drug and immigrant-smuggling cartels.  
 In April, Mexico’s Congress urged President  Felipe Calderon 
to consider breaking commercial ties with Arizona. Mexico City
Mayor  Marcelo Ebrard  said his government will challenge the law
in U.S. courts.  
 Fox said that U.S. drug consumption is “absolutely
responsible” for more than 24,000 murders in Mexico since
Calderon took office in 2006. He added that Mexico shares
responsibility for border violence.  
 “What is happening is that this huge market of the United
States in drug consumption -- the largest in the world -- is
generating the weapons that are sold to cartels, is generating
the money that is laundered in the United States,” he said.
