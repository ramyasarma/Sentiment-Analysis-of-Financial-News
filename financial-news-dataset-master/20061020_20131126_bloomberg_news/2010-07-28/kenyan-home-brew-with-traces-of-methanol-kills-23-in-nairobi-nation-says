             As many as 23 people died in Kenya
after consuming an illicit homemade brew that was probably mixed
with methanol, the  Daily Nation  said.  
 Kenyan police arrested 24 people in possession of the cheap
alcohol, known locally as chang’aa, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said, citing the city’s police chief, Anthony Kibuchi. Most of
those who died lived in the Kibera slum in Nairobi, it said.
