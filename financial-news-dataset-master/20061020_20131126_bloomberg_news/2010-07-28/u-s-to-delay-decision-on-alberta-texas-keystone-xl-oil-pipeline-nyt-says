             The U.S. State Department will delay
a decision to permit a $7 billion pipeline from oil sands in
Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, the  New
York Times  reported.  
 The department will wait to complete a full environmental
impact assessment on the Keystone XL project and then allow
another 90 days for consultation between other government
agencies, the newspaper said today, citing the State Department.  
 No decision on the permit will be taken until the end of
the year at the earliest, it said. The State Department didn’t
say when the environmental assessment will be completed, the
newspaper reported.
