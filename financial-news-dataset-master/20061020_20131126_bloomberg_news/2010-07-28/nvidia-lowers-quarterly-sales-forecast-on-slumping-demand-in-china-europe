             Nvidia Corp ., the second-largest
maker of graphics chips, lowered its second-quarter sales
forecast because of slumping demand in Europe and China.  
 Revenue for the three months ending August 1, will be $800
million to $820 million, Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia
said. That compares with a prediction of $950 million to $970
million given May 13. Analysts had  projected  sales of $944.7
million, according to the average from a Bloomberg survey.  
 The company also suffered from rising component costs and
weaker demand for the plug-in graphics cards used to make video
games seem more realistic. Consumers also opted for lower-priced
cards, Nvidia said.  
 Nvidia fell 6.4 percent to $9.48 in extended trading after
the announcement. They had slipped 33 cents to $10.13 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading.  
 Nvidia is the largest maker of chips used in graphics cards
in computers, a market where it vies with Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. Intel Corp., the world’s largest graphics-chip maker,
doesn’t compete directly with Nvidia because its chips aren’t
used in graphics cards.
