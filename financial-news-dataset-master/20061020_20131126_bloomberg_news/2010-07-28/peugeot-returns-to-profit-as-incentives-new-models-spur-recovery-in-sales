             PSA Peugeot Citroen , Europe’s
second-largest carmaker, said its auto unit may lose money in
the second half as demand in the main European market slumps.  
 The manufacturing arm will be “close to breakeven” in the
latter half of 2010 after earning 525 million euros ($683
million) in the first six months, Chief Executive Officer
 Philippe Varin  said. The shares fell as much as 5.9 percent.  
 Peugeot predicts a second-half contraction of the European
market, which accounts for almost two-thirds of its sales
volume, as government scrapping incentives run out. The European
market will shrink 7 percent for the full year, the carmaker
said today. European sales grew 0.6 percent in the first six
months, according to the Brussels-based European Automobile
Manufacturers’ Association.  
 “In the second half you’ve got nascent pricing risk coming
in,” said  David Arnold , a London-based analyst at Credit
Suisse, which has an “underperform” rating on Peugeot shares.
“Consensus is going to have to take down estimates for the full
year.”  
 Peugeot dropped as much as 1.47 euros to 23.41 euros and
was down 4.1 percent to 23.87 euros as of 3:58 p.m. in Paris
trading. The  shares  are down 0.9 percent this year, valuing the
carmaker at 5.6 billion euros.  
 The carmaker said demand for the new Citroen C3 subcompact
and  Peugeot  3008 and 5008 minivans helped boost first-half
revenue 21 percent to 28.39 billion euros. Peugeot posted net
income of 680 million euros compared with a loss of 962 million
euros a year earlier.  
 One-Time Gains  
 The auto unit’s jump in  operating profit , which contributed
to the rise in net income, came largely from gains aside from
the increased car sales, Credit Suisse’s Arnold said.  
 Auto earnings, excluding increases from lower raw-material
costs, currency effects and capitalization of research and
development, amounted to 250 million euros, missing expectations
ranging from 300 million euros to 600 million euros, Arnold
said.  
 CEO Varin has pledged to expand in emerging  markets  to
reduce dependence on Europe. Helped by a second Chinese joint
venture announced this month, the carmaker said today it aims to
generate half of its unit sales outside Europe by 2015. Peugeot
expects European market growth of “a few percent” in 2011,
Varin said in an interview.  
 The company is “starting to see the benefits” of recent
cuts at two French plants and is counting on new models to have
factories running near capacity by 2012, compared with 89
percent today,  Varin  said. Peugeot’s European market share
gained 0.8 percentage points in the first half to 13.7 percent.
There is “no need” for further plant cutbacks, he said.  
 Chinese Growth  
 Peugeot  forecast 1.5 billion euros in earnings before
interest and taxes for 2010, compared with last year’s 689
million-euro loss. The carmaker also predicted an expansion
close to 9 percent in Latin America’s auto market and “double-
digit growth” in China this year.  
 It may take the French carmaker a total of 15 years to claw
back the share of Chinese registrations it commanded in 2000,
Varin said in the interview. He predicted an 8 percent market
share in 2015 after Peugeot adds a joint venture with China
Changan Automobile Group Co. to production it already shares
with  Dongfeng Motor Group Co.   
 The Dongfeng venture will increase its market share to 5
percent by 2015 from 3.4 percent today, while Peugeot-Changan
will aim for 3 percent of the market, Varin said.
