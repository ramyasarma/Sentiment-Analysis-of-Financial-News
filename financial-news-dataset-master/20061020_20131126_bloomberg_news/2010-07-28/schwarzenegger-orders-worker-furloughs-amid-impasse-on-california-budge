             California  Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  ordered more than 150,000 state workers to take
three days of mandatory unpaid time off to conserve cash.  
 The executive order, effective Aug. 1, stipulates that the
furloughs will end when a budget for the fiscal year that began
July 1 is enacted, the governor’s press secretary,  Aaron McLear, 
said in an e-mail. It comes after government workers endured
furloughs over almost 12 months that ended June 30.  
 California began its fiscal year without a spending plan
after Schwarzenegger and Democrats remained deadlocked over how
to fill a $19.1 billion deficit. Controller  John Chiang  has
warned he may again need to issue IOUs to pay bills if the
impasse continues into September.  
 “Every day of delay brings California closer to a fiscal
meltdown,” Schwarzenegger said in a statement today. “Our cash
situation leaves me no choice but to once again furlough state
workers until the Legislature produces a budget I can sign.”  
 About 37,000 state workers, including highway patrol
officers, forest firefighters and psychiatric technicians, are
exempt from the furloughs because their unions struck labor
contracts with Schwarzenegger that included cuts in pensions he
sought.
