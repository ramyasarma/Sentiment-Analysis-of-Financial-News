             Consolidated Minerals Ltd. , owned by
Ukrainian billionaire  Gennadiy Bogolyubov , wants to raise annual
manganese production by 25 percent to meet rising global demand
from steelmakers.  
 “We’re ramping up production at Woodie Woodie just as
global demand for manganese is picking up,” Chief Executive
Officer Glenn Baldwin said in an interview at the mine site
yesterday. Mine output was 603,000 metric tons in the first half,
putting it on track to produce 1.2 million tons this year for
the first time, he said.  
 Bogolyubov’s Palmary Enterprises Ltd. acquired Consolidated
in January 2008 for A$1.3 billion ($1.2 billion) after a bidding
war. Demand for manganese, used to harden steel, recovered in
the second quarter, according to  BHP Billiton Ltd. , which sees
China’s steel demand doubling by 2020 from 2008 levels.  
 The Perth-based company is spending A$40 million on
exploration at the mine, in Western Australia’s Pilbara district,
this year. Production was 818,000 tons in 2008 and 961,000 tons
last year, Baldwin said.  
 Baldwin said “discussions are ongoing” with  OM Holdings
Ltd.  regarding a stake purchase in Woodie Woodie.  
 OM Talks  
 OM, a Singapore-based manganese producer, said April 19 it
was in talks to buy a stake. OM was considering whether there
are “strategic, operating and, or, marketing synergies,” from
owning part of Woodie Woodie. Consolidated has an 11.5 percent
stake in OM through its Stratford Sun Ltd. unit, according to
April data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 A purchase would make OM the world’s second-largest
producer of low phosphorous siliceous, high-grade manganese ore,
OM said. OM produces manganese from the  Bootu Creek mine  in
Australia’s Northern Territory.  
 “There is no set timetable to make a decision,” Baldwin
said. He declined to comment on whether Consolidated would be
willing to make a takeover offer for OM.  
 OM on July 23 raised its full-year manganese production
target at Bootu Creek to 850,000 tons after reporting June
quarter output of 195,756 tons, according to a regulatory filing.  
 Consolidated’s 5,600 square kilometer (2,162 square mile)
tenement at Woodie Woodie had reserves of 12.4 million tons as
of Dec. 31, which Baldwin said will be “substantially added
to” this year. The company is the largest independent supplier
of manganese and claims the mine has the world’s highest quality
of the stainless steel-hardening material.  
 Chinese Demand  
 Demand for manganese is improving, led by China, since
slumping at the start of the year, Baldwin said. Consolidated is
not considering a relisting and is “keeping tabs” on potential
takeover targets, he said.  
 BHP , the world’s largest shipper of manganese, produced
1.73 million tons of the ore in the three months to June 30,
more than double the output in the same period the year before,
according to company documents.  
 Consolidated plans to restart its Coobina chromite mine,
also in Western Australia, in October at a cost of A$6 million,
Baldwin said. It’s targeting annual output of 350,000 tons to
400,000 tons a year. Its Beta Hunt nickel mine will remain on
care and maintenance, he said.
