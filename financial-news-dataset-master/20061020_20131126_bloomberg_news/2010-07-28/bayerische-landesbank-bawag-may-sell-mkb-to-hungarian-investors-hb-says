             Bayerische Landesbank  and Bawag PSK
Bank may sell MKB to a group of Hungarian investors,
Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified bankers in Budapest
and Vienna.  
 The EU Commission is urging BayernLB to sell its 90 percent
stake after the German bank received 10 billion euros ($13
billion) of state aid, the newspaper said. The sale is being
modeled on WestLB’s divestment of its Hungarian unit last year,
according to Handelsblatt.
