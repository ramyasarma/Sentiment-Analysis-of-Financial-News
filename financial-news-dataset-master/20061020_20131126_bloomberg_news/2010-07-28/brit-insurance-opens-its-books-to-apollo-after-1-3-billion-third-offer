             Brit Insurance Holdings NV , the U.K.
insurer that sponsors the England cricket team, granted  Apollo
Global Management  permission to review its books after the
private equity firm increased its offer for the company.  
 Apollo is prepared to pay about 851 million pounds
($1.3 billion), or 10.75 pounds a share, in cash for Brit, the
Amsterdam-based insurer said today in a statement. The bid,
Apollo’s third, is 47 percent higher than Brit’s closing share
price on June 10, the day before the first takeover offer was
announced. The insurer rejected a bid of 10.50 pounds a share
on July 2.  
 Apollo’s proposal “is a good basis on which we can start
discussions,” Chief Executive Officer  Dane Douetil  said in a
telephone interview. “All we’ve agreed to do is open the books
to help them come to a conclusion about what final offer they’re
going to make.”  
 Apollo first bid for Brit in June after the insurer’s share
price fell 4 percent in the previous 12 months, compared with a
12 percent rise in the  FTSE ASX Nonlife Insurance Index . Brit
has had higher claims from financial firms protecting themselves
against lawsuits in the past year and expects to pay out about
$71 million for the Chilean earthquake in February.  
 “The tone of management points to an increasing level of
acceptance for this takeover,” said  Christian Stobbs , a London-
based analyst at KBC Peel Hunt Ltd. with a “buy” rating on the
stock. The 10.75 pounds a share Apollo is prepared to pay for
Brit is “fair value,” he said.  
 Shares Gain  
 The stock climbed 90.5 pence, or 9.9 percent, to 1,004
pence at 11:55 a.m. in London trading, valuing the firm at about
796 million pounds.  
 Private equity executives are resuming purchases after the
credit crisis halted dealmaking. The firms have announced $75.4
billion of takeovers this year, more than double the same period
in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Apollo’s due diligence will take “a number of weeks,”
Douetil said, declining to give a specific timeframe.  
 Brit posted first-half net income of 67.4 million pounds,
compared with a loss of 6.3 million pounds a year ago, the
insurer said today in a separate statement. That beat the 39
million-pound estimate of eight analysts surveyed by the
insurer.  
 Brit had a 20.3 million-pound gain as the U.S. dollar
climbed against the British pound in the period. The insurer
also unlocked 41.9 million pounds of reserves that backed
potential claims in previous years in the first half, compared
with 19 million pounds a year ago.
