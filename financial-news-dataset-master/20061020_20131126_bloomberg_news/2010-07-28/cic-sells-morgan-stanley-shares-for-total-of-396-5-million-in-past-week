             China Investment Corp. , the Chinese
sovereign wealth fund that bought a 9.9 percent stake in Morgan
Stanley in 2007, sold $132.8 million of shares in the investment
bank yesterday, bringing the total amount sold in the last week
to $396.5 million.  
 CIC sold 4.88 million shares at a weighted average of
$27.25 yesterday, the Beijing-based fund said in a regulatory
filing. CIC still owns 161.6 million Morgan Stanley shares,
according to the filing.  
 The fund sold 14.6 million shares since July 21, the day
Morgan Stanley jumped by the most in more than a year after
reporting better-than-expected earnings. The shares, which are
down 8.8 percent this year, have climbed more than 18 percent
since July 2, when the stock hit a one-year low.  
 CIC bought its stake in Morgan Stanley for $5 billion in
2007, when the New York-based firm reported its first quarterly
loss as a public company. CIC received premium equity units,
which are convertible to common stock next month. Morgan Stanley
said in a July 21 filing that it won’t remarket the trust
preferred securities associated with the investment.  
 CIC bought an additional $1.2 billion of shares in Morgan
Stanley’s equity offering in June 2009. The U.S. bank was CIC’s
second-largest holding, according to a February filing. Earlier
this month, the fund named Morgan Stanley Chairman  John Mack  to
its International Advisory Council.  
 The shares advanced 6 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $27.01 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
