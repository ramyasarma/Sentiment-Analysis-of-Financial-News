             Crude oil reversed losses in New
York as gains in Chinese equity markets added to signs that fuel
demand will increase in the world’s largest energy user.  
 Oil climbed after China’s Shanghai’s Composite Index rose
1.2 percent as a jump in industrial profits and the prospects
for increased spending and tourism boosted the domestic economic
outlook. An U.S. Energy Department report today may show oil
inventories dropped to a four-month low, falling 1.73 million
barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Crude for September delivery was at $77.63 a barrel, up 12
cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 3:04 p.m. Singapore time. The contract earlier dropped as
much as 62 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $76.88.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, surged 58.30, or 2.3 percent, to
2,633.66 at the 3 p.m. close, the highest since May 28.  
 Stocks in Japan, the world’s third-largest oil consumer,
rose, sending the Topix index to its biggest gain in almost
three weeks.  
 Commercially held U.S. crude stockpiles probably fell 1.73
million barrels from 353.5 million, based on the median estimate
from 16 analysts. Gasoline and distillate supplies are expected
to have increased.  
 Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe were at $76.29, up 16 cents, at 3:09 p.m.
Singapore time. The contract earlier fell as much as 44 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $75.69 a barrel. Yesterday, it declined $1.37,
or 1.8 percent, to settle at $76.13.  
 U.S. crude inventories rose to 356.3 million barrels in the
week ended July 23, the highest in four weeks, according to the
American Petroleum Institute report.  
 Gasoline stockpiles climbed 877,000 barrels to 222.3
million, a four-month high. Distillate fuel supplies, including
heating oil and diesel gained for the ninth time in 10 weeks,
adding 407,000 barrels to 162.3 million, the report showed.
That’s the highest since the week to Jan. 15.
