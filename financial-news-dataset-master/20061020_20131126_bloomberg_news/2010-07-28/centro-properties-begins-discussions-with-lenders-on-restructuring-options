             Centro Properties Group , the
Australian shopping center owner that ceded control to banks
after failing to refinance debt in December 2008, said it will
extend and refinance $2.7 billion of loans in its U.S. business.  
 Centro has received an extension until December 2011 on
$2.3 billion of debt and will refinance a further $400 million
within Super LLC, a joint venture of Centro,  Centro Retail Trust 
and Centro MCS 40, the company said in a statement to the
Australian stock exchange. It will also repay $25 million of a
bridge term loan as part of the extension, it said.  
 The  shares  closed up 5 percent at 21 Australian cents at
the 4 p.m. close in Sydney, after earlier surging as much as 20
percent and climbing 18 percent yesterday.  
 “We have made good progress and have commenced discussions
with our lenders on potential restructuring options we have
under consideration,” Chief Executive Officer  Robert Tsenin 
said in the statement. “Our assessment has confirmed that any
restructure will be complex, with numerous structural, financing
and stakeholder considerations to manage.”  
 Former Centro CEO  Andrew Scott  borrowed to buy $9 billion
of malls during 2006 and 2007, then spun off the centers into
funds which Centro managed for a fee. That backfired when debt
costs spiked and asset values slumped in the financial crisis,
with banks agreeing in December 2008 to work with the then owner
of 650 U.S. malls to avoid liquidation.  
 The restructure could take until the end of 2011 to
implement, Centro said in today’s statement.  
 The company is looking for partners to help grow its
unlisted fund management business, the largest in Australia, it
said in the statement.
