             Catalonia’s parliament in Barcelona
voted to ban bullfighting today in the first such prohibition in
mainland Spain.  
 Regional lawmakers voted 68 to 55 for the ban, the speaker
of the assembly said. The bill was the result of a popular
initiative backed by 180,000 signatures, according to the  Prou 
platform behind the initial campaign.  
 “Toreros” have fought half-ton bulls to the death in
public arenas for centuries, inspiring writers including  Ernest Hemingway . Opposition to the tradition has been growing in
recent years, with a third of Spaniards favoring a bullfight
ban, rising to a majority among those aged 18 to 29, according
to a poll for  El Mundo  newspaper in 2007.  
 The number of bulls taken on in 2009 fell to 4,436 from
6,396 in 2003, according to data from the  Interior Ministry .
Catalans are less interested in bullfighting than many of their
compatriots as 106 bulls faced the matador’s sword in the region
last year, compared with more than 1,000 in Andalucia and almost
800 in Madrid.  
 The vote comes as Catalonia is battling Spanish
institutions over its identity and two weeks after tens of
thousands of people marched in Barcelona for the right to call
the autonomous region a “nation.”  
 Animal Protection  
 “The reality, and you know it, is that for some political
groups it’s not about animal protection,” Albert Rivera, of the
Mixed Group said in the parliamentary debate before the vote.
“You want to eliminate everything that reminds us that
Catalonia forms part of Spain.”  
 Supporters of the bill say it’s not part of Catalonia’s bid
for greater autonomy. Josep Rull, a regional lawmaker for
 Convergencia i Unio , said the law is about ending cruelty to
animals and would make Catalonia more European than the rest of
Spain. CiU allowed its lawmakers to decide individually how to
vote.  
 “As a nation we will take a step forward and that gives us
a certain pride,” he said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“A majority in Catalonia has values that are shared with the
rest of Europe.”  
 The Canary Islands banned bullfighting in 1991 as part of a
wider  law  that aimed to protect domestic animals, singling out a
ban on dog fights and the phasing out of cock fights.
