             Bundesbank Vice President  Franz- Christoph Zeitler  denied that Germany, which didn’t sign an
interim agreement over a new Basel accord, is isolated in the
discussions, Handelsblatt  reported , citing an interview.  
 The country’s arguments were shared by other nations and
the German delegation insisted on disclosing in the Basel
Committee press release published earlier this week that it
didn’t sign the preliminary accord, the newspaper cited Zeitler
as saying.  
 Germany didn’t agree because capital definitions can’t be
judged unless capital requirements are also defined, Zeitler
also told the newspaper. The new rules should allow that up to
half of the core capital may consist of forms other than stock
or profits, Handelsblatt added, citing the official.  
 Zeitler added that other members of the committee are
pressing that stock and profits should make up 80 percent to 90
percent of core capital, Handelsblatt reported.
