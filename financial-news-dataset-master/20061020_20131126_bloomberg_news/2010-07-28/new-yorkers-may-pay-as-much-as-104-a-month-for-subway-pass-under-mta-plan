             New York City subway and bus users
may pay $10 more for a limited monthly pass or an added $15 for
unlimited rides under the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority’s proposals to boost revenue.  
 The board of the MTA, whose 8.5 million weekday riders make
it the largest U.S. mass-transit system, voted to hold public
hearings in September on a menu of fare and toll proposals aimed
at raising revenue by 7.5 percent next year. The board also
approved cutting 200 station agents.  
 “This is not a situation that we’ve created, it’s not a
situation that’s occurring because our expenses are up,”  Jay H. Walder , the MTA’s chairman and chief executive officer, said at
the board’s meeting today in New York. “It’s a situation that’s
occurring because our subsidies have not been there.”  
 The MTA’s  $12 billion  budget has suffered from declines in
real estate taxes and state subsidies. Collections from a
payroll tax in the 12 counties served by the MTA are about $386
million less than initial estimates. The state has cut $143
million in MTA aid to help close its own $9.2 billion budget
gap.  
 The proposed fare increases come as the MTA has cut service
and trimmed its workforce to help close a budget deficit of more
than $900 million this year. The MTA raised fares for single
rides on buses and subways to $2.25 from $2 last year.  
 ‘More for Less’  
 “Riders are being asked to pay more for less given the
tens of millions of dollars of service cuts the MTA just put
into effect in late June,” said  Gene Russianoff , an attorney
with the Straphangers Campaign, an advocate for transit-system
users.  
 The new financial plan also includes raising fares on the
MTA’s Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road lines by as much as
9.4 percent and increasing some bridge tolls to $6 from $5.50.  
 The one-way toll for the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge between
Staten Island and Brooklyn would rise to $12 from $11.  
 One MTA proposal would cap unlimited monthly Metro Cards at
90 trips and raise the price to $99 from $89. Another would
maintain a monthly Metro Card with no limit, while raising the
price to $104 from $89. A seven-day Metro Card capped at 22
trips would rise to $28 from $27, while an unlimited weekly card
would go to $29 from $27.  
 Average Use  
 Monthly unlimited Metro Card users have a median household
income of $63,000 and average 59 trips, the MTA said. Weekly
transit-pass users have a median household income of $38,000.  
 A rider using the 90-trip maximum on a monthly Metro Card
costing $99 would pay $1.10 per ride, or $1.15 less than the
base fare. About 7 percent of riders take more than 90 rides a
month.  
 The toll and fare increases would raise an additional $413
million for the MTA next year. The transit agency also aims to
save about $500 million by cutting its workforce by 5 percent,
to 66,292, and freezing wages for two years unless employee
unions agree to change work rules or contributions to health
care. Wages and benefits account for two-thirds of the MTA’s
operating expenses.  
 John Samuelson, head of the Transport Workers Union,
criticized the MTA’s financial plan and said Walder should cut
his own compensation, which includes salary of $350,000 a year.  
 “Give yourself a pay cut,” Samuelson said. “Go after
your own pension. Go after your own medical benefits.”  
 New-Card Surcharge  
 The MTA is also proposing a $1 surcharge on new Metro
Cards to encourage riders to refill old ones, which will save an
estimated $13 million in printing and litter-removal costs.  
 The MTA, which has to close a $1.1 billion budget gap in
2011, agreed to raise revenue by 7.5 percent in 2011 and 2013 as
part of a state bailout package last year.  
 Debt service accounts for $2.1 billion of the MTA’s budget
and is expected to increase 24 percent to $2.6 billion in 2014.
The transit agency plans on selling $8.1 billion in bonds for
capital projects in the next four years.  
 The MTA must curb its borrowing and re-examine the transit
agency’s  $26.3 billion capital program  or face continued stress
on the operating budget, said board member  Doreen Frasca .  
 “Debt and the capital program are the seven-ton elephants
in the room that we don’t talk about,” said Frasca. “We throw
a blanket over it, we think we’ve covered it, but I think maybe
at best we put a string bikini on the elephant.”
