             Wide receiver  Terrell Owens  agreed
to join the Cincinnati Bengals, head coach  Marvin Lewis  was
cited as saying on the National Football League team’s website.  
 “Our team is excited and pleased across the board,” Lewis
said on the  website . “Terrell is a proven, productive player
who can come in and help us. It’s a big move for us, one that we
really think is going to help us.”  
 Contract terms weren’t disclosed. Telephone calls and e-
mails to Bengals spokesman  Jack Brennan  seeking details went
unanswered. Owens is expected at the Bengals’ training camp
tomorrow at Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky,
according to the team’s website.  
 Owens, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, agreed to a one-year
deal and will receive $2 million with the possibility of another
$2 million in bonuses, the Associated Press reported, citing two
people familiar with the matter it didn’t identify.  
 Owens, 36, has spent 14 seasons in the NFL with the San
Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo
Bills. During his career, he has 144 touchdown receptions.
