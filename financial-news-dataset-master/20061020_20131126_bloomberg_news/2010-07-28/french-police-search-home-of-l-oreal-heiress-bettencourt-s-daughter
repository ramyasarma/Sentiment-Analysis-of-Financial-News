             Police searched today the home of
 Francoise Bettencourt Meyers , the daughter of  L’Oreal SA  heiress
 Liliane Bettencourt , as part of an investigation into invasion
of privacy, prosecutors said.  
 The search took place today at the house in the Paris
suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s
office, who declined to be named, said by telephone. The search
was over by noon, said Bettencourt Meyers’s lawyer,  Olivier Metzner .  
 Nanterre prosecutor  Philippe Courroye  opened several
preliminary inquiries after secret recordings were made at
Bettencourt’s house, his office said. The recordings, on 28
compact discs, were made starting in May 2009 by a former butler
and given to Meyers.  
 “They did not find anything, because there wasn’t anything
to find,”  Metzner  said in a telephone interview after the
search.  
 Bettencourt Meyers, the only child of the heiress, filed a
private prosecution against photographer and author Francois-
Marie Banier last year, claiming he manipulated her mother, now
87, to obtain art, real estate and cash gifts. The mother has
opposed her daughter’s suit.
