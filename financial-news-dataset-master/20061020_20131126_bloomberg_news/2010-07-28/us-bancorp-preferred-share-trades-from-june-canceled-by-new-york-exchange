             About 40 trades in a series of
preferred shares issued by US Bancorp were canceled by the New
York Stock Exchange after it found investors got bad prices.  
 Transactions in US Bancorp’s Series A non-cumulative
preferred on June 16 through June 18 were nullified because they
were executed at levels that weren’t reasonably related to the
market value after an exchange offer, the NYSE Euronext unit
said in a statement on its  website .  
 The trades occurred at about $80 a share. The prices should
have been closer to $800 after the stock was created in a
conversion, NYSE said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. NYSE spokesman  Eric Ryan  declined to
comment beyond the website update.  
 The canceled executions were “based on incorrect or
grossly misinterpreted structural or issuance information that
resulted in severe price dislocation,” according to the SEC
filing. The preferred stock has been halted for more than a
month and is scheduled to reopen July 20.
