             New Zealand’s dollar dropped for a
third straight day as the central bank said deteriorating growth
prospects will slow the pace of interest-rate increases after it
raised the benchmark for a second month.  
 The currency weakened against all of its most-traded
counterparts after Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor  Alan Bollard  said in a statement that the “pace and extent” of
future boosts in borrowing costs would be more moderate than
projections he made in June.  
 Bollard’s “statement is more dovish than in June, and the
market largely expected it to be unchanged,” said  Imre Speizer ,
a market strategist in Wellington, New Zealand, at Westpac
Banking Corp., Australia’s second-largest lender. “The kiwi
dollar is being sold on that.”  
 New Zealand’s dollar dropped 0.7 percent to 72.22 U.S.
cents at 11:46 a.m. in New York, from 72.73 yesterday.
Australia’s currency rose 0.6 percent to 89.86 U.S. cents after
falling to 89.06 cents, the lowest level since July 23.  
 New Zealand’s central bank increased the official cash rate
by a quarter-percentage point to 3 percent, matching the
forecast of all of the 14 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 The kiwi has gained 5.5 percent against the dollar in the
past month as investors bet the central bank will keep raising
interest rates. Swaps traders expect the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand to raise its benchmark by 0.87 percentage point over the
next year, a Credit Suisse Group AG  index  shows.  
 ‘Softening’ Outlook  
 The currency’s recent gains are “inconsistent with the
softening in New Zealand’s economic outlook and moderation in
our export commodity prices,” Bollard said.  
 New Zealand posted a trade surplus of NZ$276 million ($199
million) in June, Statistics New Zealand said today, less than
the NZ$368 million forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Exports  fell
9.8 percent to NZ$3.78 billion from a record in May.  
 The RBNZ “did talk about higher growth for their trading
partners than what they had forecast, but they see risks to that
growth,” said  Alex Sinton , a senior dealer at ANZ National Bank
Ltd. in Auckland, New Zealand. Policy makers “are waiting for
further signs to make sure they progress in the right
direction,” he said.
