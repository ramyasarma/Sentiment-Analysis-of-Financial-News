             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index gained
for an eighth day, extending the longest winning streak this
year, as financial stocks rallied, overshadowing a plunge by the
nation’s biggest phone company.  
 Banco Bradesco SA  surged after reporting second-quarter net
income that beat forecasts, helping MSCI’s banking-stocks gauge
climb to a six-month high. Wireless carrier  Vivo Participacoes
SA  gained the most in seven weeks after Spain’s Telefonica SA
agreed to buy control.  Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA  fell 16
percent on concern earnings will be diluted by a 24 billion-real
($13.6 billion) share sale that’s part of a deal to sell a stake
in the company known as Oi.  
 The  Bovespa  stock index advanced 0.2 percent to 66,808.25,
the highest level since May 3, at the close of trading in Sao
Paulo at 4 p.m. New York time. Thirty stocks gained on the
measure while 34 fell. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap  index declined
0.2 percent. The real weakened 0.1 percent to 1.7681 per dollar.  
 “Earnings have been pleasing, here and abroad,” said
 Pedro Galdi , an equity analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW
Corretora. “Every day we’re seeing inflows of foreign money.
It’s a good sign.”  
 The Bovespa rose yesterday as investors speculated interest
rates will increase more slowly and bank lending expanded.  
 Bradesco  
 Bradesco advanced 4.5 percent, the most in three weeks, to
32.20 reais after saying adjusted net income, which excludes
one-time events, rose 23 percent to 2.46 billion reais. That
exceeds the average estimate of 2.26 billion reais in a
Bloomberg survey of four analysts. The MSCI Brazil/Financials
Index increased 3 percent to the highest level since Jan. 11.  
 Vivo , Brazil’s biggest wireless carrier, jumped 4 percent
to 48.15 reais after Telefonica agreed to buy Portugal Telecom
SGPS SA’s stake in the joint venture that controls the firm for
7.5 billion euros ($9.7 billion).  
 Portugal Telecom separately agreed to buy a stake in
 Telemar Norte Leste SA , paying a maximum 8.4 billion reais for
indirect and direct stakes equivalent to 22.4 percent of Oi, the
companies said today in regulatory filings. Telemar Norte
Leste’s parent company is Tele Norte Leste, which in turn is
controlled by closely-held Telemar Participacoes SA.  
 Tele Norte  plans to raise 12 billion reais by selling
common shares for 38.55 reais and preferred, or non-voting,
stock for 28.26 reais to existing shareholders, according to a
filing. Telemar will also offer existing shareholders 12 billion
reais in stock, selling common shares for 63.70 reais and
preferred for 50.70 reais each.  
 Dilute Earnings  
 The  stocks  are falling on concern the share sale will
dilute earnings per share for investors, said  Rosangela Ribeiro ,
a telecommunications stocks analyst at SLW Corretora.  
 “There’s dilution, and the market didn’t like it,”
Ribeiro said in a telephone interview. “This took people by
surprise.”  
 Investors also had expected a higher price for the
acquisition, said Galdi. “The shares had gained a lot on
speculation about the deal,” he said.  
 Tele Norte Leste voting shares, which had climbed 35
percent in the three months through yesterday, plummeted the
most since December 2006, losing 6.70 reais to 35.20 reais.
 Telemar , which gained 15 percent in the past three months,
slipped 8.6 percent to 48.01 reais, for the biggest drop since
December 2008. The declines helped the Bovespa fall as much as
0.4 percent in earlier trading.  
 Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar ,
Brazil’s biggest retailer, fell 5.5 percent to 60.35 reais after
saying net income in the second quarter fell to 62.3 million
reais because of a tax installment of 64.5 million reais.  
 The  Bovespa index  trades for 12.9 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 12.1 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 16
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 15.6 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
