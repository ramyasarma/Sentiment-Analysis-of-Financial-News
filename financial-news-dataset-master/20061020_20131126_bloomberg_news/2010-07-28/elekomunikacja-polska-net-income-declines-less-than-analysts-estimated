             Shares of  Telekomunikacja Polska SA 
rose to a two-month high after Poland’s largest phone company
said second-quarter profit fell by a less-than-estimated 13
percent.  
 Telekomunikacja  gained  as much as 3.9 percent to 15.85
zloty in Warsaw, the highest level since May 27, outstripping
the 0.6 percent gain in the benchmark WIG20 Index. The shares
traded up 2.6 percent as of 9:52 a.m.  
 The company “surprised on the positive” side “all across
the mobile segment,” posting “very strong” growth in the
number of subscribers from the first quarter, and “decent”
sales,  Pawel Puchalski , an analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK SA in
Warsaw, wrote in a note.  
 Net income fell to 325 million zloty ($105.5 million) from
374 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based unit of
 France Telecom SA  said in a statement today. That compares with
the 287.3 million-zloty mean estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
10 analysts.  
 Telekomunikacja’s revenue has been pushed down by
reductions in regulated prices. Sales fell 4.7 percent to 3.99
billion zloty, beating a mean estimate of 7.9 percent, and a 10
percent drop in the first quarter, thanks to better than
estimated mobile-phone performance.  
 The pace of the decline in sales will slow to less than 4
percent in the second half, the company said. Telekomunikacja
also increased its forecast for 2010  free cash flow  to at least
2.3 billion zloty from at least 2 billion zloty.  
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, will probably be 36 percent to 37
percent of sales in the second half, compared with 37 percent in
the second quarter, Telekomunikacja added.
