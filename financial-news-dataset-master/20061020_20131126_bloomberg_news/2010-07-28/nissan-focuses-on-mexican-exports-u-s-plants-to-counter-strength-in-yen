             Nissan Motor Co.  will boost output
capacity in Mexico to about 700,000 vehicles a year and may
consider increasing exports from the U.S. as the strong yen
makes North American production more competitive.  
 “Based on the currencies, there is a point in time where
the competitiveness of those exports is going to increase,”
 Carlos Tavares , executive vice president and head of Nissan’s
operations in the Americas, said in an interview yesterday in
San Jose, California. He didn’t say whether there was a specific
plan to increase shipments from U.S. factories.  
 Nissan, Japan’s third-largest carmaker, is spending $600
million to upgrade two Mexican auto plants and is increasing U.S.
production as a stronger yen make exports from Japan less
profitable. The yen has risen against all the world’s major
currencies in 2010 and is up about 5 percent against the U.S.
dollar and 14 percent against the  euro  this year.  
 Nissan, based in Yokohama, has declined 20 percent this
year in Tokyo trading. The stock rose 2.1 percent to 647 yen as
of 10:01 a.m.  
 The automaker has already moved some production overseas
from Japan, citing the nation’s rising currency. The company has
begun assembling its new March small car in Thailand and will
start making it in Mexico in 2011.  
 Nissan will cut output in Japan by about 20 percent from
October compared with its September production plan because of
the yen’s strength and the expiration of government subsidies in
the nation, Yokohama-based spokesman  Mitsuru Yonekawa  said today.  
 Mexican Production  
 The company’s U.S. factories are in Tennessee and
Mississippi. The company exports U.S.-built light trucks to the
Middle East and has shipped Quest minivans to China.  
 “We will continue to do that, and if the markets continue
to grow we will be happy to do it,” Tavares said.  
 Steve Parrett , a spokesman for Nissan’s U.S. unit, said he
couldn’t immediately provide details on the current volume of
vehicle exports from the U.S. to markets outside North America.  
 The investment in Mexico, and the addition of
subcompact car production there next year, increases the
nation’s importance as Nissan’s export hub for Latin America,
Tavares said.  
 “Markets in Latin America are booming,” said Tavares, 51.
“Most probably we’ll produce 530,000 units in our Mexican
operations in fiscal 2010, an all-time record.”  
 The company has the largest market share in Mexico and was
the top producer of vehicles there last year, making 355,414
units.
