             Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China Ltd.  plans to raise as much as 45 billion yuan ($6.6
billion) to replenish capital, adding to share sales by
 Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  and China Everbright Bank Co.  
 The world’s biggest lender by market value will sell as
many as 0.6 shares for every 10 held, or up to 15.06 billion
shares in Shanghai and 4.98 billion in Hong Kong, according to a
 statement  yesterday.  
 ICBC’s offer brings to more than $60 billion the amount
China’s five largest banks are raising after a record $1.4
trillion in lending last year put pressure on capital levels.
Agricultural Bank started trading this month after raising $19.2
billion in the world’s largest initial stock sale in four years,
while Everbright Bank is seeking a Shanghai listing.  
 “Chinese banks may start to face some real pressure from
rising non-performing loans as early as August and September,”
said  James Liu , a Shanghai-based analyst at Sinopac Financial
Holdings Co. “Raising capital now may also be a preparation for
that.”  
 The board of Beijing-based ICBC also approved a plan to
privatize Hong Kong-listed Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China (Asia) Ltd., the statement said. The bank will announce
the details after regulators review the plan, it said. The
rights offer is also subject to regulatory and shareholder
approval.  
 ICBC (Asia) shares have jumped 36 percent this year in Hong
Kong trading. Shares of parent ICBC listed in Hong Kong slipped
8.7 percent in the same period, while the benchmark Hang Seng
Index has dropped 3.6 percent.  
 Shareholder Meeting  
 ICBC will hold a shareholder meeting in Beijing on Sept. 15
to approve the rights offer, the company said.  
 China Construction Bank Corp. , the world’s second-largest
lender by market value, last month won shareholder approval for
a plan to raise as much as 75 billion yuan in a rights offer.  
 ICBC, Construction Bank, Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of
Communications Ltd. will face a capital shortfall of 480 billion
yuan following new requirements for financial strength, ICBC
President  Yang Kaisheng  wrote in an article published in the
21st Century Business Herald in April.  
 Agricultural Bank, the country’s largest bank by customers,
rose 2.2 percent on its debut in Hong Kong on July 16, after
posting the smallest first-day gain among major rivals in
Shanghai a day earlier.  
 The debut followed a drop in Hong Kong’s benchmark index
this year. That contrasts with the earlier IPOs of its four
largest local rivals, who went public in Hong Kong in 2005 and
2006 amid a five-year bull market. The lender also had to
contend with investor concern that a slowdown in China’s
property market might saddle banks with bad loans.  
 Expanding Sale  
 Agricultural Bank today said an option to expand the share
sale in Hong Kong was exercised with the issue of 3.81 billion H
shares at HK$3.20 apiece, according to a statement to the Hong
Kong exchange. The additional sale generated net proceeds of
HK$11.96 billion ($1.54 billion), it said.  
 ICBC completed its record $21.9 billion IPO in October 2006.  
 Everbright Bank, which has been planning an IPO since 2008,
said last week it plans to sell as many as 6.1 billion shares in
Shanghai in an initial public offering that analysts estimate
may rise as much as 18 billion yuan.
