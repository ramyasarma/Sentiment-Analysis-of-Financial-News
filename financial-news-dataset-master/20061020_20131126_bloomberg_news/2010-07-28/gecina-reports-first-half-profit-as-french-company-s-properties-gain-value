             Gecina SA , France’s second-largest
publicly traded property company, reported a first-half profit
after its apartment blocks and offices in Paris gained value.  
 Net income  was 200.9 million euros ($261 million), or 3.27
euros a share, compared with a loss of 510 million euros, or
8.33 euros, a year earlier, the Paris-based company said today
in a statement.  Net asset value  fell 2.1 percent to 98.6 euros a
share after the company sold properties.  
 Paris offices appreciated in the first half as investors
including German funds and French insurers stepped up their
purchases amid signs that prime rents are bottoming out.
Gecina’s real estate appreciated by 186.1 million euros in the
first half. The company booked 1.86 billion euros in writedowns
in the two years through 2009.  
 Gecina forecast an increase of 4 percent to 5 percent in
the value of its assets this year, with rents falling by as much
as 6 percent.  
 Net  cash flow  excluding changes in assets values fell 6
percent to 2.90 euros a share, in line with Gecina’s forecast of
a decline this year, as disposals cut revenue.  Net rental income 
dropped 3.6 percent from a year earlier to 282.3 million euros.  
 Asset Sales  
 Gecina raised 300 million euros from property  disposals  in
the first half. The transactions enabled the company to reduce
net debt to 4.84 billion euros, or 45.7 percent of the value of
its properties, at the end of the first half.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Christophe Clamageran  has targeted
430 million euros of asset sales in 2010 after the company
raised 756 million euros last year.  
 Clamageran, who joined Gecina in November, is focusing the
company on offices, apartment buildings and health care
buildings in France. He plans to sell the company’s Spanish
properties and Gecina’s French warehouse assets.  
 His goal is to reinvest the proceeds mainly in Paris region
office projects and developments, increasing these assets by 80
percent to 9 billion euros by 2014.  
 Gecina  has advanced about 15 percent in Paris trading in
the past six months, more than double the gain for the  French
REITs index  compiled by Amsterdam-based Global Property
Research.
