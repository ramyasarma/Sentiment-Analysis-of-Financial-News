             The yen’s climb to a near 15-year
high versus the dollar may not prompt government intervention to
weaken the currency as it contrasts with a trade-weighted level
that is not particularly strong, according to UBS AG.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY shows the yen’s real effective
exchange rate, a weighted average of its value against 42 major
currencies after adjusting for inflation, and its spot rate
versus the dollar. The yen traded at 87.79 per dollar as of 9:30
a.m. in Tokyo, from 87.90 in New York yesterday. It reached
86.27 on July 16, the most since Dec. 1 and about 2 yen from the
strongest since July 1995.  
 “The Ministry of Finance, the institution responsible for
exchange-rate policy in Japan, has not been vocal about recent
foreign exchange developments, as it has in the past before
intervening,”  Mansoor Mohi-uddin , chief currency strategist in
Singapore at UBS, said in a report yesterday. “Prospects for
Japanese action to weaken the yen still appear low.”  
 Japan’s recovery from recession has been driven by exports
to countries such as the U.S., which could be vulnerable to the
yen’s 5.9 percent advance this year, the best performance among
the greenback’s major peers. The trade-weighted level, which is
calculated by the Bank of Japan, is up 1.3 percent in 2010.  
 Exports accounted for about 13 percent of Japan’s economy
in 2009. Shipments abroad rose 27.7 percent in June from a year
earlier, the Finance Ministry said this week in Tokyo, down from
a 32.1 percent increase in May and 40.4 percent in April. Growth
is forecast to slow in the U.S. and China, Japan’s biggest
export markets.  
 A stronger  yen  dents the competitiveness of Japanese
exports. The government hasn’t intervened in markets to weaken
the currency since 2004, according to Finance Ministry data, and
Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  has refrained from
commenting on the yen’s advance.
