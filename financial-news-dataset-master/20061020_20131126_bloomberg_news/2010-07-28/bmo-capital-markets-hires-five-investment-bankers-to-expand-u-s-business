             BMO Capital Markets, the investment-
banking unit of  Bank of Montreal , hired five managing directors
to expand its U.S. business.  
 The bank hired Alexander “Sandy” Ayer for its mergers and
acquisitions group,  Noam Cohen  for its food, consumer and retail
business, and  Les Gorman  for senior client coverage, all based
in New York, the Toronto-based firm said today in an e-mailed
statement. Paul Griffin was hired to lead the firm’s software
investment banking from Boston and  David Parrot  was hired for
health care, based in San Francisco.  
 BMO Capital Markets is adding expertise in areas including
acquisitions and healthcare after hiring former Lehman Brothers
banker Perry Hoffmeister on April 1 to head the U.S. investment
bank. Bank of Montreal is Canada’s fourth-biggest bank by
assets.  
 Ayer worked for 16 years at firms including JPMorgan Chase
& Co. and Bear Stearns Cos., the company said. Cohen, who was
previously a managing director at Berenson & Co., will lead
BMO’s non-food retailing business.  
 Gorman focused on global media, business services and
telecommunications clients during his 12-year tenure at Lehman
Brothers. Griffin was previously head of software investment
banking at Cowen and Co. LLC.  
 Parrot, who spent the past year as head of healthcare
banking at Montgomery & Co., has more than 20 years of
experience at firms including Piper Jaffray Cos. and Swiss Bank
Corp.
