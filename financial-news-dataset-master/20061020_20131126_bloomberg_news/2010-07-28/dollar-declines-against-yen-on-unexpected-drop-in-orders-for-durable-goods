             The dollar dropped from the highest
level in almost two weeks versus the yen as orders for U.S.
 durable goods  unexpectedly fell last month and the Federal
Reserve said economic growth slowed in some areas.  
 Australia’s dollar slid against all of its major
counterparts as the nation’s consumer prices rose in the second
quarter less than economists forecast, raising speculation that
the central bank will keep borrowing costs unchanged. The yen
advanced against the New Zealand dollar and South African rand
as a drop in U.S. stocks discouraged demand for riskier assets.  
 “Growth for the U.S. for the balance of the year is going
to expand but at a slower pace,” said  Joe Manimbo , a market
analyst in Washington at Travelex Global Business Payments, a
currency-exchange network. “That’s just another weight on the
risk rally.”  
 The dollar decreased 0.5 percent to 87.45 yen at 4:01 p.m.
in New York, from 87.90 yesterday, after touching 88.12, the
highest level since July 15. The euro slid 0.6 percent to 113.57
yen, from 114.24, after rising to 114.74, the highest level
since May 18. The euro traded at $1.2986, compared with $1.2996.  
 New Zealand’s dollar fell 1.2 percent to 63.69 yen and
South Africa’s rand slid 0.8 percent to 11.89 yen as the drop in
orders for durable goods deterred trades in which investors get
funds in a country with low borrowing costs and buy assets where
returns are higher. Japan’s target lending rate of 0.1 percent
makes the yen popular for funding such transactions.  
 Drop in Stocks  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  lost 0.7 percent as the
U.S. economic data outweighed better-than-estimated corporate
profits. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.4 percent.  
 Bookings for U.S. items meant to last at least three years
slid 1 percent last month after falling 0.8 percent in May, the
Commerce Department reported today. The median forecast of 76
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 1 percent gain.  
 Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in testimony
before the Senate Banking Committee on July 21 that “the
economic outlook remains unusually uncertain.”  
 The central bank underscored in its Beige Book business
survey released today its view that the economic recovery, while
still moving forward, is progressing at a slower pace than
earlier in the year. Two of the Fed’s 12 districts reported the
economy “held steady” and two said the expansion slowed.  
 “We’re seeing a little bit of risk aversion in the
market,” said  Melinda Burgess , a foreign-exchange strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. “There’s been a
broad selling dollar theme over the last few weeks as U.S. data
has been weak.”  
 Yen in 2010  
 The yen has advanced 10.3 percent this year in the biggest
gain among developed-world counterparts, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indices. The euro has dropped 7.7
percent, while the dollar is up 2.9 percent.  
 The Bank of Japan board member  Hidetoshi Kamezaki 
highlighted in a speech in Sapporo economic risks of a rising
yen and said the bank will act to combat deflation, a more
aggressive stance than his colleagues have indicated.  
 Nissan Motor Co.  will boost output capacity in Mexico to
about 700,000 vehicles a year and may consider increasing
exports from the U.S. as the strong yen makes North American
production more competitive.  
 The yen was headed for a 1.1 percent monthly gain versus
the dollar and a 4.7 percent drop versus the euro. The dollar
was poised for a 5.7 percent decrease against the euro.  
 The euro may advance about 4 percent against the yen after
it breached a resistance level, according to Technical Alpha, a
New-York based research company.  
 Outlook for Euro  
 The 16-nation euro may rally to a range of 117 to 118.80
yen over the next two months after closing yesterday above
113.85 yen,  James Stellakis , the company’s founder, wrote in an
e-mailed report. The euro hasn’t traded stronger than 118.80 yen
since May, according to Bloomberg data.  
 A resistance level is an area on a chart where orders to
sell a currency versus a counterpart may be placed, potentially
blocking an advance.  
 The Australian dollar slid 1.1 percent to 89.23 U.S. cents
and dropped 1.7 percent to 78.02 yen after the Bureau of
Statistics said consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in the second
quarter. The median estimate of 21 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a gain of 1 percent.  
 The Reserve Bank of Australia is forecast to keep the
benchmark cash target at 4.5 percent on Aug. 3, according to the
median estimate of 19 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 New Zealand’s central bank will increase its target lending
rate by a quarter-percentage point to 3 percent at 9 a.m. in
Wellington tomorrow, according to all 14 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The kiwi surged yesterday to a six-month
high of 73.97 U.S. cents as traders bet borrowing costs would
keep rising.
