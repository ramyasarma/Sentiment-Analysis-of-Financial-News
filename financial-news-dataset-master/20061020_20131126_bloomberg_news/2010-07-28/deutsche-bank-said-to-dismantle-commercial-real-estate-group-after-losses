             Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s largest
lender, is dismantling a group that advises companies on
commercial real estate transactions, according to people with
knowledge of the matter.  
 Warren Friend , a managing director who ran the New York-
based division, may be leaving the bank, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the move hasn’t been
announced. The bank is seeking to find positions for affected
employees, including Friend, one of the people said.  
 “Commercial real estate is becoming part of our credit and
emerging markets business,” spokesman  John Gallagher  said in an
e-mailed statement. “The group is very much open for
business.”  
 Deutsche Bank is pulling back from advising clients on real
estate financing as it grapples with losses on transactions
struck before the credit crisis, such as  Station Casinos Inc. 
and Cosmopolitan Resort & Casino, both of Las Vegas. The
Frankfurt-based bank said July 27 it took a 124 million euro
($161 million) impairment charge for the quarter on
Cosmopolitan.  
 Friend, who worked at Morgan Stanley prior to joining
Deutsche Bank last year, didn’t return phone calls seeking
comment.  
 While closing the division, Deutsche Bank will continue to
originate commercial mortgages for sale as Wall Street attempts
to revive the $700 billion market, the people said.  
 Sales of commercial mortgage bonds tumbled 95 percent to
$11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in 2007,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks arranged $3.4
billion of the securities last year, and about $1.7 billion has
been issued in 2010.  
 Senior real estate bankers who have left Deutsche Bank
include former head of commercial real estate  Jon Vaccaro , who
joined Ranieri Real Estate Partners, and  Eric Schwartz , a co-
head in the firm’s commercial real estate group, the firm said
in a statement on July 12.
