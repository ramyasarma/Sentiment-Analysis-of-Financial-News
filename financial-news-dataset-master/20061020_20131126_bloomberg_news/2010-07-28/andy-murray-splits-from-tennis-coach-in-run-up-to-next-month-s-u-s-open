             Andy Murray , the fourth-ranked men’s
tennis player, parted company with coach Miles Maclagan about a
month before the U.S. Open in New York.  
 Murray, 23, split from Maclagan, a former British Davis Cup
player, “following a review of his coaching needs,” according
to a  statement  posted on his website late yesterday.  
 “Andy is completely focused on the U.S. hardcourt season
and he will review the situation after the U.S. Open,” his
management company 19 Entertainment said in the statement.  
 The U.S. Open, the year’s final Grand Slam tournament,
starts Aug. 30. Murray is currently playing in Los Angeles at
the Farmers Classic, his first event since losing in the
semifinals at Wimbledon.  
 Maclagan, 35, joined Murray’s coaching team in 2007 and
helped his fellow Scot reach his first two major finals at the
2008 U.S. Open and 2010 Australian Open, where he lost on both
occasions to  Roger Federer . Murray hasn’t won a title in 2010.
