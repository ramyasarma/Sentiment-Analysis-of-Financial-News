             Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  fell as a government report showed durable goods orders
unexpectedly dropped in the U.S. and the Federal Reserve said
the nation’s economic recovery slowed.  
 American depositary receipts of Nissan Motor Co., a
carmaker that counts North America as its largest market,
retreated 2 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those
of Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Australia’s second-largest oil and
gas producer, dropped 0.4 percent after oil prices fell. ADRs of
Panasonic Corp. tumbled 3.6 percent on concern the Japanese
electronics maker will raise capital for acquisitions. The
Federal Reserve’s Beige Book business survey showed U.S. growth
was slowing in some areas.  
 Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
September closed at 9,680 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,730 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,680 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
 S&P/ASX 200 Index  sank 0.5 percent today. New Zealand’s  NZX 50
Index  dropped 0.3 percent in Wellington.  
 “Durable goods orders and the Beige Book confirmed
business sentiment is worsening and economic growth is
slowing,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees the equivalent of
$450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “People are waiting for the Fed’s next step.”  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were almost
unchanged at 1,102.00. In New York, the index lost 0.7 percent
to 1,106.13.  
 Durable Goods Orders  
 The U.S. Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders
for durable goods dropped 1 percent, depressed by a decrease in
demand for aircraft which is often volatile. Economists forecast
total orders would climb 1 percent, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 The Fed’s Beige Book showed commercial real estate and the
expiration of a tax credit for homebuyers were weighing on the
economy in some areas.  
 “Economic activity has continued to increase, on balance,
since the previous survey,” the Fed said yesterday in its Beige
Book business survey, while noting that two of the Fed’s 12
districts reported the economy “held steady” and two said the
expansion slowed.  
 Valuations, Yen  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has lost 0.9 percent in 2010,
compared with a 0.8 percent drop by the  S&P 500  and a 1.3
percent gain by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.4 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 13.4 times for the S&P and 11.9 times for the Stoxx.  
 The yen appreciated to 87.34, compared with 87.83 against
the dollar at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency strengthened to 113.44 from
114.24. The stronger yen reduces income when overseas revenue is
converted into local currency.  
 Crude oil for September delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
$76.99 a barrel in New York.  
 Panasonic  may buy the shares of Sanyo Electric Co. and
Panasonic Electric Works Co. this year at a combined cost of
about 900 billion yen ($10.3 billion), Nikkei English News
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.
Panasonic wants to unify management and focus on such areas as
rechargeable batteries and household goods, Nikkei reported.
Shares of Sanyo, Panasonic and Panasonic Electric Works were
suspended from trading.  
 “The news is negative in the short term because of
concerns about a capital increase,” Ichiyoshi’s Akino said.
“But in the long term, the strategy is positive for the company
because it should help it use its management resources more
efficiently and boost shareholder value.”
