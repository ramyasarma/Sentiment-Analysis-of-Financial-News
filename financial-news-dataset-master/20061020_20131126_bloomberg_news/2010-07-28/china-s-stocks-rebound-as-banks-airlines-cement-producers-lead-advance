             China’s stocks rebounded as cement
producers rallied on a government development plan for the
industry and brokerages raised their recommendation for airlines
on increasing tourism.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.4 percent to 2,585.53
at 10:30 a.m. local time. Banks also gained for the first time
in three days after a recent selloff spurred by concerns about
lending to local governments.
