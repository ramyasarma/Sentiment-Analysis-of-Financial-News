             New Zealand’s dollar declined after
the Reserve Bank said “the outlook for economic growth has
softened somewhat.”  
 The RBNZ made that statement as it raised interest rates
for the second month in a row.  
 The New Zealand dollar dropped to 72.15 U.S. cents as of
9:05 a.m. in Wellington, from 72.73 cents yesterday in New York.
Australia’s dollar fell 0.2 percent to 89.16 U.S. cents.
