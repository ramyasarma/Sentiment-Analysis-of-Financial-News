             Finmeccanica SpA, Italy’s biggest
defense company, said first-half net income fell to 170 million
euros from 218 million euros a year earlier, according to a
statement distributed through the Italian exchange.  
 That compares with the 229 million-euro average estimate of
seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
