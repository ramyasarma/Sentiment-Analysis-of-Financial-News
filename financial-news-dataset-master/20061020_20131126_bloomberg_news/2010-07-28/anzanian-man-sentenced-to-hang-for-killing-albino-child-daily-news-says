             A Tanzanian man was sentenced to
death by hanging for murdering a 5-year-old albino child whose
body was discovered in 2008 with the legs cut off and drained of
blood, the  Daily News  reported, citing a high court ruling.  
 Kazimiri Mashauri, 50, was sentenced to death to show that
the East African nation won’t tolerate the ritual murder of
people with albinism, the Dar es Salaam-based newspaper said,
citing Judge  Projest Rugazia .  
 Dozens of albinos have been reported murdered in Tanzania
where witchdoctors spread the false belief that expensive
concoctions made from albinos’ limbs, genitals, hair and skin
will bring good luck. Albinism is a genetic disorder in which
the body is unable to produce skin, hair and eye pigmentation.
