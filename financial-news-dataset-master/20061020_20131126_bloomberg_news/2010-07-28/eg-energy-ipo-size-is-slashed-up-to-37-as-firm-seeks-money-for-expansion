             The initial public offering of
shares by MEG Energy Corp., a Canadian oil-sands developer
partly owned by China’s  Cnooc Ltd. , was reduced by as much as 37
percent, according to two people familiar with the matter.  
 MEG is now planning sell 20 million shares for between C$35
and C$39 each, down from 23 million shares for C$42 to C$48,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
the information isn’t public. Reuters reported the cut earlier.  
 MEG, based in Calgary, is using the IPO to finance the
expansion of its Christina Lake project in Alberta. The prior
offering price would have raised as much as C$1.1 billion ($1.06
billion), compared with the new minimum of C$700 million.  
 The sale, expected to be priced today, will be the second-
largest IPO in Canada this year, after the C$1.35 billion
offering by  Athabasca Oil Sands Corp.  in April. MEG Energy may
trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol MEG.  
 MEG Chief Financial Officer  Dale Hohm  declined comment
until after the sale is priced.  
 Credit Suisse Securities Canada is leading a group of nine
banks including  BMO Nesbitt Burns , Barclays Capital Canada and
Morgan Stanley Canada for the sale.
