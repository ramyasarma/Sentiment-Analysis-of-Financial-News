             The Australian dollar fell after a
government report showed consumer prices rose in the second
quarter at a slower pace than economists had estimated, giving
policy makers scope to hold interest rates unchanged next week.  
 The so-called Aussie traded at 89.60 U.S. cents as of 11:31
a.m. in Sydney from 90.09 cents before the report.
