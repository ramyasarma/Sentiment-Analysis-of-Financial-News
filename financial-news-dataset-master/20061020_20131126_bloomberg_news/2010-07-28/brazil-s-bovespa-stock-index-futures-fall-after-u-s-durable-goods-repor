             Brazil’s Bovespa stock-index futures
erased gains and fell after a report showed orders for
durable goods in the U.S. unexpectedly declined in June, adding
to evidence the country’s economic recovery is slowing.  
 Bovespa futures fell 0.3 percent to 66,895 at 8:49 a.m. New
York time.  
 Total orders for durable goods, those meant to last at
least three years, dropped 1 percent in June, depressed by a
decrease in demand for aircraft, Commerce Department figures
showed. The guage was forecast to increase 1 percent, based on
the median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
