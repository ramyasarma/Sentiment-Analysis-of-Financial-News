             Cash premiums for corn shipped to
export terminals near New Orleans fell relative to Chicago
futures after prices jumped the most this month, eroding demand
for inventories. Soybeans premiums were unchanged.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivery in July
dropped to 29 cents to 33 cents a bushel above September futures
from 30 cents to 33 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The  average spot premium  fell to the
lowest level in more than six months. Soybean premiums for
delivery this month were unchanged at 78 cents to 90 cents above
August futures.  
 “The cash corn market is weak with most elevators and
processors holding what they need before the harvest begins” in
September, said  Ron Uhe , a risk consultant for Mid-Co
Commodities Inc. in Bloomington, Illinois. “There is limited
commercial ownership of soybeans, and farmers are holding the
majority of what’s left” from last year, Uhe said.  
 Corn futures for September delivery rose 13.5 cents, or 3.7
percent, to settle at $3.7625 a bushel at 1:28 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest gain since June 30.
Yesterday, the price closed at the lowest level this month on
bets that rains will boost yields.  
 Soybean futures for August delivery rose 12.5 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $10.105 a bushel at 1:31 p.m. in Chicago.
On July 16, the contract reached $10.27, the highest price since
Jan. 8.  
 As of June 1, oilseed  inventories  from last year’s harvest
were 571 million bushels, the USDA said June 30. That marked the
lowest level since 2004.
