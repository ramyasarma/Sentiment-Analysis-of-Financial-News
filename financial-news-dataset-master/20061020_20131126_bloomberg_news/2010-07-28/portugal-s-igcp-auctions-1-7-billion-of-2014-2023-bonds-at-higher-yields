             Portugal’s government debt agency,
the IGCP, said it sold 600 million euros ($780 million) of bonds 
due in 2014 and 681 million euros of bonds maturing in 2023.  
 The securities due October 2014 were issued at an average
yield of 3.621 percent, the country’s debt management agency
said. That compares with an average yield of 2.759 percent at a
previous auction of the same-maturity debt on Nov. 11. The
auction attracted bids for 3.1 times the amount offered,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.4 in November.  
 The bonds due October 2023 were issued at an average yield
of 5.377 percent. That compares with an average yield of 4.416
percent at a previous auction of the same-maturity debt on Jan.
13. Today’s auction attracted bids for 1.6 times the amount
offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2 in the January
sale.  
 The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, on July 22 said the
total indicative amount for both bonds in today’s auction would
range between 750 Million euros and 1.25 billion euros.
