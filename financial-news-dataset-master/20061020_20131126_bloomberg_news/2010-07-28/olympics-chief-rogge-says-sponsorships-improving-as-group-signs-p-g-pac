President  Jacques Rogge  said the climate for sponsorship
agreements is getting better after the Games’ governing body
signed its second global agreement in less than two weeks.  
 “The economy has not recovered at full but definitely the
big crisis is hopefully over,” Rogge said in an interview
yesterday in London, where the agreement with  Procter & Gamble
Co.  was announced. “There is an improving sponsorship
climate.”  
 P&G, the world’s largest consumer-products company, agreed
to become a worldwide Olympic sponsor through 2020. The IOC and
the maker of Pampers diapers and Olay skin products didn’t
disclose financial details of the decade-long deal, which covers
the next five Games starting with London 2012.  
 Dow Chemical Co. , the world’s second-largest chemical
maker, agreed on July 16 to become a worldwide sponsor of the
Olympics through 2020. Other top-tier sponsors of the IOC
include  General Electric Co.  and Visa Inc.  
 “Companies do invest more than they used to do,” said
Rogge, a former orthopedic surgeon who competed for Belgium in
the yachting competitions of three Olympics. “In 2007, 2008 and
the beginning of 2009, there was a very cautious attitude. Most
companies were holding cash, and did not want to invest. That is
changing nowadays.”  
 The IOC has raised almost $1 billion in income from 11 top-
tier sponsors for its four-year cycle ending in 2014,  Gerhard Heiberg , chairman of the IOC’s marketing commission, said at a
joint press conference with P&G in London.  
 Sponsor Search  
 Rogge said the IOC wants to add one more worldwide
sponsorship.  
 “We will not go beyond 12 because otherwise we would
start diluting the message and the activities,” he said. “We
are discussing with a number of companies and there are a number
of issues in the pipeline but still nothing finally confirmed.”  
 P&G sponsored the  U.S. Olympic team  during this year’s
 Vancouver Winter Games . The global sponsorship agreement will
give the company better access to new markets, such as Russia,
which hosts the next Winter Games in Sochi, and Brazil, where
Rio will host the 2016 Olympics, it said.  
 “One of the things that P&G is doing is expanding our
footprint into emerging markets,”  Marc Pritchard , the company’s
global marketing and brand building officer, said in an
interview yesterday. “We want to eventually reach all of the
world’s consumers. The fact that Sochi and Rio were part of the
program really was excellent for us.”  
 The IOC is supportive of the sponsorship agreement between
the organizers of the  London 2012 Olympics  and  BP Plc , despite
the company’s role in the worst oil spill in U.S. history in the
Gulf of Mexico, Rogge said.  
 “Of course we are concerned by what has happened, this is
a disaster, everyone agrees with that,” Rogge said. “As long
as BP takes what I would call corrective actions for the future,
and reparation for the past, as soon as they have the policy of
the care for the environment and sustainability, we believe that
London can continue to have them as a sponsor.”
