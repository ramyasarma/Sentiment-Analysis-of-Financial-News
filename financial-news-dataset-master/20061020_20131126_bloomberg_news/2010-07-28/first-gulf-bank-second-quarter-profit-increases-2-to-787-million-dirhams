             First Gulf Bank PJSC  said second-
quarter profit rose 2 percent, less than analysts’ expected, as
the United Arab Emirates lender controlled by Abu Dhabi’s ruling
family set aside more money to cover for bad loans.  
 Net income climbed to 787 million dirhams ($214 million)
from 775 million dirhams a year earlier, the Abu Dhabi-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement today. That compares with the
mean estimate of 845.8 million dirhams in a  Bloomberg survey  of
eight analysts. Provisions, including for bad loans, rose 47
percent to 411 million dirhams, the statement said.  
 First Gulf Bank “maintained its top line momentum for the
second quarter of 2010,” building on its start to the year,
Chief Executive Officer André Sayegh said in the statement.  
 U.A.E. banks are recovering from the global credit crisis,
which weakened lending and investment banking, while provisions
for bad loans are rising amid the economic slowdown. U.A.E.
economic growth may accelerate to 3.2 percent in 2010 with oil
prices at $85 a barrel from 1.3 percent in 2009, U.A.E.
Economy Minister  Sultan Bin Saeed al-Mansouri  said in May.  
 Interest income from loans and Islamic financing advanced 9
percent to 1.04 billion dirhams, while fee and commission income
rose 21 percent to 357 million dirhams, the bank said. Total
costs rose 4 percent in the quarter to 268 million dirhams.  
 FGB is likely to book provisions of 468 million dirhams in
the quarter, Dubai-based Shuaa Capital PSC said ahead of the
results.  
 Bad Loans  
 The bank’s non-performing loans as a percentage of the
total was 2.5 percent in the quarter, it said. The loan book
grew 4 percent at the end of June from December to 94.2 billion
dirhams, while deposits rose 2 percent to 88.4 billion dirhams.  
 Emirates NBD PJSC , the U.A.E.’s biggest bank by assets,
reported July 26 a worse-than-expected 53 percent decline in
second-quarter profit to 398.2 million dirhams as it set aside
money to cover bad loans including holdings in state-owned
Dubai World.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , the second-biggest
bank, said yesterday quarterly earnings rose 10.4 percent to
 1 billion dirhams, ahead of analysts’ estimates.  
 First Gulf Bank closed unchanged at 14.45 dirhams ahead of
the earnings report. The stock has fallen 10 percent this year.
