             Rain in  Brazil  next week may disrupt
sugar loading at the country’s two biggest ports, threatening to
worsen a record lineup of ships waiting to export the sweetener.  
 A record 115 vessels were waiting to load 3.53 million
metric tons of sugar at Brazil’s six main ports yesterday,
according to consultant Santos Associados Consultoria Ltda. and
shipping company Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos Ltda. The
backlog is more than twice as big as last year, when 46 ships
were waiting to export the sweetener.  
 Loading may be further delayed as a cold front moves into
southern and southeastern Brazil, bringing a week of rainfall
starting Aug. 1, Celso Oliveira, a meteorologist for  Somar
Meteorologia , said today by telephone from Sao Paulo.  
 “Every day we miss means the lineup is heading for a new
record,” Nicolle Alves de Castro, a commercial assistant for
 Santos Associados , said today in a telephone interview from
Santos, Brazil.  
 Ports are forced to halt sugar loading amid rainfall
because the precipitation ruins the product.  
 The  Port of Santos , Brazil’s largest, is able to load
213,000 tons of sugar a day, and the Port of Paranagua, the
country’s second biggest, can load 50,000 tons a day.  
 Latin America’s largest economy ships 54 percent of the
world’s sugar exports, up from 20 percent a decade ago,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .
