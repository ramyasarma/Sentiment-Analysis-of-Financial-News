             Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. plan to sell $788.5 million of bonds backed by
commercial mortgages, according to a person familiar with the
offering.  
 The issue contains debt on 48 properties, said the person
who declined to be identified because terms aren’t public.
Retail account for 78.2 percent of the pool and offices make up
10.4 percent, the person said.  
 The offering comes as Wall Street works to revive the $700
billion market after sales tumbled 95 percent to $11.2 billion
in 2008, choking off funds to borrowers. Banks arranged $3.4
billion of the securities last year, and about $1.7 billion has
been sold in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The current offering marks the third sale to pool
commercial mortgages from multiple borrowers this year,
Bloomberg data show. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the most recent
issuer, with a $716.3 million offering on June 11.  
 Borrowers are struggling to secure enough financing to pay
off maturing mortgages amid tighter underwriting standards and
property prices down 39 percent from 2007 peaks, according to
Moody’s Investors Service.
