             Former Spain striker  Raul Gonzalez 
signed a two-year contract with Schalke, the German Bundesliga
club said.  
 Raul, 33, left Real Madrid two days ago after scoring a
club-record 323 goals and winning six Spanish league and three
Champions League titles in 16 years. He moves to Schalke on a
free transfer.  
 “I’m delighted we’ve been able to inspire such an
exceptional footballer and world-class striker to move to the
Bundesliga and Schalke,” manager  Felix Magath  said on the
 club’s website . “Raul’s qualities will help us move forward.”  
 Raul also scored 44 goals in 102 games for the Spanish
national team from 1996 to 2006. He holds Champions League
records with 66 goals scored and 130 games played.  
 Schalke was runner-up to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga
last season. It was the fourth second-place finish in 10 seasons
for the club, which won its last German league title in 1958.
