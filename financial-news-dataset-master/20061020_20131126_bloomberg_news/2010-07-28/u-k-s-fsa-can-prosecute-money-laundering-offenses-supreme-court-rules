             The Financial Services Authority,
the U.K.’s market regulator, has the power to prosecute money-
laundering offenses, the Supreme Court ruled.  
 It would be “perverse” to limit the FSA’s power to
prosecute white-collar criminals, the U.K.’s highest court said
in a judgment today.  
 The agency’s roles include “the reduction of financial
crime,” the court said. “One of the ways that the FSA might
reasonably consider that this objective can be met is by
prosecuting those who commit offenses of a financial nature.”  
 Today’s ruling follows plans announced by Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  to abolish the FSA and give most of its
power to the Bank of England. The FSA’s prosecutorial powers may
be combined with those of the Serious Fraud Office and the
Office of Fair Trading to create a proposed economic crime
agency.  
 The case was brought by Neil Rollins, accused by the FSA of
both insider dealing and money laundering. Steve Milner,
Rollins’s lawyer, didn’t immediately respond to a message
seeking comment.
