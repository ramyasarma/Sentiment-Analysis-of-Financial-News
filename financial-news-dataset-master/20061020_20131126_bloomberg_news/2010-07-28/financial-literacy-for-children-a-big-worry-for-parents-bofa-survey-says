             Teaching children how to be
financially savvy is almost as important as maintaining a close
relationship with family, according to  Bank of America Corp.   
 The Merrill Lynch Affluent Insights Quarterly, which
surveyed 1,000 Americans in June with investable assets of at
least $250,000, found that 51 percent cited “financial know-
how” as the most important life lesson to share with their
children. That compares with 54 percent who named maintaining
ties to family, 26 percent who said choosing the right spouse
and 11 percent who mentioned staying physically fit.  
 “Cash and debt management, along with their children’s
financial literacy, have become increasingly important to our
clients as they juggle often competing financial demands while
hoping to teach the next generation how to effectively manage
their own money,”  Dean Athanasia , head of banking and the
direct investment division for Bank of America Global Wealth and
Investment Management, said in a statement.  
 As uncertainty over jobs and long-term economic recovery
increases, affluent investors are worried about rising college
and retirement costs, the survey said. About 40 percent of
respondents said they are concerned about the rising cost of
college education and 46 percent are worried about their ability
to preserve an inheritance for their children.  
 The study, which was conducted by Princeton, New Jersey-
based marketing  research firm  Braun Research, found that 70
percent of respondents don’t think their retirement plan is
adequate in providing for unexpected events or illness of a
family member.  
 Job Loyalty  
 Retirement benefits are the No. 1 reason for loyalty among
employers after compensation and promotions, with 60 percent
citing those benefits as the main consideration in staying with
their employer, the survey said.  
 More employees are moving back their expected retirement
dates, with 45 percent of affluent individuals planning to
retire later than planned compared with 29 percent in January
2010.  
 When it comes to seeking financial advice, most affluent
Americans turn to financial advisers and their spouses rather
than their own parents. Almost 60 percent consult financial
advisers or a spouse when contemplating a financial decision,
while only 12 percent turn to their parents, the survey said.  
 The survey was conducted for Merrill Lynch Global Wealth
Management, a unit of the bank.
