             Porsche AG ’s supervisory board
approved production of the 918 Spyder hybrid sports car, a model
that soars to 100 kilometers an hour in 3.2 seconds and may top
the Carrera GT as the manufacturer’s costliest vehicle.  
 Porsche plans to develop the vehicle at a research facility
near Stuttgart, Germany, where the carmaker is based, the
company said today in an e-mailed statement. The car will be
built at the main plant in Zuffenhausen.  
 The 918 Spyder, one of three hybrid models Porsche
presented at the Geneva auto show in March, has attracted at
least 2,000 non-binding submissions of interest, people familiar
with the matter said on July 12. Porsche needs at least 1,000
sales pledges to sign off on building the car, development chief
 Wolfgang Duerheimer  said in April.  
 The supercar may be priced at about 500,000 euros
($650,000), topping the 453,000-euro Carrera GT of which no more
than 1,500 units were produced. The 918 Spyder may be introduced
as early as 2013, according to  Tim Schuldt , an analyst at
Equinet AG in Frankfurt who recommends buying the stock.  
 The two-seater car accelerates to a top speed of 320
kilometers (199 miles) per hour, relying on a 500-horsepower V8
engine and electric drive-systems that allow the vehicle to run
up to 25 kilometers on electric power.  
 Porsche agreed with worker representations on July 21 on
measures to preserve jobs and improve productivity through 2015.
The accord includes a pledge to build the 918 Spyder if the car
draws sufficient interest, people familiar with the matter said
on July 23.  
 Porsche plans to add models with a goal of doubling annual
sales to as many as 150,000 vehicles over the medium term, and
benefit from savings from a planned merger with  Volkswagen AG .
