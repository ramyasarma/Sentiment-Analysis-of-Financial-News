             Jochen Sanio , the president of
BaFin, Germany’s financial regulator, said Germany won’t block a
new Basel accord,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  
 Germany didn’t sign an interim agreement this week because
decisive questions, such as how much capital will be required
and what it has to consist of, haven’t been clarified, Sanio
told the newspaper. Provisions for a transitional period are
also lacking, Boersen-Zeitung cited the BaFin chief as saying.
