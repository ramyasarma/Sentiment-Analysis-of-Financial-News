             Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ,
the world’s biggest maker of generic drugs, slid to the lowest
in almost nine months after U.S. regulators granted priority
review to Merck KGAA’s cladribine multiple sclerosis treatment.  
 The  shares  retreated 2.7 percent to 191 shekels, the lowest
since Nov. 3, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. The stock has
lost 9.5 percent this week.  
 This “tightens the belt around Teva’s waist as the oral
version will compete with its Copaxone,” said  Jonathan Kreizman , an analyst at Tel Aviv-based Clal Finance Brokerage
Ltd.  
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to rule
on the treatment in the fourth quarter, Merck said today.
Novartis AG won a regulatory panel’s backing of its Gilenia
tablet on June 10.  
 Teva tumbled the most in 21 months two days ago after the
FDA on July 23 approved marketing generic versions of Sanofi-
Aventis SA’s Lovenox anti-clotting drug, a decision that raised
concern about possible generics to Copaxone because both drugs
have a complex molecular structure.
