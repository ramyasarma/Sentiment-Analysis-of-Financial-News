             Cocoa futures rose for a fourth
session, capping the longest rally in a month, as rain and black
pod disease threaten crops in Ivory Coast, the world’s top
exporter. Coffee prices also gained.  
 Weeks of heavy precipitation in the Ivory Coast’s southwest
triggered a black pod outbreak that may curb output, cocoa
farmers and officials said. Growers in the Soubre region, which
accounts for about a quarter of the nation’s production, said
they lack the means to prevent the spread of disease during the
annual rainy season.  
 “There’s been a lot of rain in West Africa, and this is
causing a lot of concern about the crop,” said  Tom Mikulski , a
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.  
 Cocoa for September delivery climbed $30, or 1 percent, to
close at $3,010 a metric ton at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. The four-session rally was the longest since June 24.  
 Supplies often are limited before harvests begin in October
in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the second-biggest grower,  Laurent Pipitone , the chief statistician at the International Cocoa
Organization, said this week. Global output trailed demand in
three of the past four years, forcing processors to dig deeper
into inventories, he said.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery fell 9 pounds, or 0.4
percent, to close at 2,271 pounds ($3,539) a ton on the Liffe
exchange in London at 4:50 p.m. local time.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery gained 3.65
cents, or 2.2 percent, to close at $1.674 a pound at 2 p.m. in
New York.  
 Robusta-coffee futures for September delivery rose $22, or
1.3 percent, to settle at $1,721 a ton at 5:30 p.m. in London.
