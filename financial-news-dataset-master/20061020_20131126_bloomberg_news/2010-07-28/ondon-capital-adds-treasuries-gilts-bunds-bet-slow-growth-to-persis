             London & Capital Group Holdings Plc ,
a U.K. fund manager, bought more U.S., German and British debt
in the past six weeks, betting the nations’ efforts to control
deficits will hamper growth and keep interest rates low.  
 “Countries are grappling with the difficulties of
containing debt so there’s little scope for interest rates to go
higher,”  Sanjay Joshi , who oversees about $500 million as a
portfolio manager at the London-based company, said in an
interview. “We increased our allocation of government bonds
including five-year Treasuries, bunds and gilts.”  
 U.S. debt handed investors a 6.1 percent profit so far this
year and German debt returned 5.9 percent, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies, as Greece’s debt crisis and signs global
growth is slowing boosted demand for the assets. Data yesterday
showed confidence among U.S. consumers fell in July to a five-
month low as unemployment hampered expansion.  
 “‘We have a constructive outlook on government bonds
because of the low growth, low inflation and low interest-rate
outlook,” Joshi said.
