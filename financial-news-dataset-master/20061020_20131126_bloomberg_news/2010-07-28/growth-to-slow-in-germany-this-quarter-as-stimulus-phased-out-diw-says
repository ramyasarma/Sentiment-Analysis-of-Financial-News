             The German economy’s expansion will
slow to 0.5 percent in the three months ending September from
1.1 percent in the second quarter as demand for exports declines
and stimulus programs are phased out, the DIW institute said.  
 The “positive development of foreign trade” drove the
expansion in Europe’s biggest economy in the second quarter, the
Berlin-based DIW said today in an e-mailed report. Output at
carmakers and in the chemicals industry returned to near pre-
crisis levels, while machinery makers also recouped some of the
losses compared with a year earlier, it said.  
 The Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden will present a
first official estimate of second-quarter growth on Aug. 13.
