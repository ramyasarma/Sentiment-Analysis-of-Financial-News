             Daiwa Securities Group Inc. , Japan’s
second-biggest brokerage, fell behind  Nikko Cordial Securities
Inc.  in bond underwriting fees for the first time, after ending
a joint venture with Nikko’s parent, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc.  
 Daiwa’s bond underwriting fees fell 22 percent to 2.1
billion yen ($23.9 million) in the first fiscal quarter ended
June 30 from the fourth quarter, while Nikko’s fees were little
changed at 2.5 billion yen, the companies said in financial
statements this week.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Shigeharu Suzuki  also faces a
downturn in equity underwriting deals in Japan, which slumped 63
percent during the first quarter from a year earlier, and is
seeking business overseas to plug the gaps. The 10-year
investment banking venture between Daiwa and Sumitomo Mitsui was
dissolved in December following Sumitomo Mitsui’s acquisition of
Nikko.  
 “It’s possible for a brokerage to become the lead
underwriter by simply cutting prices, but Daiwa operates its
business to be profitable,” Chief Financial Officer  Nobuyuki Iwamoto  told reporters in Tokyo yesterday after Daiwa reported
earnings.  
 Daiwa slipped to fifth place in bond underwriting in Japan
in the three months through June from the first place in the
quarter ended March, while Nikko rose to No. 4 from No. 5,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Mandate Loss  
 Nikko was the lead underwriter for affiliate Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp.’s 100 billion yen bond sales in April and
July. Daiwa was the lead underwriter for the bank in 2009 and
2008, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Daiwa reported a first-quarter loss of 1.19 billion yen,
compared with net income of 17.9 billion yen a year ago and a
loss of 2.8 billion yen in the three months through March.  
 Nikko Cordial said on July 26 that first-quarter profit
rose 24 percent to 10.2 billion yen.  
 Iwamoto said Daiwa isn’t seeking new alliances to replace
the dissolved venture with Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan’s third-
largest publicly traded bank by assets.  
 Daiwa’s  shares , which have fallen 18 percent this year,
rose 2.1 percent to 383 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.
The benchmark Topix index gained 2.3 percent.  
 Harris Associates LP today reported to the Ministry of
Finance that it increased its stake in the Japanese brokerage to
8.27 percent from 7.19 percent, as of July 23.
