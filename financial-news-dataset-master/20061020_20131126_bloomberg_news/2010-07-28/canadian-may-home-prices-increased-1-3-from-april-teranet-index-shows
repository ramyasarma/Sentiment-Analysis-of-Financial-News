             Canadian home resale prices rose for
a 13th straight month in May, the longest streak since September
2006, the  Teranet-National Bank  Composite House Price Index
showed.  
 The monthly gain of 1.3 percent was led by a 2.3 percent
increase in Ottawa, followed by 1.8 percent in Montreal,
according to a report today by National Bank Financial. Overall
prices rose 13.6 percent from May 2009. The index has tracked
home-price changes in six Canadian cities -- Calgary, Halifax,
Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver -- since February 2000.  
 Housing investment should slow through this year and into
2011 after spending was pulled forward by  low mortgage rates  and
temporary tax credits, the Bank of Canada said July 22. The
central bank raised its key lending rate for a second month to
0.75 percent on July 20 and said further action would be
“weighed carefully” against an economic recovery.  
 “We do not believe that acceleration in the Teranet-
National Bank index will be sustained,”  Marc Pinsonneault , an
economist with National Bank Financial in Montreal, wrote in a
note to clients.
