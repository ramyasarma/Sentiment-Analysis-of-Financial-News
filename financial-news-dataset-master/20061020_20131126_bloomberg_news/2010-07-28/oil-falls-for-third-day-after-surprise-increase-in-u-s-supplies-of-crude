             Crude oil rose in New York for the
first time in five days as the dollar fell against the euro,
bolstering investor demand for commodities.  
 Oil climbed above $77 a barrel as the dollar dropped for
the fifth day in six against the 16-nation euro. Futures
yesterday declined to a one-week low after U.S. crude imports
jumped to the highest level in almost four years, leading to an
unexpected increase in commercially held  inventories .  
 “Sentiment is very mixed,”  Jonathan Barratt , managing
director at Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney, said by
telephone. “The oil market looks to be nicely controlled within
a range. The fundamental story is not clear. We saw inventory
builds at a time when we didn’t expect them to rise.”  
 Crude for September delivery gained as much as 46 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $77.45 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $77.29 at 3:18 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract fell 51 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $76.99, the lowest settlement since July 21. Futures
have gained 22 percent in the past year.  
 The dollar fell to $1.3046 per euro from $1.2995 yesterday
in New York. The common currency has been pushed higher this
week after stress-test results released July 21 showed only
seven European banks needed to raise capital.  
 U.S. crude stockpiles increased 7.3 million barrels to
360.8 million in the week ended July 23, a four-week high, the
Energy Department said in a report yesterday.  Imports surged 
1.18 million barrels a day, or 12 percent, to 11.2 million, the
highest rate since the week to Aug. 25, 2006.  
 Durable Goods  
 Oil has rebounded from as much as 14 percent of losses this
year amid speculation global fuel demand will increase as the
economy sustains a recovery.  
 Business investment in the U.S., the world’s largest
economy, picked up in the second quarter. June orders for
durable goods, or non-military capital equipment excluding
aircraft, climbed 0.6 percent after jumping 4.6 percent in May,
more than previously reported, Commerce Department data
yesterday showed. Sales of such gear, used in calculating gross
domestic product, also rose.  
 The Commerce Department tomorrow may report the U.S.
economy expanded at a 2.5 percent annual pace from April through
June, compared with a 2.7 percent rate in the first three months
of the year, according to the median estimate from analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange rose as much as 44 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $76.50 a barrel. It was at $76.35 at 3:22 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract declined 7 cents to
settle at $76.06.
