             Asian  stocks  rose, driving the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index to the highest level in more than 10 weeks,
as a surge in earnings at Canon Inc. and China’s industrial
companies boosted confidence in the region’s corporate profits.  
 Canon , the world’s largest camera maker, surged 5.7 percent
in Tokyo as JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded the company after its
second-quarter profit quadrupled. Baoshan Iron & Steel Co.
gained 2.9 percent in Shanghai after China’s statistics bureau
reported a 72 percent surge in industrial companies’ first-half
earnings.  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. , the maker of Subaru cars,
climbed 6.8 percent on increased production.  
 “People are buying on optimism the global economy is on an
uptrend after seeing those positive earnings reports,” said
 Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $104 billion.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  climbed 1.1 percent to 119.36
as of 7:23 p.m. in Tokyo, the highest level since May 14. The
gauge has slumped 7.6 percent from its high this year on April
15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and Chinese steps to curb
property prices will slow global growth.  
 Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  climbed 2.7 percent as a
weaker yen boosted prospects for the country’s exports. China’s
Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.3 percent, extending gains from
its 2010 low to 11 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.6
percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.7 percent.  
 Futures on the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 lost 0.2 percent.
The gauge slipped 0.1 percent as a gauge of consumer confidence
retreated to a five-month low.  
 ‘Positive Surprise’  
 Canon  jumped 5.7 percent to 3,715 yen. Net income more than
quadrupled to 67.6 billion yen ($770 million) in the three
months ended June 30 from a year earlier, exceeding the median
analyst estimate of 58 billion yen in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “Canon’s result was a positive surprise,”  Hisashi Moriyama , a Tokyo-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote
in a report today. “Strong earnings had already been expected
but Canon showed an even bigger gain.” He raised the stock’s
rating to “overweight” from “neutral.”  
 Baoshan Steel, the listed unit of China’s second-biggest
steelmaker, added 2.9 percent to 6.41 yuan.  China Erzhong Group
Deyang Heavy Industries Co. , an equipment supplier to power
producers, gained 2.7 percent to 10.27 yuan.  
 Profits of Chinese industrial companies in 24 regions
jumped 72 percent to 1.61 trillion yuan ($237.5 billion) in the
first half of 2010 from a year earlier, the statistics bureau
said today in a statement on its website. The nation’s economic
fundamentals remain “good,” the People’s Bank of China said on
its website yesterday  
 Cement Producers  
 “A double-dip for China’s economy seems unlikely,” said
 Zhang Ling , a fund manager at Shanghai River Fund Management Co.
“The rebound will carry on for a while as stocks are cheap and
earnings of some companies have beaten expectations.”  
 Chinese cement producers rose after the Economic
Information Daily said China aims to eliminate inefficient
cement capacity and close polluting factories. Mergers and
consolidations among cement makers are set to accelerate,
according to the newspaper.  
 Anhui Conch Cement Co. , China’s biggest cement maker,
soared 10 percent to 19.58 yuan in Shanghai. China Resources
Cement Holdings Ltd. surged 6.5 percent to HK$3.77 in Hong Kong.  
 In Tokyo, Fuji Heavy Industries advanced 6.8 percent to 488
yen after reporting total production in June climbed 70 percent
from a year ago.  
 Lower Valuations  
 Speculation economic growth may falter dragged down the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index by as much as 9.6 percent this year,
cutting the  average  price of stocks in the gauge to the lowest
level since December 2008. The index’s companies now trade at
14.4 times estimated profit, compared with 13.4 times for the
 S&P 500 Index  and 12 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  
 The New York-based Conference Board reported yesterday that
its index of consumer confidence fell to 50.4 in July from a
revised 54.3 in June. The gauge was forecast to drop to 51,
according to economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Banks contributed the most to the gains in the  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index  on mounting speculation the relaxation of proposed
capital standards will ease financing needs.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s largest bank, gained 2.6
percent to HK$80.90 in Hong Kong, while London-based Standard
Chartered Plc rose 3.3 percent to HK$232.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s largest bank by market value,
climbed 3.6 percent to 433 yen.  
 Softer Rules  
 The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , which
represents central banks and regulators in 27 nations and sets
capital standards for banks worldwide, announced on July 26
softer capital rules proposed for lenders. The proposals were
welcomed by firms including Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG, which
yesterday reported better-than-estimated profit.  
 The Basel Committee was asked by Group of 20 leaders to
draft rules in the aftermath of the credit crisis. A gauge of
 finance stocks  in the MSCI World Index surged 1.7 percent
yesterday to a more than 10-week high.  
 “There has been positive response by investors overnight to
the updated paper” from the Basel Committee, RBS Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc analysts wrote in an e-mail today. “The
amendments are positive for the banking sector.”  
 Japanese exporters gained on optimism a weaker yen will
boost the value of overseas sales. Sony Corp. increased 2.7
percent to 2,608 yen.  Honda Motor Co. , which gets more than 80
percent of its sales abroad, gained 2.2 percent to 2,708 yen.
Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that counts North America as its
biggest market, jumped 3.6 percent to 657 yen.  
 Weaker Currency  
 The Japanese currency depreciated to 114.44 against the
euro today, compared with 113.17 at the close of stock trading
in Tokyo yesterday. Against the dollar, it weakened to 88.07
from 86.98. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  
 “The weaker yen spread a sense of security, since the
currency’s moves are what affect Japanese stocks the most,”
said  Masatsugu Okeya , a fund manager at Chiba-Gin Asset
Management Co. “Good news, including positive earnings results,
is drawing the attention of investors.”  
 Among shares that declined, Korean Air Lines Co., South
Korea’s largest carrier, slumped 5.1 percent to 74,000 won and
 EVA Airways Corp. , Taiwan’s second-largest air carrier, slid 2.5
percent to NT$19.60. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research cut its
recommendations on the two stocks to “underperform” from
“buy,” citing slowing cargo demand.  
 Hong Kong property developers fell after the  government 
sold a building site for HK$10.4 billion ($1.34 billion), lower
than the HK$10.5 billion median estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 Hang Lung Properties Ltd. , which reported lower-than-
estimated profit today, slumped 3.1 percent to HK$32.60. Sun
Hung Kai Properties Ltd., the world’s biggest developer by
market value, slipped 1.1 percent to HK$113.20.
