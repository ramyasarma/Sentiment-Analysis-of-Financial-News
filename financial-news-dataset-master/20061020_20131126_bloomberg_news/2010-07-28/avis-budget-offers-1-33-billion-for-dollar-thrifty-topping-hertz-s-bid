             Avis Budget Group Inc. ’s $1.33
billion offer for  Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. , which
topped  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. ’s agreement to buy the rental-
car company, may signal a bidding war has begun, analysts said.  
 The $46.50-a-share offer includes $39.25 in cash and 0.6543
of an Avis share for each Dollar Thrifty share, Parsippany, New
Jersey-based Avis said yesterday in a statement. The proposal is
4.5 percent less than Dollar Thrifty’s  closing price  yesterday.  
 Avis Chief Executive Officer  Ronald Nelson  is following
through on a May 3 letter in which he said he was interested in
making a “substantially higher” bid for Dollar Thrifty than
Hertz’s $1.2 billion offer. The proposal may draw higher bids
from both Hertz and Avis, said  Fred Lowrance , an analyst with
Avondale Partners LLC.  
 “Through an economic recovery and shrewd management
decisions, Dollar Thrifty has turned itself into a very valuable
asset,” Lowrance said yesterday in an interview from Nashville,
Tennessee. “Both of these companies know that, and they’re both
willing to pay more.”  
 Avis, in its offer letter yesterday, said Dollar Thrifty
should require Hertz to eliminate two provisions in its bid -- a
$44.6 million breakup fee and the right to match competing
offers -- in return for permission to continue making offers for
the company.  
 Hertz Offer  
 Hertz on April 26 offered $41 a share in cash and stock for
Dollar Thrifty to add to its namesake and Advantage brands and
extend its lead over Avis as the economic recovery spurred
travel. Dollar Thrifty said yesterday in a statement that it
received the Avis bid and will consider it.  
 Dollar Thrifty rose $1, or 2.1 percent, to $49.68 at 4:02
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . Avis gained
80 cents, or 7.2 percent, to $11.88. Hertz climbed 23 cents, or
2.1 percent, to $11.23.  
 Dollar Thrifty gained 25 percent through yesterday since
the day before Hertz’s offer was announced in April. The shares
traded for less than $1 as recently as March 2009.  
 Avis said the cash portion of its offer would be funded
with available cash and committed financing. The company on July
27 said it completed amendments to  credit  facilities that it
said would allow it to make an offer for Dollar Thrifty.  
 ‘Compelling Opportunity’  
 “We continue to believe that a combination with Avis
Budget presents a compelling opportunity for our respective
stakeholders and the prospect for your shareholders to obtain
the highest value for their investment,” Nelson said in a
letter to Dollar Thrifty’s  management  that was included in the
statement.  
 Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Dollar Thrifty has scheduled a
special meeting of its  stockholders  to vote on Hertz’s bid for
Sept. 16.  
 Investors in recent months have been betting on the final
offer price, said  John Healy , an analyst at Northcoast Research
Holdings in Cleveland.  
 “It’s just impossible to know where the line in the sand
is,” he said. “The only thing we do know is where will it be
accretive, and this asset will be accretive to both companies at
a purchase price into the mid-$50s.”  
 Richard Broome , a spokesman for Park Ridge, New Jersey-
based Hertz didn’t return a voicemail message seeking comment.  
 Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley are providing financial
advice to Avis, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Arnold & Porter LLP
are acting as legal counsel.  
 Barclays Plc and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch
advised Hertz on its April offer, with Debevoise & Plimpton LLP
and Jones Day providing legal advice. Dollar was advised by
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and law firm
Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.
