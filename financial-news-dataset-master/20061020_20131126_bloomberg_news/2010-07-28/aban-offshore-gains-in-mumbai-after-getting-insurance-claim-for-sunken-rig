             Aban Offshore Ltd. , India’s largest
oil-field equipment provider, was poised for its biggest gain in
almost 9 months after saying insurers had paid out most of a
claim for a rig that sank off Venezuela in May.  
 The  shares  climbed as much as 8.9 percent to 898.75 rupees,
heading for the biggest jump since Nov. 4, and traded at 891.55
rupees, up 8 percent, at 2:13 p.m. local time. The benchmark
 Sensitive Index  slipped 0.5 percent.  
 Aban Offshore fell the most in almost 18 years on May 14
after the sinking of the Aban Pearl natural gas platform leased
by a unit of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA. The company
had received 97 percent of its $235 million claim, it said in a
statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange today.  
 “The balance amount is likely to be received shortly,”
the Chennai-based company said.  
 PDVSA said a failure in Aban Pearl’s floatation system
caused the rig to sink on May 13 after a “massive” inflow of
water. The incident occurred three weeks after the Deepwater
Horizon oil rig, leased by BP Plc, exploded and later sank in
the Gulf of Mexico.
