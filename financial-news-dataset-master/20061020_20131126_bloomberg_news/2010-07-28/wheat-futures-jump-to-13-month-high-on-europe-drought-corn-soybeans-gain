             Wheat futures surged to a 13-month
high and corn and soybeans rose as drought damages crops in
Russia, Ukraine and other parts of Europe, increasing demand for
supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  
 Ukraine, the third-largest exporter of feed grains and
fifth-largest wheat shipper, may limit exports, Agriculture
Minister  Mykola Prysyazhnyuk  said today. In Russia, record high
temperatures may cut field-crop production 25 percent, Moscow-
based researcher SovEcon said yesterday. The price of European
milling wheat jumped as much as 5.1 percent today in Paris.  
 “There is rising anxiety among importers about global
shrinking supplies” said  Roy Huckabay , the executive vice
president of the Linn Group in Chicago. “We haven’t had a
global tender for wheat since last week, so no one knows the
current value of wheat.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery jumped 20.5 cents, or
3.4 percent, to close at $6.155 a bushel at 1:29 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $6.2325, the
highest level since June 12, 2009.  
 Corn futures for December delivery surged 13.75 cents, or
3.6 percent, to close at $3.9075 a bushel at 1:30 p.m. on the
CBOT, the biggest gain for the most-active contract since June
30. The commodity has gained 14 percent since June 29, the day
before the government said U.S. farmers planted less this year
than they had planned.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 12.5 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to close at $9.78 a bushel at 1:34 p.m. in
Chicago, the biggest gain since July 15. The most-active
contract has advanced 8.4 percent this month.  
 Grain output in Poland, the European Union’s largest
producer behind France and Germany, may slump 7 percent to 10
percent this year, to 25.1 million metric tons to 26.1 million
tons, because of smaller plantings and poor weather, the Warsaw-
based Central Statistical Office said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Asian buyers are looking to replace supplies usually
purchased from nations in Europe and the former Soviet Union,
Huckabay said. Wheat and feed-grain production may fall 11
percent to 163.4 million tons this year in the former Soviet
Union from 181.7 million last year, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said on July 9.  
 “U.S. corn is the cheapest feed grain for Asian buyers,”
Huckabay said.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government figures
show.
