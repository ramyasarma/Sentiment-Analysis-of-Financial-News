             Hog futures rose for the second
straight day on speculation that demand for U.S. pork is
outpacing the supply of animals to slaughterhouses. Cattle also
gained.  
 Wholesale pork  climbed to 86.86 cents a pound yesterday,
the highest level since June 1, according to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture. Meatpackers processed 1.16 million hogs in the
first three days of this week, 6.9 percent fewer than last year.
In June, the U.S. herd was 3.6 percent smaller than a year
earlier after two years of losses spurred farmers to cut supply.  
 “Demand is probably pretty good at this point, and I would
also assume that the relatively low slaughter we’ve seen this
week is inspiring some confidence,” said  Dan Vaught , the owner
of Vaught Futures Insights in Altus, Arkansas. “People are
thinking that the numbers available to the industry over the
short run will tend to be limited.”  
 Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.725 cent, or 1
percent, to close at 76.95 cents a pound at 1:08 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price has jumped 46 percent in
the past year as supplies shrank and demand recovered from the
recession.  
 In May, U.S. pork exports rose 18 percent to 362.8 million
pounds (164,600 metric tons) from a year earlier, according to
the most-recent USDA data.  
 Cattle Market  
 Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.275 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 94.2 cents a pound. The most-active contract is up
4.6 percent this month. Feeder-cattle futures for August
settlement dropped 0.25 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.1485 a
pound.  
 Packers processed 384,000 cattle in the first three days of
this week, down 0.5 percent from a week earlier, according to
the USDA.  Feedlots  bought 1.628 million young cattle last month,
fewer than analysts estimated, the USDA said July 23.  
 “Feedlot supplies are not at all overwhelming, and
producers have been moving cattle in a very timely manner,”
Vaught said. “Underlying beef demand is pretty good, but right
now seasonal concerns have limited the upside potential.”  
 Cattle futures earlier fell to the lowest price since July
15 on speculation that slowing beef shipments by meatpackers
signal U.S. demand is shrinking.  
 Yesterday, packers  shipped  2.77 million pounds of choice
beef, the lowest amount since July 2, USDA data show. Demand in
the U.S. tends to slacken in late July and early August as
temperatures peak and fewer people grill outdoors.  
 Beef “movement had been pretty good, but it slowed down a
little bit last week, and this week it hasn’t exactly been very
robust,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.
