             Copper rose to the highest price in
11 weeks on speculation that economic growth will be resilient
in China and the U.S., the world’s biggest metal users.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  of equities jumped to a two-
month high. U.S. orders and shipments for nonmilitary capital
goods excluding aircraft climbed 0.6 percent in June, the
Commerce Department said. Copper has gained 10 percent in July.  
 “People are thinking that the economy is not as bad as
they had feared,” said  Lannie Cohen , the president of Capitol
Commodity Services in Indianapolis. “China is still strong and
will support copper demand.”  
 Copper futures for September delivery gained 3.9 cents, or
1.2 percent, to close at $3.2455 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $3.265, the
highest level for a most-active contract since May 10.  
 “Growth in Asia is pretty powerful,” said  Dan Smith , an
analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in London. A rebound in the
U.S. “is only going to add to the recovery,” he said.  
 Copper  stockpiles  monitored by the London Metal Exchange
fell, extending a slump to the lowest level since Nov. 17.
Inventories have dropped 18 percent this year to 411,425 metric
tons, signaling steady demand.  
 On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose $111,
or 1.6 percent, to $7,170 a metric ton ($3.26 a pound).  
 Aluminum, tin, lead and zinc also gained in London. Nickel
fell.
