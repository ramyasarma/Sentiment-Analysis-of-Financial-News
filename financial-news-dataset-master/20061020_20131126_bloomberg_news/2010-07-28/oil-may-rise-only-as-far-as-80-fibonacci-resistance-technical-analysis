             Crude oil, which fell the most in
more than three weeks yesterday, remains in a rising channel on
technical charts and will continue to face resistance near $80 a
barrel, according to  Societe Generale SA .  
 Oil for September delivery in New York will be capped at
the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the contract’s drop in
May, said  Stephanie Aymes , a cross-commodity technical analyst
at France’s second-largest bank by market value. This is in a
band near $80.82 a barrel, where a rally from below $70 stalled
on June 21.  
 “As long as $80.45 to $80.85 remains resistance, the next
move will be on the downside,” Aymes said in an Instant
Bloomberg live-chat message. “Daily indicators are range-bound,
not far from resistances.”  
 Oil, down 3 percent so far in 2010, fell yesterday amid
concern a drop in  consumer confidence  in the U.S. indicated fuel
demand in the world’s largest economy would falter. September
futures were at $77.18 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, down 32 cents, or 0.4 percent, at 11
a.m. Singapore time.  
 Crude may be supported around $76.90 a barrel, the bottom
of the upward-trending channel going back about three weeks,
according to Societe Generale. If support is breached,
“consolidation” may take place at $75.60 to $76.15 and prices
may fall further to $74.35 to $74.70, Aymes said.  
 Oil’s decline yesterday came a day after a so-called Doji,
a formation that confirmed a bearish chart pattern. The Doji,
created when prices settle at the same level for two consecutive
days, was the first for New York crude since September.  
 The Fibonacci sequence, identified by Italian mathematician
Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century, is used by traders to
predict points of support and resistance as a market retraces
earlier movements.
