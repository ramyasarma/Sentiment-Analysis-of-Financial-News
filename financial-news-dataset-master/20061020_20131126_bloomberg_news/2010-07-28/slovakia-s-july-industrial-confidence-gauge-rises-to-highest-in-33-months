             Slovak  industrial confidence  rose to
its highest level in 33 months in July, reaching 7 from a
revised 3.7 in the previous month, as manufacturers expect
output to increase, the country’s Statistics  Office  said.  
 The  consumer confidence  indicator dropped to minus 17.8 in
July from minus 17.4 in the previous month as households became
more pessimistic about employment prospects and the economy in
general, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based office said on its
website today.  
 The indicators may range from minus 100 if all respondents
are pessimistic to 100 if they are all optimistic.
