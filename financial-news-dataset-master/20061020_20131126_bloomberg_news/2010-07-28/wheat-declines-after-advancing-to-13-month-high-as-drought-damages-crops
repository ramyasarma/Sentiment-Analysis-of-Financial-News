             Wheat futures in Chicago declined
after rising to a 13-month high yesterday as drought damages
crops in Russia, Ukraine and other parts of Europe.  
 The September-delivery contract fell as much as 0.4 percent
before trading down 0.1 percent at $6.1475 a bushel at 9:07 a.m.
Melbourne time. Corn futures gained 0.1 percent to $3.9125 and
soybeans for November delivery rose 0.1 percent to $9.79 a
bushel.
