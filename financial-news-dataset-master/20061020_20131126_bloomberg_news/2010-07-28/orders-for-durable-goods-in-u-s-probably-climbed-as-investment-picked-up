             Orders  for durable goods probably
increased in June for the sixth time in the past seven months,
showing business spending is supporting the U.S. recovery,
economists said before a report today.  
 Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years rose
1 percent after dropping 0.6 percent in May, according to the
median of 76  projections  in a Bloomberg News survey.  Excluding
transportation  gear, orders may have grown 0.4 percent.  
 Eaton Corp.  is among manufacturers benefitting from a
pickup in demand as companies in the U.S. and abroad update
equipment. The gains will compensate in part for a slowdown in
consumer spending that is causing the world’s largest economy to
cool heading into the second half of the year.  
 “Business spending, particularly for capital equipment, is
holding up,” said  Ken Mayland , president of ClearView Economics
LLC in Pepper Pike, Ohio. “Ordering is strong as companies ramp
up and resupply.”  
 The Commerce Department’s report is due at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington. Survey estimates ranged from a drop of 1 percent to
an increase of 4 percent. Projections for bookings excluding
transportation  ranged  from a decline of 1.5 percent to a 1
percent gain.  
 Eaton, the Cleveland-based maker of engine valves and
transmissions, last week boosted its profit projections for 2010
on rising demand for truck parts and hydraulic systems.  
 ‘Better’ Year  
 “This year is shaping up to be better than we had
forecast,” Chief Executive Officer  Sandy Cutler  said in a July
21 statement.  
 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles
Plosser said July 26 that there is fundamental strength in the
economy. The Fed will release at 2 p.m. today its Beige Book
survey of business in each of the central bank’s 12 regions.  
 “I think there is underlying strength there that is still
there,” Plosser said in an interview with Bloomberg Television
in Washington.  
 Manufacturing shares are outperforming the broader market.
The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Machinery  Index , which
includes Eaton and Moline, Illinois-based Deere & Co. is up 14
percent so far this year. The broader S&P 500  Index  is down 0.1
percent.  
 A jump in aircraft orders may have boosted durable-goods
bookings.  Boeing Co. , the world’s second-biggest commercial-
plane maker, said it received 49 orders last month, compared
with 5 in May. Industry data may not correlate with the
government statistics on a month-to-month basis.  
 Exports Jump  
 Growing demand from overseas is also helping American
factories.  Exports  climbed 21 percent in the 12 months ended
May, the biggest year-over-year gain since comparable records
began in 1992, according to Commerce Department data.  
 A cheaper  dollar  is restoring the competitiveness of
American products abroad, contributing to higher sales. After
gaining 17 cents against the euro from mid April to early June
on mounting concern over the European debt crisis, the dollar
has retreated about 11 cents since June 7 on growing signs the
continent is weathering the turmoil.  
 Recent reports showed Europe’s service and manufacturing
industries unexpectedly accelerated in July, German business
confidence surged to a three-year high and the British economy
grew in the second quarter at the fastest pace in four years.  
 A Commerce Department report in two days may show the U.S.
economy grew at a 2.5 percent annual pace from April through
June compared with a 2.7 percent rate in the first three months
of the year, according to the median estimate of analysts
surveyed. Consumer spending rose 2.4 percent after a 3 percent
first-quarter gain, the survey showed.
