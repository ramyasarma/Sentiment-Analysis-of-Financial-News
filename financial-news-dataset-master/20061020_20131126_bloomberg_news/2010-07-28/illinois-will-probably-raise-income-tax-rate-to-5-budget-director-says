             Illinois, which is in its worst
financial position ever, will raise the income-tax rate in
January to address its deficit, Governor Pat Quinn’s budget
director said.  
 Lawmakers will likely increase the personal tax to 5
percent from 3 percent, generating $6 billion of new revenue,
the budget director, David Vaught, said in an interview. The
legislature failed to address the deficit this year because of
the pending November election, he said.  
 “We’re going to pass a tax increase in January,” Vaught
said. “We expect it is going to be substantial.”
