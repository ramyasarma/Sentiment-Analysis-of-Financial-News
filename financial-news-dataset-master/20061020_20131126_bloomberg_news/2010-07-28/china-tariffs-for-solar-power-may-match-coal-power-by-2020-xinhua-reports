             China, the world’s biggest energy
consumer, may make solar power as cheap as electricity produced
from coal in about a decade as the country accelerates the
development of cleaner energy to cut emissions.  
 The country’s solar-power tariffs may fall to between 0.6
yuan (9 cents) and 0.8 yuan a kilowatt-hour by 2020 as China
expands its capacity to generate electricity from sunlight by
about fourfold to 20 gigawatts from 2015 levels, the official
Xinhua News Agency  reported , citing Liu Qi, a deputy director at
the National Energy Administration.  
 China may spend about 5 trillion yuan in the next decade
developing cleaner energy sources, Jiang Bing, head of the
National Energy Administration’s planning and development
department, said on July 20. Solar projects in China are
approaching “grid parity” where clean power costs are similar
to those for fossil fuels,  Anil Srivastava , executive president
for renewable energy at Areva SA, said in June.  
 Shandong province has set an electricity purchase price of
1.7 yuan a kilowatt-hour for photovoltaic power plants for 2010,
according to a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report on July 5,
citing the local government. Prices nationwide may average below
1 yuan by 2015, Liu was quoted as saying in the Xinhua report.
