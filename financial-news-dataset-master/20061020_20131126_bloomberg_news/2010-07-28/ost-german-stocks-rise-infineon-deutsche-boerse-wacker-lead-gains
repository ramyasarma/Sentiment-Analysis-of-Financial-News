             German stocks  retreated for the
first time in six days after a report showed U.S. durable goods
orders unexpectedly fell in June, adding to evidence the
economic recovery has slowed down.  
 BASF SE  led falling shares, declining 1.7 percent. Infineon
Technologies AG, Europe’s second-largest chipmaker, climbed 2.6
percent after raising its fiscal 2010 forecast for a third time.
 Deutsche Boerse AG  gained for a third consecutive day.  
 The benchmark  DAX  Index dropped 0.5 percent to 6,178.94 at
close of trading as of 5:30 p.m. in Frankfurt. The measure has
fallen 2.4 percent from this year’s high on April 26 amid
concern that the economic recovery is losing steam as indebted
European governments slash spending and China takes steps to
cool its economy. The broader HDAX Index lost 0.5 percent today.  
 Total orders for durable goods, products meant to last at
least three years, unexpectedly dropped 1 percent in June,
Commerce Department figures showed. Economists forecast orders
would climb 1 percent, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “This is a weak report that is underlining the view that
the economy hit a pothole in the summer months,” said Bernd Weidensteiner , Frankfurt-based U.S. economist at Commerzbank AG.
“Firms overall prefer to stay on the sidelines.”  
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the world’s biggest maker of
luxury cars, slumped 1.9 percent to 40.72 euros.  
 Chemicals Maker Drops  
 BASF , the world’s largest chemicals maker, dropped 1.7
percent to 45.33 euros, while Bayer slid 1 percent to 44.20
euros. European chemicals shares were among the worst performers
in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  
 Continental AG , Europe’s second-biggest car-parts maker,
slumped 1.3 percent to 48.65 euros. Schaeffler Group,
Continental’s majority shareholder, may begin a merger of the
two companies at the end of next year that will keep all units
intact, Chief Executive Officer Juergen Geissinger said.  
 “We’ll be ready for it in late 2011,” Geissinger told
reporters in Munich last night. “At this time, there are no
considerations that any of our divisions would not be part” of
a joint company, he added.  
 Aixtron AG  fell 2.6 percent to 24.32 euros as the maker of
equipment used to produce LED screens was downgraded to “sell”
from “hold” at Hauck & Aufhaeuser KGaA.  
 Wincor Nixdorf AG  dropped 1.5 percent to 46.50 euros as the
world’s second-largest maker of automated teller machines said
its nine-month net income fell 8 percent to 80 million euros
($104 million), as net sales declined.  
 Metro AG , Germany’s largest retailer, lost 2.6 percent to
41.38 euros.  
 Infineon Beats Estimates  
 Infineon  surged 2.6 percent to 5.18 euros. The company,
which today reported fiscal third-quarter net income that beat
analysts’ estimates, said that sales growth this year will be a
“mid-to-high 40s percentage.” Sales fell 22 percent last year
to 3 billion euros as companies put spending on hold and
consumer demand dropped. The forecast assumes an exchange rate
of $1.3 to the euro.  
 “We have come a long way in improving profitability,”
Chief Executive Officer Peter Bauer said in today’s statement.  
 Deutsche Boerse , the operator of the Frankfurt exchange,
increased 4 percent to 54.06 euros. Second-quarter net income
fell to 160.8 million euros from 164.9 million euros in the
year-ago period, the exchange said. That’s higher than the 154.7
million-euro average of six analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The company took a charge of 82 million euros for
previously announced job cuts.
