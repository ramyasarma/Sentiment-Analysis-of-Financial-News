             Wheat rose on speculation that
Russia and Ukraine may introduce export controls to contain
domestic prices after adverse weather cut production.  
 Milling wheat for November delivery gained as much as 3.9
percent to 187.75 euros ($244.11) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in
Paris and was at 186 euros at 1:25 p.m. local time. September-
delivery wheat climbed as much as 2.1 percent in Chicago.  
 Ukraine has yet to introduce milling-wheat export limits
and will “look into the issue” if shipments increase,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said today. Russian
grain traders may hesitate to sign new export agreements on
concern that a local drought may spur the government to curb
outbound shipments, researcher SovEcon said last week.  
 “Analysts have raised the possibility of export
restrictions in Russia and Ukraine as a result of the drought,”
Paris-based farm adviser  Agritel  said in a market comment today.
“For the moment, these rumors remain in the realm of
hypothesis.”  
 Russia will harvest as little as 75 million tons of grain
this year after record heat in the country’s center, below a
July 19 outlook for no more than 81.5 million tons, the Russian
Grain Union said yesterday. The wheat crop may fall to 45
million tons from 62 million in 2009, it said.  
 Exports From Ukraine  
 Adverse conditions in Russia “should prompt the USDA to
clearly adjust Black Sea wheat production down in its next
report,” Agritel said, referring to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.  
 Ukrainian grain exports may be 16 million to 16.5 million
tons this season, Prysyazhnyuk said. They were 21.2 million tons
in the prior period, the Ukrainian Agrarian Confederation said
last week. Rain slowed grain harvesting this year, Kiev-based
consultant UkrAgroConsult said this month.  
 Wheat rose 1.9 percent to $6.065 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade, paring a climb as high as $6.0725.  
 December-delivery corn added 1.1 percent to $3.8125 a
bushel. The most-active contract touched $3.7575 on July 26, the
lowest level since July 1, on speculation rain will help crop
yields in the U.S., the biggest grower and exporter.  
 About 72 percent of the U.S. corn crop was rated good or
excellent as of July 25, while 67 percent of soybeans got the
top ratings, the USDA said July 26. The ratings were unchanged
from a week earlier.  
 Rabobank Forecast  
 Corn will average $4.25 a bushel in the first quarter of
2011,  Luke Chandler , Rabobank’s executive director of
agricultural market research, said this week. Prices also may
rise because U.S. supplies are cheaper for importers in China,
Chandler said.  
 Soybeans for November delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$9.7075 a bushel. Farmers in Brazil, the world’s second-biggest
producer, may increase planting of the oilseed this year as
prices rise and fertilizer costs drop, a farm group said.  
 Planting may rise in Mato Grosso and Rio Grande do Sul
states for next year’s crop, which farmers will start planting
in September, the National Confederation of Agriculture and
Cattle said yesterday. Fertilizer prices may drop 10 to 15
percent, the group said.
