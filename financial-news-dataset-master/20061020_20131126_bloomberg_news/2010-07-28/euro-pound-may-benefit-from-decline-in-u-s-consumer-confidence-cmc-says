             The euro and pound may strengthen
following a drop in U.S. consumer confidence, CMC Markets said.  
 The decline “could play further into the yield
differential story, to the benefit of the euro and pound as the
3.05 percent cap in U.S. bond yields works to the relative
advantage of non-dollar foreign exchange,”  Ashraf Laidi , chief
market strategist at CMC in London, wrote in a note yesterday.
“U.K. and German bond yields have extended their run-up.”  
 The Conference Board’s sentiment index fell to 50.4, below
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg and
the lowest level in five months, figures from the New York-based
private research group showed yesterday.  
 The euro climbed 0.2 percent to $1.3024 as of 8:27 a.m. in
London while the pound was little changed at $1.5590.
