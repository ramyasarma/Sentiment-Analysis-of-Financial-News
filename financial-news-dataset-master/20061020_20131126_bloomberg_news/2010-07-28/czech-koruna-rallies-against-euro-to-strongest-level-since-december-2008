             The Czech koruna extended its rally
to the strongest level against the euro since November 2008,
boosted by automatic purchase orders from investors who
previously bet on the koruna weakening.  
 The koruna jumped as much as 1.3 percent to 24.719 per euro
and traded up 1.2 percent at 24.730 as of 5:53 p.m. in Prague,
the best performance among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It’s been the world’s best
performer in July, having gained 3.7 percent against the euro.  
 Automatic purchase orders were generated after the koruna
breached its strongest level in 2009, said analyst  Jan Vejmelek 
at Komercni Banka AS in Prague. The koruna last broke through 25
per euro on Sept. 17, when it reached 24.983 per euro, according
to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “The koruna broke loose because of automatic stop-loss
orders that sent the currency toward the next technical support
levels at 24.84 and 24.68” per euro, said Vejmelek.
