             Arabica coffee prices in Brazil, the
world’s biggest grower of the commodity, will stay near a five-
year high as rising demand outpaces supply, according to a
research group.  
 Growers will sell coffee harvested from April to September
for 300 reais to 310 reais ($170 to $176) a bag, said  Fernanda Geraldini , an analyst at the University of Sao Paulo’s Cepea
research unit. Coffee in Minas Gerais state, the biggest
producer in Brazil,  rose  to 313.07 reais on June 24, the highest
since March 2005, according to Cepea data.  
 Rising global demand will top output this year and be
enough to absorb the increase in supplies as a bumper Brazilian
crop hits the market, Geraldini said. Coffee futures in New York
fell the most in a week yesterday on concern that the bigger
Brazilian harvest would spur sales.  
 “The supply of good quality coffee is very small, so
prices will stay high even after bigger volumes enter the market
in August,” Geraldini said yesterday in a telephone interview
from Piracicaba, Brazil.  
 Brazilian output is forecast to increase 23 percent to a
record 55.3 million bags this year as crops enter the more-
productive phase of a biennial cycle, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said June 18.  
 Arabica Competition  
 Price increases “won’t last long” as other countries,
such as Vietnam, will start growing Arabica to seek a profit,
Deputy Agriculture Minister  Gerardo Fontelles  said today in an
interview in Brasilia. He declined to say when prices may drop.  
 Brazil postponed plans to buy 5 million coffee bags this
year after prices rose, Fontelles said on July 6. Growers are
pushing the government to boost purchases to help bolster the
price as they struggle with about 4 billion reais in debt,
according to the agriculture confederation.  
 Last year, Brazil offered to buy 3 million bags in options
contracts.  
 Growers have to produce beans in Brazil for a maximum of
260 reais a bag to make a profit, Fontelles said.  
 One bag weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery rose 3.75 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $1.675 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 1:42 p.m.
in New York, after dropping yesterday the most since July 20.
The commodity has declined 5.3 percent since reaching a 12-year
high of $1.765 on June 24.
