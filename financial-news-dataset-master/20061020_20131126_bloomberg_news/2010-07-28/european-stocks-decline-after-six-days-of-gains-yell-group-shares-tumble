             European stocks declined, halting
six-days of gains, led by a selloff in Yell Group Plc. U.S.
index futures also retreated.  
 The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.4 percent
to 257.15 at 11:24 a.m. in London after earlier rallying as much
as 0.6 percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring in September declined 0.2 percent.  
 Yell Group dropped 14 percent to 26.09 pence, the biggest
decline on the Stoxx 600. The maker of microchips used in Nokia
Oyj mobile phones said it sees “growing caution in the
macroeconomic outlook” for the second half of 2010.
