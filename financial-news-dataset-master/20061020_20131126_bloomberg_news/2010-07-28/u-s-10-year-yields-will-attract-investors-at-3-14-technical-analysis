             Treasury  10-year notes may attract
investors as their yields rise to 3.14 percent, National
Australia Bank Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  
 A Fibonacci graph shows the level is a 50 percent
retracement of a decline in  yield  that began at 3.42 percent on
June 3 and ended at 2.85 percent July 21. The levels identified
by Fibonacci charts help investors to set buy and sell orders.  
 “That’s a pretty important resistance level,” said  Peter Jolly , Sydney-based head of market research for the investment-
banking unit of National Australia Bank, the nation’s largest
lender. “To break that technical level, we’re going to need to
see data that is supportive for the economy.”  
 Ten-year rates declined one basis point today to 3.04
percent as of 6:50 a.m. in London. They have fluctuated around
the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of 3.07 percent for
a month. Yields climbed toward the 50 percent barrier once in
July, stopping short at 3.13 percent on July 14.  
 Colin Embree , head of fixed income trading and sales at
Bank of Nova Scotia Asia Ltd. in Singapore, said he’s betting
10-year yields will stay below 3.15 percent. He said he’s
considering buying as rates rise.  
 Fibonacci  analysis is based on a formula developed by 13th
century Italian mathematician Leonardo da Pisa, known as
Fibonacci, who discovered the sequence while studying the
reproduction rate of rabbits.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
