             Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  won
a confidence vote to accelerate passage of austerity measures to
trim Italy’s budget deficit.  
 The Chamber of Deputies voted 329 to 275 today to approve
25 billion euros ($32.6 billion) in deficit cuts for the next
two years as part of an effort to shore up confidence in the
euro region after Greece’s near-default.  
 Berlusconi, whose popularity is at its lowest since coming
to power, staked his Cabinet’s survival on the outcome of the
ballot to avoid voting on each proposed amendment. The budget
cuts aim to bring last year’s deficit of 5.3 percent of gross
domestic product within the EU limit of 3 percent in 2012. The
government is seeking 12.5 billion euros a year in savings.  
 The measures, less severe than those adopted in Spain and
Greece, have angered Berlusconi allies in regional governments.
The plan will cut their funding by 4.5 billion euros next year,
prompting some local administrations to raise taxes and tolls
and consider asset sales to close budget gaps.  
 About 5 billion euros will come from a three-year freeze on
public salaries and limiting hiring in the next two years. Other
steps include salary cuts for the highest-paid members of the
public administration, and fighting tax evasion.
