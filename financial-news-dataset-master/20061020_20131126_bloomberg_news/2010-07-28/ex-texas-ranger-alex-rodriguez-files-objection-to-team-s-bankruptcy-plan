             Alex Rodriguez , third baseman for
the New York Yankees, objected to the bankruptcy plan of his
former baseball team, the Texas Rangers, which owes him
$24.9 million in deferred compensation.  
 The plan doesn’t make clear whether Rodriguez’s contract
will be assumed by the buyer of the baseball team “with all of
his rights remaining intact,” his lawyer said in a filing today
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Fort Worth, Texas.  
 The objection to the Rangers’ bankruptcy plan was one of
several filed today. Besides Rodriguez, the team’s lenders,
Major League Baseball, the Major League Baseball Players
Association, and the U.S. government’s bankruptcy watchdog filed
objections about the plan.  
 The objections come as the Rangers are scheduled to go up
for auction next week. A group led by attorney  Chuck Greenberg 
and Hall of Fame pitcher  Nolan Ryan  has an agreement to buy the
team subject to higher bids. Initial bids are due on Aug. 3.  
 Mark Semer , a spokesman for the Rangers, declined to
comment about the objections.  
 The lenders, led by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , oppose the
Greenberg-Ryan deal and the auction process, which they say will
chill bidding and doesn’t give interested buyers enough time to
put together their best bids.  
 The lenders repeated those arguments in their court filing
and objected to what they said were illegal liability releases
in the plan.  
 ‘Unwavering Rush’  
 “The Greenberg group’s unwavering rush to a confirmation
hearing -- like a shopper who grabs a mistakenly underpriced
item and runs to the cash register before someone realizes the
error -- makes it practically impossible to hold a fair auction
of the Texas Rangers,” the lenders said.  
 In his objection, Rodriguez said he hasn’t received
assurance from the Rangers or those bidding for the team that he
will be paid on his former contract with the team. Rodriguez,
who is one home run away from hitting his milestone 600th home
run, was traded to the Yankees from Texas in 2004.  
 The committee of unsecured creditors said in an objection
that it also hasn’t received assurance that the successful
bidder for the team will have the financial ability to satisfy
the club’s obligations. The new owner will assume about
$204 million in liabilities, including player contracts and
deferred compensation agreements, according to the filing.  
 The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners,
10-43400, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas
(Fort Worth).
