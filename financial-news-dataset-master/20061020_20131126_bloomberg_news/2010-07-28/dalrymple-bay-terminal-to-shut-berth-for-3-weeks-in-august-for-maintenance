             Australia’s Dalrymple Bay, one of
two terminals at the world’s biggest export harbor for coal,
will shut a berth at the facility in August for more than three
weeks for planned maintenance.  
 Berth 1 will be closed from Aug. 2 to Aug. 28 while work is
conducted on a shiploader,  Greg Smith , general manager of
operations, said by telephone. Berth 2 will resume loading
vessels today after maintenance, he said.  
 Hay Point port, which includes a terminal operated by BHP
Billiton-Mitsubishi Alliance, is about 1,000 kilometers (620
miles) north of Brisbane in Queensland state and has the
capacity to export 129 million metric tons of coal a year. Three
of four berths at Dalrymple Bay will be loading vessels during
the August maintenance, Smith said.  
 BHP Billiton-Mitsubishi Alliance, or BMA, shut one of two
berths at its Hay Point terminal on July 7 for planned
maintenance. The closure will last until Aug. 10, BHP Billiton
Ltd. spokeswoman  Fiona Martin  said this month.  
 Dalrymple Bay has the capacity to export 85 million tons
and about 80 percent of the coal shipped is used for steelmaking.
BMA’s Hay Point terminal has an export capacity of 44 million
tons of steelmaking coal a year.
