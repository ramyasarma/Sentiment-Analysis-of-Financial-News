             Khazanah Nasional Bhd ., Malaysia’s
state investment company, hired three banks to help it sell
Singapore dollar-denominated Islamic bonds, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  
 CIMB Investment Bank Bhd., DBS Bank Ltd. and Oversea-
Chinese Banking Corp. will arrange a so-called benchmark sale of
five- and 10-year sukuk, the person said, asking not to be
identified as the details are private. Benchmark typically means
at least S$500 million ($366 million).  
 Khazanah offered S$3.5 billion on July 26 for the shares in
Singapore’s  Parkway Holdings Ltd . that it doesn’t already own,
topping a bid from India’s Fortis Healthcare Ltd. The Kuala
Lumpur-based group tendered S$3.95 a share in cash for 76.1
percent of Parkway to gain Asia’s biggest hospital operator.  
 Khazanah started talks with five banks this month for loans
that would help it increase its offer for Parkway, three people
with knowledge of the matter said on July 7.  
 Shares in Parkway were trading down 1 Singapore cent at
S$3.92 as of 1:30 p.m. in Singapore. Islamic bonds, or sukuk,
use asset returns to pay investors in compliance with Islam’s
ban on interest.
