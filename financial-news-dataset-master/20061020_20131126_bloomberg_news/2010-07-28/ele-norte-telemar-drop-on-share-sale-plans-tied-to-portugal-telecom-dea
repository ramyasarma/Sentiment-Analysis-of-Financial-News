             Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA 
and  Telemar Norte Leste SA  tumbled more than 8 percent after
saying they will each sell 12 billion reais ($6.78 billion) in
stock to existing shareholders as part of the  Portugal Telecom
SGPS SA  agreement to buy a stake in  Telemar .  
 Telemar, Brazil’s biggest fixed-line telephone company
known as Oi, sank 8.6 percent to 48.01 reais, the most since
December 2008. Tele Norte Leste’s preferred, or non-voting
shares, dropped 11 percent to 27.17 reais, the steepest retreat
since April 19. Voting shares for Tele Norte, Telemar’s parent
company, plunged 16 percent to 35.20 reais, the biggest decline
since December 2006.  
 “The capital increases are huge and the overhang may
weight on the stocks at first,” Banco BTG Pactual SA said in an
e-mail to clients.  
 Tele Norte plans to raise 12 billion reais by selling
common shares for 38.55 reais and preferred, or non-voting,
stock for 28.26 reais to existing shareholders, according to a
regulatory filing. Telemar will also offer existing shareholders
12 billion reais in stock, selling common shares for 63.70 reais
and preferred for 50.70 reais each.  
 The stocks are falling on concern the share sale will
dilute earnings per share for investors, said  Rosangela Ribeiro ,
an analyst at SLW Corretora in Sao Paulo.  
 ‘Dilution, Surprise’  
 “There’s dilution, and the market didn’t like it,”
Ribeiro said in a telephone interview. “This took people by
surprise.”  
 Portugal Telecom will pay a maximum 8.4 billion reais ($4.8
billion) for indirect and direct stakes equivalent to 22.4
percent of Oi, as Telemar is known, the companies said today in
regulatory filings. Telemar also plans to acquire 10 percent of
Portugal Telecom, replacing Telefonica SA as the Portuguese
company’s biggest investor.  
 The Oi deal came as Portugal Telecom agreed to sell its
stake in a venture controlling Brazil’s largest wireless
operator,  Vivo Participacoes SA , to its Spanish partner.
 Telefonica  agreed to buy out the Lisbon-based company’s stake
for 7.5 billion euros ($9.7 billion) after it had raised its bid
three times. Vivo shares added 4 percent to 48.15 reais today.  
 Oi provides Internet access, mobile, fixed-line and pay-
television services. It had a record first-quarter  profit  after
acquiring its smaller rival Brasil Telecom SA in 2009. The Rio
de Janeiro-based company had a 20.1 percent share of the
country’s wireless market in June, while market leader Vivo had
30.2 percent, according to Brazil’s telecommunications
regulator.  
 Telemar Norte Leste’s parent company is  Tele Norte Leste
Participacoes SA , which in turn is controlled by closely held
Telemar Participacoes.
