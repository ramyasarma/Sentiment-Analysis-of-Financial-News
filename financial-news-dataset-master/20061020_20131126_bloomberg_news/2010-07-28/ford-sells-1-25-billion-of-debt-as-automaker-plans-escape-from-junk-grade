             Ford Motor Co. , last year’s biggest
issuer of high-yield corporate debt, sold $1.25 billion in
seven-year notes a day after yields on its similar-maturity
company debt fell to the lowest on record.  
 The second-largest U.S. automaker issued the 6.625 percent
notes at a yield of 6.9 percent through its Ford Motor Credit
Co. unit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Ford sold the securities less than a week after reporting
its biggest first-half profit in 12 years and debt reductions
aimed at restoring the investment-grade ratings it lost in 2005.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based company raised the debt as yields
on speculative-grade bonds fell to the lowest in more than two
months, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  
 “They’ve been very smart about when they issue,” said
 Kathleen Gaffney , co-manager of the $18.6 billion  Loomis Sayles
Bond Fund , which has outperformed 96 percent of its peers in the
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “They’re
showing really high-quality management there.”  
 Yields on Ford’s $1.5 billion of 8 percent notes due in
2016 fell yesterday to 6.56 percent, the lowest since they were
issued in 2006, as the price rose to 107.375 cents on the
dollar, according to Trace, the bond price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  
 The bonds fell 0.375 cent to 107 cents on the dollar to
yield 6.63 percent, or 4.9 percentage points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, as of 2:09 p.m. in New York, Trace data
show. Yields have fallen from about 28 percent in October 2008.  
 Taurus Sedans  
 Moody’s Investors Service rates Ford Motor Credit’s
unsecured debt Ba3 and Standard & Poor’s grades the company
three steps lower at B-.  
 Ford, which earned $4.7 billion in the year’s first six
months, its largest first-half profit since 1998, said July 23
it planned to regain its investment-grade rankings.  
 The only major U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy last year
has been gaining market share in the U.S. with redesigned models
such as the Fusion and Taurus sedans. Ford controlled 17.5
percent of the U.S. auto market in the first half, up from 16.1
percent last year, according to researcher Autodata of Woodcliff
Lake, New Jersey.  
 High-yield, high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
and BBB- by S&P. Yields on the debt fell to 8.543 yesterday, the
lowest since May 5, when they were 8.45 percent, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show.  
 Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas, Citigroup Inc. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managed the sale, Ford said in a
prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
that didn’t specify the size or timing of the offering.  
 Ford Motor Credit plans to sell $4 billion to $6 billion in
unsecured debt this year, the company said on July 23. It last
tapped the corporate bond market in April, when it sold $1.75
billion of five-year, 7 percent notes, and has sold $4.5 billion
including today’s sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It issued $4.6 billion of bonds last year, Bloomberg data show.  
 General Motors Co. is the biggest U.S. automaker.
