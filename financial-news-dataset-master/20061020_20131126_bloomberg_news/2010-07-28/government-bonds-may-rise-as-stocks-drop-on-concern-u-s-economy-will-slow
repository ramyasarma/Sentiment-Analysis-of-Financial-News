             Japan’s 20-year bonds advanced on
speculation economic growth will decelerate, spurring demand for
the relative safety of government debt.  
 Benchmark  bond  futures climbed toward the highest level in
seven years before a report tomorrow forecast to show Japan’s
industrial production grew at the slowest pace in more than a
year last quarter. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.6 percent
in Tokyo after the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book business survey
said growth was slowing in some areas of the U.S.  
 “The bond market is close to a bubble,” said  Ayako Sera ,
a strategist in Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which
manages the equivalent of $310 billion. “Everybody is scared,
but there’s a game of chicken going on here.”  
 The yield on the 20-year bond declined 1.5 basis points to
1.76 percent as of 3:58 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.8 percent
security due June 2030 gained 0.222 yen to 100.589 yen. The
 yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond fell one basis point to 1.08
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery rose 0.17 to
141.72 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Futures
climbed to 142.08 on July 22, a level not seen since August 2003.  
 Japan’s factory  output  rose 0.2 percent in June from May,
according to the median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before the Trade Ministry report tomorrow. That
would cap the smallest quarterly gain since production fell in
the first three months of 2009.  
 U.S. Data  
 Bonds also gained after the U.S. Commerce Department said
yesterday orders for  durable goods  dropped 1 percent in June.
Economists had estimated a 1 percent increase. U.S. economic
growth slowed in some areas over the past two months, dragged
down by commercial real estate and the expiration of a tax
credit for homebuyers, the Fed said yesterday in its survey.  
 The U.S. was Japan’s second-biggest export market after
China by the value of products shipped during the first half of
2010, according to a Ministry of Finance  report .  
 Gains in bonds were limited as a Trade Ministry report
showed Japan’s  retail sales  growth improved in June.
1111  
 Retail sales increased 3.2 percent from a year earlier, the
sixth straight gain, led by demand for cars, gasoline and
clothes, the Trade Ministry said. The result matched the median
estimate of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
