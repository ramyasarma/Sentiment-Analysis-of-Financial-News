             Crude oil rose for the first time in
four days as European equity markets climbed to a 12-week high,
restoring optimism that fuel consumption will recover.  
 A U.S. Energy Department report today may show oil
inventories dropped to a four-month low, falling by 1.73 million
barrels from 353.5 million, based on the median estimate of 16
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
rose 0.4 percent to 259.1 at 9 a.m. in London, the highest level
since May 3.  
 “It’s a mix of the reporting season and macroeconomic
indicators that is driving the market,” said Thina Saltvedt, a
commodities analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Oslo. “Some companies
are reporting good second-quarter results, and that’s improving
risk appetite. The oil market is still improving, but it’s going
slowly.”  
 Crude for September delivery was at $77.59 a barrel, 9
cents higher, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 10:35 a.m. London time. The contract earlier dropped
as much as 62 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $76.88. Brent crude for
September settlement on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
traded at $76.23.
