             Qatar  stocks  rose for a third day,
led by  Industries Qatar  and  Commercial Bank of Qatar , as
European stocks rallied on improving earnings and oil advanced
for the first time this week.  
 Industries Qatar, the second-biggest petrochemicals maker
in the Middle East, climbed to the highest in a month after
Securities & Investment raised its share recommendation.
Commercial Bank, which reported a 23 percent profit increase
earlier this week, rose to the highest since May. The  QE Index 
gained 0.2 percent to 7,029.45 at the close, bringing the
monthly advance to 1.9 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index 
added 0.3 percent.  
 “The earnings announced so far are considered another
positive reason for traders to start building up positions at
current market prices,” said  Mohamed Abu Ghoush , head of equity
brokerage at Al-Ahli Bank in Doha.  
 Qatar National Bank SAQ  , the country’s biggest lender by
assets, said on July 6 second-quarter profit rose 36 percent.
The QE Index’s gain in July, the biggest monthly increase since
March, has left the 20 companies in the benchmark gauge valued
at 11.3 times reported earnings. That compares with 15.7 for the
regional Bloomberg GCC 200.  
 European stocks rose as improving earnings from Telefonica
SA to Cap Gemini SA outweighed a Federal Reserve report that
showed growth slowed in some areas of the economy. U.S. index
futures gained. Crude oil advanced 0.3 percent to $77.25 a
barrel at 2:05 in Doha today.  
 May 20  
 Industries Qatar increased 0.9 percent to 99.8 riyals, the
highest since June 28. Securities & Investment raised the shares
to “buy” from “add” with a six-month share-price estimate of
129 riyals.  
 Commercial Bank gained 1.2 percent to 70.3 riyals, the
highest since May 20. The country’s second-biggest lender by
assets beat analysts’ estimates as it reported second-quarter
net income of 408 million riyals ($112 million) on July 27.  
 Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  increased 0.5 percent and Bahrain’s
gauge rose 0.2 percent. The  Dubai Financial Market General Index 
and Abu Dhabi’s measure lost less than 0.1 percent, while
Kuwait’s  SE Price Index  retreated 0.2 percent. Saudi Arabia’s
market was closed for the weekend.
