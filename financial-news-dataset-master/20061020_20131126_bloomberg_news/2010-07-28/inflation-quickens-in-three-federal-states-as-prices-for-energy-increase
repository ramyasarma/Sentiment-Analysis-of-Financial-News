             Inflation in three German states
accelerated in July after energy prices rose.  
 In Brandenburg the inflation rate increased to 1.1 percent
from 0.8 percent in June, in Hesse it rose to 0.9 percent from
0.5 percent and in Saxony to 1.2 percent from 1 percent, the
states’ statistics offices said today.  
 Economists predict  German inflation , calculated using a
harmonized European method, will quicken to 1.1 percent from 0.8
percent, according to a median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg
News  survey . That report, based on reports from six states, is
due later today.  
 Crude oil prices are 15 percent higher than a year ago,
nudging inflation just as a weaker euro pushes up the cost of
imported goods. In June, import prices jumped an annual 9.1
percent, the most in a decade. At the same, uncertainty about
the economic outlook and concerns about Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis may weigh on consumer demand, limiting companies’ ability
to raise prices.  
 “The rise of the inflation rate is a base effect,
reflecting a drop in oil prices in July 2009,” said  Klaus Schruefer , an economist at Frankfurt-based SEB AG. “The rate
will fall below 1 percent in August and stay there for the rest
of the year.”  
 Heating Oil, Food  
 In Saxony, heating oil was 24 percent more expensive in the
year and fresh food prices were up 9.9 percent. In the month,
consumer prices rose 0.2 percent as the summer pushed up the
cost of package tours and holiday accommodation.  
 The European Central Bank aims to keep inflation just below
2 percent. It has kept its  benchmark interest rate  at a record
low of 1 percent since May 2009.  
 “There will be no conflict with the set targets of the
ECB, we don’t have to fear inflation rates above 2 percent,”
said  Jens Kramer , an economist at NordLB in Hanover. “German
inflation will remain below the euro-zone average.”  
 The ECB in June predicted inflation in the 16-nation euro
region will average 1.5 percent this year and 1.6 percent in
2011. The rate will rise to 1.7 percent this month from 1.4
percent in June, according to another  survey  of economists. That
report is due from the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg on July 30.
