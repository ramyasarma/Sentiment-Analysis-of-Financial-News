             China’s decision to allow the yuan
to strengthen against the dollar will fail to narrow the U.S.
 trade deficit  because the appreciation is not substantial,
according to the  Federal Reserve  of Cleveland.  
 The yuan, also known as renminbi, strengthened 0.7 percent
since June 19, when China scrapped a two-year-old peg to the
dollar. The U.S.’s trade deficit with China increased to $22.3
billion in May, the biggest since October.  
 “All else constant, a renminbi appreciation should raise
the dollar price of Chinese goods, lower the renminbi price of
U.S. goods, and whittle away at our trade deficit with that
country,” Owen Humpage, a senior economist at the Cleveland Fed
wrote in a research note published today on the website of the
regional central bank. “Still, unless the exchange rate moves
by a substantial amount, we probably will not see much of an
effect.”  
 U.S. lawmakers have urged China to allow the yuan to
appreciate more, saying the government keeps the currency
artificially low to maintain an export advantage. Congress will
consider trade sanctions against China for currency manipulation
as part of a package of measures to promote U.S. manufacturing,
House Majority Leader  Steny Hoyer  said on July 20.  
 International Monetary Fund staff considers the yuan to be
undervalued and has indicated that a stronger currency is in the
country’s economic interest, the institution’s mission chief to
China  Nigel Chalk  said on a conference call with reporters
today. He declined to say how much the yuan is undervalued.  
 The yuan was little changed today at 6.7778 per dollar. The
 12-month non-deliverable forwards  indicated traders expected the
currency to advance 1.3 percent over the period.  
 Until last month, China had left yuan unchanged around 6.83
per dollar since December 2008 to shield exporters from the
global financial crisis. Policy makers had allowed the yuan to
strengthen 21 percent from 2005 to 2008.
