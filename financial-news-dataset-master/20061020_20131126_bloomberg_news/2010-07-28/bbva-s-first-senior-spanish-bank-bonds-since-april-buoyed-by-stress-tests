             Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA 
offered the first public issue of senior unsecured securities by
a Spanish bank since April after the lender passed stress tests
and posted earnings that beat analysts’ forecasts.  
 Spain’s second-largest bank marketed 1.25 billion euros
($1.6 billion) the five-year notes at a spread of 170 basis
points more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a banker
involved in the sale. BBVA paid a spread of 85 basis points when
it raised 1 billion euros of five-year notes on April 12,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The tests revealed BBVA’s so-called Tier 1 capital, a
measure of its ability to absorb losses, would drop to 9.3
percent in a stressed environment, above the six percent pass
mark. The Bilbao-based lender today reported net income of 1.29
billion euros in the second quarter, beating the 1.23 billion-
euro average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “Given the current momentum after the stress test, this
seems to be an attractive level,” said  Dietmar Tzschentke,  a
Munich-based banking analyst at UniCredit SpA.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is helping BBVA to manage the
sale.  
 The bank has full access to all wholesale debt markets,
Chief Financial Officer Manuel Gonzalez Cid said in a webcast
for analysts today.
