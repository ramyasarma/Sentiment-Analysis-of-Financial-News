             GPT Group’s wholesale shopping
center fund is close to buying the Top Ryde City mall in Sydney
for A$600 million, the Australian Financial Review reported,
without saying where it got the information. The fund, with only
10 percent gearing, can use debt to fund about A$580 million of
investments, the report said, citing Credit Suisse Group AG
analysts.
