             Abu Dhabi office rents fell 27
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier and will drop
further as supply increases by more than half through 2012,
Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. said.  
 Vacancy rates reached 8 percent in the quarter and will
also probably increase over the coming years, the property
broker said in a research report published today. An abundance
of supply in neighboring Dubai will help push down rents, Jones
Lang said.  
 Office rents in Dubai dropped as much as 17 percent in the
second quarter as new space outstripped demand,  CB Richard Ellis
Group Inc.  said in a separate report today.  
 In Abu Dhabi, a shortage of Grade A office space is likely
to widen the gap between rents for the best buildings and lower-
rated properties, Jones Lang said. A significant share of the
offices under construction the United Arab Emirates capital
won’t meet international Grade A standards, it said.  
 Abu Dhabi has about 2 million square meters (21.5 million
square feet) of total office stock, and an additional 1.2
million square meters will come on the market by the end of 2012,
Jones Lang said.
