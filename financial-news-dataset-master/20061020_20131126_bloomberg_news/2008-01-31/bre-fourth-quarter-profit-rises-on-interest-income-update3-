             BRE Bank SA, the Polish unit of
 Commerzbank AG (CBK) , said fourth-quarter profit rose 23 percent on
higher lending income.  
 Net income  climbed to 142 million zloty ($58.5 million) from
115.2 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said
today in a regulatory statement. That missed the 164 million-zloty
median estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Net interest income, the difference between money paid on
deposits and earnings on loans, increased 46 percent to 291.1
million zloty. Fees and commissions rose to 135.7 million zloty
from 127.7 million zloty.  
 The bank had ``revenue weaker than expected, except for the
interest income, and the costs shot up,'' said  Marek Juras , an
analyst at Bank Zachodni. Costs rose 35 percent to 329.2 million
zloty on expansion expenses, marketing costs and bonuses, he said.  
 BRE's  shares  fell 2.9 percent to 372.9 zloty at 11:38 a.m. in
Warsaw trading. The stock has dropped 26 percent this year.  
 BRE, Poland's fifth-biggest bank, plans to invest 29 million
euros ($43 million) in the Czech Republic and Slovakia by 2012. The
company is seeking to tap growth in the countries that entered the
European Union in 2004. It booked about 20 million zloty for
expansion costs in the fourth quarter.  
 The Polish lender's pretax profit was also boosted by 42
million zloty income from its real estate unit, BRElokum.  
 BRE is recommending there be no dividend payout for 2007, it
said yesterday. The recommendation by the management board is based
on the continuation of the group's expansion plans and ``a need for
maintaining a solid capital base,'' BRE said.  
 The bank plans to boost deposits by 18.5 percent, lending by
34 percent and total assets by 21 percent this year, BRE also said
today. It's targeting a gross return on equity of more than 20
percent in 2008, the bank said.  
 BRE's mBank, an Internet unit, also plans to expand operations
in Europe, the bank said in the same statement.
