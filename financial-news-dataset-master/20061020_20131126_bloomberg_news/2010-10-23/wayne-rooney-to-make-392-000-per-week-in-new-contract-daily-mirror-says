Wayne Rooney’s new five-year
contract with Manchester United will pay him 250,000 pounds
($392,000) per week, the Daily Mirror said.  Rooney will earn a salary of 160,000 pounds per week, plus
another 90,000 pounds a week in image rights, the Mirror said.  Rooney signed the contract yesterday, two days after saying
he wanted to leave the 18-time English champion because it
lacked ambition in signing new players. He’s struggled this
season, scoring just one goal, after injuries and media reports
about his personal life limited his playing time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
