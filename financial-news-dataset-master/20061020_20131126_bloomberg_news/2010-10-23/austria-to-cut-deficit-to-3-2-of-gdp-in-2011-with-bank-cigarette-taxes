(Corrects second paragraph to show 400 million-euro tax is
on gasoline.)  Austria plans to raise taxes on
banks, gasoline and cigarettes and cut costs including some
family and pension benefits to cut its deficit by 2.8 billion
euros ($3.9 billion) next year and bring it down to 3.2 percent
of gross domestic product.  Chancellor  Werner Faymann ’s government approved a budget
plan that foresees complying with the European Union’s 3 percent
deficit ceiling in 2012, one year earlier than previously
projected. The plan includes additional tax revenue of 1.2
billion euros in 2011, including a 500 million-euro bank levy
and a 400 million-euro tax increase on gasoline, and 1.6 billion
euros of spending cuts, Faymann said in a statement today after
a government meeting in the spa town of Loipersdorf.  “This budget guarantees a stable course and is socially
balanced,” said Faymann, whose center-left Social Democrats
also gained approval for some tax increases on the wealthy in
return for agreeing on moderate pension cuts from 2013.
Conservative Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister  Josef Proell 
said the budget was “the first step out of the debt trap”.  Austria’s GDP may grow 2 percent this year and 1.9 percent
in 2011, the Wifo economic research institute, which compiles
government statistics, said in September, raising earlier
estimates.  Faster economic growth and higher tax revenue are the main
reasons why Austria will cut its deficit quicker than expected.
Under the budget plan, the deficit will drop to 2.9 percent of
GDP in 2012 and 2.5 percent for 2013. The deficit is projected
to be 4.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
