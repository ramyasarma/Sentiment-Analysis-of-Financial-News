Brazil’s government will introduce
“soon” a permanent program to sell real-denominated bonds in
the  international markets, Treasury Secretary  Arno Augustin 
told  O Estado de S. Paulo .  Brazil’s government is seeking to curb the appreciation of
the real, diminishing currency inflows into the country, the
newspaper said, citing Augustin. The sale of real-linked bonds
abroad will be regular from now on, he said, according to O
Estado.  Brazil is considering several currency measures to limit
the real rally and may announce them at any moment, Augustin
told O Estado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
