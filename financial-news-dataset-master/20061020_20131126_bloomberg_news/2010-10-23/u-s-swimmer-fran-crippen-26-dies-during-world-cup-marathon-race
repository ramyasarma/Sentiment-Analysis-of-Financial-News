Fran Crippen, an open water swimmer
from the U.S., died during today’s World Cup marathon race in
the United Arab Emirates. He was 26.  Crippen died during the last leg of the 10-kilometer race
in Fujairah, swimming world governing body FINA said in a
statement on its website, without disclosing a cause of death.
He won the bronze medal in the 10-kilometer event at last year’s
World Championships and took the bronze in the 5-kilometer race
at the 2010 Open Water Championships.  “Fran was a champion swimmer, but more importantly, a
tremendous person and he will be remembered for so many
extraordinary qualities,” USA Swimming said in a statement on
its website.  USA Swimming said it will continue to work with FINA and
meet officials to determine a cause of death.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
