Gunmen killed at least 13 people and
wounded 15 at a house party in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the city
across the border from El Paso, Texas, that is besieged by drug-
trafficker violence.  Seven of the dead have been identified, and range in age
from 16 to 25, and a 9-year-old was among the wounded, according
to an e-mailed statement from the state of Chihuahua, where
Juarez is the most populous city. There have been no arrests,
the statement said.  The gunmen arrived in two vehicles and began shooting at
partygoers in two houses in the neighborhood of Horizontes del
Sur, according to a preliminary investigation. Authorities
received a call related to the incident on an emergency hotline
at 10:54 p.m. local time. Police found 70 shell casings at the
scene, the statement said.  Juarez has been one of the hardest-hit Mexican cities in a
wave of drug-related killings that have exceeded 28,000 since
President  Felipe Calderon  took office in December 2006 and
deployed military troops to quell organized crime.  Calderon ordered Interior Minister  Jose Francisco Blake  to
help the state and local governments to maintain order in Juarez
and the federal attorney general to assist in the investigation,
according to an statement from the Interior Ministry, which is
in charge of domestic security. The federal government
“energetically condemns” the attack, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
