Germany urged China and Japan to
open their markets more, saying the euro region doesn’t
contribute to global imbalances.   German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said China and
Japan must open their markets more, while Bundesbank President
Axel Weber said Germany shouldn’t be blamed for having a
current-account surplus.   The euro region’s current-account position must be
considered as a whole, it doesn’t contribute to global
imbalances, Weber said.   Weber and Bruederle were speaking to reporters in Gyeongju,
South Korea today at a gathering of finance ministers and
central bank governors of the Group of 20 nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
