Nearly four in five British families
will be worse off as a result of the coalition government’s
spending cuts, the News of the World said, citing an ICM
Research Ltd. poll commissioned by the tabloid  newspaper .  Of those surveyed, 77 percent said they expect their
family’s income to fall as a consequence of Chancellor  George Osborne ’s plan to reduce the U.K. budget deficit by 81 billion
pounds ($127 billion). Seventy-three percent said they are
unlikely to get a pay increase this year, the newspaper
reported.  Osborne this week unveiled the deepest spending cuts ever
in Britain, eliminating almost 500,000 public-sector jobs and
shaving 7 billion pounds from the country’s welfare bill. Prime
Minister  David Cameron  said the cuts are vital to reducing the
U.K.’s record budget deficit.  Alan Johnson , Treasury spokesman
for the opposition Labour Party, said the program will hurt the
economic recovery.  Cameron’s Conservative Party has the support of 40 percent
of voters, an increase of 2 percent in the past two weeks,
according to the ICM poll. Labour’s support has also risen by 2
percent, to 36 percent, while backing for the Liberal Democrats,
Cameron’s coalition partner, has dropped 2 percent to 16
percent.  ICM surveyed 1,025 adults by telephone on Oct. 21 and Oct.
22, the News of the World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
