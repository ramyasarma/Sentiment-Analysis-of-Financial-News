The Group of 20 nations’ call to be
“vigilant” against disorderly currency movements was a re-
statement of long-standing principles and not targeted to any
one advanced economy, Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said.  People “should not impute any reference, at least in our
opinion, to the monetary policies of any advanced economy,”
Carney said at a press conference after this weekend’s meeting
of G-20 policy makers in Gyeongju, South Korea.  Earlier, German Economy Minister  Rainer Bruederle  said the
U.S. Federal Reserve shouldn’t try to “solve problems by adding
more liquidity” to its economy, and called plans to stimulate
the economy by so-called quantitative easing “an indirect
manipulation of an exchange rate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
