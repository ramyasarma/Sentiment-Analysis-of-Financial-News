A preseason game scheduled for
last night between the Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat was
canceled because the arena floor was ruled unsafe, the
National Basketball Association said.  The game at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa,
Florida, will not be rescheduled, the league said in an e-
mail.  Full refunds will be offered starting today to fans
who purchased their tickets, priced from $20 to $125, from
the Forum’s box office, according to the arena’s website.
All other purchases will be refunded from the places where
they were bought starting Oct. 25.  The court was slippery because an improper cleanser
was used on the wood surface, the Palm Beach Post reported.
Workers tried unsuccessfully to restore the floor in time
for the game.  “We worked throughout the day utilizing a vinegar and
water solution to remove that cleaning agent,” Forum
spokesman Bill Wickett told the newspaper.  Earlier yesterday, the Magic delayed their shootaround
before deciding to have a walk-through because of the slick
surface, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
