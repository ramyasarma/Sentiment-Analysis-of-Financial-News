Daimler AG  Chief Executive Officer
 Dieter Zetsche  said the German automaker and  Toyota Motor Corp. 
have held talks in the past and there have been “no concrete
results” of the meetings so far.  The two automakers are “testing the waters” without any
specific topics, Zetsche said, speaking while attending a forum
in Shanghai today. Daimler has “ongoing like meetings” with
some companies and Daimler and Toyota haven’t had a meeting
recently, he said.  Last month, the Yomiuri newspaper reported Toyota and
 Daimler  are in talks for a tie-up on hybrid technology. Toyota
neither confirmed nor denied the report and said Toyota is open
to selling its technology to other companies.  The Toyota City, Japan-based company currently provides
 Nissan Motor Co.  with hybrid technology for use in its Altima
sedans. In March, Toyota said it will supply the system to  Mazda
Motor Corp.   -- Liza Lin  in Shanghai. Editors:  Kae Inoue ,  Paul Tighe   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
