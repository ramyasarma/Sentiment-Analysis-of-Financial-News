Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda , reiterating that his country’s currency policy hasn’t
changed, said the government stands ready to counter a rise in
the yen if necessary to help the economy.  “While deflation is prolonging and the economy remains
severe, a prolonged appreciation in the yen isn’t good for
Japan’s economy,” Noda said at a press conference today after a
meeting of the Group of 20 nations in Gyeongju, South Korea.
“Our stance that we will take appropriate, bold action if
needed has been unchanged.”  In a joint statement released today, G-20 finance ministers
and central bankers pledged to refrain from “ competitive
devaluation” of exchange rates and said that “advanced
economies, including those with reserve currencies, will be
vigilant against excess volatility and disorderly movements in
exchange rates.”  Noda said the G-20’s reference to reserve currencies means
the dollar, the euro and the yen and that vigilance “means they
will cooperate with each other if needed while monitoring the
currency market.”  “We shared the common awareness of the issue and that was
one step forward,” Noda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
