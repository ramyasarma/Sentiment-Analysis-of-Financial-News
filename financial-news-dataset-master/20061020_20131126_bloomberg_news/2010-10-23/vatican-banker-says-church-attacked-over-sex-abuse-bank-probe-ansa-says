An Italian probe into the Vatican
Bank for alleged violations of money-laundering laws as well as
the clerical sex-abuse scandals show that the Roman Catholic
Church is under a “fierce attack,” news agency Ansa said,
citing Vatican Bank Chairman Ettore Gotti Tedeschi.  Gotti Tedeschi made his remarks today in a speech at a
forum in the central Italian town of Fermo, Ansa said. He
declined to comment on his remarks, Milko Vitali, the
conference’s moderator, said by phone.  Gotti Tedeschi said the attack began six months after the
publication last year of Pope Benedict XVI’s encyclical
“Caritas in Veritate” (Charity in Truth), which set out the
pontiff’s thoughts on capitalism and ways out of the worst
recession since World War II, Ansa said.  Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
