Vladimir Guerrero drove in three
runs and the Texas Rangers reached the World Series for the
first time with a 6-1 defeat of the defending-champion New York
Yankees.  Nelson Cruz added a two-run home run as the Rangers wrapped
up a 4-2 triumph in the best-of-seven American League
Championship Series and advanced to a World Series duel with the
San Francisco Giants or Philadelphia Phillies.  The Rangers’ World Series debut will come 2 1/2 months
after a group including Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan won a
bankruptcy auction for the franchise. Ryan’s group bought the
Rangers -- who filed for bankruptcy protection in May -- for
$593 million, the second-highest sale price for a Major League
Baseball franchise.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
