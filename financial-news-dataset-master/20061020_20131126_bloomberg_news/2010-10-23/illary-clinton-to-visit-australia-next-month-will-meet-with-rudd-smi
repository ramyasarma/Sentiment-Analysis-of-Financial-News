U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  and Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  will meet with
Australia’s Foreign Minister  Kevin Rudd  and Defence Minister
 Stephen Smith  in Melbourne next month.  Rudd and Smith will host the Australia-United States
Ministerial consultations in Melbourne on Nov. 8, the ministers
said in a statement today. It will be Clinton’s first visit to
Australia in her current role, they said.  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  named Rudd as her foreign
minister on Sept. 11, bringing him back into the government
after taking over from him as the country’s leader when he was
ousted by his Labor Party in June.  Gillard held on to power as Australia’s first female prime
minister after independent lawmakers and the Greens Party agreed
to help her govern following the deadlocked Aug. 21 election.  The ministerial consultations are held to strengthen the
Australia and U.S. alliance and last year’s talks were held in
Washington. Rudd met with Clinton in Washington in September and
Smith with Gates in Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi, in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
