Petroleo Brasileiro SA ’s Tupi field
in Brazil may hold more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable
oil, Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli told  O Estado 
de S.Paulo.  Gabrielli  said the estimate of 5 billion to 8 billion
barrels for Tupi is “conservative,” according to the
newspaper. Gabrielli said Petrobras, as the company is known,
may raise the forecast as it increases its knowledge of the
field, O Estado reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
