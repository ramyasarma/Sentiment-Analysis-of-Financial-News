Tata Motors’ Jaguar Land Rover unit
is in negotiations with a possible partner in China, group chief
executive Carl-Peter Forster said on the sidelines of a forum
today in Shanghai. No time frame has been set for agreeing a
pact, he said.  Forster added that the company was seeing a lot of interest
overseas in its small Nano car but had yet to decide on likely
export markets.  “We have a lot of interest, certainly more interest than
we can satisfy, from outside India and we have to decide which
country we have to go to first, we haven’t decided,” Forster
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
