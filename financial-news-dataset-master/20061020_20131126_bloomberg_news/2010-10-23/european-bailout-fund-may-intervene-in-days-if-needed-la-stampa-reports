The European Financial Stability
Facility may act in “a matter of days” if it ever needs to
assist a country with a Greek-style debt crisis, its Chief
Executive Officer  Klaus Regling  told La Stampa.  If assistance from Europe’s 750 billion-euro ($1 trillion)
bailout fund is required, it would take two or three weeks for
the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the
International Monetary Fund to determine the amount needed and
the conditions, Regling said in an interview published today.  “When they would then come to us, it would be a matter of
days,” Regling said, according to La Stampa.  To contact the reporters on this story:
