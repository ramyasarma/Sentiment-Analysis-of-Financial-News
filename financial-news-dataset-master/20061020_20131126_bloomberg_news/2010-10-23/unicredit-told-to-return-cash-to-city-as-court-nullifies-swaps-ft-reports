UniCredit SpA  may have to pay a
local municipal authority 650,000 euros ($905,000) after an
Italian court nullified derivatives contracts sold by the bank,
the Financial Times reported.  The court nullified three swap contracts because they did
not fully conform to Italian law, the newspaper said. Other
banks involved in court battles with Italian municipalities
include JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Deutsche Bank AG  and UBS AG, the
newspaper said. The municipalities argue that they were not
qualified to understand the risks being taken, the FT said.  UniCredit was not available to comment, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
