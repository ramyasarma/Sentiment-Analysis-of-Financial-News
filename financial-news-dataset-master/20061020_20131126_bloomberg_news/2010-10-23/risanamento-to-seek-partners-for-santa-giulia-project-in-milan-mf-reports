Risanamento SpA , the Italian real-
estate company that averted bankruptcy last year, will seek
partners for its Milan development Santa Giulia,  Milano Finanza 
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer  Claudio Calabi .  “The development of the Santa Giulia area has to be done
with someone else,” Calabi told MF in an interview published
today. The sale of the Falck area to Sesto Immobiliare SpA
announced on Oct. 22 will provide Risanamento with 131 million
euros ($182.4 million) in cash and help it cut its debt, the
newspaper cited Calabi as saying.  The Santa Giulia site was seized by a court on July 20 as
part of an investigation into possible environmental violations.  RN IM <EQUITY> CN  To contact the reporter on this story:
