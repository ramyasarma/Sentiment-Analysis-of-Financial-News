The Bank of Japan plans to buy BBB-
rated corporate bonds and a-2 commercial paper as part of its
latest monetary easing program to help companies obtain funds,
the Nikkei newspaper reported.  Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  and his policy board are
expected to outline the framework of the program at their next
meeting on Oct. 28 and discuss specifics at their November
gathering, the newspaper said, without citing anyone.  The central bank on Oct. 5 unveiled the 5 trillion yen
($61 billion) fund to purchase assets including government
bonds, exchange-traded funds and real-estate investment trusts.
It unexpectedly cut interest rates to near zero on the same day
to support an economy facing pressure from deflation and the
yen’s advance to a 15-year high against the dollar.  The central bank will allocate a total of 1 trillion yen
to the corporate bond and commercial paper purchases, the
Nikkei said. It will also consider a more flexible approach for
buying government bonds, compared with the current fixed pace,
in an effort to lower  interest rates , the report said.  Japan’s central bank bought corporate bonds and commercial
paper during the global financial crisis, though it restricted
those purchases to higher-grade securities. The latest round of
buying may start this year at the earliest, the Nikkei said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
