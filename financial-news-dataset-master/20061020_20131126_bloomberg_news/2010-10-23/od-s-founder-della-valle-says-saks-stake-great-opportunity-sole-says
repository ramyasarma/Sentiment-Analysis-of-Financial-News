Italian luxury group  Tod’s SpA ’s
founder  Diego Della Valle  said his almost 20 percent stake in
U.S. department-store  Saks Inc.  is a “great opportunity” that
has ‘enormous potential for expansion,” Il Sole 24 Ore said.  “There was also a sentimental aspect” in buying the stake
in Saks, Della Valle told the newspaper in an interview, adding
that he used to visit the New York department store as a boy. He
said he will explain his plans for Saks at a press conference in
New York City on Oct. 28, according to the newspaper.  Della Valle became the chain’s biggest shareholder this
week after raising his holding to 19.05 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
