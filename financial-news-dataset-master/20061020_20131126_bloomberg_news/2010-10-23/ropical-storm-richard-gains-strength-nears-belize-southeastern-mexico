Tropical Storm Richard gained
strength and may become a hurricane tomorrow as it approaches
the coast of Belize and southeastern Mexico, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory.  The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 65 miles (104
kilometers) per hour, was about 65 miles north-northwest of Cabo
Gracias a Dios, Nicaragua, near the Honduran border, the Miami-
based center said in its advisory at 11 a.m. New York time.  Richard is moving west at about 8 mph. The Honduran
government has issued a hurricane warning for the coast from
Limon west to Puerto Cortes and the Bay Islands, the U.S. agency
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
