(Corrects sentence in headline and first paragraph.)  A former employee of a U.S.
contractor in Afghanistan was sentenced today to 41 months in
prison for accepting $200,000 in bribes in return for steering
work to companies doing business with the U.S. military.  Daniel Freeman, of Hempstead, New York, told a U.S.
magistrate judge in Manhattan that from 2007 to 2009, he
accepted the gratuities while working in Afghanistan for a U.S.
military contractor later identified as KBR Inc. He also said he
laundered the money he received by sending the cash back to the
U.S. in concealed transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
