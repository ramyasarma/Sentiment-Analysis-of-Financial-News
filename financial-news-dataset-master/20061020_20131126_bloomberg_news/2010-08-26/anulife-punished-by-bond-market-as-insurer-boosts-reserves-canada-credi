             Manulife Financial Corp. ’s record
quarterly loss is raising borrowing costs for Canada’s largest
insurer at a time when the rest of the nation’s corporate bond
market is enjoying the lowest yields in 18 years.  
 Eight of the 10 worst-performing bonds in Canada this month
were issued by Manulife, led by a 6.17 percent decline in its
5.059 percent bond due in 2041. That has pushed yields on the
company’s bonds up by an average 0.38 percentage point relative
to government debt, compared with a drop of 0.07 percentage
point on average for companies in the  Merrill Lynch Canada
Financial Index .  
 Canada’s largest insurer posted a second-quarter loss of
C$2.4 billion ($2.3 billion) on Aug. 5 as declining stock prices
forced it to increase reserves to cover guarantees on products
such as annuities. Moody’s Investors Service placed Manulife’s
Aa3 financial strength rating on review for possible downgrade
the same day, while Standard & Poor’s lowered its  credit rating 
to A from A+, the third downgrade in 18 months.  
 “It’s increasingly clear that this isn’t as conservative a
name as it once was,”  Altaf Nanji , a credit analyst at Royal
Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in Toronto, said in a
telephone interview. “Certainly the market’s view of the credit
has soured somewhat.”  
 Manulife’s second-quarter results “were materially worse
than peers’, due to its more sizeable unhedged exposure to
variable annuity/segregated funds and its greater sensitivity to
low interest rates,” Moody’s said in a statement.  
 Manulife spokeswoman  Laurie Lupton  declined to comment.  
 Real-Return Bonds  
 Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to hold corporate debt rather than federal debt was
unchanged yesterday from a day earlier at 144 basis points, or
1.44 percentage points, according to a Merrill Lynch index.
Spreads were as wide as 154 basis points in June and as tight as
114 in March.  
 Corporate bonds have returned 2.11 percent to investors
this month, compared with government bonds’ 1.78 percent.  
 Canada auctioned C$400 million of 30-year real-return
bonds, drawing a median yield of 1.29 percent. The government
received bids of C$898 million for the 1.5 percent inflation-
indexed securities maturing in December 2044, according to a
statement on the Bank of Canada’s website.  
 Ontario sold an additional C$750 million of 4.2 percent
bonds due in June 2020, while Prince Edward Island sold C$100
million of 3.7 percent bonds due in September 2020. The premium
investors demand to hold provincial rather than federal debt was
58 basis points yesterday, unchanged from a day earlier,
according to a Merrill Lynch index.  
 Manulife Bonds  
 Manulife bonds in the Bank of America Lynch index have lost
1.14 percent this month, compared with a gain of 1.63 percent
for the index.  
 The lower credit ratings and rising yields may lead to
higher borrowing costs for Manulife, which has about C$12.7
billion in debt outstanding, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. The spread, or yield relative to government debt, on
the company’s 4.9 percent note maturing in 2014 widened to 193
basis points yesterday, from 113 on Aug. 4. An 80 basis-point
increase may add C$800,000 a year in interest costs on C$100
million in bonds.  
 Last week, the insurer completed a C$900 million sale of
4.079 percent medium-term notes due in 2015, priced to yield 189
basis points over government debt.  
 To protect against potential shortfalls, Manulife plans to
hedge or reinsure at least 70 percent of its variable annuity
guaranteed value by the end of 2012.  
 ‘Sector Perform’  
 RBC’s Nanji upgraded Manulife’s credit ranking to “sector
perform” Aug. 19, saying spreads now reflect “the company’s
outsized exposure” to financial markets. He said the spreads
aren’t likely to catch up to their smaller rivals such as  Sun
Life Financial Inc.  and  Great-West Lifeco Inc.   
 “While you might be comfortable with their overall
business profit, the fact is that in any given quarter, you
might be susceptible to how the financial markets perform,”
Nanji said. “It’s not a great position to be in as a credit
investor, where your upside is limited.”  
 Manulife’s 5.5 percent bond maturing in June 2018 has risen
4.2 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with a 7.8 percent climb for Great-West Lifeco
Inc.’s 6.14 percent bond maturing in the same year, and 7.1
percent for Sun Life’s 5.7 percent bond maturing in July 2019.  
 Manulife’s stock has plunged 39 percent this year, the
worst performer of the 41 companies on the S&P/TSX Financials
Index.
