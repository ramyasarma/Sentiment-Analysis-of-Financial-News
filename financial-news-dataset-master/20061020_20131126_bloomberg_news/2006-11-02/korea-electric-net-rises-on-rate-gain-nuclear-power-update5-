             Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760) , the
country's largest utility, said third-quarter profit rose 19
percent because of higher electricity prices and increased
generation of lower-cost nuclear power.  
 Net income climbed to 1.21 trillion won ($1.3 billion) from
1.02 trillion won a year earlier, the Seoul-based company, which
supplies almost all the power in  Asia 's third-biggest economy,
said in a statement today. The median estimate of seven analysts
surveyed by Thomson Financial was 1.17 trillion won.  
 South Korea 's government in December approved the company's
first power price increase in five years to cope with higher oil
and natural gas costs. Liquefied natural gas prices are linked to
oil, which surged to a record in July.  
 ``The results were satisfying especially when you consider
the pressure of fuel costs,'' said Lee Young Ah, who helps manage
about $1.8 billion in equities at SH Asset Management Co. in
 Seoul . ``LNG should drop more in the fourth quarter due to lower
crude prices.''  
 The company ran its nuclear reactors at full capacity in the
third quarter after shutting them down for maintenance earlier
this year, said Ji Chang Young, a manager at the utility's
investor relations team.  
 LNG burned at its plants accounted for 49 percent of Korea
Electric's fuel costs in the third quarter and coal made up 29
percent, Ji said. Fuel oil accounted for 13 percent and nuclear
fuel 9 percent.  
 Shares Gain  
 Crude  oil prices  in  New York  have fallen 25 percent from an
all-time high of $78.40 a barrel on July 14.  
 The company's shares rose 200 won, or 0.6 percent, to 36,200
won at the market's 3 p.m. close in Seoul. The stock has gained 7
percent in the past year, less than the 16 percent increase in
the benchmark Kospi index.  
 Korea Electric's fuel costs increased 10 percent from a year
earlier to 2.2 trillion won, Ji said. Operating profit, including
its six power generating units, gained 7 percent to 1.86 trillion
won, he said.  
 Nuclear plants generated 40 percent of Korea Electric's
power in the first half of this year, coal-fired plants produced
38 percent, gas-fired plants generated 17 percent and  fuel-oil 
generators produced 4 percent of electricity, Yoo Young Kuk, an
analyst at Meritz Securities Co. said.  
 Operating profit for the third quarter increased 28 percent
to 1.44 trillion won and sales gained 7.4 percent to 7.56
trillion won, the company said.
