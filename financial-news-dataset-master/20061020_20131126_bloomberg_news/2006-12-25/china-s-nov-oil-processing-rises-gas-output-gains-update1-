             China , the world's biggest oil user
after the U.S., increased crude oil processing by 6.4 percent
and gas production by 15 percent in November from a year earlier
to meet rising demand, according to government data.  
 Crude oil processing rose to 26.1 million metric tons last
month while gas production reached 5.1 billion cubic meters,
according to a faxed statement today from China Mainland
Marketing Research Co., which compiles data for the National
Bureau of Statistics.  
 Chinese oil companies want to maximize domestic energy
resources by opening new fields and extracting oil from sand and
rock to meet demand without adding to a swelling import bill.
Oil imports rose 15.6 percent to 133.6 million tons in the first
11 months, with the cost soaring 42.5 percent to $61.7 billion,
according to customs figures.  
 Crude oil processing rose 5.9 percent to 279.6 million tons
from January through November, and gas production climbed 20
percent to 53.1 billion cubic meters in the 11 months, today's
figures show.
