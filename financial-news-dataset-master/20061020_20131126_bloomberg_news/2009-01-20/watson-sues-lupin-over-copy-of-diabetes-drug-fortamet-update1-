             Watson Laboratories Inc. sued India’s
 Lupin Ltd. (LPC)  for alleged patent infringement over its plans to
market a generic version of the diabetes drug Fortamet in the
U.S.  
 The Davie, Florida-based unit of  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) 
and Fortamet distributor Sciele Pharma Inc. asked a judge in
papers filed Jan. 15 in Delaware’s federal court to prevent Lupin
from selling generic copies until the two patents expire.  
 “Lupin was aware of the existence” of the patents for the
drug, with the chemical name metformin hydrochloride, and its
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration  application “constituted an
act of infringement,” according to the complaint.  
 The patents were awarded in 2000 and 2005 to affiliates of
Andrx Corp.,  acquired  by Corona, California-based Watson in 2006.
Sciele was bought by  Shionogi & Co. (4507)  of  Osaka , Japan, in 2008.  
 Officials of Lupin in the U.S. and India didn’t immediately
return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  
 Watson, with $2.49 billion in 2007 sales, fell 82 cents to
$23.86 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.
Shionogi, with $1.87 billion in fiscal 2008  sales , rose
42 Japanese yen to 1,833 in Tokyo.  
 Mumbai-based Lupin, which reported $671.9 million in fiscal
2008 sales, rose 6.65 Indian rupees to 602.75 today.  
 The case is Sciele Pharma Inc. v. Lupin Ltd., 09CV37 U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
