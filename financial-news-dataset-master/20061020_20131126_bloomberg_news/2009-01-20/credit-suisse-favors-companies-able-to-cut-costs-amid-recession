             Health-care equipment, media and
telecommunications companies will be the most able to cut costs
and maximize earnings amid the global recession, according to
Credit Suisse Group.  
 “We look for the sectors with the lowest fixed costs, the
shortest asset life and bargaining power,”  Andrew Garthwaite ,
managing director of global equity strategy, wrote in a note
today. Transport, materials and utilities companies “appear the
least flexible.”  
 Companies best positioned to reduce costs include  China
Mobile Ltd. (941) ,  Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) ,  Dell Inc. (DELL) , Actelion Ltd. and  Nokia
Oyj. (NOK1V) , according to Garthwaite, while  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , Sulzer AG and
 Solarworld AG (SWV)  have “high fixed costs and operate in countries
with an inflexible economy.”  
 The European Commission yesterday predicted the euro-region
economy will shrink 1.9 percent in 2009, the first contraction
since the single European currency was introduced a decade ago,
amid the worst financial crisis since World War II.  
 “The risk is that U.S., U.K., European and Japanese GDP
growth will stay below 1.5 to 2 percent until 2011 owing to the
overhang of $5 trillion of excess leverage,” Garthwaite wrote.
