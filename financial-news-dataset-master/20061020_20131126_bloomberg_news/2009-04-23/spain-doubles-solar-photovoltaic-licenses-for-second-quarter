             Spain granted permission for 731
new solar photovoltaic installations to start construction in
the second quarter, 86 percent more than in the first three
months of the year.  
 With a combined capacity of 130 megawatts, the panels will
qualify for 25 years of guaranteed payments at rates
approximately eight times more than today’s wholesale
 electricity price , according to a note on the Industry
Ministry’s Web site.  
 The government imposed quarterly limits in September last
year on the amount of new solar plants that receive the
preferential ‘feed-in’ tariffs.  
 The industry ministry said it received 2,720 requests, more
than double those in the first quarter.
