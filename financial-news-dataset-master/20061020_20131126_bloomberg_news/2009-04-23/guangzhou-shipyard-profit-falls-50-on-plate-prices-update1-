             Guangzhou Shipyard International
Co. (317) , a unit of China’s biggest shipbuilder, said first-quarter
profit fell 50 percent because of higher prices of steel plates.  
 Net income for the three months ended March 31 declined to
129.3 million  yuan  ($18.9 million), or 0.26 yuan a share, from
258 million yuan, or 0.52 yuan, the company said in a statement
to the Shanghai stock exchange.  
 “They may still be using some of the high-priced inventory
acquired in the middle of 2008 when steel prices were high,”
Jack Xu, a Shanghai-based analyst at Sinopac Securities Asia
Ltd., said before the announcement. “The company had a very
good first quarter in 2008, which makes the comparison tough.”  
 Guangzhou Shipyard also incurred higher financing costs
during the period as it received fewer orders, according to an
April 9 exchange filing. Orders placed with Chinese shipbuilders
plunged 94 percent in the first three months, according to
government estimates, as a global recession erased demand for
ships to carry raw materials and consumer goods.  
 Guangzhou Shipyard fell 0.7 percent in Hong Kong trading to
close at HK$11.22 today before the earnings announcement. The
shares have surged 58 percent this year,  compared  with a 5.8
percent gain in the key Hang Seng Index.  
 The Guangzhou, southern China-based company completed and
delivered four vessels, the statement said. It secured orders
for building 60 vessels, with a total tonnage of 2.66 million
deadweight tons, it said.  
 Chinese shipyards may have cash shortages of about $30
billion in the next three to four years, the  China  Daily
reported on April 8, citing Li Li, a deputy general manager of
Export-Import Bank of China’s ship finance department.  
 The biggest decline in global  shipping rates  in two decades
led to a worldwide 95 percent decline in new vessel orders in
March, according to Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest shipbroker.
