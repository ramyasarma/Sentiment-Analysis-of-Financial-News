             Russia  will start natural-gas
deliveries to Europe via the planned South Stream pipeline no
later than 2015, Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko said.  
 Russia sees “no risks whatsoever” to the project’s
realization, Shmatko said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 OAO Gazprom, which plans to build the 900-kilometer (560-mile) pipeline under the  Black Sea  with  Eni SpA (ENI) , originally said
it would start shipping gas via the link in 2013. The state-run
gas exporter extended the start date to 2014 or 2015 earlier
this year.  
 South Stream, together with its twin pipeline  Nord Stream 
under the  Baltic Sea , is crucial to Russia’s plan to boost
exports to Europe while bypassing transit countries such as
Ukraine. Russia has reacted angrily to being excluded from a
European Union accord with Ukraine to upgrade the Ukrainian
pipeline system, making new routes redundant.  
 Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  abruptly canceled his
planned attendance of an energy conference that starts in
 Bulgaria  tomorrow. Shmatko will now lead the Russian delegation.  
 Bulgaria, which receives almost all its gas from Russia,
was one of the worst-affected countries when Gazprom cut off
exports to Europe via Ukraine during a price dispute in January.  
 Bulgaria has signed up for both South Stream and a rival
EU-backed project called Nabucco, which would bring Caspian gas
to central Europe via  Turkey , bypassing Russia. Neither project
has been started yet.
