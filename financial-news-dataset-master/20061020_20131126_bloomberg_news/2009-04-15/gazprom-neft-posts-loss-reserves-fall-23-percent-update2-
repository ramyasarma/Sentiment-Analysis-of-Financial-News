             OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil unit of
 Russia ’s natural-gas export monopoly, posted a fourth-quarter
loss on plunging crude prices and said proved oil reserves fell
23 percent last year.  
 The net loss was $543 million, compared with net income of
$1.32 billion in the year-earlier quarter, the St. Petersburg-
based company said today in a statement. The median estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had been for a loss of $172
million. Sales fell 25 percent to $5 billion.  
 The producer blamed the loss on a decline in oil prices,
down more than $100 a barrel from their  New York  record, as well
as export duties and a currency loss.  
 “The negative earnings surprise was mainly due to non-
operating items,” VTB Group said in an e-mailed research
statement today. “The company’s bottom line was hit by a $384
million foreign exchange loss and a $156 million loss from
equity affiliates.”  
 Full-year profit rose 12 percent to $4.7 billion on record
revenue of $33.1 billion. Proved oil  reserves  fell 23 percent
from the previous year to 3.25 billion barrels of oil equivalent
as of Dec. 31, 2008, according to an audit by DeGolyer and
MacNaughton. The drop was because of falling  oil prices  and the
switching of auditor from Miller and Lents in 2008, a Gazprom
Neft spokesperson, who asked not to be named in line with
company policy, said by phone from Moscow today.  
 Oil Production  
 Gazprom Neft’s oil output fell 5.6 percent last year to
30.74 million tons. Production by OAO Slavneft, its venture with
TNK-BP, dropped 6.4 percent to 19.57 million tons last year,
according to statistics from the Russian Energy Ministry’s CDU
TEK unit.  
 The company expects production this year to fall 5 percent
from 2008, Chief Financial Officer Vadim Yakovlev said on a
conference call today. Gazprom Neft expects East Siberian assets
to drive organic growth in 2011 or 2012.  
 Gazprom Neft plans to reduce  capital spending  by 43 percent
to $1.9 billion in 2009, according to a presentation. It based
its business plan on oil at $41 a barrel.  
 Yakovlev said that  dividends  from 2008 earnings would
likely be less than the 26 percent paid out on 2007 profit.  
 Gazprom plans to transfer licenses to  oil fields  with about
400 million tons of Russian classified C1 oil and gas condensate
reserves to Gazprom Neft, Boris Zilbermints, the company’s
deputy chief executive officer for exploration and production,
said on the call.  
 Gazprom will raise its  stake  in Gazprom Neft to 95.7
percent after it agreed to pay more than $4 billion to Eni SpA
for the Italian company’s 20 percent stake on April 7.  
 Gazprom Neft rose 2.6 percent to 93 rubles on Moscow’s
Micex Exchange.
