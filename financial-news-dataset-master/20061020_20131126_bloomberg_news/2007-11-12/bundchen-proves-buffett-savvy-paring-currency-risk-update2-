             Brazilian supermodel  Gisele Bundchen 
is proving to be as savvy as professional investors hedging
risks in the foreign-exchange market.  
 Bundchen, who Forbes magazine says earned an industry-best
$33 million in the year through June, is making sure she is paid
where she works, according to Patricia Bundchen, her twin sister
and manager. Bundchen's  Web site  says of her advertising
campaigns for 16 companies this year, nine are with ones in
Europe, three are Brazilian, one is Turkish and another is for
part of a Japanese firm. Two are from the U.S.  
 The 27-year-old model's currency prowess surfaced in the
Sept. 12 issue of the 1 million-circulation Brazilian weekly
Veja, which quoted Bundchen's preference to be paid in euros for
representing Cincinnati-based  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) 's Pantene
hair products.  
 Bloomberg News  has spoken to her manager and agent several
times since then and was the source of worldwide media reports
on Bundchen after an exclusive Nov. 5 story, ``Supermodel
Bundchen Joins Hedge Fund Managers Dumping Dollars,'' that
showed the model's affinity with  Warren Buffett  and  Bill Gross ,
both longtime bears on the dollar.  
 The U.S. currency fell to a record low last week against
the 34-year-old Trade Weighted Dollar Index, a foreign exchange
benchmark.  
 ``It's false that she only takes euros,'' Patricia Bundchen
said in a phone interview on Nov. 7 from  Porto Alegre , Brazil.
``It's a Brazilian contract, in reais,'' she said of the Pantene
contract.  
 `More Attractive'  
 That's turned out to be the better choice. The real has
risen 21.3 percent against the dollar this year, while the euro
gained 10.4 percent. The real is the best performer among the 26
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, thanks to
burgeoning global demand for Brazil's commodity exports. Only
the Canadian dollar has strengthened more among major
currencies, up 21.8 percent.  
 The real ``is clearly a runaway freight train,'' with the
country's interest rates attracting investors, said Lane Newman,
director of  currency trading  at ING Financial Markets LLC in  New
York . Brazil's benchmark overnight rate is 11.25 percent,
compared with 4.5 percent in the U.S. and 4 percent in the euro
region.  
 Bundchen, who lives in New York and dates  Tom Brady ,
quarterback of the New England Patriots football team, works for
companies ranging from Procter & Gamble and Columbus, Ohio-based
 Limited Brands Inc. (LTD) 's Victoria's Secret to Cacharel, which is
owned by Paris-based  L'Oreal SA (OR) , the world's largest cosmetics
maker.  
 Buffett, the 77-year-old billionaire, is among investors
who have been bullish on the real. In an Oct. 18 interview on
News Corp.'s Fox Business Network, the chairman of  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  said he was a buyer of the real.  
 ``I'm getting a million calls from the media and people we
work with,'' Patricia Bundchen said last week. ``All of a sudden
people are interested in the currencies Gisele earns, but we
don't talk about details of contracts.''
