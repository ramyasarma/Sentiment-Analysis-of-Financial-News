             Oleg Deripaska's United Co. Rusal
said it will seek to combine with  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN) ,
 Russia 's biggest mining company and valued at $53 billion, in the
next year and may buy shares on the open market.  
 A merger is ``in the interests of all shareholders,'' Rusal
Chief Executive Officer Alexander Bulygin said in e-mailed
answers to questions today. ``If the combination completes within
a year, in 10 years we can become the leader in metals and
mining, producing all the metals traded'' on the London Metal
Exchange, he said.  
 Rusal, the world's largest aluminum producer, yesterday
bought 25 percent of Norilsk from Onexim Group, an  investment
company  controlled by billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov . The aluminum
maker wants to merge with Norilsk to challenge the world's
biggest diversified mining company,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)   
 Prokhorov's Onexim received 14 percent of Rusal in return
for the shares it sold in Norilsk. His investment company also
got $7 billion in cash from the sale, the newspaper  Kommersant 
said today, citing unidentified bankers familiar with the
transaction.  
 Closely held Rusal may seek to raise its stake in Norilsk by
buying shares on the market if conditions are favorable, Bulygin
said.  
 Shareholder Talks  
 ``If not, increasing the stake is not a must,'' he said.
``We will review different ways to merge, discussing it with
Norilsk shareholders large and small.''  
 Vladimir Potanin  holds about 30 percent of Norilsk and is
the company's largest investor. Rusal said it plans to meet with
Potanin's Interros Holding Co. to discuss managing Norilsk.  
 Norilsk  rose  74.6 rubles or 1.1 percent, to 6,651.97 rubles
($280) at 5:50 p.m. in Moscow trading. The shares fell 3.1
percent yesterday after Rusal announced the stake purchase.  
 Deripaska, ranked by Forbes magazine as Russia's richest
man, is the controlling shareholder in Rusal. The company may be
worth $35 billion, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said in a March
report. A combination of Rusal and Norilsk would create a company
with a market capitalization of $90.5 billion, potentially rising
to $110 billion in a year, Lehman said.  
 Uniting Rusal and Norilsk is a ``target,'' while ``it is
still an open question'' which company would act as an acquirer,
Bulygin said. ``This is a technical question, which is not
important for us.''  
 `Unique Experience'  
 Rusal, formed last March in a merger between OAO Russian
Aluminum, Sual Group and the alumina assets of Glencore
International AG, has a ``unique experience in unifying three
companies,'' Bulygin said. ``We are consolidators.''  
 Separately, Norilsk began talks with OAO Metalloinvest on a
possible combination. Metalloinvest, controlled by billionaire
 Alisher Usmanov , is Russia's largest iron ore producer.  
 Bulygin said Rusal won't take an ``aggressive'' position to
block a deal with Metalloinvest.  
 ``We will, of course, be interested in hearing the
details,'' he said. ``In any deal, the most important thing is to
increase the value of the company, not use it for defensive
measures.''  
 Rusal doesn't want to ``spoil relations'' with global funds
that hold stakes in Norilsk as the aluminum company itself plans
to sell shares next year, Bulygin said.  
 ``The financial markets will calm down by then and the price
of aluminum will rise to $4,000 a ton at the very least,'' he
said. Aluminum for delivery in three months dropped 0.6 percent
to $2,986 a metric ton as of 4:27 p.m. on the LME.  
 Metalloinvest said yesterday it will continue to pursue
merger talks with Norilsk.
