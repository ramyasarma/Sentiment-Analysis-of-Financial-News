             PT International Nickel Indonesia (INCO) ,
the country's largest producer of the metal, said first-quarter
profit fell 39 percent because of lower prices.  
 Net income  dropped to $139.6 million in the three months
ended March 31, from $227.8 million a year ago, the Jakarta-
based company said in a statement to the Jakarta Stock Exchange.
Sales fell 15 percent to $380 million, it said.  
 The slide in profit followed a 24 percent decline in
fourth-quarter net income as nickel futures in  London  fell.
Nickel for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange
averaged $29,120 a metric ton in the three months ended March,
25 percent lower than $38,810 a ton a year ago.  
 PT Inco shares fell 2.3 percent to 6,500 rupiah at 10:34
a.m. in Jakarta trading. The stock has fallen 32 percent this
year, compared with the 18 percent drop in the benchmark index.  
 PT Inco produced 20,136 metric tons of nickel in the three
months, 12 percent higher than last year. It sold 17,700 tons of
the metal at $21,187 ton in the quarter, compared with sales of
15,100 tons at $29,149 a year earlier.  
 The company aims to produce as much as 79,000 tons of
nickel this year, President Director Arif Siregar said in a
statement posted on the company's Web site.  
 Brazil 's  Cia. Vale do Rio Doce , the world's largest iron-
ore producer, owns 60.8 percent of PT Inco after acquiring
Toronto-based Inco Ltd.
