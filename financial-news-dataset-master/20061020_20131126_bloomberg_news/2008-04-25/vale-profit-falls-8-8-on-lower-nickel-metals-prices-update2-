             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce, the world's
biggest iron-ore producer, said first-quarter profit fell 8.8
percent after a $318 million loss on metals trading and a drop in
the price of nickel, the company's second-biggest source of
revenue.  
 Net income declined to $2.02 billion, or 42 cents a share,
from $2.22 billion, or 46 cents, a year earlier, Rio de Janeiro-
based Vale said today in a statement. The results are based on
generally accepted U.S. accounting principles. Revenue rose 4.6
percent to $7.83 billion.  
 The loss from trading in non-ferrous metal futures compared
with a gain of $85 million a year earlier, the company said. The
average price of the nickel sold by Vale was 29 percent lower,
trimming $567 million from sales, the company said. Nickel makes
up a larger share of Vale's earnings after the company acquired
 Canada 's Inco Ltd. in January 2007.  
 ``Nickel had a significant first-quarter impact,'' Rogerio Zarpao, an analyst for Unibanco SA, said by telephone from  Sao
Paulo  before the results were announced. ``Vale's revenues will
in the future become less volatile due to the company's planned
iron-ore production capacity boost.''  
 Zarpao expected a 19 percent jump in Vale's net profit to
$2.64 billion, with net revenue up 7 percent from the year-
earlier period to $8.02 billion.  
 Vale had a loss of $318 million from trading in non-ferrous
metal futures, compared with a gain of $85 million in first
quarter of 2007. Profit was also hurt by the higher cost of raw
materials, energy and contract services.  
 Brazilian GAAP  
 According to generally accepted accounting principles in
 Brazil ,  net income  fell 56 percent to 2.25 billion reais ($1.34
billion), or 47 centavos a share, from 5.1 billion reais, or 1.06
reais. Net revenue fell 13 percent to 14.1 billion reais.  
 Rodrigo Ferraz, an analyst with Brascan Corretora in Rio de
Janeiro, had  forecast  in an e-mailed report that profit would
decline 12 percent to 4.49 billion reais.  
 Vale shares lost 1.49 reais, or 2.8 percent, to 51.21 reais
in Sao Paulo trading today, before the results were released. The
stock has gained 42 percent in the past year, compared with a 32
percent gain for the benchmark Bovespa index
