             Peru's  gold output  may drop 13 percent
this year as ore grades decline at Minera Yanacocha, the country's
biggest producer, said Isaac Cruz, president of the nation's
mining lobby.  
 Output at  Newmont Gold Corp. (NEM) 's Yanacocha, the world's second-
largest gold mine, dropped last year after environmental protests
kept the Denver-based company from bringing new deposits into
production, Cruz said today at a press conference in Lima. The
world's biggest gold mine, Grasberg in Indonesia, is owned by
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)   
 ``Mines like Yanacocha haven't been able to explore or start
up new deposits because of disputes with neighboring
communities,'' said Cruz, who is also chief executive officer of
zinc-mining company Sociedad Mineral El Brocal SA. ``We're going
to see the effects of these problems this year.''  
 Copper output  will rise 13 percent in 2007 on the January
start-up of an $850 million expansion of Phelps Dodge Corp.'s
Cerro Verde mine, and zinc output will rise 4 percent, Cruz said.  
 Companies plan to spend $22 billion over the next five years
on mining, oil, natural-gas and electricity projects, more than
the amount in the past 15 years, Cruz said.  
 Peru is the world's fifth-largest gold producer, fourth in
copper and third in zinc.
