             OMV AG (OMV) , Austria's biggest energy
company, asked Iran to participate in the Nabucco pipeline project
to ship natural gas from the Caspian Sea region and  Middle East  to
 Europe , Iran's oil minister said.  
 The Persian Gulf country is ready to take part in the
project, Gholamhossein Nozari said after meeting with OMV
officials in Vienna, where he is attending a ministerial meeting
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, according to
the state-run  Shana  news agency.  
 The 3,300-kilometer (2,050-mile) pipeline, backed by the
European Union, should bring gas from the Caspian via Turkey to
Austria and western Europe by 2013. OMV representatives will visit
Iran to determine the framework for cooperation, Shana said.  
 ``OMV is holding talks with Iran as we are studying the
possibility of shipping gas from Iran to Europe,'' spokesman
Thomas Huemer said by telephone from the Austrian capital today.  
 The Nabucco group comprises OMV, Budapest-based Mol Nyrt.,
 Germany 's RWE AG, Bulgaria's Bulgargaz EAD, Romania's Transgaz SA,
and Ankara-based Botas. The partners currently have no plans to
add Iran as a seventh partner in the group, Huemer said.
