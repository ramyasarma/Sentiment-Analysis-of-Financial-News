             California wine shipments fell in
2009 for the first time in 16 years as purchases in the U.K.,
the biggest export market, plunged during the global recession,
according to researcher Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates.  
 The global shipment volume of wine made in California
dropped by 1.6 percent, to 236 million cases, according to 11
months of data and December estimates from Jon Fredrikson, who
heads the wine research firm in Woodside, California.  
 Shipments to the U.K. plunged 36 percent because of the
recession, high taxes, rising duties on imports and the drop in
the value of the pound, which boosted California wine prices,
Fredrikson said today in a telephone interview. Shipments in the
U.S. fell 0.4 percent. Revenue for California wineries, whose
biggest product is Chardonnay, probably fell more than shipment
volumes as shoppers sought out cheaper bottles, he said.  
 “Today, frugality is hip,” said Fredrikson, who hasn’t
yet estimated 2009 revenue for the industry. “There’s a lot of
heartburn going on among industry planners.”  
 The global economy shrank 0.8 percent in 2009, according to
a report this month from the International Monetary Fund.  
 Total shipments out of California wineries, including
bottles produced abroad, increased 1.8 percent to 257.4 million
cases, according to Fredrikson.  
 Wine shipments throughout the U.S., including American and
imported wines, grew by 2.1 percent, said Fredrikson, who first
released the data this week at the Unified Wine & Grape
Symposium in Sacramento, California.  
 “American consumers are drinking wine, but they’re
drinking less-expensive wines,” said Gladys Horiuchi, a
spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based Wine Institute, which
represents more than 1,000 wineries in California.  
 Constellation Brands Inc., the world’s largest winemaker,
fell 9 cents to $16.08 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The company, the maker of Clos du Bois and
Robert Mondavi wines, is based in Victor, New York.
