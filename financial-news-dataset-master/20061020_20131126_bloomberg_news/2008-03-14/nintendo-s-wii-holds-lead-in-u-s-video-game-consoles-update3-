             Nintendo Co. kept the lead in U.S.
video-game console sales with 432,000 Wii players purchased in
stores last month, according to NPD Group Inc.  
 Retailers sold 280,800 of  Sony Corp. (6758) 's PlayStation 3 and
254,600 Xbox 360 consoles by  Microsoft (MSFT)  Corp. in February, the
Port Washington, New York-based researcher said today in an e-
mailed statement.  
 Console sales benefited from an increased supply of Wiis
and Xbox 360s, Lazard Capital Markets analyst  Colin Sebastian 
said in a March 11 report. Demand probably will pick up with the
release next month of games including ``Super Smash Bros.
Brawl'' for Wii and ``Grand Theft Auto IV'' for the PS3 and Xbox
360, the San Francisco-based analyst wrote.  
 ``This is clearly not an industry feeling a recession,''
Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities in
Los Angeles, said in an interview. ``We keep waiting for the
bubble to burst but it just seems to keep expanding.''  
 Sony's PS2 sold 351,800 consoles, a 19 percent increase
from the year earlier, NPD said. That's the first increase in
PS2 sales since November 2006, Pachter said.  
 Sales of the older console were helped by its low price, as
little as $99 during a weekend sale in Target Corp. stores, and
separately, by bundling the console with games such as ``Guitar
Hero'' and ``Rock Band,'' said Evan Wilson, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities in  Portland ,  Oregon .  
 ``This is the type of game people are buying a console
for,'' Wilson said in an e-mailed message. ``PS2 was the
cheapest, most available option.''  
 Shipments Diverted  
 Wiis were in short supply in January after Nintendo
diverted shipments to Japan for that country's holiday season,
Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime said last month
in an interview.  
 In February, Kyoto, Japan-based Nintendo began increasing
U.S. shipments to prepare for ``Smash Bros.,'' Fils-Aime said.
Xbox 360s also were scarcer in January because of higher-than-
expected demand during the U.S. holiday season, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said last month.  
 Nintendo's console sales increased 29 percent from a year
earlier, while Sony's more than doubled. Xbox 360 sales gained
12 percent.  
 ``Devil May Cry 4'' from  Osaka , Japan-based  Capcom Co. (9697) 's
U.S. unit sold a combined 528,700 copies for Xbox 360 and
PlayStation 3 to be the top-selling title.  Activision Inc. (ATVI) 's
``Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' had combined sales of
406,700 for the Wii and PlayStation 2.  
 Sales of video games, consoles and accessories jumped 34
percent to $1.33 billion from $992.2 million a year earlier.
Console sales rose 19 percent to $480 million, video-game sales
increased 47 percent to $668.7 million and accessories gained 36
percent to $185.3 million.  
 Microsoft fell 1 cent to $28.62 today in Nasdaq Stock
Market  trading . U.S.-traded Sony shares fell 5 cents to $43.31
on the  New York  Stock Exchange. Nintendo dropped 4.8 percent to
51,300 yen in Osaka.
