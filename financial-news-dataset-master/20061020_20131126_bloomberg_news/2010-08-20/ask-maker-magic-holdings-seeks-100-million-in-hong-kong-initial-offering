             Magic Holdings International Ltd. ,
which makes cosmetic facial masks, raised HK$660 million ($85
million) selling shares at the top of its price range in a Hong
Kong initial public offering, according to terms for the sale.  
 The Guangzhou, China-based company sold 200 million shares
for HK$3.30 each, the terms said. Magic Holdings had sought
HK$2.40 to HK$3.30, according to its IPO prospectus. BOC
International managed the offering, and the shares will begin
trading with the ticker 1633 on Sept. 24, the company said.  
 The deal values Magic Holdings at 23.2 times estimated 2010
profit and 18.1 times forecast 2011 earnings, the terms said.
After listing, the company may exercise an option to sell an
additional 30 million shares, according to the terms and the
prospectus.  
 About 35 percent of the sale’s proceeds will go into
marketing, while another 25 percent will be used to expand
facilities, according to the prospectus. A further 20 percent of
the proceeds will be used to develop new products.
