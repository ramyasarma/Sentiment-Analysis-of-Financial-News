             Gemina SpA (GEM) 's Aeroporti di Roma SpA
unit, the operator of  Rome 's two airports, said nine-month profit
declined 7 percent on higher energy costs and the absence of an
increase in fees charged to airlines.  
 Operating profit fell to 105.2 million euros ($131.9
million), Aeroporti di Roma said today in a statement distributed
through the Italian exchange. Sales rose 4.2 percent to 434.6
million euros, with revenue from flight operations rising 1
percent. Passenger traffic increased 7 percent in the period.  
 Italian airport managers have had their tariffs frozen for
about eight years. Alitalia SpA,  Italy 's biggest airline,
increased flights at its Rome Fiumicino hub in March in an effort
to stem mounting losses.
