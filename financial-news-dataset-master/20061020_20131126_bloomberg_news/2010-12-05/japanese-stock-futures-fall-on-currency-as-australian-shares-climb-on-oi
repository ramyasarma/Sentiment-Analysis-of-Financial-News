Japanese  stock   futures  fell as the
dollar plunged against the yen on Dec. 3, damping the
earnings outlook for exporters, while Australian shares rose
after oil and metal prices increased.  American depositary receipts of Sharp Corp., Japan’s No. 1.
maker of liquid-crystal displays, fell 0.8 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo on Dec. 3. Those of Toyota Motor
Corp., the No. 1 carmaker worldwide, declined 0.2 percent. BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world’s No. 1 mining company and Australia’s
biggest oil producer, climbed 0.2 percent in Sydney today.  “The dollar’s weakness against the yen on the backdrop of
a slow U.S. jobs recovery will weigh on some of the Japanese
exporters,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-
based Monex Inc. “Risk assets are moving into commodities.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
December closed at 10,170 in Chicago on Dec. 3, compared with
10,185 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,170
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index increased 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index gained 0.3 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index climbed 0.3 percent on Dec. 3 in New
York as a rally by energy and metals producers offset concern
that slower-than-estimated growth in payrolls will hamper an
economic recovery.  Commodities Advance  Crude oil for January delivery jumped 1.4 percent in New
York on Dec. 3 to $89.19 a barrel, the highest settlement since
Oct. 7, 2008, as the dollar tumbled and boosted the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment. Copper rose 0.5
percent on Dec. 3, while gold futures jumped 1.2 percent.  The dollar tumbled on Dec. 3 after U.S. Labor Department
figures showed payrolls increased by 39,000 last month, less
than the most pessimistic projection of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Unemployment held near a 26-year high.  The dollar traded at 82.68 yen today in Tokyo, near its
lowest level in three weeks. A weaker dollar reduces the value
of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into
their home currency.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  climbed 11 percent this year
through Dec. 3, compared with gains of 9.8 percent by the S&P
500 and 6.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 14.4 times for the S&P 500 and 12.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
