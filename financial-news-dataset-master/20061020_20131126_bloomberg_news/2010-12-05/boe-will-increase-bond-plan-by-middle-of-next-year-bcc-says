The Bank of England will have to
increase its asset-purchase plan by the middle of 2011 because
of the risks of a “setback” to economic growth, the British
Chambers of Commerce said.  The Monetary Policy Committee will increase its bond
 program  by 50 billion pounds ($78.5 billion) to 250 billion
pounds, the BCC said in an e-mailed report today in London. The
economy will grow 1.8 percent this year, 1.9 percent in 2011 and
2.1 percent in 2012, according to the lobby group’s forecasts.  “The MPC may be reluctant to increase quantitative easing
because of concerns over inflation,” BCC Chief Economist  David Kern  said in the statement. “But there is a strong case for
easing monetary policy further at a time when fiscal policy is
being tightened.”  Bank of England policy makers have split three ways over
whether to fight inflation by raising interest rates or add
stimulus to boost economic expansion. The government’s fiscal
watchdog last week cut its growth forecast for next year as the
government prepares to implement the deepest spending cuts since
World War II.  To contact the reporter on this story:
