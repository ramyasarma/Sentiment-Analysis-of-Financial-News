Former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich 
said he’s leaning toward running for president in 2012 and may
decide as soon as February.  “We’re much more inclined to run than not run,” Gingrich
said on “Fox News Sunday” today. “Everything we’ve done over
the last year, talking to friends, thinking things through, has
made us more inclined to believe that it’s doable.”  Gingrich, 67, said  Mitt Romney , the former Massachusetts
governor, is “probably the front-runner” in the race for the
Republican presidential nomination while former Arkansas
Governor  Mike Huckabee  is ahead “in popularity.” He called
former Alaska Governor  Sarah Palin  “a phenomenon in her own
right.”  Gingrich, a Georgian who led the “Republican Revolution”
in 1994, when the party gained 52 House seats, said he’ll
probably decide in late February or early March whether to run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
