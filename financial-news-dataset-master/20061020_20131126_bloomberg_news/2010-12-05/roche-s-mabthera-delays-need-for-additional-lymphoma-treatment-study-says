Roche Holding AG ’s MabThera medicine
helped keep a common form of blood cancer at bay without the
need for additional therapy, a study found.  Patients newly diagnosed with advanced follicular lymphoma
who were treated with MabThera decreased their risk of needing
additional treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy by 80
percent, compared with those who were just monitored, according
to the abstract of the company-funded study being presented at a
meeting of the  American Society of Hematology  in Orlando,
Florida. MabThera patients cut the risk of their disease
worsening by 79 percent, the study of 462 patients found.  MabThera, also called rituximab, in October won European
regulatory approval for the initial maintenance treatment of
patients with follicular lymphoma. The medicine is approved for
rheumatoid arthritis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in
addition to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. MabThera generated 1.52
billion Swiss francs ($1.52 billion) in revenue for Roche during
the third quarter.  “These data indicate that initial treatment with rituximab
significantly delays the need for new therapy and this finding
may change the management of patients with newly diagnosed
asymptomatic follicular lymphoma,” the study’s authors, which
included Kirit Ardeshna from University College London
Hospitals, wrote in the abstract.  Chemotherapy has shown no benefit when given to newly
diagnosed patients with follicular lymphoma and is usually
delayed until the disease progresses, according to the abstract.  Patients who were monitored needed to start treatment after
a median of 34 months, while the median time for MabThera
patients hasn’t been reached after four years, Roche said today
in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
