Serbia won tennis’s Davis Cup for the
first time after recovering to win 3-2 against France as  Viktor Troicki  beat  Michael Llodra  in the final match in Belgrade.  Troicki, in his first career meeting against Llodra, won 6-
2, 6-2, 6-3 to complete a turnaround after Serbia entered the
final day trailing 2-1 ahead of the last two singles matches.
Earlier, Novak Djokovic defeated  Gael Monfils  6-2, 6-2, 6-4 to
tie the match.  “This is the most unbelievable moment of my life,” the
British Broadcasting Corp. cited Troicki as saying.  France was seeking its 10th title in the sport’s elite team
competition for men and the first since 2001. Serbia was taking
part in the final for a first time.  Troicki, chosen to play the last match instead of the
higher-ranked  Janko Tipsarevic , secured his victory with a
backhand return. Djokovic, ranked No. 3 by the ATP Tour, twice
recovered from a break down in the third set against Monfils.  “Under the circumstances, with huge pressure, I played an
amazing match,” the BBC cited Djokovic as saying. “This is
like winning the World Cup for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
