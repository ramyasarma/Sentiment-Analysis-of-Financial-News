Sunderland beat West Ham 1-0 today at
the Stadium of Light to maintain its unbeaten home record in
English soccer’s Premier League this season.  Jordan Henderson got the only goal for the Black Cats, who
climb to seventh in the 20-team standings. West Ham, without an
away league win this campaign, slips to bottom position.  In today’s other game, West Bromwich Albion defeated
Newcastle 3-1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
