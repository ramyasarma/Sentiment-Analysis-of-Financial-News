Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection
Department reported “very high” air pollution at the city’s
three roadside monitoring stations.  The Air Pollution Index was 115 in Central, 144 in Causeway
Bay and 128 in Mong Kok as of 6 a.m., the department said on its
website.  Readings above 100 are classified “very high” and trigger
a government warning for people with heart or respiratory
ailments to avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
