Eni SpA  has reached a key production
target at its Zubair oil field in Iraq.  Production at the field near the city of Basra has
increased to 201,000 barrels a day from 183,000 when Eni and its
partners took over management of the field in February, the
Rome-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  “With this successful increase in production, the
consortium’s contract cost recovery commences, with the group
additionally earning a remuneration fee of $2 per barrel on
incremental oil production,” Eni said.  The Eni-led group plans to boost production at the field to
1.2 million barrels a day within six years and maintain that
level for another seven years, according to the statement.  Eni controls almost 33 percent of the group managing the
project, while Iraqi Missan Oil Co. owns 25 percent, Occidental
Petroleum Corp. has 23 percent and Korea Gas Corp. holds almost
19 percent, Eni said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
