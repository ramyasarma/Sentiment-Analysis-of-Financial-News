England will take a 306-run lead over
Australia into day four of the second Ashes cricket Test after
 Kevin Pietersen  struck an unbeaten double century to power his
team to 551-4.  Pietersen hit 213 at the Adelaide Oval yesterday for his
first century in 18 Tests. He shared stands of 175, 101 and 99
with  Alastair Cook ,  Paul Collingwood  and  Ian Bell  as England
racked up more than 500 runs in consecutive innings against
Australia for the first time in their 133-year-old rivalry.  “It’s wonderful to get runs, and it’s wonderful to put the
team in a position where we can win a Test match in Australia,”
Pietersen said in a news conference.  With two days remaining, Australia is battling to avoid
going 1-0 down in the best-of-five contest as it seeks to regain
the Ashes following last year’s 2-1 defeat in the U.K. England’s
last series win on Australian soil was 24 years ago.  A victory in Adelaide -- where England declared its first
innings at 551-6 four years ago before losing the match -- would
leave the touring team knowing a win in one of the remaining
three Tests would guarantee retaining the trophy.  “This is as big as it gets in the game and we want to do
the best we can to get out of this Test match,” Australia
captain  Ricky Ponting  told Channel Nine. “We’ll see what we’re
made of won’t we? Simple as that.”  Showers, Thunderstorms  Rain that prevented any play after the tea break yesterday
may yet help the home team avoid defeat. Australia’s Bureau of
Meteorology  forecasts  showers and thunderstorms for the final
two days in the so-called City of Churches.  Pietersen became the second England batsmen in as many
Tests to score a double century following  Alastair Cook ’s
career-best 235 not out in the drawn series opener in Brisbane,
where England amassed 517-1 to save the match. Cook was earlier
dismissed for 148, one of only two batsmen to fall on day three.  Pietersen, who struck 31 fours and one six in his unbeaten
296-ball innings, brought up his 100 and 200 with singles,
celebrating both milestones by punching the air. He’s the 10th
England player to score a double century in an Ashes Test.  The right-hander’s 17th Test century was his  first  since
March 2009 against the West Indies in Trinidad.  “I set myself high standards, and to get 80s, 90s, 99,
60s, 50s does my head in,” Pietersen added. “The state of the
game was one where it was needed for someone to continue playing
with a level head. We knew we needed to make sure we batted all
day to get us into a great position to win.”  Cook Caught  Cook and Pietersen had resumed with the score at 317-2 and
added 34 runs to the total before Cook was caught behind off an
inside edge from a Ryan Harris delivery.  Brad Haddin ’s one-handed diving catch ended Cook’s 17-hour,
38-minute crease occupation across two innings following his
effort in Brisbane. The left-handed opener has scored 450 runs
for two dismissals so far in the series at an average of 225.  Pietersen and Collingwood maintained the flow of runs after
Cook departed, lifting the score to 449-3 at lunch at a run-a-
minute. Their 101-run partnership was ended by  Shane Watson  when
he trapped Collingwood leg-before-wicket for 42.  Bell then joined Pietersen in the middle and they took the
lead to 306 runs at tea after punishing the bowling of Xavier
Doherty, one of three Australian bowlers to have conceded at
least 100 runs in the innings. Bell will resume on 41.  Early Start  Rain began falling during the break and the umpires called
off play shortly after 5 p.m. local time. Day four will start
half an hour earlier to make up for the 36 lost overs.  “I really do believe we are in a really strong position in
this game,” Pietersen added. “There’s enough time to win the
Test match.”  Australia was bowled out for 245 on day one after winning
the toss at a ground where it’s lost once in the past 15
matches. It was the home team’s worst performance in the first
innings at Adelaide since being skittled out by the West Indies
for 213 in 1993.  “We are way behind in the game and we’ve only got
ourselves to blame,” Watson told reporters. “So far we have
been totally outplayed.”  The series is tied at 0-0 after England recovered a 221-run
first-innings deficit to draw in Brisbane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
