The U.K. government may introduce
additional taxes on bank bonuses and disclosure rules ahead of
payouts in the New Year, the  Sunday Times  reported, citing
unidentified senior government officials.  The government wants to tackle financial institutions’
bonus culture, including adding a new levy similar to the one-
time 50 percent tax introduced by former chancellor of the
exchequer  Alistair Darling , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
