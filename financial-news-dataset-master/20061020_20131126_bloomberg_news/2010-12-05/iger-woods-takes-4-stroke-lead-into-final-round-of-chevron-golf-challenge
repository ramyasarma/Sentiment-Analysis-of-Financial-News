Tiger Woods  tops the leaderboard by
four strokes entering today’s final round of the  Chevron World
Challenge  at the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks,
California.  Woods, who hasn’t won a tournament in 2010, shot a four-
under 68 yesterday to finish the  third round  at 17-under 199.  “I’m excited how I’ve been hitting the golf ball, and how
I’ve been managing my game around this course,” Woods said at a
press conference yesterday. “This is going to be a fun test
tomorrow. I’m looking forward to it.”  U.S. Open champion  Graeme McDowell  is in second place at
13-under 203 and  Paul Casey  is in third place at 9-under 207.  Woods has won the Chevron World Challenge four times. It’s
an unofficial tournament with a field of 18 players selected
from the top 50 in world rankings and has a top prize of $1.2
million.  Woods last won 13 months ago at the Australian Masters. His
281-week run as world’s No. 1 golfer ended on Nov. 1, when  Lee Westwood  replaced him atop the rankings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
