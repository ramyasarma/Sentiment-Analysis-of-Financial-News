Advertising sales worldwide will
increase 5.4 percent to $412 billion next year, with Argentina,
India and China leading the way, according to researcher
MagnaGlobal, part of  Interpublic Group of Cos.   The forecast, up from 4.2 percent previously, reflects a
steadily improving global economy and brighter outlook for the
media industry, New York-based  Magna  said in a report. Growth
this year will reach 6.9 percent, exceeding the firm’s estimate
of 5.6 percent.  Online advertising will overtake newspapers as the world’s
second-largest ad medium behind TV by 2013, Magna said. Internet
ad revenue may reach $117 billion by 2016, according to Magna’s
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
