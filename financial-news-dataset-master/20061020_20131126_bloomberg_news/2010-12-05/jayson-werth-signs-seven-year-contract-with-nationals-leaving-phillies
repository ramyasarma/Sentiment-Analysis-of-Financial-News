All-Star outfielder  Jayson Werth 
agreed to a seven-year free agent contract with the Washington
Nationals after spending the past four seasons with the
Philadelphia Phillies.  The Nationals didn’t disclose financial terms of the
contract in a news release.  ESPN reported  that the 31-year-old
Werth will get $126 million over seven seasons, without saying
where it got the information.  Werth batted .296 with 27 home runs and 85 runs batted in
for the Phillies during the 2010 season. He led the National
League with 46 doubles, had a career-high .532 slugging
percentage and also stole 13 bases.  Werth has 87 homers over the past three seasons and may
help the Nationals offset the loss of first baseman  Adam Dunn ,
who signed with the Chicago White Sox. Dunn had a team-leading
38 homers for Washington last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
