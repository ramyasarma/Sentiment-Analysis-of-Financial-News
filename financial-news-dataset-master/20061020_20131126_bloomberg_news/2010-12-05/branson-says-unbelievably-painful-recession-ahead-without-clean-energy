British billionaire Richard Branson
predicted an “unbelievably painful” recession if the world
doesn’t move more quickly to a clean-energy economy.  “We are going to have the mother of all recessions if we
don’t sort out our energy policy fast,” Branson said today at a
conference in Cancun, Mexico, where United Nations-led
negotiations for a new climate change treaty are taking place.  Oil prices as high as $200 a barrel and lack of government
measures to encourage low-emissions energy sources, unemployment
in the U.S. could reach 15 percent in five years “without any
difficulty,” he said.  Branson is founder of Virgin Group Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
