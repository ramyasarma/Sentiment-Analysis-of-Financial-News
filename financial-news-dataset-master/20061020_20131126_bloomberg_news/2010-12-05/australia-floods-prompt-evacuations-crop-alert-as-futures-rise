Authorities in Australia ordered
evacuations in the nation’s most-populous state and warned of
crop damage as rains and floods swept the east coast, prompting
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia  to cut its wheat exports forecast.  Residents of three New South Wales communities were told to
leave as a nearby river was predicted to reach “major flood
level” last night, the State Emergency Service said. The body
of an 81-year-old man was recovered Dec. 4 in the northern state
of Queensland after the deluge swept away his vehicle.  Commonwealth Bank cut its estimate of wheat exports to 14
million metric tons in 2010-2011, from an earlier 16 million
tons. “Many in the industry suggest the disruptions to the
harvest this year and the implications for grain quality, are
the worst in a lifetime,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist
at the bank, said in a report yesterday.  Lower shipments may drive up wheat prices as the U.S.
Department of Agriculture forecast a 22.9 million-ton shortfall
in global production this season, the first deficit in three
years. The deluge in Australia, part of a La Nina event that
cools the Pacific Ocean and increases rainfall, helped drive
wheat futures 13 percent higher in Chicago last week.  New South Wales Emergency Services Minister  Steve Whan  said
at the weekend rains are likely to affect grain quality for
crops such as wheat, barley, canola, chickpeas and lupins. He
estimated A$500 million ($497 million) was wiped off the state’s
forecast A$3.2 billion winter harvest.  ABARE Report  The  Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics , in a report due on Dec. 7, may lower its estimate of
the nation’s harvest from 25 million tons and pare its forecast
on exports from 18 million tons, Commonwealth’s Mathews said.  “Australia is traditionally a producer of quality milling
wheat,” he said, referring to the grade used for food including
bread, pasta, and noodles. The rains may lower the quality of 6
million tons of milling wheat produced in the east coast, with
as much as 35 percent of the harvest, or 5 million tons, at risk
of being classified as feed-quality, he said.  Floods have begun to ease in Queensland and the southern
state of Victoria, local emergency services said. Victorian
farmers are now facing a swarm of locusts that the state
 Department of Primary Industries  says could be the worst plague
in 75 years.  Swarms have been reported at Charlton, Echuca, St Arnaud,
Quambatook and Wycheproof, with some stretching up to 25
kilometers (16 miles), the department said.  State Locust Director Stephen Nee said the swarms have the
potential to move quickly into other areas.  Swarms ‘Unpredictable’  “Locust swarms can be unpredictable, but with warmer
weather forecast in the state’s north this weekend, it’s
expected that greater numbers of locusts may start to fly,” he
said in a statement. “We urge motorists to take care as swarms
can impact on visibility when driving.”  Australia’s agricultural industry expanded 18.5 percent
last quarter, driven by “strong crop forecasts,” the Bureau of
Statistics said last week in a report that showed the economy
expanded 0.2 percent from three months earlier. That was the
worst performance since a contraction at the end of 2008.  Mick Keogh , executive director of the Australian Farm
Institute, said that if the data “for agriculture were
corrected for the loss of value in the crop sector due to the
rain, it is highly likely Australia would have experienced
negative change in GDP for the quarter,” The Australian
newspaper reported on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
