The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 3.92 cents to $2.9121 a
gallon, according to a survey.  The price covers the two-week period ended Dec. 3 and is
determined from data provided by 2,500 filling stations
nationwide to  Trilby Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst
in Camarillo, California.  Crude oil for January delivery surged 9.4 percent in the
two weeks ended Dec. 3, rising $7.68 to $89.19 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil gained as the dollar
dropped 1.9 percent against the euro, reducing the investment
appeal of dollar-denominated commodities.  “What we’re seeing is really just the tip of the
iceberg,” Lundberg said today in a telephone interview. “At
the retail level, we could see another six to eight more cents”
per gallon as refiners pass through higher crude costs.  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News were split over the
direction of crude oil prices next week amid signals the U.S.
economic recovery is accelerating while stockpiles climb.  Ten of 28 analysts, or 36 percent, forecast crude will
advance through Dec. 10. Ten more respondents predicted that
futures will be steady. Eight said there will be a decline. Last
week, 42 percent of analysts expected the market to be little
changed.  Price Stability  U.S. crude-oil  supplies  1.07 million barrels to 359.7

increase. Supplies are 1.8 percent below a year earlier and 4
percent above the five-year average for the period. Crude oil
inventories were 10 percent above the five-year average.  Demand  for gasoline, as measured by what refiners and
blenders supply to wholesalers rose 0.4 percent to 8.87 million
barrels a day. Averaged over four weeks, consumption was 0.5
percent below than a year earlier.  U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump in the week ended Nov. 26
rose 2.3 percent from the prior week, according to  MasterCard
Inc.  in its Nov. 30 SpendingPulse report.  On Long Island, regular gasoline averaged $3.21 a gallon,
the highest price in the continental U.S., Lundberg said. Los
