Vodafone Group Plc  is finalizing a
deal to sell its 44 percent stake in French mobile operator SFR
for 7 billion pounds ($11 billion) after talks with the owner of
the remaining shares,  Vivendi SA , the  Observer  said, without
saying where it got the information.  The move will make way for a 5 billion-pound buyback of
Vodafone’s own shares next year, the newspaper said. Vodafone is
also close to announcing an 800 million-pound sale of its 24
percent holding in Polish phone company Polkomtel SA, the
Observer said.  Vodafone spokesman  Bobby Leach  declined to comment when
contacted by telephone today.  Antoine Lefort , a spokesman in
Paris for Vivendi, also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
