The  South African Bank Note Company ,
a unit of the country’s central bank, has circulated large
quantities of defective 100 rand ($15) notes, bearing the
signatures of the bank’s Governor Gill Marcus and her
predecessor Tito Mboweni, the  Sunday Independent  reported,
citing unidentified sources.  The defects, which were caused by faulty printing machines,
were uncovered in May following an internal investigation, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said. While the central bank hasn’t
recalled the notes, it has requested that commercial banks
exchange them for ones with the correct security features, the
Sunday Independent said.  Hlengani Mathebula, the central bank’s spokesman, didn’t
immediately respond to a message left on his mobile phone.  Last month, the central bank said the managing director of
the South African Bank Note Company had been suspended following
the discovery of “issues” in its technical operations.  “South Africa’s bank notes are produced to the highest
international security standards,” the bank said in a Nov. 14
statement on its website. “The South African Reserve Bank has
complete confidence in their integrity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
