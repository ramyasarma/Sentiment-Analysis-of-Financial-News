X5 Retail Group NV  Chief Executive
Officer  Lev Khasis  said the food retailer will make a statement
about Kopeyka on Monday, after Reuters reported X5 agreed to buy
its smaller rival for $1.65 billion.  “We plan to issue a statement tomorrow regarding our talks
with Kopeyka,” Khasis said by phone late Sunday, declining to
be more specific.  X5 agreed to buy Kopeyka for 51.5 billion rubles ($1.65
billion), Reuters  reported  today, citing unidentified people
close to the transaction.  X5, Russia’s largest food retailer, in September received
antitrust approval to buy the Kopeyka supermarket chain, Khasis
said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
