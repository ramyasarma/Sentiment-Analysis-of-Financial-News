China’s spending on a national power
grid may account for 50 percent of the increase in the country’s
overall copper demand next year, Macquarie Group Ltd. said.  China’s overall copper demand is forecast to rise about
440,000 metric tons to 7.74 million tons in 2011, while the
national grid copper usage may rise from at least 700,000 tons
to over 1 million tons, Macquarie analyst Max Layton wrote in a
report dated tomorrow. Aluminum demand from the national grid
may rise by 500,000 to 1 million tons next year to 2.5 million
or 3 million tons, he wrote.  Separately, regulatory approval in the U.S. and U.K. for an
exchange-traded product for copper may be approved late in the
first quarter of 2011 “at the earliest,” according to the
report.  Power lines contain copper in transformers and aluminum in
power cables and semiconductors as transformers, according to
Macquarie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
