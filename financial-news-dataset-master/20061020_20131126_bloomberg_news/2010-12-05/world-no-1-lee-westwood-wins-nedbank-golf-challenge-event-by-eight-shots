Lee Westwood, the world’s top-ranked
golfer, won the Nedbank Golf Challenge in South Africa to claim
a prize of $1.25 million.  The Englishman finished on 17-under-par at the Gary Player
Country Club in Sun City, eight shots ahead of South Africa’s
Tim Clark. Retief Goosen of South Africa and Spain’s Miguel
Angel Jimenez were another shot back.  The 12-player field also included last year’s champion
Robert Allenby of Australia, who tied for seventh with Ireland’s
Padraig Harrington.  Westwood and Goosen both shot 4-under in the final round,
with Clark and Jimenez the only other players to beat par today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
