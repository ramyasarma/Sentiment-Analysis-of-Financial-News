Graeme McDowell beat Tiger Woods in
the first playoff in the 12-year history of golf’s Chevron World
Challenge.  Woods failed to end his 13-month winless run, his longest
as a professional golfer, after giving up a four-shot overnight
lead at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California.  Woods sank a two-foot putt on the final hole of regulation
play to tie McDowell at 16-under and force extra holes after the
U.S. Open champion made a birdie from about 25 feet.  McDowell then birdied  the first extra hole to claim the
title from four-time winner Woods, whose charitable foundation
hosts the tournament.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
