Seven people were injured and
required treatment in hospital after a party boat crashed into
moored vessels and a wharf at Sydney Harbor last night,
Australian police said today.  One man suffered suspected spinal and neck injuries and
others sustained broken arms and ribs, concussions and abrasions
in the incident that occurred at about 11:45 p.m. at Pyrmont Bay,
New South Wales state police said in a  statement .  The boat, carrying 39 passengers and four crew members, had
“extensive damage after crashing into several moored boats
before impacting heavily with the wharf,” police said. A 45-
year-old man, who was master of the vessel, was breath-tested
for alcohol and no traces were found, according to the statement.  A collision between a fishing trawler and an overloaded
cruiser in May 2008 left six people dead in what police
described as the worst fatal crash on the harbor in living
memory. The waterway is a focal point for tourism and recreation
in Australia’s largest city, including the annual New Year’s Eve
fireworks display.  Police said today that early indications suggested the boat
may have suffered mechanical failure prior to the crash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
