Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest
state oil company, raised official selling prices for all crude
types for customers in Asia, widening the premium for light
grades to the highest levels since the third quarter of 2008.  The company, the world’s largest crude exporter, also
increased all formula prices to buyers in the Mediterranean and
most to the U.S. and northwest Europe for January. The premium
for Extra Light crude to the U.S. was set at the highest in more
than six years, according to Bloomberg data on past prices.  Aramco increased the formula price the most for  Arab Super
Light  crude, a grade sold only to Asia, according to an e-mailed
statement today. The grade will cost $1.90 a barrel more in
January, rising to a $5.25 premium above the average of Oman and
Dubai oil, the two Gulf benchmarks used by traders.  The premiums over regional benchmark prices for that grade,
Extra Light and  Arab Light , Saudi Arabia’s largest export type,
reached highs as profit increased for Asian refiners, meaning
they earned relatively more from turning a barrel of crude oil
into refined products like gasoline.  The formula price Extra Light crude to Asia will be $1.30 a
barrel more in January, rising to a $3.10-a-barrel premium, the
highest since September 2008. Light Crude will rise by $1.25 a
barrel to a $1.60 premium over the average of Oman and Dubai
oils. That’s the widest premium since July 2008.  U.S. Buyers  Saudi Arabia’s state-owned producer set the price for its
Extra Light crude oil for January loadings for U.S. buyers at a
premium of $2.50 a barrel over the  Argus Sour Crude Index , $1.10
a barrel more than December cargoes. Light crude rose 50 cents
to a 25 cents-a-barrel premium for U.S. buyers. Aramco left Arab
Medium unchanged and cut Arab Heavy 40 cents to a $3.75 a barrel
discount for U.S. buyers.  The increase in prices to Asia exceeded expectations of
refiners in the region, according to a Bloomberg survey last
week. Light crude was expected to rise to a premium of $1.15 a
barrel, according to the median of six regional refiners.  Arab
Extra Light  was expected to rise to a $1.25 premium.  A shortage of diesel in China pushed up premiums for
cargoes traded in the spot market to three-year highs. The
supply crunch also helped raise  processing profits  for turning
crude into gasoil to $14.32 a barrel on Nov. 15, the highest
since January 2009, according to data from PVM Oil Associates.  OPEC Pricing  The largest Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
member and the group’s de-facto leader, Saudi Arabia has driven
production cuts announced in 2008 to support prices. OPEC left
quotas unchanged at its last meeting in Vienna in October.  Member countries meeting again this week in Quito, Ecuador,
to review output levels and demand are unlikely to change
quotas, oil ministers from Venezuela, Libya and Algeria said
last week. Ministers from the 12-nation group may seek tighter
compliance with OPEC’s existing output guidelines when they meet
Dec. 11, Libya’s top oil official,  Shokri Ghanem , said.  Venezuela’s  Rafael Ramirez  said $100 represents a “fair”
price for a barrel of oil. The ministers spoke at a gathering of
natural-gas exporting countries in Doha.  Crude oil for January delivery rose 3.29 percent on the New
York Mercantile Exchange during November to $84.11 a barrel at
the close of trading Nov. 30. Saudi Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi 
said Nov. 1 that crude-importing countries are happy with prices
between $70 and $90, a broader range than the $70-to-$80 spread
he said on March 30 was “as close to perfect as possible.”  Al Naimi  said at OPEC’s last meeting, on Oct. 14, that
market conditions were “ideal” as supply was meeting “good”
demand from Asia.  Saudi Output  Saudi Arabia pumped 8.235 million barrels of oil a day in
November, 15,000 less than in October and about 180,000 barrels
a day above its OPEC quota, according to Bloomberg estimates.  Aramco last month raised all crude grades for customers in
Asia for December, in a third consecutive monthly increase as
refining profit climbed. Aramco lowered its price formula on
light and medium grades to the U.S. for December and left prices
for Extra Light and Arab Heavy crudes unchanged.  The company boosted prices across the board on all grades
to all buyers for October delivery. The company supplied full
volumes to refiners in Asia throughout last year.  Saudi Arabia was the fourth-biggest exporter of crude to
the U.S. last year, dropping back from second place in 2008,
data from the U.S.  Energy Information Administration  show.
Canada, Mexico and Venezuela all shipped more crude to the U.S.,
the data show.  Pricing Tables  The following table gives the differentials of the four
