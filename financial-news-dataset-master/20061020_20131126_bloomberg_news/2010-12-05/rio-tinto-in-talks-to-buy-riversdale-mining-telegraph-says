Rio Tinto Plc is in talks to buy
Riversdale Mining Ltd. for about A$15 a share, the Daily
Telegraph in the U.K. reported. Any deal to buy Australia-listed
Riversdale, which has coal-mining projects in Africa, isn’t
certain to be completed, the newspaper said, citing people
familiar with the matter.   Riversdale shares closed at A$14.10 on Dec. 3 in Sydney.  Karen Halbert, a spokeswoman for Rio, said the company
doesn’t comment on market speculation. Bill Kemmery, a spokesman
for Riversdale at Sydney-based Fortbridge Consulting, declined
to comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
