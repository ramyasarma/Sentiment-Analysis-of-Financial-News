The euro rose toward a one-week high
against the yen after Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders 
said the region could increase the size of its 750 billion-euro
($1 trillion) bailout fund, easing concern over the debt crisis.  The common currency was close to a two-week high versus the
dollar after Reuters said yesterday the International Monetary
Fund will ask European officials to enlarge the aid package,
citing an IMF report it obtained. The New Zealand dollar fell
from near its strongest in almost two weeks as economists
forecast the South Pacific nation’s central bank to keep
interest rates unchanged during a meeting this week.  “European officials are taking one step after another to
cope with the debt crisis, even though they are being
reactive,” said  Kazuya Yashiro , a currency analyst at Himawari
Securities, Inc. in Tokyo. “The bias is for the euro to be
bought back in the near term.”  The euro advanced to 110.93 yen as of 8:19 a.m. in Tokyo
from 110.73 yen in New York on Dec. 3. It touched 111.19 yen on
Dec. 2, the highest level since Nov. 29. The single currency was
at $1.3412 from $1.3414 last week, after earlier rising to
$1.3442, the strongest level since Nov. 23. The yen dropped to
82.70 per dollar from 82.53.  New Zealand’s dollar fell to 76.51 U.S. cents from 76.60
cents last week, when it reached 76.75 cents, the most since Nov.
23. The currency was little changed at 63.28 yen.  Reynders Comment  Reynders told reporters in Brussels on Dec. 4 that the
rescue fund could be increased if governments decide to create a
larger one as part of a permanent crisis mechanism in 2013. “If
we decide this in the next weeks or months, why not apply it
immediately to the current facility?” he said.  European officials are under pressure to find new ways to
halt contagion spreading from  Greece  and  Ireland  amid concern
the bailout package may not be large enough to rescue  Spain  if
needed. The ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  last week extended
liquidity measures and the bank bought bonds to quell concern
some nations may default on their debt.  Finance ministers will meet in Brussels today. Reynders
said they will discuss the outlook for Portugal, which is
struggling to quash speculation it will also need a bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
