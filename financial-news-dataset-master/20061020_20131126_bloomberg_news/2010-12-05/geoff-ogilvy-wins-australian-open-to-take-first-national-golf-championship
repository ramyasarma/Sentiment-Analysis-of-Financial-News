Geoff Ogilvy won golf’s Australian
Open by four shots to take his national championship for the
first time.  Ogilvy, the world’s No. 43-ranked golfer, finished on a 19-
under-par total of 269 at The Lakes Golf Club in Sydney, after
earlier rounds of 68, 65 and 67. Countrymen Matt Jones and
Alistair Presnell tied for second.  “This is the one we all want to win as Australians,”
Ogilvy said after claiming his second victory of 2010. “One of
the goals we all have as a kid is to win this tournament.”  It was Ogilvy’s second win in his home country as a
professional, following the 2008 Australian PGA Championship,
and ninth tournamant victory in total.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
