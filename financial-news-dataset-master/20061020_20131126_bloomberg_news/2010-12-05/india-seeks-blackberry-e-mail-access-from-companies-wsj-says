India is in discussions with
companies using  Research in Motion Ltd.’s  BlackBerry e-mail
service to gain lawful access to its secure communications, the
Wall Street Journal reported.  Indian Home Secretary  G.K. Pillai  said a solution for
monitoring the BlackBerry Messenger chat service will be “fully
in place” by the end of January, the newspaper reported, citing
an interview with the minister. Pillai said Research in Motion
won’t face a service shutdown on Jan. 31 should India’s
surveillance demands not be met, the Journal reported.  The Indian government earlier this year threatened to ban
the BlackBerry corporate wireless e-mail service and Messenger
program because of their high levels of encryption that made
them difficult for intelligence agencies to intercept, the
Journal said. Pillai said the Jan. 31 deadline is “more of a
target,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
