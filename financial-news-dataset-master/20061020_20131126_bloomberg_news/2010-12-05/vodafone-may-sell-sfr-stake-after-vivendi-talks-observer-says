Vodafone Group Plc  is finalizing a
deal to sell its 44 percent stake in French mobile operator SFR
for 7 billion pounds ($11 billion), after talks with the owner
of the remaining shares,  Vivendi SA , the  Observer  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  That will make way for a 5 billion-pound buyback of
Vodafone’s own shares next year, the newspaper said. Vodafone is
close to announcing an 800 million-pound sale of its 24 percent
holding in Polish phone company Polkomtel SA, the Observer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
