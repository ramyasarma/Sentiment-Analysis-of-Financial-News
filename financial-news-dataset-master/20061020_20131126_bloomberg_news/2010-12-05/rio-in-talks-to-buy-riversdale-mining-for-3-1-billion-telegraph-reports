Rio Tinto Plc is in talks to buy
Riversdale Mining Ltd. for about A$15 a share, the London-based
Daily Telegraph  said , citing unidentified people familiar with
the matter.  A deal to buy Australia-listed Riversdale, which has coal-
mining projects in Africa, isn’t certain to be completed, the
newspaper said.  Karen Halbert , a spokeswoman for Rio in Australia, said the
company doesn’t comment on market speculation. Bill Kemmery, a
spokesman for Riversdale at Sydney-based Fortbridge Consulting,
declined to comment. Rio Tinto spokesman  Tony Shaffer  in London
also said the company doesn’t comment on speculation.  Riversdale shares closed at A$14.10 on Dec. 3 in Sydney.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
