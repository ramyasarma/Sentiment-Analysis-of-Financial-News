Bank of China Ltd.  will buy a $30
million stake in the initial public offering of  Huaneng
Renewables Corp. , the clean energy unit of China’s biggest
electricity producer.  The planned purchase was detailed in the prospectus for the
sale, released in Hong Kong today. Intended investments by
 Temasek Holdings Pte  and State Grid Corp. of China had already
been disclosed by people with knowledge of the transaction.  China Huaneng Group Corp. is seeking as much as $1.3
billion from Huaneng Renewables’s IPO. The sale will add to a
record $45.4 billion raised via initial public offerings in Hong
Kong this year, according to Bloomberg data excluding
overallotment shares.  On offer are 2.49 billion shares at HK$2.98 to HK$3.98
apiece, the prospectus shows. The company plans to set the price
on Dec. 10 and start trading on Dec. 16 using the stock exchange
ticker, or code, of 958.  Temasek, Singapore’s state investment company, will take a
$50 million stake, while State Grid will buy $60 million of
shares, the prospectus shows. China Chengtong Holdings Group Co.
will invest $10 million.  Morgan Stanley, China International Capital Corp., Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Macquarie Group Ltd. are managing the IPO.  China, the world’s biggest polluter, wants at least 15
percent of its energy to come from renewable sources by 2020.
China Huaneng Group plans to have 20,000 megawatts of wind-power
capacity by the end of the decade, or about 10 percent of its
estimated generating capacity, according to a company statement
on May 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
