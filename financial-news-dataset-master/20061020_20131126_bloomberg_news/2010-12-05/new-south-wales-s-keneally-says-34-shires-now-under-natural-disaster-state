Thirty four shires in New South Wales
have now been declared natural disaster areas after rains
pummeled the state in Australia’s southeast corner, Premier
 Kristina Keneally  said today after touring flood-stricken areas.  Rain has wiped as much as A$500 million ($496 million) off
the expected A$3.2 billion value of the winter crop, Keneally
said in a separate statement, citing industry and investment NSW
estimates. As many as 1800 residents have been evacuate. Another
4000 people have been isolated by floodwaters, the premier’s
statement said.  Australia’s east coast is being affected by a La Nina event
that’s cooling the Pacific Ocean and increasing rainfall,
producing the wettest August-to-October period on record, the
 Bureau of Meteorology  says. Thirteen river systems across NSW
have “minor to major” flooding, State Emergency Service
Commissioner Murray Kear said today.  “With a projected half-a-billion dollars wiped off the
value of crops in New South Wales, it is a sting in the tail for
farmers who have endured a decade of drought,” Keneally told
reporters in Wagga Wagga, about 452 kilometers (281 miles) south
west of Sydney.  The State Emergency Service has responded to 1300 calls for
assistance and carried out 66 flood rescues, Commissioner Kear
said today. The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting heavy rain
of as much as 100 millimeters in some areas of the state from
Dec. 8 to Dec. 10, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
