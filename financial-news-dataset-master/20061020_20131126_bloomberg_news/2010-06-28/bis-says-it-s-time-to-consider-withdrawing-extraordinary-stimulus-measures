             Central banks and governments should
consider withdrawing extraordinary measures to avoid skewing
investment decisions and delaying companies’ recording of
losses, the Bank for International Settlements said.  
 “The time has come to ask when and how these powerful
measures can be phased out,” the Basel, Switzerland-based BIS
said in its annual report published today. “The cumulating side
effects themselves pose a danger that, at the very least,
implies exiting sooner than may be comfortable for many.”  
 Keeping interest rates too low for too long “alters
investment decisions, postpones the recognition of losses,
increases risk-taking in the ensuing search for yield, and
encourages high levels of borrowing,” the bank said. Central
banks must also “confront booms in asset prices and credit as
being the threat to stable prices and growth that they are.”  
 The European Central Bank has kept interest rates at a
record low of 1 percent for more than a year and the Federal
Reserve stuck to a pledge on June 23 to keep its benchmark rate
a record low for an “extended period.” The spread of Greece’s
fiscal crisis through the southern euro region prompted the
Frankfurt-based ECB to expand its extraordinary measures on May
10 to include government  bond  purchases for the first time.  
 The  Greek  crisis also underscored the risk that governments
may no longer have the resources to support their banking
systems should they need it, the BIS said.  
 Less Maneuver Room  
 “The events coming out of Greece highlight the possibility
that highly indebted governments may not be able to act as buyer
of last resort to save banks in a crisis,” the BIS said. “If
the debt of the government itself becomes unmarketable, any
future bailout of the banking system would have to rely on
external help.”  
 Central banks’ “room for maneuver” to tackle any relapse
in the economy has also been reduced as interest rates are
historically low and central banks’ balance sheets are
“bloated,” according to the report.  
 “The sovereign debt crisis in Greece us clearly
jeopardizing Europe’s nascent recovery,” the BIS said. “It
will be difficult to find a source of further treatment should
another emergency arise.”
