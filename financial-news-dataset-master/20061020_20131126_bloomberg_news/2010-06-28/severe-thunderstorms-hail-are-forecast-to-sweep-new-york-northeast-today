             Severe thunderstorms, 1-inch-
diameter hail and wind gusts as intense as 70 miles (112
kilometers) per hour are likely to sweep New York and much of
the U.S. Northeast today, the  National Weather Service  said.  
 The storm could produce “supercell” thunderstorms, as
well as scattered tornados, according to the weather service.
The watch lasts until 8 p.m. in most areas.  
 “This is a dangerous storm,” the agency said in a
bulletin at about 1:30 New York time. “If you are in its path
prepare immediately for damaging winds, destructive hail and
deadly cloud-to-ground lightning.”  
 The watch stretches from northern Virginia to southern New
Hampshire and also includes Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Washington and Newark, New Jersey, according to the weather
service.  
 The storm has delayed some air traffic as long as 45
minutes at Washington’s Reagan National Airport and as long as
one hour at Dulles International, according to the Federal
Aviation Administration’s website.  
 Delta Air Lines Inc., the world’s largest carrier, has
canceled only six flights in the New York area because of the
storms, said a spokesman,  Anthony Black . The company also
operates a shuttle between Boston, New York and Washington and
those flights are running normally, he said.
