             Argentine warrants linked to gross
domestic product climbed to a two-month high after South
America’s second-biggest economy expanded faster than forecast.  
 The dollar-denominated warrants rose 0.18 cent on the
dollar to 8.20 cents at 4:16 p.m. New York time, the highest
since April 15.  
 Argentina’s national statistics agency Indec reported June
25 the economy expanded 9.7 percent on an annual basis during
April, surpassing the median estimate of 7.1 percent growth in a
Bloomberg survey of seven economists.  
 “The economic growth report was excellent and it’s given
the warrants a boost,” said  Javier Salvucci , a portfolio
manager with Silver Cloud Advisors in Buenos Aires. “The
theoretical value of the dollar warrants is about 12 or 13”
cents on the dollar, he said.  
 Argentina is “overstating the pace of” economic growth,
wrote  Carola Sandy , an economist with Credit Suisse Group AG, in
a report today from New York.  
 “We forecast that the official statistics will show that
real gross domestic product growth averaged 6.2 percent in 2010,
but, in our view, this figure will overstate the actual
expansion of GDP by at least one percentage point,” Sandy
wrote.  
 ‘Larger Payment’  
 Strong official GDP data “is good news for the holders of
the GDP warrants, as it will result in a larger payment in
2011,” Sandy wrote.  
 Economy Ministry spokesman Sergio Poggi did not return a
call to his office seeking comment.  
 The warrants are advancing after the government last week
closed its offer to restructure $18.3 billion worth of defaulted
bonds held out of a 2005 settlement.  
 Creditors holding about $12.1 billion of eligible defaulted
debt, or 66 percent of it, tendered their securities in a
restructuring that ended June 22, Economy Minister  Amado Boudou 
said June 23.  
 Argentina defaulted on a record $95 billion of debt in
2001.  Boudou  said a successful restructuring will help the
country regain access to international credit markets and lower
borrowing costs for provinces and companies that seek to sell
debt.  
 Argentina’s restructuring offer included the warrants, as
well as dollar bonds due in 2033 and bonds due in 2017 to pay
past-due interest. The offer didn’t include past-due payments on
the GDP warrants.  
 The annual payment on the GDP warrants, which were
distributed in 2005 to win approval for the government’s first
debt restructuring, is triggered when economic growth is above 3
percent and the inflation-adjusted value of the country’s GDP is
above the government’s base-case scenario laid out in the
warrants.  
 No Payment  
 Holders of the warrants will receive no payment this year
because the government said the economy expanded 0.9 percent in
2009, less than the growth threshold that triggers payments on
the securities. Argentina made a warrant payment of $3.11 on the
dollar on Dec. 15 after the economy grew 6.8 percent in 2008.  
 The peso slid 0.1 percent to 3.933 per dollar, its weakest
close since the currency’s inception in 1992, from 3.9308 at the
end of last week.
