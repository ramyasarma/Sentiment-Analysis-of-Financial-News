                  June 28 (Bloomberg) --Intercontinental Bank Plc, a lender
bailed out by the Central Bank of Nigeria, returned to
profitability in the first quarter of this year after recovering
some bad debts, Chief Executive Officer Lai Alabi said.  
 The company’s results for the three months through March
will be published “soon,” Alabi said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “We made huge recoveries, and all things being equal, we
intend to sustain the profitability and improve shareholders’
value,” he said.
