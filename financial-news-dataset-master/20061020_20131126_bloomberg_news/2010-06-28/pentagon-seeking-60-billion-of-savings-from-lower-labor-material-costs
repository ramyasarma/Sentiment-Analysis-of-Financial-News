             The U.S. Defense Department is
seeking savings of as much as $60 billion over the next five
years from lower labor and material costs on weapons and
military services, the government’s top weapons buyer said.  
 Defense contractors’ production processes “can be leaned
out, with fewer people or less material,” yielding savings that
will be plowed back into defense spending,  Ashton Carter , the
department’s head of weapons acquisitions said at a news
conference today after meeting with executives of suppliers
including  Lockheed Martin Corp.  and  Northrop Grumman Corp.   
 The Defense Department is aiming for 2 percent to 3 percent
in savings of the $400 billion the military spends each year on
weapons, services and other goods, Carter said.  
 Carter’s push builds on Defense Secretary  Robert Gates ’s
two-year drive to cancel unnecessary hardware and reduce waste.
Gates has said he wants to limit annual spending increases to 1
percent to 2 percent and has set a goal of saving $100 billion
over the next five years from reducing bureaucracy and improving
efficiency.
