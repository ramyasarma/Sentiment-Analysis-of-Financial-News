             E.On AG may sell its 3.5 percent
stake in Russia’s natural-gas monopoly OAO Gazprom, Interfax
reported, citing unidentified people.  
 The stake worth more than $4 billion will probably be sold
via one of Russia’s state companies in order to avoid drop in
Gazprom share prices, the newswire said.
