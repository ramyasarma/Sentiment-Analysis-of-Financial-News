             Limitless, a unit of Dubai World, is
ready to restart work on a $550 million hotel and luxury
apartment complex in Vietnam, after a delay of nearly one year,
Dau Tu newspaper reported, citing Nguyen Huu Giang, vice
director of the Quang Ninh department of planning and
investment. He said the delay was due to human resource and
financial issues. The report did not give a timeframe for the
restart.  
 Work on the Halong Star hotel project in the northern
coastal province of Quang Ninh started in 2007, according to the
newspaper. It is a joint venture between Limitless,
International Property Investment Partners LLC and Viet-My
Halong Joint-Stock Co., according to Dau Tu.
