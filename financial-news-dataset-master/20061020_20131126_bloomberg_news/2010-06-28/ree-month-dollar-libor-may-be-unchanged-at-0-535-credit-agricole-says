             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in dollars may be little changed today,
according to Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
may be 0.535 percent, said Orlando Green, a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole in London. The rate was 0.535
percent at the end of last week, data from the British Bankers’
Association showed.
