             Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. will sign a
$142 million contract with South Korea’s  Daewoo Shipbuilding &
Marine Engineering Co.  Ltd. for two vessels for oil products,
KUNA reported, citing KOTC Chairman Nabil Bouresli.  
 The tankers, to be handed over in 2012, will each have a
capacity of 110,000 tons, Bouresli said, according to the state
news  agency . The construction of the tankers is part of a plan
by the unit of state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp to modernize
its fleet and operate 33 tankers, Bouresli said.  
 Kuwait Oil Tanker signed a $708 million contract with
Daewoo in August 2008 for four very large crude carriers.  
 Kuwait, the third-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, plans to raise its output
capacity to 4 million barrels a day by 2020. The country pumped
2.35 million barrels of oil a day in May, according to Bloomberg
data.
