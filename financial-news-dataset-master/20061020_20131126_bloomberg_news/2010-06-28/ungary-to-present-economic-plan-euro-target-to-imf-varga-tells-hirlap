             Hungary will present economic plans
and forecasts to  International Monetary Fund  officials that will
help the country qualify for euro adoption, Magyar Hirlap
reported, citing an interview with  Mihaly Varga , the prime
minister’s chief of staff.  
 Hungary “without question” needs to have the continued
backing of international institutions, including the IMF, Varga
said, according to a transcript of the interview on the daily’s
 website .  
 The cabinet will present the plans to the IMF this summer,
Hirlap reported. IMF officials will review Hungary’s progress
toward meeting its budget pledges next month.  
 A special tax on banks and a 15 percent cut in aggregate
state wages announced this month make up the bulk of an
estimated 350 billion forint ($1.5 billion) in savings this year
that will help Hungary reduce its  budget deficit , Magyar Hirlap
reported, citing Varga.
