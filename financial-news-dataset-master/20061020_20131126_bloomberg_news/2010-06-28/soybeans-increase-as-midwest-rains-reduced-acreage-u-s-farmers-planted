             Soybeans rose, erasing an earlier
decline, on speculation that two weeks of excessive rain have
reduced the number of acres planted in the U.S., the biggest
exporter of the oilseed.  
 Some Midwest fields got more than 9 inches (23 centimeters)
of rain in the past two weeks, and Iowa, the biggest grower, is
headed for the wettest June since at least 1895,  T-Storm Weather 
in Chicago said in a report. The precipitation may mean fewer
soybean acres than the 78.1 million forecast by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture in March.  
 “There is a material loss in planted area” from northeast
Nebraska to northwest Ohio, said  Roy Huckabay , the executive
vice president at the Linn Group in Chicago. “Soybean planting
probably fell to 76.5 million acres.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery gained 6 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $9.18 a bushel at 1:12 p.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, after dropping 0.4 percent to $9.0825. The most-active
contract slipped 2 percent last week, the eighth decline in nine
weeks.  
 The soybean crop in the U.S., the world’s largest grower,
was valued at $31.8 billion last year, second only to corn at
$48.6 billion, government figures show.
