             Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. 
is scheduled to release a statement later today on the
pricing for its initial public offering in Shanghai.  
 The  bank  is selling as much as $11.4 billion of stock
in the Hong Kong portion of the sale, according to a  filing 
to Japan’s Ministry of Finance on June 24. Should it price
shares on sale in Shanghai at the same level, Agricultural
Bank would raise a combined $17.6 billion to $21.3 billion.  
 June’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  will be released on
Thursday. The index is expected to fall to 53.2 from 53.9
in May, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 10 economists.  
 China’s stocks  fell for a third day on Friday, led by
brokerages and industrial companies, on concern slowing
economic growth will erode corporate earnings.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger
of China’s stock exchanges, retreated 13.93, or 0.5 percent,
to 2,552.82 at the close on Friday. The  CSI 300 Index  fell
0.8 percent to 2,736.29. The Shanghai gauge gained 1.6
percent last week after the central bank said it will
increase the flexibility of the nation’s exchange rate.  
 Citic Securities Co.  and Haitong Securities Co.
dropped at least 1.8 percent after stock trading values
slid to the lowest in 18 months. Angang Steel Co. lost 1.7
percent and  Anhui Conch Cement Co. , China’s biggest maker
of the building material, slid 1.9 percent.  
 Yuan  
 The yuan had its biggest weekly gain last week since
December 2008 after China set the currency’s daily
reference rate at a record high.  
 The yuan rose 0.5 percent last week, and 0.1 percent
from Thursday, to 6.79 per dollar as of 5:51 p.m. in Hong
Kong. The central bank  fixed  the reference rate at 6.7896
per dollar, 0.3 percent stronger than Thursday and 0.15
percent higher than the close in the spot market. The yuan
is allowed to trade 0.5 percent on either side of the daily
fixing.  
 The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures funding
availability between banks, surged 29 basis points Friday
to 3.16 percent, extending last week’s gain to 47 basis
points, according to the daily fixing rate published by the
National Interbank Funding Center. The rate reached this
year’s high of 3.28 percent on June 2. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  
 Government bonds were little changed Friday. The yield
on the 1.77 percent note due in December 2013 was 2.64
percent, and the price of the security was 97.14 per 100
yuan face amount, according to the funding center.
