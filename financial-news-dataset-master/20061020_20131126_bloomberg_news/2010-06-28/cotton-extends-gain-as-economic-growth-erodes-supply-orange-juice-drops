             Cotton prices fell for the first
time in three sessions amid favorable U.S. growing conditions
and signs of a bigger increase in acreage than forecast. Orange-
juice futures climbed.  
 Growers may have sown 10.8 million acres (4.4 million
hectares) of cotton, up 18 percent from last year and the
biggest gain since 1995, according to the average estimate of 12
analysts and traders in a Bloomberg survey. Conditions are
“ideal,”  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in Mandeville,
Louisiana, said in an e-mail. He cited “beneficial rains” in
West Texas, the main growing area in the largest-producing
state.  
 “As June comes to a close, threats of hail losses
lessen,” Stevens said. “Traders widely anticipate an increase
in planted acres from March intentions.”  
 Cotton for December delivery fell 0.46 cent, or 0.6
percent, to 78.45 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
The price has gained 3.8 percent this year.  
 In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast
plantings on 10.505 million acres after surveying farmers. The
agency will update its estimate on June 30.  
 Earlier, prices climbed as much as 0.5 percent. Hedge-fund
managers and other large speculators increased their net-long
positions, or bets that futures will climb, by 12 percent in the
week ended June 22 from a week earlier, according to government
data.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 0.5 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $1.4295 a pound in New York. The commodity
has gained 11 percent this year.
