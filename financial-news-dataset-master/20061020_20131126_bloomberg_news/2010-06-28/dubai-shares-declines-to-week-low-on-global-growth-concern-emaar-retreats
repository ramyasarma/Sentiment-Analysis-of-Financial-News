             Dubai stocks fell to the lowest in
more than a week as a meeting of Group of 20 leaders failed to
reassure investors about the strength of the global economic
recovery and on concern banking earnings may disappoint.  
 Dubai’s  DFM General Index  lost 1.2 percent to 1,515.39, the
lowest since June 17.  Emaar Properties PJSC , the developer of
the world’s tallest skyscraper, led the drop and  Commercial Bank
of Dubai , which has a 4.4 percent weighting in the emirate’s
benchmark index, slid to the lowest in more than a year. Oman’s
MSM 30 Index declined 0.5 percent.  
 “The main focus for markets has been the G-20 meeting, as
there is a lot of speculation on the banking sector” globally
and locally, said  Paul Cooper , managing director at Sarasin-
Alpen & Partners Ltd. in Dubai, which oversees more than $500
million in the Middle East. Gulf investors “are waiting for the
earnings season to kick off” and find out about the banks’
provisioning, he said. Companies will start announcing second-
quarter earnings next month.  
 Dubai World’s creditor banks may have to set aside 10
percent of the value of their loans to the company to cover
losses after the state-owned company altered the terms on $23.5
billion of debt, Credit Suisse Group AG said June 15. The
company’s loans have a fair value of 44 cents to 46 cents to the
dollar after the restructuring proposal, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
said that day.  
 G-20 Meeting  
 Global efforts to tighten banking oversight have gained
momentum, U.S. President  Barack Obama  said following the G-20
meeting. Group leaders yesterday agreed to pursue higher capital
requirements for banks once their economic recoveries take root.
The leaders endorsed targets to cut deficits at least by half by
2013 and stabilize their debt-to-output ratios by 2016.  
 Emaar retreated 2.1 percent to 3.20 dirhams, the lowest
since June 17. Commercial Bank of Dubai dropped 4.9 percent to
2.90 dirhams, the lowest since May 2009, as 25,000 shares traded
in one transaction.  Deyaar Development PJSC , a Dubai-based
developer, decreased 4.4 percent to 33 fils. The shares had
tumbled 9.9 percent earlier today.  
 Crude oil fell from a seven-week high, losing as much as
1.1 percent to $78.02 a barrel.  
 Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  and Qatar’s  QE Index 
declined 0.3 percent. The  Kuwait SE Price Index  retreated 0.2
percent, while Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  and Bahrain’s  gauge 
increased 0.1 percent.
