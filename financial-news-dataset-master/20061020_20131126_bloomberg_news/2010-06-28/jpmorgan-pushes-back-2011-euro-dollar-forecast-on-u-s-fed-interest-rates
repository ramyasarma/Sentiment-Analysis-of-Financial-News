             The euro will only resume its
decline against the dollar in the second half of next year after
expectations for earlier U.S. interest-rate hikes faded,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said, revising an earlier call for the
European currency to begin weakening by the end of 2010.  
 “Having pushed back the first Fed hike to late 2011
last week, we expect euro-dollar to range trade for longer
around a mid-point of $1.25, so flatline the forecast at that
level until the second quarter of 2011,” John Normand, head of
global foreign-exchange strategy at JPMorgan in London, wrote in
a research report published on June 25. “From the third quarter
2011 forward, the dollar should strengthen as U.S. rate
expectations trend higher.”  
 JPMorgan had previously forecast the euro would fall to
$1.20 by the end of 2010 and $1.18 by the end of the first
quarter of 2011.  
 The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2343 as of 12:08 p.m. in
London.
