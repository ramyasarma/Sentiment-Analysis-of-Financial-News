             South Africa’s rand strengthened for
the first time in five days after leaders from the Group of 20
nations endorsed targets to cut fiscal deficits, easing concern
of defaults and boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  
 The rand appreciated as much as 1.3 percent to 7.5284 per
dollar before trading 0.4 percent stronger at 7.5968 by 4:10
p.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.6250.  
 Advanced economies said they will aim to at least halve
deficits by 2013 and stabilize their debt-to-output ratios by
2016, according to a statement released as leaders finished
meeting in Toronto yesterday. The G-20 also pledged to maintain
existing stimulus plans and take “concerted actions” to
sustain the global economic recovery.  
 “The G-20 meeting gave a very clear message on the need to
cut deficits and establish ceilings for public debt. Fiscal
austerity is now in vogue,”  Luis Costa , an emerging-markets
strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London, said by phone. “A big
public message like that helps lower market volatility and that
filters down positively into riskier currencies like the rand.”  
 Governments worldwide are designing new strategies to lower
their fiscal deficits and avoid a repeat of Europe’s sovereign
debt crisis that began when Greece’s deficit ballooned to 13
percent of GDP, more than four times the European Union limit.  
 Bonds rose in South Africa, with the benchmark 13.5 percent
security due September 2015 gaining 13 cents to 122.75 rand. The
yield on the security fell 3 basis points to 8.05 percent.  
 Investors increased bets that South Africa’s central bank
may lower its 6.5 percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next
meets on July 22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of
 three-month contracts  for cash in three months fell half a basis
point from their previous close to 6.4250 percent. The rate
reached a 6 1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on April 21.  
 The rand appreciated versus all but two of the 16 most-
actively traded currencies monitored by Bloomberg. The currency
advanced 0.8 percent against the euro to 9.3596.
