             Gold dropped in New York after the
precious metal failed to sustain gains above $1,260 an ounce,
prompting selling by investors who had earlier speculated that
prices would reach a record.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their  net-long position  in gold futures on the Comex in New York
by 4 percent to 238,634 contracts in the week ended June 22, the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said. A long position
is a bet on rising prices. Futures rose to an intraday high of
$1,263.70 an ounce today, or 0.2 percent from a record $1,266.50
reached a week ago.  
 “The only people buying gold here are investors,” said
 Leonard Kaplan , president of Prospector Asset Management in
Evanston, Illinois. “They’re fickle.” Prices may fall as low
as $1,230 an ounce, he said.  
 Gold for August delivery was down $12.50, or 1 percent, at
$1,243.70 an ounce on the Comex in New York as of 11:52 a.m.
local time. The metal for immediate delivery dropped 1 percent
to $1,242.85 an ounce in London.  
 Gold, up 13 percent this year, is set for a 10th straight
annual increase as investors seek to protect their wealth
against the crisis in Greece and other European nations
struggling to repay debt. The euro has lost almost 14 percent
this year against the dollar, prompting investors to buy gold
products including coins. Prices of the metal rose to records in
dollars, euros, pounds and Swiss francs this month.  
 ‘Ultimate Currency’  
 Prices may go higher on more investment purchases as people
seek to protect their wealth against depreciation of currencies,
 Bayram Dincer , an analyst at LGT Capital Management in
Pfaeffikon, Switzerland, said today in an e-mail. He forecast
prices to rise to $1,300 an ounce in two months.  
 “Gold is the ultimate currency and the ongoing global
currency substitution in favor of gold will continue,” Dincer
said.  
 Should the price continue to rise, consumers in India, the
world’s biggest gold user, may increase recycling of jewelry and
trim imports, according to Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri Pvt., the
Asian nation’s oldest retailer of gold jewelry.  
 India’s gold imports slumped to between 16 and 17 metric
tons in May, from 34 tons in April, Citigroup Inc. economists
 Rohini Malkani  and  Anushka Shah  said in a report June 21.  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, were unchanged at a record 1,316.18 tons
on June 25, according to the company’s website. Global holdings
of the metal by ETFs rose four tons to 2,062.6 tons June 25,
according to  Bloomberg data  from 10 providers.  
 ETF Record  
 Gold held in ETF Securities Ltd.’s European exchange-traded
products rose to a record $10 billion, accounting for half of
the provider’s total global assets under management, the London-
based company said today in a report.  
 “European investors’ demand for hard assets, particularly
precious metals, continues to grow as they look to reduce their
exposure to counterparty and currency-depreciation risks,”
 Hector McNeil , a London-based managing partner at ETF
Securities, said in the report.  
 Silver for immediate delivery, having rallied 13 percent
this year, will rise to $22 an ounce before December, said
 Daniel Brebner , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London, whose
fourth-quarter outlook was accurate to within 0.7 percent.  
 Silver futures for September delivery slid 0.4 percent to
$19.080 an ounce in New York. Platinum futures for October
settlement rose 0.1 percent at $1,576.10 an ounce, and palladium
futures for September delivery dropped 0.6 percent at $475.05 an
ounce.
