             Hearst Corp., the publisher of
Esquire and Cosmopolitan, hired  David Carey  from rival Condé
Nast as president of its magazine division.  
 Carey replaced  Cathleen Black , 66, who was promoted to
chairman of Hearst Magazines, the New York-based company said
today. Carey, 49, is returning to Hearst, where he was
Cosmopolitan’s marketing director before becoming SmartMoney’s
founding publisher in 1992,  Jessica Kleiman , a company
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  
 Magazine  advertising revenue  fell 3.9 percent in the first
quarter in the U.S. from a year earlier, according to
Publishers Information Bureau data. Hearst publications Marie
Claire, Good Housekeeping and Esquire fared better, with
increased ad revenue in the period.  
 Carey was group president at Condé Nast, where he managed
executive-focused publications including Wired and Golf Digest.
He was publisher of the New Yorker for seven years, returning it
to profitability, Hearst said. Carey helped start Portfolio, the
business magazine folded by Condé Nast in 2009 after two years.  
 Carey isn’t being replaced, said Mistrella Murphy, a
spokeswoman for Conde Nast.  
 Closely held Hearst publishes 14 magazines in the U.S. and
20 in the U.K.
