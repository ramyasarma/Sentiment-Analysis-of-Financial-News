             Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S.
mobile-phone company, cut the price of its two Microsoft Corp.
Kin models today about a month after the phones’ release.  
 The Kin One now sells for $29.99, down from $49.99, with a
$100 discount and a two-year contract, according to Basking
Ridge, New Jersey-based Verizon’s  website . The price of the Kin
Two, which has a larger screen and takes sharper photos, has
been reduced to $49.99 from $99.99, according to the site.  
 The phones, released in stores on May 13, are Microsoft’s
attempt to regain share in the smartphone market after losing
sales to phones from  Google Inc.  and Apple Inc. Before the Kin,
Microsoft had previously only developed software for phones,
rather than design help design them.  
 Verizon spokeswoman  Brenda Raney  said the new pricing is
part of a broader set of price reductions. The company is
“comfortable” with the way the Kin is being accepted, she
said. Katy Asher, a spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, declined to comment.  
 Microsoft’s Windows operating system accounted for 6.9
percent of the worldwide smartphone-software market in the first
quarter, down from 10.8 percent a year earlier, according to
Michael Morgan, an analyst at ABI Research. Shipments of the
iPhone rose to 15.8 percent and Android-based phones took 9.9
percent.  
 Verizon Communications Inc., which co-owns the wireless
company with Vodafone Group Plc,  rose  16 cents to $28.71 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:01 p.m. The stock has
declined 13 percent this year. Microsoft, down 20 percent this
year, fell 22 cents to $24.31 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
