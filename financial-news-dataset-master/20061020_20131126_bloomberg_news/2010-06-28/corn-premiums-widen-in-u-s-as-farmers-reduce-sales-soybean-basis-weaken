             Cash premiums for corn shipped to
export terminals near New Orleans rose relative to Chicago
futures as low prices discouraged sales by U.S. farmers. Soybean
premiums narrowed on signs of slowing exports.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in July
was 45 cents to 50 cents a bushel above July futures, compared
with 44 cents to 47 cents on June 25, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. July futures dropped 2 percent today,
touching the lowest price since the contract began trading in
February 2007.  
 “We are not seeing much farmer selling,” said  Garrett Toay , a commercial grain analyst for Toay Commodity Futures
Group LLC in Clive, Iowa. “We are reaching the point now where
any rallies are going to trigger increased farmer selling.”  
 The premium for soybeans delivered next month to loading
facilities at the mouth of the Mississippi River fell to 57
cents to 65 cents a bushel above July futures from 60 cents to
66 cents on June 25. Soybeans  inspected  for export in the week
ended June 24 fell 44 percent to 4.556 million bushels, compared
with 8.15 million a week earlier, the USDA said today.  
 “Inspections were a little disappointing,” Toay said.
“Everyone is waiting for lower prices” to increase
inventories, Toay said.  
 Corn futures for July delivery fell 6.75 cents to $3.3375 
on the CBOT, after touching $3.32. The contract has slipped 23
percent this year as rapid planting and favorable weather boost
yield prospects.  
 Soybean futures for July delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $9.55 in Chicago. The contract has fallen 9.8
percent this year on forecasts that combined output in Brazil
and Argentina will surge 37 percent to a record, reducing demand
for U.S. supplies.
