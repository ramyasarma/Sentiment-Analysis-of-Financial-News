             Thanachart Capital Pcl , a Thai
financial company, rose to its highest level in more than 12
years in Bangkok trading after Credit Suisse Group AG raised the
stock’s rating and price forecast.  
 The shares  climbed  5.4 percent to 29.5 baht as of 11:37 a.m.
local time, headed for their highest close since August 1997.
The stock was the best  performer  in the  SET50 Index , a measure
of the nation’s 50 largest publicly traded companies, which rose
0.9 percent.  
 Thanachart, whose businesses range from commercial banking
and insurance to stock broking, was upgraded to “neutral” from
“underperform” by Credit Suisse analysts  Thaniya Kevalee  and
 Dan Fineman , who said it’s unlikely that the company would be
forced by the regulator to raise capital.  
 The estimate for Thanachart’s earnings per share in 2010
was increased by 54 percent, after removing “the capital
increase assumption,” the analysts wrote in a note to clients
today. Thanachart “should not be forced” to raise capital
after its banking unit acquired Siam City Bank Pcl, they wrote.  
 Thanachart Bank Pcl, a Thai lender 51 percent owned by
Thanachart, raised its stake in state-owned  Siam City  to 99.2
percent, Thanachart said in a regulatory filing on June 11.
