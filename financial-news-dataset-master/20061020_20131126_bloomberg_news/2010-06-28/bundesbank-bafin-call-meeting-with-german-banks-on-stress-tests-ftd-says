             Germany’s Bundesbank and financial
regulator BaFin have called the country’s banking chiefs to a
meeting on June 30 to discuss the results of stress tests,
Financial Times Deutschland reported, without saying where it
got the information.  
 The banks have mostly completed the stress tests, though
the results are not yet known, the newspaper said. The
Bundesbank may be preparing the lenders for further potential
mandatory government aid, FTD said.
