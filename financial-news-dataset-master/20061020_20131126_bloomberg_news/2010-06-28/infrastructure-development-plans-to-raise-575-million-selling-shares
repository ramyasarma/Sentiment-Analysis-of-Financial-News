             Infrastructure Development Finance
Co. , India’s second-largest state-run lender for road, ports and
power projects by value, plans to raise as much as $575 million
selling shares to institutional investors.  
 The company will sell stock for about 168.25 rupees apiece,
according to a sale document obtained by Bloomberg News. Morgan
Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG, CLSA India Ltd. and IDFC
Capital Ltd. are managing the sale, according to the document.
IDFC  shares  climbed 1 percent to 170.25 rupees in Mumbai today.  
 The board of Mumbai-based  Infrastructure Development  on
April 27 approved plans to raise as much as 35 billion rupees
($757 million) to fund expansion, according to a statement to
the Bombay Stock Exchange. The lender was classified as an
infrastructure finance company by the central bank, the company
said on June 24, increasing access to funds.  
 “The infrastructure financing company status should
significantly ease lending and borrowing constraints,”  Dipankar Choudhury , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG said in a note to
clients on June 25. Banks can lend five percent more of net
owned funds to such companies than they can to others, Choudhury
said in the note.
