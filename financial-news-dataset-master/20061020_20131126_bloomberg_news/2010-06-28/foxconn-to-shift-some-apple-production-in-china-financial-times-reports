             Foxconn Technology Group plans to
move some of its production of Apple Inc.’s electronic products
to central China from the southern city of Shenzhen, the
Financial Times reported, citing executives close to the annual
negotiations between the two companies.  
 Foxconn and Apple declined to comment, according to the
newspaper. The Taiwanese company is planning the move because of
rising pay increases in Shenzhen after labor unrest and a string
of suicides at its plant, the Financial Times said.
