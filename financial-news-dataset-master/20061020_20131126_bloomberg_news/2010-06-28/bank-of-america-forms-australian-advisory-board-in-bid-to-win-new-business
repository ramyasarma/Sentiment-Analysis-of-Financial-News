             Bank of America Corp. , Australia’s
fourth-ranked arranger of takeovers this year, created an
advisory board in Australia overseen by ex-BHP Billiton Ltd.
Chairman  Don Argus  to help win more business.  
 Argus, a former New York Stock Exchange adviser, will be
joined by BHP director David Crawford, Ian Harper, a professor
at the University of Melbourne, and Megan Clark, head of
Australia’s national science agency, Bank of America told
employees today, according to a memo sent to Bloomberg News.  
 Bank of America trails JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank
AG and Nomura Holdings Inc. among Australia’s top merger
advisers of 2010. Craig Drummond, chief executive officer of
Bank of America in Australia, said in March he planned to return
the bank to a place in the top three.  
 “The establishment of an Australia advisory board is a
significant step forward,” the bank said in today’s note.  
 Nomura, Japan’s biggest brokerage, last month named
Woolworths Ltd. Chairman James Strong and Tower Australia Group
Ltd. Chairman Rob Thomas to a new advisory board.
