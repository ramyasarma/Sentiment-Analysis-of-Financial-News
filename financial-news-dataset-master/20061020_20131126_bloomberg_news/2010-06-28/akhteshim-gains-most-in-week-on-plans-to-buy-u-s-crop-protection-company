             Makhteshim-Agan Industries Ltd.  rose
the most in a week after the world’s biggest maker of generic
crop chemicals agreed to buy Albaugh Inc., a privately held
supplier of crop protection chemicals, for about $1 billion.  
 Makhteshim climbed as much as 3.2 percent, the biggest
advance since June 20, and was trading 2.4 percent higher at
14.14 shekels as of 10:05 a.m. in Tel Aviv. The stock has
declined 27 percent over the  past year .  
 “This acquisition is bigger than the market had expected
and it creates a great opportunity for Makhteshim, which was
seeking to get its foot through the door of the Americas,” said
 Gilad Sarig , an analyst at Bank Hapoalim Ltd.  
 Makhteshim, which  posted losses  in two of the last three
quarters, is looking to boost profit after insecticide prices
declined as farmers cut production amid the global recession.
Speculation of another merger in the industry increased after
Sumitomo Chemical Co. this year bought a 20 percent stake in
Nufarm Ltd., Australia’s largest farm chemicals supplier.  
 “This is a transformational acquisition for Makhteshim,”
Chief Executive Officer  Erez Vigodman  said in a statement
yesterday. “It extends our industry leadership to North and
South America, giving us the opportunity to participate in fast-
growing markets and significantly improving the global balance
and  diversity of our revenue sources .”  
 Tel Aviv-based Makhteshim will pay $340 million in cash,
$455 million in notes and issue 59 million shares, representing
a 12 percent stake, for Ankeny, Iowa-based Albaugh, the company
said yesterday. It also will assume up to $280 million of
Albaugh debt.  
 The deal, which requires approval from European and U.S.
regulators, is likely to close in the fourth quarter and add to
adjusted earnings a year later, Makhteshim said.  
 Shares of Koor Industries Ltd., which owns 44 percent of
Makhteshim, according to Bloomberg data, rose 1.1 percent to
71.71 shekels today.
