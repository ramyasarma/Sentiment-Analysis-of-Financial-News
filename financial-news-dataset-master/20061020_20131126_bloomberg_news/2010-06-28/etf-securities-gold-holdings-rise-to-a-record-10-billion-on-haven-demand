             Gold held in ETF Securities Ltd.’s
European exchange-traded products rose to a record $10 billion,
accounting for half of the provider’s total global assets under
management.  
 Its ETFS Physical Gold product held $5.2 billion of metal
as of June 11, and ETFS Gold Bullion Securities contained $4.8
billion, London-based  ETF Securities  said today in a report.
Total assets under management climbed to an all-time high $20
billion as of June 17 including commodity, currency and equity
products, up 70 percent from last July, it said.  
 Gold ETP holdings advanced to an all-time high this year
and coin sales from mints accelerated on buying by investors
seeking to protect their wealth from Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis and on concern the global economic recovery may falter.
Bullion climbed to a record $1,265.30 an ounce on June 21 and is
up 15 percent this year.  
 “European investors’ demand for hard assets, particularly
precious metals, continues to grow as they look to reduce their
exposure to counterparty and currency-depreciation risks,”
 Hector McNeil , a managing partner at ETF Securities, said in the
report. “Demand for the ETFS Physical Gold product has been
particularly strong since the euro crisis began.”  
 Its two bullion products are the biggest gold-backed
securities in Europe, ETF Securities said. The company also
provides precious-metals products in the U.S., Australia and
Asia.  
 Global holdings of the metal in ETPs increased four metric
tons to 2,062.6 tons on June 25, according to Bloomberg data
tracking 10 providers. Holdings in the U.S.-based  SPDR Gold
Trust , the world’s biggest exchange-traded fund backed by
bullion, were 1,316.18 tons on June 25, valuing its assets at
$52.28 billion.  
 Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,259.15 an ounce at
11:17 a.m. in London and is up 15 percent this year. Prices are
heading for a 10th straight annual increase, the longest run
since at least 1920.
