             Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. ,
ConocoPhillips’ partner in a venture off Australia’s northwest
coast, may complete a share sale of its South American
exploration business by the end of 2010, Merrill Lynch says.  
 The explorer’s Brazilian permits contain a prospective
resource of about 2 billion barrels of oil and an initial offer
has “significant scope to unlock value,” Sydney-based analyst
 James Bullen  said in a June 25 note.  
 Karoon, which has dropped 41 percent this year in Sydney
trading, is studying a plan to sell 30 percent of the South
American operations in an initial public offering in Brazil, it
said June 8. The sale could be concluded in the fourth quarter
of 2010, Merrill’s Bullen said. Merrill Lynch is a unit of Bank
of America Corp.  
 “There’s a possibility for the fourth quarter, that would
be the earliest,” Karoon spokesman James Wootton said by
telephone today. “There’s certainly no guarantee. Logistically,
there is plenty to wade through.”  
 Karoon fell 24 Australian cents, or 3.7 percent, to settle
at A$6.26 in Sydney, compared with a 0.7 percent decline in the
benchmark  S&P ASX 200 Index .  
 The explorer has five holdings in Brazil’s Santos Basin,
the same area where Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, has
made discoveries,  Karoon  said in a June 3 statement. In Peru,
Karoon owns a block in the Maranon Basin. The company said June
8 it’s yet to make final decision on the initial public offer.
