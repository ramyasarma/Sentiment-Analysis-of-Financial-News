             U.S. stocks fluctuated as gains in
tobacco and telephone companies were offset by a drop in energy
shares as oil retreated from a seven-week high. Treasuries rose.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,075.23 at 1:15 p.m. in New York after climbing as much as 0.5
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.29
points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 10,142.52 and rose as much
as 58 points. Crude oil tumbled 1.1 percent to $77.99 a barrel.
