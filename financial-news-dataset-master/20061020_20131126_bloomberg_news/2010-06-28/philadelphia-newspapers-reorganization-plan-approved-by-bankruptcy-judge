             Philadelphia Newspapers LLC won
bankruptcy court approval to reorganize and sell its
Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News publications to a group of
its lenders for $139 million.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge  Stephen Raslavich  approved the
reorganization plan today in Philadelphia after overruling
objections from union pension funds.  
 “This is not the end of the day,” Raslavich said in
court. “There are still union contracts to be negotiated and
the sale to be consummated.”  
 Under the reorganization plan, a group of lenders including
the hedge fund Angelo Gordon & Co. and a unit of  Credit Suisse
Group AG  has until Aug. 31 to complete its purchase of the
company and take control of the newspapers. The group is still
negotiating with the unions representing newspaper employees,
including reporters, editors and truck drivers.  
 Fred Hodara , an attorney for lenders, said the sale isn’t
likely to be completed before an Aug. 1 deadline for creditors
to file high-priority claims.  
 The company’s largest union, the Newspaper Guild, will meet
with the buyers for another round of negotiations next month,
Guild Executive Director Bill Ross said in an interview. The two
sides are negotiating the size of concessions the union will
make under a new contract, he said.  
 The new holding company for the newspapers and the other
assets being sold will be named Philadelphia Media Network Inc.,
according to court papers.  
 The case is In re Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, 09-11204,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania
(Philadelphia).
