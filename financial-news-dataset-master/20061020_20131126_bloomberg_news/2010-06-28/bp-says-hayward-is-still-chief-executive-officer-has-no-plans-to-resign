             BP Plc  said  Tony Hayward , who has
come under fire for his handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill, doesn’t plan to resign as chief executive officer.  
 Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin  said earlier
that Hayward may step down today and announce his successor
during a trip to Moscow, according to an aide who declined to be
identified because of government policy.  
 Sechin was speaking at Novo-Ogaryovo, where Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin has his residence outside of Moscow, the aide
said.  
 Sheila Williams , a London-based spokeswoman for BP, said
Hayward is still in his current position.  
 Shares of BP  rose  as much as 4.3 percent in London trading
and were at 313.95 pence as of 11:50 a.m. local time.
