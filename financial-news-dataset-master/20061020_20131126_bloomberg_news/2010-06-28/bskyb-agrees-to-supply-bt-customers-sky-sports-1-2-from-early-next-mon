             BT Group  Plc, the U.K.’s largest
phone company, signed an agreement with  British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc  to show the Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 channels and
expand its television offering.  
 BT customers can sign up for the subscription channels from
early July and view them from August 1, in time for the start of
the Premier League soccer season on August 14, the company said
in a statement today.  
 BT, based in London, increased broadband investment and
expanded into television services to counter declining revenue
at its fixed-line retail business. Prices for a package of
sports channels will cost less than 20 pounds ($30) a month, BT
Retail Chief Executive Officer  Gavin Patterson  said in May. The
BT Vision service had 467,000 subscribers at the end of March.  
 “We are delighted to have reached this milestone, which
means that we can be certain of offering Sky Sports 1 and Sky
Sports 2 to our customers before the football season kicks
off,” Patterson said today. “We know our customers will be
keen to sign up for the two channels.”
