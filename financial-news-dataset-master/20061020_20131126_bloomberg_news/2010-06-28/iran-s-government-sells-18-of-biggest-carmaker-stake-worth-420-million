             Iran’s government sold 18 percent of
the country’s largest carmaker, Iran Khodro, the Tehran Stock
Exchange said on its  website .  
 The state sold 1.13 billion shares at 3,687 rials ($0.37)
each, according to the website, which didn’t name the buyer.
That makes the stake worth about $420 million.  
 Parsian Brokerage , a subsidiary of privately owned Bank
Parsian, bought the shares, the state-run  Mehr  news agency said,
citing Ali Sahraei, markets manager of the stock exchange.  
 Iran Khodro is Iran’s biggest automaker with an average 65
percent share of domestic vehicle production, according to
state-run Press TV. It manufactures vehicles under 11 brand
names and has plants in seven countries, according to the
channel.
