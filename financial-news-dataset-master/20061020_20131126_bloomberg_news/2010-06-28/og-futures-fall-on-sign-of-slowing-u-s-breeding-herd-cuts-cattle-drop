             Hog futures fell the most in three
weeks on signs that cuts to the U.S. hog herd have slowed as
farmer profits returned. Cattle climbed.  
 The  hog-breeding  herd totaled 5.788 million sows on June 1,
down 3 percent from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said June 25 after markets closed in Chicago. That
was less than a 3.5 percent decline expected by analysts and a
0.5 percent increase from the previous quarter, when supplies
were the smallest on record. Farmers began making profits in
March after losing money during the previous two years.  
 The USDA report showed “hints of expansion,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des
Moines, Iowa. “There’s been some profitability, so liquidation
has come to halt. Producers are not expanding yet, but they may
be looking to do that down the road.”  
 Hog futures for August settlement fell 1.75 cents, or 2.1
percent, to 82.175 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. That marked the biggest drop for a most-active
contract since June 7. Futures have climbed 25 percent this year
as pork demand recovered from the recession and swine flu last
year.  
 Efficiency gains are also a “headwind” for hog prices,
 Ken Goldman , an analyst for JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York,
said today in a note. Sows averaged 9.81 pigs per litter during
the three months ended May 31, the most for any quarter on
record, the USDA said.  
 ‘More Pigs’  
 “The hog-farming industry continues to improve its
productivity,” Goldman wrote. “The more pigs per litter, the
higher that supply will go.”  
 Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.3 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 89.675 cents a pound. The most-active contract is up
4.1 percent this year. Feeder-cattle futures for August
settlement climbed 0.775 cent, or 0.7 percent, to $1.13975 a
pound.  
 Wholesale choice beef  rose 0.1 percent at midday to $1.5447
a pound, according to the USDA. The price has climbed for two
straight weeks, boosting meatpacker profits.  
 “The one positive is the packer continues to have big
margins,” said Roose of U.S. Commodities. “He’s making about
$37 per head, so he has some money to work with.”
