             Brazil’s real fluctuated between
gains and losses as forecasts of increased gross domestic
product in 2010 offset declines in equity futures.  
 The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.7828 per dollar at 9:12 a.m.
New York time, from 1.7802 on June 25.  
 A June 25 central bank survey of about 100 economists
showed forecasts for 2010 GDP rose to 7.13 percent, up from 7.06
percent a week earlier. Brazil’s Bovespa stock-index futures
dropped 0.1 percent to 65,735.  
 “The GDP numbers mean that people are upgrading their
expectations of growth, and generally that should be supportive
of the real,” said  Roberto Melzi , a currency strategist at
Barclays Capital in New York. “If you see the dynamics of the
real in the last few months, those dynamics have been closely
linked to global factors, namely equity markets.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January was unchanged at 11.31 percent.
