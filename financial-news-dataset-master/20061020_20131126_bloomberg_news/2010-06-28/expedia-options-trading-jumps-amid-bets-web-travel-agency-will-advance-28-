             Trading of bullish  Expedia Inc. 
options jumped to six times the four-week average as investors
boosted bets that the discount Internet travel agency will pare
this year’s loss by rallying 28 percent in the next four months.  
 More than 5,300 calls to buy the stock changed hands, the
most in six weeks and 13 times the number of puts to sell. The
stock, down 24 percent this year before today, gained 1.2
percent to $19.80 as of 12:15 p.m. in New York. The  most-active
contracts  were October $25 calls, which accounted for more than
three quarters of the volume and were unchanged at 35 cents.  
 Almost all of the October $25 calls changed hands at the
ask price and they had a total of 1,573 outstanding contracts
before today, which indicates that buyers creating new bullish
positions accounted for most of today’s trading. Expedia hasn’t
 closed  above $25 since April 20, and a rally back to that level
would be a 28 percent gain from the last close.  
 “Buyers are dominating the action,” said  Frederic Ruffy ,
senior options strategist at  WhatsTrading.com , a New York-based
provider of options-market analysis. “They’re taking fresh
positions in the October $35 calls as a cheap way to play the
stock.”  
 Expedia reports second-quarter results July 29.
