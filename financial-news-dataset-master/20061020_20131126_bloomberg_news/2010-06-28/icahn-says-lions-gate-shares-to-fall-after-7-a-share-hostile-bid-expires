             Investor  Carl Icahn  said  Lions Gate
Entertainment Corp.  will drop below his $7-a-share offer price
once his hostile tender for the independent film and television
studio expires.  
 The bid won’t be extended again when it expires on June 30,
Icahn said today in a statement. He’s the studio’s largest
shareholder, with a 32 percent stake.  
 Icahn, 74, has been battling for control of Lions Gate,
distributor of the “Saw” horror films, since February. He has
criticized the company for overspending and attributed the
stock’s gain in recent weeks to his offer and Lions Gate’s
inclusion in the Russell 2000 Index last week.  
 “The shareholders and I really have no conflict with this
tender,” Icahn said in an interview. “I am buying stock to
basically take control of the company with long-term objectives.
If the shareholder sells me stock at $7, I believe he will have
ample opportunity to buy it back at a cheaper price if he wishes
to, which is OK with me.”  
 Lions Gate has gained 33 percent since Feb. 16, when Icahn
offered to buy the company, initially for $6 a share.  The stock 
jumped 4 percent to $7.27 on June 25, when the company joined
the Russell 2000. Icahn said the gain was driven by
institutional investors, and those large purchases have ended.  
 Financial Position  
 In his statement, Icahn cited Lions Gate’s fiscal 2010
operating profit and cash flow as evidence that the company’s
 financial position  has declined. The studio said in a statement
that the numbers he used were inaccurate.  
 “Continued misstatements and inaccuracies shouldn’t
distract our shareholders from the simple truth that our
financial performance is strong, our momentum is growing and our
direction is clear,” the company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Lions Gate, run from Santa Monica, California, dropped 26
cents, or 3.6 percent, to $7.01 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  
 The company has held merger talks with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
Inc., a person with knowledge of the situation said last week.
No offer has been made and Lions Gate won’t move ahead without
backing from Icahn, the person said.  
 Icahn said in the interview today that the company
shouldn’t consider acquisitions before lowering debt and
overhead costs.  
 “You’ve got to clean up your own house,” he said.
