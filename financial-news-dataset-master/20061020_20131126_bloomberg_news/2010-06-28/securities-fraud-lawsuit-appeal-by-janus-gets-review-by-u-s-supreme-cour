             The  U.S. Supreme Court  agreed to use
an appeal involving fund manager  Janus Capital Group Inc . to
consider placing new restrictions on shareholder fraud lawsuits.  
 The justices will review a federal appeals court decision
letting shareholders sue Janus and a subsidiary for helping
produce allegedly misleading prospectuses for Janus mutual
funds. Janus contends that the funds are separate legal entities
and that neither the parent company nor the subsidiary were
responsible for the prospectuses.  
 The case will be a follow-up to a 2008 Supreme Court
decision that restricted securities suits against a company’s
banks and business partners.  
 The latest fight stems from allegations that the Janus
funds allowed preferred clients to engage in “market timing,”
a practice of making frequent, short-term trades at the expense
of other investors. Denver-based Janus agreed in 2004 to pay
$326 million to settle claims by state and federal regulators.  
 The prospectuses said the funds had taken steps to deter
market timing. In the lawsuit, Janus shareholders say those
assurances were revealed to be false in 2003 when New York
officials filed a complaint against the company, causing its
share price to fall.  
 The justices agreed to take up the case against the advice
of the Obama administration, which urged rejection of the Janus
appeal. The court will hear arguments and rule during the nine-
month term that starts in October.  
 The case is Janus Capital Group v. First Derivative
Traders, 09-525.
