             The Bundesbank, Germany’s central
bank, and financial regulator BaFin plan to meet with officials
from the country’s largest lenders to discuss stress tests, said
four people with knowledge of the matter.  
 The meeting will take place on June 30, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the information is
private.  Deutsche Bank AG , Commerzbank AG and the largest state-
owned lenders, known as Landesbanken, will take part in the
meeting, two of the people said.  
 European Union leaders pledged on June 17 to disclose the
results of tests by the end of July showing how banks would
perform under scenarios such as slower-than-forecast economic
growth. Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  told German lawmakers
that tests on European banks may be extended to 100 lenders,
said  Hans Michelbach , the deputy finance spokesman in parliament
for Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democratic bloc.  
 Lawmakers from parliament’s Finance Committee met with
Weber in Frankfurt on June 25, when he told them that the German
banking industry is, on the whole, stabilizing, said Michelbach,
who attended the meeting. The lawmakers also met separately with
representatives of the European Central Bank, he said.  
 Bundesbank, BaFin and the banks will discuss topics
including the criteria, timing and number of participants, as
well as how the results of the stress tests will be published,
one of the people said. A Bundesbank official in Frankfurt
declined to comment.  
 The planned meeting between the Bundesbank and German
banking officials was reported earlier today by the Financial
Times Deutschland.
