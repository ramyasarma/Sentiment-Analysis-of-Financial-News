             Elections in  Somaliland  met
international standards, said a foreign observer mission that
monitored the vote in the breakaway region of northwestern
 Somalia .  
 The June 26 vote was “a free and fair expression of the
popular will of the Somaliland people,” Steve Kibble, joint
coordinator for the team led by  Progressio , a London-based
development agency, told reporters today in the capital,
Hargeisa.  
 The election in one of the few peaceful and democratic
territories in the Horn of Africa was delayed for two years
because of wrangling over voter registration. President Dahir
Riyale Kahin of the United Peoples’ Democratic Party faced
challenges from Ahmed Mahmoud Silanyo of the Kulmiye party and
Faisal Ali Warabe from the Justice and Welfare Party.  
 Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991,
after the fall of former dictator  Mohammed Siad Barre . No
sovereign state has recognized Somaliland as an independent
nation.  
 The vote will help Somaliland “get international
recognition and investment,” Richard Williamson, a former U.S.
presidential envoy to Sudan and ambassador to the United
Nations, said at the weekend.  
 Riyale became president of the former British colony in
1992 and won election to the post in 2003, after his party
defeated the opposition Kulmiye party by 80 votes.  
 The June 26 vote was delayed until this month because of
security concerns and registration problems. Preliminary results
are expected later this week.
