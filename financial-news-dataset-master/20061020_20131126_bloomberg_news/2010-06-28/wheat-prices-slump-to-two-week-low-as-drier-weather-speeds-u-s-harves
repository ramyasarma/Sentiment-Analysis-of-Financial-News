             Wheat futures fell to a two-week low
on speculation that dry conditions will allow farmers to speed
up the harvest in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  
 The dry weather will spread this week from Ohio to the
largest winter-wheat producers, Kansas and Oklahoma. As of June
20, 17 percent of the winter-wheat crop was harvested, up from
15 percent a year earlier, according to a U.S. Department of
Agriculture  report . The price has dropped 17 percent in the past
year.  
 “If we get six or seven days of nice weather, we’ll get
some cut this week,” said  Jerod Leman , a broker at Wellington
Commodities in Carmel, Indiana. “There’s some harvest pressure
coming from Ohio, but mostly” from Kansas and Oklahoma, he
said.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 6 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $4.65 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price earlier declined to $4.595, the lowest level for the most-
active contract since June 14. The commodity has dropped 14
percent this year.  
 The price also declined on slack demand for U.S. supplies
as importers turn to countries in the Black Sea region. Egypt,
the world’s biggest buyer, on June 26 said it purchased 120,000
metric tons of Russian wheat for $165 a ton. U.S. supplies at
ports near New Orleans sold for $186 a ton on June 25.  
 “There’s still no demand out there that I know of, and
that is an issue,” Leman said. “If we could get some demand,
that could pop us up pretty good, but I don’t see any demand
coming in.”  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
