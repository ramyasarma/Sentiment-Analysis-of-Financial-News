             Hungary’s forint strengthened the
most in intraday trading in a week after Group of 20 leaders
endorsed targets to cut budget deficits, easing concern that one
or more European governments may default.  
 The forint snapped four days of declines to lead gains in
emerging Europe currencies, appreciating 0.6 percent to 282.81
per euro as of 9:15 a.m. in Budapest.  
 Developing-nation stocks jumped for the first time in five
trading days as advanced economies pledged to at least halve
deficits by 2013 to avoid more bailouts after the European Union
and International Monetary Fund had to extend a rescue loan of
110 billion-euros ($135 billion) to Greece. About 60 percent of
the exports of Hungary, which itself received a 20 billion-euro
emergency IMF loan in 2008, go to the euro region.  
 “We find the pragmatic G20 statement as net supportive for
the region” as “the main risks to growth and financial
stability to the central and eastern European countries emanate
from the developments of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe,”
UniCredit SpA analysts wrote in a report to clients today.  
 Poland’s zloty appreciated 0.3 percent to 4.1037 per euro
and the Czech koruna added 0.1 percent to 25.733. The Romanian
leu declined 0.5 percent.
