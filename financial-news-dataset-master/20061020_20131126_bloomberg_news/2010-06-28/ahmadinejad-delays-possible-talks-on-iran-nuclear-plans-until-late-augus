             Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said possible talks with the world powers on his
country’s atomic program won’t take place until late August and
must be preceded by a change in their stance on what he said was
Israel’s nuclear-arms program.  
 Ahmadinejad said the basis for the talks would be a
proposed fuel-swap agreement brokered by Turkey and Brazil under
which Iran would exchange about half of its low-enriched uranium
for more highly enriched imported uranium in a form that can
only be used in a Tehran medical-research reactor. Ahmadinejad
spoke today in a televised news conference.  
 The United Nations Security Council left open the
possibility of diplomatic talks to resolve the impasse over
Iran’s nuclear program after imposing a fourth set of sanctions
on the country on June 9. Iran says its atomic work is for
civilian purposes such as power generation and has rebuffed
Security Council demands to suspend uranium enrichment.  
 Congress imposed U.S. sanctions last week, punishing
companies that sell gasoline to Iran and blocking banks that do
business with the country from using the U.S. financial system.  
 Ahmadinejad said the sanctions will benefit Iran’s economy.
Iran can increase domestic production of gasoline by 30 million
liters (8 million gallons) a week and the Iranian people can cut
their consumption by half, he said.  
 Oil Price  
 The Iranian president, whose country is the No. 2 producer
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said crude
prices below $65 to $70 a barrel mean production isn’t
worthwhile for any nation. Oil for August delivery dropped as
much as 84 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $78.02 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange today on speculation that Tropical
Storm Alex will miss oil-producing areas in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Group of Eight leaders said Israel may decide to take
action against Iran out of concern that it is building nuclear
weapons, Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said June 26.  
 Since “Iran is not guaranteeing a peaceful production of
nuclear power, the members of the G-8 are worried, and believe
absolutely that Israel will probably react preemptively,”
Berlusconi said.  
 Israel’s policy for decades has been neither to confirm nor
deny whether it possesses nuclear weapons. Israel has refused to
open its nuclear facility in Dimona to UN inspectors. It says
the site is a research facility.
