             A sale of 10-year Italian bonds
maturing in September 2020 is likely to go well today because
the bond is trading “special” in the repurchase market,
according to Barclays Capital.  
 The auction may attract strong demand even after it became
more expensive since the last sale of the securities, Marek
Sasura, a fixed-income strategist at Barclays in London, wrote
in a research report today.  
 A bond is deemed to be special in the repo market if the
rates that dealers are prepared to pay to borrow it are
significantly more than they would for general collateral.  
 Italy plans to sell up to 3.5 billion euros of 4 percent
2020 bonds by 10 a.m. London time today.
