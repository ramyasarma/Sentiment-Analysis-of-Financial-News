             Italy faced weaker demand today at a
sale of 3- and 10-year bonds worth 7 billion euros ($8.65
billion), pushing yields on its traded debt higher.  
 The government auctioned 3.5 billion euros of securities
maturing in 2020 with investors bidding 1.29 times the amount of
10-year debt on offer, that’s down from the 1.37 times at the
May 28 sale. Italy also sold 3.5 billion euros of three-year
bonds with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.39 times, lower than the
1.52 times at the previous sale.  
 “At first sight, there are low bid-to-cover ratios,”
 Wilson Chin , a fixed-income strategist at  ING Groep NV  in
Amsterdam said in an e-mailed message. “The most important
thing and positive for the market is the fact that the auctions
are done and at the maximum amounts.”  
 Italy sold the 10-year debt today to yield 4.09 percent
compared with 4.07 percent at the May sale. The three-year bond
was priced to yield 2.33 percent, down from 2.35 percent at the
May auction.  
 The yield premium, or  spread , that investors demand to buy
 Italian 10-year bonds  over comparable  German bunds , the European
benchmark, widened by 10 basis points to 156 basis points as the
yield on Italy’s 10-year bond gained the same amount to 4.19
percent.  
 Last month the government led by Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  passed spending cuts worth 24.9 billion euros ($30.15
billon) aimed at cutting Italy’s deficit to 2.7 percent of  gross
domestic product  in 2012. The $2.1 trillion economy has the Euro
region’s largest public debt at 115.8 percent of GDP and must
finance more than 150 billion euros in maturing bonds this year.
