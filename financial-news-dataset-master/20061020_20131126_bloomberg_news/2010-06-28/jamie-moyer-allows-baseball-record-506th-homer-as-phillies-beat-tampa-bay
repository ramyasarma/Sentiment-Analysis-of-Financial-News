             Jamie Moyer  allowed the record 506th
home run of his Major League Baseball career in pitching the
Philadelphia Phillies to an 11-2 win over Toronto.  
 Moyer, in his 24th season and fifth with the Phillies,
surpassed Hall of Fame pitcher  Robin Roberts  last night when he
gave up a two-run homer to  Vernon Wells  during the third inning
at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia.  
 Moyer and Roberts are the only pitchers in major-league
history to allow more than 500 homers, with Hall of Famer  Fergie Jenkins  third on baseball’s  all-time list  with 484. The Phillies
retrieved the milestone baseball, according to  MLB.com , though
Moyer said previously he’d probably give it to his dog or one of
his kids.  
 The 47-year-old Moyer allowed two runs on six hits over
seven innings against the Blue Jays last night to improve his
record to 9-6 on the season. He also became the 40th pitcher in
baseball to throw more than 4,000 innings.  
 Moyer is the oldest active major leaguer and only nine
players in history have had  longer careers.  He made his debut on
June 16, 1986, about two weeks before the birth of Toronto
pitcher  Brett Cecil , who started last night for the Blue Jays.
