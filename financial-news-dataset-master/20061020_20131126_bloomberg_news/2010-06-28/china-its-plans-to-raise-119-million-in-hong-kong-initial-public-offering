             China ITS (Holdings) Co. , part-owned
by Temasek Holdings Pte and Intel Capital, and shareholders may
raise as much as HK$923.7 million ($119 million) from a Hong
Kong initial public offering, according to a share sale document
sent to fund managers today.  
 Beijing-based ITS and shareholders will sell a combined
236.84 million shares, or a 15 percent stake, at HK$2.85 to
HK$3.90 each, said the document. About 84 percent of the shares
are newly issued by the company, and the rest are sold by
shareholders including CCBI Asset Management and Baring Private
Equity Asia, it added.  
 Two of its pre-IPO investors will buy more shares in the
share sale as corporate investors who agree not to sell their
holdings for six months, the e-mail says.  Temasek , the state-
owned investment company in Singapore, will buy $11.5 million
worth of shares in the IPO and NWS Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong
will buy another $5 million.  
 Other pre-IPO investors in the company include GE Capital
and Intel Capital, it added.  
 Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch & Co. unit, CCB
International (Holdings) Ltd. and Macquarie Group Ltd. are
managing the sale, said the document.  
 The company, which provides information technology for 
transportation infrastructure projects, is raising money
for acquisitions, to replenish its working capital and for 
research and development, the e-mail said.  
 It began taking orders for the IPO today and will start
trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange July 15, the e-mail said.
