             The volume of energy futures traded
may decline if central clearing is made mandatory, the  European
Federation of Energy Traders  said.  
 The European Commission this month  proposed  that trading
derivative contracts be cleared through a central counterparty
that acts between the buyer and seller as a way of reducing
credit risks. Energy futures may be seen as a type of derivative
contract.  
 A move to central clearing “would hurt liquidity” in the
energy markets, Cemil Altin, chairman of EFET gas committee’s
project group transparency and head of regulation at EDF
Trading, said today at a press briefing in London.  
 Imposing the use of a central counterparty “would lead to
a new risk of firms trading less or exiting the market” because
of higher trading costs, he said.
