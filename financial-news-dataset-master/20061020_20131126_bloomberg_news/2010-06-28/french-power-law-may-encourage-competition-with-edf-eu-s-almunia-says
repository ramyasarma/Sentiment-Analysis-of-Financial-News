             A proposed French power law may
solve potential competition problems, enabling more companies to
compete with Electricite de France SA, European Union antitrust
commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in prepared remarks for a
conference in Madrid today.  
 “The problems identified by the Commission can be solved
by implementing the proposed reform of the electricity market by
the French Government announced in September of 2009 and now
being debated in Parliament,” said Almunia.  
 EDF , will be forced to sell at regulated prices for a
significant proportion of its production of nuclear base to
other retail electric providers, Almunia said.  
 The planned changes “should also encourage EDF’s
competitors to develop a strong customer base in France and
invest in developing their own generating capacity,” said the
commissioner.
