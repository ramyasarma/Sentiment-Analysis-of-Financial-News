             Eisai Co.  plans to  hire  about 100
people for a research and development center in India that will
give the drugmaker its first laboratory in Asia outside Japan.  
 The facility, estimated to cost about $50 million, will be
located in the eastern city of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh
state, said Kozo Akasaka, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Eisai, in
a telephone interview today. It will employ about 20 scientists,
he said.  
 Eisai, maker of Aricept, the world’s best-selling
Alzheimer’s disease treatment, aims to speed the development of
medications for the Indian market as well as produce new ones
for the global market, Akasaka said. Plans to open an R&D center
were reported June 26 in India’s Financial Express newspaper.  
 India’s domestic pharmaceutical industry, worth about $11
billion in the year ended March 2009, will expand to about $30
billion by 2020, accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said
in an April report.  
 Eisai  gained  1.2 percent to 3,035 yen on the Tokyo stock
exchange, the highest close since June 3, while the benchmark
 Topix  index fell 0.8 percent.
