             Colombian police have been tapping
the telephones of Ecuador’s President  Rafael Correa  and
government and military officials since 2008, El Universo
reported, citing an unidentified Colombian intelligence officer.  
 Colombian President  Alvaro Uribe  and incoming President
 Juan Manuel Santos  have been briefed at least three times on the
operation, which began in the aftermath of a Colombian raid on a
rebel base camp inside Ecuador in March 2008, the Guayaquil-
based  newspaper  said today, citing the officer.  
 Ecuador broke off diplomatic relations with Colombia after
the attack, which killed at least 23 members of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC,
including its second-in-command  Raul Reyes . Ecuadorean
prosecutors in April issued an arrest warrant for Santos,
defense minister at the time of the attack, for his role in the
bombing.  
 Ecuador’s National Communications Secretary declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News, a press officer who
can’t be named under ministry policy said today by telephone.
The office of Colombia’s National Press Secretary Cesar
Velasquez declined to comment when contacted by telephone and
Velasquez didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed questions.
