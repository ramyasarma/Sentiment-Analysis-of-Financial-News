             The rate banks say they charge each
other for three-month loans in dollars in London was little
changed, according to the British Bankers’ Association.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
was at 0.533 percent today, the BBA said. The rate was 0.535
percent at the end of last week. The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a
gauge of banks’ reluctance to lend, was little changed at 33.3
basis points as of 11:44 a.m. in London.
