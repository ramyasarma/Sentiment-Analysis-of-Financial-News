             The Romanian leu depreciated to its
weakest intraday level on record against the euro after the
opposition pledged to mount another no-confidence motion in
parliament, further complicating austerity plans aimed at
reviving a bailout loan.  
 The leu slid 2.1 percent to as low as 4.3685 per euro as of
4:52 p.m. in Bucharest. It was the weakest level since at least
February 1999 and the second-biggest loss among more than 170
world currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
