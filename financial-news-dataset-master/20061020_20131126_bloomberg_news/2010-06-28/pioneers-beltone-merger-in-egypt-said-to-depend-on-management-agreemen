             Pioneers Holding , Egypt’s second-
largest publicly traded securities brokerage, has yet to reach
an agreement with Beltone Financial on the management and
strategy of their merger, said a person close to the
transaction.  
 Negotiations are on-going, the person said. The merger was
to be concluded upon the completion of due diligence by the end
of May, according to a Beltone statement from March 14.  
 Osama Rashad, head of investor relations for Beltone,
declined to comment.  Khaled El Tayeb , a board member of
Pioneers, did not respond to calls on his mobile phone. The
merger has been delayed because of market volatility, Al Alam Al
Youm reported today, citing Pioneers board member Taha Al
Talbany.  
 Pioneers said in December it would issue Beltone investors
100 million shares valued at 700 million Egyptian pounds ($123
million), creating an investment bank with 29 billion pounds
under management.  
 Pioneers fell 1.8 percent to 3.8 pounds, the lowest in a
month at 1:15 p.m. in Cairo today, valuing the company at 1.9
billion pounds. The company’s stock has declined 43 percent
since announcing the merger in November. Beltone is privately
held.
