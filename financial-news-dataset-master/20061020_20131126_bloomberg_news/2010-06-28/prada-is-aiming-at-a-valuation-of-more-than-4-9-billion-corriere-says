              Prada SpA is aiming for a valuation
of over 4 billion euros ($4.95 billion), while bankers estimate
the Italian fashion label is worth between 3 billion euros and 4
billion euros, Corriere della Sera said,
without saying where it got the information.  
 Prada appointed Gianfranco Mattei as head of a committee
for the company’s listing two months ago, a position that had
been suspended previously, Corriere said. The Italian
company wants to boost retail sales from 65 percent to 75
percent within a “short” period, Corriere reported.
