             The future of  BP Plc  Chief Executive
Officer  Tony Hayward  wasn’t discussed during talks with Russia’s
Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin , an aide to the country’s top
energy official said.  
 Hayward and Sechin discussed  TNK-BP , the oil venture BP
owns with a group of billionaires, and  OAO Rosneft , in which it
owns a stake, according to the aide, who declined to be
identified in line with state policy. Sechin chairs Rosneft, the
largest oil producer in Russia. Hayward reiterated the company’s
commitment to Russia, the aide said.  
 Earlier today, Sechin had said that Hayward was planning to
resign and announce his successor, in comments that were
confirmed by an aide. Hayward’s failure to halt the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill has triggered speculation that he might be
forced out. BP denied that he was about to quit.  
 Hayward and Sechin also discussed BP’s efforts to contain
the oil leak and how to prevent future accidents, the aide said
by phone after today’s meeting in Moscow.  
 Sheila Williams , a spokeswoman for BP, earlier said that
Hayward has no plans to step down. She later declined to comment
on the content of the talks.  
 Hayward also plans to visit Moscow-based TNK-BP, which
accounts for about 25 percent of the London-based company’s
reserves and output, two people familiar with the matter told
Bloomberg. They declined to be identified because the visit is
confidential.  
 Rosneft Stake  
 BP pledged its 1.3 percent stake in Rosneft to banks to
raise funds for the costs of battling the spill, the Wall Street
Journal reported last week.  
 It bought $1 billion of shares in Rosneft’s initial public
offering in 2006 and has a joint venture with the Moscow-based
company to explore for oil and gas off Sakhalin Island, which is
north of Japan, as well as the Arctic.  
 BP has lost about 50 percent of its  market value  since the
April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig
that killed 11 crew members and caused the the spill. BP has
agreed to deposit $20 billion in an independent account to pay
for Gulf restoration and compensation claims. The direct costs
of the cleanup have reached $2.65 billion, BP said today.
