             The ruble climbed the most in a week
as oil topped $79 a barrel, boosting the outlook for the world’s
biggest energy exporter.  
 The Russian currency strengthened 0.4 percent against the
greenback to 30.9824 as of 10:16 a.m. in Moscow, its biggest
gain since June 21. The government’s benchmark sovereign dollar
bonds due April 2020 climbed, with the yield narrowing 1 basis
point to 5.47 percent.  
 Crude oil, Russia’s chief export, advanced as much as 0.7
percent to $79.38 per barrel as the dollar declined, boosting
demand for commodities. Emerging-market stocks rose for the
first time in five days, pushing the MSCI Emerging Markets Index
up 0.6 percent, after leaders from the Group of 20 nations
endorsed targets to cut deficits, helping to ease concerns of
defaults.  
 Investors pared bets that the ruble will weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.2051
per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of 31.2225 on
June 25. The contracts are a guide to expectations of currency
movements as they allow foreign investors and companies to fix
the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The ruble slid 0.2 percent against the euro, weakening for
a fourth day, to 38.3185. Those movements left the ruble 0.1
percent stronger at 34.2882 against the central bank’s  target 
currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
