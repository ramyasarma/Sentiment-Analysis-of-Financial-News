-- Consumer Spending in U.S. Probably Little Changed in May as Incomes Rose

             Consumer spending in the U.S. was
probably little changed in May for a second month as Americans
used wage gains to rebuild savings, economists said before a
report today.  
 Purchases rose 0.1 percent after no change the prior month,
according to the median forecast of 58 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Incomes  climbed 0.5 percent, the biggest
increase in a year, the survey also showed.  
 The spending pause may not persist as gains in payrolls,
longer workweeks and increasing pay are helping Americans gain
confidence in the recovery.  Federal Reserve  policy makers last
week pledged to keep interest rates low to ensure households
weather the fallout from the European debt crisis, unemployment
hovering near a 26-year high and tight credit.  
 “Consumer spending is still moving forward, but it’s not
leading the recovery,” said  Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist
at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. “Consumers
are now depending on growth in employment income to drive
spending.”  
 The Commerce Department’s report is due at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington. Spending projections ranged from a gain of 0.3
percent to a decline of 0.5 percent.  
 The report will probably show inflation subsiding. The
inflation gauge tied to spending patterns increased 1.8 percent
from May 2009, down from 2 percent in the 12 months through
April, economists forecast the report will show.  
 Inflation Ebbs  
 The Fed’s preferred price measure, which excludes food and
fuel, rose 0.1 percent in May from the prior month, matching
April’s increase, according to the survey.  
 The Fed last week said the labor market is “improving
gradually,” changing April’s assessment that it was “beginning
to improve.” Consumer spending still “remains constrained” by
joblessness and “tight credit,” it said.  
 Spending cooled last month as a housing tax credit and
incentives to buy energy-saving appliances ended. Sales at U.S.
retailers unexpectedly dropped in May for the first time in
eight months, the Commerce Department reported on June 11.  
 Purchases  fell 1.2 percent from April, the report showed.
The drop was led by a record 9.3 percent plunge in demand at
building-material stores that may have reflected the end of the
government incentives.  
 Discounters Outperform  
 Sales at 30 retail chains rose 2.7 percent in May from a
year earlier, less than the 2.9 percent forecast, Retail Metrics
said June 3. Discounters did better as Americans tried to
stretch their paychecks. Sales at  Costco Wholesale Corp ., the
largest U.S. warehouse club, rose 9 percent. Sales at BJ’s
Wholesale Club Inc. climbed 6.8 percent.  
 “Consumers are less cautious than they were previously,”
 Robert Niblock , chief executive officer at Lowe’s Cos., the
second-largest home-improvement chain, said in a June 23
teleconference. “But they still know that we’re still not out
of the woods yet.”  
 Retailer shares are little changed this year after giving
back earlier gains as concern over the European crisis
intensified. The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Retailing
Index climbed 0.7 percent so far this year after having been up
22 percent through April 26.  
 Consumer spending  grew at a 3 percent annual pace in the
first three months of 2010, less than previously estimated, the
Commerce Department said last week. The report showed the
economy grew 2.7 percent in the first quarter.  
 Economists surveyed this month projected purchases will
expand at a 3 percent rate in the April-to-June period and 2.6
percent in the second half of the year.
