             Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
said today he welcomed the vote on a new constitution in
Kyrgyzstan, questioning whether a parliamentary republic will
prevent extremist forces coming to power.  
 Kyrgyzstan held a referendum today on whether to shift the
former Soviet republic to a parliamentary system of government
from presidential rule. Medvedev said he is concerned the new
status may bring on endless problems, parliamentary shake-ups
and uncontrolled transfer of authority.  
 “I do not see very well how the model of parliamentary
republic would work in Kyrgyzstan,” Medvedev told reporters in
Toronto where he attended a Group of 20 summit. “Would it not,
in the end, help extremist forces come to power?”  
 Kyrgyzstan’s voters backed the new constitution, Agence
France-Presse reported, citing results from 41 percent of
districts where 89.9 percent of the electorate approved the
change. The referendum took place after ethnic violence earlier
this month that resulted in the deaths of at least 251 people
and forced 400,000 people to flee their homes.  
 The clashes involved ethnic Kyrgyz residents and Uzbeks who
make up about 14 percent of Kyrgyzstan’s population of 5.3
million people.  
 Medvedev said that Kyrgyzstan in the current state may end
up falling apart and that a strong and well organized power is
needed to avoid such scenarios.  
 Roza Otunbayeva  leads the country as interim president
after the overthrow of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev in April.
