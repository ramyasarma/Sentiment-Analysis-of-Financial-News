             Works by  Yves Klein ,  Lucio Fontana 
and  Gerhard Richter  sold at an auction in London as buyers chose
classic 1960s works and declined to pay high asking prices.  
 The three top lots sold within estimates at a  Sotheby’s 
sale last night that raised a total of 41.1 million pounds ($62
million). Dealers said the market recovery for contemporary art
was taking a breath after the biggest slump since 1990.  
 “The estimates were not so tempting,” said the
Dusseldorf-based art adviser Jorg-Michael Bertz. “They’ve been
adjusted to the new level too quickly. Sotheby’s did sell
things, though, and they will react at the next series of
auctions.”  
 Expectations were raised by improved sales earlier this
month at the Art Basel fair in Switzerland. Still, continuing
uncertainty in the wider economy has made collectors wary about
high-value works. Last week at  Christie’s International , a
Claude Monet water lily painting valued at 30 million pounds
failed to sell.  
 Sotheby’s total with fees was achieved against a low
estimate of 38.3 million pounds, based on hammer prices. Eighty-
three percent of the 53 lots found buyers. Less than a third of
the successful lots sold for hammer prices above forecasts.  
 Following the financial crisis -- and a 50 percent fall in
the prices of some fashionable contemporary names -- the
auctions have become increasingly reliant on classic postwar
works.  
 At Sotheby’s, a blue sponge relief by Klein, titled
“RE49,” and a green Fontana “La Fine di Dio” (End of God)
canvas were the most highly valued works, both carrying low
estimates of 4.5 million pounds.  
 UniCredit’s Sale  
 The 1961 Klein, entered from the collection of HVB Group,
the German banking unit of UniCredit SpA, was bought by one of
three telephone bidders for 6.2 million pounds. In February,
buyers spent more than 16 million pounds on works by Klein at
London auctions.  
 The 1963 egg-shaped Fontana had appeared at a sale in
London in February 2001, when it fetched 465,750 pounds at
Christie’s. On this occasion, it raised 4.7 million pounds from
another telephone bidder.  
 “There are too many Kleins and Fontanas in these
auctions,” Bertz said. “We need a rest from them.”  
 A 1964 Richter painting, “Neger (Nuba),” showing members
of a tribe from Sudan, sold to a single telephone bid of 3.7
million pounds against a low estimate of 3.5 million pounds. The
work had been bought by its seller for 298,500 pounds at
Sotheby’s in 1995.  
 Owners attempting to sell works bought more recently on the
market were less successful.  
 Peter Doig’s  1995 to 1996 mountain landscape, “White
Creep,” was offered with a low estimate of 1.4 million pounds,
having been bought for that price by the seller at Sotheby’s in
February 2008. It failed to attract a bid.  
 Prince Nurse  
 Richard Prince’s  2002 painting “Millionaire Nurse”
reappeared at Sotheby’s after being sold for $4.7 million in New
York in May 2008. Here in London it was knocked down to a lone
telephone bid of 2.2 million pounds.  
 Much presale publicity had been generated by the presence
of Bharti Kher’s 2006 life-size sculpture of a dying elephant,
“The Skin Speaks a Language Not Its Own.” One of four unique
variants by the Indian artist -- another is owned by the U.K.
collector  Frank Cohen  -- it sold for a record 993,250 pounds
against a low estimate of 700,000 pounds to another phone
bidder.  
 Despite the subdued atmosphere in a less than full
saleroom, Sotheby’s achieved an average price of 933,905 pounds
for successful lots. Last year, at a sale that mustered 25.5
million pounds from 40 lots, the average was 690,000 pounds.  
 “The contemporary art market has leveled,” the London-
based dealer Gerard Faggionato said in an interview. “There
were still some good prices: There’s no doubt where we stand.”
