                  June 28 (Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. ,  Honda Motor Co. 
and  Nissan Motor Co . increased global vehicle production in May
as Japan’s largest carmakers benefited from rising demand in
Asia and the U.S.  
 Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker, boosted output 28
percent from a year earlier to 568,004 vehicles last month, the
company said in a statement today. Exports at the Toyota City,
Japan-based carmaker rose 15 percent to 115,280 vehicles.  
 Demand for vehicles recovered in the  U.S.  and Japan from a
year earlier, when carmakers scaled back output to reduce
inventory amid a recession. Car sales also continued climbing in
 China , the world’s largest auto market, where industrywide
deliveries of passenger cars, trucks and buses rose 26 percent
in May to 885,800.  
 “The North American market will continue to recover in the
second half of this year, while the emerging markets such as
India, China and Brazil will continue to grow,” said  Satoru Takada , an analyst in Tokyo at TIW Inc. “It will probably take
two or three years for global demand to recover” to the levels
prior to the global recession, he said.  
 Output at Honda, Japan’s second-largest automaker,
increased 43 percent to 278,543 vehicles, the Tokyo-based
company said in a statement today. Nissan, third by unit sales
among Japan’s automakers, said production of its cars and light
trucks rose 42 percent to 309,287 units.  
 Toyota fell 1.3 percent to 3,095 yen as of 2:40 p.m. in
Tokyo. Honda gained 0.3 percent and Nissan lost 0.3 percent.  
 China Production, Strikes  
 Auto sales in the U.S. jumped 19 percent last month as
 consumer confidence  rose to the highest level since March 2008,
based on the Conference Board’s index. Toyota’s deliveries in
the country rose 6.7 percent while Honda’s increased 19 percent
and Nissan’s climbed 24 percent.  
 Toyota’s production in China rose 18 percent last month,
while Honda’s output in the country dropped 16 percent. Honda
shut down all four of its car plants in China on May 26 after
workers at a parts-making unit went on strike demanding a pay
raise. Production resumed partially from May 31.  
 At least eight strikes since the middle of May have forced
suppliers to Toyota, Honda and Nissan to raise wages in China,
increasing their costs.
