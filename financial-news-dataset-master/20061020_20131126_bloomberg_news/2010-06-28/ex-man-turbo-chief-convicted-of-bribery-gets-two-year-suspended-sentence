             The former top executive at a  MAN SE 
unit was convicted of bribery, receiving a two-year suspended
prison sentence and an order to pay 100,000 euros ($123,350) to
charities.  
 The former chief executive of MAN Turbo AG, identified only
as Heinz Juergen M., authorized more than 9 million euros in
bribes to win orders tied to a gas pipeline in Kazakhstan, the
Munich Regional Court said in an e-mailed statement today. The
sentence was part of an agreement between court, defense and
prosecution, according to the statement.  
 “The court took into account the full cooperation of the
accused right from the beginning,” the judges said. “It
warrants particular notice that he took full responsibility and
didn’t try to put the blame on his subordinates.”  
 MAN SE, Europe’s third-largest truckmaker which is 29.9
percent owned by  Volkswagen AG , last year agreed to pay 150.6
million euros in fines to resolve an investigation into alleged
bribes paid by its truck and turbo units.  
 Thomas Elsner , attorney for Heinz Juergen M., 66, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.  
 The bribes were paid between October 2005 and May 2008. The
former executive was convicted of bribing employees of a private
company and not of bribing a government official, according to
the court. Bribes to government officials carry a sentence of as
many as five years under German law.
