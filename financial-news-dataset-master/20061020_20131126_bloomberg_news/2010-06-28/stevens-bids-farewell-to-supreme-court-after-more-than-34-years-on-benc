             John Paul Stevens , the second
longest-serving-justice in Supreme Court history, bid farewell
to his colleagues today with customary modesty, after more than
34 years on the bench.  
 “If I have overstayed my welcome, it is because this is
such a unique and wonderful job,” Stevens, 90, told the other
justices and court staff in his parting remarks.  
 Solicitor General  Elena Kagan , nominated by President
 Barack Obama  to replace Stevens on the court, began her
confirmation hearings today before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.  
 When Stevens took a seat among the justices this morning
he was greeted by those in attendance, including male and
female staff and even some reporters, who marked his departure
by wearing bow ties, the justice’s signature fashion accessory.  
 Chief Justice  John Roberts  read a letter for Stevens,
whose retirement is effective tomorrow, praising what he called
his “unaffected decency and resolute commitment to justice.”
