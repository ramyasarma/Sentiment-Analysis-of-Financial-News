             U.S. stocks erased gains as energy
producers declined after oil retreated from a seven-week high,
overshadowing gains in tobacco and phone companies.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,075.84 at 3:30 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 3.97 points, or less than 0.1 percent,
to 10,147.78 after climbing as much as 58 points earlier.
