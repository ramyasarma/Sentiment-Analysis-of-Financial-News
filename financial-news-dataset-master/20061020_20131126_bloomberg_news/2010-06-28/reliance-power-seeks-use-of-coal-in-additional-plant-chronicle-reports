             Reliance Power Ltd. is seeking the
government’s approval to use surplus coal from a mine allotted
to it for a power plant in Jharkhand state at other projects,
the Financial Chronicle reported, without saying where it got
the information.  
 Reliance wants to use about 300 million tons of surplus
coal from the mines meant for use at a planned 4,000 megawatt
power plant at projects it hasn’t specified, according to the
report. That amount of coal can help generate 1,300 megawatt of
electricity, the newspaper said.
