             Copper traded near the highest level
in four weeks as declines in inventories improved demand
prospects of the industrial metal.  
 Three-month delivery copper rose as much as 1 percent to
$6,840.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded
at $6,777 at 3:37 p.m. in Shanghai. The metal rose to $6,875 a
ton on June 25, the highest price since June 1. Lead advanced as
much as 1.9 percent to $1,850 a ton and nickel jumped as much as
1.8 percent to $20,100 a ton, respectively.  
 Shanghai copper stockpiles decreased by the most in 11
months last week, to the lowest level since the week ended Feb.
19. Inventories monitored by the LME have declined 9.6 percent
this year and cancelled warrants, or the metal earmarked for
delivery, have increased to the highest level since March. China
is the world’s largest copper user.  
 “Reductions in London and Shanghai inventories provided
support for copper prices,” Yuan Guangshan, an analyst at
Zhongcai Futures Co. said from Shanghai today. “Whether the
declines can be sustained is a question and our answer is
probably no.”  
 Copper posted the biggest weekly gain in four months last
week as  the dollar  weakened, boosting demand for commodities.
The metal, used in wires and pipes, is still almost 16 percent
off an April peak on concerns that the global economic recovery
may slow, hurting demand.  
 ‘Prices Supported’  
 Group of 20 leaders responded to the European debt crisis
with deficit-reduction targets and agreed to pursue higher
capital requirements for banks once economic recoveries take
hold. Leaders said nations can move at their own pace and also
pledged to fulfill existing stimulus plans.  
 “While mixed macro data from OECD economies may continue
to tug on sentiment in the coming weeks, we expect the
continuation of broadly positive data flow from key developing
economies to keep prices supported,”  Hussein Allidina , head of
commodity research with Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note today,
referring to base metals.  
 Copper for September delivery in Shanghai jumped as much as
2.5 percent to 54,490 yuan ($8,021) a ton and closed at 53,960
yuan. Shanghai zinc climbed as much as 3.3 percent to 15,510
yuan and aluminum increased as much as 1.4 percent to 15,040
yuan.  
 Aluminum in London declined 0.3 percent to $1,991 a ton,
zinc fell 0.2 percent to $1,869.50 a ton, and tin was little
changed at $18,123 a ton.
