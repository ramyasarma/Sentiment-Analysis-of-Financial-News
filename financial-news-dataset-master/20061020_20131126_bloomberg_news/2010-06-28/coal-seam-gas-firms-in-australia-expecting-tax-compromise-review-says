             The coal-seam gas industry in
Australia is confident it won compromises to the government’s
proposed mining tax, which may see it operate under a similar
model to the petroleum resources rent levy, the Australian
Financial Review reported, without saying where it got the
information. The industry is seeking a resolution so that final
investment decisions can be made on A$50 billion of planned
liquefied natural gas projects in Queensland state, according to
the Review.
