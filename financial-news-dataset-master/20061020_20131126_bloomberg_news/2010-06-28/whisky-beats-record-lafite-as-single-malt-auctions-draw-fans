             Peter Silver, a collector of single-
malt whisky, nibbled on cheese and sipped water as bidders
pushed up the price of a bottle of  Macallan  50-Year-Old
Anniversary Malt to $9,250, almost double the record price paid
for Chateau Lafite.  
 Silver, dentist to jazz musician  Wynton Marsalis  and member
of the international tasting group Malt Maniacs, was one of
three dozen fans at the Bonhams whisky auction in New York on
June 22, which also took telephone bids from as far afield as
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Europe.  
 “Prices are fair, and bottles are selling for what they’re
worth,’’ said Silver, who scooped up an obscure Braes of
Glenlivet 18-year-old 1979 bottling for a more modest $119.  
 The Macallan $9,250 bid compares with the sale last month
at Zachys of a case of in-demand 1982 Chateau Lafite for
$58,080, or $4,840 a bottle.  
 Still, you can get into the whisky-bidding game for a whole
lot less. Against a background of ancient maps and a glass case
with first editions of  Joseph Heller ’s “Catch-22’’ and Dr.
Seuss’s “The Cat in the Hat,’’ auctioneer Rupert Banner fielded
hundreds of bids for the 554 lots. Most went for $200 to $800.  
 “Well over 50 percent of them went to private
individuals,’’ said Bonhams whisky specialist Martin Green later
in a phone call. “We’re seeing more and more new buyers.’’ What
they’re most interested in is single malts, whiskies that come
from a single distillery -- in contrast to blends like Johnnie
Walker that come from two or more.  
 New Collectors  
 At least two newbie collectors walked out happy. A 24-year-
old TV producer (“no names, please’’) in polka-dotted bowtie,
seersucker trousers and blazer bought a 2-bottle lot of 15-year-
old Macallan and Macallan 1990 for $214, bringing his collection
to 17 bottles. “I’m not old enough to be a connoisseur,’’ he
joked.  
 Adam Friend, a 37-year-old strategy consultant for private-
equity companies, bid on several lots before finally winning two
-- a bottle of  Bruichladdich  30-year-old 1972 and an Ardbeg 1998
-- both for below the low estimates. Also a wine collector, he
left beaming.  
 Scotland has hosted regular whisky sales for two decades,
but in New York, spirit auctions were banned after Prohibition
until 2007.  Christie’s International  rushed in that December
with a hoopla-filled sale of rare liquors and prices of the best
went into orbit. One New Yorker paid $54,000 for a single bottle
of 1926 Macallan.  
 Bonhams tested U.S. interest last December with a one-off
New York sale of whiskies from a famous 3,000-bottle single-
owner collection (the rest were sold in Edinburgh and Hong
Kong). Its success inspired them to announce twice-a-year
dedicated whisky sales in the city.  
 Cult Following  
 “Prices really began taking off last spring,’’ said Green.
Big distillery names with cult followings lead -- Macallan,
Dalmore, Bowmore, Springbank, Glenfiddich. “People are
investing as speculation, and if they want they can certainly
drink what they buy,’’ he said.  
 Whiskies have one virtue few wines can match. After you
uncork a wine, you need to consume it then. Opened whiskies can
be enjoyed for months, even years.  
 Green was still celebrating Bonhams June 16 Edinburgh
auction, where a bidder paid 25,200 pounds ($37,578) for a rare
Glenfiddich single malt distilled in 1937, one of 61 bottles
produced. When it was released in 2001 as part of a 10-bottle
batch, it sold for less than half that. Green said it’s still
drinkable, with a taste of toffee and toasted almonds.  
 Whisky Index  
 U.K.-based  Whisky magazine  recently added a Whisky Index
that tracks auction prices. The graph in the May issue shows a
sharp upward trajectory from May 2009, with prices more than
doubling.  
 The spirit is still a niche market compared to top quality
Bordeaux and Burgundy, the mainstays of wine auctions. In 2010,
wine prices, which plummeted after the collapse of  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.  in September 2008, have rebounded.  
 On May 21, Zachys had its most lucrative one-day sale since
the market peaked in 2007, while at Chicago’s Hart Davis Hart,
prices of 1986 Mouton-Rothschild were up 80 percent from the
beginning of 2010. Lafite also continues to pull in the bucks.  
 June’s New York auctions are more of the same. Sotheby’s
June 5 auction ($3,383,100) and Zachys’ two-day sale last week
($4,518,201) were solid, at 98 percent sold and first growths,
Ptrus and Domaine de la Romanee Conti going for high prices.
Lafite continues to bring in big bucks. Some of the most
staggering prices are being set in Hong Kong, where sales are
predicted to surpass New York this year.  
 Will whisky follow the same trend? One obstacle is the high
duty and taxes (100 percent) on spirits, which wasn’t removed as
it was for wine in 2008.  
 Even so, Hong Kong’s first whisky auction, held by  Bonhams 
last November, was 100 percent sold. I asked Green whether
whisky taxes might go the way of wine.  
 “It’s under discussion,’’ he said.  
 Better bid on those bottles of Old Glengargle while you
can.

                     554 lots of whisky were offered to a roomful of active bidders at Bonham's in New York.  The sale, the second all-whisky auction in the city, brought $200,890, with 76 percent sold. Phone and email bids came from as  far away as Taiwan and Hong Kong.
