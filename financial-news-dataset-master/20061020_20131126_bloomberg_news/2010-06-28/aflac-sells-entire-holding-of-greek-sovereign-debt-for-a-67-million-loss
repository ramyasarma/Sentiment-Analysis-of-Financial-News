             Aflac Inc. , the largest supplemental
health insurer, dumped all its Greek sovereign debt at a loss to
reduce the risk of further writedowns. The company advanced 2.7
percent in New York trading.  
 The sale will lower earnings by $67 million this quarter,
Columbus, Georgia-based Aflac said today in a statement. The
Greek holdings were valued at $270 million as of March 31.  
 Aflac stock has been pressured by concern the company would
have to write down securities tied to governments or banks in
Greece and Portugal, nations whose ratings have been cut because
of mounting debt. Aflac slipped 5.8 percent this year through
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with the 7.9
percent advance of the 24-company  KBW Insurance Index .  
 “It was prudent to trim our exposures to Eurozone
sovereign debt,” Chief Financial Officer  Kriss Cloninger  said
in the statement. “We will continue to assess the
creditworthiness of issuers in our portfolio and manage our
investments in a way that reflects our  risk tolerance  and the
objectives we’ve set for earnings growth.”  
 Aflac also lowered its exposure to hybrid debt by about
$725 million, or 8.4 percent, through two transactions, the
company said. In one case, Aflac exchanged a security of an
undisclosed European issuer for higher-rated senior debt. The
other deal was privately negotiated with a separate European
issuer, Aflac said. The transactions will add about $80 million
to earnings.  
 Profit Goals ‘Achievable’  
 The company’s goal of boosting operating earnings per share
by as much as 12 percent this year and in 2011, before the
impact of currency changes, are “achievable,” said Cloninger.
Aflac  gained  $1.19 to $44.78 at 4:15 p.m. in composite trading.  
 Aflac sells policies supplementing work and government-
sponsored health-insurance plans and gets most of its  revenue
from Japan . The company is counting on earnings from that
country to support capital as the firm’s investments backing
policies are pressured.  
 The cost of protecting Greek government debt from default
surged to a record last week on renewed investor concerns that
slowing economic growth means the country will struggle to tame
budget deficits. The price of credit-default swaps signaled the
expectation of a 68.5 percent chance the nation will default
within five years, CMA DataVision said.  
 Aflac had about $1 billion in Greek bank bonds and $750
million issued by Portuguese lenders, Chief Investment Officer
 Jerry Jeffery  said in an April conference call.
