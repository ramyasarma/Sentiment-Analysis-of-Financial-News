             Surging food prices may slow growth
in emerging economies and fan inflation, according to Russian
billionaire  Oleg Deripaska .  
 Rising food prices should be one of the major concerns for
investors in developing nations as they could stoke inflation,
Deripaska, chief executive officer of United Co. Rusal, the
world’s biggest producer of aluminum, said at a Renaissance
Capital conference in Moscow today. Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. Chairman
 Robert Friedland  said at the same event commodities “people
need,” such as water, food and copper, will outperform gold.  
 Global food production must rise 70 percent by 2050 as the
world population expands to 9.1 billion from about 6.8 billion
now, the United Nations’  Food and Agriculture Organization  says.  
 World population growth is expected to average 1.1 percent
a year to 2019, with 2 percent growth in Africa, the FAO and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation said in their annual
outlook report published earlier this month.  
 Average prices for wheat and coarse grains are estimated to
be 15 percent to 40 percent higher in the coming decade,
compared with the period from 1997 to 2006, they said.
