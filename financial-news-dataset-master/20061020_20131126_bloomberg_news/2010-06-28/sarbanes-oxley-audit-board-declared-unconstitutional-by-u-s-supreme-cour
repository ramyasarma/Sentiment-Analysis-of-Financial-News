             (Corrects in second paragraph to say that law can be fixed
by broadening SEC power.)  
 The  U.S. Supreme Court  ruled that
Congress violated the Constitution when it set up an auditing
board after the  Enron Corp.  and  WorldCom Inc.  collapses, saying
the panel was too insulated from presidential control.  
 The 5-4 decision stopped short of ordering the work of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to stop, instead
saying the Securities and Exchange Commission must have
unfettered power to fire the board’s members. The board was
established by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law.
