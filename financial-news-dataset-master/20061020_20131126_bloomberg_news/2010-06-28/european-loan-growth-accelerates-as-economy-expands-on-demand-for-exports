             Loans  to households and companies in
Europe grew at a faster annual pace in May as economic growth
accelerated.  
 Loans to the private sector rose 0.2 percent from a year
earlier after increasing 0.1 percent in April, the European
Central Bank in Frankfurt said today.  M3 money supply , which the
ECB uses as a gauge of future inflation, declined an annual 0.2
percent in May, the same as in the previous month.  
 A stronger global economy and a weaker euro are boosting
external demand for goods made in Europe. At the same time, a
sovereign debt crisis has prompted governments across the 16-
nation euro area to cut spending, threatening to undermine the
region’s recovery from its worst recession since World War II.  
 “Credit growth will remain significantly below 1 percent
in coming months,” said  Karsten Junius , a senior economist at
Dekabank in Frankfurt. “I’m skeptical about the breadth of the
economic recovery as developments in southern Europe are pretty
weak.”  
 In the  three months through  May, M3 fell 0.2 percent from
the same period a year earlier, the ECB said. M3 is the broadest
gauge of money supply and includes cash in circulation, some
forms of savings and money-market holdings. The annual rate of
M1 money-supply growth eased to 10.3 percent from 10.7 percent.
