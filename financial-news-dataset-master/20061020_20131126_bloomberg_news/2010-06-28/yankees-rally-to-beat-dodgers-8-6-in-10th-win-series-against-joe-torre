             The New York Yankees rallied for an
8-6 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers last night, scoring four
runs in the ninth inning to tie and then getting a two-run home
run in the 10th from  Robinson Cano .  
 The comeback in Los Angeles helped the Yankees win the
interleague series against the Dodgers and former manager  Joe Torre  two-games-to-one.  
 The Yankees trailed 6-2 entering the top of the ninth
inning and scored four runs off Dodgers reliever  Jonathan Broxton . Cano had a run-scoring double and rookie  Chad Huffman 
delivered a two-run single, both with one out.  
 Fellow rookie Colin Curtis, called up from the minor
leagues on June 21, followed with a groundout that scored  Curtis Granderson  with the tying run. Broxton had allowed three earned
runs in 33 appearances entering the game.  
 In the top of the 10th inning,  Mark Teixeira  led off with a
single. After  Alex Rodriguez  grounded out, Cano drilled a two-
run homer off Dodgers reliever  George Sherrill  into the left-
centerfield seats. Cano had been 0-for-11 against Sherrill
before that at-bat.  
 Mariano Rivera  pitched two scoreless innings to pick up the
victory for the Yankees, who are in first place in the American
League Eastern Division with a 47-28 record, two games ahead of
the Boston Red Sox.  
 The series marked the first meeting between the Yankees and
Dodgers since Torre left New York for Los Angeles in 2007. Torre
won four World Series titles in his 12 seasons as the Yankees’
manager.
