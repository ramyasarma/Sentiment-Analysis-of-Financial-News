             Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  will hold a news conference in Canberra today amid media
reports that her predecessor,  Kevin Rudd , will be excluded from
her new Cabinet.  
 Gillard will meet the press at 1:15 p.m. local time in the
courtyard of Parliament House, a statement from her office said
today.  
 The new prime minister may shut former leader Rudd out of
her Cabinet,
the Australian newspaper today said, citing Labor party sources.
Gillard was due to speak to Rudd last night and isn’t expected
to name any new faces when she announces her ministerial lineup,
meaning Mark Arbib and  Bill Shorten  are unlikely to be rewarded
for their role in the decision to strip Rudd of the prime
ministership, according to the newspaper.
