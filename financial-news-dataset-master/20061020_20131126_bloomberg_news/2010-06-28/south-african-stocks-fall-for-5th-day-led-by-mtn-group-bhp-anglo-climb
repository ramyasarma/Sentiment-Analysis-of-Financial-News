             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  fell for a fifth day, losing 23.96, or 0.1 percent,
to 27,234.11 at 12:48 p.m. in Johannesburg. The measure has
dropped 5.3 percent this quarter, heading for its first
quarterly drop since the first three months of 2009.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, rose for the first time in five days, climbing 1.42
rand, or 0.7 percent, to 214.92 rand.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL
SJ) increased 2.58 rand, or 0.9 percent, to 286.39 rand. Copper
rose in London for a third day before a U.S. report on personal
spending that may signal growth, boosting demand for industrial
metals.  
 MTN Group Ltd.  (MTN SJ), Africa’s largest mobile-phone
company, dropped 1.48 rand, or 1.4 percent, to 106.01 rand. A
close at this price would be the lowest since June 11. MTN says
it isn’t in talks with Loop Telecom of India, group spokeswoman
Nozipho January-Bardill said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 Business Standard reported the two companies were in
negotiations, with Loop seeking to sell as much as 45 percent.  
 Naspers Ltd.  (NPN SJ) climbed for the first time in three
days, gaining 3.19 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 265.19 rand. The
media group doesn’t expect recently announced regulatory changes
in China to have any impact on its investment in Tencent
Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest Internet company by market value,
Chief Executive Officer  Koos Bekker  said.
