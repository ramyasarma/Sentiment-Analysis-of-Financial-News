             Bread and cookie makers in India,
the second-biggest wheat producer, may almost double imports of
the grain from Australia and Ukraine as they look for cheaper
supplies from overseas.  
 Flour mills may import as much as 300,000 metric tons in
the year ending March 31, compared with 158,000 tons last year,
said M.K. Dattaraj, former president of the Roller Flour Millers
Federation of India. Premium quality Australian grain will make
up most of the purchase, he said.  
 India last week said it will sell 5 million tons of wheat
in the open market to cool prices, which have gained 10 percent
since the start of the financial year on April 1. Millers in the
country’s southern states, who rely on supplies from the growing
regions in the north, may not benefit from the sale.  
 “There’s a small window of opportunity for imports as the
wheat supplied by the government is more expensive than imported
wheat in southern India,”  Atul Chaturvedi , president at Adani
Enterprises Ltd., the nation’s largest non-state trader of farm
goods, said in a telephone interview from Ahmedabad.  
 Mills in the southern city of Bangalore pay about $318 a
ton for premium quality Australian wheat, compared with 14,200
rupees ($307) for common variety grain from the state-run Food
Corp. of India, Dattaraj said. Black Sea-origin wheat is cheaper
at about $245 to $250 at southern Indian ports, Chaturvedi said.  
 Increase Orders  
 Users may have contracted to buy 100,000 tons since April 1,
mostly for shipment in July and August, and may increase orders,
Dattaraj said.  
 “The bulk of the wheat needed by mills in South India is
yet to be contracted,” he said.  
 Wheat for September delivery lost as much as 1.1 percent to
$4.6575 a bushel in Chicago, and traded at $4.6825 at 11:48 a.m.
Mumbai time. July-delivery wheat fell as much as 1.4 percent to
1,224.80 rupees per 100 kilograms on the National Commodity &
Derivatives Exchange in Mumbai.  
 Indian mills require as much as 9 million tons until March
31, and the quantity to be sold by the government is not enough,
Veena Sharma, secretary at the Roller Flour Millers Federation
of India, said last week from New Delhi.  
 The marketing year for wheat in India runs from April to
March. State warehouses held 35.16 million tons of wheat and 25.3
million tons of rice on June 1, according to the food ministry.
