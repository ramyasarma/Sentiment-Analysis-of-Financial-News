             Oprah Winfrey  returned to the top
spot in Forbes magazine’s annual ranking of the most powerful
celebrities, as the talk-show host and television executive
brought in earnings of $315 million in the past year.  
 Winfrey, 56, who has led the list four times, climbed back
to No. 1 after being bumped to second last year by  Angelina Jolie , 35, who fell to 18th in the latest rankings, according to
New York-based  Forbes .  
 Tiger Woods  checked in at fifth, unchanged from the
previous year, with income of $105 million even while losing
endorsements after his marital infidelity scandal. The magazine
had estimated his income at $110 million for the 2009 edition.  
 The rankings are based on the magazine’s estimates of
income and clout. Jolie took last year’s honors with earnings of
$27 million because of “the release of several blockbuster
movies and an endless sea of media buzz,” Forbes said at the
time. Winfrey was the top earner in 2009 at $275 million.  
 Forbes said the total earnings of celebrities on the list
soared in the past year, increasing 15 percent to $4.7 billion
from $4.1 billion in the 2009 rankings.  
 Lady Gaga  is the list’s top-ranked newcomer, in fourth
place with income of $62 million. Also new to the list are
“Twilight” co-stars  Robert Pattinson  and  Kristen Stewart  at
50th and 66th, respectively, late-night host  Conan O’Brien  at
51, the Black Eyed Peas at 16,  Robert Downey Jr.  in 73rd place
and comedian and talk-show host Chelsea Handler at 98th.  
 Following is the top 10 of the magazine’s listing, called
“The Celebrity 100.”
