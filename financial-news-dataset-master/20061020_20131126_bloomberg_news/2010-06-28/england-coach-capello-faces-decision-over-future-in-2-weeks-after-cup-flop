             Fabio Capello  said he wants to stay
on as England soccer coach after yesterday’s World Cup loss to
Germany, and added that his future will be decided by the
Football Association over the next two weeks.  
 “I spoke this morning with (Club England Chairman) Sir
Dave Richards and he told me that he needs two weeks to decide.
I said I can be the manager of England next season, but they
have to decide.”  
 Capello was speaking at a televised news conference after
yesterday’s 4-1 loss to Germany at Bloemfontein in the World Cup
round of 16.
