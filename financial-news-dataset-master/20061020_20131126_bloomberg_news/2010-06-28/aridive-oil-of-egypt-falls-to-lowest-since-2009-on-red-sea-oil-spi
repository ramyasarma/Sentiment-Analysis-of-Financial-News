             Maridive & Oil  Services SAE, an
Egyptian marine and oil support services company, fell to its
lowest level in more than a year on investor concern an oil
spill off of the country’s Red Sea coast will hurt profits.  
 Maridive lost 4.4 percent to $3.26, the lowest close since
May 2009, valuing the company at $834.6 million. The stock has
declined 12 percent since the Oil Ministry announced June 20 the
spill off Sahl Hasheesh, a resort town on the Eastern coast.  
 Investors are under the impression “that the oil spill will
affect the company negatively,” said  Karim Osman , a Cairo-based
equity analyst at Prime Holding who has a “strong buy”
recommendation on the stock. “Maridive has the capability to
clean up such a spill so this should in fact have a positive
effect on the company.”  
 Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30 Index  fell for the fifth day,
dropping 0.6 percent to 6,256.48, the lowest close since June
10.
