             Richard Lambert  will step down as
director general of the Confederation of British Industry in
early 2011, the U.K.’s biggest business lobby said.  
 “Now is the right time in the political and economic cycle
for me to hand over to a new director general,” Lambert said in
the e-mailed statement today. “I have no definite plans at the
moment but will be looking for interesting things to do.”  
 Lambert, 65, sat on the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee between 2003 and 2006 and was editor of the Financial
Times newspaper for 10 years before that. He joined the business
lobby group in July 2006 for a five-year term.  
 U.K. executive recruitment company  Saxton Bampfylde  will
search for a replacement, the CBI said.
