             BP Plc will be allowed to continue
drilling for oil and gas in  Libya , Shokri Ghanem , the North
African country’s top oil official, said in a statement posted
on the website of Libya’s National Oil Corp.  
 The Gulf of Mexico oil spill will not “change our
confidence” in BP and shouldn’t stand in the way of scientific
progress such as deep-water drilling, Ghanem said.  
 BP said today the cost of battling the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill has reached $2.65 billion as work continues to drill two
relief wells to plug the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. The
London-based company in 2007 signed an agreement with the
investment arm of the Libyan government to explore for gas along
an offshore tract the size of Belgium.  
 “BP has huge capabilities, long-standing experience and
high-standard abilities that it could use to tackle the spill
and overcome the crisis,” said Ghanem, who is also the chairman
of National Oil Corp.  
 Libya, holder of Africa’s largest oil reserves and an OPEC
member, pumped 1.55 million barrels of oil a day in May,
according to output estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 International oil companies such as  Royal Dutch Shell Plc ,
Eni SpA and Repsol YPF SA produce and explore for oil and gas in
Libya. The country ships natural gas to Europe through a
pipeline to Italy and in liquid form to Spain.
