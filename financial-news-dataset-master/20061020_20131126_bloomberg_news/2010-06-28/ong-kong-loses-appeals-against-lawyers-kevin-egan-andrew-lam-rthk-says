             Hong Kong’s government lost its
appeal to reinstate a conviction against lawyer Kevin Egan for
perverting the course of justice, Radio Television Hong Kong
reported today, citing proceedings at the Court of Final Appeal.  
 The Court also quashed the convictions for the same offence
of another lawyer  Andrew Lam  and another defendant, RTHK said.
Egan was earlier charged with revealing the identity of a person
held in an Independent Commission Against Corruption witness
protection program, according to the report.  
 Lam had received a six-year prison sentence for his role in
an ICAC investigation of Semtech International Holdings by Hong
Kong’s, RTHK said.
