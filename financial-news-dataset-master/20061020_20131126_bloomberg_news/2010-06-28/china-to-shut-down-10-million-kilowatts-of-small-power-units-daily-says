             China will shut down small thermal
power units totaling 10 million kilowatts in capacity this year,
said  Nanfang Daily , citing unnamed officials at the National
Energy Administration.  
 The closure is part of a government plan to improve fuel
efficiency, according to the report. China has closed small
thermal power units with a combined capacity of 64.17 million
kilowatts since 2006, it said, without saying whether the plants
were fired by coal or oil.  
 The world’s second-biggest fuel user cut its energy use per
unit of gross domestic product by 14.38 percent between 2006 and
2009, and plans to reduce consumption by 20 percent in the five
years to 2010.
