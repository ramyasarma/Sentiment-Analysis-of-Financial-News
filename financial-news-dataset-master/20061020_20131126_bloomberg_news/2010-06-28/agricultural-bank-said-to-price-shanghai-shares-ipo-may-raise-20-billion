             Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  set
a price range for the Shanghai part of its initial public
offering that will allow it to raise as much as $20.1 billion,
according to a company statement.  
 The Beijing-based bank may offer 22.2 billion shares in
Shanghai at 2.52 yuan to 2.68 yuan apiece, it said today in a
 statement  to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Agricultural Bank last
week priced shares in the Hong Kong part of its IPO at HK$2.88
to HK$3.48 each.  
 Agricultural Bank may still surpass  Industrial & Commercial
Bank of China Ltd .’s 2006 IPO as the world’s largest if it
exercises an option to expand the sale to $23.1 billion. China’s
largest bank by customers is going public after the  Shanghai
Composite Index  slumped 22 percent this year and Fitch Ratings
warned that 2009’s  record loans  may saddle lenders with bad
debt.  
 “This could be a booster for banking shares and the broad
market,” said  Leo Gao , who helps oversee about $600 million at
APS Asset Management Ltd. in Shanghai. “You’d rather price the
shares low to give it room for a rally on the debut than have it
fallen from grace.”  
 Shares of ICBC , the world’s largest bank, have slumped 22
percent this year in Shanghai trading, while its closest rival,
China Construction Bank Corp., has dropped 20 percent.  
 Defying Global Drop  
 Still, Chinese IPOs have defied the drop in the global
market this year, where more than 30 companies have postponed or
withdrawn first-time sales since the start of May, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of companies that went public
in Shanghai and Shenzhen gained an average 29 percent in their
first month of trading through June 1, Bloomberg data shows.  
 Agricultural Bank board secretary  Li Zhenjiang  wasn’t
immediately available to comment. The Shanghai pricing needs
approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission.  
 Agricultural Bank has an option to increase the IPO by 15
percent to meet excess demand, boosting the shares it sells in
Hong Kong to 29.22 billion and in Shanghai to 25.57 billion.
Beijing-based ICBC raised $21.9 billion in October 2006 in the
world’s largest IPO.  
 Agricultural Bank set aside $5.45 billion of the Hong Kong
part of the IPO for corporate investors, according to a June 25
filing. Qatar Investment Authority agreed to invest $2.8 billion
and Kuwait Investment Authority said it would buy $800 million.  
 Cornerstone Investors  
 Corporate, or cornerstone, investors are guaranteed shares
in IPOs in exchange for a pledge to hold the stock for a period.  
 The high end of the price for Agricultural Bank’s A shares
is at 10.27 times estimated 2010 earnings, the statement said.  
 The high end is also about 1.6 times the company’s 2010
book value, said  Li Qing , a Shanghai-based analyst at Everbright
Pramerica Fund Management Co. That compares with  1.83 times  for
ICBC and 1.81 times for Construction Bank in Shanghai trading.  
 Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s third-largest by assets as
of March 31 and Agricultural Bank’s closest rival in
profitability, trades at 1.53 times estimated book value.  
 Chinese banks’ surge in loan growth since late 2008 has
raised their exposure to credit risk and future asset quality
deterioration is “a near certainty,” Fitch Ratings said last
week. Banks’ financial positions are “more strained than it
appears,” according to Fitch.  
 Agricultural Bank, with 320 million customers and 23,624
outlets in China at the end of last year, advanced about 1
trillion yuan of new loans last year, more than the gross
domestic economy of New Zealand. Its non-performing loan ratio
stood at 2.91 percent as of Dec. 31.  
 Capital Adequacy  
 The lender had a capital adequacy ratio of 10.07 percent at
the end of 2009, the lowest among China’s largest state-
controlled banks. It targets a minimum ratio of 11.5 percent
from 2010 through 2012.  
 CICC, Citic Securities Co., China Galaxy Securities Co. and
Guotai Junan Securities Co. are managing Agricultural Bank’s
yuan-denominated A-share offering.  
 China International Capital Corp., Deutsche Bank AG,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Macquarie Group
Ltd. and  Morgan Stanley  were hired to arrange the Hong Kong
portion of the IPO, along with its own investment unit.
