             There are “plenty of other
avenues” for liquidity on offer from the European Central Bank
after the 440 billion euro ($544 billion) 12-month emergency
tender expires this week, said ING Groep NV.  
 Much of the money will be rolled over into other
instruments, including the six-month, three-month and one-month
tenders offered by the ECB, Padhraic Garvey, head of developed-
markets debt strategy at ING in Amsterdam, wrote in a research
report today. There is also cheaper liquidity available from the
wholesale market for the most-trusted banks, he said.  
 “Bottom line, there may be liquidity coming out of 
the market, but it will be purely voluntary,” he said.
