             Nigeria  will begin a program to
reintegrate former militants in the oil-rich Niger River delta
region back into society, the  Punch  reported, citing Timi
Alaibe, the presidential adviser on the region.  
 More than 20,000 former rebels will be involved in the
project, which will provide counseling and career-guidance, the
Lagos-based newspaper said.  
 The former militants, who were fighting for a greater share
of Nigeria’s oil wealth, agreed to disarm under an accord with
the federal government in September.
