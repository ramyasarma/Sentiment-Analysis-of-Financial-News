             BP Plc may complete within two and a
half weeks the first of two relief wells aimed at ending the
Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the London-based Times reported.  
 The relief well is within 200 horizontal feet of the
ruptured one and is being guided toward it by means of
electromagnetic and sonar ranging devices, the newspaper said.  
 U.S. Energy Secretary  Steven Chu  is likely to travel to
BP’s command center in Houston, Texas, to monitor the
operation, which involves piercing the damaged well and pumping
in mud and cement to seal it, the Times said.
