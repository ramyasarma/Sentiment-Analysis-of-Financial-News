             Treasuries rallied, pushing the
yield on the 10-year note to the lowest level since April 2009,
on concern the economic recovery will remain slow.  
 U.S. debt gained as a report indicated inflation was
contained last month and economists said the nonfarm payrolls
report later this week will show employers eliminated 115,000
jobs in June. Group of 20 leaders said over the weekend that
advanced economies plan to cut their deficits in half by 2013,
allowing them to curb record bond sales.  
 “Economic growth for the balance of 2010 is going to be
disappointing to a lot of people,” said  Gary Pollack , who helps
oversee $12 billion as head of fixed-income trading in New York
at Deutsche Bank AG’s private wealth management unit. “At the
same time, inflation is benign. With the Fed on hold, maybe 3
percent on 10-year notes is not a bad trade for the next couple
of months.”  
 The  yield  on the 10-year note decreased nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.02 percent at 4 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. It was the lowest level since
April 29, 2009. The 3.5 percent security maturing in May 2020
gained 3/4, or $7.50 per $1,000 face amount, to 104 1/32.  
 Treasuries are the world’s third-best-performing government
debt securities this quarter, having returned 4.05 percent,
trailing 5.10 percent for Denmark and 4.32 percent for Britain,
according to Bloomberg data.  
 Two-Year Note  
 The two-year  note  yield fell three basis points to 0.63
percent after earlier dropping to 0.62 percent, the lowest level
since Nov. 27. The yield is approaching the record low of 0.6044
percent set Dec. 17, 2008, after the Federal Reserve cut its
 target  for overnight lending to a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  
 The yield on the 10-year note will climb to 3.78 percent by
year-end, according to the median estimate of 64 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The yield on the 2-year note should
increase to 1.32 percent, according to the median estimate in a
separate Bloomberg survey.  
 The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year notes over
2-year securities, charted on the yield curve, fell today to
2.40 percentage points, the narrowest since May 26, when it
touched 2.37 percentage points.  
 The yield curve plots the rates of bonds at different
maturities, with a flatter curve reflecting increased demand for
longer maturities from investors expecting lower economic growth
and slower inflation.  
 ‘Bull Flattener’  
 “The curve has gotten a bull flattener,” said  Andy Richman , who oversees $10 billion as a strategist in Palm Beach,
Florida, for SunTrust Banks Inc.’s private wealth management
division. “The economic numbers are looking and coming in
weaker than expected.”  
 Treasuries also rose as U.S. buyers sought longer-term
securities to increase the duration of their portfolios to match
their benchmarks at the end of the second quarter.  
 U.S. government debt extension increased by 0.06 years for
July 1, compared with 0.09 years for June 1, according to
Barclays Plc, one of 18 primary dealers that trade directly with
the Fed. Duration measures how sensitive a bond’s price is to
changes in yield.  
 Longer-term government debt was supported as a government
report showed muted inflation.  
 The inflation gauge tied to spending patterns increased 1.9
percent from May 2009 after a 2 percent gain in the 12 months
through April, the Commerce Department reported.  
 ‘Room to Play’  
 “There was nothing in the data to disturb the trend of
lower yields,” said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at
FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. “The move toward that view
has more room to play.”  
 The Fed said on June 23 at the conclusion of its two-day
meeting that the recovery pace is “likely to be moderate for a
time” and reiterated its commitment to an “extended period”
of low borrowing costs.  
 A lower-than-expected 431,000 new jobs for the U.S. in May
included a 411,000 jump in government hiring of temporary
workers for the 2010 census, the Labor Department reported on
June 4. The payrolls report for this month is due on July 2.  
 President  Barack Obama  said the goal set by the G-20
nations of cutting deficits reflects U.S. targets and takes into
account the fiscal and economic needs of each country. The White
House projects the U.S. shortfall will be a record of almost
$1.6 trillion this year. U.S. marketable debt has climbed to an
unprecedented $7.96 trillion.  
 Global bond returns may have nowhere to go but down after
the best first half since 2005.  
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note has returned 7.85
percent this year, including reinvested interest, leading global
government bonds to a gain of 3.36 percent, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. That’s the best start since the
firm’s broadest sovereign debt index rose 3.77 percent in the
first half of 2005.
