             A Togolese opposition party plans to
appeal a court’s decision to dissolve it, its leader said.  
 The Court of Justice in the capital, Lome, on June 25
dissolved L’Organisation pour Batir dans L’Unite un Togo
Solidaire, known as Obuts, following a request by two of its
founders, who contested how the party is managed.  
 “I will lodge an appeal because this decision is illegal
and unfair,” Obuts leader Agbeyome Kodjo said by telephone
yesterday. “If at the end of the appeal procedure, the Court of
Justice of Lome doesn’t take the right and favorable decision, I
will lodge another appeal to the court of the Economic Community
of West African States.”  
 Kodjo was a presidential candidate in the March 4 election
won by Faure Gnassingbe, whose victory has been rejected by the
country’s main opposition. Gnassingbe, whose family has ruled
the West African nation since 1967, won elections with 60.88
percent of the vote, the Constitutional Court ruled on March 18.  
 The main opposition Union of Forces for Change party
rejected the results after claiming there were irregularities in
the vote. The party’s candidate, Jean-Pierre Fabre, garnered
33.9 percent of the ballots cast.  
 Togolese authorities plan to “kill Obuts” because it also
rejected Gnassingbe’s election victory, Kodjo said.
