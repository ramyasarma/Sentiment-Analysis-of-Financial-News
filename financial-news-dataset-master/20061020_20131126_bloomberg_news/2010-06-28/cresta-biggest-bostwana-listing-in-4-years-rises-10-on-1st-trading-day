             Cresta Marakanelo Ltd. , a Botswanan
hotel operator whose listing is the biggest on the country’s
 stock exchange  in four years, closed 6.9 percent higher on its
first day of trading.  
 The shares gained 10 thebe to trade at 1.55 pula at the
close of trading in the capital, Gaborone, data obtained from
the exchange’s website show. The stock was sold at 1.45 pula in
the initial public offering.  
 “Cresta’s share offer was the biggest we have registered
in four years,” bourse Chief Executive Officer Hiran Mendis
told reporters today. “Many companies do not usually trade on
the first day of listing,” he said.  
 Cresta’s is the second new listing on the southern African
nation’s bourse this year after  Wilderness Holdings Ltd. , a
safari-camps operator, whose shares began trading on April 8.
The Botswana Development Corp., the government investment
company that owns part of Cresta, sold 94 percent of the 40.7
million shares it had put up for sale in the hotel operator’s
initial public offering, raising 55.5 million pula ($8 million).  
 Through the offering, Botswana Development Corp. hoped to
reduce its 60 percent stake in Cresta to 26 percent.  
 Following the sale,  TA Holdings Ltd. , a Harare, Zimbabwe-
based investment company, holds 40 percent of Cresta. The
Botswana Development Corp. has 27.35 percent, while individual
investors have 20.65 percent. Institutional investors have 10
percent and an employee share trust holds the remaining 2
percent, according to a statement from the exchange.  
 The 20-member  Botswana Domestic Companies Index  has
declined 1.9 percent this quarter, paring its gain this year to
1.4 percent.
