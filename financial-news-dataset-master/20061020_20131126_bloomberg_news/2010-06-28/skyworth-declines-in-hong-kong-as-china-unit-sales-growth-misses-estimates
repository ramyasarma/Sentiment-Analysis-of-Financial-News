             Skyworth Digital Holdings Ltd. , a
Chinese television maker, dropped to its lowest in a month in
Hong Kong trading as sales growth at its China unit missed
expectations.  
 The stock declined 6.6 percent to HK$5.70 at the 12:30 p.m.
trading break in Hong Kong, the lowest since May 27.  
 Revenue at the China unit grew 1 percent in May from the
same period a year earlier, the statement said, without
providing a number. China’s government has been offering
subsidies on selected appliances as it aims to increase domestic
demand in order to lessen the economy’s reliance on exports.  
 “The sales figures are smaller than expected,” said
 Castor Pang , Cinda International Holdings Ltd.’s research
director in Hong Kong. “China’s subsidies on TV purchases did
not help it much.”  
 Skyworth reported that sales volume of all types of
televisions at its mainland China unit fell 11 percent in May
from a year earlier, the company said in a statement to the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange. Sales of flat panel TVs grew 7 percent in
China during the same period, the company said.  
 Pang said analysts had been hoping for TV sales growth of
about 20 percent.
