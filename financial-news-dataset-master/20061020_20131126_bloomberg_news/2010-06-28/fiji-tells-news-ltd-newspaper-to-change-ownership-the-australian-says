             Fiji’s military-led government has 
told News Ltd.’s Fiji Times newspaper that it must change its 
ownership structure so that 90 percent of its investors are 
citizens of the country or face closure, the Australian 
newspaper reported.  
 The government is also establishing a tribunal to monitor 
the media’s compliance and keep material that is against the 
“national interest or public order” from being disseminated, 
the Australian said, citing Fiji Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed 
Khaiyum.
