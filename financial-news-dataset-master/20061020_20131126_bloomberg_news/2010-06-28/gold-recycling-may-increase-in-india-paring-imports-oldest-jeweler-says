             Consumers in India, the world’s
biggest gold user, may increase recycling of jewelry should
bullion prices continue to rise, paring imports of the metal,
according to  Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri Pvt.   
 “If prices go up further then we might see a steep rise in
recycling,”  Shrikant Zaveri , chairman of the nation’s oldest-
gold jewelry retailer, said in an interview in Mumbai. “Imports
of gold will definitely have an impact.”  
 Gold, which reached a record $1,265.30 an ounce on June 21,
is set for a 10th straight annual increase as investors seek to
protect their wealth on concern currencies will depreciate. The
price may climb to an all-time high and trade in a range of
$1,400 to $1,500, Zaveri said, without providing a time frame.  
 “We have seen a little shift in the buying pattern toward
coins and bullion,” he said. “If there is a sharp rise, that
might probably continue.”  
 India’s gold imports slumped to between 16 to 17 metric
tons in May, from 34 tons in April, Citigroup Inc. economists
 Rohini Malkani  and  Anushka Shah  said in a report June 21. Higher
prices have started to hurt jewelry consumption, they said.  
 Futures in New York have advanced 15 percent this year and
reached a record $1,266.50 on June 21.  
 Plans by the 145-year-old jeweler to sell shares in an
initial public offering have been delayed, Zaveri said. The sale
should happen by the end of this year, he said. Zaveri said Oct.
30 the share sale would be concluded by the second-quarter.  
 “The world market scenario wasn’t right so we took a
decision to delay,” he said. “We are on our way to the IPO.”  
 Gold on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd., the
world’s second-biggest bourse for bullion, has risen 29 percent
in the past year and reached a record 19,198 rupees per 10 grams
on June 8. Futures added 0.1 percent to 18,814 rupees on June 26.
