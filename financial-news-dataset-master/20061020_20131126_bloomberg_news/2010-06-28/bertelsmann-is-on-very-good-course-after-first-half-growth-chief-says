             Bertelsmann AG , Europe’s largest
media company, remains on a “very good course,” Chief
Executive Officer  Hartmut Ostrowski  said.  
 “I’m very optimistic about the current development, and
not just for Bertelsmann,” Ostrowski said, according to the
prepared text of a speech that he gave at a media forum in
Cologne today. “We as an industry should finally stop doubting
ourselves.”  
 After a “record” first  quarter , “also after six months
we are on a very good course,” the CEO said.  
 The owner of broadcaster RTL Group and Stern magazine had
first-quarter  net income  of 15 million euros ($18.5 million)
after a net loss of 94 million euros a year, earlier helped by
cost cuts and higher advertising sales. The Guetersloh, Germany-
based company’s revenue rose 2.7 percent to 3.6 billion euros.  
 Even though a partial recovery has taken place, the media
industry needs to come to grips with the new “market reality”
and get used to a permanently lower cost base, Ostrowski said.  
 In May, closely held Bertelsmann, which  competes  with
 Vivendi SA  and  Time Warner Inc. , predicted “stable”
performance for revenue and operating earnings before interest
and taxes this year, and “significantly higher” profit than last
year.
