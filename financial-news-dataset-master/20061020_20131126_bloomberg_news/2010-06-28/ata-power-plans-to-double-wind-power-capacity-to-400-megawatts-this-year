             Tata Power Ltd. , India’s largest
non-state generator, plans to double its wind power capacity to
400 megawatts this year, the company said today.  
 The Mumbai-based utility plans to add 88 megawatts of
capacity using turbines from Germany’s  Kenersys Europe GmbH  and
will shortly place an order for a separate 150-megawatt project
to be set up in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu states, it said in an
e-mailed statement. One megawatt is enough to power about 800
U.S. homes.  
 Tata Power generates about 20 percent of its total 3,000
megawatts of capacity from clean sources, such as wind and
hydropower, and plans to expand that share to 25 percent in four
years, Managing Director  Prasad Menon  said in the statement.  
 “We want to ensure that at least 8,000 megawatts to 10,000
megawatts of our generation will be from low carbon, or zero
emission technologies like hydro, solar, wind or from hot
gases,”  Banmali Agrawala , executive director of strategy and
business development, said in the statement.
