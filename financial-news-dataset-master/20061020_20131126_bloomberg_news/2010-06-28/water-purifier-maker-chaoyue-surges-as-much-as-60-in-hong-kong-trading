             Chaoyue Group Ltd. , an unprofitable
Hong Kong-listed maker of water purifiers and dispensers, surged
37 percent on the city’s stock exchange, the stock’s biggest
increase in 21 months.  
 Chaoyue  gained 19 Hong Kong cents to close at 71 Hong Kong
cents, the most since Sept. 19, 2008, on trading  volume  that was
30 times the average over the past year. Today’s gain trimmed
Chaoyue’s  decline  this year to 20 percent, compared with a 5.2
percent drop in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  
 The company, which last year acquired platinum and gold
mining businesses, said it wasn’t aware of any reasons for the
 share-price increase . “There are no negotiations or agreements
relating to intended acquisitions or realizations which are
discloseable” under the rules of the city’s stock exchange,
Chaoyue said in a statement today.  
 The maker of drinking-water machines said April 30 that it
expected to report “a very significant loss” for its fiscal
year, which ended in March. Chaoyue reported a  loss  of
HK$3.7 billion ($475 million) in the six months ended September.  
 Chaoyue also makes water and air purifiers for food-
processing, car factories and hospitals. The company
discontinued its garment business in August last year.
