             India’s rupee appreciated against
the dollar for a second day after overseas investors increased
holdings of the nation’s shares to a record.  
 The currency touched its strongest level in a week after
Securities and Exchange Board of India data showed foreign
 investment  in stocks rose $6.6 billion this year to an all-time
high of $79.4 billion on June 24. The Bombay Stock Exchange’s
 Sensitive Index , or Sensex, has gained 4.9 percent this month
after the government said June 11 that  factory output  grew 17.6
percent in April, near the most in at least 16 years.  
 “The important thing for the rupee is how the Sensex
fares,” said  Philip Wee , a Singapore-based senior currency
economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. “The rupee is a capital-
flow story due to its twin deficits. The fiscal deficit is doing
well as the economy is doing well. But the problem is that stock
flows are needed for the current account.”  
 The rupee strengthened 0.2 percent to 46.21 per dollar as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose as high as 46.055 earlier, the strongest
level since June 22. The currency may advance to 45.80 by Sept.
30 and 45.60 by Dec. 31, Wee said.  
 Offshore forwards indicated the Indian currency will trade
at 46.69 to the dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 46.90 at the end of last week. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  
 India’s economy expanded  8.6 percent  last quarter from a
year earlier, the second-fastest pace among major economies, the
government reported on May 31. The South Asian nation’s current
account  shortfall  was $12.03 billion in the three months ended
Dec. 31, the most in five quarters, according to the latest
central bank data.
