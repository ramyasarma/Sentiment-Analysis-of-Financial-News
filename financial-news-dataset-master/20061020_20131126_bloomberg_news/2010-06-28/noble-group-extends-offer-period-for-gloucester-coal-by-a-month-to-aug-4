             Gloucester Coal Ltd.  has received an
extension of the offer period for its parent  Noble Group Ltd. ’s
A$1 billion ($875 million) takeover bid.  
 Noble has extended the time allowed for the Australian
commodities supplier to decide on the bid by a month to Aug. 4,
the company said in a statement today.  
 Hong Kong-based Noble made the offer through its subsidiary
Osendo Pty. on June 1.  
 Directors at Sydney-based Gloucester recommended on June 21
that shareholders accept the bid, which will pay the Australian
coal producer A$12.60 a share for the 12 percent of the company
Noble doesn’t already own. The price is a 16-cent premium to
Gloucester’s closing  price  on June 18.  
 An independent report prepared by Deloitte Corporate
Finance Pty found the fair market value of Gloucester shares to
be A$11.10 to A$12, Gloucester said on June 21.  
 Noble ended talks to sell some of its Australian coal
assets to rival Macarthur Coal Ltd. on May 13.
