             NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX Group
Inc. canceled trades that briefly sent shares of  Boeing Co. , the
aircraft maker that’s one of thirty Dow Jones Industrial Average
stocks, down 44 percent this morning.  
 The errant orders sent Chicago-based  Boeing  down to $38.77
at 7:14 a.m. New York time today from $68.77 at the end of last
week, with 800 shares changing hands on NYSE Arca and 200 on
Nasdaq. They fetched $68.50 in the next trade, at 8:06 a.m., and
were at $67.30 as of 4 p.m.  
 While U.S. stock exchanges have implemented curbs to help
prevent swings in the price of individual companies from causing
another crash like the May 6 rout, they only apply after 9:45
a.m. New York time. Companies such as Accenture Plc, which now
trades for $39.72, fell to 1 cent on May 6 as U.S. stocks lost
$862 billion in value in less than 20 minutes.  
 “The bigger issue is making sure investors feel the market
is safe for them to invest,” said  Brett Mock , chairman of the
Security Traders Association, a trade group based in Darien,
Connecticut. “Obviously they need to make sure there’s uniform
standards across the markets.”  
 The Securities and Exchange Commission is testing a program
through December that pauses trading for 5 minutes in Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index companies, including Boeing, when their stock
rises or falls 10 percent or more in less than 5 minutes after
9:45 a.m. New York time. Building on the circuit-breaker test,
U.S. exchanges offered rules this month to standardize the
process for canceling clearly erroneous stock trades.  
 Nasdaq, NYSE Euronext  
 Boeing spokesman  Charles Bickers  confirmed that the trades
were canceled and said he had no other information at the time.
Nasdaq OMX spokesman  Robert Madden  didn’t immediately respond to
phone calls or e-mails requesting comment.  
 “We’ve been discussing the subject of circuit breakers
with the SEC, and those discussions are ongoing,” NYSE Euronext
spokesman  Ray Pellecchia  said in an interview. “The clearly
erroneous rules have been revised, so that’s the next thing the
SEC is considering.”  
 Three equity orders that pushed  Washington Post Co.  shares
up 99 percent in less than one second on June 16 showed why the
SEC began the program this month to halt stocks during times of
volatility.  Trades  totaling 766 shares at $919.18 or $929.18
crossed on NYSE Euronext’s NYSE Arca platform at 3:07:30 p.m. in
New York that day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The stock
changed hands for $462.84 prior to the jump. The orders were
later canceled.  
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged almost 1,000
points on May 6. A May 18 report from the SEC and Commodity
Futures Trading Commission gave six potential causes of the
crash, including trading curbs that applied only at the New York
Stock Exchange. Halts “will help reduce the likelihood of this
type of unusual trading activity from recurring,” SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said on June 2.
