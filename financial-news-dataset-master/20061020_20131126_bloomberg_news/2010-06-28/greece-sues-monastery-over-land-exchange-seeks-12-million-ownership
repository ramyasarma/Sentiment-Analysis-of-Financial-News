             Greece sued an Orthodox Christian
monastery over a land deal, seeking ownership recognition and a
damages payment.  
 Greece’s State Legal Council filed its case against
Vatopedi monastery on June 25th asking that an Athens court
recognize the government as the owner of 180 stremmata (44.5
acres) in northern Greece that was part of a land exchange deal
in 2007, according to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-
based finance ministry today.  
 The government also asked for 10 million euros ($12.3
million) in moral harm payments, the statement said.  
 Two members of former Prime Minister  Kostas Karamanlis ’s
government resigned in the furor over the sale of state land to
the monastery, a transaction that cost Greek taxpayers 100
million euros, according to media reports.  
 Calls to the monastery outside of normal operating hours
weren’t answered. The  Vatopedi monastery , on the autonomous
monastic community of Mount Athos in northern Greece, is
administered by Patriarch Vartholomeos, the spiritual head of
the world’s estimated 250 million Orthodox Christians.
