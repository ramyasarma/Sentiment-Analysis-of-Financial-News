             Regal Petroleum Plc , a British
energy company focusing on natural-gas projects in Ukraine, fell
the most in more than four years after the nation ordered it to
suspend operations at its fields.  
 Regal fell 10.5 pence, or 29 percent, to 26 pence in
London. That’s the largest drop since Jan. 31, 2006.  
 The London-based company on May 21 received a letter from
Ukraine’s Minister of Environmental Protection, which identified
“certain matters” with the producer’s compliance with the
nation’s legislation and requested to suspend operations
“whilst such matters were rectified,” London-based Regal said
today in a statement.  
 “The company is in ongoing dialogue with” the government
to resolve the matters, “during which operations continue as
normal,” it said.  
 Regal has been working to boost production from its
Mekhediviska-Golotvshinska and Svyrydivske fields in  Ukraine 
after contracting two rigs from Italy’s Saipem SpA. The explorer
last year missed its output target of 3,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day because of technical and mechanical problems at
some new wells.
