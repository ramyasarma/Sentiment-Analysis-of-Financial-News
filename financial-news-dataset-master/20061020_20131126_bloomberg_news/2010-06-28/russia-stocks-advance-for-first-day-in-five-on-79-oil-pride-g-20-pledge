             Russian stocks and the ruble rose
the most in a week as crude oil traded above $78 a barrel and
leaders from the Group of 20 nations endorsed targets to cut
deficits, easing concern of defaults.  
 OAO Rosneft , the country’s biggest oil producer and  OAO
Sberbank , Russia’s largest lender, added as much as 3.5 percent.
The 30-stock Micex Index rose 1.7 percent to 1,369.75 at 3:28
p.m. in Moscow, heading for its first day of gains in a week.  
 Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, was at $78.25 a barrel,
1.2 percent higher than at the close of equities trading in
Moscow on June 25. Prices reached $79.38 a barrel earlier.
Investors’ appetite for riskier assets increased after pledges
from G-20 leaders over the weekend helped curb concern budget
shortfalls will pull the global economy back into recession.  
 “Oil at $79 a barrel is very good environment for
Russia,” Andrei Kuznetsov, a strategist at Troika Dialog, said
by phone today. “Demand for commodities is high.”  
 Russian stocks are down 5.6 percent from March 31, headed
for their first quarterly drop since the last three months of
2008 as speculation increased that European deficits will hobble
a global economic recovery.  
 Bonds Gain  
 The Russian currency strengthened 0.2 percent against the
greenback to 31.0345 in Moscow, its biggest gain since June 21.
The government’s benchmark sovereign dollar bonds due April 2020
climbed, with the yield falling 8 basis points to 5.41 percent.  
 Investors increased bets that the ruble will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
31.2150 per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of
31.2225 on June 25. The contracts are a guide to expectations of
currency movements as they allow foreign investors and companies
to fix the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The ruble slid 0.1 percent against the euro, weakening for
a fourth day, to 38.2985. Those movements left the ruble 0.1
percent stronger at 34.2979 against the central bank’s target
currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
