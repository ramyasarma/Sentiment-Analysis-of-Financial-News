             Premier Oil Plc , a U.K. explorer
operating in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, said its latest
oil discovery in the North Sea may boost the company’s reserves
by about 20 percent.  
 EnCore Oil Plc, the project operator, today estimated the
four Catcher structures may hold as much as 300 million barrels
of oil. The partners, including Wintershall AG, may pump the
first crude in 2013 or 2014, Premier Chief Financial Officer
 Tony Durrant  said. The partners will need to invest at least
$2.4 billion in capital and operating costs.  
 “That is very significant for Premier” as the project may
add about a fifth to the company’s 250 million barrels of oil
equivalent reserves, Durrant said today by phone. “It’s the
largest oil discovery for some time” off the U.K.  
 Catcher and Catcher East may hold 50 million to 80 million
barrels of oil reserves, up from a previous Premier estimate of
as little as 25 million barrels, Durrant said. The company and
its partners plan to explore Catcher South-West and Catcher
North to assess the further potential of the block, east of
Scotland.  
 Premier Oil  rose 84 pence, or 7.1 percent, to 1,266 pence
in London, the biggest trading gain since April 22, 2009. The
stock has advanced 15 percent this year.  
 EnCore advanced 47 percent to 52 pence. Nautical Petroleum
Plc, which also holds a stake in the project, gained 23 percent
to 170 pence in London.  
 In Asia, Premier is developing Vietnam’s Chim Sao and
Indonesia’s Gajah Baru projects and expects both to come on
stream next year, Durrant said.  
 The projects “are on schedule and on budget,” he said.
Gas demand in Singapore, which will take supplies from Gajah
Baru through a pipeline, “is amazing and they are taking every
molecule of gas we can produce,” he said  
 Premier plans to invest at least $550 million in projects
and in exploration this year, Durrant said.
