             The  Vatican  today admitted to
possible  “errors”  in the church’s handling of its real-estate
assets, responding for the first time to a corruption
investigation that has involved a top Roman Catholic cardinal.  
 Prosecutors are probing whether Cardinal  Crescenzio Sepe 
sold church property to former Infrastructure Minister  Pietro Lunardi  for a fraction of its market price in exchange for
subsidies, Italian newspapers including Corriere della Sera have
reported.  
 Between 2001 and 2006, Sepe led the  Congregation  for the
Evangelization of Peoples, the Vatican body that controls the
Church’s real-estate holdings worth $11 billion and funds
missionary work. Sepe, who now is archbishop of Naples, told
reporters on June 21 that he “always acted according to his
conscience and only in the best interests of the Church.” He
denies any wrongdoing.  
 “Managing such a fortune is naturally a very hard and
complex task, requiring one to defer to experts in the field,
and like in all financial operations one can be exposed to
errors in assessment and fluctuations in the international
market,” the Vatican said in a statement posted on its website.  
 The Vatican on June 21 added a link on its website that
outlined the procedures necessary for obtaining documents to the
congregation’s archive.
