             India’s government  bonds  gained on
speculation an increase in fuel prices last week will help Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh’s government trim the budget deficit
from a 16-year high.  
 Bonds also advanced after leaders from the Group of 20
nations agreed targets to improve fiscal discipline. Singh plans
to reduce the deficit to 5.5 percent of  gross domestic product 
in this fiscal year ending March from 6.9 percent last year,
reducing pressure on the market from bond sales.  
 “The fiscal position looks more convincing and that is
having a straight bearing on the sentiment,” said  Devendra Das ,
a fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai.
“The outlook is more optimistic for bonds than in the recent
past.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 fell six
basis points to 7.59 percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price rose
0.41, or 41 paise per 100-rupee face amount, to 101.41.  
 Last week, the government permitted state refiners to set
prices of gasoline higher by about 3.5 rupees (8 cents) a liter
and that of diesel by 2 rupees.  
 Bonds pared gains after  Reserve Bank of India  Deputy
Governor K.C. Chakrabarty said the central bank may raise
interest rates before its July 27 policy meeting to curb
inflation.  
 The South Asian nation’s  inflation  rate was 10.2 percent in
May, near the highest level in 17 months, government data show.
The central bank raised its  benchmark rate  by a quarter
percentage point each in March and April to 3.75 percent.  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
was little changed. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive
floating rates, was at 5.56 percent, compared with 5.57 percent
yesterday.
