             --  Gome Electrical Appliances
Holding Ltd. , China’s second-biggest electronics retailer by
market value, appointed Executive Vice President  Wang Jun Zhou  as president after  Chen Xiao  resigned from the post.  
 Chen will remain as chairman and executive director,
Gome said in a  statement  to Hong Kong’s stock exchange today.
Wang’s appointment is effective immediately.  
 This “is part of the company’s ongoing pursuit for the
best corporate governance practice,” the statement said.
“The board believes that the separation of the chairman and
president roles will further strengthen the management’s
effectiveness and efficiency.”  
 Wang, 48, will oversee Gome’s daily operations,
including business strategies and annual budgets, the
statement said. Wang, who has more than a decade’s experience
in sales and management in the electrical-appliance industry,
joined Gome in 2001 and has held various positions.  
 Gome fell 0.4 percent to HK$2.49 at 2:14 p.m. in Hong
Kong. The stock has fallen 11.7 percent this year, compared
with a 5.1 percent drop in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.
