             OAO Rostelecom , Russia’s dominant
long-distance operator, may save 30 billion rubles ($970
million) a year by merging with eight regional companies, while
failing to pass increased dividend payments on preferred stock.  
 The consolidation with the eight regional telephone
companies, which shareholders approved at a June 26 annual
meeting, will allow Rostelecom to cut capital expenditures,
eliminate spending on duplicate infrastructure and centralize
purchases, Chief Executive Officer  Anton Kolpakov  said.  
 The question of allocating 10 percent of profit for
dividends on preferred stock, regardless of the share of
preferred stock in the merged company’s total outstanding
equity, was postponed because less than a 75 percent quorum of
shareholders voted on the issue, Kolpakov said at the annual
meeting. He didn’t say when the issue would be voted on again.  
 Russia is seeking to remove direct competition among the
regional operators, while creating a large national telephone
operator. After the reorganization is completed in February
2011, the consolidated Rostelecom’s stock may be listed on
foreign exchanges, Kolpakov said.
