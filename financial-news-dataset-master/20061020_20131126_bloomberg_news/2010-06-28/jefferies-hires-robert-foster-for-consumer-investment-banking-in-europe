             Jefferies Group Inc. , the New York-
based securities firm that specializes in mid-size companies,
hired  Robert Foster  as head of consumer investment-banking for
Europe.  
 Foster, 36, will be based in London, Jefferies said today
in a statement. He started June 14 and reports to  David Weaver ,
president of Jefferies International, and  Jim Walsh , global head
of consumer investment-banking, spokesman Josh Passman said in
an e-mail.  
 Foster previously served as head of retail investment-
banking in Europe at Morgan Stanley for nine years, according to
the statement. Before Morgan Stanley, Foster was with UBS AG’s
mergers and acquisitions group in London and New York.  
 Jefferies reported $256 million in  investment-banking 
revenue last week, a record for the firm and more than double
the $120.8 million from a year earlier. The company has
increased its  headcount  by more than 25 percent since 2008, to
2,821 from 2,241, taking advantage of the collapse of larger
investment banks.  
 The consumer investment-banking team has book-run or
advised on 14 transactions worth $2.5 billion for clients this
year, Jefferies said in today’s statement.  
 Financial firms are adding jobs for the first time in two
years, with 6,800 industry positions added in New York from the
end of February through May, the largest three-month increase
since 2008, according to the  New York State Department of Labor .
