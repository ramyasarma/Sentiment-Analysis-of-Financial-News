             Brazilian central bank President
 Henrique Meirelles  said there’s a risk of a so-called double-dip
recession in Europe, Valor Economico reported.  
 The results of stress tests conducted by European central
banks may improve market confidence next month, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper said, citing Meirelles. While Brazilian policy
makers aren’t working on the assumption of another recession in
Europe, there are “uncertainties,” Valor said.  
 Brazilian economic growth is being sustained by “strong”
domestic demand, which may help avoid contagion if the European
crisis worsens, Meirelles said, according to Valor. He made the
comments on June 26 after a meeting at the Bank for
International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, Valor said.
