             BP Plc  was sued by members of its
employee savings plan over losses tied to the company’s plunging
stock price amid the oil leak disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 BP has lost more than half of its  market value  since the
April 20 explosion that caused the largest oil spill in U.S.
history. The fire and blast aboard the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that was working on a well for London-based BP
killed 11 members of its crew.  
 The lawsuit, for which the workers are seeking class-
action, or group, status was filed yesterday in federal court in
Chicago.  
 “Defendants knew or should have known that investment in
BP Plc equity was -- and continues to be -- an imprudent
investment of the ESP’s assets due to serious mismanagement and
improper business practices that resulted in catastrophic
incidents of international significance, including, among
others, the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico,” the plaintiffs
claimed.  
 Full-time, part-time, occasional and temporary employees
are eligible to invest in the  employee savings plan , or ESP,
according to the lawsuit. Regulatory filings show that the plan
held $2.45 billion worth of BP American depositary shares, or
29 percent its $8.27 billion of assets, at the end of 2009,
according to the complaint.  
 The lawsuit also names State Street Corp., trustee of the
plan, as a defendant.  
 Jon Pack, a BP spokesman, declined to comment.  Arlene Roberts , a State Street spokeswoman, didn’t immediately reply to
a message seeking comment.  
 Safety History  
 BP should have known that investing in the company’s stock
was an “imprudent investment” because the company has a
history of safety problems, including the 2005 explosion at a
refinery in Texas City, plaintiffs said in the lawsuit.  
 The defendants breached their fiduciary duties because they
didn’t sell the BP stock, hire an independent adviser to review
the plan or stop investing in BP stock, according to the
lawsuit.  
 Attorneys in the lawsuit representing the plaintiffs
include  W. Mark Lanier  and those at the firm Milberg LLP.  
 London-based BP said yesterday that the cost of battling
the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has reached $2.65 billion.  
 The case is Moule v. BP Corp. North America, 10-cv-03990,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).
