             Brazil’s real fluctuated between
gains and losses as forecasts of increased gross domestic
product in 2010 offset a rally in U.S. Treasuries.  
 The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.7838 per dollar at 10:03
a.m. New York time, from 1.7802 on June 25.  
 A June 25 central bank survey of about 100 economists
showed forecasts for 2010 GDP rose to 7.13 percent, up from 7.06
percent a week earlier. U.S. debt gained on concern the economic
recovery will remain slow.  
 “The action is centered in the Treasury market,” said
 Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin America fixed-income research at
IDEAglobal in New York. “The yield is down on the 10-year U.S.
Treasury note, and that’s symptomatic of less risk-on attitude.
This lessened risk-on attitude in Treasuries also can be seen in
a slightly firmer dollar, and that’s overflowing into a softer
real.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January was unchanged at 11.31 percent.
