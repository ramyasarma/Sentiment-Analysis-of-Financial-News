             The Central Bank of Nigeria cleared
the executive directors of banks it fired last year after
mounting debts threatened the industry, Vanguard reported today,
citing a letter by the regulator to the affected individuals.  
 The clearance makes the former directors eligible to work
again, according to the Lagos-based newspaper. They may be
called for further questioning should investigations show they
broke any laws. The central bank asked security agencies to
return their seized travel documents and other property,
Vanguard reported.  
 The directors were dismissed following the central bank’s
620 billion-naira ($4.1 billion) bailout of 10 lenders last
year.
