             Niger’s main bank labor union has
called for a two-day nationwide strike from today to seek a
change in the way salaries are decided, according to a statement
from Issoufou Saidou, the union’s Secretary-general.  
 The strike comes after the union failed to reach a deal
with the Association of Niger Banks, he said.
