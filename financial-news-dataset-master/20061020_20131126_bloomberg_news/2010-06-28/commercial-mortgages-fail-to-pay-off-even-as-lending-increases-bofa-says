             More than half of commercial
mortgages bundled and sold as bonds have been unable to pay off
maturing debt this year even as the availability of financing
increases, according to Bank of America Corp.  
 Between 50 percent and 60 percent of loans on skyscrapers,
hotels, shopping malls and apartment complexes failed to
refinance within a few months of their maturity date this year,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said in a report. That
compares with 15 percent to 20 percent in 2008, according to the
analysts led by  Roger Lehman  in New York. About $11 billion in
loans, or one-third of the 2010 total, had hit their expected
maturity dates through late May.  
 The amount of capital available to commercial property
owners has improved dramatically over the past year, though it
still falls short, according to the report. “The level of
financing is not where it was, or even where it needs to be for
a full commercial real estate market recovery,” the analysts
said.  
 If borrowers cannot refinance or pay off their loans, they
either default or persuade lenders to extend their maturities.  
 The biggest factor in whether a loan is able to pay off
when it comes due is which year it was taken out, as loans
written prior to the boom are more conservative. About 64
percent of loans originated in 2004 paid off, compared with 33
percent of those originated in 2005, the analysts said.  
 Interest-Only Loans  
 Some of the poorest-performing loans are those that delay
principal payments through part of the term, the report said.
Just 31 percent of so-called period interest-only loans paid off
at maturity, compared with 38 percent of loans that amortized
from the start, and 39 percent of loans that made no principal
payments until maturity, according to the report.  
 The period interest-only loans are “less well
underwritten, with higher leverage,” the analysts said. “The
very short amortization period does little to reduce that
leverage.”  
 A large number of loans with five-year terms taken out as
property values soared and underwriting standards plummeted will
come due during the next two years. More than $60 billion of the
debt matures in 2011 and $80 billion in 2012, according to Bank
of America.  
 Top-rated debt sold in 2007 yields 2.2 percentage points
more relative to benchmark rates than similar bonds sold in
2005, reflecting the view that loans taken out as sales of
commercial-mortgage-backed securities peaked are riskier,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG data.  
 Bond Issuance  
 A record $251.1 billion of bonds tied to commercial
mortgages were sold in 2007 after $223.3 billion in 2006,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of the debt
halted in 2008 as the credit crisis sapped demand, choking off
funds to borrowers. Even with government aid, only $3.04 billion
of the debt was issued last year. About $1.67 billion has been
issued in 2010.  
 Banks have been slow to write new loans to package for sale
as many borrowers struggle to pay off their existing mortgages
with property prices down 41 percent from the October 2007
highs, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  
 Late payments on commercial real estate loans packaged into
securities are at a record 7.5 percent, according to Moody’s,
and may reach 11 percent by yearend.
