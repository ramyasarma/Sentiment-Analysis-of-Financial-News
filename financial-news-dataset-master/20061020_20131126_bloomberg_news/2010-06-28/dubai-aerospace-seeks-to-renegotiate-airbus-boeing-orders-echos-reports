             Dubai Aerospace Enterprise is
seeking to renegotiate plane orders with Airbus SAS and Boeing
Co. as it attempts to reduce its debt levels, French daily Les
Echos reported, citing unidentified people.  
 DAE has ordered around 220 planes from the two companies
and for several weeks has stopped taking plane deliveries and
making payments, according to the newspaper. DAE has so far
taken only four of the 118 planes which it ordered from Boeing
in 2007, and none of the 100 Airbus planes, Les Echos said.  
 DAE declined to comment, while an unidentified person at
Airbus said only that the orders were still in the order book,
Les Echos said.
