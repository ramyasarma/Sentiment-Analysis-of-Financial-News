             Unidentified gunmen blew up a
natural-gas pipeline in Sinai, Egypt, Al Shorouk newspaper
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  
 Repair work was under way, the Cairo-based newspaper
reported. Egypt exports gas through the pipeline to Jordan and
Syria, it said.  
 The newspaper didn’t provide a reason for the attack
although it contained information about confrontations between
Egyptian police and Sinai bedouin tribes.
