             Hong Kong stocks  rose for the first
time in three days, led by developers and oil producers, after
the Standard newspaper said Sino Land Co. sold apartments at
higher prices, and crude prices advanced.  
 Sino Land Co. , the best performer on the Hang Seng Property
Index so far this month, gained 2.2 percent. Cnooc Ltd., China’s
largest offshore oil explorer, climbed 2.5 percent. China
Shenhua Energy Co., the country’s No. 1 coal producer, dropped
2.9 percent after the government told producers to keep prices
of the fuel “stable” to help control inflation.  
 “This is a short-term capital inflow into property
stocks,” said  Castor Pang , Cinda International Ltd.’s research
director in Hong Kong. Energy stocks “will do well as long as
the economy is recovery steadily,” he said.  
 The  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.2 percent to close at 20,726.68,
halting a two-day, 0.8 percent drop. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index  of so-called H-shares of Chinese companies was
little changed at 11,856.55.  
 The Hang Seng Index has dropped 2.4 percent this quarter,
extending its decline this year to 5.2 percent, as worries about
budget deficits in Europe and tighter monetary policy in China
dented confidence in the strength of the global economy.

times  estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov. 16, the
highest level in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

 Sino’s Weekend Sales  
 The Hang Seng Property Index’s 0.5 percent gain was the
biggest among the four industry groups in the  Hang Seng Index .  
 Sixty apartments at the Hermitage, a Sino Land-led
development, sold yesterday at a price 2 percent higher than the
previous batch of releases, the Standard reported, citing an
unidentified employee of the company. The average price of the
units sold yesterday was HK$11,025 ($1,416) a square foot, the
newspaper reported. On June 26, the development sold 231
apartments, the newspaper reported.

plunged 7.2 percent to HK$15.74.  
 Coal Price Measures  
 China’s coal companies were ordered to keep prices in
annual supply contracts stable as the government seeks ways to
manage inflation, the National Development and Reform Commission,
China’s top economic planner, said June 25. Consumer prices rose
3.1 percent in May, the quickest pace in 19 months, according to
government data released June 11.  
 China Shipping Container Lines Co.  increased 1 percent to
HK$2.93. The nation’s second-biggest cargo-box carrier plans to

Manger  Zhao Hongzhou  said June 25.
