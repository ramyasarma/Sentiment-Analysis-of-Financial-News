             Gold may advance for a third day,
approaching a record, as investment demand increases on concern
the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe will be prolonged.  
 Gold for immediate delivery climbed as much as 0.2 percent
to $1,258.60 an ounce and traded at $1,255.85 an ounce at 12:45
p.m. in Singapore. The metal touched an all-time high of
$1,265.30 June 21. August-delivery futures traded at $1,256.70.  
 “Gold is positioned to extend its rise as people still
remain unnerved by the developments in Europe,” said Yu Kyung
Kyu, Seoul-based trader with Eugene Investment & Futures Co.
“That keeps fueling flight-to-quality sentiment,” he said.  
 Gold has climbed 14 percent in 2010, after posting nine
annual gains, as investors seek an alternative to currencies.
Gold reached records this month in euros, sterling, Swiss francs
and yuan. The euro has lost 14 percent this year. “Low
borrowing costs are very supportive of gold,” Yu said.  
 Central banks and governments have kept interest rates low
and spent trillions of dollars to stimulate economies after the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The Federal
Reserve on June 23 retained a pledge to keep the benchmark
interest rate at a record low for an extended period and
signaled that European indebtedness may harm American growth.  
 “Gold is likely to continue its upward climb on follow-
through strength,” Ong Yi Ling, analyst with Phillip Futures
Pte Ltd. in Singapore. “However, on a cautious note as gold
nears its peak, it is increasingly vulnerable to profit-taking.
Should there be a sustained break of the $1,250 level, this
should send alarm bells ringing.”  
 China Gold  
 Funds have flowed to gold from property after the Chinese
government introduced steps to curb gains in the real-estate
market,  Shen Xiangrong , chairman of the Shanghai Gold Exchange,
said at a financial forum in Shanghai on June 25.  
 Gold trading accounts have increased significantly
following the property clampdown, he said. Demand for gold as
wealth protection and a hedge against inflation will support
prices, he said. Gold futures in Shanghai rose to a record
277.01 yuan a gram last week and last traded at 275.72 yuan.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long position in New York gold futures in the week
ended June 22, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  
 Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 238,634 contracts on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Washington-
based commission said in its Commitments of Traders report. Net-
long positions rose by 8,383 contracts, or 4 percent, from a
week earlier.  
 Platinum and palladium, used in auto catalysts, will
“benefit from an improvement in industrial demand from
automotive and chemical industries,”  Hussein Allidina , head of
commodity research with Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report today.  
 Silver climbed 0.3 percent to $19.1425 an ounce, platinum
jumped 1.1 percent to $1,587.75 an ounce and palladium was up
0.8 percent at $482.25.
