             European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Co. Chief Executive Louis Gallois predicted that at some
point in the future, the governments of France and Germany will
each own a so-called golden share in the company, making it
easier for the current shareholder structure to evolve without
creating concerns about takeovers.  
 EADS, created 10 years ago, still obeys a principle of
having balanced shareholdings between its primary French and
Germany owners, with the French state and Lagardere SCA
controlling 22.5 percent and Daimler AG controlling 22.5
percent. Gallois spoke in an interview with French radio
station BFM.
