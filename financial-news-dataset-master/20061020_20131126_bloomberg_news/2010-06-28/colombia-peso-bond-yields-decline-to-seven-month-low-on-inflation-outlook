             Colombia’s peso bond rose, pushing
yields to the lowest level in four years, on speculation that a
report will show inflation remained near a half-century low.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell five basis point, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.8
percent at 2:19 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s
stock exchange. That’s the lowest level on a closing basis since
April 5, 2006. The bond’s price rose 0.388 centavo to 121.742
centavos per peso.  
 Annual  inflation  quickened to 2.22 percent this month from
2.07 percent in May, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of nine economists. That compares to 1.84
percent in March, the lowest level since 1955. A government
report last week that showed the economy expanded a faster-than-
expected 4.4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier is
also helping fuel demand for peso bonds, known as TES, said
 Francisco Chaves , a fixed-income strategist at Bogota-based
brokerage Corredores Asociados SA.  
 “There’s growing appetite for TES,” said Chaves. “Not
only did we have strong growth but inflation isn’t a risk.”  
 The national statistics agency is slated to release the
consumer price index report on July 3. The central bank set a
target for inflation this year of 2 percent to 4 percent.  
 The peso fell for a fourth day, slipping 0.3 percent to
1,906 from 1,899.60 on June 25. The currency is up 7.2 percent
this year, the best performance among 31 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.
