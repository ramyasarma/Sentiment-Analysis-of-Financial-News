             Elevation Partners LP, the private-
equity firm whose founders include  Bono  and  Roger McNamee , added
to its stake in Facebook Inc. with a $120 million investment,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  
 Elevation, which bought the shares from equity owners in
private transactions, has invested a total of $210 million in
Facebook at an average valuation of $14 billion, said the
person, who declined to be named because the recent ownership
hasn’t been publicly disclosed.  
 Facebook, the world’s most popular social-network site with
about 500 million users, is valued at $19.9 billion, according
to  SharesPost  Inc., a marketplace for closely held companies.
Elevation is banking on a bigger gain from Facebook than it
reaped from Palm Inc., which is due to yield about 5 percent
after it was acquired by Hewlett-Packard Co.  
 Elevation, based in Menlo Park, California, is buying
stakes and taking active roles in private Internet companies. In
addition to its previous $90 million investment in Facebook,
Elevation purchased a $100 million stake in business-review site
Yelp Inc. earlier this year. TechCrunch reported on the
additional purchase of Facebook shares earlier today.  
 The Palm investment is Elevation’s biggest bet to date.
 Hewlett-Packard  agreed to buy the smartphone maker in April.
Elevation also owns minority stakes in Forbes Media LLC and real
estate website  Move Inc.   
 Facebook, based in Palo Alto, California, hasn’t set a date
for an initial public offering, Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  said as recently as this month.  
 SharesPost calculates its market valuation of Facebook and
other venture-backed companies by combining recent share
transactions, financing rounds and research estimates. Elevation
spokesman Ron Low and Facebook spokesman  Jonathan Thaw  declined
to comment.
