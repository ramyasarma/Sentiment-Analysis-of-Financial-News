             Vale SA , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, said it named  Guilherme Cavalcanti  as its chief
financial officer, replacing  Fabio Barbosa .  
 Barbosa, 49, is leaving Rio de Janeiro-based Vale to
“pursue new professional challenges,” the company said today
in a regulatory filing, without giving a time frame for when
Cavalcanti’s appointment will take effect. The nomination will
be submitted to the board at the next meeting, Vale said.  
 Cavalcanti has worked as global head of corporate finance
at Vale since 2005. Previously, he worked as treasury director
for Globo Comunicacoes & Participacoes SA and was a board member
for  Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA , Brazil’s largest cable-TV
provider.  
 He has a master’s degree in economics from  Pontificia
Universidade Catolica  in Rio de Janeiro.  
 Barbosa joined Vale in 2002 as its CFO. He formerly held
several Brazilian government positions, including at the
ministry of Industry and Commerce, at the ministry of Labor and
at the ministry of Planning and Budget Management. He also
served as secretary for the National Treasury at the Ministry of
Finance and as an adviser for the World Bank.  
 Vale fell 2.1 percent, the most since June 18, to 41.03
reais at 5:07 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading. The stock has climbed
36 percent this year.
