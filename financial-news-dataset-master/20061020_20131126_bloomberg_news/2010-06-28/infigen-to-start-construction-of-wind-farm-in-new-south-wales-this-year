                  June 28 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) --  Infigen Energy
Ltd.,  an Australian wind energy project developer, decided to
proceed with the construction of the 42-megawatt Woodlawn wind
farm near Bungendore in New South Wales state, the company said.  
 The Woodlawn wind farm adjacent to Infigen’s Capital wind
farm is expected to be completed in the second half of 2011 and
will comprise 20 Suzlon S88 2.1-megawatt turbines acquired by
Infigen last year, the company said today in a statement.  
 Suzlon Energy Ltd.  will also be the turnkey engineering,
procurement and construction provider for the project, Infigen
said. Costs are expected to total about A$100 million ($87
million).  
 Infigen also said it is in discussion with parties
regarding sales arrangements for the output of the wind farm.
The additional capacity will be integrated into its merchant
energy portfolio, which contracts directly with electricity
retailers and major industrial consumers of electricity and
wholesale energy market participants. Infigen holds a New South
Wales retail electricity suppliers license.
