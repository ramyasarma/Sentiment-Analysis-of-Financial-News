             Noble Corp. said it’s agreed to
acquire to privately held FDR Holdings Ltd in a cash transaction
which values the enterprise at $2.16 billion.  
 Frontier is an independent drilling company consisting of
three dynamically positioned drillships, two conventionally
moored drillships including one which is Arctic-class, a
conventionally moored deepwater semisubmersible drilling rig,
and one dynamically positioned floating production, storage,
offloading vessel.  
 The purchase is expected to be funded with a combination
of cash, drawdown on Noble’s existing bank credit facility and
an $800 million bridge credit facility.  
 Noble said it sees the purchase adding to cash flow
immediately and to earnings in 2011.
