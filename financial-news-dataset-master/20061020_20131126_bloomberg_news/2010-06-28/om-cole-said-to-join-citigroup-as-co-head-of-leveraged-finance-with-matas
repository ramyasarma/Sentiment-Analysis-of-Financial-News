             Tom Cole , a former co-head of global
banking Americas at  HSBC Holdings Plc , will join  Citigroup Inc. 
as co-head of leveraged finance with  Barbara Matas , according to
a person familiar with the matter.  
 Cole, 49, will join the Americas Capital Markets
Origination Group effective July 19, reporting to  Richard Zogheb 
and  John Chirico , co-heads of the group, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the information was private.

 Citigroup is the fourth-largest underwriter of U.S. high-
yield bonds this year, with 9.9 percent of the $117.5 billion
underwritten, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the
sixth-biggest underwriter of leveraged loans, with 5.4 percent
of the $159 billion market year to date, Bloomberg data show.
