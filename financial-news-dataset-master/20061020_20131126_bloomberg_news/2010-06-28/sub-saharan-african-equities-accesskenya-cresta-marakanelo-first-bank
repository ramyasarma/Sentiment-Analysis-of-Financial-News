closing level in almost seven weeks.  
 Kenya’s  All-Share Index  rose 0.3 percent to 74.05 at the
close in Nairobi. The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index 
snapped six days of declines, climbing 0.5 percent to 25,284.18
at the close in Lagos, data from the exchange’s website show.
The  Ghana Stock Exchange All-Share Index  dropped for a second

Overall Index  increased 0.3 percent to 753.80.  
 The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  
 AccessKenya Ltd.  (ACCESS KN), the country’s only publicly
traded Internet company, rose for a 10th day, the longest
winning streak on record, climbing 60 cents, or 3.2 percent, to
19.6 shillings. “There are expectations that first-half profit
will be good,”  Gregory Waweru , an analyst at Nairobi-based
Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview
today, without providing details.  
 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization are expected to rise 40 percent for the first six
months through June, the company said May 21.  
 Cresta Marakanelo Ltd.  (CML BG), a Botswanan hotel operator
whose listing is the biggest on the country’s stock exchange in
four years, gained 10 thebe, or 6.9 percent, to 1.55 pula on its
first day of trading in the capital, Gaborone, today. The shares
were sold at 1.45 pula apiece in the company’s initial public
offering.  
 Equity Bank Ltd.  (EQBNK KN), Kenya’s biggest lender by
customers, rose to the highest level in more than a week,
increasing 25 cents, or 1.1 percent, to 23.75 shillings. Chief
Executive Officer  James Mwangi  said the bank expects profit to
increase by more than half this year because of faster growth in
East Africa’s largest economy and investments in Uganda and
Southern Sudan, Mwangi said in an interview at the Fortune
Global Forum in Cape Town on June 26.  
 First Bank of Nigeria Plc  (FIRSTBAN NL), the country’s
biggest bank by market value, advanced 51 kobo, or 3.8 percent,
to 13.85 naira, the biggest increase since May 5. Sanlam Ltd.,
the largest South Africa-based insurer, will team up with the
lender to sell insurance products in the West African nation,
starting as early as next month, Sanlam Chief Executive Officer
 Johan van Zyl  said in an interview at the Fortune Global Forum
in Cape Town yesterday.  
 Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd.  (GCB GN), the West African
nation’s biggest lender, rose 6 pesewas, or 3.9 percent, to 1.62
cedis, the strongest level in a week. Some investors expect it
will report an increase of as much as 25 percent in second-
quarter profit.  
 “We expect GCB to record an increase of between 20 and 25
percent in second-quarter profit over the same quarter last
year,” Hilary Lomotey, a trader with Renaissance Capital, said
by telephone from Accra. “There is speculation that the bank’s
key performance ratios have also improved.”
