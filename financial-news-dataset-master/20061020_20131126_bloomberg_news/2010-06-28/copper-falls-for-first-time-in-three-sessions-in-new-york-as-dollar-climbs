             Copper prices fell for the first
time in three sessions as the dollar’s advance curbed demand for
the metal as an alternative investment.  
 The  greenback  rose as much as 0.6 percent against a basket
of six currencies, heading for the first gain in four sessions.
The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials declined as
much as 1 percent. Copper has dropped 7.7 percent this year on
concern that slowing economic growth will reduce consumption of
the metal used in pipes and wires.  
 “The dollar is hurting most of the commodities today,”
said  Michael K. Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options in
Port St. Lucie, Florida. “There’s also still a lot of concern
about growth and talk of a double-dip recession. Until those
fears subside, copper is going to have a hard time.”  
 Copper futures for September delivery fell 2.15 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $3.0895 a pound on the Comex in New York. The
price is poised for the third straight monthly drop.  
 The metal fluctuated between gains and losses today after a
Commerce Department report showed U.S. spending increased 0.2
percent in May.  
 “The numbers suggests that the U.S. economic recovery
remains on track, though the pace is probably a bit slow for
most people’s liking,” said  David Thurtell , an analyst at
Citigroup Inc. in London.  
 On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $42, or 0.6 percent, to $6,812 a metric ton
($3.09 a pound).  
 Nickel, aluminum, lead and tin prices rose on the LME. Zinc
dropped.
