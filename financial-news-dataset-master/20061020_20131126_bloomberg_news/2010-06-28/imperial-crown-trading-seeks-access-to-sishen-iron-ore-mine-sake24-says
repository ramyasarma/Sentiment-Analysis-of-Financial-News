             Imperial Crown Trading has asked 
Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. for access to the Sishen Iron mine in South
Africa to explore how it can excercise its partial prospecting 
rights to the property, Sake24 said, citing Jagdish Parekh, a 
shareholder in the company.  
 Kumba has denied Imperial Crown access because aerial 
surveys would halt blasting at the site, the Johannesburg-based
Internet news service said, citing Robert Botha, the company’s 
legal head.
