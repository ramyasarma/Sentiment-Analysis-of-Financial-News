             Rupert Murdoch ’s  News Corp.’ s
proposed takeover  of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc  may take
one year, according to a BSkyB board member.  
 It may take about 12 months for News Corp. to gain full
control of BSkyB, board member  Thomas Mockridge  said today at a
press conference in Italy.  
 News Corp. and BSkyB have said they plan to work together
to seek approval from regulators for a takeover that would be
Murdoch’s largest acquisition. The process may take six months
or more, News Corp. Chief Operating Officer  Chase Carey  said
June 15.  
 The “real message” behind the purchase is that “Rupert
and James believe that pay-TV is the best investment in the
media industry,” Mockridge, who is also chief executive of Sky
Italia SpA, said today.  James Murdoch , the son of Rupert
Murdoch, is chairman of BSkyB.  
 BSkyB, the U.K.’s largest pay-TV provider, spurned a 7.8
billion-pound ($11.75 billion) offer from News Corp., the owner
of the Wall Street Journal, for the 61 percent stake it doesn’t
already own. In the U.K., News Corp. owns the Times, Sunday
Times and the Sun newspapers.  
 Separately, Sky Italia, News Corp.’s Italian satellite TV
unit, had “very strong and positive growth” in the quarter
ended June, Mockridge said.
