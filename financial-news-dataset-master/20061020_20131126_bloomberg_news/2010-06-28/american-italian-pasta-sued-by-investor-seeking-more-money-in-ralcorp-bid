             American Italian Pasta Co. , the
biggest maker of dry pasta in North America, was sued by a
shareholder seeking to force a higher price for the company than
its planned $1.2 billion takeover by  Ralcorp Holdings Inc.   
 The shareholder, Andrew Klenck, contends directors of
Italian American, which makes pasta in about 300 shapes and
sizes, are duty-bound to get the best price for the stock and
that the $53- a-share Ralcorp offer is unfair.  
 “The company reported strong key  measurements ” for the
second quarter,” and “has willingly entered into the proposed
transaction to the detriment of its shareholders,” Klenck said
in a complaint filed today in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington.  
 Kansas City, Missouri-based American Italian announced June
21 it would be bought by Ralcorp, of St. Louis, in a cash
transaction expected to close by Sept. 30. Italian American’s
brands include Mueller’s and Golden Grain. Ralcorp’s food brands
include Ralston and Ry-Krisp.  
 “The company declines to comment” on the lawsuit, said
 Andrew Siegel , a spokesman for American Italian in New York.  
 Shares of American Italian rose 2 cents to $52.86 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading at 1:36 p.m. in New York after rising to a
52-week high of $52.89 earlier in the day.  
 The case is Klenck v. American Italian Past Co., CA5603,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).
