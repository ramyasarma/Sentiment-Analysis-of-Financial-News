             Corn and soybeans may fall this week
on speculation that drier, cooler weather will boost U.S. crop
yields.  
 Twelve of 21 traders and analysts surveyed from Chicago to
Tokyo on June 25 said corn will fall, and 11 said soybeans will
decline. Last week, corn futures for December delivery fell 5.3
percent to $3.605 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and
soybeans for November delivery dropped 2 percent to $9.12 a
bushel.  
 Last week’s declines in corn and soybean futures were
unexpected by analysts surveyed on June 18. Since 2004, the
surveys have forecast weekly moves accurately 50 percent of the
time for corn and 53 percent for soybeans.  
 Bullish  on corn: 9  Bullish  on soybeans: 10
 Bearish  on corn: 12  Bearish  on soybeans: 11
