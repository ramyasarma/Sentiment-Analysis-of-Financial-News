             Carbon allowances in the  European
Union ’s emissions trading system, the world’s largest, was
little changed near a three-week low as crude oil dropped.  
 EU permits for December rose 0.3 percent to 15.47 euros a
metric ton as of 10 a.m. on London’s European Climate
Exchange, extending their gain in the second quarter to 21
percent. They touched 15.08 euros on June 25, the lowest level
since June 7.  
 Brent crude for August delivery lost 0.5 percent to $77.71
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Oil
can influence carbon prices because it’s linked to economic
output and to cleaner-burning natural gas in Europe.
