             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index fell as
declines in commodity prices overshadowed a central bank survey
that showed economists forecast faster growth with lower
inflation.  
 State oil producer  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  dropped to the
lowest price in a month as crude prices retreated from a seven-
week high.  Gerdau SA , Latin America’s largest steelmaker, slid
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended selling the stock.
Losses were limited as retailer  Lojas Renner SA  rose to a record
and homebuilder  Rossi Residencial SA  gained amid speculation
faster economic expansion will boost consumer spending.  
 The  Bovespa  stock index lost 0.9 percent to 64,225.22.
Thirty-eight stocks fell on the measure while 25 rose. The
 BM&FBovespa Small Cap  index gained 0.8 percent to 1,178. The
real was little changed at 1.7808 per dollar after rising the
previous three days.  
 “Brazil’s economy continues to be very, very strong,”
said  Guilherme Figueiredo , who helps manage $1.3 billion in
assets at M. Safra in Sao Paulo. “The market is continuing to
analyze where the global economy is going, if the slowdown is
going to be stronger, or if growth will be lower but more
sustainable. There isn’t a clear outlook for how things will
turn out, which leaves the market very uncomfortable.”  
 Brazilian  stocks  completed a third week of gains on June
25, helping push the Bovespa up 11 percent from a May 20 low.  
 Inflation Forecasts  
 Brazil’s inflation rate may accelerate less than previously
forecast while the economy may expand at the fastest pace since
1994, according to the median estimates in a central bank survey
of 100 economists published today.  
 Inflation may reach 5.55 percent by year-end, compared with
a week-earlier forecast of 5.61 percent, while the economy may
expand 7.13 percent, up from 7.06 percent previously, the survey
showed.  
 Leaders of the Group of 20 nations endorsed targets to cut
deficits while pledging to maintain existing stimulus plans to
sustain economic expansion.  
 Advanced economies will aim to at least halve deficits by
2013 and stabilize their debt-to-output ratios by 2016 while
taking “concerted actions” to boost growth, leaders from the
G-20 nations said in a statement after meeting in Toronto.  
 The meeting failed to provide a clear signal to markets on
the direction of the global economic recovery, according to
Figueiredo of M. Safra.  
 ‘Draconian’ Targets  
 Brazilian Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  on June 26 said
the deficit targets were “draconian.”  
 Gerdau SA , Latin America’s largest steelmaker, fell 1.5
percent to 24.75 reais after Goldman Sachs cut its
recommendation to “sell” from “neutral.”  
 Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA  gained 1 percent to
51.55 reais after Goldman Sachs said the company is its top pick
among Brazilian steelmakers.  Usiminas , as the company is known,
is especially attractive on valuation and the prospect that it
may sell iron-ore assets, Goldman Sachs analysts including
 Marcelo Aguiar  wrote in a note to clients today, reiterating the
“neutral” rating on the stock.  
 Petrobras slid 1.8 percent to 27.42 reais, its seventh
decline in eight sessions, while  Vale SA , the world’s largest
iron-ore producer, lost 2.2 percent to 41.01 reais.  Lojas Renner
SA , Brazil’s biggest publicly traded clothing retailer, jumped
4.2 percent to 51 reais. Rossi increased 1.9 percent to 13.80
reais.  
 Stock trading today was the slowest this year as Brazil’s
national soccer team faced Chile, beating its rival 3-0 to
secure a place in the World Cup quarterfinals. The previous 2010
lows were June 15 and June 25, when Brazil played North Korea
and Portugal.  
 The Bovespa index  trades  for 12.4 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.4 times for the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index  of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.6
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.9 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
