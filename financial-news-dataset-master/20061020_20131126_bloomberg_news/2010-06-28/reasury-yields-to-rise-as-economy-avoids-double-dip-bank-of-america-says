             Treasury 10-year note yields will
increase as much as 72 basis points from the lowest level since
April 2009 by year-end as the U.S. economy avoids a double-dip
recession, according to Bank of America Corp.  
 “Data will ultimately tip in favor of higher rates,”
 Priya Misra , head of U.S. rates strategy in New York, said at a
press briefing today. “Then investors will start looking to
selling rates.”  
 Bank of America expects the 10-year yield to rise to 3.25
percent “in the near term” and reach 3.75 percent by the end
of 2010. The yield will reach 3.15 percent by the end of the
second quarter and 3.74 percent at year-end, according to the
average forecast of 64 economists in a Bloomberg News survey,
with the most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  
 The yield on the 10-year note fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 3.04 percent, according to BGCantor
Market Data. It earlier touched 3.0245 percent, the lowest level
since April 29, 2009. The yield dropped to its all-time low of
2.0352 percent on Dec. 18, 2008, in the aftermath of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy.  
 U.S. debt rallied today as a report showed inflation was
contained last month and economists said nonfarm payrolls
figures later this week will show employers eliminated 115,000
jobs in June. Group of 20 leaders said over the weekend that
advanced economies plan to cut their deficits in half by 2013,
allowing them to curb record bond sales.  
 Two-Year Yield  
 The two-year note  yield  fell two basis points to 0.63
percent after earlier dropping to 0.62 percent, the lowest level
since Nov. 27. The yield is approaching the record low of 0.6044
percent set Dec. 17, 2008, after the Federal Reserve cut its
target for overnight lending to a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  
 Much of the negative economic expectations have been priced
into shorter-term debt, according to Misra. While reports show
the recovery may be slowing, only indications of something more
serious than a reduction in the pace of growth will bring
Treasury yields lower, she said.  
 “If you’re looking to go lower, it has to be on risk of
double-dip or another recession,” Misra said.  
 U.S. economic reports will have more of an effect on
Treasuries than Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis or China’s plan
to let its currency appreciate, she said.
