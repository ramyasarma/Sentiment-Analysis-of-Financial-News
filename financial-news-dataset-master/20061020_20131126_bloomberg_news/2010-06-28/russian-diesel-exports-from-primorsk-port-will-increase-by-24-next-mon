             Russian exports of low-sulfur diesel
from the port of Primorsk on the Baltic Sea will rise 24 percent
in July, the highest in at least four months.  
 Exports will increase by 121,000 metric tons to 635,000
tons in July from 514,000 tons this month and 520,000 tons in
May, according to two people with knowledge of the loading
schedules.  
 Diesel exports from Primorsk totaled 170,000 tons in April
as TNK-BP completed maintenance at its 340,000 barrel-a-day
Ryazan refinery and OAO Slavneft finished repair works on its
290,000 barrel-a-day Yanos refinery at the end of that month. In
March 450,000 to 500,000 tons of the fuel was shipped.  
 Low-sulfur diesel from Russian refiners such as OAO Lukoil,
 OAO Gazprom  and TNK-BP, is typically transported through the OAO
Transneft-operated oil-product pipeline to Primorsk, then loaded
onto tankers and shipped to Europe.  
 Northwest European low-sulfur diesel cargo swaps for July
were at a premium of $16.44 a ton to July ICE gasoil futures on
June 25, the lowest since December 4, 2009.  
 The premium of gasoil over Brent crude, or crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, was at $12.55 a barrel at 9:12 a.m.
on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, down from $12.64 on
June 25. Gasoil includes diesel and heating fuel.
