             Rio Tinto Group  shareholders may
vote down a proposed iron ore venture with BHP Billiton Ltd.
because of the terms of payment, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc said.  
 “We continue to believe that Rio shareholders will not
vote for the joint venture under the current payment terms,”
RBS analyst  Lyndon Fagan  said yesterday in a report after
meeting with Rio’s Chief Executive Officer  Tom Albanese . “The
iron ore joint venture synergies were acknowledged, but no
comments on a potential change in structure of the equalization
payment were provided.”  
 BHP agreed to pay Rio $5.8 billion to equalize its
contribution of assets to the venture. Rio and  BHP , the world’s
second-and third-largest iron ore exporters, plan to combine
mines, railroads, ports and workforces in Western Australia in a
50-50 joint venture to save at least $10 billion.  
 The deal needs shareholder and regulatory approval and is
opposed by steelmakers in Europe and Asia.
