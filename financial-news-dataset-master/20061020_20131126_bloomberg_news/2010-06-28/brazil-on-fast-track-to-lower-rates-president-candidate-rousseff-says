             Brazil is on a “fast track” to
lower interest rates, presidential candidate Dilma Rousseff said
today in an interview to TV Cultura network’s Roda Viva.  
 Brazil needs to decrease nominal budget defict and debt in
relation to the country’s gross domestic product to be able to
cut rates in a “sustainable” way, Rousseff said. The country’s
economy needs to grow 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent a year from
2011 to 2014 to reach an “international level” for its
interest rates, she told the panel in the TV show, which was
broadcast on its website.  
 Lowering the country’s interest rates in the short term
would be “a concern” because of current international
situation, Rousseff said.
