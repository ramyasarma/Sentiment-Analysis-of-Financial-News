             Baosteel Group Corp. , China’s
second-biggest steelmaker, scaled back its 2012 capacity target 
by 38 percent amid calls by the government to curb overcapacity 
and focus on improving quality.  
 Baosteel is targeting capacity of 50 million metric tons by
2012, and 66 million tons by 2015, the Shanghai-based steelmaker
said in a  statement  on its website today. The company in
September 2007 said it wanted to boost capacity to 80 million
tons by 2012.  
 China, the biggest steelmaking nation, has pulled back from
encouraging mills to get as large as global leader  ArcelorMittal 
as it sought to shutter old plants, curb pollution and power
demand. Chinese steelmakers are likely to cut output in the
third quarter because of weak demand, Baosteel said this month.  
 “The world economic recovery path will be bumpy,
unpredictable and long,” Baosteel said in its statement today.
“China’s economic restructuring will bring uncertainties during
the 2010 and 2015 period.”  
 Steelmakers may have low profit margins and the industry
will enter a slow-growth period, the company said. Steel
production in China jumped 14 percent to a record 568 million
tons last year as government stimulus measures boosted demand.  
 Mergers and Acquisitions  
 Baosteel, which made 38.9 million tons of crude steel last
year, will expand capacity partly through mergers and
acquisitions, and will focus on improving product and cost
competitiveness, the company said.  
 For its overseas strategy, the steelmaker plans to focus on
raw materials, improve sales and services, as well as building
steel plants, it said without giving details.  
 The Chinese government wants to have three to five
steelmakers with 50 million tons of annual capacity, Miao Wei,
vice minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, said in February.  
 Earlier plans to ask steelmakers to merge to create one or
two producers with annual capacity of 100 million tons by 2015,
rivaling ArcelorMittal, were reconsidered after the global
economic crisis, Li Xinchuang, who was helping to draft a new
steel policy as head of the China Metallurgical Industry
Planning & Research Institute, said in February.
