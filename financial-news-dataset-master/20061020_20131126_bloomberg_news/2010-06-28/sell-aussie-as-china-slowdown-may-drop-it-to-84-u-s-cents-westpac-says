             Investors may benefit from selling
the Australian dollar against the greenback as it may decline 4
percent as China’s economy slows, Westpac Banking Corp. said.  
 Investors should sell the so-called Aussie as it gains
toward 88.15 cents, looking for it to drop initially to 84
cents, the Sydney-based bank said today in an e-mailed note to
clients. They should exit the trade if the Australian dollar
rises above 89 cents, it said. The currency traded at 87.51 U.S.
cents as of 3:40 p.m. in Sydney.
