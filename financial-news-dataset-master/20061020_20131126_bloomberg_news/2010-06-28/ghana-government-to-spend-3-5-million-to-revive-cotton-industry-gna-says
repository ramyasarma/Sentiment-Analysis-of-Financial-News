             Ghana’s government will spend 5
million cedis ($3.5 million) to revive cotton production this
year, Vice President  John Mahama  was cited as saying by the
Ghana News Agency.  
 Mahama, who announced the initiative on June 26, said the
project is aimed at producing 10,000 metric tons of cotton
annually, the news agency reported on the same day. Ghana will
spend 3.5 million cedis on support for the cotton industry and
1.5 million cedis in subsidies to farmers, he said.  
 Ghanaian cotton output begin dwindling in the 1980s after a
boom in the previous two decades, due to high costs and soil
infertility, the news service cited Mahama as saying. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s monthly cotton report showed Ghana’s
production at zero.
