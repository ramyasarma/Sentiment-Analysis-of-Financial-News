             Efforts to rescue 107 people buried
by a landslide in the southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou
were suspended last night because of continuing rain and
concerns the downpours may trigger additional landslides, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.  
 Chances of survival for those buried are “quite slim,”
Xinhua cited Luo Ning, mayor of Anshun city who was leading the
rescue effort, as saying. More than 600 soldiers and local
residents participated in the rescue efforts, Xinhua said.  
 The landslide occured in Dazhai village of Gangwu township,
which is under the jurisdication of the city of Anshun,
yesterday at 2:30 p.m. local time, Xinhua reported. Gangwu
township received a daily record of 257 millimeters of rain on
June 27 and may get an additional 30 millimeters to 40
millimeters today, Xinhua reported.
