             Caterpillar Inc. , the world’s
largest maker of construction equipment, agreed to buy out its
partner in a Chinese joint venture as part of its plans to
expand excavator production in the country.  
 The Peoria, Illinois-based company agreed to buy Xuzhou
Construction Machinery Group’s 16 percent stake in Caterpillar
Xuzhou Ltd., a joint venture established in 1995, for an
undisclosed amount, Caterpillar said today in a statement.  
 Caterpillar said it’s expanding excavator production in
Xuzhou, China. The company held a groundbreaking ceremony today
in the city for a plant that will build large excavators. The
new factory will help increase Caterpillar’s excavator capacity
in China by fivefold through 2014.  
 “In the next few years, we expect China to continue to
invest heavily across the country in a wide range of
infrastructure improvements,”  Rich Lavin , Caterpillar group
president with responsibility for emerging markets, said in the
statement. “It is critical for Caterpillar and its dealer
network to continue investing in China.”  
 Caterpillar raised its 2010 earnings forecast in April
because of growth in Asia and Latin America. The Chinese
government’s stimulus program and an increase in lending helped
both residential and non-residential construction increase in
the first quarter, Caterpillar said at the time.  
 Caterpillar  fell 31 cents to $64.40 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 13
percent this year.
