             Senator Robert C. Byrd, the 
longest-serving member of Congress, died over the weekend at 
the age of 92, the Charleston Gazette reported, without saying 
where it got the information.  
 Byrd, who was hospitalized last week for heat exhaustion 
and dehydration, was described by his doctors at the time as 
“seriously ill,” the newspaper said. An official announcement
of his death may be made soon, the newspaper added.
