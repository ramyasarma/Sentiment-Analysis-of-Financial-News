             Banco Popolare SC  was rated “buy”
at Societe Generale SA, which initiated coverage of Italy’s
fourth-biggest bank and set a price estimate of 5.9 euros.  
 “Banco Popolare is a restructuring story, with significant
upside potential,” Paris-based analyst  Carlo Tommaselli  wrote
in a note today.  
 Under the brokerage’s “best-case scenario, non-core assets
disposals reach 700 million euros ($865.6 million) and could add
0.7 euro per share,” he said. “Furthermore, we calculate a
return to long-term normalized profitability would bring the
valuation to 7 euros per share.”  
 Banco Popolare rose 1.1 percent to 4.62 euros at 9:14 a.m.
in Milan.
