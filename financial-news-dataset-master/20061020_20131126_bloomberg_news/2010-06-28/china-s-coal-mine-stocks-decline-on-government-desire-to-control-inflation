             China Coal Energy Co.  led Chinese
coal stocks lower in Hong Kong and Shanghai trading after the
government told producers to keep prices of the fuel “stable”
as part of efforts to control inflation.  
 China Coal, a unit of the nation’s second-biggest producer,
fell as much as 6 percent in Hong Kong and was trading at
HK$10.68 at 11:05 a.m.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. , the fourth-
biggest supplier, declined as much as 4.1 percent. The benchmark
Hang Seng index gained 0.7 percent. Both stocks declined more
than 1 percent in Shanghai.  
 China’s coal companies were ordered to keep prices agreed
in annual supply contracts stable as the government seeks ways
to manage inflation, the National Development and Reform
Commission, China’s top economic planner, said on June 25.
Consumer prices rose 3.1 percent in May, the quickest pace in 19
months, according to government data released June 11.  
 “This amounts to a cap on coal prices and this has affected
sentiment for coal stocks,” said  Michelle Leung , an analyst at
CIMB-GK Securities in Hong Kong. “Coal companies are still
making good profits, but there’s no indication as to how long
they may have to cap prices which raises concerns about future
margins,” she said.  
 Coal prices rose about 30 percent in the first six months
compared with the same period last year as China’s economy
rebounded, according to Leung. Curbs on coal prices will help
reduce costs at state-owned companies, Leung said.
