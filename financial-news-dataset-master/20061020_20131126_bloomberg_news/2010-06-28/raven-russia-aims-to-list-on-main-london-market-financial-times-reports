             Raven Russia Ltd., a Guernsey-based
property company that specializes in warehouses in Russia, plans
to move from London’s Alternative Investment Market to the main
London market this year, the Financial Times reported.  
 The company is likely to announce today that it meets
listing requirements, the newspaper said, citing unidentified
people close to the talks.  
 Raven Russia hopes a listing on the main market will enable
it to attract more international investors, especially from the
U.S., the FT said, adding that Raven Russia declined to comment.
