             - Vallourec SA has seen a rebound in
volumes after a low point reached in the first quarter, Chairman
Philippe Crouzet told La Tribune in an interview.  
 The company is benefiting from a recovery in the U.S.,
Brazil and Asia, while the economy in Europe is “less good,”
Crouzet told the newspaper.  
 Vallourec, which produces steel pipes for the oil and gas
industry, may benefit in the medium term from the Gulf of Mexico
oil spill as clients raise the technical specifications on
projects, Crouzet was cited as saying.
