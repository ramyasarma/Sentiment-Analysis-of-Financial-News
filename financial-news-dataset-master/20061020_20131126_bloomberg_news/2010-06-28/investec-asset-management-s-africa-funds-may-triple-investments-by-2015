             Investec Asset Management, the South
African money manager with $70 billion in assets, said its
investments in Africa, excluding South Africa, may triple in the
next two to five years as investors seek growth markets.  
 “The growth outlook in the developed world is not
compelling and frontier markets are demanding attention, with
Africa at the forefront of that,” John Green, director of
global business development, said in an interview from Cape
Town today. “We believe in the pan-African investment story and
that it is sustainable.”  
 Of the $70 billion Investec Asset Management oversees
globally, $27 billion is in South Africa and $3 billion in the
rest of the continent, Green said. This may climb to more than
$10 billion in the next two to five years, he said.  
 Outside of South Africa, Investec invests in Egypt,
Morocco, Kenya, Nigeria and West Africa’s Abidjan, Ivory Coast-
based Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres regional exchange,
through a combination of public and private equity and public
and private debt, he said.
