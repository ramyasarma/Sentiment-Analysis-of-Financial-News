             The euro-region fiscal crisis may
force China to allow the yuan to trade freely as it runs out of
places to invest its foreign-exchange reserves, said Bank of New
York Mellon Corp.  
 “China is now as concerned for the outlook for investments
denominated in euros as they are about their holdings in the
U.S. dollar,” Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY
Mellon in London, wrote in a research report today. “The only
real way that China can deal with this investment conundrum is
to stop accumulating foreign-exchange reserves that need to be
invested in the first place.”  
 “The issue cannot truly go away until currency
liberalization takes place, thereby removing the need for the
central bank to be active in the market on a daily basis,” he
said.  
 It may take “several more years” before the topic is
considered by senior politicians in China, he said.  
 The yuan weakened by less than 0.1 percent to 6.7960 per
dollar as of 10:47 a.m. in London.
