             Most Asian  stocks  rose, led by
financial and phone companies.  
 Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. advanced 1.7 percent after the
casualty insurer said it will buy back shares.  Nippon Telegraph
& Telephone Co.  gained 1.2 percent after the Nikkei newspaper
said its NTT Finance Corp. unit may post its first operating
profit in three years.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.2 percent to 115.85 as
of 9:36 a.m. in Tokyo. The gauge has slumped 10 percent from its
high this year on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and
Chinese measures to control property prices will hurt the global
economy.  
 Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 0.6 percent and
South Korea’s Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 0.3 percent, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
declined 0.3 percent.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  increased 0.3
percent. The index fell 0.2 percent yesterday, dragging the
gauge lower for the fifth time in six days, as oil and metal
prices dropped.
