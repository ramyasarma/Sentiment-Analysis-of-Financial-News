             (Corrects amount of bank losses in fourth paragraph.)  
 European banks may struggle to
refinance their debt if investor sentiment remains negative,
the Bank for International Settlements said.  
 “As recent disruptions in funding markets have shown,
banks can face significant refinancing pressures when sentiment
turns adverse,” the Basel, Switzerland-based BIS said in its
annual report published today. “Although banks in the crisis
countries have made some progress in repairing their balance
sheets, this process is far from complete.”  
 Investors are shunning bank securities on concern Greek,
Portuguese, Spanish and Irish government bonds held by the
lenders may plunge in value in the event of a restructuring.
Banks have about 60 percent of their long-term debt maturing
over the next three years, the BIS said. Funding maturities have
also shortened to the lowest level in 30 years, exacerbating
refinancing needs.  
 Banks are repairing their balance sheets after logging
about $1.31 trillion of losses and writedowns since the start of
the credit crisis. Lenders had raised about $1.24 trillion in
new capital by the middle of April, the BIS said.  
 Banks are still too reliant on foreign-exchange swap
markets to finance the estimated $7 trillion they have in U.S.
dollar-denominated assets, the BIS said. Lenders in the region
have turned to the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve
for help because those markets recently dried up, according to
the report.
