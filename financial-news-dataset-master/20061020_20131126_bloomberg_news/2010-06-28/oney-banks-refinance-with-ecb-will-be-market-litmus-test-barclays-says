             The amount of money that lenders
refinance with the European Central Bank at the end of June will
be a “litmus test” for bank funding in the region, Barclays
Capital said.  
 Banks need to repay 442 billion euros ($546 billion) of 12-
month cash to the ECB on July 1. Banks will be able to roll over
some of these loans on less attractive terms at an auction of
three-month ECB cash on June 30, London-based analyst  Simon Samuels  wrote in a note to clients today.  
 “Borrowing less than 250 billion euros might be seen as a
bullish signal for the market because banks are finding it
easier to fund themselves,” Samuels said. “Borrowing more than
300 billion euros could be a negative signal because banks are
more reliant on the ECB than we thought. The risks for European
bank equities from the forthcoming ECB auction are more to the
downside.”  
 The ECB flooded Europe’s financial system with long-term
funding after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
caused a worldwide recession. The sovereign debt crisis sparked
a second round of risk aversion as investors shunned bank
securities on concern Greek, Portuguese and Spanish bonds held
by the lenders will plunge in value.  
 “The simple fact that the European banking system is about
to enter the fourth year of not being able to fund itself
properly is symptomatic of the wider funding challenges facing
the sector,” Samuels said.
