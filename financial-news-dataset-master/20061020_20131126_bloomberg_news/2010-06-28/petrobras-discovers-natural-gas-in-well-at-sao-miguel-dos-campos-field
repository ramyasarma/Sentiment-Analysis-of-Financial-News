             Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, found evidence of gas in an
onshore well in Brazil’s Cidade de Sao Miguel dos Campos field,
the Brazilian petroleum regulator said.  
 The discovery was made at the 3BRSA829DPAL well in the
Alagoas basin, the National Petroleum Agency said on its Web
site. The Sao Miguel dos Campos field was declared a commercial
find in February 2008.
