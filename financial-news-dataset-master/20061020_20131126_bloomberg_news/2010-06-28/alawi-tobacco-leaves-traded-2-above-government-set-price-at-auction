             The average price of tobacco in
 Malawi , the world’s largest producer of burley tobacco, traded 2
percent above the government-set price of $2 last week, Auction
Holdings Ltd. said.  
 The leaf sold at $2.04 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) in the
week through June 25, compared with $2.10 a week earlier, the
Lilongwe-based manager of Malawi’s auction floors said in a
statement published in the Daily Times newspaper today. During
the week, 8.9 million kilograms of tobacco worth $18.4 million
was sold, it said.  
 Malawi began setting minimum prices for the various grades
of tobacco in 2007, after accusing merchants of putting growers
out of business by offering them lower prices. Last year,
President  Bingu wa Mutharika  deported four officials at three
tobacco-buying companies, accusing them of sabotaging his
economic agenda.  
 Tobacco is Malawi’s biggest foreign-exchange earner,
accounting for 60 percent of all revenue earned from abroad.
Limbe Leaf Tobacco Co., a unit of  Universal Corp. , Alliance One
Inc., Africa Leaf Malawi Ltd., Premium Tama Tobacco Ltd., Malawi
Leaf Co., RWJ Wallace Ltd. and Japan Tobacco Inc. are among the
biggest buyers of tobacco in Malawi. They export the leaves to
countries in Europe, Asia and North America.  
 Since sales began on March 15, 121.2 million kilograms of
tobacco has been sold, generating revenue of $240.5 million. The
leaf has sold at an average of $1.98 per kilogram.
