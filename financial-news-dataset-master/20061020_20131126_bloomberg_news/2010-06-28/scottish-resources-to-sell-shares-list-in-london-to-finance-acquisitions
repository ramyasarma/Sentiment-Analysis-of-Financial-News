             Scottish Resources Group Plc , the
largest surface-mining coal producer in the U.K., plans to raise
25 million pounds ($37.6 million) in an initial public offering
to fund acquisitions.  
 Scottish Resources will seek to trade its shares on the
main market of the London Stock Exchange, the Gartlove,
Scotland-based company said today in a statement. Panmure Gordon
& Co. is running the listing, which is scheduled to take place
in mid-to-late July.  
 The company needs to refinance the acquisition of a mining
site with about 600,000 metric tons of coal and to accelerate
the purchase of “certain third-party rights” to one of its
properties, Scottish Resources said in the statement. It has
nine operating surface coal-mine sites in Scotland and produced
20 percent of the U.K.’s coal output last year, according to the
company.
