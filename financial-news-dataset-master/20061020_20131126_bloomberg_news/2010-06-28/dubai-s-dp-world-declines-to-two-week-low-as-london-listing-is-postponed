             DP World Ltd.  slumped to the lowest
level in almost two weeks after the Dubai government-owned port
operator decided to postpone the listing of its shares on the
London Stock Exchange.  
 DP World shares declined for a fifth day, plunging 6.8
percent to 45 cents in Dubai, the lowest intraday level since
June 15, at 10:29 a.m. in the emirate.  
 The company “has decided to postpone the listing process
until an acceptable system that supports the dual listing is
available,” DP World said in a statement on Nasdaq Dubai today.
The company will consider listing shares in London after the
publication of its 2010 financial results.
