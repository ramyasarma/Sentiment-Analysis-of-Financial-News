             Grupo Sacresa, a Barcelona-based
real estate company, filed for protection from creditors after
talks to restructure 1.8 billion euros ($2.2 billion) of debt
failed to win sufficient support from lenders.  
 The company filed the request at Mercantile Court Number
Two in Barcelona today, it said in a regulatory filing. Cresa
Patrimonial, Sacresa Terrenos Promocion, Sacresa Terrenos 2 and
Sanahuja Escofet Inmobiliaria are the four units included in the
filing, it said.
