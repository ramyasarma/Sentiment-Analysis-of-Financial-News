             Essar Oil Ltd., the second-biggest
non-state refiner, gained in Mumbai trading after India scrapped
subsidies on gasoline.  
 The largest private fuel retailer is set to benefit
“significantly” from India’s decision to partially deregulate
fuel prices, Nitin Sharma, an analyst at JP Morgan Cazenove
Ltd., wrote in a note to clients.
