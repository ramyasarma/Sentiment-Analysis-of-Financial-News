             Iron Ore Holdings Ltd. , controlled
by Australian billionaire  Kerry Stokes , fell to a 17-month low
in Sydney trading after saying it’s so far failed to reach a
sales agreement with Rio Tinto Group.  
 Iron Ore Holdings, based in Perth,  fell  15 percent to
A$1.50 on the Australian stock exchange, the lowest closing
price since Jan. 19, 2009.  
 “If the parties are unable to agree the terms of access by
August 8, then the ore sales agreement will automatically
terminate,” Iron Ore Holdings said today in a statement. “The
effect of termination of the ore sales agreement is that the
relationship agreement will also terminate.”  
 Rio Tinto , the world’s second-biggest exporter of iron ore,
said in November it was evaluating Iron Ore Holding’s Iron
Valley deposit in Western Australia’s Pilbara region and may buy
all or part of the project. The London-based company also said
it agreed to buy 1.5 million metric tons of iron ore from Iron
Ore Holding’s Phil’s Creek project.  
 Iron Ore Holdings has 400 million metric tons of resources,
the company said today. Iron Valley is 10 kilometers (6.2 miles)
from Rio’s Yandicoogina mine.  
 “Rio Tinto have advised that it does not believe Iron Ore
Holdings has complied with its obligations under the ore sales
agreement,” it said in today’s statement. “Iron Ore Holdings
does not agree with Rio Tinto.”  
 David Luff , a spokesman for London-based Rio, wasn’t
immediately available to comment.  
 Stokes owns a 51.1 percent stake in Iron Ore Holdings
through Wroxby Pty Ltd., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.
