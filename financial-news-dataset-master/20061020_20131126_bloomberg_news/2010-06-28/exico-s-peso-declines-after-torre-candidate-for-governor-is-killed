             Mexico’s peso fell after the leading
candidate for governor in the border state of Tamaulipas was
gunned down in the highest profile killing of a politician since
1994, fueling concern companies may cut back on investment in
the country.  
 The currency dropped 0.4 percent to 12.6990 per dollar at
2:37 p.m. New York time, from 12.6490 on June 25. Government
peso-denominated bonds erased gains.  
 Rodolfo Torre, a 46-year-old member of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, was killed in Tamaulipas state, said
Interior Minister  Fernando Gomez Mont  in a press conference
broadcast on television today.  
 “The market flipped suddenly a few minutes after the news
of the candidate’s murder,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency
strategist at Base Internacional Casa de Bolsa SA in Monterrey,
Mexico. “This isn’t going to be a long-term risk, because we
have been seeing this kind of violence in the country for two or
three years now.”  
 Torre had 61 percent support for the July 4 election,
compared with 30 percent for Jose Julian Sacramento, of the
National Action party, according to a June 12-16 poll by Mexico
City-based Consulta Mitofsky that had a margin of error of 1
percentage point.  
 Presidential candidate  Luis Donaldo Colosio  was killed
March 23, 1994, in Tijuana. The killing shook investor
confidence and was one of the factors that led to a peso
devaluation that December.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.23 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.08 centavo to 124.77 centavos per peso.  
 Torre’s killing “provoked the peso to start dropping,”
said  Omar Martin del Campo , a trader at Banco Ve Por Mas SA in
Mexico City. “This situation isn’t anything new, and the market
is starting to discount it already.”  
 More than 22,000 people have died in drug trafficking-
related violence in Mexico since President  Felipe Calderon  took
office in 2006.
