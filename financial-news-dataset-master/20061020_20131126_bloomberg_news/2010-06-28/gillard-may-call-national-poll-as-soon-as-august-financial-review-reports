             Prime Minister Julia Gillard may
seek an early election after making modest changes to her
Cabinet, the Australian Financial Review reported without saying
where it got the information. Australia’s opposition MPs have
been told to be ready for an Aug. 14 poll, the newspaper said.
The earliest date for a joint House of Representatives and
Senate ballot is Aug. 7 under Australian election laws.
