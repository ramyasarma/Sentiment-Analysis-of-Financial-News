             Lance Armstrong  says next
month’s Tour de France will be the last for the record
seven-time champion.  
 “It’s been a great ride,” Armstrong wrote on his
Twitter page. “Looking forward to three great weeks.”
Armstrong’s manager, Mark Higgins, confirmed the decision
in an e-mail.  
 Armstrong, 38, finished third in the Tour last year in
his return to cycling’s biggest event after a three-year
retirement. He raced for the Kazakhstan-backed Astana team
behind winner  Alberto Contador . Following a rift with the
Spanish rider, Armstrong started a team sponsored by
 RadioShack Corp. , the second-largest U.S. electronics
chain, for this year’s race.  
 Armstrong won the Tour seven straight times from 1999-
2005 before retiring. He announced his comeback in
September 2008 to raise awareness about cancer. Armstrong
took time away from the sport in 1998 while recovering from
testicular cancer that spread to his brain and lungs.  
 This year’s Tour starts in Rotterdam before moving
through Belgium and into France. The course heads to the
Alps in the second week and in the final week riders will
go over the Pyrenees before the race ends on the Champs
Elysees in Paris.
