             The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index slumped to
its lowest level in 10 months amid concern about debt levels in
Europe and signs that global economic growth may be slowing.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  plunged 157.46, or 3.1
percent, to 4,914.22, its lowest level since Sept. 4, 2009. The
index closed below the 5,000 mark for the first time since May
25. The  FTSE All-Share Index  declined 3 percent and Ireland’s
 ISEQ Index  dropped 3.8 percent.  
 Investor sentiment worsened after the Conference Board
corrected its April gauge for China’s economic outlook to
indicate slower growth and Citigroup Inc. said the country’s
exports face “strong headwinds” in the second half of the year
from policy tightening measures and the European debt crisis.
Confidence among U.S. consumers declined in June more than
forecast as Americans became pessimistic about the outlook for
the labor market and the economy.  
 “Investors in Europe sold heavily out of the riskier
asset classes such as the miners and banks,” wrote  Joshua Raymond , a market strategist at City Index in London, in a note
to clients today. “Debt issues are clearly continuing to weigh
on the market and until investors see austerity measures
succeeding, debt is likely to play a strong hand in market
behaviour for some time.”  
 Declines were led by Rio Tinto Plc, the world’s third-
largest mining company, and peers BHP Billiton Plc, Xstrata Plc
and Lonmin Plc.  
 Rio Tinto Venture  
 Rio Tinto dropped 6.4 percent to 3,048 pence, its biggest
decline since May 19. Rio shareholders may vote down a proposed
iron-ore venture with BHP Billiton because of payment terms,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said.  
 “China’s overheated economy is cooling off, implying the
policy tightening is working, so be ready for lower readings of
Chinese data in the coming weeks,” wrote analysts at HSBC
Holdings Plc, including  Qu Hongbin  and  Sun Junwei , in a research
note today.  
 Barclays Plc lost 6.3 percent to 267.35 pence, its lowest
closing level since February. U.K. banks approved fewer
mortgages than economists forecast in May, a sign the housing-
market recovery is losing steam.  
 In the U.S., the Conference Board’s confidence index
slumped to 52.9 this month from a revised 62.7 in May, according
to figures from the New York-based private research group. The
median forecast called for a drop to 62.5, and the gauge was
lower than all projections in a Bloomberg News survey of 71
economists.  
 The following stocks also rose or fell in the U.K. and
Irish markets. Symbols are in parenthesis.  
 Anglo American Plc  (AAL LN): dropped 5.6 percent to 2,388
pence, its lowest level since Feb. 25. The mining company denied
a report in O Estado de S. Paulo that it had to buy iron ore
from Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA to meet a supply contract with
Gulf Industrial Investment Co., a company spokesman said.  
 BP Plc  (BP/ LN): fell 1.7 percent to 302.9 pence, its
lowest close since August 1996, after members of its employee
savings plan filed a lawsuit against the company over losses
tied to its plunging stock price amid the oil leak disaster in
the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Carpetright Plc  (CPR LN): declined 9.9 percent to 640
pence, its biggest drop since March 23. The U.K.’s largest
carpet retailer said full-year pretax profit gained 34 percent
to 22.3 million pounds ($33.6 million).  
 National Express Group Plc  (NEX LN): fell for a fifth
straight day, losing 3.1 percent to 219.9 pence. The U.K. bus
and rail operator said that trading continued in line with
forecasts through the second quarter of the year and that first-
half normalised pretax profit will probably show “good
progress” over the same period a year earlier.  
 Pursuit Dynamics Plc  (PDX LN): lost 3.8 percent to 233.75
pence, its biggest decline in almost a month. The U.K. developer
of a mist spray used in fire extinguishing systems posted a loss
per share of 5.33 pence for the six months ended March 31,
compared with a loss of 5.54 pence for the same period a year
earlier.  
 Serco Group Plc  (SRP LN): fell 3.3 percent to 603 pence,
its lowest level since May 27. The operator of London’s
Docklands Light Railway said in a trading statement it remains
“on track” to meet earnings guidance for the full year.  
 Xstrata Plc  (XTA LN): lost 6.1 percent to 908.7 pence,
reaching its lowest since May 20. The company’s Philippine unit
said the governor of South Cotabato province approved a ban on
open-pit mining, raising concern over a $5.2 billion copper and
gold joint venture with Indophil Resources Plc.
