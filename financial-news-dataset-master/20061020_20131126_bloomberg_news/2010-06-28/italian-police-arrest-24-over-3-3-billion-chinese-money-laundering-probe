             Italian finance police arrested 24
people in a probe of alleged money laundering of 2.7 billion
euros ($3.3 billion) by a Chinese criminal organization involved
in counterfeiting, tax evasion, human trafficking and
prostitution.  
 The country’s finance police are seizing assets worth
“tens of” millions of euros in eight regions including Tuscany
and Lombardy, according to an e-mailed statement today. Police
arrested 17 Chinese nationals and seven Italians for alleged
mafia association for laundering profits made through
counterfeiting, tax evasion, human trafficking and prostitution
since 2006, according to the statement.  
 The gang was run by a Chinese family based in Milan. They
partnered with Italians who owned a money transfer company in
Bologna, police said. They took part in criminal activities,
mainly counterfeiting in the central Italian provinces of
Florence and Prato, home to one of Italy’s biggest Chinese
communities. Police seized more than 780,000 counterfeit goods
produced in the area or shipped from China.  
 A total of 134 people are under investigation. The ring
exploited illegal Chinese immigrants in textile factories, who
were living in “dirty and unhealthy” conditions, according to
the police statement.  
 Italy’s finance police discovered 22 billion euros in
undeclared income in the first five months of 2010.
