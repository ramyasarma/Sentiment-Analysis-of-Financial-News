             Talaat Moustafa Group Holding ,
Egypt’s largest publicly traded real-estate developer, said it
doesn’t expect to see any “significant” impact from a court
ruling annulling a purchase of land for its Madinaty project.  
 The Cairo-based developer has not received any
cancellations due to the ruling,  Jihad Alsawaftah , chief
financial officer, said in an e-mailed statement. “In general,
cancellations are within the normal range of operations.”  
 Egypt’s state-run New Urban Communities Authority has
appealed the June 22 ruling to annul its sale of the 33 million
square-meter plot of land on the outskirts of Cairo. The housing
ministry has said that the verdict will not prompt a halt in
construction or the cancellation of contracts at the project,  Al
Mal  newspaper reported on June 23.  
 Shares of Talaat Moustafa closed 0.1 percent higher today
in Cairo at 7.56 Egyptian pounds, valuing the company at 15.3
billion pounds ($2.7 billion).  
 The company’s management “strongly believes” that any
decline in the share price and a slowdown in sales at the
project as a result of the ruling “will not have a significant
impact on the financial position of the group,” Alsawaftah
said.  
 Madinaty is Talaat Moustafa’s biggest project. It is
designed to house 600,000 people in 120,000 units, including
villas and apartment buildings, according to the project’s
 website .
