             Brazil’s economy this year may
expand at the fastest pace since 1994, while  inflation  may
accelerate less than previously expected, according to the
median forecast in a central bank  survey  published today.  
 Brazil’s  economy  may expand 7.13 percent, compared with the
7.06 percent pace forecast a week ago, the June 25 survey of
about 100 economists published today on the central bank’s
website showed. Economists forecast 2011 growth of 4.5 percent.  
 Consumer prices will rise 5.55 percent this year, down from
a week-earlier forecast of 5.61 percent, the survey showed.
Economists kept their 2011 inflation forecast at 4.8 percent for
an eleventh straight week. The central bank targets annual
inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage points.  
 Policy makers have raised Brazil’s  benchmark  interest rate
twice this year to 10.25 percent, from a record low 8.75 percent
in March, to prevent Latin America’s biggest economy from
overheating. The economy grew 9 percent in the first quarter of
2010 from the same quarter a year earlier, fueled by domestic
consumption and a rebound in exports.  
 The central bank will raise the benchmark interest rate to
11 percent at its July 20-21 meeting, the survey showed. Policy
makers will lift the Selic to 12 percent by year-end and to
11.75 percent by the end of 2011, the survey showed.  
 The national statistics agency on June 22 reported that
consumer prices in the 12 months through mid-June rose 5.06
percent. Inflation has been above the bank’s target every month
this year.  
 The real rose 0.2 percent to 1.7775 per U.S. dollar at 8:25
a.m. New York time, from 1.7802 on June 25. In the overnight
interest-rate futures market, the yield on the contract due in
January rose one basis point to 11.32 percent.
