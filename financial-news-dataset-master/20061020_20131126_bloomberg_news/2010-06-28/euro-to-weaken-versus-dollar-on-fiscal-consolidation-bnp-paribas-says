             The euro will weaken against the
dollar after the region’s governments took steps to lower their
budget deficits while the U.S. continues with a policy of fiscal
stimulus, said BNP Paribas SA.  
 “The relatively stronger economies will have to accept
higher exchange rates to allow the euro zone to export its way
to recovery and fiscal health,” BNP currency strategists led by
Hans-Guenter Redeker in London wrote in a research report today.
“This means that Asian and commodity currencies will remain
supported, while the euro will likely be used as a funding
currency, suggesting a slow, controlled decline.”  
 Any rise above $1.24 should be seen as an opportunity to
sell the euro, BNP said.  
 The European currency was unchanged at $1.2369 as of 10
a.m. in London.
