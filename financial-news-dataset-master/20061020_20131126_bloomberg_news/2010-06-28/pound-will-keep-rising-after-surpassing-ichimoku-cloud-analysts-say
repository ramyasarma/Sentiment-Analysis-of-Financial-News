             The pound may advance to $1.56
against the dollar after surpassing key “cloud resistance” on
the daily ichimoku chart, according to Technical Alpha, a New-
York based research company.  
 Sterling rallied above the upper and lower lines on the
chart for the first time in six months on June 23,  James Stellakis , the company’s founder, wrote in an e-mailed report.  
 “Short-term risk is to the upside after key resistance was
cleared,” Stellakis wrote.  
 The pound traded at $1.5062 as of 11:35 a.m. in London. It
climbed to $1.5078 on June 25, its highest level since May 6.
An ichimoku chart analyzes the midpoints of historic highs and
lows. A cloud is the area between the first and second leading
span lines on the chart, and is used to show an area where buy
or sell orders may be clustered.  
 “Upside targets come in between $1.53, the long-term
downtrend resistance, and $1.56, the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the August 2009-May 2010 decline,” Stellakis
said in a telephone interview today. The cloud area on the
chart, which acts as support when prices are above it, “should
provide a floor to the pound between $1.4878 and $1.4580 through
July,” Stellakis said.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support is where buy orders may be
grouped, and resistance is a level where sell orders may be
clustered.
