             Brazilian arabica coffee exports may
be reduced after rain damaged flowering of the beans last year,
the world’s largest coffee cooperative said.  
 At least 20 percent of the current crop doesn’t meet
minimum quality standards for export, compared with an average
of 15 percent in recent years, said Joaquim Goulart, chief
agronomist of the  Cooxupe  cooperative. Brazil is the world’s
largest producer of coffee.  
 “The more the harvest advances, the more we are
disappointed with quality,” Goulart said today in a telephone
interview from Guaxupe, in Brazil’s Minas Gerais state. The
cooperative’s growers have harvested about 28 percent of their
total crop this year, he said.  
 Cooxupe’s 11,500 growers, which account for 13 percent of
Brazil’s arabica coffee production, will harvest 5 million bags
this year. The arabica coffee harvest in Brazil runs from March
to September.
