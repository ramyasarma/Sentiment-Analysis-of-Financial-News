             Gains by the U.K. pound may be
limited as investors bet the government’s budget cuts will
hinder the economic recovery, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  
 “At some stage the impact of fiscal tightening on growth
will become visible and at that stage, weaker demand could
translate into weaker sterling again,” analysts including
 Thomas Stolper  in London wrote in an e-mailed report received
today. “But just how much is tough to say.”  
 The pound was little changed at $1.5060 as of 1:38 p.m. in
London, leaving it 1.6 percent stronger since last month’s
election. It was 0.4 percent stronger at 81.82 pence per euro.
