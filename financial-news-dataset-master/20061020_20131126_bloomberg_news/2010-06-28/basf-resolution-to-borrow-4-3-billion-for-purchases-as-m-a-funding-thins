             BASF SE, the world’s largest
chemicals company, and buyout firm Resolution Ltd. are raising
$4.3 billion to fund European takeovers as banks scale back
lending to a decade-low and back deals less likely to default.  
 BASF arranged 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) of financing
June 23 to buy German food- and cosmetics-ingredients maker
Cognis Holding GmbH. Resolution Ltd. plans to borrow 400 million
pounds ($602 million) to buy U.K. interests from Axa SA.  
 Loans to fund acquisitions in Europe fell to $10.8 billion
in the second quarter, the lowest since the first quarter of
1999, as private-equity led deals dwindle. Banks have become
choosier when lending to finance takeovers, as speculation that
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis may trigger a so-called double-
dip recession prompts them to avoid speculative-grade companies
more likely to default.  
 “Banks want to focus on high-grade M&A,” said credit
analyst  Sven Kreitmair  at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “Very good,
single-A rated companies are getting much better access to
funding. Such companies are better suited to withstand a double-
dip recession and still keep their investment-grade ratings.”  
 Financing for buyout firms in Europe fell 94 percent in the
second quarter from the first three months of the year, compared
with a 45 percent increase in loans to investment-grade
companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. M&A
financing in Europe hit a quarterly low of $4.3 billion during
the first three months of 1999, the data show.  
 Refinancing Threat  
 BASF is ranked A by S&P, the sixth of 10 investment-grade
ratings, and a step higher at A1 by Moody Investors Service. S&P
cut its assessment June 23 from A+ as a result of the
Ludwigshafen, Germany-based company’s borrowings to pay for
Cognis. Moody’s placed its rating under review for downgrade the
same day. Resolution, based in Guernsey, is unrated.  
 Issuers of leveraged loans will struggle to refinance 37
billion euros of debt due in 2014 and 49 billion euros in 2015,
Standard & Poor’s said in a June 15 report. Those that need to
refinance are “likely” to seek debt restructurings in the
absence of a “strong economic recovery,” S&P said.  
 Two companies with loans outstanding sought Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in May while no companies have defaulted
on their bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said in a
note to clients June 22. The companies, Long Beach, New York-
based Chem Rx Corp. and Miami-based Neff Corp., have a combined
$940 million of loans outstanding, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Buyout firms raise high-yield, or leveraged, loans to pay
for acquisitions, loading the debt onto the target’s balance
sheet. The borrowings are either unrated, or given junk ratings
below Baa3 from Moody’s or BBB- from S&P.
