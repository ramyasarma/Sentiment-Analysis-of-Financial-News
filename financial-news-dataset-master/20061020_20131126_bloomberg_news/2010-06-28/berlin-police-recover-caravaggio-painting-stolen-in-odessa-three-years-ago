             German federal police said they
recovered a painting attributed to Caravaggio and stolen in
Odessa, Ukraine, two years ago during an attempt to sell the
artwork in Berlin.  
 Three Ukrainians and a Russian national were arrested on
June 25 when they sought to complete the transaction in Berlin,
and another 20 people were arrested in Ukraine in connection
with the theft, German police said today in a statement. The
painting, The Taking of Christ, also known as Judas’ Kiss, was
stolen in July 2008.
