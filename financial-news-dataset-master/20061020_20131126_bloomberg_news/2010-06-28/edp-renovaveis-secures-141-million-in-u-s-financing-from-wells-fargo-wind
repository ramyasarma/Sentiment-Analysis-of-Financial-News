             EDP Renovaveis SA, the renewable-
energy unit of Portugal’s biggest utility, secured $141 million
in equity financing from Wells Fargo Wind Holdings LLC in
exchange for an interest in several U.S. wind-energy stations.  
 With the investment, the arm of Lisbon-based  EDP-Energias
de Portugal SA  has now raised $517 million through the group of
wind farms known as Vento III, completing its funding needs,
according to a statement today from EDP Renovaveis.  
 In May, EDP said it will reduce annual investments starting
next year as it slows wind-energy developments in the U.S. and
pays lower prices for wind turbines. The company said it will
trim investments to 2.40 billion euros ($3 billion) a year in
2011 and 2012 from 3 billion euros this year. Investments in
domestic hydropower will increase as its projects move forward.  
 EDP Renovaveis said in May that it planned to add 1.2
gigawatts in capacity a year through 2012, down from 1.4
gigawatts on average from 2007 to 2009.
