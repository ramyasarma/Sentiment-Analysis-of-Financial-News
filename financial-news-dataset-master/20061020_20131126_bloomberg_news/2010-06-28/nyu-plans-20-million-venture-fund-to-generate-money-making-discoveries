             New York University created a
venture-capital pool to encourage discoveries by faculty and
students that can turn into profit-making undertakings.  
 Outlays by the fund will range from $100,000 to $1 million
each, beginning next year, and will go to start-up companies
commercializing NYU research, the university said today in a
statement. The fund expects to start producing income for the
university in five to seven years, said  Frank Rimalovski , the
fund’s managing director.  
 NYU  received $2 million toward the pool from the sale of an
information-technology venture earlier this year, and will seek
$18 million from donors, said Rimalovski, who assumed his post
in May.  
 “We’re looking to build an investor syndicate to support
the growth of companies -- Internet, life sciences and
information technology, for example -- that we spin out of
NYU,” Rimalovski said in an interview.  
 Rimalovski was a partner at  New Venture Partners , a
venture-capital company with more than $700 million under
management, according to NYU’s statement. New Venture Partners
is based Murray Hill, New Jersey.  
 NYU won’t publicly identify the information-technology
business it sold or say who the buyer was, Rimalovski said. The
university had an interest in that company because it was based
on research performed at NYU, he said.  
 The university operates research laboratories and a
hospital complex in addition to its undergraduate, graduate and
professional schools. More than 43,400 students attend NYU,
founded in 1831. The university is based in New York City’s
Greenwich Village neighborhood and had an endowment of $2.2
billion as of Aug. 31.
