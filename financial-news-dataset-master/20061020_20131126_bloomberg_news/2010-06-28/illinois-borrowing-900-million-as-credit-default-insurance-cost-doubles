             Illinois  plans to add $900 million
in Build America Bonds to the $755 million in securities it sold
in June as the cost of insuring the state’s debt against default
reached a record high.  
 The cost of an Illinois credit-default swap has more than
doubled since April 5 to a record of 370 basis points, or
$370,000 to protect $10 million of debt, according to CMA
DataVision. The state rescheduled the Build America sale for
mid-July, after originally planning it for as early as this
week, Dow Jones reported, citing  John Sinsheimer , Illinois’s
capital markets director.  
 The state paid a  premium  of 80 basis points on 10-year
general obligation debt over top-rated tax-exempts, or 5 basis
points more than at the start of the month. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  
 Some of the spread can be attributed to the state’s sale of
$2 billion in debt in three months, said  Mike Pietronico , who
oversees $275 million in municipal holdings as chief executive
officer of New York-based Miller Tabak Asset Management.  
 “There’s some saturation of the name and that’s costing
them in terms of pricing,” Pietronico said. “Once they move
past this borrowing binge, the bonds will begin to perform
better.”  
 Illinois’s debt is rated fifth-highest by Moody’s Investors
Service, at A1, and by Standard & Poor’s, at A+. The state’s
obligations are the most expensive municipal debt to insure, at
19 basis points above California, the largest U.S. state
borrower.  
 Yield Spread  
 The  yield spread  between the average Build America Bond and
the 30-year U.S. Treasury widened about 32 basis points this
month to about 192 basis points, according to Bloomberg data.  
 “Look for some stabilization” in the pricing, according
to Pietronico, who said the state’s spreads have widened so much
that the deal will bring in “value buyers.”  
 “It’s still a state GO and the appealing yields will bring
in demand,” he said, referring to the general-obligation debt.  
 Illinois lawmakers went home May 27 without resolving the
state’s $13 billion deficit in the budget for the fiscal year
that begins this week. The $900 million sale would bring the
state’s outstanding general obligation debt to $26.9 billion,
according to Fitch Ratings.  
 Proceeds of the offering will fund transportation projects,
preliminary documents show.  
 Rating Cut  
 The state’s fiscal troubles led to a one-level rating cut
last week of the Illinois Regional Transportation Authority, the
second-largest public transportation system in the U.S., by both
Fitch and Moody’s.  
 Illinois sold $300 million of Build America Bonds on June
17 in a competitive offering won by Citigroup Inc. The
securities mature serially from 2011 through 2021 and in 2025
and 2035. Five-year debt priced to yield 4.5 percent, 250 basis
points more than a similar maturity government security. The
notes traded June 25 at an average yield of 4.52 percent, a
spread of 260 basis points, according to Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board data.  
 Debt from the sale maturing in 2035 yielded 7.1 percent,
297 basis points over a 30-year Treasury. On June 25 the
security traded at an average yield of 6.99 percent, 293 basis
points higher.  
 Peoria, Illinois-based  Caterpillar Inc. , which is rated on
par with Illinois by Fitch and one level below by Moody’s and
S&P, offered yields of 5.35 percent on June 24 for debt maturing
in 2038. The world’s largest maker of construction equipment
paid 145 basis points below Illinois’s higher-rated and shorter-
term notes.  
 Sinsheimer and  Kelly Kraft , a spokeswoman for Governor  Pat Quinn , didn’t return calls or e-mails seeking comment on the Dow
Jones report. The state delayed the sale until the governor
decides on signing off on the budget for the year starting July
1, the report said.
