             Inflation in six German states
slowed in June as lower prices for items such as gas and package
holidays more than compensated for higher oil costs.  
 The  inflation  rate fell to 0.9 percent from 1.2 percent in
Bavaria, to 1 percent from 1.4 percent in Baden-Wuerttemberg and
to 0.5 percent from 0.8 percent in Hesse, the states’ statistics
offices said today. North Rhine-Westphalia, Brandenburg and
Saxony also reported slower inflation.  Economists forecast
German inflation, calculated using a harmonized European Union
method and based on data from the six states, will decelerate to
1 percent from 1.2 percent. That report is due from the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden later today.  
 Crude oil prices have increased almost 9 percent over the
past year, nudging inflation just as a weaker euro pushes up the
cost of imported goods. Still, with consumers holding back
spending and a European debt crisis clouding the growth outlook,
companies may struggle to raise prices.  
 “There’s no price pressure in sight,” said  Jens Kramer ,
an economist at NordLB in Hanover. “We won’t see inflation
accelerating towards 2 percent this year or next.”  
 The European Central Bank aims to keep inflation just below
2 percent. It has kept its  benchmark interest rate  at a record
low of 1 percent since May 2009. At the same time, the ECB is
buying government bonds and lending banks as much money as they
need to contain the effects of the debt crisis, which has driven
the euro down 14 percent against the dollar this year.  
 German import prices increased 8.5 percent in May from a
year earlier, the biggest annual gain in almost 10 years.  
 In the state of Bavaria, food prices decreased 0.2 percent
from May, today’s report showed. Package holidays were 1.5
percent cheaper than a year ago while prices for heating oil
increased 23.5 percent.
