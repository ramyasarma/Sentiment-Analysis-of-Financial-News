             Rubber advanced to a one-month high
after data showed stockpiles in China declined to the lowest
level in seven years, sparking optimism the biggest buyer may
soon replenish inventories.  
 Futures in Tokyo climbed to 288.6 yen per kilogram ($3,231
a metric ton), matching a high reached on May 28. The price
gained 3.8 percent last week, booking the second weekly increase,
as rainfall disrupted production in Thailand, the world’s
biggest producer and exporter.  
 Natural rubber  stockpiles  monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 1,670 tons to 14,771 tons, the bourse said on
June 25. It was the lowest level since January 2003, according
to the Bloomberg data.  
 “Chinese buyers may have withheld rubber purchases amid
speculation that the raw material prices would drop on a
seasonal increase in production,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at
commodity broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said today by phone.
“As rubber prices have stayed high,” they may step up buying
to replenish inventories, he said.  
 Rubber for December delivery settled at 283.80 yen from its
settlement of 278.6 yen on June 25. It has become the most-
actively traded contract on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange after
its listing on June 25.  
 November-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
added 1.7 percent to settle at 22,265 yuan ($3,278) a ton.
Earlier, it rose to 22,420 yuan, the highest level since June 2.  
 China Demand  
 China, the largest auto market, is the biggest consumer of
natural rubber. The nation may increase gross imports of the raw
material to 1.68 million tons this year, from 1.59 million in
2009, according to a May report from the Association of Natural
Rubber Producing Countries.  
 In Thailand, “heavy rains in southern provinces have
reduced tapping, supporting prices,” said  Chaiwat Muenmee , an
analyst at Bangkok-based commodity broker DS Futures Co.  
 The auctioned price of ribbed smoked sheet gained 0.6
percent to 111.91 baht ($3.46) a kilogram as supply is limited,
the  Rubber Institute of Thailand  said on its website today.  
 The benchmark price in Thailand remained unchanged at
118.85 baht ($3.67) a kilogram, according to the institute. A
decline in rainfalls in southern Thailand will increase the
latex volume, it said.  
 Rubber prices may climb 26 percent next year as supplies
lag behind demand, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Asia
Securities (Singapore) Pte.  
 Rubber may average $4,500 a ton next year, up from $3,580 a
ton year-to-date, as “heavy rainfall in southern Thailand has
disrupted supply” and “inventory levels in China are worse
than we expected,” Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, a commodities analyst
at the bank, said in an e-mailed report last week.
