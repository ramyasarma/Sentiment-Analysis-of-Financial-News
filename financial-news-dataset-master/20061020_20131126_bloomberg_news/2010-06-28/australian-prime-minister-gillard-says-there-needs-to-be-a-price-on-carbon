             Australian Prime Minister Julia
Gillard said there needs to be a price on carbon. Gillard, who
became prime minister last week after challenging Kevin Rudd,
said there was still a lot of work to do on carbon pricing. Rudd
delayed a proposed carbon trading plan amid opposition from
lawmakers earlier this year. The shelving of the carbon
pollution reduction scheme, intended to cut emissions by at
least 5 percent, came almost four months after some 190 nations
failed to agree on a binding greenhouse gas treaty at talks in
Copenhagen.
