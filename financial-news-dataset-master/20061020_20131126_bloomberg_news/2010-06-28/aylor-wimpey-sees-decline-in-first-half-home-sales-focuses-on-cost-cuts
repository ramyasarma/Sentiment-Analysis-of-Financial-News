             Taylor Wimpey Plc , Britain’s second-
largest homebuilder by volume, said first-half home sales in the
U.K. will probably decline to 4,650 from 4,702 a year earlier.  
 Average prices are likely to rise to about 167,000 pounds
($251,000), from 153,000 pounds, Taylor Wimpey said today in a
statement. The order book accounts for 83 percent of the
company’s full-year sales target, it said.  
 “With ongoing political and economic uncertainty, we
continue to run the business on a cautious basis, with selective
land investment and an ongoing focus on costs and cash,” the
company said in the statement. “We remain concerned regarding
future spending reviews that could impact on housing
initiatives.”  
 U.K. house prices rose the least in five months in June as
the prospect of a budget squeeze curbed demand and the supply of
homes for sale increased, Hometrack Ltd. said today. The number
of new buyers registering with real-estate agents grew 0.1
percent, and fell in six out of 10 regions, led by a 0.9 percent
drop in London, the report said.  
 Taylor Wimpey’s net debt fell to 650 million pounds from
751 million pounds at the end of December, the company said.
Sales rates in North America, which accounts for about 30
percent of the company’s revenue, have been “stable” this
year, and the company expects to sell 1,800 in the first-half,
down from 1,933, it said.
