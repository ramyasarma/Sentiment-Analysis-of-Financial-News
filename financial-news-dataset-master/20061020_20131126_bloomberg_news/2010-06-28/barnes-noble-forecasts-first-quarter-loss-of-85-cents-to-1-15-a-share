             (Corrects in second paragraph to say first-quarter analyst
estimate is not comparable.)  
 Barnes & Noble Inc. had a fourth-
quarter adjusted loss of 89 cents a share. The average estimate
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a loss of 81 cents a
share.  
 The bookseller forecast a first-quarter loss of 85 cents to
$1.15 a share. The average analyst estimate for a loss of 44
cents is not comparable.
