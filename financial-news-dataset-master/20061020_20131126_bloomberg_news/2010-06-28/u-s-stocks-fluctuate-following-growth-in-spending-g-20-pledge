             U.S. stocks gained, led by cigarette
and telephone companies, after the Supreme Court rejected the
Justice Department’s bid for as much as $280 billion in tobacco
profits and Sprint Nextel Corp. turned on fourth-generation
service in more markets.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.4 percent to
1,080.7 at 11:10 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average climbed 45.34 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,189.15.  
 U.S. benchmark indexes drifted between gains and losses
earlier following a bigger-than-forecast rise in consumer
spending and a pledge by Group of 20 leaders to cut deficits
while still maintaining economic stimulus efforts.  
 The S&P 500 is poised for about a 7.6 percent second-
quarter retreat, snapping a four-quarter streak of gains. The
index rallied 9.2 percent from the end of 2009 through this
year’s high on April 23 amid signs of improvement in the global
economy. The gauge then tumbled 14 percent through June 7 on
concern Europe’s debt crisis may derail the economic recovery.  
 The measure remains about 3 percent lower in 2010, trimming
its valuation to about 16 times the reported earnings of its
companies, near the lowest level in almost a year.  
 G-20 leaders responded to the European debt crisis with
deficit-reduction targets and agreed to pursue higher capital
requirements for banks once economic recoveries take hold.
Advanced G-20 economies will aim to halve deficits by 2013 and
start to stabilize their debt-to-output ratios by 2016, the
group said in a statement yesterday after a meeting in Toronto.
Leaders said nations can move at their own pace and also pledged
to fulfill existing stimulus plans.  
 Obama on Growth, China  
 President Barack Obama welcomed the deficit-cutting goal
set by the G-20 nations even as he warned against acting too
quickly to pull back stimulus measures. Obama also said at the
conclusion of summit yesterday that the U.S. will be watching
closely as China relaxes its currency policy.  
 UBS AG’s average estimate for earnings in 2011 for
companies on the S&P 500 would fall 7.2 percent to $90 were the
European economy to slip back into recession, strategist
Jonathan Golub wrote in a report today. The average estimate for
earnings-per-share for S&P 500 companies in 2011 is $88.60,
according to a survey of 10 strategists from June 21.  
 Stock prices are mirroring government bond yields more than
ever, a signal to bulls that shares may be poised to rally. The
S&P 500 and 10-year Treasury rates posted a correlation
coefficient of 0.8412 in the 60 trading days through June 16,
showing stock prices and bond yields were the most linked in
Bloomberg data going back to 1962. The last time the
relationship was almost this strong during an economic expansion
was at the beginning of the 2002 to 2007 bull market, when the
benchmark gauge for U.S. equities doubled.
