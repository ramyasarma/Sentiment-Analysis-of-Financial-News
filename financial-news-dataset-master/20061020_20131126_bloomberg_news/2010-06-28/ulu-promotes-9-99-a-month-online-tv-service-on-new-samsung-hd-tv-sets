             Hulu LLC , the television website
controlled by three U.S. broadcast networks, began promoting its
yet-to-be-announced paid online service on Samsung TVs.  
 A Samsung 6500 series LED television, purchased June 25 at
a  Best Buy Co.  store in New York, invited buyers to subscribe to
a high-definition Hulu Plus service for $9.99 a month.  
 “More episodes, more seasons, more shows,” the on-screen
offer stated. The service couldn’t be accessed immediately and a
software update on June 26 removed the offer.  
 Christina Lee , a spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Hulu,
declined to comment. Customers were asked to submit an e-mail
address and enter a referral code at a Web link that wasn’t
active. A trial offer included 21 video clips.  
 Owned by  Walt Disney Co. ’s ABC,  General Electric Co. ’s NBC
and  News Corp. ’s Fox network, Hulu is working with consumer-
electronics companies to gain a bigger audience by making its
Web-based programming more widely available on TVs.  
 Sony Corp.  is close to an agreement to offer Hulu’s paid
service on its PlayStation 3 game console, two people with
knowledge of the talks said last week. Hulu also is in talks
with CBS Corp., Viacom Inc. and Time Warner Inc. to add their TV
shows to the website’s subscription service, people with direct
knowledge of the discussions said.  
 The site, which now lets computer users watch shows for
free and gets its revenue from advertising, is seeking to expand
the ways viewers access its programming, as well as add new
shows to attract paying subscribers.  
 Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 26 cents to
$33.22 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .
GE, based in Fairfield, Connecticut, rose 9 cents to $15. New
York-based  News Corp.  gained 10 cents to $12.67 in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading.  
 Private-equity firm Providence Equity Partners Inc. is also
an investor in the website.
