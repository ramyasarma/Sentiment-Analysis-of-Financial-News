             Takashimaya Co., a Japanese
department-store operator, said it plans to terminate its U.S.
operations to relocate resources to faster-growing markets in
Asia.  
 The company will sell a property on New York’s Fifth Avenue
to a unit of Thor Equities LLC for $142 million and book a one-
time gain of 11 billion yen this fiscal year from the sale,
according to a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.
