             The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 3 basis
points to 545.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 2 p.m. in
London. The index, which is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and a decline indicates
improvements in the perception of credit quality, has risen from
428 basis points at the end of the last quarter.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings dropped 1.75 basis points to 124.5,
JPMorgan prices show. The cost of protecting financial company
bonds from default also fell, with the Markit iTraxx Financial
Index tied to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers down 3 at
163 and the subordinated index 1 lower at 250.  
 The  Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index  of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell 3 basis points to 156,
according to CMA DataVision.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
