             Wattyl Ltd.  shares surged to a two-
year  high  after the Australian paintmaker agreed to a A$142
million ($124 million) takeover offer from coating-manufacturer
 Valspar Corp.   
 Valspar will pay A$1.67 for each Wattyl share, a 113
percent premium to its closing price on May 24 when it received
an initial takeover proposal and 33 percent more than its
closing price on June 25, Sydney-based Wattyl said in a
statement to the Australian stock exchange.  
 The company’s board has unanimously recommended that
shareholders vote in favor of the acquisition by Minneapolis-
based Valspar, Wattyl said in the statement. Investors will be
sent the details of the offer in August, the company said.  
 Wattyl  shares  soared 28 percent to close at A$1.615 in
Sydney, the highest since August 2008. Valspar  rose  0.5 percent
to close at $31.08 in New York on Friday.  
 “With global expertise and scale, Valspar will provide
Wattyl’s customers and employees with significant benefits,”
Wattyl Chairman  John Ingram  said in the statement. “Valspar is
well positioned to support Wattyl for the next phase of its
growth.”  
 The acquisition offers an “outstanding opportunity” to
grow in the Asia-Pacific region, New York Stock Exchange-listed
Valspar Chief Executive Officer  William Mansfield  said in an e-
mailed release.
