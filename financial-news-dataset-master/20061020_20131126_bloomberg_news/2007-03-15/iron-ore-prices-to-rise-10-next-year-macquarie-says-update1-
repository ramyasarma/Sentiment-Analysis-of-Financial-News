             Iron ore  contract prices may rise
10 percent next year on expectation of rising demand from China,
according to Macquarie Bank Ltd., the largest investment bank in
 Australia , the biggest iron ore exporter.  
 The bank had previously forecast a 15 percent drop in the
price of the steelmaking material in 2008, Macquarie said in a
note to clients dated today. Citigroup Inc. also raised its
forecast this month to a 7 percent increase, reversing an
earlier estimate of a 20 percent fall.  
 Iron ore has risen for five straight years to a record this
year on increased demand from China, which supplies one-third of
the world's steel. The increases have driven profits to all time
highs at  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  and Cia. Vale do Rio
Doce, the mining companies that account for three-quarters of
global trade in iron ore.  
 ``The pace of Chinese industrial production is expected to
increase as infrastructure spend accelerates, in part due to
surplus liquidity,'' the Macquarie's note said.  
 Chinese steelmakers may import 4.3 percent more of the
steelmaking ingredient in 2007 and 7.4 percent in 2008,
Citigroup's analyst  Alan Heap  said in a March 6 report.  
 China's steel output rose 23 percent to 74.3 million tons
in the first two months this year from a year ago, the National
Bureau of Statistics said today through its agency.
