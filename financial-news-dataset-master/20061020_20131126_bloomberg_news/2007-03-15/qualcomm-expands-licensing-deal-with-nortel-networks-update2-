             Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , a U.S. chipmaker
facing lawsuits because of its royalty rates, expanded a
licensing agreement with  Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ) , North America's
largest maker of telephone gear.  
 Nortel gains the right to use some of its partner's patents
to make network products, Qualcomm said today in a statement. In
turn, San Diego-based Qualcomm has permission to make and sell
components for certain phones using Nortel's patents.  
 Qualcomm, which faces suits in the U.S. and Europe, also is
under investigation by regulators in the European Union amid
allegations the company overcharges Nokia Oyj and others on
royalties. The company is negotiating with Nokia, the world's
largest maker of handsets, to extend a royalty agreement that
ends April 9.  
 Shares of Qualcomm rose 49 cents to $43.70 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite  trading . They've
gained 16 percent this year. Shares of Toronto-based Nortel
climbed 19 cents to $27.22 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.  
 Qualcomm didn't disclose the terms of the deal.
