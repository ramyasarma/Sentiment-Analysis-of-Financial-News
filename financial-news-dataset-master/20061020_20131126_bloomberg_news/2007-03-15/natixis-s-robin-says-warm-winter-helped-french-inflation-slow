             Jean-Francois Robin, an economist
with Natixis in Paris, commented on French February inflation.
He spoke in a televised interview yesterday.  
 Consumer prices rose less than expected last month, cutting
the annual inflation rate to 1.2 percent as  oil prices  declined.  
 The figures ``were a good surprise. Food prices fell 0.4
percent on the month, that's due to very warm weather in
February. We've had the warmest winter since 1950. Also there's
a basis effect compared with 2006.''
