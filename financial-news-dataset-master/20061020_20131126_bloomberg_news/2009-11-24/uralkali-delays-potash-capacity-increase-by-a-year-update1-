             OAO Uralkali (URKA) ,  Russia ’s second-
biggest potash producer, delayed an increase in capacity for
making the soil nutrient by a year as demand takes time to
rebound.  
 Capacity will only climb to 7 million metric tons from 5.5
million tons in 2012, the Berezniki, Russia-based company said
in a statement today.  
 “While we remain fully confident about the future
prospects of the global potash market, our current focus is on
reducing costs rather than increasing production capacity,”
spokesman Alan Basiev said in a separate statement.  
 Farmers delayed buying fertilizer and sought discounts
after the world recession pushed crop prices lower and spurred
expectations that the soil nutrient’s cost would fall further.
Potash producers worldwide cut output by about 48 percent in the
first half as demand slumped. They also cut prices for  India ,
viewed as a benchmark, by 26 percent to $460 a ton in July.  
 “Although the industry’s fundamentals remain very strong,
it will take some time for demand to recover to the pre-crisis
level,” Uralkali said. Usage “might” be strong enough by 2012
to absorb the increased supply, it said.  
 Potash is a mineral used to shield crops from dryness.
