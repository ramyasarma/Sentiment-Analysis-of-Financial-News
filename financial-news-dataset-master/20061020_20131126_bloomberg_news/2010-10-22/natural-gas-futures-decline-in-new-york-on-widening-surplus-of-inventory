Natural gas futures fell to a 13-
month low in New York, capping a fifth straight weekly decline,
as mild weather crimped demand, boosting a surplus of the
heating fuel.  Gas declined after the Energy Department reported yesterday
that 93 billion cubic feet of gas were added to U.S. storage in
the week ended Oct. 15. The five-year average gain for the week
is 54 billion. Above-normal temperatures are likely across most
of the eastern U.S. through Oct. 31, according to MDA Federal
Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in Rockville, Maryland.  “We have no significant weather, so the market’s drifting
lower on your typical shoulder-month situation,” said  Tom Saal ,
a broker with Hencorp Becstone Futures in Miami. “Some of the
forecasts for the winter are showing above-normal
temperatures.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 3.6 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.332 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement price since
Sept. 15, 2009. Gas fell 5.7 percent this week and has declined
40 percent this year.  “Weather forecasts continue to provide little support for
prices, with above- to much-above-normal temperatures now
expected for the eastern half of the country in the next couple
of weeks,”  Gene McGillian , an analyst with Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut, said in a note to clients.  The Northeast, Midwest and parts of the West may have
warmer-than-normal weather from Nov. 1 through Nov. 5, MDA said.
The high temperature in New York on Oct. 27 may be 75 degrees
Fahrenheit (24 Celsius), 15 degrees above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania.  Record Supplies  “Normally, toward the end of October gas prices tend to
decline, and it looks like the market is fitting that pattern,”
said  Veronique Lashinski , a senior research analyst for Newedge
USA LLC in Chicago. “We’re going into the winter and the market
has been taking the winter premium out, which suggests traders
are not seeing a whole lot of risk for supplies.”  Stockpiles climbed to a record 3.837 trillion cubic feet
last November before colder weather spurred demand and began to
reduce supplies.  The Energy Department forecast on Oct. 13 that inventories
will peak at 3.726 trillion cubic feet by the end of this month,
the second-highest level ever for the start of a heating season.  Rig Count  The number of U.S. gas drilling rigs totaled 965 in the
week ended Oct. 22, 33 percent higher than a year earlier, data
 released today  by Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. showed.  Gas output will average 61.29 billion cubic feet a day this
year, the most since 1973, according to Energy Department
estimates.  Tropical Storm Richard was likely to reach Honduras late
tomorrow, the  National Hurricane Center  said in an advisory at
about 2 p.m. New York time. Maximum sustained winds were near 40
miles (64 kilometers) per hour, and the storm could become a
hurricane over the weekend, the center said.  Most storms have  bypassed  energy production regions of the
Gulf of Mexico this year. The Atlantic hurricane season ends on
Nov. 30.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, fell 27.48 cents, or 7.9 percent, to $3.1856 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
178,314 as of 2:44 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
268,000. Volume was 307,851 yesterday. Open interest was 818,298
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 807,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
