Australia’s Victoria state has
approved planning permits for a A$326 million wind farm at
Ararat, Planning Minister Justin Madden said in a statement
today.  The wind farm will include 75 wind generators and produce
247.5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power more than
135,000 homes, he said.  The project developers, Renewable Energy Australia Pty,
will have to meet conditions related to visual impact, fauna and
native vegetation, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
