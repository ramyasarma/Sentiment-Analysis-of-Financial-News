Cotton futures in China, the
biggest consumer of the textile, climbed to a record today on
concern that falling domestic and international output will
exacerbate a supply shortage.  Futures gained as much as 0.8 percent to 25,200 yuan a
metric ton and was little changed at 25,020 yuan at the 11:30
a.m. local time break on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange.
Cotton for December delivery in New York rose for a third day,
gaining 1.1 percent to $1.17 a pound.  “China’s cotton futures keep setting new records amid
concerns about a shortage,” Dong Shuzhi, an analyst at Jinshi
Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai today.  China will produce 550,000 metric tons less cotton than
previously forecast in the year ending in July, Cotlook Ltd.
said in a report. Output will fall to 6.4 million tons from
6.95 million tons a year earlier, the Birkenhead, England-based
researcher said. World production will be 96,000 tons less than
previously expected at 25.06 million tons, Cotlook said.  On Oct 15, futures in New York reached $1.198, the highest
level since the fiber starting trading 140 years ago.  “Chinese output this year might be lower than the
market’s previous expectation because of the recent low
temperatures in main producing areas in the northern China,”
Dong said. “Also, the government has sold out all the
stockpiles by Oct. 20, so there’ll be no more government
supply.”  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
