ALL America Latina Logistica SA ,
Latin America’s largest railroad company, slumped for a fourth
day in Sao Paulo trading amid concern its valuation is too high
given earnings growth potential.  The voting stock fell 4.7 percent to 15.92 reais at 3:47
p.m. New York time, with volume nearly 3,000 times the three-
month average, after the more-traded preferred shares were
converted into voting shares as of today.  ALL has lost 14 percent since Oct. 19 when it reported
third-quarter transported volume that failed to meet an estimate
by Bank of America Corp. The company trades at 40 times reported
earnings, compared to 15 times for the benchmark  Bovespa  index,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The current valuation is not that attractive,” wrote
 Daniela Bretthauer , an analyst at Raymond James & Associates
Inc. in Sao Paulo, in a note to clients today. “ALL’s strategy
has attractive long-term growth opportunities, but low
visibility, and timing for new projects effectively leaves them
on the sidelines.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
