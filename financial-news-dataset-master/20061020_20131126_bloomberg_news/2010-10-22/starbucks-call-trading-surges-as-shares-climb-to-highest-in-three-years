Trading of bullish options on
Starbucks Corp. surged and the stock climbed to a three-year
high as investors bet shares will rise after fourth-quarter
earnings in November.  More than 41,000  calls  to buy shares of the world’s largest
coffee-shop chain changed hands today, the most since April and
four times the number of puts to sell. Call options give the
buyer the right to buy shares at a specific price within a given
time in exchange for a premium.  "Someone is quietly trying to gain huge upside or
volatility exposure,"  Matthew Moran , a New-York based options
trader at SG Americas Securities LLC, said in a telephone
interview. “The unusual option volume of the last few weeks,
combined with today’s huge November option volume, could signal
a large event that is not yet priced into the market."  More than a third of the call volume was  concentrated  in
the November $28 contracts, which rose 127 percent to $1.25.
Starbucks shares jumped 4.4 percent to $28.49 at 4 p.m. in New
York, the highest price since June 2007.  The company will report earnings on Nov. 4. Chief Executive
Officer Howard Schultz predicted last month a ‘‘tough’’ 2011 for
the coffee-house chain, with conditions improving the following
year. Next month’s options expire on Nov. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
