(Corrects to say that Asian shares increased.)  European stocks were little changed
as Valeo SA soared and Volvo AB retreated. U.S. futures were
little changed and Asian shares increased.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed,
losing 0.1 percent to 267.25 at 8:07 a.m. in London, as 13 out
of 19 industry groups declined.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December added 0.2 percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
gained 0.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
