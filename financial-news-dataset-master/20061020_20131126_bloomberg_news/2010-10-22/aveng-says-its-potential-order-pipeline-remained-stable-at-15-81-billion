Aveng Ltd. , South Africa’s largest
construction company by market value, said its “potential order
pipeline remains stable” at 110 billion rand ($15.8 billion)
even after its two-year order book declined.  South Africa “continues to be impacted by delays in
contract awards, particularly in the public sector,” the
Johannesburg-based  company  said in a statement today.
Partnerships with the government could help to “fast-track
infrastructure development,” it said.  The two-year order book declined 6 percent from June to
29.3 billion rand at Sept. 30. A stronger rand to the dollar
will erode earnings from outside of South Africa for Moolmans,
Aveng’s contract mining unit, the company said. Tender delays
“have constrained volumes in the manufacturing and processing
cluster, with margins under pressure” because of lower steel
prices and increasing competition, it said.  Grinaker-LTA, Aveng’s construction unit, was awarded a 211
million-rand contract in the quarter for the Medupi power
station by Eskom Holdings Ltd., the South African state power
utility. Australian engineering and construction division
McConnell Dowell won contracts including the AU$43 million ($42
million) Breakwater Road Alignment project in Victoria,
Australia.  Aveng rose  2 percent to 43 rand at 12:08 p.m. in
Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
