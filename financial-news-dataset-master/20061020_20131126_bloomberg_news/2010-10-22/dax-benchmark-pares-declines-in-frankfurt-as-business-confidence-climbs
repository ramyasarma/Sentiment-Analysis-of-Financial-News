German stocks pared declines after a
report showed the country’s business confidence unexpectedly
climbed in October to the highest level in three and a half
years.  The benchmark DAX Index dropped less than 0.1 percent to
6,609.61 as of 9:59 a.m. in Frankfurt, paring earlier declines
of as much as 0.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
