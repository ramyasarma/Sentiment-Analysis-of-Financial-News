Singapore Exchange Ltd. is in talks
to combine with ASX Ltd., which runs the Australian stock
exchange, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.   The companies haven’t determined a final structure for the
deal, said the person, requesting anonymity because discussions
are private. Both stocks were suspended from trading today.  The Singaporean bourse may make a takeover bid for ASX,
Australia’s dominant stock exchange operator, on Oct. 25, the
Australian newspaper reported on its website today. Matthew
Gibbs, an ASX spokesman, had no comment beyond a statement today
accompanying a request for a trading halt. Singapore Exchange
spokeswoman Magdalyn Liew couldn’t be reached.    To contact the reporter on this story:
