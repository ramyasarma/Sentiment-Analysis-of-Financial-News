JFE Holdings Inc. , Japan’s second-
largest steelmaker, posted a 41 percent gain in the second-
quarter profit as growing economies in Asia boosted demand.  Net income  totaled 18.1 billion yen ($223 million) in the
three months ended Sept. 30, according to figures derived from
first-half results announced by the Tokyo-based company today.
That compares with a 12.8 billion yen profit a year earlier.
Sales gained 14 percent to 817.6 billion yen.  Steelmakers in Japan, the world’s second-largest producer
after China, are targeting sales in Asia to offset slower
domestic demand. Global steel demand will grow 5.3 percent next
year, led by gains in India and Brazil while consumption in
Japan declines, the World Steel Association said Oct. 4.  JFE Holdings today cut its full-year net income forecast by
8.3 percent to 110 billion yen. Sales for the year ending March
31 will probably reach 3.36 trillion, compared with its July 27
estimate of 3.42 trillion yen.  Posco, South Korea’s third-largest steelmaker, last week
cut its full-year profit forecast by 7 percent after reporting
the first decline in earnings in four quarters.  Nippon Steel
Corp. , Japan’s largest steelmaker, is scheduled to report first-
half result on Oct. 27.  Shares  of JFE Holdings rose as much as 1.5 percent to 2,640
yen and traded at 2,632 yen as of 1:17 p.m. on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
