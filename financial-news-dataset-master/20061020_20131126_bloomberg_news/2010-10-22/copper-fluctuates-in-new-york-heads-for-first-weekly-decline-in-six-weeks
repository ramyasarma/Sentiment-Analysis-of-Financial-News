Copper prices rose on speculation
the dollar’s rally will stall, boosting demand for metals as
alternative investments.  The greenback headed for a weekly gain against a basket of
major currencies, snapping a five-week slump. The dollar had
declined on bets the  Federal Reserve  will boost its monetary
stimulus to bolster the economy. This week, copper dropped 1.1
percent, ending a five-week rally.  “Near-term commodity price action seem to be dominated by
dollar moves,” said Daniel Major, an analyst at RBS Global
Banking & Markets in  London .  Copper futures for December delivery rose 1.55 cents, or
0.4 percent, to settle at $3.797 a pound at 1:22 p.m. on the
Comex. Earlier, the price dropped as much as 0.8 percent as the
dollar fluctuated. The metal gained 13 percent in the previous
five weeks.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose $27, or 0.3 percent, to $8,334 a metric ton ($3.78 a
pound). The price has climbed 26 percent in the past year.  Aluminum, lead and zinc also gained. Nickel and tin fell.  To contact the reporter on the story:
