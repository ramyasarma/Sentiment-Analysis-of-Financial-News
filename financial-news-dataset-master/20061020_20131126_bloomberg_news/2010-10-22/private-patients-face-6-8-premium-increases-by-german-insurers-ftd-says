Germany’s private health insurers
will have to raise premiums by between six percent and eight
percent to assure reserve funds for their elderly members,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported today, citing its own
calculations.  The insurers, which have reserve funds worth 144 billion
euros ($201 billion), guarantee interest rates on the assets of
3.5 percent, which they can’t realize at the moment because of
the low interest rate level, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
