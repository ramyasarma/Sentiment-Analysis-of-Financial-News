     Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) --Bank of  America Corp. , the largest
U.S. lender, may be downgraded by Fitch Ratings on concern that
new legislation will limit government support of the biggest
financial firms.  The issuer-default grades were placed on “Rating Watch
Negative” on the “interpretation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its implications for
systemically important” institutions, Fitch said today in a
statement on the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank.  Lawmakers overhauled financial regulations this year to
avoid a repeat of the bailouts that aided financial firms
including Bank of America, which received $45 billion in
assistance. The bank, which repaid the aid, has declined about
13 percent in New York  trading  this month on concern that
revenue may be curbed by new federal rules and the company could
be forced to buy back more faulty mortgages.  Bank of America has an “A+" long-term issuer-default
rating, Fitch said. The grade includes a three-grade “uplift,”
reflecting the possibility of government support.  Bank of America is building a “fortress balance sheet” to
avoid the need for U.S. assistance, Chief Executive Officer
 Brian Moynihan  said at a Sept. 14 conference call. The bank’s
tangible common equity, a cushion against loan losses,
more than doubled in the 30 months ended June 30 to $122
billion, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
