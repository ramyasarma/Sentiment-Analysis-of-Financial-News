Aberdeen Asset Management Plc  will
shut down its 1.3 billion-euro ($1.8 billion)  Degi Europa  mutual
property fund because of a surge in the number of investors
wanting their money back.  The fund aims to sell all of its property assets within
three years, returning money to its mostly German investors in
half-yearly installments starting January 2011, Aberdeen Asset
Management’s German unit said on its  website  today.  The fund halted all redemptions at the end of October 2008,
when investors scrambled to withdraw money as the financial
crisis escalated. The fund was scheduled to open again on Oct.
30, after reaching the two-year limit for suspending
redemptions. During that time, falling property values made it
more difficult for the fund to carry out disposals.  Last month, Kanam Grund Kapitalanlagesellschaft mbH became
the first asset manager in 50 years to close a German real
estate mutual fund when the Frankfurt-based company announced
the liquidation of its  US-Grundinvest  fund. Morgan Stanley is
scheduled to open its  P2 Value  fund Nov. 1 after suspending
redemptions two years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
