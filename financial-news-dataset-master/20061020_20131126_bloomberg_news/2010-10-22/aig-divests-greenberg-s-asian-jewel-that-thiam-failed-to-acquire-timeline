American International Group Inc. (AIG)  has
cut a tie to its founding in Asia as the company winds down bets
on non-U.S.  life insurance .  AIG completed its last offering of  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  shares,
raising $6.45 billion, the New York-based company said today.
Hong Kong-based AIA is among divisions labeled a “ crown jewel ”
by former Chief Executive Officer Maurice “Hank” Greenberg.  The following is a timeline of AIG’s growth in Asia,
followed by divestitures as the company repaid a U.S. rescue.  1919: Cornelius Vander Starr founds American Asiatic
Underwriters in Shanghai.  1921: Starr  establishes  Asia Life Insurance Co., which will
later become American Life Insurance Co., known as Alico.  1931: Starr establishes International Assurance Co., which later
becomes American International Assurance Co., also known as AIA.  1969: AIG, formed to hold Starr-founded companies, goes public.  1992: AIA is the first  foreign-owned  life- and non-life
insurance business to receive a license in China, according to
the company’s website.  2004: Non-U.S. life is one of AIG’s “crown jewels,” Greenberg
says. The business “could not be replicated” by rivals.  May 2006: AIA wins approval to sell group life in China.  April 9, 2008: AIG projects operating profit from life insurance
outside the U.S. will climb 88 percent by 2012 to $12 billion.  Sept. 16, 2008: The U.S. bails out AIG after the insurer is
overwhelmed by losses on bets tied to the U.S. housing market.  Oct. 3, 2008: AIG will sell life-insurance operations in the
U.S., Europe,  Latin America  and Japan and keep a majority stake
in AIA, “if at all possible,” says then-CEO  Edward Liddy .  Dec. 1, 2009: AIG is allowed to reduce its draw on a Federal
Reserve credit line by $25 billion in anticipation of proceeds
from divestitures of AIA and Alico.  March 1, 2010: AIG agrees to sell AIA to  Prudential Plc (PRU)  for
$35.5 billion in cash and securities. CEO  Robert Benmosche  says
the deal will provide funds on a “faster track” than an IPO.  March 8, 2010:  MetLife Inc. (MET)  agrees to buy Alico for about $16
billion.  June 2, 2010: Prudential Plc, led by Tidjane Thiam, says it 
terminated the deal after shareholders balked at the price.  Sept. 30, 2010:  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  agrees to buy AIG Star
Life Insurance Co. and AIG Edison Life Insurance Co. for about
$4.8 billion to expand in Japan.  October 2010: AIG raises $20.5 billion selling a 67 percent
stake in AIA in Hong Kong’s largest public offering.  Jan. 12, 2011: AIG agrees to sell Taipei-based Nan Shan Life
Insurance Co. to Ruen Chen Investment Holding Co.  March 6, 2012: AIG sells about $6 billion of AIA shares.  Sept. 6, 2012: AIG sells about $2 billion of AIA shares, cutting
stake to 14 percent.  Dec. 10, 2012: The U.S. says it is selling the last of its
shares acquired in the AIG bailout. The government’s profit on
the rescue is about $22.7 billion.  Dec. 18, 2012: AIG says it sold the last of its AIA shares in an
offering that raised $6.45 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
