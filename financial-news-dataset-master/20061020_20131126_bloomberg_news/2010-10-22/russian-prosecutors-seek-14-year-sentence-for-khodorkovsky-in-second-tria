Russian prosecutors sought a 14-year
sentence in the embezzlement trial of former Yukos Oil Co.
billionaire  Mikhail Khodorkovsky , who is due to be released from
prison next year on a previous conviction.  The prosecution requested the sentence today in a Moscow
courtroom,  Maxim Dbar , a spokesman for Khodorkovsky’s defense
team, said by telephone.  Defense lawyers expect time served under the first
conviction will be counted toward a new sentence, Dbar said.
Khodorkovsky and his former partner  Platon Lebedev , who faces
the same charges of stealing oil from Yukos, are due to make
their closing arguments next week.  Khodorkovsky, 47, is already serving an eight-year sentence
for fraud following a trial he said was motivated by his
opposition to Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin , who was president
at the time of his 2003 arrest. Yukos, once Russia’s largest oil
company, was bankrupted under a $30 billion tax claim and sold
off in pieces to state oil company OAO Rosneft.  Putin, 58, has denied any involvement in the case, saying
Khodorkovsky’s first conviction was the work of an independent
judiciary and that the second trial came as a surprise to him.
Khodorkovsky “deserved his punishment,” Putin told  Kommersant 
newspaper in an August interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
