A strike by  Kenyan  tea-industry
workers entered its fifth day today, with labor unions and
employers disputing the level of support and the reason for a
breakdown in talks.  About 20,000 workers are on strike, Francis Atwoli,
secretary general of the Central Organization of Trade Unions in
Kenya, said by phone from the capital, Nairobi, today. The
strike continued after managers failed to attend a meeting
scheduled for yesterday.  The Kenya Tea Growers Association said they were unaware of
the planned meeting and that the strike was not having a major
impact. Kenya is the world’s biggest exporter of black tea.
Production may increase by 11 percent to 350 million kilograms
(770 million pounds) this year, the Kenya Tea Board said last
month.  “Most workers are reporting to work as usual and those who
went on strike are slowly coming back to work,” said Charles
Kipng’ok, chairman of the Tea Growers Association.  Workers are striking over the increased use of picking
machines, each one of which can replace 60 workers, according to
Henry Omasire, second assistant general secretary at the Kenya
Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union.  Atwoli said that he has summoned union representatives from
all over the country for a meeting tomorrow to encourage them to
continue with the strike until the issue is resolved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
