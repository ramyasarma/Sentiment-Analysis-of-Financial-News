Deutsche Telekom AG  and the Greek
government agreed to appoint  Michael Tsamaz  as the new chief
executive officer and chairman of  Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA , the German company’s Greek unit.  Tsamaz, who heads Cosmote, the company’ mobile-phone unit,
will take over from  Panagis Vourloumis  on Nov. 3, according to
an e-mailed statement from Athens-based Hellenic Telecom, known
as OTE. Deutsche Telekom owns 30 percent of Hellenic and the
Greek government 20 percent.  “OTE has a crucial role in the country’s development and
the broader region and in enhancing the competitiveness of the
Greek economy,” Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said
in the statement. “Tsamaz, as a common choice of the main
shareholders of the organization, will successfully face the
difficult tasks ahead.”  Shares of Hellenic Telecom added 3 percent to 5.78 euros on
the Athens Stock Exchange, valuing the business at 2.8 billion
euros ($3.9 billion).  Tsamaz has headed Cosmote since September 2007 and been an
executive at Hellenic Telecom since 2001. He takes over from
Vourloumis, who was appointed in 2004. Under Vourloumis, the
company cut its workforce and sold unprofitable units in Greece
and other countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
