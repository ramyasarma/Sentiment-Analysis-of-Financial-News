Volvo AB , the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, reported a third consecutive quarterly profit,
beating analysts’ estimates, after demand recovered.  Third-quarter  net income  was 2.81 billion kronor ($423
million), compared with a loss of 2.92 billion kronor a year
earlier, the Gothenburg, Sweden-based company said today in a
 statement . Profit was projected at 2.47 billion kronor,
according to the average estimate of 13 analysts  surveyed  by
Bloomberg.  Revenue  rose 32 percent to 64 billion kronor.  Volvo, which cut thousands of jobs during the financial
crisis as demand plummeted, is benefiting from rebounding heavy
truck markets in North America and Asia. Volvo is first among
Europe’s truckmakers to report earnings. The heavy-truck
division, Volvo’s largest unit, said third-quarter orders
increased 59 percent to 50,869 vehicles.  “They will have to rely on Asia, South America and also
North America to drive the growth going into 2011, and then
slowly I see Europe picking up,” said  Morten Imsgard , an
analyst with Sydbank A/S in Aabenraa, Denmark, who has an
“overweight” rating on Volvo.  Volvo fell 1.85 kronor, or 1.9 percent, to 93.90 kronor at
the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Stockholm, paring the stock’s
gains this year to 53 percent. Domestic rival  Scania AB  has
jumped 65 percent this year.  Daimler AG , the world’s largest
truckmaker, has risen 32 percent.  Cash Flow  “The cash flow was a weakness,”  Niclas Hoglund , an
analyst at Swedbank Markets who rates Volvo at “strong buy,”
said by telephone in explaining today’s stock drop.  Third-quarter cash flow was a negative 1.9 billion kronor
in Volvo’s industrial operations, compared with negative 1.4
billion kronor a year earlier.  The manufacturer today forecast 2011 heavy-truck sales in
North America and Europe will top 200,000 vehicles in both
regions.  Volvo also maintained its projection that sales will grow
10 percent in 2010 in Europe and between 20 and 30 percent in
North America. That would mean deliveries of about 180,400
trucks in Europe and as many as 153,400 in North America.  Volvo returned to  profit  in the first quarter, after five
consecutive losses totaling 16.1 billion kronor, lifted by cost
cuts and demand spurred by the economic recovery.  The heavy-truck division’s sales advanced 36 percent to
41.2 billion kronor in the quarter.  Raised Production  The construction-equipment  unit , the company’s second-
largest division, said revenue soared 55 percent to 12.7 billion
kronor on demand in Brazil, Russia, India and China.  “We are raising the production rates in most of our
manufacturing facilities,” Chief Executive Officer  Leif Johansson  said in the statement. “The overall demand situation
continues to improve.”  Brazil, India, China and Russia accounted for a combined 19
percent of group sales in the quarter.  Scania will publish results Oct. 25, while Daimler and  MAN
AG  will report earnings Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
