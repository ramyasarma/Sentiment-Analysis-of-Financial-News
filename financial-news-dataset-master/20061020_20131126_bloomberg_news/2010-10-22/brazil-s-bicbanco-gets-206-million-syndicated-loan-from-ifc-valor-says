     Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) --  Banco Industrial e Comercial SA , the
Sao Paulo-based lender known as BicBanco, got a $206 million
loan from a group of banks led by International Finance Corp.,
the World Bank’s private investment arm, Valor Economico said.  The syndicated loan is the largest made to a financial
institution in Latin America led by IFC, according to the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper, which cited Milto Bardini, BicBanco’s
vice-president, and Paulo de Bolle, who is responsible for
financial institutions at IFC in Brazil.  BicBanco will use the proceeds to finance companies with
annual revenue of as much as 150 million reais ($88 million),
Bolle told Valor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
