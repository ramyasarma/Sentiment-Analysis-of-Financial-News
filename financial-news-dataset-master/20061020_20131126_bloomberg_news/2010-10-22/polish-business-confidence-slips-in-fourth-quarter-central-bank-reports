Polish companies expect economic
growth to moderate in the fourth quarter as the pace of export
orders and domestic demand slows, the central bank said today.  The Narodowy Bank Polski’s business outlook index, based on
a survey of 1,006 companies, fell for the second consecutive
quarter, the central bank said. Twenty percent of companies
expect economic conditions to improve in the fourth quarter,
down from 22 percent in the third quarter, while 6 percent
expect them to worsen, the Warsaw-based bank said in the report,
released on its website today.  Capacity utilization in industry rose 0.5 percentage points
to 79.6 percent in the third quarter, the central bank said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
