Daimler AG  will grow sales by more
than 10 percent next year in China, which is set to become the
Mercedes-Benz unit’s biggest market by 2015, Chief Executive
Officer  Dieter Zetsche  said today.  Deliveries will increase by a “double-digit” percentage
in 2011, Zetsche said today in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. The world’s second-largest  maker  of luxury cars
expects to sell 120,000 vehicles in the country this year, up
from a previous forecast of 100,000, he said.  Daimler, General Motors Co. and Nissan Motor Co. are
expanding in China as rising incomes and a growing economy boost
sales in the world’s largest auto market. Stuttgart, Germany-
based Daimler is seeking to close the gap with luxury leader
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and fend off  Volkswagen AG ’s Audi
division.  “The prospects for premium cars in China have been
excellent and we have no reason to believe why that should
change,” Zetsche said during his third trip to the country this
year, this time for a Mercedes-Benz star-lighting ceremony for
the Daimler Tower in Beijing.  Daimler, which has ventures with Beijing Automotive
Industry Holding Co. and Fujian Motors Group, plans to double
passenger-car capacity in China in five years, the CEO said. The
automaker currently has capacity to produce 100,000 units
annually.  Beating Targets  The carmaker also plans to introduce an electric car with
 Warren Buffett -backed BYD Co. as early as 2012, Zetsche said.
Mercedes-Benz hit its initial 2010 target in the first nine
months of the year, with sales of 101,350 units, the company
said Oct. 11.  Daimler’s September sales in China surged 98 percent to
13,500 vehicles, compared with  BMW ’s 89 percent gain to 15,379
units and a 45 percent increase at Audi, the luxury leader in
China, to 22,125 autos.  “If you take a car manufacturer that has to grow, has to
sell cars, they can no longer count on the mature markets,”
said  Klaus Paur , a Shanghai-based independent auto analyst.
“For growth, they have to come to China.”  Economic growth, rising affluence on the mainland and low
levels of car ownership make China an increasingly important
market for luxury carmakers, Paur, who has covered the industry
for 15 years, said by telephone.  Engine Factory  Daimler  will start making engines in China in three years,
and doesn’t expect overcapacity problems, Zetsche told reporters
separately.  The carmaker will build an engine plant as part of a 3
billion-euro ($4.2 billion) investment in China. The factory is
due to start production in 2013.  Daimler, which is also the world’s largest truckmaker,
raised its 2010 operating-profit forecast to 6 billion euros on
July 27 after beating quarterly estimates on higher sales in
China and the U.S.  The shares rose 6.5 cents, or 0.1 percent, to 49.10 euros
at 1:54 p.m. in Frankfurt. They have gained 32 percent this
year, valuing the carmaker at 52 billion euros.  Auto sales on the mainland may rise 25 percent to 17
million units this year, Xinhua News Agency reported this month,
citing the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The
nation overtook the U.S. as the world’s largest car market last
year, with a record 13.6 million vehicles sold, according
China’s State Information Center.  -- Liza Lin  in Shanghai,  Michael Wei  and  Stephen Engle  in
