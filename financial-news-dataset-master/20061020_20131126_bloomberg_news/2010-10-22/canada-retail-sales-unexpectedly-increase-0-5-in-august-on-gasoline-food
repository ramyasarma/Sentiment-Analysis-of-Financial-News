Canadian  retail sales  rose at the
fastest pace in six months in August, an unexpected gain led by
products ranging from gasoline to food and furniture.  Sales advanced 0.5 percent to C$36.1 billion ($35.2
billion), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg anticipated a 0.1 percent decline,
according to the median of 15 estimates.  Sales at gasoline stations rose 2.1 percent, and motor
vehicle and parts-dealers sales gained 0.7 percent. Six of 11
categories advanced in August, accounting for 70 percent of
total sales, including a 2.1 percent gain at furniture stores.  Consumer spending may slow as households manage record debt
loads and the government ends stimulus spending, the Bank of
Canada said Oct. 20 as it reduced its economic-growth forecast
for the next five quarters. The bank kept its key lending rate
at 1 percent this week and said any increase would be
“carefully considered.”  Excluding car and parts dealers, retail  sales  rose 0.4
percent to C$28.1 billion, compared with the 0.5 percent
increase expected by economists.  Sales excluding the automotive industry and gasoline
stations climbed 0.1 percent.  Statistics Canada also revised its estimate for July total
retail sales to a 0.1 percent increase, from a 0.1 percent
decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
