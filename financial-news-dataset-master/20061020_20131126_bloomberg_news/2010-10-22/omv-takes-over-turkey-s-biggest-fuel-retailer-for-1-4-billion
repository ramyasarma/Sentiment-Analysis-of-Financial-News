OMV AG , central Europe’s biggest oil
company, has agreed to take over Turkey’s biggest fuel retailer
for 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to tap faster growth in
emerging markets.  OMV will buy Dogan Sirketler Grubu Holding AS’s 54.17
percent holding in  Petrol Ofisi AS , boosting its stake to 95.75
percent from 41.58 percent, OMV said in a statement yesterday
after markets closed. Before completion, likely within three
months, Petrol Ofisi will distribute $488 million in dividends
to shareholders, with $203 million going to OMV, $265 million to
Dogan and $21 million to free-float investors.  OMV is expanding in emerging markets to tap faster demand
growth. Petrol Ofisi has 3,140 gasoline stations in Turkey,
where oil consumption rose 5.8 percent in 2008, according to BP
Plc. That compares with a 0.1 percent decline in Austria.  OMV wants to  maintain  a “strong investment grade credit
rating and therefore does not exclude raising equity as one of
the available funding options,” it said in the statement.  While OMV’s purchase price is a 5.4 percent discount to
yesterday’s close of 6.75 liras per  share , it’s a 2 percent
premium compared with the closing share price on Oct. 20, when
Dogan and OMV announced they were in talks on Petrol Ofisi.  OMV has held a stake in Petrol Ofisi since 2006, when it
bought 34 percent of the company for $1.06 billion. This is
OMV’s second attempt to take over the Turkish retailer, after
negotiations were terminated in November last year because of a
dispute between Dogan and Turkish tax authorities.  “Turkey represents a strategic bridgehead to the resource-
rich Caspian Region and the Middle East,” the company said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
