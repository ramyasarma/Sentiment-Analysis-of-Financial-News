South Korea proposed that Group of
20 nations address current account surpluses to fix imbalances
in the global economy rather than focus exclusively on exchange
rates, a government official said.  If talks focus only on foreign exchange, surplus nations
have no flexibility and will find it hard to agree, the South
Korean official said in Gyeongju in the country’s south, where
finance ministers and central bankers from G-20 nations are
meeting today. Looking at the current account will allow surplus
countries to decide on which tools to adopt, including exchange
rate appreciation, he said.  South Korea’s government is not proposing talks on a
“standstill policy” that would prevent government’s using new
tools to affect the value of their currencies, the official said.
Maeil Business Newspaper earlier reported South Korea was
seeking to have this proposal included in any communiqué to come
from the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
