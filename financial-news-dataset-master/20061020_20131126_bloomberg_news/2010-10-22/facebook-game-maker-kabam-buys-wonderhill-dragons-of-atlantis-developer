Facebook Inc. game developer  Kabam 
acquired WonderHill, the maker of “Dragons of Atlantis” game,
as it seeks to expand operations in the U.S. and Germany.  The purchase of  WonderHill  will help the Redwood City,
California-based Kabam to have more than 200 people in the U.S.,
China and Germany, 10 times the staff it had at the start of the
year,  Andy Lee , Kabam’s Asia managing director, said in an
interview in Beijing today. Lee didn’t disclose the terms of the
acquisition, the first by the maker of “Kingdoms of Camelot.”  WonderHill, the San Francisco-based developer of Facebook
games including “Tattoo City,” has offices in Germany. That
will be Kabam’s second facility outside the U.S., following the
establishment of a studio in Beijing in May, Lee said.  “We are continuing to look at potential acquisition
targets and strategic partners throughout” the Asian region,
Lee said. The company may use Beijing as its base for expansion
in South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, he said.  Closely held Kabam, which changed its name from Watercooler
in August, has raised about $9.5 million from London-based
Betfair Group Ltd. and Canaan Partners in Westport, Connecticut,
Lee said.  -- Edmond Lococo . Editors:  Vipin V. Nair ,  Suresh Seshadri .  To contact the reporter on this story:
