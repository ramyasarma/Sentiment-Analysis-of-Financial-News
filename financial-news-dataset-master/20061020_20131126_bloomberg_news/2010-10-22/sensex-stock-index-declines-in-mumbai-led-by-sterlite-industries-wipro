India’s stocks fell, paring a weekly
gain, after mixed quarterly earnings reports weakened confidence
in the nation’s economic recovery.  Wipro Ltd. , the nation’s third-largest software exporter,
tumbled the most in almost nine months after net income fell
short of expectations.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the
biggest copper producer, dropped to a three-week low amid
speculation it will lower sales guidance when results are
released on Oct. 26, according to Shah Investor’s Home Ltd.’s
analyst  Abhishek Jain .  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.  rose to a
record as its 32 percent profit growth outpaced rivals.  “Some of the results haven’t been that good,” said
 Avinash Gupta , an analyst at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd., a New
Delhi-based brokerage. “The results are not giving a very clear
direction of whether we’re strongly up or strongly down.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 94.72, or 0.5 percent, to 20,165.86 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The gauge climbed 0.2 percent this week,
reversing a two-week drop. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the
National Stock Exchange dropped 0.6 percent to 6,066.05. The  BSE
200 Index  declined 0.3 percent to 2,568.74.  Wipro fell 4.5 percent to 448.9 rupees, its steepest drop
since Jan. 27. Second-quarter profit lagged behind analyst
estimates as the stronger rupee cuts profit margins of
exporters.  Net income  rose 9.4 percent to 12.8 billion rupees
($287 million) in the three months ended in September,
Bangalore-based Wipro said today. That compared with the 13.4
billion rupee average of 34 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The company reported earnings according to
International Financial Reporting Standards.  Tata Consultancy  Tata Consultancy jumped 5.5 percent to 1,040.2 rupees, its
highest close since the shares were listed in August 2004. Net
income rose to 21.7 billion rupees in the three months ended
September.  Infosys Technologies Ltd. , the second-largest
software exporter, climbed 0.6 percent to 3,053.15 rupees.  Sterlite fell 2.4 percent to 168.2 rupees, its lowest level
since Sept. 30.  “There are concerns that Sterlite Industries may lower
their sales guidance for the current fiscal year,” said Jain,
who has a ‘buy’ recommendation on the company. “Investors are
unwinding positions ahead of the company’s results.”  Overseas  investors  bought a net  8.11 billion rupees  of
Indian equities on Oct. 20, extending this year’s record inflows
to 1.09 trillion rupees, according to the nation’s market
regulator.  Global funds have been net buyers of stocks for 36 trading
days, the longest run of inflows in more than five years since
the 40-day period ended Aug. 9, 2005, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
