Soybeans rose, heading for the third
straight weekly advance, on mounting Chinese demand for oilseed
to make animal feed and cooking oil.  In the week ended Oct. 14, U.S. soybean  sales  surged 85
percent to 2.02 million metric tons from a week earlier, the
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. About 72 percent of
that total was to China. Since then, exporters reported sales of
1.38 million tons to China and unknown destinations, the agency
said. The U.S. is the world’s biggest grower and exporter.  “China is buying U.S. soybeans at a record pace, and that
probably won’t slow,” said  Joseph Vaclavik , a commodity broker
at Advantage Traders Group LLC  in Chicago.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 2.25 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $12.1525 a bushel at 10:36 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Yesterday, the price reached $12.35, the highest
level for a most-active contract since June 5, 2009.  Chinese  profit margins  on crushing soybeans have surged 79
percent in past year as livestock-feed demand rose, according to
data from Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd.  “Chinese processors are making too much money to slow
imports,” Vaclavik said.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
