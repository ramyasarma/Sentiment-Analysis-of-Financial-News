Copper declined for a second day,
heading for the first weekly drop in six weeks, as the dollar’s
rebound damped the appeal of commodities as alternative
investments. Zinc and lead also fell.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.2 percent to $8,288 a metric ton,
before trading at $8,306 a ton by 8:02 a.m. in Singapore, down
1.1 percent this week.  Zinc fell 0.4 percent to $2,464 a ton, after climbing to
the highest level since April yesterday. Lead lost 0.6 percent,
after rising to the highest price since January yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
