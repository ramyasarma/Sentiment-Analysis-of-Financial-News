A freighter collided with a
passenger ferry on the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal between Nieuwer Ter
Aa and Breukelen, Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf said today,
without citing anyone.  An unknown number of people fell overboard and the ferry’s
captain is missing, the newspaper said. The ferry carries
pedestrians and cyclists across the canal, De Telegraaf said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
