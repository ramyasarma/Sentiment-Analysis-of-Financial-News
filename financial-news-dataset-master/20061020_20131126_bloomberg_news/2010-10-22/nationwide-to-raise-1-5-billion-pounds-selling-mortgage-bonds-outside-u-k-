Nationwide Building Society, the
U.K.’s largest customer-owned lender, will raise 1.5 billion
pounds ($2.35 billion) selling mortgage-backed securities,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  The deal includes $550 million of bonds with an average
life of three years yielding about 140 basis points over Libor
and 1.1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of bonds expected to mature
in 2015 yielding a spread of about 150 basis points, said the
people, who declined to be identified because terms are private.  Another $300 million tranche with a five-year average life
may pay a spread of 150 basis points, said the people. Libor, or
the London interbank offered rate, is the rate banks charge to
lend to each other. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The securities will be sold through Silverstone 2010-1.
Nationwide, based in Swindon, England, is targeting buyers
outside its home country in the first securitization from a
British bank denominated entirely in non-U.K. currencies since
August 2005, when Northern Rock Plc priced $1 billion of debt
through Granite 2005-3, according to Societe Generale SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
