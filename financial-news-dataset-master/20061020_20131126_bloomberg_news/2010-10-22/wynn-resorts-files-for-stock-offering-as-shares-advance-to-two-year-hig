Wynn Resorts Ltd. , owner of Wynn and
Encore casinos in Las Vegas and Macau, filed with regulators to
sell shares, taking advantage of a two-year high in the stock.  The Las Vegas-based casino owner today filed a shelf
registration and prospectus with U.S.  regulators , enabling it to
sell an undisclosed number of shares.  Wynn, founded by billionaire  Steve Wynn , would follow Las
Vegas rivals MGM Resorts International and Harrah’s
Entertainment Inc. in seeking to raise capital as a record slump
in Las Vegas eases and casino securities rally. Las Vegas Strip
gambling revenue jumped 21 percent in August, Nevada’s Gaming
Control Board said.  MGM Resorts, the biggest Las Vegas Strip operator, took in
$511 million last week in a share sale. Harrah’s, the world’s
biggest casino company which was taken private in January 2008,
said this week it plans an initial public offering that will
include selling stock to raise as much as $575 million for
planned projects in Las Vegas and Ohio.  Wynn fell $1.87 to $102.55 in extended activity after the
filing. The shares rose $1.18 to $104.42 in regular Nasdaq Stock
Market  trading , the highest close since August 2008.  Wynn had 123.5 million common shares outstanding as of Aug.
2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, giving the company a
 market value  of $12.9 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
