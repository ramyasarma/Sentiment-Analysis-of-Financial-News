Brazil’s real completed the biggest
weekly decline since June after the government raised a tax on
foreigners’ fixed-income purchases for the second time this
month to stem the currency’s appreciation and bolster exports.  The real dropped 2.4 percent to 1.7057 per dollar from
1.6651 on Oct. 15, the biggest slide since the week ended June
4. The currency fell 0.5 percent today. The real had gained for
nine straight weeks through Oct. 15.  “The measures are weakening the currency and the
perception that you can have more measures, one after another,
is impacting the currency,” said  Marcelo Portilho , a strategist
at Safra Corretora in Sao Paulo.  Brazil announced Oct. 18 an increase in the tax on
foreigners’ investments in fixed-income securities to 6 percent
from 4 percent. It also boosted the levy on money brought into
the country to make margin deposits for futures market trades to
6 percent from 0.38 percent.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 jumped 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point,
this week to 11.36 percent. It rose two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
