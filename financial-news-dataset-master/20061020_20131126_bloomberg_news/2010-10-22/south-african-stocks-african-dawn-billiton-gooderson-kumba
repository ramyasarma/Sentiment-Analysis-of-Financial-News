South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  fell for the first day in three, losing 249.9, or
0.8 percent, to 30,189.56 at 10:19 a.m. in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  African Dawn Capital Ltd.  (ADW SJ), a financial services
provider, fell 1 cent, or 7.1 percent, to 13 cents, its third
drop this week. African Dawn said talks are ongoing with
potential liquidity providers.  BHP Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ), the world’s biggest mining
company, dropped 3.40 rand, or 1.4 percent, snapping two days of
increases. Billiton may sell as much as $33 billion of non-core
assets, including its South African coal unit and aluminum
smelters, should its takeover bid for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. succeed, Deutsche Bank AG said.  Gooderson Leisure Corp.  (GDN SJ), the hotel operator and
food-services company, fell for the first time in almost two
weeks, retreating 1 cent, or 1.8 percent, to 54 cents. The
company said per-share earnings fell as much as 95 percent in
the six months through August.  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd.  (KIO SJ) slipped the most in two weeks,
retreating 9 rand, or 2.2 percent, to 401.50 rand. The company
was reduced to “sell” from “hold” at Deutsche Bank by equity
analyst  Tim Clark , while its 12-month price estimate was set at
375 rand per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
