Japan granted antitrust immunity for
 Japan Airlines Corp.  and  All Nippon Airways Co.  to cooperate
with partners on U.S. flights, clearing the way for deals that
may cut costs and boost sales.  Japan Air won approval for its alliance with  AMR Corp. ’s
American Airlines, and All Nippon for its partnership with
 United Continental Holdings Inc. ’s United and Continental units,
Japan’s transport ministry said today in a statement.  The U.S. and Japan are set to sign an “Open Skies” accord
on Oct. 25 that will end limits on how many carriers can fly
between the two countries and what prices they can charge. The
U.S. gave preliminary antitrust approval earlier this month,
subject to the agreement being signed.  “The joint business with American will contribute to the
growth and stability of both our businesses,” Japan Air
President  Masaru Onishi  said in a statement. “We are intent on
keeping the marketplace competitive.”  All Nippon rose 0.3 percent to 301 yen as of the 11 a.m.
close of trade in Tokyo. Japan Airlines, which is restructuring
under bankruptcy protection, was delisted from the Tokyo Stock
Exchange in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
