Rubber decreased for a third day,
booking the first loss in six weeks amid concern that demand
from China may weaken after the world’s biggest consumer raised
interest rates and its  economy  expanded at a slower pace.  The most-active contract on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
lost as much as 1.2 percent to 330.5 yen per kilogram ($4,071 a
metric ton) before settling at 333.8 yen. It lost 1.8 percent
this week after setting a 27-month high of 343 yen Oct. 15.  China’s first increase in interest rates since 2007 stoked
speculation that the fastest-growing major economy may take
additional steps to curb inflation and prevent asset-price
bubbles, said  Takaki Shigemoto , an analyst at JSC Corp. in Tokyo.
The nation’s inflation accelerated in September to the fastest
pace in 23 months.  “The rubber market was capped by concern that higher
Chinese rates may have a negative impact on consumption,
especially car sales,” Shigemoto said by phone today.  March-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange lost
0.6 percent to 31,000 yuan ($4,657) a ton, declining 3.3 this
week. It climbed to a record 33,000 yuan on Oct. 19.  China’s central bank raised the benchmark one-year lending
rate to 5.56 percent from 5.31 percent and the  deposit rate  to
2.5 percent from 2.25 percent on Oct. 19.  Natural-rubber imports by China jumped 19 percent from a
month earlier to 190,000 tons in September as the country’s
 passenger-car sales  to dealerships quickened from August on
additional incentives for buyers.  Wholesale deliveries of passenger cars rose 19.3 percent to
1.21 million, accelerating from 18.7 percent in August, the
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said Oct. 12.  Declines Limited  Losses in rubber futures were limited by concern that wet
weather in Asian producing countries may limit supplies,
Shigemoto said. Central, northern and northeastern provinces in
Thailand, the world’s largest producer, were affected by floods
and rainfall across the country, the government said.  Heavy rains and flash floods inundated 24 provinces since
the beginning of October, damaging 1.7 million rai (0.7 million
acres) of farmland, according to Farm Minister  Theera Wongsamut .
The ministry will assess the damage after the waters recede, he
said in a statement.  A severe drought in Yunnan at the beginning of this year
and torrential rains this month in Hainan, the top two producing
areas in China, will reduce domestic rubber output, according to
Guo Cheng, an analyst at Yongan Futures Co.  Bridgestone Corp. , the world’s largest tire maker by sales,
expects total sales to rise 40 percent by 2015 from 2009, while
overall industrywide demand will rise by 15 percent in the same
period, it said in a press release today.  The Tokyo-based company also announced earlier today that
it will invest 24 billion yen to increase production capacity
for large tires and steel cords for vehicles used by
construction and mining companies.  The company may raise products prices to pass on higher raw
material costs, CFO Akihiro Eto told reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
