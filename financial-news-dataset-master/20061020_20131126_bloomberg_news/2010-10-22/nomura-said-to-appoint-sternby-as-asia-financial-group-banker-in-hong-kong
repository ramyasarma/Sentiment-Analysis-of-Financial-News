Nomura Holdings Inc.  plans to
appoint Petter Sternby, co-head of investment banking for the
Nordic region, as a managing director at its Asian financial
institutions group, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Sternby, who previously was a financial institutions banker
for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, plans to relocate to
Hong Kong from London as early as this year, the people said,
asking not to be identified before an announcement. He will
report to  Dan McNamara , global co-head of the group.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Bank of America Corp. and UBS AG
have moved bankers to focus on financial institutions in Asia
this year as banks and insurers are poised to raise record
amounts of money. The firms are facing increased competition for
advisory work from Nomura, Barclays Plc and  Daiwa Securities
Group Inc.   Financial firms are on course to raise record amounts of
money in Asia-Pacific this year, led by  Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd. ’s $22.1 billion initial public offering in July.
American International Group Inc. raised $17.8 billion in Hong
Kong’s biggest-ever IPO, people with knowledge of the matter
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
