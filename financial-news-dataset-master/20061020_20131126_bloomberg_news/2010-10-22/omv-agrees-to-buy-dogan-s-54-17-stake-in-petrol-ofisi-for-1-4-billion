OMV AG , central Europe’s biggest oil
company, agreed to buy Dogan Sirketler Grubu Holding AS’s stake
in  Petrol Ofisi AS  for 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) to tap
faster growth in emerging markets.  OMV is boosting its stake in Turkey’s biggest fuel retailer
to 95.75 percent from 41.58 percent, Vienna-based OMV said in a
statement today. Before the closing, likely within three months,
Petrol Ofisi will distribute $488 million in dividends to
shareholders, with $203 million going to OMV, $265 million to
Dogan and $21 million to free-float investors.  OMV is expanding in emerging markets to tap faster demand
growth. Petrol Ofisi has 3,140 gasoline stations in Turkey,
where oil consumption rose 5.8 percent in 2008, according to BP
Plc. That compares with a 0.1 percent decline in Austria.  OMV wants to  maintain  a “strong investment grade credit
rating and therefore does not exclude raising equity as one of
the available funding options,’’ it said in the statement.  OMV has held a stake in Petrol Ofisi since 2006, when it
bought 34 percent of the company for $1.06 billion.  “Turkey represents a strategic bridgehead to the resource-
rich Caspian Region and the Middle East,’’ the Vienna-based
company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
