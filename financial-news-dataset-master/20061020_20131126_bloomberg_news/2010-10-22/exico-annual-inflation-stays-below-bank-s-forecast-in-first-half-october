Mexico’s  consumer prices  rose in the
first half of October from a month earlier as the end of summer
electricity subsidies pushed up electricity costs. The annual
inflation rate remained below central bank forecasts.  Prices increased 0.48 percent in the first part of the
month, while core inflation was 0.18 percent, the central bank
said on its website. Economists expected prices to rise 0.40
percent and a core rate, which excludes some food and fuel
costs, of 0.17 percent, according to the  median estimates  of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The higher-than-forecast rate shouldn’t concern the central
bank, known as Banxico, because the increase was largely driven
by an expected rise in electricity rates, and because core
inflation remains benign, said  Jimena Zuniga , an economist at
Barclays Capital in New York.  “I wouldn’t draw too much from the headline rate,” Zuniga
said in a phone interview. “This won’t change at all Banxico’s
stance that inflation is trending below forecasts.”  Annual inflation quickened to 3.89 percent in the first
half of October from 3.70 percent in September, according to the
bank’s website. That remained below the 4.75 percent to 5.25
percent range forecast by the bank for the third quarter.  In separate reports, the national statistics agency today
reported that the unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent in
September. Economists expected a jobless rate of 5.35 percent,
according to the median of 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The institute also reported that Latin America’s second-
biggest economy had a preliminary trade deficit of $560 million
for September, down from a $699 million gap a month earlier and
a $879 million gap a year earlier.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 was
little changed at 6.35 percent today, according to Banco
Santander SA. The price rose 0.01 centavo to 133.97 centavos per
peso.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 12.4052 per dollar at 12:25
p.m. New York from 12.3908 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
