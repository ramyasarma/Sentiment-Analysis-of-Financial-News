The premium that investors demand to
hold Austrian government bonds instead of benchmark German bunds
is “way too high,” the nation’s debt chief said.  “The spread is now at 0.4 percentage points, which is
still way too high because Austria’s credit quality isn’t worse
than Germany’s,” Martha Oberndorfer, managing director of the
Austrian Federal Financing Agency told delegates at a conference
in Vienna. “The rating of the Republic of Austria was never at
risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
