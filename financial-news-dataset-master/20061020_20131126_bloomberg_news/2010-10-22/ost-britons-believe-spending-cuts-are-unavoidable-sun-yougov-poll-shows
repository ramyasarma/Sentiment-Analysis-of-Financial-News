Most Britons believe the cuts
announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  as part
of the U.K. spending review are unavoidable, The Sun  reported ,
citing a YouGov Plc poll commissioned by the tabloid newspaper.  Of those surveyed, 58 percent thought there was no
alternative to the 81 billion pounds ($127 billion) of cuts,
compared with 29 percent who considered them to be avoidable,
the newspaper said. Forty-one percent said the cuts would be
good, while a similar number thought they would be bad.  The former Labour government was blamed by 47 percent of
respondents as being responsible for creating the reasons for
the spending review, compared with 17 percent who blamed the new
Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition.  Asked who they would vote for if there was a general
election tomorrow, 41 percent favored the Conservatives, 40
percent the opposition Labour party while 10 percent backed the
LibDems.  YouGov interviewed 1,874 adults between Oct. 20 and Oct.
21, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
