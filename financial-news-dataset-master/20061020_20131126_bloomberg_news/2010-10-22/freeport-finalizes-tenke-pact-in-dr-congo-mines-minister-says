Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.
and the Democratic Republic of Congo agreed on a revised pact
for the Tenke Fungurume copper and cobalt project, Mines
Minister Martin Kabwelulu said by text message late yesterday.  The minister will announce the details of the revisions on
Friday in Kinshasa, he said. The Tenke project was the final
unresolved contract after a more than three-year review of
mining deals by the Congolese government. Freeport, the world’s
biggest publicly traded copper producer, has delayed expanding
the mine during the renegotiation process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
