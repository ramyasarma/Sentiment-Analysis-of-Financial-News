Grupa Lotos SA, Poland’s second-
largest oil refiner, will post a “large” net profit in the
third quarter as the stronger zloty reverses financial losses on
its dollar-denominated debt, Chief Executive Office Pawel
Olechnowicz was quoted today as saying in an interview on the
newspaper Rzeczpospolita’s rp.pl website.  Olechnowicz said that Lotos’s operating profit will be
“much better” than it was a year ago and better than the
company planned in its 2010 budget. He added that “it appears”
the Treasury Ministry will sell its stake in Lotos in 2011,
rather than this year as originally planned.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
