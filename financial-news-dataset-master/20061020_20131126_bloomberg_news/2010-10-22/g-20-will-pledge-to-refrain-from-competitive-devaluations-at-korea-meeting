The Group of 20 will today pledge to
refrain from competitive devaluations and commit to market-
determined exchange rates, a G-20 official said, citing a
statement to be released after talks end in South Korea.  The International Monetary Fund will be tasked with
producing a broader report on currency policies and studying
economies with persistant trade imbalances, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
