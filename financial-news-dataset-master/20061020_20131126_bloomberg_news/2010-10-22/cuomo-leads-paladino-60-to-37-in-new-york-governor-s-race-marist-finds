New York  Democrat  Andrew Cuomo  has a
23 percentage-point lead over Republican  Carl Paladino  among
likely voters with 11 days remaining in their race for governor,
a  Marist College poll  reported today.  Cuomo, 52, state attorney general and son of former
Governor  Mario Cuomo , received 60 percent to 37 percent for
Paladino, 64, a Buffalo-based real estate developer running with
Tea Party support, among likely and early voters. A Sept. 24
Marist poll showed Cuomo with a 19 percentage-point lead.  Cuomo gained support after Paladino created controversy in
an angry encounter with a New York Post reporter that was
captured on video, and in statements opposing gay marriage.
“That’s not how God created us,” he said Oct. 10.  “The gap between Cuomo and Paladino has widened as
Paladino is increasingly viewed negatively by New York voters,”
said  Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist College Institute for
Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, New York. “Carl Paladino may
have wanted to run for governor in the worst possible way, and
judging from these numbers, that may be exactly what he has
done.”  The Oct. 18th through 20th telephone survey of 1,014 New
York state voters included 505 likely voters, giving the poll a
4.5 percentage point margin of error, the institute said in a
news release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
