China will crack down on illegal
trading activities in rice futures after prices gained to a
record, the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange said.  The exchange will take measures “to ensure orderly and
smooth operation in rice futures,” the exchange said today in a
statement on its website, without elaborating.  May-delivery rice futures advanced as much as 3.7 percent
to 2,492 yuan ($374) a metric ton on the exchange, the highest
level ever, and closed at 2,479 yuan.  -- Feiwen Rong , Jing Jin. Editors: Richard Dobson, Jake Lloyd-
