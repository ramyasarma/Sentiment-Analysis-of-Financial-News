Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s
largest automaker, plans to form a 500 billion won ($445 million)
venture with  Ziyang Nanjun Automobile Co.  in China next year to
expand its market share in the world’s biggest auto market.  The companies signed an agreement yesterday to form the
partnership to build commercial vehicles, in which each will
have a 50 percent share, Hyundai said in an e-mailed statement
today. The venture will take over Ziyang’s commercial-vehicle
operation, which has annual output capacity of 120,000 vehicles.
It will target 90,000 heavy truck and bus sales in China next
year, rising to 300,000 in 2015, the statement said.  Hyundai, based in Seoul, is entering China’s commercial-
vehicle market as economic growth spurs demand for construction
equipment. Sales of trucks and buses in China is expected to
reach 4.5 million units this year and may total 5.5 million in
2015, led by development in inland regions, Hyundai said.  “Demand for commercial vehicles in China is very strong
because of government-led economic development projects,” said
 Mo Se Joon , a Seoul-based analyst at  Hana Daetoo Securities Co. 
“This move could help Hyundai globalize its commercial-vehicle
business.”  Hyundai Motor  rose  3.4 percent in Seoul trading to close at
168,000 won, the highest level in a week. The stock has advanced
39 percent this year.  “In order to become a true global auto player, entering
China’s commercial vehicle market is an inevitable move for
Hyundai,”  Choi Han Young , vice chairman of the company’s
commercial-vehicle division, said in the statement.  The agreement marks Hyundai’s fourth attempt to penetrate
China’s commercial-vehicle market after a $400 million deal with
 Baotou Bei Ben Heavy-Duty Truck Co.  in 2009, a 2004 agreement
with Jianghuai Automobile Co. and a $1.2 billion deal with
Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. in 2005 fell apart.  To contact the reporter on this story:
