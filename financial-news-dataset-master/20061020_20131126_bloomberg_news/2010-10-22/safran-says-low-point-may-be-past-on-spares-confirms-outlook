Safran SA , which makes commercial
jet engines with General Electric Co., reiterated its 2010
outlook for a higher operating margin and said its engine spares
and maintenance business appears to be improving.  The Paris-based company reported an 8.8 percent increase in
third-quarter sales to 2.59 billion euros ($3.6 billion), and
Safran said revenue grew more than 10 percent at the aircraft
equipment, defense, and security divisions. Sales from aerospace
propulsion declined 1.1 percent to 1.33 billion euros, according
to a release today.  Sales from spare parts for the CFM56 engines that Safran
builds with General Electric to power Airbus SAS A320 and  Boeing
Co . 737 models rose 16 percent, “giving us confidence that the
low point might be behind us,” Chief Executive Officer  Jean- Paul Herteman  said in the statement.  Safran’s spare-engine sales suffered during the recession
as global airlines curtailed growth. As air traffic has begun
rebounding, so has repair and maintenance work on aircraft.  “Based on the performance for the first nine months of the
year and current positive trends in our markets, we confirm our
full-year guidance for 2010 and our renewed confidence in our
outlook for 2011 and beyond,” Safran said in the release.  Safran said on July 28 that margins on recurring operating
profit would widen toward the 8 percent mark from 6.7 percent in
2009, and revenue will be similar to 2009 levels, with free cash
flow representing at least half of recurring operating income.  To contact the report on this story:
