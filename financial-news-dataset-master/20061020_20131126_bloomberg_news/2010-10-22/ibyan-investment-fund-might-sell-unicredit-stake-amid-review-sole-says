The Libyan Investment Authority is
considering the sale of its 2.6 percent stake in  UniCredit SpA ,
daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The sovereign fund is weighing whether to keep the stake
after the bank’s management asked it for further details about
its links to Libya’s central bank, which owns about 5 percent of
UniCredit, according to the Italian newspaper.  UniCredit restricts voting rights above 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
