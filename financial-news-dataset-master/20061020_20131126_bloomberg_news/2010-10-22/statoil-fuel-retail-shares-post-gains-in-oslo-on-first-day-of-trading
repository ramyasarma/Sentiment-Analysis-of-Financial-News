Statoil Fuel & Retail ASA rose 2.6
kroner, or 6.7 percent, to 41.6 kroner at 9:01 a.m. in Oslo on
its first day of trading.  Statoil ASA, Norway’s largest oil and gas company, said
yesterday it will raise as much as 5.4 billion kroner in the
initial public offering for the gas station and fuel unit,
Norway’s biggest share sale in more than four years.  The offering, priced at 39 kroner a share, was “several
times” oversubscribed, the Stavanger-based company said. The
company said it will sell as many as 120 million shares in
Statoil Fuel & Retail and the underwriters will exercise their
option for an additional 18 million.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
