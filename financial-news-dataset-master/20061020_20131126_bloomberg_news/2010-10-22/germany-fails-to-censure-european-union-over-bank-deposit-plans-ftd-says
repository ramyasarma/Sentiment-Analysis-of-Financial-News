The German Parliament’s effort to
censure the European Union over proposed changes to rules
governing guarantees to customer bank deposits has failed,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  Only the parliaments of Sweden and Denmark joined the
Bundestag in registering complaints with Brussels over plans to
force banks to reserve enough capital to pay customers up to
100,000 euros ($139,000) in the event of a bank failure, the
newspaper said, citing a Bundestag document.  The vote of at least 30 percent of national parliaments of
the 27 EU-member countries would have been necessary for the
commission to reassess its plans, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
