European Union governments have
amended planned sanctions against Iran to spare a gas-production
venture led by  BP Plc  in which the Iranian government has a
stake, a person familiar with the EU decision said.  The EU will exempt Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz gas field when
it announces regulations that implement a July decision to
punish Iran’s nuclear program, said the person, who declined to
be named because the decision won’t be published until Oct. 26.
European technology used in the venture will be barred from
export to Iran, the person said.  Iran holds a stake in the venture, a possible source of gas
for the Nabucco pipeline, an EU-backed project designed to
reduce the bloc’s reliance on natural gas from Russia. Norway’s
 Statoil ASA  and Paris-based  Total SA  are also involved in the
project.  EU governments joined the U.S. in July in imposing curbs on
Iran’s energy industries, banks and shipping companies, seeking
to force the clerical regime to halt uranium enrichment and stop
any pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
