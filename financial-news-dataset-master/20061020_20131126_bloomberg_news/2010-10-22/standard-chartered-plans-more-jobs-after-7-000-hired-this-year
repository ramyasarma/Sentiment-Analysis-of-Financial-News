Standard Chartered Plc  has hired
about 7,000 additional employees so far this year and will
continue to create jobs, according to Finance Director  Richard Meddings .  “In 2010 we’ve added 7,000 people to the workforce, the
business has good momentum and we will continue to hire,”
Meddings said in an interview today.  The bank now has a total of more than 85,000 staff, he
said. Standard Chartered has almost doubled its headcount since
2005, when it had about 44,000 employees, data compiled by
Bloomberg  show .  The  company  is raising 3.3 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) in
a rights offering to strengthen capital as the bank expands in
its markets of Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In May, the
company said it would add about 2,000 people in Singapore by
2012 and 2,500 employees in India this year.  The pace of hiring may slow in the fourth quarter as it
“tends to be more difficult” to attract employees expecting to
receive bonuses at other companies, Meddings said.  The new bank tax introduced by Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  “doesn’t have a significant impact on the
group” and is “broadly in line” with the bank’s expectations,
said Meddings. Osborne plans to raise 2.5 billion pounds from a
levy on banks’ balance sheets from Jan. 1.  “As an international bank in over 70 markets it’s really
important there is real global co-ordination of banking taxes
and banking regulation,” said Meddings. If regulation is
“piecemeal on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, then
there’s risk of double levies, there’s a real risk of regulatory
confusion and there’ a risk of the U.K. becoming a less
effective place to locate and operate,” he said.  “We don’t want to move,” Meddings said. “I think it’s
unlikely we will move, but we’ve clearly done a lot of work to
understand what it would mean if we did.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
