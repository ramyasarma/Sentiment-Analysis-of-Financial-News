Kenya’s government raised its
economic growth forecast for this year as investor confidence
rises thanks to a new constitution and the global economic
recovery, President  Mwai Kibaki  said.  The economy will expand 5 percent this year and 6 percent
in 2011, Kibaki said, according to a copy of his speech on the
Nairobi-based  presidency’s website  yesterday. That compares with
forecasts of 4.5 percent and 5.7 percent given by Finance
Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  in his June budget speech.  “The government has developed a strategic economic
framework that promotes productivity” and creates buffers to
protect again economic turbulence, according to the statement.  Appetite for investment in East Africa’s largest economy is
expected to improve after the passage of a new constitution in
August that increased political stability, Kibaki said. Kenya is
recovering from two years of sluggish growth tied to the global
slowdown and two months of deadly ethnic clashes that followed a
disputed election in December 2007.  Growth was 2.6 percent last year and 1.7 percent in 2008,
down from 7.1 percent in 2007.  Kenya is the world’s largest exporter of black tea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
