Ireland had the highest euro-region
budget deficit in 2009 followed by Spain and Portugal as the
recession and bank bailouts crippled their finances.  All 16 euro-region nations reported a shortfall last year,
with Ireland at 14.4 percent of gross domestic product, revised
from 14.3 percent in April, and Spain at 11.1 percent, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today in
its second budget report for 2009. Data for Greece will be
published next month, the statistics office said, when it will
also publish data for the euro area.  European governments are seeking ways to push down their
deficits after the Greek fiscal crisis this year forced leaders
to take emergency steps to restore confidence in the euro.
Finance Ministers agreed on Oct. 19 to toughen sanctions for
breaches of fiscal rules, though stopped short of more automatic
penalties some countries had demanded.  Portugal’s shortfall was at 9.3 percent in 2009, more than
three times the EU’s 3 percent limit of GDP. Luxembourg had the
lowest euro-region shortfall, at 0.7 percent of GDP.  Twenty-four out of 27 EU member states recorded a worsening
of their deficits in 2009 compared with the previous year, while
Estonia and Malta had an improvement, today’s report showed. In
the U.K., where finance minister  George Osborne  published
details of planned spending cuts this week, the deficit was 11.4
percent, up from April’s 11.3 percent estimate.  Eleven EU nations had government debt exceeding the EU’s 60
percent of GDP limit in 2009, with Italy at 116 percent, Belgium
at 96 percent,  France  at 78 percent and Portugal at 76 percent.
 Germany , Europe’s largest economy, had a shortfall of 3 percent
of GDP and state debt at 73 percent.  The statistics office, which in April reported that
Greece’s 2009 deficit was at 13.6 percent of GDP, was initially
scheduled to report figures for all 27 EU member states in
today’s report. The European Commission has said the Greek
figure will be revised higher, without giving details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
