Natural gas futures may fall as
above-normal temperatures lead to rising inventories of the
heating fuel, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Ten of 19 analysts, or 53 percent, forecast that gas
futures will decline on the New York Mercantile Exchange through
Oct. 29. Five, or 26 percent, predicted prices will stay the
same and four said futures will rise. Last week, 50 percent of
participants said gas would fall.  Warmer-than-normal weather is likely along the U.S. East
Coast through Oct. 30, according to Commodity Weather Group in
Bethesda, Maryland. New York may have a high of 70 degrees
Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) on Oct. 26, 10 degrees above normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc . in State College, Pennsylvania.  “Mild temperatures are pressuring the market lower,” said
 Jason Schenker , president of Prestige Economics in Austin,
Texas. “Injections into storage have been quite large and have
continued to surprise to the upside for the past couple of
weeks.”  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Natural gas for November delivery fell 20.3 cents, or 5.7
percent, to $3.332 per million British thermal units this week
on the New York exchange.  Stockpile Gain  Stockpiles rose 93 billion cubic feet to 3.683 trillion
cubic feet in the week ended Oct. 15, the Energy Department said
yesterday. A surplus to the five-year average increased to 8.4
percent from 7.4 percent the previous week. A deficit to year-
earlier supplies narrowed to 1.3 percent from 3.2 percent. The
five-year average gain for the week is 54 billion cubic feet.  U.S. gas inventories will peak at 3.726 trillion cubic feet
by the end of this month, the second-highest level ever for the
start of a heating season, the Energy Department predicted in
its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook  on Oct. 13. Inventories
reached a record 3.837 trillion cubic feet last November.  The department lowered its forecasts for gas prices by 1.5
percent as higher production offsets demand. Benchmark gas
prices at the Henry Hub in Louisiana will average $4.47 per
million British thermal units this year, down from September’s
estimate of $4.54, the department said.  Wholesale natural gas at the Henry Hub fell 27.48 cents, or
7.9 percent, to $3.1856 per million Btu today on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 48 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  4     10      5  To contact the reporter on this story:
