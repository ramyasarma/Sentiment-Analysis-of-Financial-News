Twenty-five U.S. states contributed
less money to their retirement funds in 2009 than actuaries
calculated was needed to support the plans, up from 23 a year
earlier, Loop Capital Markets said in a report.  Twenty states, including the lowest-rated  California  and
Illinois, failed to make adequate payments into their pensions
for teachers and public employees for any of the three years
from 2007 to 2009, the Chicago-based investment bank said today
in a summary of its annual analysis of U.S. retirement funds.  “It’s an area where it’s easy to cut, and you don’t get a
lot of pushback,”  Chris Mier , a Loop strategist, said in a
telephone interview. “A lot of states took advantage of that.”  Persistent underfunding, coupled with investment losses
during the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2009, left 91 of the
145 state retirement funds studied with assets worth less than
the 80 percent of future benefits that actuaries say is
adequate, Loop said.  “As only 24 of 73 pension plans with assets over $1
billion are currently considered funded, it is clear there is a
serious issue that needs to be addressed,” the report said.  Underfunding of pensions has been cited as a reason for
credit downgrades in Illinois, New Jersey and other states this
year. A Bloomberg analysis of state pensions found that funding
levels across the 50 states ranged from 51 percent in Illinois
to 107 percent in New York.  The recession left states facing a total of $110 billion in
revenue shortfalls, according to the Washington-based  Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities .  To contact the reporter on this story:
