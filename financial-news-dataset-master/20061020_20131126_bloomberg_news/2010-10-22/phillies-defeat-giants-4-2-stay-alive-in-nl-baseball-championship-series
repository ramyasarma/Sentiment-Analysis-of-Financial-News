Roy Halladay and the Phillies stayed
alive in the playoffs with a 4-2 win against the San Francisco
Giants that sent the National League Championship Series back to
Philadelphia.  Halladay allowed two runs in six innings, scattering six
hits, as the Phillies pulled within 3-2 in the best-of-seven
series.  Game 6 is set for Oct. 23 at the Phillies’ Citizens Bank
Park, which would host a decisive Game 7 the following day if
necessary.  Tim Lincecum allowed three runs in seven innings for the
Giants, who are trying to end the Phillies’ two-year reign as
National League champions and reach the World Series for the
first time since 2002.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
