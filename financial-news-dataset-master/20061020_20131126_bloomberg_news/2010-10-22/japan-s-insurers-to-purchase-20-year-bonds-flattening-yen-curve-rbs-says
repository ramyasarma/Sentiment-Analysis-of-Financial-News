Japanese life insurers will snap up
government bonds dated 20 years or longer in the fiscal year
ending in March, easing the steepening of the yield curve,
according to RBS Securities Japan Ltd.  Insurers tend to boost purchases of Japanese “super-long”
notes and shift to domestic from foreign debt in the second half
of the business year, said  RuiXue Xu , a strategist in Tokyo at
the unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. Japan’s three
biggest life insurers -- Nippon Life Insurance Co., Dai-ichi
Life Insurance Co. and Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co. -- this
month said they plan to buy Japanese bonds.  “It’s unlikely the yield curve will steepen further,” Xu
said. “It wouldn’t be surprising if relatively cheap super-long
bonds will correct, supported by demand from life insurers.”  Nippon Life , Japan’s largest insurer, said this week it
plans to allocate part of its 400 billion yen ($4.93 billion) in
new investments for the second half into Japanese bonds. Dai-
ichi Life, the nation’s second biggest, said last week it will
mainly invest in Japanese government bonds with at least 20
years to maturity, while smaller rival Meiji Yasuda said Oct. 19
it will increase holdings of Japanese debt by 400 billion yen.  Japan’s top three life insurers hold about 44.3 trillion
yen in domestic debt, according to calculations based on
corporate statements and comments this year.  Japanese insurers’ net purchases of long-term bonds in the
second half were an average 2.3 trillion yen in the fiscal years
2004-2009, compared with an average 1.6 trillion yen in the
first half, according to the  Japan Securities Dealers
Association . Net buying reached a record 1.2 trillion yen last
month as 20-year yields surged to near 2 percent.  Investors see 2 percent and 1.8 percent as key levels for
30- and 20-year yields respectively, and demand has increased
when rates reach approach those figures, Xu said. Thirty-year
bond yields were unchanged at 1.96 percent and 20-year yields
held at 1.77 percent today.  The  difference  in yield on 10- and 20-year bonds widened on
Oct. 19 to 87.8 basis points, the most since March 2008,
according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
