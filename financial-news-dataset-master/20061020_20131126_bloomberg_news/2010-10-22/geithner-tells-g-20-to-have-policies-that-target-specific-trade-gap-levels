U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F.
Geithner told Group of 20 nations they should commit to policies
which reduce external imbalances below a specific share of gross
domestic product.               In a letter to his G-20 counterparts obtained by Bloomberg 
News, Geithner said officials “should commit to undertake 
policies consistent with reducing external imbalances below a 
specified share of GDP over the next few years.”
Authorities should recognize that some commodity-rich nations
should have exceptions, he said. He also urged countries running
large trade surpluses to use fiscal, structural and currencies
to reduce those gaps. He warned countries not to use their
exchange rates to win competitive advatanges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
