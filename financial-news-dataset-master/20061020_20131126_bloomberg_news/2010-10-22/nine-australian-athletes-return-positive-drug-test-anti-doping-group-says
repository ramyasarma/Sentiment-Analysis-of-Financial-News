Nine Australian athletes have
returned positive drug tests for the banned stimulant
methylhexaneamine, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority
said today.  “Methylhexaneamine has been the subject of a number of
recent international doping cases with some athletes involved
reporting that they unknowingly ingested the banned substance
when using supplements or other products,” the authority said
on its website.  It did not name the athletes. Athletes from the
Commonwealth Games, Australian Rules Football and National Rugby
League may have been caught and may face two-year bans, the
Herald Sun newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
