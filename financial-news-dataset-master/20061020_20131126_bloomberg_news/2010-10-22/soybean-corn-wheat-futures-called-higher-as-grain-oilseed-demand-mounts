What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid record Chinese demand for
U.S. supplies, said  Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. Soybean-meal futures
may open 50 cents to $1 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil
is expected to open up 0.25 cent to 0.35 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
increased demand from ethanol manufacturers and livestock
producers amid speculation that adverse weather reduced U.S.
production more than the government projected, Grow said.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on bets that demand for U.S. supplies will
increase after prices approached a two-week low yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
