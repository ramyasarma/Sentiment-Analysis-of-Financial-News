Czech Prime Minister  Petr Necas  said
the government is unlikely to lose if solar power producers that
it plans to tax take the matter to arbitration, Hospodarske
Noviny reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Necas also said the
government will monitor energy production based on burning

experienced with solar power.  The work of the Czech energy regulator will be scrutinized,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
