United Business Media Ltd. , the
publisher of InformationWeek, said nine-month revenue rose 3.9
percent and it is “firmly on track” to meet its full-year
forecasts.  For the nine-months ended Sept. 30, revenue increased to
642.9 million pounds ($1.01 billion) and adjusted operating
profit advanced 8 percent to 109.5 million pounds, UBM said
today in a regulatory statement.  “UBM’s continued solid performance over the first nine
months of the year puts us firmly on track to meet our
expectations for the full-year, although uncertainties over the
wider economic environment remain,”  David Levin , chief
executive officer said in the statement.  UBM is trying to expand its conference, marketing and
business-data units to compensate for a decline in print
advertising. The company said today it completed the $287
million purchase of Canon Communications LLC following
regulatory clearance.  Print revenue fell 15.3 percent to 103.9 million pounds in
the period while revenue from events grew 9.9 percent to 200
million pounds, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
