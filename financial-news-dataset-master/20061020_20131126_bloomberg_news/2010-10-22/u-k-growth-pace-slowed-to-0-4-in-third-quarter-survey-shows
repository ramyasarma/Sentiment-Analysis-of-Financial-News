U.K. economic growth  slowed in the
third quarter to a third of the pace in the previous three
months as consumer spending faltered, a survey of economists
showed.  The economy expanded 0.4 percent in the period, down from
1.2 percent growth in the second quarter, according to the
median forecast in a  Bloomberg News survey  of 35 economists. The
Office for National Statistics will publish the data at 9:30
a.m. on Oct. 26.  The GDP report will matter “quite a lot” for the Bank of
England’s next decision as officials mull whether to add
stimulus, former policy maker  Charles Goodhart  says. Finance
minister  George Osborne  this week gave details of the biggest
fiscal squeeze since World War II, and anticipation of the
announcement may have sapped Britons’ confidence.  “There was so much talk in the run-up to the spending
review that consumers may have become more inclined to delay
purchases until they saw how they were affected,” Scott Corfe,
an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research
in London, said in an interview. “It’s going to be a long and
slow recovery.”  Data for September show  claims for unemployment  benefits
rose the most in eight months, while Lloyds Banking Group Plc’s
Halifax unit said house prices fell the most on record.  The case for adding stimulus is not “cut and dried,”
Goodhart said in an Oct. 18 interview. “It will depend quite a
lot on what the first estimate of third quarter GDP is” and
“on what the reaction to the spending review itself is.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
