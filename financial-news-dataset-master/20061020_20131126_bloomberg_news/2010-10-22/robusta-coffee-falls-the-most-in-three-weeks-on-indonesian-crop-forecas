Cocoa rose to a one-week high on
concern that supplies may be disrupted from Ivory Coast, the
world’s largest producer. Coffee and sugar prices fell.  Ivory Coast elections, scheduled for Oct. 31, have been
repeatedly delayed since 2005 amid voter-registration hurdles.
The West African nation remains divided into a government-
controlled south and rebel-held north following a military
mutiny and civil conflict in 2002.  “An increased chance of some type of disruption in
supply” bolstered prices, said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.  Cocoa for December delivery rose $29, or 1 percent, to
settle at $2,846 a metric ton at 12:03 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Earlier, the price reached $2,878, the highest
level for a most-active contract since Oct. 15. The commodity
gained 1.5 percent this week.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery climbed 23
pounds, or 1.2 percent, to settle at 1,925 pounds ($3,019) a ton
on NYSE Liffe. The price has dropped 14 percent this year.  Hershey Co.  said yesterday that costs for ingredients such
as cocoa, sugar and milk may climb in the fourth quarter and
next year.  Coffee had the biggest drop in almost two weeks as the
dollar’s rebound eroded the appeal of raw materials.  ‘Ripe for Downturn’  The  greenback  headed for a weekly gain against a basket of
major currencies, ending a five-week slump.  “Should the dollar outlook turn more positive, commodities
may be ripe for a downturn,”  Ralph Hawes , a coffee trader at
Sucden Financial Ltd. in London, said in a note.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery fell 2.15
cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $1.9885 a pound in New York,
the biggest drop since Oct. 11.  Yesterday, the price reached a 13-year high amid concern
that adverse weather is reducing crops in Vietnam and Colombia.
This week, the commodity jumped 6.7 percent, the most since mid-
June.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery
dropped $67, or 3.5 percent, to settle at $1,826 a ton today.  Robusta beans, used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly
in Asia and parts of Africa. Arabica coffee is grown mainly in
Latin America and brewed by specialty companies including
Starbucks Corp.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.13 cent, or 0.5
percent, to settle at 28.22 cents a pound in New York. This
week, the price climbed 4.3 percent, the third straight gain.  In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery
dropped $17, or 2.3 percent, to close at $706.90 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
