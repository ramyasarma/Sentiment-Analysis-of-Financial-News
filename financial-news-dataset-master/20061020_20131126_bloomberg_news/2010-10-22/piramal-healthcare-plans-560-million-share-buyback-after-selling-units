Piramal Healthcare Ltd.  plans to
spend 25 billion rupees ($560 million) on a share buyback after
the Indian drugmaker sold its domestic generic-medicine business
to Abbott Laboratories.  Piramal aims to buy back 41.8 million shares at 600 rupees
apiece, a 16 percent premium to the current price, the company
said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange today. The
process may be completed by February, after regulatory approvals,
it said.  The company, based in Mumbai, sold its local formulations
business to Abbott Park, Illinois-based Abbott for $3.7 billion
in May, the second biggest takeover in India’s health-care
industry. Two months later, it sold its laboratory unit for 6
billion rupees to  Super Religare Laboratories Ltd. , controlled
by billionaire brothers Malvinder and Shivinder Singh.  “The board evaluated various alternatives for rewarding
shareholders and concluded that the buyback was the best way,”
 Ajay Piramal , chairman, said in a conference call with analysts
today.  Piramal shares  fell  five percent to 515.55 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close of trading in Mumbai. The stock has gained 38
percent this year. The announcement of the buyback was made
after trading hours.  Piramal posted a net income of 125.4 billion rupees in the
quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with 1.1 billion rupees a year
ago, it said today. The profit included a one-time gain of 162.2
billion rupees from the sale of its businesses, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
