Meikles Ltd. , a Zimbabwean company
with interests in hotel and retail industries, is in advanced
talks with a shareholder of one of the group’s subsidiaries, the
company said.  The shareholder may increase its stake in the subsidiary,
Harare-based Meikles said today in an e-mailed statement,
without identifying the shareholder or subsidiary.  Meikles last week rescinded a 2009 resolution to sell its
stake in Kingdom Financial Holdings Ltd. Shareholders approved a
resolution at an extraordinary meeting to distribute $71
million, or the company’s stake in Kingdom Financial, to
shareholders.  Meikles owns supermarkets, department stores, luxury hotels
in Zimbabwe and South Africa, as well as Zimbabwe’s largest tea
plantations and tea producing factories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
