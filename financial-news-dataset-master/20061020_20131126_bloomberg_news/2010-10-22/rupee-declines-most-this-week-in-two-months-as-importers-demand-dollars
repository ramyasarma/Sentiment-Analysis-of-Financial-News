India’s rupee declined this week by
the most in two months on speculation importers were buying
dollars to meet month-end oil payments and to take advantage of
a slump in gold prices.  India, Asia’s third-biggest economy, meets about three-
quarters of its oil needs from abroad. Demand for gold typically
increases ahead of the Diwali religious festival that starts
early in November.  “Oil companies were buying dollars at every level since
yesterday,” said  Paresh Nayar , the Mumbai-based head of
currency and money markets at FirstRand Ltd. “There could be
buying related to gold because prices have come down.”  The rupee fell 1 percent this week to 44.5275 per dollar as
of 10:49 a.m. in Mumbai, the biggest weekly drop since Aug. 13,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 44.5737
today, the weakest level since Oct. 12.  India’s economy expanded 8.8 percent last quarter from a
year earlier, the fastest pace since 2007.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.09 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 44.97
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
