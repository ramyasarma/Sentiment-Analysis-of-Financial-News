Eni SpA, Italy’s biggest oil
company, plans to shut units at its Gela refinery in Sicily from
March to April next year for maintenance, a company official
said in an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News.  The official, who declined to be named in line with company
policy, couldn’t say how long the works would last or which
units were affected by the so-called turnaround. The refinery
has the capacity to process 100,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
