Mexico’s peso gained for the seventh
week in eight as the government raised its growth forecast and
economic data in the U.S., the nation’s largest trading partner,
signaled the recovery will continue next year.  The peso gained this week 0.8 percent to 12.3372 per
dollar at 5 p.m. New York time, from 12.4343 on Oct. 15.
The currency rose 0.4 percent today, and has climbed
6.1 percent this year.  “The news has improved on the margin, it didn’t get any
worse,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , a currency strategist at
RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut. “Mexico’s peso
will take off when the U.S. starts to recover.”  Mexico’s economy may grow 4.8 percent this year, Finance
Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said yesterday. The previous forecast
had been for a gain of 4.5 percent.  Initial jobless claims in the U.S. dropped 23,000 to
452,000 in the week ending Oct. 16, the Labor Department said
yesterday. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s general economic
index rose to 1 from minus 0.7 in September, signaling growth.
The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.37 percent today,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price fell 0.23 centavo to
133.73 centavos per peso.  The unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent in September,
above the median forecast of 5.35 percent in a Bloomberg survey,
the national statistics agency said today.  Consumer prices increased 0.48 percent in the first half of
October from last month, the central bank said today on its
website. Economists expected an increase of 0.4 percent,
according to the median estimates of analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Annual inflation quickened to 3.89 percent in the first
half of the month, below the central bank’s 4.75 percent to 5.25
percent range for the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
