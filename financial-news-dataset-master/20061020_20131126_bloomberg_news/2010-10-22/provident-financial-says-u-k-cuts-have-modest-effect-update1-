Provident Financial Plc,  the U.K.’s
biggest subprime lender, said the government’s cuts in welfare
spending will have a “modest” impact on earnings and
impairments because its consumer loans are short term.  “We expect the direct impact of the government’s spending
review on the group’s customer base to be modest, but continued
tight underwriting and close attention to markets and costs will
remain,” Chief Executive Officer  Peter Crook  said today in the
firm’s third-quarter interim management statement.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  announced plans
this week to shrink welfare payments by 11 billion pounds ($17
billion), an overall cut of about 8 percent in the bill for
unemployment assistance, housing-rental subsidies, disability
payments and pensions. Provident typically lends between 300
pounds and 500 pounds to people who have been refused credit by
larger banks such as  Lloyds Banking Group Plc  and Barclays Plc.  Provident maintained its growth rate of between 4 percent
to 5 percent in its Home Credit unit in the third quarter,
though this may moderate during the rest of the year, the
Bradford, England-based company said.  Provident gained 4.5 percent to 808 pence at the close of
London trading, the most in eight months, for a rise of 0.3
percent this week. The lender dropped 3.3 percent yesterday
after  Robin Savage , an analyst at Collins Stewart Plc, said
welfare cuts would hurt Provident Financial’s clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
