Steven Jacobs , the former chief
executive of  Sands China Ltd. , sued Las Vegas Sands Corp. and
its Hong Kong-listed casino operator, claiming they breached his
employment contract.  Jacobs, fired by Sands China’s board on July 23 for reasons
it didn’t disclose, filed his complaint in a court in Clark
County, Nevada, according to the court’s  website . The complaint
wasn’t available.  “We deny the allegations,” Jacqueline Wu, a spokeswoman
for Sands China, said today.  Billionaire  Sheldon Adelson  is the chairman and chief
executive officer of Las Vegas Sands, the world’s largest casino
by market capitalization. Company spokesman  Ron Reese  said in
July that the dismissal “is not about any dispute between Mr.
Adelson and Mr. Jacobs.”  Jacobs was hired in 2009 as president of Las Vegas Sands’
Macau operations and was named chief executive in August 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
