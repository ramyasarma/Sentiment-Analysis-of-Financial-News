Former Russian Prime Minister
 Mikhail Kasyanov  said he’s concerned that the planned sale of
stakes in state-controlled companies will be undermined by a
lack transparency.  Kasyanov, who served as prime minister from 2000-2004
during  Vladimir Putin ’s presidency and is part of a pro-
democracy opposition group, said the secrecy of the process
casts doubt on the credibility of the offerings.  “I have always been in support of privatization, but having
in mind that this government is not a transparent one, this
privatization is going to be an imitation of the real process,”
he said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York last
night. “It is not going to be done in a clear and transparent
manner. The revenue is going to finance the budget deficit, but
prices will raise a lot of questions.”  Russia’s government unveiled plans this week to sell stakes
in the nation’s two largest lenders. The state may give up
control of VTB Group within three years and plans to reduce its
OAO Sberbank holding by 2014, First Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Shuvalov  said Oct. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
