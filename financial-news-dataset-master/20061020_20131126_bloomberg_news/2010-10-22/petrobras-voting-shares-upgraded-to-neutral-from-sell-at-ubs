Petroleo Brasileiro SA ’s  voting
shares  were upgraded to “neutral” from “sell” at UBS AG,
which estimates a 15 percent  total return  on the stock.  The stock’s  decline  in the past three months in U.S. dollar
terms compared with an increase in Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa
index “warrants an upgrade,”  Lilyanna Yang , an analyst at UBS
in New York, wrote in a report published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
