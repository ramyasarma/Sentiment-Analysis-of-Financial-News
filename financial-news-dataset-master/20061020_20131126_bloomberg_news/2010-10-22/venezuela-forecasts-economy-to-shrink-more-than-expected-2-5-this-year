Venezuela’s economy will contract
2.5 percent this year, contradicting an earlier government
forecast for it to grow, because of the global economic crisis,
according to the 2011 budget proposal.  Venezuela’s oil industry will shrink 1.4 percent and the
non-oil economy will decline 2.6 percent in 2010, according to
the budget plan submitted by Finance Minister  Jorge Giordani  to
the National Assembly yesterday. The government’s prior
forecast, made in March, predicted gross domestic product would
rise 0.5 percent this year.  “The effects of the various crises were concentrated in
the first half of 2010 and will continue for several quarters
with smaller declines,” the document said.  Giordani said yesterday that GDP was recovering after
hitting “bottom” last year when it contracted 3.3 percent. The
economy, which has fallen for  five consecutive quarters , remains
in recession even as the rest of the region returns to growth.  Central Bank President  Nelson Merentes  said yesterday that
the economy may post growth in the fourth quarter. A drop in
foreign investment due to nationalizations and lower oil prices
caused the economy to shrink 3.5 percent in the first half of
2010.  The economy will grow 2 percent in 2011, as the Western
Hemisphere’s highest inflation rate slows, Giordani said. The
economy should grow 2.4 percent in 2012, according to the
document.  The 2011 budget proposal calls for 204.2 billion bolivars
($47.5 billion) of spending, a 28 percent increase from 2010.
Consumer prices may rise 23 percent to 25 percent next year.  Venezuela is South America’s only economy forecast by the
International Monetary Fund to experience negative growth this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
