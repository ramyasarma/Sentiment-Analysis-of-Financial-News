European stocks erased earlier
losses, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index close to a six-month
high, as gains by Ericsson AB and Valeo SA offset declines by
Alfa Laval AB and BioMerieux SA. U.S. futures and Asian shares
advanced.  The benchmark Stoxx 600 was little changed at 267.57 at
12:49 p.m. in London, after falling as much as 0.4 percent
earlier today. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring in December rose 0.3 percent, while the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index also gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
