Hungary may soon be ready to discuss
reducing its bank tax, the highest in Europe, said  Willibald Cernko , chief executive officer of  UniCredit  Bank Austria AG,
one of the biggest lenders in emerging Europe.  Hungary imposed a three-year levy on the financial industry
aimed at raising 182 billion-forint ($920 million) in 2010 to
cut the budget deficit. UniCredit’s Hungarian unit will pay as
much as 28 million euros this year, Cernko said. The European
Central Bank and International Monetary Fund have criticized the
levy, saying it is too large and may curtail lending.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government will have to
listen too demands from international banks as the government
seeks to attract foreign investors and institutions to prop up
the economy in coming years, Cernko told journalists during a
conference in Vienna.  Orban “already scored the political success,” Cernko
said. “The longer the economic catch-up process takes, the more
he will be dependent on foreign capital inflows.” Investors as
well as institutions like IMF and EU “will all demand a
reduction,” he said.  Cernko’s  Bank Austria  owns most of UniCredit’s emerging
European assets. Its UniCredit Bank Hungary Zrt. unit is the
country’s seventh-biggest lender by assets, behind market leader
OTP Bank Nyrt., based in Budapest. Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Erste
Group Bank AG and Raiffeisen Bank International AG are all major
lenders in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
