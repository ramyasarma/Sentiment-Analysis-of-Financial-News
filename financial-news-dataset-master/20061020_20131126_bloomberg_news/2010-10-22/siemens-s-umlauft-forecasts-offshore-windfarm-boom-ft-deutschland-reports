Siemens AG  expects Europe to add
70,000 megawatt in production capacity from offshore windfarms
within the next 10 to 15 years,  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported today, citing an interview with Rene Umlauft, head of
the company’s renewable energy unit.  Umlauft expects installation costs, which average between
1.3 million euros ($1.8 million) and 1.5 million euros per
megawatt, to decline 20 percent in the next three to four years,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
