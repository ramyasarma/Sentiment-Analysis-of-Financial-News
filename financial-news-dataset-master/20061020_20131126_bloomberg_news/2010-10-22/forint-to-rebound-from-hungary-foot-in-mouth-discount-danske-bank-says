The forint may gain to levels last
seen in April as investors start to “ignore the occasional
slip-ups” in the Hungarian government’s rhetoric that have
weighed the currency with a “foot-in-mouth” discount,  Danske
Bank A/S  said.  The currency will likely strengthen to around 265 per euro
in three months from 275.26 at yesterday’s close, analysts led
by Copenhagen-based  Lars Christensen  at Danske Bank wrote in a
report to clients today.  “The forint is today around 5 percent weaker than it would
have been had it not been for ‘misspeak,’ but we also believe
that such a discount is not long lasting and it could therefore
be time to simply ignore the ‘political noise’ coming out of
Budapest,” the analysts wrote. “We also expect the forint to
outperform its central and eastern European peers in the coming
three months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
