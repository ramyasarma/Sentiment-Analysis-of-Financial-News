Wipro Ltd ., India’s third-largest
software exporter, posted second-quarter profit that lagged
behind analyst estimates as the stronger rupee cuts profit
margins of exporters.  Net income  rose 9.4 percent to 12.8 billion rupees ($289
million) in the three months ended in September, from 11.7
billion rupees a year earlier, Bangalore-based Wipro said today.
That compared with the 13.4 billion rupee average of 34 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company reported earnings
according to International Financial Reporting Standards.  Wipro fell in Mumbai trading. Indian software exporters
face shrinking profit margins as a 3.6 percent appreciation of
the rupee against the dollar in the last quarter cuts the
repatriated value of sales overseas. Wipro joins International
Business Machines Corp., the world’s largest computer-services
provider, in signaling that customers may be hesitant to sign
long-term outsourcing contracts after the global recession.  “I’m concerned about the competitive intensity,” said
 Girish Pai , an analyst at Centrum Broking Pvt. in Mumbai, who
has a “sell” rating for Wipro’s shares. “Demand growth has
been strong, but vendors have still not been able to raise
prices.”  Wipro dropped 2.7 percent to 457.70 rupees as of
9:25 a.m. in Mumbai trading, compared with a 0.4 percent
advance by the benchmark Sensitive Index, or Sensex. The
stock has advanced 12 percent in the last year, outperforming
the Sensex’s 16 percent rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
