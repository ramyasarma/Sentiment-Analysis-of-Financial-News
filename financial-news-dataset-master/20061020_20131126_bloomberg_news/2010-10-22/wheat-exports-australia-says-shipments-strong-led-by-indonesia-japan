Australia’s wheat shipments
“continue to be strong” amid strength in the local currency
and uncertainty around world prices, Wheat Exports Australia
said in a report on its website today.  More than 10.4 million metric tons of wheat was shipped in
bulk to 36 different countries by 18 accredited exporters, in
the 11 months to the end of August, the Canberra-based
government agency said. That compares with 11.6 million tons at
the same time in the previous marketing year, it said. Indonesia
was the largest buyer of bulk wheat, followed by Japan, South
Korea, Vietnam and Yemen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
