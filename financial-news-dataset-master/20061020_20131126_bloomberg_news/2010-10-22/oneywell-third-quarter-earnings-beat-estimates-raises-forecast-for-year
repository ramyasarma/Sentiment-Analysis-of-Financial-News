Honeywell International Inc. , the
maker of car turbochargers and aircraft parts, boosted its
full-year forecast after third-quarter profit topped estimates.  Full-year profit will be as much as $2.52 a share, the
Morris Township, New Jersey-based company said today in a
statement, up from a July  projection  of at most $2.50 a share.  Honeywell said sales at all divisions rose on a year-over-
year basis, with industrial growth pushing up revenue at the
 Automation and Controls  division, the company’s largest. Demand
climbed at the Aerospace unit, as airlines increase profits and
demand rises for aftermarket parts.  “The next potentially strong earnings lever is the
recovery we expect to see in the commercial aerospace
aftermarket” beginning with spare parts in the second half of
2010, and possibly followed by repairs and overhauls,  Shannon O’Callaghan , an analyst with Nomura Equity Research in New York
who recommends buying the stock, wrote in a note this month.  Net income declined 18 percent to $499 million, or 64 cents
a share, from $608 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier,
Honeywell said in the statement.  Revenue  climbed 9 percent to
$8.39 billion.  Analysts, on average,  projected  profit of 62 cents, on
revenue of $8.22 billion.  Honeywell’s pension expenses have hurt earnings because the
company’s accounting methods recognize losses quicker than those
of other industrial companies.  Honeywell rose 26 cents to $46.67 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares climbed 19 percent
this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
