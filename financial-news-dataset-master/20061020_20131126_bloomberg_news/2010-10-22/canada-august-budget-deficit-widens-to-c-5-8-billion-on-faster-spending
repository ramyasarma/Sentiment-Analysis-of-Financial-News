Canada’s budget deficit widened in
August as program spending, including infrastructure projects
and payments to aboriginal groups, rose faster than revenue.  Canada’s deficit was C$5.81 billion ($5.7 billion) in
August, up from C$5.34 billion during the same month last year,
according to a statement today from the finance department. For
the fiscal year that began in April through August, the deficit
narrowed to C$13.5 billion from C$23.7 billion.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said Oct. 12 the country will
become the first in the Group of Seven to balance its budget by
2015. This year, the deficit will narrow to C$45.4 billion from
a record C$55.6 billion, according to that budget update.  Program spending rose 14.2 percent in August from a year
earlier to C$20.5 billion and fell 4.3 percent to C$93.6 billion
in the April-August period.  Revenue rose 12.5 percent to C$17.2 billion in August from
a year earlier. It rose 6.7 percent in the five-month period to
C$92.8 billion.  Public debt charges fell 6.1 percent to C$2.5 billion in
August from a year earlier. For the five-month period, they fell
0.7 percent to C$12.7 billion, the report also showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
