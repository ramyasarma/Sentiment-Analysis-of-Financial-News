India’s stocks fluctuated.  Wipro
Ltd.  dropped as earnings fell short of analyst estimates, while
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.  surged after profit gained.  Wipro, the third-largest software exporter, plunged the
most in nine months after posting a 12.8 billion rupee ($289
million) profit, compared with the 13.4 billion rupee average of
34 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Tata Consultancy,
the largest software services exporter, soared to a record after
second-quarter earnings surged.  “Earnings are one of the strongest market drivers,”
said Apurva Shah, head of research at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt.
in Mumbai. “Wipro earnings were disappointing, Tata
Consultancy’s numbers were very strong. In terms of value, it is
fabulous.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
rose 6.20, or less than 0.1 percent, to 20,266.78 at 10:18 a.m.
in Mumbai, after swinging between gains and losses at least six
times. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
dropped 0.1 percent to 6,097.25. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.1
percent to 2,578.84.  Wipro declined 3.4 percent to 454.05 rupees. Its second-
quarter profit lagged behind estimates as the stronger rupee cut
profit margins of exporters.  Ambuja Cements Ltd.  slumped 1.3 percent to 140.4 rupees
after the unit of Holcim Ltd., the world’s second-largest cement
maker, said third-quarter profit sank 52 percent to
1.52 billion rupees.  Tata Consultancy jumped 4.3 percent to 1,028.2 rupees,
heading for its highest close since the shares were listed in
August 2004. Net income rose 32 percent to 21.7 billion rupees
($490 million) in the three months ended September.  Overseas  investors  bought a net  8.11 billion rupees  of
Indian equities on Oct. 20, extending this year’s record inflows
to 1.09 trillion rupees, according to the nation’s market
regulator.  Global funds have been net buyers of stocks for 36 trading
days, the longest run of inflows in more than five years since
the 40-day period ended Aug. 9, 2005, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
