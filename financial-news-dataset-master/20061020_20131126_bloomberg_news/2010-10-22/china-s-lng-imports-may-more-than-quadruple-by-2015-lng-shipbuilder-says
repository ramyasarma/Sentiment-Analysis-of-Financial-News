China may more than quadruple
imports of liquefied natural gas in the six years through 2015
because of increased consumption of the cleaner-burning fuel,
said an official from the nation’s only builder of LNG vessels.  Imports may rise to 25 million metric tons a year as the
nation’s energy demand is climbing, Shen Ning, vice director of
business and marketing at  Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding (Group)
Co. , said in an interview in Shanghai yesterday. Hudong-Zhonghua
Shipbuilding has built all of the nation’s LNG tankers.  China’s LNG imports surged 66 percent to 5.5 million tons
last year from a year earlier. The world’s biggest polluting
nation wants to triple the use of gas to about 10 percent of
energy consumption by 2020.  The shipbuilding company, a unit of China State
Shipbuilding Corp., has delivered five LNG vessels to transport
the fuel to domestic terminals and is building another 145,000
cubic-meter LNG tanker, Shen said.  The company is developing its third shipyard on Changxing
Island in Shanghai, which will more than double its LNG vessel
building capacity from three vessels a year currently, he said.
The facility will be completed in 2012, he said.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editors:  Jane Lee ,  Ryan Woo .  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
