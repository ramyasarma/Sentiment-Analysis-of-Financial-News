Bridgestone Corp. , the world’s
largest tiremaker, said it may boost sales to 3.5 trillion yen
($43.2 billion) by 2012 as demand grows in markets including
China, India and Brazil.  Sales will increase from 2.9 trillion yen in 2010, the
company estimated, while  operating profit  may rise to 280
billion yen. Tire sales are expected to grow 40 percent by 2015
from 2009, while industrywide demand may rise 15 percent, the
Tokyo-based company said today in a statement.  Surging vehicle demand in emerging markets is helping
Bridgestone sell more tires for passenger cars and trucks.
Bridgestone expects its tire sales in China to rise 140 percent
from 2009 levels by 2015, with gains of 80 percent in India and
60 percent in Brazil.  Bridgestone  rose 1.9 percent to close at 1,455 yen in Tokyo
trading before the announcement, trimming its decline this year
to 11 percent.  The company is basing its five-year plan on exchange rates
of 95 yen to the U.S. dollar and 120 yen to the euro. A 1-yen
gain in the Japanese currency against the dollar may cut
operating profit by 3.5 billion yen in 2012, while a 1-yen gain
against the euro may reduce it by 1 billion yen, Chief Financial
Officer Akihiro Eto told reporters today in Tokyo.  Capital Spending  The yen traded at 81.07 against the U.S. dollar as of 4:11
p.m. in Tokyo. A stronger yen cuts the value of Bridgestone’s
overseas earnings when converted back into the Japanese currency.  Eto also said the company may consider raising prices as
the cost of raw materials rise.  Bridgestone will invest 24 billion yen to increase
production capacity for large tires and steel cords for vehicles
used by construction and mining companies, the company said
separately today.  The expansion, at plants in Fukuoka and Saga prefectures in
southern Japan, is to be completed in the second half of 2013,
Bridgestone said in a statement. The company will raise daily
tire production at a plant in Kitakyushu City, Fukuoka, to 130
tons from 30 tons.  Bridgestone will spend 22 billion yen on the tire plant
expansion and 2 billion yen on the steel-cord factory, the
company said. The tiremaker said it plans 220 billion yen to 270
billion yen in annual capital expenditures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
