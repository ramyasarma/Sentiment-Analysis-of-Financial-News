Gold futures fell, capping the
biggest weekly slide since early July, as the dollar rebounded,
eroding demand for the precious metal as an alternative
investment.  The  greenback  headed for a weekly gain against a basket of
six currencies, snapping a five-week slump. Gold has dropped 4.5
percent since reaching a record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14.  “Gold is in the midst of a long-awaited correction,” said
 Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services
in Chicago. “From a technical point, there’s really nothing
between here and $1,260 for gold to hang its hat on.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 50 cents to settle
at $1,325.10 an ounce at 2 p.m. on the Comex in New York. This
week, the most-active contract dropped 3.4 percent, the most
since July 2. Earlier, the metal touched $1,315.60, a two-week
low.  Yesterday,  holdings  in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded fund backed by the metal, decreased 0.91 metric
ton to 1,298.27 tons, the fifth straight decline.  Before this week, gold reached an all-time high 16 times
since Sept. 14 as the dollar declined. The metal has gained 21
percent this year.  Fed Meeting  Gold may fluctuate until Federal Reserve policy makers meet
in two weeks to decide whether to increase stimulus measures to
spur U.S. growth.  The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero
percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and purchased
Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as part of its so-
called quantitative- easing program to help stimulate the
economy.  “Gold prices could still rally if insufficient QE measures
simply introduced new downside risks to U.S. growth,” analysts
at Deutsche Bank AG said in a report. “In the event of a more
generous package of QE measures, this would encourage a more-
rapid depreciation of the dollar and hence gold-price
strength.”  Gold is not in a “bubble” until prices top $2,000,
Deutsche Bank said.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 2.1 cents to
$23.118 an ounce on the Comex. This week, the price dropped 4.8
percent, halting a five-week rally.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $1.70, or 0.1
percent, to $1,675.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The metal declined 1.2 percent this week.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose $4.80, or 0.8
percent, to $591.10 an ounce. This week, the metal climbed 0.3
percent, the sixth straight advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
