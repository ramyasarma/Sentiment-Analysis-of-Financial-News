India’s  10-year bonds  fell, pushing
yields to a two-year high, on concern an auction of notes by the
finance ministry today and sales by state governments next week
will further reduce the availability of cash to buy debt.  Banks  borrowed  an average 485 billion rupees ($10.9 billion)
from the central bank’s repurchase auction window each day this
month, compared with 251 billion rupees a day in September.
India sold 110 billion rupees of bonds due in 2017, 2022 and
2040 today. Investors will make the payment on Oct. 25. Funds in
the banking system have dropped after Coal India Ltd.’s initial
public offering that ended yesterday, the country’s biggest
share sale to date.  “Liquidity is the main concern and that is pushing up
yields,” said  Debendra Kumar Dash , a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “The auctions will further
drain cash.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 rose seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, this week to 8.14
percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The price dropped 47 paise per
100 rupee face amount to 97.77.  India plans to buy back 120 billion rupees of bonds that
are due to mature this year and next on Oct. 25, the central
bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The move is part
of plans to repurchase a combined 285.5 billion rupees of debt
maturing in 2010 and 2011.  Ten Indian states will sell 77.3 billion rupees of 10-year
notes on Oct. 26. The positive effect of the buyback has been
negated by the state bond auctions, said Dash.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates, fell four basis points this week
to 6.64 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
