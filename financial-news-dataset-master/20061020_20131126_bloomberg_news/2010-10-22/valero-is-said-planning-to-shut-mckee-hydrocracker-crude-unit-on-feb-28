Valero Energy Corp . will shut a
hydrocracker and the larger of two crude units at its  McKee
refinery  in Sunray, Texas, on Feb. 28 for planned repairs, said
two people familiar with refinery operations.  The work on the production units is routine maintenance,
said the people, who declined to be identified because they
aren’t authorized to speak for the refinery.  Bill Day , a spokesman for the San Antonio-based refiner,
said the company will release a refinery maintenance schedule on
Oct. 26 when Valero reports third-quarter earnings.  The refinery in the Texas Panhandle receives feedstock from
northern Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and eastern Colorado. It
obtains crude from storage in Cushing, Oklahoma, through third-
party pipelines, according to the Valero website.  The refinery has a capacity of 170,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
