The European Central Bank said that
the euro region’s small- and medium-sized companies found it
easier to access bank loans in the six months through September
as the 16-member  economy  gathered strength.  The share of so-called SMEs reporting a worsening access to
bank loans fell to 24 percent from 42 percent in the previous
six months, the Frankfurt-based ECB said in a report on its
website today, citing a survey of 5,312 firms conducted Aug. 27
to Sept. 22. Twelve percent of companies reported an improvement
in access to external financing, up from 10 percent.  “The factors which have an impact on the availability of
external financing have improved, especially those concerning
the economic outlook,” the ECB said. Companies maintained their
sales assessment, which “bodes well for the ongoing revival of
economic activity suggested by industrial production and real
gross-domestic-product indicators.”  Twenty-one percent of SMEs surveyed reported a drop in
profit during the period, which “could be linked to a
significant increase in production costs” in the first half of
2010, the ECB said in the report.  Among large companies, which were also covered by the
survey as a reference group, access to bank loans remained
“stable” over the period with the overall financial situation
showing “clear signs of improvement,” the report said. Net
increases in profit “appear to have resumed” among large firms
in the first half of 2010, according to the ECB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
