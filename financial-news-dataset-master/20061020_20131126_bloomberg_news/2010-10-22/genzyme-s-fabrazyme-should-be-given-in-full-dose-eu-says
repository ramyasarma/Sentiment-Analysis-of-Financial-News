Genzyme Corp .’s Fabrazyme drug for
Fabry disease should be given in a full dose after patients
receiving a lesser amount reported side effects, the European
Medicines Agency said.  The agency said today in an e-mailed  statement  that it
remains concerned about a shortage of Fabrazyme after
disruptions at Genzyme’s Allston Landing factory in Boston.
Fabry patients also can be given a full dose of Shire Plc’s
Replagal, the agency said.  Genzyme, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said two days
ago that it’s made progress in fixing the manufacturing problems
and it will return to full worldwide supply of Fabrazyme in the
first half of next year.  The world’s largest maker of treatments for rare genetic
disorders is trying to fend off a hostile takeover bid by
 Sanofi-Aventis SA . Genzyme has scheduled an investor meeting for
today in New York to discuss Sanofi’s $69-a-share bid for the
company.  Genzyme previously rejected Paris-based Sanofi’s $18.5
billion bid, saying it undervalued the company’s pipeline and
revenue potential once it resumes full production of Fabrazyme
and Cerezyme, its top-selling medicines. Genzyme said it will
return to full supply of Cerezyme in the fourth quarter of this
year.  European regulators recommended a smaller Fabrazyme dose
for some patients last year after a virus outbreak forced
Genzyme to shut the factory that produces the drug, causing the
shortage.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
