OAO Gazprom , the world’s biggest
natural-gas producer, agreed to carry out a feasibility study of
the Bulgarian segment of the planned  South Stream  pipeline, the
company said.  The company signed the agreement with Bulgaria’s energy
holding and pledged to carry out the feasibility study quickly,
it said in an e-mailed statement today.  “In the first half of 2011 we will be able to make a
decision about the optimal route of the pipeline in Europe,
taking all the options into account,” Chief Executive Officer
 Alexei Miller  said in the statement.  Gazprom plans to build the pipeline to supply eastern,
central and southern Europe, bypassing transit states such as
Ukraine. The construction is planned to start in 2013 with the
first gas deliveries at the end of 2015.  Romania signed an accord with Gazprom earlier this month
about the possible construction of South Stream across its
territory. Gazprom hasn’t made a final decision on the route.  To contact the reporter on this story:
