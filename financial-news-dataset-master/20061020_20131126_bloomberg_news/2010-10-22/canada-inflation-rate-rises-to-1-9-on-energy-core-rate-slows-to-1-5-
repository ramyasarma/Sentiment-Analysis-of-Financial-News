Canada’s annual  inflation rate 
quickened in September to the fastest pace since January on
energy and shelter costs.  The  consumer price index  rose 1.9 percent, after a 1.7
percent gain in August, Statistics Canada said today. The core
rate that  excludes eight volatile items  such as gasoline slowed
to 1.5 percent from 1.6 percent, the slowest pace since
December. Economists forecast the inflation rate would be 1.9
percent and the core rate 1.6 percent, according to the median
of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said Oct. 20 that core
inflation, which he uses as a guide to underlying price trends,
will remain below 2 percent until the fourth quarter of 2012 on
slower consumer spending and global growth. The bank kept its
key lending rate at 1 percent this week and its forecast
anticipated a “gradual” reduction in monetary stimulus because
of “considerable slack” in the economy.  “Overall it really highlights the fact that core inflation
is really quite tame in Canada,” said  Robert Kavcic , a Bank of
Montreal economist in Toronto. “It confirms what we’re
thinking; they are going to be on hold well into 2011.”  The Canadian dollar advanced to C$1.0255 per U.S. dollar at
8:10 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0267 yesterday. One
Canadian dollar buys 97.51 U.S. cents.  Energy Rises  Energy price gains  accelerated to 5.6 percent in September
from a year earlier, versus a 5 percent gain the previous month,
Statistics Canada said. Shelter costs advanced 2.5 percent and
passenger vehicle prices rose 5 percent as manufacturers curbed
discounts, the report said.  The Bank of Canada said this week that sales tax increases
in Ontario, British Columbia and Nova Scotia will quicken
inflation by 0.7 percentage point from July to June 2011.  The bank predicted inflation would average 1.8 percent in
the third quarter and 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter, and the
core rate would be 1.6 percent in both periods.  On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices rose 0.2
percent in September after a 0.1 percent decline the previous
month. The core rate rose 0.2 percent in September.  Economists predicted that monthly prices would rise 0.1
percent, and the core rate would be 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
