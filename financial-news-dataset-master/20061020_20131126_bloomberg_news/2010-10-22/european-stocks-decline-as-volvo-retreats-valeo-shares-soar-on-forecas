European stocks declined as a drop
in Volvo AB overshadowed a rally in shares of Valeo SA. U.S.
futures were little changed and Asian shares increased.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.3 percent to
266.81 at 8:17 a.m. in London, as 17 out of 19 industry groups
declined.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December were unchanged, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
gained 0.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
