The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 3 basis
points to 463, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 8 a.m. in
London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals a deterioration in
the perception of credit quality.  The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1.5 basis points to 100.25. The
cost of protecting bank bonds from default also increased, with
the Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt of
25 banks and insurers up 2.5 at 126 and the subordinated index 5
higher at 181.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
