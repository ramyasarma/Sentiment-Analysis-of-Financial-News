Honeywell International Inc. , the
maker of turbochargers and plane parts, amended its U.S. retiree
medical plan during the third quarter to no longer offer group
coverage to some retirees who are older than 65.  The change reduced the post-retirement benefit obligation
by $137 million, Morris Township, New Jersey-based Honeywell
said today in a regulatory filing.  “The independent market offers better and more cost-
effective options than Honeywell can provide,”  Rob Ferris , a
company spokesman, said today in an e-mail. “We’re providing
advisory services to help our retirees select and enroll into
this new coverage to ensure a smooth transition.”  Beginning Jan. 1, 2011, Honeywell will transition some post-
age-65 retirees to an individual market plan from company
coverage, Honeywell said in an e-mail. Affected retirees must
enroll in a new individual plan to have Medicare supplemental
coverage after Dec. 31, 2010.  Honeywell didn’t say in the filing or e-mail whether the
change is tied to the health-care overhaul signed by U.S.
President Barack Obama in March. Honeywell also didn’t specify
how many retirees would be affected.  Honeywell climbed 34 cents to $47.01 at 1:44 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite  trading  after boosting its full-
year profit forecast and predicting that in 2011, sales may grow
5 percent or more.  To contact the reporter on this story:
