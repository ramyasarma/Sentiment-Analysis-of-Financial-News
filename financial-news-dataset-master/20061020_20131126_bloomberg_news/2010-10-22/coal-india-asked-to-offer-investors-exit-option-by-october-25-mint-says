India’s stock market regulator asked
Coal India Ltd. to offer all investors an exit option by Oct. 25
because the miner’s profit and loss account in the initial
share-sale document contained errors, Mint reported, citing
Disinvestment Secretary Sumit Bose.  The profit and loss statement showed that figures for
accretion in stock and that of other income had been swapped,
according to the report. The mistake was in the standalone
statement and occurred because the documents were printed in a
hurry, Mint cited A.K. Sinha, Coal India’s director of finance,
as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
