Investec Plc , the South African
private bank, said it priced 128 million pounds ($200 million)
of bonds backed by U.K. non-conforming mortgages in the first
public sale of the securities since 2007.  The Class A1 notes were priced to yield 325 basis points
more than the three-month London interbank offered rate,
Investec said in a statement. The spread steps up to 475 basis
points if the securities aren’t refinanced in December 2018.  Investec’s bonds pool loans made by its London-based
Kensington Group Plc mortgage unit, Bank of America Corp.’s
Mortgages Plc and GMAC RFC, the former financing unit of General
Motors Co., according to the statement. Orders for the notes
exceeded the amount available by 1.9 times.  The bonds were issued through Residential Mortgage
Securities 25 Plc. The transaction will be the first
securitization of non-conforming home loans since Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. sold 730 million pounds of bonds from its
Eurosail-UK 2007-4BL issuance program in August 2007, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
