BioMerieux SA cut its full-year
sales growth target for the second time in three months, citing
a difficult healthcare environment in western Europe and North
America.  Full-year like-for-like sales will rise 4.5 percent, the
company said in a Business Wire statement. On July 22 BioMerieux
cut the target to 6 percent from a previous prediction of about
7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
