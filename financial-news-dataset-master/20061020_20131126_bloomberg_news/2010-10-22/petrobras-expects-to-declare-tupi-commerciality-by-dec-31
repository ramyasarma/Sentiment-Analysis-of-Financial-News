Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, said it is on target to declare
the commerciality of its Tupi field by Dec. 31 after finding
more signs of oil at a new well.  Petrobras said a well drilled in the southern portion of
the Tupi area found signs of light oil and gas and “reduces
uncertainties” about the amount of reserves, the company based
in Rio de Janeiro said today in a statement. The Tupi field is
estimated to hold as much as 8 billion barrels of oil reserves.  “It’s another step forward in making the case that
Petrobras has this advantaged opportunity set,”  Rebecca Rosen ,
an analyst at PFC Energy, said in a telephone interview from
Washington D.C. “They have privileged access to one of the
world’s greatest resource bases.”  Petrobras plans to  start production  at an offshore platform
at Tupi next week that has a capacity to produce 100,000 barrels
a day. The company aims to double production to 5.38 million
barrels a day by 2020 by tapping deep-water fields, including
Tupi, the Americas’ biggest discovery in three decades.  Petrobras plans to drill two more wells this year to map
out the reservoir’s size.  Petrobras rose 1 percent to 24.40 reais as of 2:47 p.m. in
Sao Paulo trading. The stock has fallen 34 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
