African Barrick Gold Plc , the
biggest producer of the metal listed in London, said third-
quarter profit slipped 7.9 percent after output of the precious
metal declined.  Net income  fell to $39.9 million from $43.3 million a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement.
African Barrick’s so-called attributable gold output dropped 23
percent to 164,996 ounces in the quarter.  Full-year production will be comparable to 2009’s 716,000
ounces, according to the statement. The company reduced its
forecast from 750,000-800,000 ounces on Oct. 14 after saying the
Buzwagi mine in Tanzania was “widely infiltrated” by fuel
thieves. The cut follows an earlier downgrade in July when it
lowered its target from a previous range of 800,000 to 850,000
ounces because of delays at Buzwagi.  African Barrick, spun off by the world’s largest gold
producer  Barrick Gold Corp.  in March, expects to raise annual
output to more than 1 million ounces by 2014. The company
operates four mines in Tanzania.  Quarterly sales declined 1.1 percent to $208.8 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
