Tropical Cyclone Giri strengthened
into a Category 1 Storm over the northeast Indian Ocean as it
approached the west coast of Myanmar, the U.S. Joint Typhoon
Warning Center  said .  Giri’s winds strengthened to 130 kilometers (81 miles) per
hour from 65 kph yesterday, the center said its latest advisory.
A Category 1 Storm is the lowest on the five-step  Saffir Simpson
scale  and capable of “very dangerous winds,” according to the
U.S. National Hurricane Center.  The cyclone was located about 220 kilometers south-
southwest of Sittwe at 12:30 a.m. local time and was moving
north-northeast at 7.4 kph. Giri is expected to increase in
strength and hit the coast near Sittwe later today, according to
the center. It may make landfall with winds of 148 kph.  In the Indian Ocean, the Navy uses the term tropical
cyclones to describe all large circular weather systems built
around an area of low pressure. It’s the fourth storm of the
season in the Bay of Bengal.  To contact the reporter for this story:
