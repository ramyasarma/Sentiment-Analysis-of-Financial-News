Hog futures rose, capping the
biggest weekly gain since early September, on signs that the
cheapest U.S. pork in six months may revive demand from grocers.
Cattle also increased.  Wholesale pork  climbed to 76.76 cents a pound yesterday,
rebounding from the lowest level since April, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Meatpackers  shipped  17.27 million pounds
of pork in the first four days of this week, or 24 percent more
than the same time last week.  The pork price “has been going down aggressively, and
yesterday it finally maybe found some kind of support,” said
 Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des
Moines, Iowa.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 1.325 cents, or
1.9 percent, to settle at 70.65 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, after earlier slipping as much as
0.4 percent. Prices advanced 2.5 percent this week, the biggest
such gain since Sept. 3, and are up 32 percent in the past year.  U.S. pork stockpiles in September plunged 20 percent from a
year earlier to 425.5 million pounds, the USDA said today after
the close of pit trading on the CME. Supplies are shrinking
after losses in 2008 and 2009 spurred U.S. farmers to cull
herds.  Cattle Market  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.45 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $1.017 a pound in Chicago. Prices climbed 1.6
percent this week, the fourth straight weekly gain. Feeder-
cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.85 cent, or 0.8
percent, to $1.1285 a pound.  Wholesale  choice beef  climbed to $1.6098 a pound at midday,
the highest level since Sept. 8. In the first four days of this
week,  spot-market steers  sold for $1.0083 a pound, up 4.6
percent from the same time last week, according to the USDA.
U.S. exporters sold 27,500 metric tons of beef in the week ended
Oct. 14, the most since January 2008, the USDA said yesterday.  Beef exports “were some of largest sales we’ve seen in a
long time,” Roose said. “The economy appears to be recovering
just enough so that beef demand is higher domestically too.”  U.S. feedlots bought 2.462 million young cattle in
September, up 3.1 percent from the same time last year, the USDA
said after pit trading closed on the CME. Eleven analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey expected a 2.5 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
