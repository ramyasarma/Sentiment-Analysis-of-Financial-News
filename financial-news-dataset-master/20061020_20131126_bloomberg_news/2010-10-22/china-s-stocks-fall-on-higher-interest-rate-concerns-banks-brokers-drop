China’s stocks fell for a second
day, trimming gains for the week, as banks and brokers slid on
concern faster inflation may push the central bank to further
increase interest rates.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. led a gauge of
financial stocks lower after data yesterday showed the fastest
inflation in 23 months. Citic Securities Co. dropped for the
biggest two-day loss in four months on concern this month’s
gains were excessive.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
