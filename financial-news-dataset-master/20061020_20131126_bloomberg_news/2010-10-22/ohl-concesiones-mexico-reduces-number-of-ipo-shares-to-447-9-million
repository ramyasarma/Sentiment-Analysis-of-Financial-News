OHL Concesiones Mexico SA, the unit
of Spanish construction company  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA , cut the
planned size of Mexico’s largest-ever initial public offering by
19 percent.  The company will sell 448 million shares, down from the
previously projected 552 million, according to filings with
Mexico’s stock exchange. OHL plans to raise as much as 13.4
billion pesos ($1.09 billion) in the offering, down from as much
16.6 billion pesos in previous filings. The IPO price range
remained unchanged at 24 pesos to 30 pesos a share, according to
the filings.  Grupo Comercial Chedraui SAB broke a 22-month drought of
IPOs in Mexico in April. At least two more companies may sell
stock in the nation before the end of the year, Bolsa Mexicana
de Valores SAB Chief Executive Officer  Luis Tellez  said on Aug.
3. OHL plans to use the money to finance investment projects and
expand, according to the company’s prospectus.  OHL hired the local units of Banco Santander SA and Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA to handle the sale, which may occur
between Nov. 4 and Nov. 11, according to one of the filings. The
stock will be offered to Mexican and international investors,
the company said.  Gerardo Ancira , a Santander spokesman, and Irini Trujillo,
Santander equity capital markets manager, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
