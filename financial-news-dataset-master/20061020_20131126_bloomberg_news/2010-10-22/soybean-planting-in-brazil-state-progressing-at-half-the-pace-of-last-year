Soybean farmers in Brazil’s Mato
Grosso state, which accounts for about 30 percent of the
nation’s crop, had finished planting 16.4 percent of the planned
area as of yesterday, a farm research institute said.  Growers had completed 36.8 percent of the planting by the
same time last year, the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural
Economics said today in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
