Bank of England policy maker Andrew
Sentance said the pace of the rebound in manufacturing is
“encouraging.”  The industry has benefited from a “strong” global economy
and the pound, Sentance said in an interview broadcast today by
BBC West Midlands radio. Sentance, who has voted since June to
increase interest rates, said there is “nervousness” among
executives about the government spending cuts and the pace of
the recovery.  The recovery is “stronger in some areas than others,” he
said. “It’s not a uniform recovery.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
