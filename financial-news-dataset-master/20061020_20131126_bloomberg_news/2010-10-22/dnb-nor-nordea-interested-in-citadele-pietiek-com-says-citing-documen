DnB NOR ASA  and  Nordea AB  are
interested in buying Citadele Bank, the Latvian lender majority-
owned by the government,  Pietiek.com  reported, citing a document
from Nomura International Plc it obtained.  DnB NOR, Norway’s largest bank, is the “most likely
‘Nordic’ buyer” for Citadele, while Nordea would be a “good
strategic fit” according to the document published by Pietiek.
 Felicity Albert , a spokeswoman for Nomura, which advises the
government, declined to comment. Latvia’s privatization agency
didn’t address the document in an e-mail about the sale.  Citadele was split from Parex Banka AS, Latvia’s second-
biggest lender, after a rush on deposits forced the government
to rescue the bank in 2008. Latvia then turned to a group led by
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5
billion-euro ($10.4 billion) bailout.  DnB NOR hired an adviser to examine Citadele, according to
the report, and plans to meet the Latvian lender this month. A
memorandum of understanding with VMHY, a group of investors led
by  Peter Hambro  which said it was interested in Parex in March,
has been held up due to “conditions imposed,” the report said.  Trond Bentestuen and Thomas Midteide, spokesmen for DnB
NOR, weren’t available for comment when contacted by Bloomberg
News.  Parex, left with the asset-management business, non-
performing loans and other assets, has also attracted interest
from investment funds and groups of investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
