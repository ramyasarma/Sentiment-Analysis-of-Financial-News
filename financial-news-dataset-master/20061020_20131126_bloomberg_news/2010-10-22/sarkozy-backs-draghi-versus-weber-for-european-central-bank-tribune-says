French President Nicolas Sarkozy is
opposed to Bundesbank President Axel Weber succeeding Jean-
Claude Trichet as head of the European Central Bank, French
daily La Tribune reported, citing unidentified people close to
Sarkozy.  The French president has never told German Chancellor
Angela Merkel that he is prepared to leave the ECB presidency to
a German when Trichet steps down, the newspaper said. Sarkozy
would prefer Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi, the newspaper
added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
