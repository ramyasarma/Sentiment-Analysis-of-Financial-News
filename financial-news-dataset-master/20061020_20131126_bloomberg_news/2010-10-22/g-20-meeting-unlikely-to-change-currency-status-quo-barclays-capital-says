Group of 20 finance ministers and
central bank chiefs are unlikely to reach an agreement that
changes the “status quo” on currency and monetary policy this
weekend, according to Barclays Capital.  “It is hard to see any significant policy changes coming
out of the G-20 this weekend given that the differences between
the different groupings seem especially wide and their
incentives diverse,”  Giulia Comotti , a foreign-exchange
strategist at Barclays Capital in London, wrote in a research
report today.  “Furthermore, the fact that neither the Brazilian finance
minister nor central bank governor are attending the weekend
G-20 meeting, during a week when Brazil announced additional
capital controls, does not bode well for bringing all involved
parties to the negotiating table,” Comotti said.  G-20 finance ministers and central bankers began talks in
Gyeongju, South Korea, today after weeks of wrangling over
whether nations from the U.S. to China are relying on weaker
exchange rates to spur growth.        To contact the reporter on this story:
