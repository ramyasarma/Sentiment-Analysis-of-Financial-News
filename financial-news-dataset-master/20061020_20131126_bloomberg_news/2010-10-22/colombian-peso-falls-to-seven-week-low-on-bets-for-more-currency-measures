Colombia’s peso fell to a seven-week
low on speculation the central bank will take further measures
to ease the currency’s rally.  The peso extended its decline for a second week, dropping
0.5 percent to 1,828.65 per dollar at 4:20 p.m. New York time,
from 1,818.79 yesterday. It earlier fell to 1,830.30, the
weakest level since Aug. 31. Today’s decline pared the peso’s
jump this year to 11.8 percent, the second-best performance
after the Iceland krona among 25 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. The peso dropped 1.1 percent this week.  President Juan Manuel Santos said officials will “soon”
announce more measures, according to an interview this week in
La Republica newspaper. After a meeting yesterday with Santos,
his economic team and the central bank’s board, an official from
the president’s office who couldn’t be named because of
government policy said discussions on addressing the currency’s
appreciation will continue.  “All this verbal intervention has led the market to
anticipate new measures,” said  Daniel Lozano , an analyst at
Medellin-based brokerage Serfinco SA.  The central bank will likely announce new measure after its
Oct. 29 monetary policy meeting, according to Lozano. He
predicts policy makers will impose limits on borrowing abroad.  Banco de la Republica said Sept. 15 it will buy a minimum
of $20 million daily for at least four months.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due
2020 fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage points, to 7.01
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price rose 0.116 centavo to 127.454 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
