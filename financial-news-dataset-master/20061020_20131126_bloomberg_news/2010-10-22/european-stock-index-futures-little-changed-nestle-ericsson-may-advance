European  stocks declined, dragging
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index from a six-month high, as investors
speculated that additional stimulus measures by central banks
will fail to sustain the pace of the economic recovery.  Alfa Laval AB, the world’s biggest maker of heat
exchangers, lost 5.6 percent as sales in the third quarter
missed analysts’ estimates. BioMerieux SA slumped 4.5 percent
after cutting its sales growth forecast for the second time in
three months. Valeo SA, France’s second-largest auto-parts
supplier, soared 11 percent after increasing its prediction for
profit.  The  Stoxx 600  slipped 0.3 percent to 266.75 at the 4:30
p.m. close in London, after earlier swinging between gains and
losses at least 10 times. Even so, the gauge has rallied 2.7
percent this month amid speculation that slowing economic growth
will prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to announce another round
of asset purchases at its November meeting to bolster growth.
The measure has increased 0.4 percent this week and is within 2
percent of this year’s highest level reached in April.  “The anticipation of quantitative easing has sparked a
festive mood in the financial markets,” said  William de Vijlder , the chief investment officer at Fortis Investment
Management in Brussels, which manages about $246 billion.
“However, it should be borne in mind that quantitative easing
is a sign of economic weakness that calls for exceptional
measures whose effectiveness is not proven. For that reason, we
remain cautious in our equity market outlook.”  National benchmark indexes fell in 13 of the 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index  and France’s
CAC 40 Index both lost 0.3 percent. Germany’s DAX Index shed 0.1
percent.  Asset Purchases  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard 
proposed that the U.S. central bank buy $100 billion in long-
term Treasuries next month and calibrate subsequent purchases
based on the course of the economic recovery.  “If we do decide to go ahead with quantitative easing, I
think there is a good program we could adopt, one I like, which
is to think in units of $100 billion between meetings” of the
Federal Open Market Committee, Bullard said yesterday at a
conference hosted by the district bank. “We could give forward
guidance for the next meeting that would suggest how likely the
committee thinks we would continue these purchases.”  German Business Confidence  German business confidence unexpectedly rose in October to
the highest level in more than three years, suggesting growth
may not slow as much as some economists forecast. The Munich-
based Ifo institute said its  business climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, rose to 107.6 from 106.8 in
September. That’s the highest since May 2007. Economists had
expected a drop to 106.5, according to the median of 38
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Of the 46 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have announced
results since Oct. 7, 32 have beaten analyst  estimates  for per-
share income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the
U.S., 113 of the 132  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  companies that
have announced results this earnings season have topped
predictions, the data show.  Alfa Laval lost 5.6 percent to 118.50 kronor. Alfa’s third-
quarter sales of 5.8 billion kronor ($873.7 million) missed the
5.94 billion kronor average analyst estimate.  BioMerieux Slumps  BioMerieux  shed 4.5 percent to 70.48 euros, the stock’s
lowest price in more than a year. The French maker of tests for
HIV and hepatitis cited difficult health-care markets in western
Europe and North America as it cut its full-year comparable
sales forecast.  Rautaruukki Oyj , Finland’s largest producer of carbon
steel, lost 2.5 percent to 15.38 euros after posting a third-
quarter loss and lowering its full-year forecast.  Elisa Oyj  tumbled 6 percent to 16.33 euros, the biggest
retreat in the Stoxx 600. The Finnish telecommunications company
posted 363 million euros ($505 million) of net sales, missing
the 368 million-euro average of analysts’ estimates.  Valeo  surged 11 percent to 39.70 euros, the largest advance
in the Stoxx 600. France’s second-largest auto-parts supplier
raised its operating-margin forecast after reporting that third-
quarter sales climbed 22 percent. Revenue increased to 2.34
billion euros from 1.91 billion euros a year earlier.  Ericsson AB  climbed 4.2 percent to 74.90 kronor, its
largest gain in six weeks, after the world’s biggest maker of
mobile wireless networks reported net income of 3.68 billion
kronor in the third quarter, beating the 3.52 billion kronor
average analyst estimate.  Volkswagen Gains  Volkswagen AG  led European carmakers to the biggest gain in
the Stoxx 600. Its preferred shares climbed 3.2 percent to 96.76
euros. Europe’s largest carmaker said nine-month profit jumped
more than sixfold, beating analysts’ estimates.  Net income was 4 billion euros, compared with 655 million
euros a year earlier, Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW said today.
Analysts predicted profit of 2.8 billion euros, the average of
four estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales gained 20 percent to
92.5 billion euros.  Micro Focus International Plc  rallied 7.6 percent to 411.5
pence after the Daily Mail reported that International Business
Machines Corp. may be mulling a bid for the software maker for
as much as 600 pence a share.  “These bid rumors highlight the attractiveness of Micro
Focus’s migration business wherein it has a dominant
positioning,” Execution-Noble analyst  Vijay Anand  wrote in a
report today. He also said the shares are trading at a 35
percent discount to the European software industry on estimates
that are lower than management’s guidance.  Betfair Group Ltd.  surged 19 percent to 1,550 pence on its
first day of trading after the British Internet gaming site
raised 221 million pounds ($346.5 million) in its initial public
offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
