Gold fell to the lowest price in
more than two weeks, headed for a first weekly loss in six, as
Group of 20 finance chiefs debated whether to set targets for
current account imbalances to defuse tension over currencies.  Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in
South Korea today and tomorrow for talks on how to keep the
global recovery progressing amid concern that countries may be
vying with each other to weaken their currencies.  “No country will be better off in the so-called currency
war,” said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management
in Switzerland. “If this currency uncertainty is tackled by
G-20 finance ministers and central bankers, it will be negative
for gold.”  Gold for December delivery fell $4.10, or 0.3 percent, to
$1,321.50 an ounce as of 8:22 a.m. on the Comex in New York,
after earlier declining to $1,315.60, the lowest since Oct. 5.
The contract retreated 3.7 percent this week. Immediate-delivery
bullion fell 0.4 percent to $1,320.80 an ounce in London.  Gold retreated to $1,319 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,343.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  “Comments on the present ‘currency war’ should have an
impact on the U.S. currency and on gold prices too,”
 Commerzbank AG  analysts led by Eugen Weinberg said in a report
today, noting “high volatility” in precious metals prices.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a gauge against six counterparts,
was little changed at 77.404 after earlier rising as much as 0.4
percent.  Finance Ministers  Global finance ministers are planning to say in South Korea
that members will refrain from “competitive undervaluation” of
currencies, according to an official from a G-20 country, citing
a draft statement and speaking on condition of anonymity.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said nations
with persistent trade surpluses should use policy tools
including exchange rates to reduce those imbalances. Geithner
told Brazil’s Finance Minister Guido Mantega that the U.S. won’t
allow the dollar to weaken, Mantega said yesterday.  Gold rallied for the past five weeks on speculation that
the Federal Reserve may further ease monetary policy, hurting
the dollar. Bullion for immediate delivery, up 21 percent this
year, is heading for a 10th annual gain, the longest winning
streak since at least 1920. The metal has outperformed global
equities, Treasuries and most industrial metals, prompting
record investment in gold-backed exchange-traded products.  Gold Assets  Gold assets in ETPs declined 0.91 metric ton to 2,098.92
tons yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10
providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14.  “It is remarkable that the price slump this week was
accompanied by only low” outflows from exchange-traded funds,
Commerzbank said. “This implies that speculative financial
investors have taken profits.”  Ten of 19 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 53 percent, said that gold will fall next week as
some investors sell the metal after its rally to a record. Seven
forecast higher prices and two were neutral.  Silver for immediate delivery fell 0.9 percent to $22.975
an ounce in London after dropping 3.2 percent yesterday. The
metal reached $24.92 on Oct. 14, the highest level for 30 years.  Platinum declined 0.4 percent to $1,668.25 an ounce, while
palladium dropped 1.6 percent to $578.33 an ounce after reaching
a nine-year high of $605.13 last week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
