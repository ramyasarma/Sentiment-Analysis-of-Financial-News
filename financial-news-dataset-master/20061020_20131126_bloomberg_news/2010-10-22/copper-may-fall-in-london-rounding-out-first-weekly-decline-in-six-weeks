Copper may fall in London, rounding
out the first weekly drop in six weeks, as the dollar
strengthens amid speculation Group of 20 officials will agree to
refrain from weakening currencies.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, rose as much as 0.4 percent, on course for
the first weekly gain in six weeks. G-20 finance ministers and
central bankers began talks in South Korea today. Copper gained
12 percent over the prior five weeks on the London Metal
Exchange and reached a 27-month high on Oct. 19.  The “sharp price increase” prompted some investors to
sell, said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt. He pointed to the dollar as today’s main influence on
prices, with “copper and the other base metals probably staying
around current levels.”  Copper for delivery in three months fell $1 to $8,306 a
metric ton at 10:12 a.m. on the LME. The contract has shed 1.1
percent this week. December-delivery copper slipped 0.1 percent
to $3.7775 a pound on the Comex in New York.  A stronger dollar makes commodities priced in the U.S.
currency more expensive in terms of other monies and erodes
demand for raw materials as an alternative investment. LME
copper this week reached $8,492 a ton, the highest intraday
price since July 7, 2008.  Fed Meeting  G-20 policy makers are convening amid concern countries are
pursuing weaker exchange rates to support growth, either by
limiting currency gains with intervention such as China or by
discussing monetary easing, as the U.S. and U.K. have done.  The dollar fell in the previous five weeks on speculation
Federal Reserve officials will signal that further credit-easing
measures are needed to support growth when they meet next on
Nov. 2-3.  Business confidence in Germany, the world’s third-largest
copper user after the U.S. and China, unexpectedly climbed in
October to a 3 1/2-year high. The Munich-based Ifo institute
said its business climate index rose to 107.6, the highest level
since May 2007, compared with the median estimate of 38
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News for a drop to 106.5.  LME copper  stockpiles  contracted for a 35th week in a row,
matching a streak that ended in August 2004. They last climbed
in the week ended Feb. 19 and shrank 0.6 percent this week.
Today stockpiles fell 0.3 percent to 368,825 tons, the lowest
since Oct. 23, exchange figures showed.  Canceled Warrants  Copper stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose for a third week to 106,275 tons, the highest
level in almost two months, the bourse said today.  Orders to draw copper from LME inventories, or canceled
warrants, were unchanged today at 28,475 tons. They jumped 23
percent this week, the third weekly advance in a row.  Zinc climbed 1.3 percent to $2,505 a ton after reaching
$2,525, the highest intraday price since April 16. Suspended
output at Shenzhen Zhongjin Lingnan Nonfemet Co.’s Shaoguan
smelter in China will have little effect on local zinc and lead
prices because supplies are ample, said Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  “The halt in output will support prices in the short term,
as disruptions tend to,”  Feng Juncong , chief zinc and lead
analyst at Antaike, said by phone. Still, “if you take it in
the context of China’s total production, the impact is not
big.”  Lead, Aluminum  Lead gained 0.6 percent to $2,500 a ton after reaching
$2,519, the highest price since Jan. 14.  Aluminum advanced 0.1 percent to $2,353 a ton. China will
sell 96,000 tons of aluminum ingots from state stockpiles on
Nov. 1-2, the state reserve authority under the National
Development and Reform Commission said on its website.  “China has already proved in the past that they are very
good traders,” Commerzbank’s Briesemann said. “We might be
very close to peak aluminum prices.”  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME slid 0.4 percent to
$26,350 a ton. Prices reached a record $27,338.50 on Oct. 14.
The metal has jumped 55 percent this year, leading advances on
the exchange, after production was disrupted in Indonesia and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Nickel fell 1 percent to $23,325 a ton.  To contact the reporter on the story:
