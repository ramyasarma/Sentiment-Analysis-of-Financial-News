India has asked a  Vodafone Group Plc 
unit to pay 112.2 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) related to its
purchase of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.’s mobile phone unit in the
South Asian nation.  Vodafone International Holdings BV has 30 days to comply
with the tax demand, according to a statement from the country’s
Central Board of Direct Taxes today. Vodafone said it “strongly
disagrees” with the tax calculation, and the matter will be
reviewed by India’s Supreme Court Oct. 25, according to a
company statement.  The Indian tax department’s order is “unfounded” and the
company “will continue to take whatever actions are necessary
to defend itself in this matter,” it said in the statement.  The case relates to Vodafone’s $11 billion acquisition of a
67 percent stake in Hutchison’s Indian mobile-phone unit in
2007. India’s finance ministry estimates Vodafone’s tax
liability on the purchase at more than 120 billion rupees,
S.S.N. Moorthy, chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes,
said Sept. 27.  The company may be ordered to pay a part of the total
liability pending a final judgment on the case, the Supreme
Court said Sept. 27.  Vodafone Group has said it doesn’t owe the Indian
government taxes because the transaction was conducted offshore,
with its Dutch unit acquiring a Cayman Islands holding company
controlled by Hong Kong-based Hutchison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
