Gold Fields Ltd. said tramming
stopped at the company’s Beatrix no. 3 shaft after a worker was
killed yesterday.  “A section 54 was issued stopping all tramming at the
shaft until the official inspection has been concluded some time
this morning,” spokesman Sven Lunsche said in an interview on
his mobile phone from Johannesburg today. “Any production
impact will be minimal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
