Poland is “very dissatisfied”
after receiving a letter from the European Commission stating it
isn’t possible to account for the cost of pension overhaul in
debt and deficit calculations, as requested by Poland and eight
other European Union member states, Finance Minister spokeswoman
Magda Kobos said today.  “Poland maintains its position on deficit and debt
calculations and will present its arguments at the next session
of the European Council,” Kobos said by phone from Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
