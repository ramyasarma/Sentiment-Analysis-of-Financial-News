Crude oil may decline next week
after China’s oil processing grew the least in 18 months as
government measures to cool the economy reduced fuel demand, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Fourteen of 30 analysts, or 47 percent, forecast crude oil
will fall through Oct. 29. Eleven respondents, or 37 percent,
predicted prices will be little changed and five estimated an
increase. Last week analysts were split over whether futures
would drop or climb.  Data from the China Mainland Marketing Research Co.
yesterday showed that refineries in the world’s biggest energy-
consuming country processed about 8.5 million barrels a day in
September. That’s a 6.6 percent gain from a year earlier, the
smallest increase since March 2009.  “The China demand numbers failed to wow us so I think that
may lead to even more liquidation,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in Chicago.  U.S. crude-oil  inventories  climbed 667,000 barrels to 361.2
million barrels last week, the highest level since August, an
Energy Department report showed on Oct. 20. Gasoline stockpiles
rose 1.12 million barrels to 219.3 million, the first increase
in four weeks.  Crude oil for December delivery declined 24 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $81.69 a barrel this week on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are up 0.6 percent from a year ago.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
