China’s yuan forwards dropped most
in 22 months on speculation the government will rely more
heavily on interest-rate hikes to damp inflation, curbing the
need for currency gains to reduce import costs.  China’s central bank raised its benchmark one-year lending
and deposit rates on Oct. 19 before a government report showed
 consumer prices  climbed 3.6 percent in September from a year
earlier, the fastest pace in 23 months. The U.S. Dollar  Index 
traded on ICE futures in New York, which tracks the greenback
against those of six trading partners, has risen 1.8 percent
since reaching a 10-month low of 76.144 on Oct. 15.  “On the one hand, the market speculates that the central
bank will rely on rate hikes, instead of appreciation, to
contain inflation,” said  Isaac Meng , a Beijing-based economist
at BNP Paribas. “On the other hand, the market is unwinding
short dollar positions as the Dollar Index is already at such a
low level.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.78 percent to
6.4750 per dollar as of 6:01 p.m. in Shanghai, reflecting bets
the currency will strengthen 2.8 percent in one year’s time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the biggest
decline since December 2008. The contracts were down 0.71
percent for the week.  The yuan dropped 0.27 percent to 6.6590 against the dollar
this week and was down 0.13 percent today, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency has
strengthened 2.4 percent since a two-year dollar peg was
scrapped on June 19.  The People’s Bank of China set the reference rate at 6.6759
per dollar, the weakest level in more than a week, from 6.6695
yesterday.  Finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations will meet in
Gyeongju, South Korea, today before the countries’ leaders meet
for talks next month in Seoul.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
