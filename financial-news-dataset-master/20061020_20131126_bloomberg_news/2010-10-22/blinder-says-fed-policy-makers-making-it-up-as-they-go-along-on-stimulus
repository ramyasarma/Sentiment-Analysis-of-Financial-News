U.S. central bankers are improvising
as they debate embarking on a second round of unconventional
monetary stimulus, said  Alan Blinder , former vice chairman of
the Federal Reserve.  “They are making it up as they go along,” Blinder, a
Princeton University economist, said in a television interview
on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  Blinder said he doesn’t expect the central bank to announce
a so-called “shock and awe” strategy of asset purchases after
its Nov. 2-3 meeting but will “dribble it out” by buying in
smaller increments.  “It does take a lot of money to move the prices of
government bonds,” Blinder said, adding that “$500 billion for
the total amount is too small.”  The program of asset purchases that policy makers are
“about to embark upon is a lot like what the Japanese did,” he
said. The U.S. bond market is “deeper and more liquid a
market,” which will make it harder for the Fed to lower
interest rates through their purchases, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
