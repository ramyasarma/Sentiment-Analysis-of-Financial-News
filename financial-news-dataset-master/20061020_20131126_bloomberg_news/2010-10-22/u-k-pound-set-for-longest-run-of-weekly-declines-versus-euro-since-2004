The pound was little changed against
the euro, headed for its sixth weekly slide, the longest run of
declines since November 2004.  Sterling traded at 88.72 pence per euro as of 7:38 a.m. in
London, leaving it about 1.5 percent lower in the week.  The U.K. currency advanced 0.2 percent to $1.5739, trimming
its first week decline in three.  To contact the reporter on this story:
