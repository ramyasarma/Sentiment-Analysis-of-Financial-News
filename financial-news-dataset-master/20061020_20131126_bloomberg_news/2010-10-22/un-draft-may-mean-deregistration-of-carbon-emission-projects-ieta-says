A United Nations draft proposal to
limit excess issuance of Certified Emission Reductions may
result in the “deregistration” of projects, the International
Emissions Trading Association said today in a statement.  “The desire to limit excess issuance must be balanced”
with the need to keep carbon-project auditors and investors
interested in the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism, Henry
Derwent, president of Geneva-based IETA, said in an Oct. 8
letter to the UN. The letter responded to UN carbon regulators’
request for input.    IETA said the market implication of the UN proposal would
be severe and recommended a cap on the liability for project
auditors known as DOEs, among other proposals. For a link to the
