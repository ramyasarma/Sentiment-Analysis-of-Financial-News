Betfair Group Ltd. (BET) , a British
Internet gaming site, climbed 19 percent in its first day of
trading after its  London  initial public offering raised 211
million pounds ($332 million).  Betfair’s owners sold 16.2 million shares at 13 pounds
each, the London-based company said in a statement on the
Regulatory News Service today. The shares advanced 250 pence to
15.50 pounds in London. The gain was the best first-day
performance among London IPOs since May 2009, when  Max Property
Group Plc (MAX)  surged 30 percent in its debut, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Betfair initially set a price range for the IPO at 11
pounds to 14 pounds each. Some large shareholders could sell a
further 1.8 million shares through the so-called overallotment
option within 30 days, according to the company.  “We have many opportunities to grow our leading position
in the online sports betting and gaming market,” Chief
Executive Officer David Yu said in the statement. “We are
extremely pleased that new investors share our enthusiasm for
the future of the business.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  managed the IPO
along with Barclays Plc and Numis Securities Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
