Crude oil is poised to reach $90 a
barrel by the middle of December, according to technical
analysis by Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  The December contract, which became the front-month
contract yesterday, has been trading in an uptrend, a pattern of
higher peaks and higher valleys, since touching a low of $75.10
on Sept. 23,  Blake Robben , a strategist at Lind-Waldock, a
division of MF Global Ltd., said in an interview.  “Since then, the market has made higher highs and higher
lows,” Robben said. A line drawn from the Sept. 23 low to the
Oct. 20 low of $79.90 projects to $90 by the middle of December,
he said.  The initial target for the rising price is $86.52, the high
on May 13, which may be reached by the middle of November,
Robben said.  “If we close below $79.90, the uptrend is over and we’re
back in a trading range of $75 to $85,” he said.  Crude oil for December delivery settled at $80.56 a barrel
yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
