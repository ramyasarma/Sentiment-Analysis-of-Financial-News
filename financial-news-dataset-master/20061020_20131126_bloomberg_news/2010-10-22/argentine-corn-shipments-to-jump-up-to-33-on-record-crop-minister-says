Argentina, the world’s second-
largest corn exporter, will increase shipments of the grain by
as much as 33 percent as farmers plant a record crop,
Agriculture Minister  Julian Dominguez  said.  The government plans to set an export quota of 19 million
to 20 million metric tons of corn in the 2010-2011 crop year, up
from 15 million tons in the previous season, Dominguez said
today in an interview in Santiago.  “We will open exports when we have a final confirmation of
the number of planted hectares,” he said.  Farmers will harvest a record 27 million tons from the crop
that’s being planted now and will be  harvested  between February
and August, Dominguez said. That’s up from about 22 million tons
in the previous crop.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 0.75 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $5.65 a bushel at 11:49 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. On Oct. 13, the price reached $5.88, the highest level
for a most-active contract since August 2008.  Argentina’s wheat crop will reach 13 million tons,
Dominguez said. The crop is harvested from November to January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
