HSBC Holdings Plc ’s head of Asian
private banking,  Monica Wong , is retiring after 27 years at the
bank amid a leadership reshuffle that will also see its global
private banking head move to Hong Kong from London.  Wong, whose retirement is effective Dec. 31, will be
succeeded by  Desmond Liu , who will head North Asia, and  Nancie Dupier , who will head Southeast Asia, according to an e-mailed
statement from Europe’s largest bank yesterday. Separately,
 Alexandre Zeller  has been appointed as chief executive officer
for private banking in Europe, Middle East and Africa, HSBC said.  The appointments position the private bank to “take
advantage of the entrepreneurial wealth creation that is taking
place in the emerging markets,”  Chris Meares , HSBC’s CEO of
global private banking, said in the statement. Meares’ proposed
move to Hong Kong to oversee the leadership transition reflects
the importance of Asia, HSBC said, without specifying when he
will relocate.  The number of individuals with at least $1 million of
investable assets in Asia-Pacific rose 26 percent to 3 million
in 2009, matching Europe and almost in line with North America’s
3.1 million, according to Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth
Management, as the region led the global economic recovery.  Wong, the widowed daughter of a shipping tycoon, was in the
spotlight four years ago when she won a Hong Kong lawsuit
seeking the return of HK$60 million ($7.7 million) in fees she
paid for Latin dance lessons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
