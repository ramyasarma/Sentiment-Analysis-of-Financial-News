Corn futures fell for a second day
after a government report signaled importers slowed purchases
from the U.S. last week after prices reached the highest level
in more than two years.  Exporters sold  212,478 metric tons in the week ended Oct.
14, down 77 percent from a week earlier and 72 percent less than
the average of the previous four weeks, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said yesterday. Before today, corn futures surged 59
percent since May 31 as adverse weather reduced output in the
U.S., the world’s biggest grower and shipper.  “Export data has not been robust the last two or three
weeks,” said  Dan Basse , the president of AgResource Co. in
Chicago. “I would also have some sticker shock too if I was an
importer of corn. It’s too early to say exports have been
rationed by higher prices.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 4.25 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $5.60 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the seventh decline in the past eight sessions.  The grain fell 0.5 percent this week, after surging 21
percent the past two weeks. On Oct. 13, the price reached $5.88,
the highest level for a most-active contract since August 2008.  Earlier Slump  Prices earlier rose on signs of increased U.S. demand for
the grain from ethanol refiners and livestock producers.  Daily average  ethanol production  rose to a record 881,000
barrels a day in the week ended Oct. 15 from an average of
854,000 barrels the prior four weeks, the Department of Energy
said Oct. 20. The number of  chicks  put on feed rose 5.6 percent
to 169.2 million in the week ended Oct. 16, the government said.
U.S. cattle feedlots probably increased purchases 2.9 percent
last month from a year earlier, a Bloomberg News survey shows.  “Ethanol production continues to grow because producers
are making money,” said  Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness
at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. “Cattle are still
moving into feedlots, and the chicken industry is expanding.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
