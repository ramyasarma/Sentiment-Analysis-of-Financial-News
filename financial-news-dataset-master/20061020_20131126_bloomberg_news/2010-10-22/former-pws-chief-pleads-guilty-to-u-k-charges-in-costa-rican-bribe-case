Julian Messent, the former chief
executive officer of PWS International Ltd, pleaded
guilty to paying more than $2 million in bribes to win contracts
in Costa Rica.  Messent admitted to two counts of corruption for funneling
money to at least three Costa Rican officials to retain
reinsurance contracts from a state-owned telecommunications and
electricity company.  “These were very large government contracts with high
premiums and large amounts of money being funneled back,” Hodge
Malek, a lawyer for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted
the case, told a London court today.  PWS, a London-based reinsurance company founded by  Lord Malcolm Pearson , was bought by THB Group in 2008. Pearson, a
member of the House of Lords and the former head of the U.K.
Independence Party, founded PWS in 1964.  Messent is scheduled to be sentenced later today.  Costa Rican prosecutors are investigating 10 people for
accepting bribes in the case, SFO spokeswoman Katie Winstanley
said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
