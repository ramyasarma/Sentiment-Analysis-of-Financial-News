Palm oil climbed, increasing for an
eighth consecutive week, after two analysts raised their price
predictions on the view that gains in soybean oil will boost
demand for the substitute commodity.  The January-delivery contract gained as much as 0.8 percent
to 3,014 ringgit ($968) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, and traded at 3,001 ringgit at 12:23 p.m. in Singapore.
The most active month was up 2.5 percent this week and headed
for its longest rally since the 10 weeks ended May 25, 2007.  Palm oil may average 2,750 ringgit a ton in 2011, more than
an earlier estimate of 2,470 ringgit, as rising soybean oil
prices bolster substitution demand,  Ben Santoso , a plantation
analyst at DBSVickers Securities (Singapore), said by e-mail.  “Firm soy oil prices provide a further boost to crude palm
oil prices,” he said. The commodity may average 2,700 ringgit a
ton next year, up from an earlier prediction of 2,600 ringgit,
buoyed by a weakening dollar and lower U.S. soybean estimates,
Citigroup Global Markets Malaysia Sdn. said in a report today.  Soybean oil in Chicago advanced as much as 0.9 percent to
48.65 cents a pound, and traded at 48.61 cents a pound, widening
its  premium  to palm oil to $107.82 a ton, compared with an
average of $100.48 a ton last week and $83.14 last month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  CME Group Inc.’s January palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, gained 4.3 percent to $966.25 a ton.  Palm oil on the Dalian Commodity Exchange for May delivery
gained as much as 0.9 percent to 8,370 yuan ($1,257) a ton and
traded at 8,346 yuan by the 11:30 a.m. break. The most active
contract was poised for its fifth weekly gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
