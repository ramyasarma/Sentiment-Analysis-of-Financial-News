Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA, Europe’s
biggest supplier of building materials, doesn’t exclude the
possibility of selling control of its packaging unit, Chief
Executive Officer Pierre-Andre de Chalendar told Les Echos in an
interview.  The company has said it may sell a minority stake in the
unit in an initial public offering no sooner than the second
quarter of 2011. Saint-Gobain doesn’t exclude “a second stage
where we would give up control,” De Chalendar told Les Echos.  He also said in the interview that while strikes in France
aren’t disrupting the company’s activities, operations are being
complicated.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
