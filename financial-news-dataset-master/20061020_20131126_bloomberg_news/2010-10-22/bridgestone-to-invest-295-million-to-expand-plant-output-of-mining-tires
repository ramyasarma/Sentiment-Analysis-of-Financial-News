Bridgestone Corp. , the world’s
largest tiremaker by sales, will invest 24 billion yen ($296
million) to increase production capacity for large tires and
steel cords for vehicles used by construction and mining
companies.  The expansion, at its plants in Fukuoka and Saga
prefectures in southern Japan, is scheduled to be completed in
the second half of 2013, Bridgestone said in a statement today.
The company will raise daily tire production at the plant in
Kitakyushu City, Fukuoka, to 130 tons from 30 tons currently.  Bridgestone, based in Tokyo, will spend 22 billion yen on
the tire plant expansion and 2 billion yen on the steel cord
factory, the company said.  Shares in the company rose 1.4 percent to 1,448 yen. The
stock has fallen 11 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
