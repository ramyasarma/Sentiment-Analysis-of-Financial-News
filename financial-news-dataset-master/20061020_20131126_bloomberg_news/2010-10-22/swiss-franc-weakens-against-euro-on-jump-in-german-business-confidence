The franc depreciated to its weakest
level in two months versus the euro after a measure of German
 business confidence  unexpectedly climbed, reducing demand for
the Swiss currency as a haven.  The franc also slipped against the dollar after the Munich-
based Ifo institute said today its business climate  index  rose
to 107.6 from 106.8 in September, the highest since May 2007.
The German government yesterday more than doubled its 2010
growth forecast to 3.4 percent, boosting confidence in the euro-
region recovery.  “Stronger European data, for example today the German Ifo
index, points to a little bit of a modest upside for the euro
against the Swiss franc, probably to the 1.36 area in the very
near term,” said  Marcus Hettinger , a currency strategist at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.  The franc declined 1.2 percent to 1.3630 per euro at 17:36
p.m. in London, after weakening to 1.3629, the lowest since Aug.
12. It depreciated 1.2 percent to 0.9793 per dollar, from 0.9678
yesterday.  The franc has climbed 3.6 percent this year against a
basket of currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
