KDDI Corp. , Japan’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, said profit in the fiscal second quarter
rose 10 percent as the fixed line business returned to profit.  Net income  climbed to 65 billion yen ($802 million), from
58.9 billion yen a year earlier, the Tokyo-based company said in
a statement today. KDDI left its full-year profit outlook
unchanged.  The carrier, forecasting a profit decline in mobile-phone
operations, is looking to recovery of its fixed-line business to
help achieve annual profit targets. KDDI, which invested about
$3.9 billion in cable-television provider  Jupiter
Telecommunications Co.  to access more fixed-line customers, has
said it aims to make money from the business this fiscal year.  KDDI also said it plans to buy back as much as 5.16 percent
of its outstanding shares for as much as 100 billion yen,
according to a statement to the exchange. It plans to pay a
full-year dividend of 13,000 yen.  The company reported  operating profit , or sales minus the
cost of goods sold and administrative expenses, rose 8.6 percent
to 118.6 billion yen in the quarter, exceeding the 117.6 billion
yen average of three analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue slumped 1.9 percent to 852.4 billion yen, less than the
859.6 billion yen expected by the analysts.  Net income  will increase 13 percent to 240 billion yen in
the 12 months ending March 31, KDDI said in April, citing a
return to profit in the fixed-line business and a charge a year
earlier.  Operating profit  will probably climb 0.3 percent to 445
billion yen while revenue may fall 0.1 percent to 3.44 trillion
yen, it said.  The  shares  rose 0.4 percent to close at 406,500 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange before the announcement. The benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
