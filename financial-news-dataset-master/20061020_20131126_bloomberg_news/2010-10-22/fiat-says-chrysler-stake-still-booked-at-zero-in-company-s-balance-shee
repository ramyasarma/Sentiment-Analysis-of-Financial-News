Fiat SpA kept the balance-sheet
value of its 20 percent stake in Chrysler Group LLC at the end
of September at “nil,” according to the interim report
distributed by the Italian exchange today.  Fiat “has no obligation” in respect of Chrysler’s losses,
the company said. If Chrysler subsequently reports profits, Fiat
“may only recognise these once its share of the profits equals
the share of losses not recognised in prior periods.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
