Natixis SA , the French investment
bank, sold 50 million euros ($69 million) of 10-year notes that
pay coupons linked to price swings in the euro swap rate.  The securities Natixis calls “Supervol Bonds” pay 10
times the difference between the highest and lowest swap rates
for each year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
coupon is capped at the 10-year swap rate plus 88 basis points,
or 0.88 percentage point, and has a floor of zero percent.  Volatility on 10-year options for euro interest-rate swaps,
known as swaptions, was 85.7, down from this year’s peak of
91.15 in September, composite prices on Bloomberg show.
Volatility is likely to remain low in the near future, said
 Giles Gale , an interest-rate strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in London.  “We are heading toward an environment where there won’t be
excess liquidity in the market and inflation is less of a
concern,” Gale said. “I can’t see central banks being likely
to move rates too quickly. All these factors make it harder to
imagine rates volatility going forward.”  The euro 10-year swap rate, the cost of exchanging fixed
interest payments for floating rates, is 2.78 percent. The level
dropped to 2.265 percent Aug. 30, the lowest since the euro’s
start in 1999. Its highest level this year was 3.6415 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
