             Joy Global Inc. (JOY)  climbed in extended
U.S. trading after the maker of mining equipment doubled its
share repurchase program to $2 billion.  
 Joy Global increased 3 percent to $46.30 at 5:55 p.m. in
New York. The company also extended the buyback's expiration to
the end of 2011 from the end of 2008, according to a statement
sent by Globe Newswire.  
 Actel Corp. dropped 5 percent to $10.74. The maker of
electronic equipment said third-quarter revenue may fall as much
as 9 percent from the second quarter. The company had previously

 Carlos Slim  and his family acquired a 6.4 percent stake in the
newspaper publisher, according to a regulatory filing today. The
shares slipped 0.3 percent to $13.96 on Sept. 10.  
 U.S. stocks rose today as investors snapped up energy
shares trading at their cheapest level in 18 months, while
better-than-forecast earnings at FedEx Corp. buoyed industrial
companies.
