             Qatar Petroleum , the country's state-
run oil and gas company, offered to sell three different types of
condensate, totaling 980,000 metric tons, for loading in the year
from January, according to offer documents.  
 The refiner offered to load a total of 148,000 metric tons
of Al-Khaleej Gas plant condensate liquids in shipments of 18,000
tons in the twelve months from January.  
 The oil is produced at the Al-Khaleej Gas plant operated by
Ras Laffen Liquefied Natural Gas Co., or RasGas, a Qatar
Petroleum venture with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)   
 Separately, Qatar Petroleum offered to sell 247,000 tons of
Qatar Return condensate natural gas liquids in lots of 19,000
tons. The gas liquids are from the natural gas plant operated by
Qatar Liquefied Gas Co., or Qatargas, the offer document said.  
 Additionally, Qatar Petroleum invited bids for 585,000 tons
of RasGas plant condensate. The refiner asked potential buyers to
load the fuel in lots of about 19,000 tons.  
 All the cargoes will load at Ras Laffan port between Jan. 1
and Dec. 31, 2007.  
 Potential buyers were to submit bids against Persian Gulf
quotes for naphtha by oil-pricing service Platts, and to keep
their bids valid until Nov. 13, according to the documents
received by  Bloomberg News .  
 Condensate, a type of light oil produced in association with
natural gas production, can yield as much as 60 percent of
naphtha and gasoline.
