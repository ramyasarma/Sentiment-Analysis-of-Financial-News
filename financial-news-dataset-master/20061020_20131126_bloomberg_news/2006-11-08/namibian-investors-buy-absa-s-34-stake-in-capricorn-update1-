             Namibian investors have bought  Absa
Group Ltd. (ASA) 's 34.4 percent stake in Capricorn Investment Holdings
Ltd., a Windhoek-based financial services company, for an
undisclosed amount.  
 Johannesburg-based Absa agreed to sell its stake in
Capricorn, which owns banks in Botswana and Zambia, after it
sold a controlling stake to  Barclays Plc (BARC) , making Absa and
Capricorn rivals, Johan Swanepoel, the managing director of
Capricorn, said in an e-mailed statement today. The investors
weren't identified.  
 Absa,  South Africa 's biggest consumer bank, plans to buy
nine Barclays units in sub-Saharan Africa, including its
operations in Botswana and Zambia, by the end of next year.
Capricorn, which owns a controlling stake in Bank Windhoek, the
fourth-biggest Namibian bank, opened a bank in Botswana in
September and owns a stake in  Zambia 's Cavmont Capital Bank.  
 Absa's ``investment in CIH no longer falls in line with its
wider African strategy owing to CIH's planned regional expansion
program,'' Absa said in a statement to South Africa's stock
exchange. Cooperation between CIH, Absa and Bank Windhoek will
continue in ``structured finance, syndication of large and
complex corporate finance transactions and settlement
accounts.''  
 Absa will have first rights to buy CIH's stake in Bank
Windhoek should the company decide to sell it, the company
added.
