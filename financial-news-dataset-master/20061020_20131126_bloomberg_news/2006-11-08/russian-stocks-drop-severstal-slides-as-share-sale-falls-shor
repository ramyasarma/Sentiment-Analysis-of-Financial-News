             Russian stocks fell from a five-month
high, pushed lower by OAO Severstal, after the country's biggest
steelmaker by sales raised a less-than-expected $1.06 billion in
a public share offering.  
 The dollar-denominated RTS Index lost 0.7 percent to 1663.19
in Moscow, sliding from its highest since May 12. The ruble-based
Micex Index fell 0.2 percent to 1477.37.  
 Severstal slid 7.3 percent, or 95 cents, to $12.05.
Billionaire owner Alexei Mordashov sold 85 million shares, or 9.1
percent of the company, at $12.50 each. Mordashov had sought to
raise as much as $1.89 billion.  
 Russian companies, prompted by a six-year stock market
rally, have raised $16.5 billion in share sales this year, one-
and-a-half times the amount raised in the previous five years.  
 Mordashov wants to raise Severstal's profile with foreign
investors after the company lost out to Mittal Steel Co. in a
contest to combine with Arcelor SA earlier this year.  
 OAO Pharmstandard, a drugmaker co-owned by  Russia 's richest
man  Roman Abramovich , said today it's postponing an initial
public offering until the first half of next year as it reviews
the structure of the sale.  
 OAO Surgutneftegaz, Russia's fourth-largest oil producer,
fell 1.7 percent to $1.30, reversing yesterday's 2.7 percent
gain. OAO Gazprom, the country's biggest natural-gas producer,
declined 1.4 percent to $10.88.  
 OAO Polyus Gold, Russia's biggest producer of the precious
metal, fell 1.1 percent to $47, extending yesterday's 1 percent
loss. The company said today it completed a $1 billion share
buyback at a 35 percent premium.  
 Jenington International Inc., a Polyus unit, bought 17.2
million Polyus shares for $58 each. The price was 35 percent
higher that the stock's closing price in Moscow yesterday.  
 Shares of OAO VSMPO-Avisma, the world's biggest titanium
producer, advanced 6.9 percent to $249, after adding 5 percent in
the previous session. Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport
completed its purchase of 66 percent of VSMPO-Avisma yesterday.
