Stock mutual funds are having their
worst year since 1998 in matching their benchmarks, as higher
correlation among shares makes it harder to pick stocks in a
“whipsawing” market,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said  Among 2,920 funds tracked by the brokerage, 27 percent
underperformed their benchmarks by more than 5 percentage points
this year, the most since the 35 percent recorded in 1998. Only
7 percent of the funds beat the market by the same margin, the
lowest level in 15 years, JPMorgan data showed.  “2010 has been a ‘whipsaw’ moving in a wide range and, as
a result, active managers are badly trailing their indices,”
JPMorgan Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Thomas J. Lee wrote in the
report last week. “Trending markets tend to be better for
active managers.”  Earnings grew at the fastest rate since 1988 this year even
as the economy showed signs of faltering. Making it harder to
pick investments, stocks moved in lockstep more than in at least
two years. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied as much as
9.2 percent from its Dec. 31 close and dropped as much as 8.3
percent this year. The average correlation of S&P 500 stocks
climbed to 81.09 on Aug. 24, the highest level since Bloomberg
began tracking the CBOE S&P 500 Implied Correlation Index in
November 2008.  The trailing funds are likely to increase holdings in
companies that move the most relative to the benchmark, known as
high-beta stocks, to boost performance, Lee said. Investors
therefore should buy companies tied to economic growth such as
industrials, he said. Included on his list of high-beta cyclical
stocks are  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) ,  Deere & Co. (DE)  and  Macy’s Inc. (M)   To contact the reporter on this story:
