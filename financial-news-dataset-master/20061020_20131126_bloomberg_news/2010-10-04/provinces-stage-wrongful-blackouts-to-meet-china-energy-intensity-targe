Blackouts have occurred in some
Chinese provinces as local governments try to meet energy
efficiency targets by the end of the year, according to the
 National Reform and Development Commission of China .  The blackouts have taken place as a five-year national plan
to reduce energy intensity, or energy consumption per unit of
GDP, by 20 percent ends in December,  Xie Zhenhua , vice chairman
of China’s top economic planner, said today in Tianjin, China.  The central government is halting the blackouts as soon as
they are being discovered, the vice chairman said, without
identifying where the outages took place. China Armco Metals
Inc., a distributor of imported metal ore, said last month that
its operations would be affected by the Jiangsu provincial
government’s rolling blackouts scheduled for September.  “Only six or seven provinces are facing difficulty in
meeting the targets, and in order to complete the task they’re
carrying out wrongdoings that run counter to the spirit of the
target,” the vice chairman said today. “China’s 20 percent
target is legally binding and we’re determined to meet it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
