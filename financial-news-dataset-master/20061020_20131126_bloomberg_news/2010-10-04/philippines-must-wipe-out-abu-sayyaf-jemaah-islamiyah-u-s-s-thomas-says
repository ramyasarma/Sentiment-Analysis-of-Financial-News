The Philippines needs to wipe out the
Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah groups because of the threat
they pose to the country and Southeast Asia, U.S. Ambassador
Harry Thomas said today.  U.S. troops deployed “temporarily” in the southern part
of the country are providing “information and support” to the
Philippine military, Thomas said at a news conference in Manila.  “Simple reduction of the threat is insufficient,” he said.
“We must be vigilant. We’re at a critical threshold,” he said
without elaborating.  Abu Sayyaf has conducted kidnappings and bombings in
southern Philippines since the 1990s while Jemaah Islamiyah has
been blamed for the 2002 Bali attack that left 202 dead. The U.S.
and Philippine governments have linked the two organizations and
al Qaeda.  Suspected Bali bomber Dulmatin hid in the Philippines after
the bombing, according to police reports. He was killed in a
police raid in Jakarta in March.  Abu Sayyaf leader Khadaffy Janjalani, was killed in a
firefight with soldiers in the southern Philippine island of
Jolo in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
