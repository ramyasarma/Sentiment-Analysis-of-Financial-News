The management of the Warsaw Stock
Exchange will visit investors this month as the government
begins to sell a majority stake in central Europe’s biggest
equity market.  The bourse started so-called education meetings with
investors today and plans a roadshow to discuss the prospectus
from Oct. 15 through Oct. 28, according to a term sheet obtained
by Bloomberg today. Pricing is to be announced on Oct. 28 before
the shares start trading Nov. 9, the terms showed.  Poland plans to sell 64 percent of the country’s sole
exchange as part of a plan to raise 25 billion zloty ($8.6
billion) to help finance the 2010 budget gap. The government has
earned 13.1 billion zloty so far, selling stakes in insurance,
energy, telephone, copper and coal mining companies.  The Warsaw bourse is the third-largest in emerging Europe
after Moscow and Istanbul, with a market capitalization of $186
billion and almost 550 equities traded on its main market and
NewConnect platform for smaller companies.  The company, which will be the first publicly traded
exchange operator in central Europe, is awaiting approval for
the IPO from the country’s financial-services regulator after
filing its prospectus on Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
