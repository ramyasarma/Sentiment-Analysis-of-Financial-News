A report scheduled to be published
today on the potential sale of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.
urges the Canadian province of Saskatchewan to study the past
corporate behavior of possible buyers, the Globe and Mail said.  The Conference Board of Canada’s report suggests
examination of corporate practices should precede a decision on
whether to support a potential bid, the newspaper reported,
citing  Glen Hodgson , the board’s chief economist.  Saskatchewan commissioned the report after BHP Billiton
Ltd.’s hostile bid for Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Potash
Corp. and because of the potential for competing offers from
China and elsewhere, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
