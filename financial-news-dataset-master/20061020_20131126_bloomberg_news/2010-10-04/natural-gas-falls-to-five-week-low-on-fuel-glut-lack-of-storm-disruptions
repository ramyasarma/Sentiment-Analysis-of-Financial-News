Natural gas futures fell to the
lowest level in more than five weeks on speculation weak demand
and a lack of storms in Gulf of Mexico production regions will
boost a stockpile surplus.  Gas dropped as no major storms hit the Gulf in September,
statistically  the most active month  of the hurricane season. Gas
inventories were 6.3 percent above the five-year average in the
week ended Sept. 24, according to the Energy Department, as mild
weather reduced demand for gas for cooling and heating.  “We have fewer bullish fundamentals to stop the slide,”
said  Brad Florer , a trader at Kottke Associates Inc., an energy
trading firm in Louisville, Kentucky. “Storms were not a
situation as we close out the storm season, and we have plenty
of gas.”  Natural gas for November delivery fell 7 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $3.727 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement price since Aug.
27. Gas futures have fallen 33 percent this year.  Cool weather in the U.S. Northeast will “give way to much
warmer weather” later this week and next week, according to MDA
Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in Rockville, Maryland.  About 53 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating.  New York will have a high temperature of 71 degrees
Fahrenheit (22 Celsius) on Oct. 9 and a low of 51, according to
 the National Weather Service . The city will have a high of 58
degrees today.  Caribbean Weather System  A weather system over the northeastern Caribbean has a 20
percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone during the next 48
hours, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at 2
p.m. New York time. The system was moving west-northwest at
about 10 miles (16 kilometers) per hour.  About 10 percent of U.S. gas output will come from federal
waters in the Gulf this year, down from 17 percent five years
ago, according to Energy Department estimates. Gulf production
dropped 52 percent in the past 10 years.  Gas stockpiles rose 74 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Sept. 24 to 3.414 trillion, the Energy Department said. The gain
was above the five-year weekly average for a third week.  Excessive gas supply may continue through next year,
keeping spot prices relatively low, GDF Suez SA Executive Vice
President  Jean-Marie Dauger  said today at a conference in Paris.  Chesapeake Energy Corp., the second-biggest producer of
U.S. natural gas, sold future output of the heating and power-
plant fuel to a Barclays Plc affiliate, raising $1.15 billion to
fund drilling and cut debt.  U.S. households’ natural gas bills may rise by about 7
percent this winter amid increased industrial demand for the
fuel, the American Gas Association said today.  Bullish Bets  Hedge funds and other large speculators  cut  bullish bets on
natural gas by 25 percent in the week ended Sept. 28, the most
since August, according to the weekly Commitments of Traders
report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Net-long positions in futures and options combined in four
natural-gas contracts decreased by  17,373  futures equivalents to
51,306 in the week ended Sept. 28, the CFTC data showed.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, dropped 10.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $3.5633 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
175,748 as of 2:36 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
257,000. Volume was 177,117 on Oct. 1. Open interest was 789,836
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 806,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
