Crude oil may fail to breach the
$86.70 a-barrel level this week based on statistical analysis
used by traders to gauge prices, the Schork Group Inc. said.  Crude’s resistance at that level corresponds to the upper
limit of the confidence interval, a statistical range with a
specified probability that a given parameter lies within the
boundaries. Oil is most likely to trade this week between $76.76
a barrel and $86.70, according to the Schork Group.  Oil prices have jumped 4.7 percent since Sept. 29 to $81.53
today as signs of positive economic growth in the U.S. and China
improve the outlook for fuel demand. Crude’s gains may sputter
to a halt as prices climb to highs reached earlier this year in
April and May.  “Prices will hit serious resistance in any attempt to
cross the $86.70 barrier,” said Schork Group President  Stephen Schork . Oil climbed to this year’s highest close at $86.84 on
April 6 and reached $86.19 on May 3, followed by sell-offs below
$70, he said.  The November contract was at $81.52 a barrel, down 6 cents,
in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
11:54 a.m. Singapore time after reaching $81.87. It surged $1.61
to settle at $81.58 on Oct. 1, the highest close since Aug. 5,
capping the biggest weekly gain since February.  “The bulls should have enough momentum to hold prices
close to either side of the $80 barrier, thus we expect prices
to trade safely inside our confidence interval,” the Schork
Group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
