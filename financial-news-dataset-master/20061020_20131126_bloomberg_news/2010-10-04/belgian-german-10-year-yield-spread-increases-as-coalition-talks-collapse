Belgian 10-year bond yields rose
relative to similar-maturity benchmark German debt after the
Benelux nation’s Flemish nationalists pulled out of talks to
form a government.  The extra yield, or  spread , that investors demand to hold
the Belgian securities instead of bunds rose 5 basis points to
86 basis points as of 12:03 p.m. in London.  Bart De Wever ’s N-VA party, the top vote-getter in the June
13 election, said it won’t restart seven-party coalition talks
because French-speaking parties refuse to hand more control over
personal income tax to the regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
