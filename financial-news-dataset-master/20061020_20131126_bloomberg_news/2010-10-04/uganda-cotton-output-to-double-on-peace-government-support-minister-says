Cotton production in Uganda may more
than double in the 2010-11 season following an end to conflict
in the main growing region and on increased support for farmers,
Agriculture Minister  Hope Mwesigye  said.  Output in the 12 months through September 2011 may rise to
200,000 185-kilogram (410-pound) bales, from 70,000 bales in
2009-10, she said in an interview today in the capital, Kampala.  Production last season fell from 125,000 bales in 2008-09
after a drought cut yields, the ministry has said. The
government has since increased the amount of cotton seed
distributed to farmers in northern Uganda, which has been
relatively peaceful since rebels from the Lord’s Resistance Army
fled to the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo in 2005
following a government offensive.  “The return of peace is a blessing to the cotton sector
since it is the main growing region,” Mwesigye said. While
farmers in the region rarely use fertilizer, an agreement with
India for chemicals may boost its use, she said.  Most of the 1.8 million displaced persons in northern
Uganda have been resettled in their homes and the remaining
250,000 will leave camps by the first half of next year,
according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  Uganda’s government will allocate 5.7 billion Ugandan
shillings ($2.5 million) to provide seedlings and pesticides to
the industry in the year through June 2011, the Ministry of
Agriculture said on May 19.  Uganda  grows the long-fiber variety of cotton and reaps its
crop from November to April. Output of the fiber has declined
from 500,000 bales in 1971-72 because of political turmoil in
the 1970s until the mid-1980s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
