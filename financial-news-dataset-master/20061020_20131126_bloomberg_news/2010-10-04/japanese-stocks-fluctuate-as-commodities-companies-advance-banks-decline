Japanese  stocks  fell, as concern
banks will need more capital to meet stricter rules dragged an
index of lenders to the lowest level since at least 1983.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s third-biggest bank by
market value, slumped 5.9 percent, the steepest drop in the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
the country’s largest, sank 2.6 percent. Declines accelerated
after a Swiss panel proposed that UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group
AG hold almost twice the capital recommended by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision. Tokyo Electric Power Co.,
Asia’s largest utility, decreased 2.3 percent, extending
declines after the company said last week it will sell new stock.  “The news that UBS and Credit Suisse need to raise capital
further bolstered speculation that major Japanese banks also
need to increase their capital,” said  Hisakazu Amano , who helps
oversee about $29 billion at Tokyo-based T&D Asset Management Co.
“That probably encouraged investors to sell stocks on concern
the value of shares will decline.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.3 percent to 9,381.06
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo after swinging between a gain of
1.1 percent and a drop of 0.5 percent. The broader Topix index
lost 0.9 percent to 822.74, the lowest close since Sept. 8. More
than four times as many shares declined as advanced.  The Nikkei 225 has fallen 11 percent this year as Europe’s
debt crisis, Chinese steps to curb property-price inflation and
concern about the pace of the U.S. economic rebound hurt
confidence in a global recovery. That’s the second-biggest drop
among the world’s 10 largest equity markets. Stocks in the gauge
trade at 16.2 times estimated earnings on average, near the
lowest level since November 2008.  Banks Decline  The Topix Banks Index sank to the lowest level since at
least 1983, when Bloomberg began tracking the data. The index
was the  heaviest drag  on the Topix, accounting for 29 percent of
the index’s drop.  Mitsubishi UFJ lost 2.6 percent to 382 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. dropped 2.9 percent to 2,378 yen, and
Mizuho Financial plunged 5.9 percent to 112 yen, their lowest
closes since 2003. They were the three most-active shares by
value in Japan.  “Stock performance is likely to languish until lingering
concerns that it will be compliant with new Basel regulations
dissipate,”  Graeme Knowd  and  Takaaki Nishino , analysts at
Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., said in a report on Mizuho
dated Sept. 30.  Stricter Capital Rules  The Basel Committee, representing regulators from 27
countries, said Sept. 12 that it will require lenders to have
common equity equal to at least 4.5 percent of assets, weighted
according to their risk. Regulators will introduce an additional
capital buffer of 2.5 percent to withstand future stress.  UBS and Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s two biggest banks,
should hold total capital equal to at least 19 percent of their
assets, compared with 10.5 percent the Basel Committee announced
last month, the Swiss panel said today.  “Renewed concern about stricter capital rules is keeping
bank shares down,” said  Ryuta Otsuka , a strategist in Tokyo at
Toyo Securities Co. “That’s worsening market sentiment.”  Brokerages declined the most in the Topix, and all 21
companies in the industry group dropped.  Nomura Holdings Inc. ,
Japan’s largest brokerage, fell 2.9 percent and Mizuho
Securities Co., the No. 3, sank 3.7 percent.  Yen Moves Exporters  Exporters followed swings in the yen. Sony Corp., an
electronics maker that gets 22 percent of sales in the U.S.,
rose 1.1 percent to 2,565 yen, after gaining as much as 2.4
percent.  Honda Motor Co. , a carmaker that derives almost 85
percent of its sales abroad, increased 0.5 percent to 3,005 yen.
Fanuc Ltd., a maker of industrial robots that earns more than 80
percent of its sales overseas, gained 0.9 percent to 10,740 yen.  The yen weakened to as low as 83.87 against the dollar
today in Tokyo from 83.35 at the 9 a.m. start of trading, before
strengthening to 83.34. Against the euro, it fell to 115.29 from
114.82. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  The Bank of Japan is scheduled to begin a two-day meeting
today and to announce its latest policies tomorrow.  Mitsui & Co., for whom commodities as the biggest source of
profit, increased 1.5 percent to 1,265 yen after Nikko Cordial
Securities Inc. rated the company “outperform” in new coverage.
Mitsui was the biggest support for the Topix, followed by Sony.  Daikin Industries Ltd. , the world’s second-biggest maker of
air conditioners, lost 1.3 percent to 3,075 yen. The company
said first-half net income probably totaled 4 billion yen ($48
million) in the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with its
forecast of 15.5 billion yen, because of writedowns.  Tokyo Electric Power decreased 2.3 percent to 1,996 yen,
the lowest close since September 1985. The company has fallen 13
percent since Sept. 28 on speculation it will sell new stock,
diluting existing shareholders.  The company said Sept. 29 after trading closed that it aims
to raise as much as 555 billion yen ($6.7 billion) by selling
shares. All 17 stocks dropped in the Topix Electric Power & Gas
 Index , which was today’s second-heaviest drag on the Topix
behind banks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
