Elena Kagan  wasted no time joining
the conversation in her first hearing as a  U.S. Supreme Court 
justice.  Kagan, who will take part in only four of the 12 cases
during the court’s first two-week argument session, asked
questions of all three lawyers during the one-hour hearing in a
bankruptcy case that marked the opening of the court’s nine-
month term.  Kagan has recused herself from 24 of the court’s 51
scheduled cases because she played a role in the litigation
while serving as U.S. solicitor general, the government’s top
courtroom advocate.  Today’s hearing focused on whether people seeking
bankruptcy protection can limit the amount they must pay to
creditors by claiming an auto expense deduction for a car that
has already been paid off.  “What would happen if the debtor had a car that was
200,000 miles old and it was going to break down, you know,
within the next five years?” Kagan asked  Deanne Maynard , the
attorney representing  Bank of America Corp.  in the case.  Both Maynard and Nicole Saharsky, the federal government
lawyer in the case, worked under Kagan in the solicitor’s
office.  Kagan sat at the far end of the bench, in the spot assigned
to the most junior justice on the court. She made eye contact
with each speaker and at one point whispered to Justice  Samuel Alito , who was seated to her right. Several of her questions
built off comments and queries from the other justices.  Kagan is the second justice appointed by President  Barack Obama .  The case is Ransom v. FIA Card Services, 09-907.  To contact the reporter on this story:
