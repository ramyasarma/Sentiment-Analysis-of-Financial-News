(Corrects Clement’s title in first paragraph.)  Canadian Industry Minister  Tony Clement  will make an announcement “very shortly” on whether to
extend a government review of  BHP Billiton Ltd. ’s $40 billion
hostile takeover offer for  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.   The industry department is reviewing BHP’s $130-a-share bid
for Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Potash Corp. to determine if
the takeover proposal by Melbourne-based BHP will have “net
benefits” for Canada. The government has until today to review
the bid, unless it extends the review for another 30 days,
according to an Aug. 23 Potash Corp. filing.  “Whether we will or we won’t, we’ll make an announcement
in due course,” Clement said in an interview today in Mirabel,
Quebec. “Obviously, we’re studying the bid very closely. We
will be making our position known very shortly.”  Potash Corp., the world’s largest producer of its namesake
crop nutrient, has rejected BHP’s offer as too low and said it
was expecting competing bids. Clement told reporters Sept. 23
that the deadline had “shifted a little bit” to give the
country’s Competition Bureau more time for its own study.  To contact the reporters on this story:
