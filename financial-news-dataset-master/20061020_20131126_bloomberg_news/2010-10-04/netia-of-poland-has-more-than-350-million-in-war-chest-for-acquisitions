Netia SA , Poland’s second-largest
fixed-line phone operator, said it increased a loan to fund
potential acquisitions to 700 million zloty ($243 million).  BNP Paribas SA, Rabobank Polska SA, Raiffeisen Bank Polska

signed as a 600 million-zloty facility on July 29, Warsaw-based

acquisitions, including more than 300 million zloty of cash,
according to the statement.  Netia climbed 3.2 percent to 5.77 zloty at 10:38 a.m. in
