SK Energy Co.  rose the most in more
than three weeks in Seoul trading after discovering oil in a
field off the coast of Vietnam.  South Korea’s largest refiner  gained  4.5 percent to 150,500
won as of 11:00 a.m. on the Korea Exchange, headed for the
biggest advance since Sept. 10. The benchmark  Kospi  index added
0.5 percent.  “Investors are responding to the discovery news,” said
 Park Dae Yong , a Seoul-based analyst at Hyundai Securities Co.
“It’s still at the exploration stage. Exact reserves need to be
seen though.”  A group of companies that SK Energy is a part of found oil
at the second well of the 15-1/05 block, the Seoul-based refiner
said in a statement yesterday. SK Energy bought a 25 percent
stake in the project in 2007.  Total SA  owns 35 percent and
PetroVietnam Exploration and Production Corp. the rest.  SK Energy, which is participating in 31 projects in 16
countries to secure 500 million barrels of oil, produces 60,000
barrels of crude a day, according to the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
