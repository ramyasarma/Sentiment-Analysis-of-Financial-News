Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s
new economic spending package will be about 4.8 trillion yen
($57.3 billion), National Strategy Minister  Koichiro Gemba  said.  The ruling  Democratic Party of Japan  “will submit a draft
to the government on the 6th,” Gemba, who is also the DPJ’s
policy chief, told reporters today in Tokyo. “If possible, we’d
like the government to finalize the economic stimulus plan this
week.”  The administration is compiling the package, Kan’s second,
to address threats to the economic recovery from a strengthening
currency and persistent deflation. A report today showed
Japanese  wages  unexpectedly failed to rise in August, adding to
concern consumers won’t be able to drive growth.  Kan last week said passing legislation related to the
package is his “top priority.” In an Oct. 1 policy speech to
parliament, he also called on the Bank of Japan to do more to
bolster the economy. The central bank begins a two-day meeting
today, and will probably increase monetary stimulus this month,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists say.  Kan last month unveiled a 915 billion yen stimulus that
government estimates say will create or sustain 200,000 jobs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
