Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd .
Chairwoman Kwong Siu-hing said she reorganized the family trust
that controls the company to make the family of of son Walter
Kwok, rather than Kwok himself, a beneficiary, Hong Kong’s
Standard newspaper said, citing a statement from Kwong.  Kwok said in a statement that he and his family retain a
one-third interest in the trust’s holding in Sun Hung Kai, with
his brothers Thomas and Raymond having the balance, and disputed
that his mother has sole ownership of the Kwok family stake in
the real estate developer, the English-language newspaper
reported today.      To contact the editor responsible for this story:
