Athi River Mining Ltd., a Kenyan
cement maker, aims to boost sales and profit sixfold by 2015,
Deputy Managing Director Surdendra Bhatia said.  The Nairobi-based company wants to focus on cement
production and get out of its lime business, he said at a
conference in Johannesburg today. Athi River is aiming for sales
of $250 million by 2015, Bhatia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
