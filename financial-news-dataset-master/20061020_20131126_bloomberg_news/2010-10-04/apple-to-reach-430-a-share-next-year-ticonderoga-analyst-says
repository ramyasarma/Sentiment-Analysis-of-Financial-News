Apple Inc. , the third-largest company
by market value, will reach $430 a share in the coming 12
months, fueled by rising demand for its iPhones and iPads,
according to a report by Ticonderoga Securities LLC.  The $430-a-share prediction by analyst  Brian White  is the
highest among 37  estimates  tracked by Bloomberg. The gains would
propel Apple’s market value to $392.8 billion, based on the
number of shares outstanding. Apple would be larger than  Exxon
Mobil Corp. , now the biggest company by market capitalization,
valued at $316.7 billion.  Apple has only recently begun benefiting from demand for
smartphones and tablet computing devices, White wrote. The
company is also expanding into new areas such as advertising,
social networking, cloud computing and sales to businesses.
Since introducing the iPhone in  January 2007 , shares have more
than tripled. In June, it released the device’s fourth version.  “Apple has one of the hottest product lineups this holiday
season with the new iPhone 4, which added over 100 new features,
and the iPad, while a refreshed iPod lineup and a new version of
Apple TV could provide extra juice,” White wrote, initiating
coverage of the company.  Apple , based in Cupertino, California, fell $3.88, or 1.4
percent, to $278.64 as of 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading today. The stock has risen 32 percent this year.  The company sold 7.1 million iPads in the fiscal year just
ended, White estimated. He projects that the company to sell
19.9 million iPads in 2011 and 25.8 million in 2012.  Among the risks White cited for Apple are the state of the
economy, competition in smartphones and tablet computers, and
the health of Chief Executive Officer  Steve Jobs .  To contact the reporter on this story:
