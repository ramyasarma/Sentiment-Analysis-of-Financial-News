E.ON AG, Germany’s largest utility,
will start the Oskarshamn-1 atomic reactor in Sweden on Oct. 6
after halting it two days ago, the Dusseldorf-based company said
in a statement distributed by the  Nord Pool ASA  power exchange.  The 473-megawatt power generator was stopped for
maintenance and was initially due to start operating today.  E.ON controls 55 percent of Oskarshamn and Fortum Oyj of
Finland owns the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
