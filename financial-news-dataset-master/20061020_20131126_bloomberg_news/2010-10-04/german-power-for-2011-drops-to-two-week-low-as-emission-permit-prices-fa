German electricity for delivery next
year fell to the lowest level in almost two weeks as prices for
emission permits dropped.  Baseload power for 2011 was down as much as 35 cents at
49.30 euros ($67.60) a megawatt-hour, the lowest price since
Sept. 23, and was at 49.40 euros as of 10:35 a.m. Berlin time,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark
contract in Europe’s biggest power market has declined 4.6
percent this year.  European Union carbon dioxide allowances for December 2010
fell 0.5 percent to 15.29 euros a metric ton as of 10 a.m. in
London. They reached as low as 15.21 euros earlier today. Prices
in Europe’s cap-and-trade program, the world’s largest, are up
22 percent this year.  Germany gets electricity from nuclear, coal, natural gas,
wind and solar sources. Bloomberg tracks power prices from
brokers including GFI Group Inc., ICAP Plc and Spectron Group
Ltd. Baseload power is delivered around the clock.  To contact the reporters on this story:
