Quality Chemical Industries of Uganda
may list its shares in the next three to five years, Chief
Executive Officer Emmanuel Katongole said in a speech at a
conference in Johannesburg today.  The company, 41.8 percent owned by Cipla Ltd. of India,
will make a decision on doubling capacity at its drugs plant in
Uganda by the middle of next year, he said. Quality Chemical,
which makes 2 million tablets a day, will need about $70 million
to build a second plant and possibly a factory to manufacture
active pharmaceutical ingredients it currently imports,
Katongole said.  Quality Chemicals is forecasting sales of $70 million by
2013 and also plans to expand into other East African markets,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
