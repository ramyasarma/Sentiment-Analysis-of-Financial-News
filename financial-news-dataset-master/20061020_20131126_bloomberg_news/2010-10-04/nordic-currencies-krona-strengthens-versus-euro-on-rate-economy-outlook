Sweden’s krona rose versus the euro
before a  report  this week that will probably show industrial
production rose for a sixth consecutive month, fanning
speculation the central bank will raise interest rates.  The krona snapped a two-day decline. The Oct. 8 report may
show industrial production rose 1 percent in August and 17.1
percent year on year, according to a Bloomberg  survey  of at
least four economists. Norway’s krone fell against the dollar
before a report on Oct. 7 that’s forecast to show industrial
production fell in August.  “You have local real-money funds selling euro and buying
the krona,” said  Carl Hammer , the chief currency strategist at
SEB AB in Stockholm. “We’re still expecting continued krona
appreciation.”  The krona appreciated 0.2 percent to 9.2379 per euro as of
1:45 p.m. in Stockholm. It dropped 0.4 percent to 6.7418 per
dollar. The krone fell 0.7 percent to 5.8640 per dollar and
gained 0.2 percent to 8.0253 per euro.  Hammer said the krona was helped by reports last week that
showed Swedish consumer and business confidence surged to the
highest in a decade. The central bank’s own forecast indicates
it will raise its key rate more than 2 percentage points over
the next two years to about 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
