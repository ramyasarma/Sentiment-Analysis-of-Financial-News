The Swiss National Bank is unlikely
to enter the global “devaluation game” because it’s wary of
further franc sales fueling inflation, Schneider Foreign
Exchange said.  “At the very least, strong money-supply growth will make
the SNB very cautious regarding further intervention,”  Stephen Gallo , London-based head of market analysis at Schneider, wrote
in a note today. “So despite the downward trend in headline
CPI, the devaluation toolbox should remain closed unless money
supply growth begins to portend a more deflationary
environment.”  The franc gained 0.9 percent to 1.3313 as of 10:58 a.m. in
London. It dropped 1.6 percent in the third quarter, the first
decline against the 16-nation currency since the three months
through June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
