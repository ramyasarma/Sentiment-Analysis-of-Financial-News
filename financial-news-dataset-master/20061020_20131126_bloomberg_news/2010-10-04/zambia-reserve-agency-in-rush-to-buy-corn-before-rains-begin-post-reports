Zambia’s  Food Reserve Agency  is
spending 150 billion Zambian kwacha ($31 million) a week to buy
corn from farmers to secure the crop before the rainy season
begins, the Lusaka-based  Post  said on its website today, citing
the FRA’s spokeswoman, Mwamba Siame.  The state-owned agency is using its own funds and money
borrowed from banks to pay farmers for their corn, the Post
quoted Siame as saying. She didn’t specify how much money had
been borrowed or which lenders the FRA used, the Post said.  The food agency hopes to have bought all available corn by
the end of October, and expects countries in the region to buy
the grain from Zambia when their own stocks begin to dwindle,
the Post cited the spokeswoman as saying. The agency has spent
306 billion Zambian kwacha on corn this year, the Post reported.  Zambia’s rainy season usually begins in mid-November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
