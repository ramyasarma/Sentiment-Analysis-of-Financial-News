The Institute of International
Finance, an industry group that represents some of the world’s
largest commercial banks and financial firms, said single-
country currency and trade policy moves have hurt the global
economy and threaten its long-term outlook.  “Urgent action is needed to arrest the disturbing trend
towards unilateral moves on macroeconomic, trade and currency
issues,”  Charles Dallara , the group’s managing director, said
in a letter today to  Youssef Boutros-Ghali , who heads the
International Monetary Fund’s steering committee, which meets
this week in Washington.  Dallara highlighted some recent policy decisions as
“essentially counterproductive.” During a press conference in
Washington today, he called on a “core group” of countries to
“come together in a confidential fashion and hammer out an
understanding” on currency exchange and macroeconomic issues.  Japan’s attempt to curb the yen’s appreciation has met with
“only limited success,” he said, and China’s move to limit its
currency’s rise to 1.7 percent since June has triggered U.S.
legislative proposals to retaliate against an undervalued yuan,
Dallara said. He said the U.S., Europe, Japan and China were in
the core group that needed to cooperate.  The group’s letter comes ahead of a series of meetings this
month that will bring U.S., European and Asian leaders together
to discuss economic policies and financial stability. The Group
of 20 nations is leading an effort to toughen bank supervision
and encourage global economic rebalancing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
