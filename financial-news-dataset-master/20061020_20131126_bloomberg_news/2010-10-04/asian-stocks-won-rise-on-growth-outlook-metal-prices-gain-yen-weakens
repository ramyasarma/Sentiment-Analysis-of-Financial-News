Asian shares and emerging market
currencies strengthened on speculation developing economies will
maintain growth even as U.S. and Europe slow. The yen weakened,
boosting earnings prospects for Japanese exporters.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.7 percent to 127.91 as
of 11:50 a.m. in Tokyo. South Korea’s won rose for a sixth day,
its longest winning streak in eight weeks, after the nation’s
foreign-exchange reserves rose to a record. The yen sank to more
than four-month low versus the euro and copper traded near a
two-year high. Standard & Poor’s 500 futures were up 0.1 percent.  China’s non-manufacturing industries expanded at a faster
pace in September data showed yesterday, while the nation’s
Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in an interview broadcast over the
weekend his nation needs to do more to stimulate domestic demand.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse Holdings USA Inc. and
BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research are among companies that
expect global growth will withstand a slowdown in the U.S.  “China’s economic growth looks robust,” said  Yuji Saito ,
director of the foreign-exchange department at Credit Agricole
Corporate and Investment Bank in Tokyo. “This is positive for
risk-taking appetite. The bias is for the yen to be sold.”  More than three shares rose for each that declined on the
 MSCI Asia Pacific Index . Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
climbed 0.9 percent, and South Korea’s Kospi index increased 0.6
percent. Markets in China and parts of Australia are closed
today for holidays.  Hyundai Sales  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s No. 1 mining company,
increased 1.6 percent in Sydney. Hyundai Motor Co., South
Korea’s largest automaker, climbed 2.2 percent after its U.S.
sales rose to a record in September. Honda Motor Co., which gets
46 percent of sales from North America, rose 1.5 percent.  The yen fell to 83.69 per dollar in Tokyo from 83.22 in New
York on Oct. 1. The yen was at 115.22 per euro, the weakest
since May 18, from 114.78 in New York. The euro dipped to
$1.3767 from $1.3791 after rising to $1.3807 earlier today, the
strongest level since March 17.  The China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
yesterday its purchasing managers’ index increased to 61.7 in
September from 60.1 in August. Numbers above 50 indicate an
expansion and below 50 a contraction. Wen, in an interview with
CNN that was taped on Sept. 23, said his nation “can rely on
stimulating domestic demand to stabilize and further grow the
Chinese economy.”  Korea Reserves  Goldman Sachs predicts worldwide growth will slow 0.2
percentage point to 4.6 percent in 2011, even as expansion in
the U.S. falls to 1.8 percent from 2.6 percent. South Korea’s
currency climbed to a four-month high after a central bank
report showed the  reserves  increased $4.4 billion to $289.8
billion last month. The won reached 1,123.95 to the dollar, the
strongest level since May 5.  “Increasing foreign-exchange reserves means there are more
dollars coming into the country,” said  Yun Se Min , a Seoul-
based currency trader at Busan Bank. “That means more dollars
are being exchanged for won, which is a factor that strengthens
the local currency.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to NT$31.003.  Copper for three-month delivery advanced 0.5 percent to
$8,138 per metric ton and traded near its highest level in 26
months on the London Metal Exchange. Rubber for March delivery
gained as much as 0.8 percent to 318.20 yen ($3.80) per kilogram
in Tokyo, the highest level for the most active contract since
April, and traded at 314.30 yen.  U.S. Data  U.S. data this week point to slowing growth, even as the
nation’s equities come off the biggest September rally since the
Great Depression. Orders placed with U.S. factories declined 0.4
percent in August, the third drop in four months, according to
the median estimate of economists ahead of today’s Commerce
Department report. Unemployment climbed to 9.7 percent last
month, according another survey showed before the Labor
Department’s Oct. 8 report.  Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell two basis points to
2.50 percent in Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data.  The U.S. Federal Reserve “will do more quantitative
easing,” said Zeal Yin, an investor at Shin Kong Life Insurance
Co. in Taipei, Taiwan’s second-largest life insurer with the
equivalent of $47.6 billion in assets. “Every asset will go up,
especially Treasuries. I’m bullish on Treasuries, corporate
bonds and emerging-market government bonds.”  To contact the reporters for this story:
