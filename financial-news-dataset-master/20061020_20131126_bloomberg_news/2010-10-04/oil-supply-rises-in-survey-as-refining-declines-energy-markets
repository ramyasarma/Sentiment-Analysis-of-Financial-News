U.S. oil  supplies  probably rose last
week as refineries undergoing seasonal maintenance cut their
processing rates to the lowest level since April, reducing
demand for crude, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Stockpiles gained 413,000 barrels from 357.9 million,
according to the median of 14 analyst estimates before an Energy
Department report tomorrow. Gasoline stocks were little changed
in the survey and distillates fell.  Oil prices climbed above $80 a barrel after the Energy
Department last week reported declines in supplies of gasoline
and distillate, including heating oil and diesel. Oil stocks
were 13 percent higher than the five-year average in the week
ended Sept. 24.  “We’re in the heart of maintenance season, so we’d expect
a little bit of an increase in crude and a little bit of a drop
in products,” said  Phil Flynn , a Chicago-based analyst and
trader with investment adviser PFGBest. “Refinery runs are
going to continue to be low.”  The American Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that
U.S. crude-oil stockpiles increased 4.44 million barrels, or 1.2
percent, last week to 366.1 million.  Refineries probably operated  at 85.4 percent of capacity,
down 0.5 percentage point from the previous week, according to
the Bloomberg survey. That would be the lowest level since the
seven days ended April 2.  Rates  dropped 2 percentage points in
the week ended Sept. 24, compared with a forecast decline of 0.6
percentage point.  Nine analysts forecast oil supplies increased last week,
four projected a decline and one said there would be no change.  Oil Imports  Oil inventories decreased 475,000 barrels in the week ended
Sept. 24 as  imports  tumbled 3.4 percent to 9 million barrels a
day, the lowest level since Sept. 3.  “There’s a little bit of room for an uptick in crude-oil
imports, in particular with Enbridge restarting some of their
pipeline capacity,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst with Citi
Futures Perspective in New York. Refinery maintenance work can
make it easier to increase inventories, he said.  Enbridge Energy Partners LP  said Sept. 27 that it had begun
the “gradual restart” of its Line 6B, which was shut down
after a rupture July 26 spilled 19,500 barrels of oil near
Marshall, Michigan. The line can carry 290,000 barrels a day of
heavy crude oil from Griffith, Indiana, to Sarnia, Ontario.  The closure reduced heavy crude supplies for refineries in
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Ontario.  BP Plc  and United Refining Co.
were forced to pare production after the pipeline was shut.  Enbridge started its 6A oil pipeline, the largest conduit
linking Canada and the U.S. Midwest, on Sept. 17 after a leak in
Illinois on Sept. 9 shut the line.  Petroleum Supplies  Oil for November delivery jumped $1.35, or 1.7 percent, to
$82.82 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since May 3. Prices declined from the close after the
API report. Crude rose $1.06, or 1.3 percent, to $82.53 a barrel
in electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  U.S. stockpiles  of oil and fuel fell 5.1 million barrels in
the seven days ended Sept. 24 from a record 1.14 billion the
prior week. The Sept. 17 figure was the highest level since at
least 1990, when the Energy Department began to collect weekly
data.  “We’re desperately trying to put lipstick on this pig,”
said  Bill O’Grady , chief market strategist at Confluence
Investment Management in St. Louis. “These supply and
consumption fundamentals are still pretty stinky.”  U.S.  gasoline inventories  probably fell 250,000 barrels in
the seven days ended Oct. 1 from 222.6 million. Fifteen analysts
provided product estimates. Eight forecast supplies declined,
six said they rose and one estimated no change.  Strengthening Exports  Gasoline supplies tumbled 3.47 million barrels in the
previous week, the biggest drop since the week ended Oct. 9,
2009, as  demand for the motor fuel  increased by 6.1 percent, the
largest amount since February. Inventories were forecast to rise
350,000 barrels. Stockpiles were 13 percent above the five-year
average.  “Demand for products should continue to stay strong if not
stronger,” said  Carl Larry , president of Oil Outlooks &
Opinions LLC in Houston. “This also might be the week where we
see exports start to show a little more strength, and that could
take more out of the product inventory.”  Total fuel  exports  averaged a record 2.16 million barrels a
day for a third straight week in the seven days ended Sept. 24,
according to the Energy Department.  Oil prices in September posted their biggest monthly gain
since May 2009 and gasoline jumped the most since March as
unemployment and gross domestic product reports signaled that
the economy is growing and will boost demand for fuels.  Distillate Fuel  Gasoline for November delivery rose 3.22 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $2.1255 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
closing price since Aug. 5.  Stockpiles  of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, probably dropped 1 million barrels, or
0.6 percent, from 173.6 million. All 15 respondents in the
survey forecast a decline.  Inventories in the week ended Aug. 20 were the most since
1983. They were 22 percent above the five-year average in the
week ended Sept. 24. Supplies have fallen in four of the past
five weekly reports.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
