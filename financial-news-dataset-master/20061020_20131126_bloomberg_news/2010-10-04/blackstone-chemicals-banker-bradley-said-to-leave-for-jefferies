Blackstone Group LP’s  David Bradley ,
head of the unit that advises chemicals companies on mergers, is
departing for  Jefferies Group Inc. , said two people with
knowledge of the matter.  Bradley plans to join Jefferies early next year as global
head of industrials, said one of the people, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the move hasn’t been announced
yet. He has worked in the advisory unit at New York-based
 Blackstone , the world’s largest buyout firm, since last year.  Jefferies has been hiring bankers from bigger competitors,
adding  Frank Cicero  from Barclays Plc this year to run its
global financial institutions group, and hiring a team of
health-care bankers led by  Benjamin Lorello  from UBS AG last
year. Since January, the New York-based firm has announced the
hiring of at least 20 investment bankers from rivals.  Mary Ann Ranalli, a Jefferies spokeswoman, and  Peter Rose ,
a Blackstone spokesman, declined to comment. Reached by phone at
his office today, Bradley declined to comment.  Jefferies’ current head of industrials,  Sean Sullivan , will
remain with the firm, one of the people with knowledge of the
matter said.  Bradley advised Bain Capital LLC on the $1.7 billion
acquisition of Dow Chemical Co.’s Styron unit in June, and
counseled MatlinPatterson Global Advisers LLC’s Polymer Group
Inc. on its agreement, announced today, to sell itself to a
Blackstone private-equity fund.  Before joining Blackstone, Bradley worked at UBS AG and at
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
