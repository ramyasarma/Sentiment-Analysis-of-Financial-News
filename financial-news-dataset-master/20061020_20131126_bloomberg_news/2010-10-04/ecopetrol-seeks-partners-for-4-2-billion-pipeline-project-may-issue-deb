Ecopetrol SA, Colombia’s biggest oil
producer, said it is seeking partners to help build a $4.2
billion pipeline to carry crude to the nation’s northern coast.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp.  and Petrominerales Ltd.,
which produce crude in Colombia, are among companies interested
in the project, known as the Bicentennial Pipeline, Ecopetrol
Chief Financial Officer  Adriana Echeverri  said said today at an
event at the New York Stock Exchange.  Ecopetrol is investing in infrastructure as it seeks to
more than double production to 1.3 million barrels a day by
2020. Transport capacity has lagged behind increases in output
in Colombia, South America’s third-largest crude producer after
Venezuela and Brazil,  Mauricio Restrepo , an analyst at Medellin-
based brokerage Bolsa & Renta, said by telephone on Sept. 30.  The pipeline unit may sell debt once construction is
finished, Echeverri said. The pipeline will be built in stages
beginning as soon as this year and may be completed in 2012,
according to a company presentation distributed today at the New
York Stock Exchange.  Ecopetrol  also may sell stock equal to a 9.9 percent stake
in 2011 or 2012, depending on financing needs, Chief Executive
Officer  Javier Gutierrez  told reporters today.  Ecopetrol slipped 5 pesos, or 0.1 percent, to 3,720 pesos
at 11 a.m. in Bogota. The company has rallied 50 percent this
year, outpacing a 28 percent gain in the benchmark Colcap index.  Ecopetrol produced 594,000 barrels of crude a day in June,
according to the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
