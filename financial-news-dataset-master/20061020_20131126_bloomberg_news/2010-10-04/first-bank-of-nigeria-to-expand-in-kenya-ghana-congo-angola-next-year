First Bank of Nigeria Plc plans to
start expanding in Kenya, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo
and Angola next year, said Oluyemisi Lanre-Phillips, head of
investor relations.  The company also plans to open representative offices in
Dubai and New York, Lanre-Phillips said in a speech in
Johannesburg today. First Bank wants to expand financial
services outside of banking internationally in 2013, Lanre-
Phillips said. The lender’s joint venture with Sanlam Ltd., a
South African insurer, should start this quarter, Lanre-Phillips
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
