U.S. households’ natural gas bills
may rise by about 7 percent this winter amid increased demand
for the fuel, the American Gas Association said.  “We expect natural gas demand to be growing, some of that
coming from the industrial sector,” Christopher McGill, the
association’s managing director of policy analysis, told
reporters in Washington today.  The association, which represents companies that deliver
natural gas, including  Xcel Energy Inc.  and  DTE Energy Co. , said
in a report that the expected increase in natural-gas heating
bills is based on U.S. Energy Information Administration
projections.  Natural gas prices have been a “little higher” this year
than in 2009 and there is “not quite as much storage today as
there was at this point last year,” McGill said.  Still, the anticipated supply of natural gas is “very
strong” and temperatures this winter are expected to be “about
the same” as during the last heating season, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
