Zain, the Kuwaiti phone company that
received an offer from Emirates Telecommunications Corp. for a
46 percent stake, was cut to “underweight” at HSBC Holdings
Plc.   “Minority shareholders have nothing to gain from it with
potential dividends at risk,” analysts Kunal Bajaj and Raj
Sinha wrote in a note to investors today. “Saudi Arabian
operations may prove to be a stumbling block to the deal.”  HSBC maintained its price estimate at 1.23 Kuwaiti dinars.
The shares were cut from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
