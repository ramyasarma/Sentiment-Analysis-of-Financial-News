TMX Group Inc. , owner of the Toronto
Stock Exchange, plans to start an alternative trading platform
to compete with Alpha Trading Systems and other companies that
have taken market share from Canada’s biggest bourse.  TMX aims to establish a platform with expanded hours for
trading stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture
Exchange, the company said today in a statement. TMX plans to
start the platform, called TMX Select, in the second quarter of
2011 pending regulatory approval, said  Kevan Cowan , group head
of equities.  “We’ve got a rapidly evolving marketplace and the best way
for us to serve our customers is to offer options,” Cowan said
in an interview. “This marketplace will offer distinct pricing
and functionality than our existing markets.”  Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange have lost
market share to alternative trading systems that have emerged in
Canada since 2007. TMX’s two exchanges had about 73 percent of
the Canadian market for equity trading in August, down from 98
percent two years ago.  The bank-owned Alpha, TMX’s biggest rival, gained nearly 19
percent of the marketplace in August, almost two years after it
started. Other rivals include Pure Trading, the three-year-old
system that has 2 percent of the market, and Chi-X Canada, with
4.7 percent share, according to statistics from the Investment
Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada  TMX fell 13 cents to C$31.46 at 4 p.m. trading on the
Toronto Stock Exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
