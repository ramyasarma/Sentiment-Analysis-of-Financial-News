Asian currencies traded near the
highest level in two years on speculation China’s plan to boost
domestic demand and spur economic growth will support orders for
regional exports.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, traded at
114.86 today from 115.02 on Oct. 1, when it reached 115.09, the
highest level since July 2008. South Korea’s won climbed 0.7
percent to 1,122.35 per dollar as of 3 p.m. in Seoul and touched
1,122.30, the strongest since May, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Philippine peso rose 0.4 percent to 43.715 and
Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.2 percent to NT$31.25.  A gauge of non-manufacturing businesses in China issued
yesterday climbed the most in four months in September, while a
similar measure last week covering factory production beat
estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Overseas
investors are pumping funds into the region as Asia leads the
global recovery, with growth set to outpace Europe and the U.S.
this year.  “The better Chinese data and the increase in their
domestic demand means exports from Asia to China may expand,
boosting regional currencies,” said  Tohru Nishihama , an
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo.  The non-manufacturing purchasing managers’  index  released
by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing rose to 61.7
from 60.1 in August. China will stabilize its economy by
increasing domestic demand, Premier Wen Jiabao said in an
interview with CNN broadcast yesterday. The country is the top
export destination for South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.  Korea Reserves  Overseas investors have pumped a net $33.9 billion into
Indian, South Korean and Taiwanese equities this year, according
to exchange data. Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.2
percent in 2010, outpacing growth of 2.6 percent in advanced
countries, the International Monetary Fund forecast in July.  The won rose for a sixth day, its longest winning streak in
eight weeks, after a central bank report showed foreign-exchange
 reserves  increased $4.4 billion to $289.8 billion last month.
The holdings can cover three months of imports or settle short-
term debt and so are sufficient to cope with any crisis, the
finance ministry said today in a report, adding that it is
prepared to intervene to combat volatility.  “Increasing foreign-exchange reserves means there are more
dollars coming into the country,” said  Yun Se Min , a Seoul-
based currency trader at Busan Bank. “That means more dollars
are being exchanged for won, which is a factor that strengthens
the local currency.”  Ringgit Pauses  Taiwan’s dollar reached a two-year high of NT$30.976 ahead
of a government report this week that economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predict will show  exports  increased for an 11th month
in September, the best run of gains in two years.  Malaysia’s ringgit retreated from a 13-year high as
technical indicators signaled a pause in a rally that’s made the
currency Asia’s best performer of 2010. The ringgit fell for the
first time in seven days after its relative strength index ended
last week near a threshold that suggests a change of direction
is likely. The currency dropped 0.2 percent to 3.0895.  Elsewhere, the Thai baht gained 0.1 percent to 30.17 and
earlier reached a 13-year high of 30.08, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Singapore dollar and the Indonesian
rupiah were little changed at S$1.3133 and 8,926.  To contact the reporter on this story:
