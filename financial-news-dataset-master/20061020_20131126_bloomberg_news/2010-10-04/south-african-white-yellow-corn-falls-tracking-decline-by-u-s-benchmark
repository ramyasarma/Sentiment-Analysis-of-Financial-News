Corn fell in South Africa, the
largest producer of the grain on the continent, tracking a
decline in Chicago prices, a global benchmark.  December-delivery corn lost as much as 2.5 percent to
$4.5425 a bushel, the lowest level since Sept. 3, on the Chicago
Board of Trade and was at $4.59 at 9:12 a.m. in Johannesburg.
The contract tumbled 30 cents on Oct. 1, the maximum allowed.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, dropped 60 rand, or 4.8
percent, to 1,192 rand ($172) a metric ton. Meal made from the
grain is the country’s staple food.  Yellow corn for December delivery fell 59 rand, or 4.4
percent, to 1,284 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa.  Wheat for December delivery lost 58 rand, or 2.2 percent,
to 2,570 rand a ton.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
