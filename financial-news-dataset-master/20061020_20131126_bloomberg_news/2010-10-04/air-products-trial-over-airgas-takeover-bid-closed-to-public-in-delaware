Air Products & Chemicals Inc. 
persuaded a Delaware judge to close a trial over its bid to
force rival Airgas Inc. to consider a $5.5 billion hostile
takeover bid.  Delaware Chancery Court Judge  William B. Chandler  III
granted a request by Air Products to close the courtroom  during
testimony by Chief Financial Officer  Paul Huck . The courtroom
remained closed for about 10 minutes today while he testified
about Airgas’s value to Air Products, the second-biggest U.S.
industrial-gases producer behind  Praxair Inc.   Air Products , based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, sued
Airgas, based in Radnor, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 4, saying it
violated legal duties to shareholders by rebuffing the $65.50 a
share offer.  As part of the case, Airgas is asking Chandler to
invalidate a bylaw approved by shareholders in a Sept. 15 vote
that added three Air Products nominees to the  Airgas board .  The cases are Air Products & Chemicals Inc. v. Airgas Inc.,
5249, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington); and Airgas Inc. v.
Air Products & Chemicals Inc., 5817, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
