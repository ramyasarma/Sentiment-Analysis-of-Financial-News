Shinsei Bank Ltd.  shares gained in
Tokyo trading after Credit Suisse Group AG raised the lender’s
rating to “outperform” from “neutral” on the company’s plan
for reduced credit costs and expenses.  Shinsei rose as much as 6.9 percent to 62 yen and traded at
60 yen as of 10:27 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Japan’s
Topix Banks Index fell 1.2 percent.  The Japanese lender partly owned by J.  Christopher Flowers ,
on Sept. 28 raised its net income target for the fiscal year
ending March 2013 to 51 billion yen ($610 million) from 32
billion yen. Credit Suisse attributed the rating increase partly
to the bank’s measures to cut expenses and lower credit costs,
analyst  Shinichi Ina  said in his Oct. 1 note.  Credit costs will be 49 billion yen, 14 billion yen lower
than an earlier forecast, as it reduces its consumer finance
related assets. While credit costs are forecasts to wane,
Shinsei said revenue for the period will be 258 billion yen, 7
billion yen less than its previous forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
