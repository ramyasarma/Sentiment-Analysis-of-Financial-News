U.K. stocks gained, sending the FTSE
100 Index to its biggest rally in two weeks, as U.S. service
industries expanded more than forecast, travel companies surged
and Japan pledged more aid to stimulate its economy.  British Airways Plc posted the biggest advance on the
benchmark  FTSE 100  after passenger traffic rose last month by
the most in more than two years.  TUI Travel Plc  rose 4.2 percent
as Europe’s largest tour operator said bookings for the winter
had strengthened.  Inmarsat Plc  sank 4 percent after  Philip Falcone ’s Harbinger Capital Partners said it will sell part of
its holding and won’t make an offer for the rest of the company.  The FTSE 100 climbed 79.79, or 1.4 percent, to 5,635.76 at
the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in London. The measure has
rallied 17 percent since this year’s low in July as investors
speculated that the world economy will avoid another recession
even as European governments slash spending and U.S. growth
slows. The  FTSE All-Share Index  advanced 1.4 percent today and
Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  rose 1.2 percent.  “Sentiment was given a boost by the news out overnight”
from Japan, said Nick Serff, a markets analyst at City Index
Ltd. in London. “Naturally investors in Europe will now look to
the Bank of England and the Fed to toe a similar line to
maintain fragile economic growth.”  Japan’s central bank cut its benchmark interest rate and
said it will create a 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) fund to buy
government bonds and other assets to support the economy.  ISM Data  In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s index of
non-manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of
the world’s largest economy, rose to 53.2 from 51.5 in August.
The gauge, where readings greater than 50 signal growth,
averaged 55.3 during the six-year expansion that ended in
December 2007. The median forecast of 76 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected the ISM index would rise to 52.  British Airways climbed 6.5 percent to 254.6 pence after
saying passenger traffic rose last month for the first time
since February as bookings to Europe and the Middle East surged
and the threat of strikes receded.  Last month’s rebound was led by a 4.3 percent increase in
first- and business-class traffic, British Airways said, with
demand gaining 0.7 percent in coach. Yields, a measure of
average ticket prices, were “strong” across the cabin, it
said.  TUI Travel  TUI Travel  surged 4.2 percent to 225.9 pence. The travel
company said in a statement today that bookings for winter
2010/2011 have “further strengthened,” and that full-year
results will be “in line with previous guidance.” Net debt is
expected to be lower than guidance, the company said.  The TUI Travel statement is “encouraging,”  Johannes Braun , an analyst at  Commerzbank AG  in Frankfurt, wrote in a
report today. “September bookings seem to have been better than
expected, which is encouraging after its recent warning that
austerity measures, especially in the U.K., would affect tourism
demand.”  Inmarsat lost 4 percent to 629 pence. Falcone’s Harbinger
Capital sold 65 million ordinary shares of Inmarsat, or 14.1
percent of the company, for 410 million pounds.  Computacenter Plc , which supplies computer services to  BT
Group Plc  and  BAE Systems Plc , climbed 7.6 percent to 322.9
pence, leading rising shares on the FTSE 250 Index. Investec
Securities upgraded the shares to “buy” from “hold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
