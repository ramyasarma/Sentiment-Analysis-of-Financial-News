Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. , a unit of  Anglo
American Plc , reached a pay agreement with South Africa’s
National Union of Mineworkers in an effort to end a strike that
started today.  The union will now consult its members over the accord,
Kumba spokesman  Gert Schoeman  said by mobile phone. Details of
the settlement will only be released when members accept the
offer, he said.  Kumba’s Sishen mine in the country’s Northern Cape province
provides most of the ore needs of ArcelorMittal South Africa
Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest steelmaker. The company
supplies about 70 percent of South Africa’s steel.  The NUM, which represents all 6,500 of Kumba’s employees,
is demanding pay increases of between 7.5 percent for the
highest-paid workers and 10 percent for the lowest-paid, union
spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said earlier.  South Africa’s inflation slowed to 3.5 percent in August,
aided by the rand’s surge against the dollar, which has cut
import prices and helped to offset rising costs.  Kumba fell 6.63 rand, or 1.8 percent, to 362.32 rand by the
5 p.m. close in Johannesburg trading, reducing the company’s
market value to 116.5 billion rand ($16.6 billion). Anglo owns
63 percent of the  shares , which have advanced 19 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
