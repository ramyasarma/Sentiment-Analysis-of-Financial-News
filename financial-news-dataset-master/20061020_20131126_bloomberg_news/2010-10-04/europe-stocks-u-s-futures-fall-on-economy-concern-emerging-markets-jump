U.S.  stocks  fell, pushing the Dow
Jones Industrial Average to its biggest retreat in a month, as
analyst ratings cuts and a drop in American factory orders
spurred concern before the start of the earnings season. Two-
year Treasury yields declined to a record.  The Dow lost 78.41 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,751.27 at
4 p.m. in New York, the most since Sept. 7. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.8 percent to 1,137.03. The yield on
the two-year Treasury note  fell  to as low as 0.3987 percent. The
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index  added 0.3 percent to the  highest  
level since June 2008.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. removed “buy” ratings on
 Microsoft Corp. , J.C. Penney Co. and Macy’s Inc., while Deutsche
Bank AG put  Alcoa Inc.  on its short-term “sell” list before
the largest U.S. aluminum company starts the third-quarter
earnings season on Oct. 7. Analysts are cutting forecasts for
S&P 500 profits for the first time in more than a year as the
economic rebound slows, jeopardizing the largest September rally
since 1939.  “There’s some fear the soft patches we hit in the economy
over the summer are going to be reflected in corporate
earnings,” said  Art Hogan , chief market analyst at New York-
based Jefferies Group Inc. “That’s where we’re getting some of
the caution that’s manifested today. Some of the department
store names were downgraded. We had a great September and people
are nervous we’re coming into an  earnings season  with irrational
exuberance.”  Factory Orders  Manufacturing orders in the U.S. declined 0.5 percent in
August, following a revised 0.5 percent increase a month earlier
and exceeding the median estimate of a 0.4 percent drop from 64
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The decline added to the  S&P 500 ’s drop last week, its
biggest since August. Stocks fluctuated earlier as weaker-than-
expected factory orders overshadowed a separate report from the
National Association of Realtors showing contracts to purchase
previously owned homes climbed 4.3 percent, rising for a second
month and suggesting the U.S. housing market is stabilizing.  Estimates for S&P 500 companies’ combined 2011 profit fell
as low as $95.17 a share last month from an August high of
$96.16 and posted the first quarterly reduction since the three
months ended June 2009, according to more than 8,500 forecasts
tracked by Bloomberg.  The revision came even as the benchmark gauge for U.S.
equities rose 8.8 percent last month, the biggest September
 advance  since 1939.  Earnings Season  Alcoa, which kicks off the earnings season on Oct. 7, fell
2.5 percent to $11.92. Monsanto Co. and Costo Wholesale Corp.
will also report earnings this week.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped for a sixth day,
slipping 0.5 percent in its longest  losing streak  since January
2009.  Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG led automakers to the biggest
decline in the Stoxx 600 as German new-car sales tumbled 18
percent in September. Gas Natural SDG SA lost 3.6 percent after
saying a ruling related to a dispute with Algeria’s Sonatrach
may cut profit by as much as 450 million euros ($619 million).  The  MSCI China Index  of Hong Kong-traded shares advanced
1.5 percent after a September purchasing managers’ index
released yesterday rose to 61.7 from 60.1 in August and Premier
 Wen Jiabao  said the nation will stimulate domestic demand.
Benchmark equity indexes in the  Philippines  and Indonesia
advanced to records. Local Chinese exchanges were closed for a
holiday.  ‘Emerging Markets Is Answer’  “If you look for yield and you look for return, the answer
is emerging markets,”  Philip Poole , the global head of macro
and investment strategy at HSBC Global Asset Management, which
oversees more than $400 billion, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television’s “On The Move” with Francine Lacqua in
London.  The euro weakened against all but 2 of its 16 most-traded
peers. The common European currency depreciated 0.8 percent to
$1.3687, snapping a four-day gain, and declined 0.6 percent
against the yen to 114.10 yen. The Dollar Index, which tracks
the U.S. currency against those of six major trading partners,
advanced 0.5 percent, rebounding from its lowest level since
January reached on Oct. 1.  The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined 4
basis points to 2.47 percent, while the similar-maturity U.K.
gilt yield  dropped  4 basis points to 2.93 percent. The 10-year
Greek yield slid 15 basis points to 10 percent. China plans to
buy the nation’s bonds once Greece begins tapping international
markets for funding again, Wen said two days ago. The extra
yield investors demand to hold Greek 10-year debt instead of
benchmark German bunds narrowed 10 basis points to 775 basis
points today.  Hogs, Sugar  Hog futures slipped to the lowest level since February on
signs that U.S. pork supplies are outpacing demand. Hogs for
December delivery lost 1.3 percent to 71.9 cents a pound on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, after touching 71.75 cents, the
lowest price for a most-active contract since Feb. 25. The
commodity has climbed 10 percent this year.  Raw sugar futures fell for a fourth day, capping the
longest slide since May, as concern eased that drought will
damage crops in Brazil, the world’s biggest producer. Sugar for
March settlement lost 1.6 percent to 22.99 cents a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York.  Wheat futures declined 1.2 percent to settle at $6.4725 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade as rains in Russia and
Eastern Europe improved the prospects for drought-strapped
fields where famers are planting winter crops. The grain dropped
for a sixth session, the longest losing streak in four months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
