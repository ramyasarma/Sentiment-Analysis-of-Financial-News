Chinese inssurance companies may
invest in the Hong Kong initial public offering of AIA Group
Ltd., the South China Morning Post reported, citing Christopher
Cheung, chairman of Christfund Securities Ltd.  Mainland insurers are interested in AIG because Asia’s
life-insurance market is the fastest growing, the Hong Kong-
based English-language newspaper said today. The Kuwait
Investment Authority will invest $1 billion in the sale, the
Post said, citing unidentified brokers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
