European Union Trade Commissioner
 Karel De Gucht  said the undervaluation of China’s yuan poses a
“real problem” while expressing doubts about the ability of
the EU and the U.S. to influence Chinese foreign-exchange
policy.  “There is a real problem with the value of the Chinese
currency,” De Gucht said in a Bloomberg Television interview
today in Brussels. “I have my doubts whether you can influence
that by international pressure.”  He added: “I continue to believe that over time the
Chinese currency will appreciate, but this will rather be I
think on the basis of internal requirements than international
pressure, mainly for example the risk that they would get into
an inflationary spiral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
