French defense electronics company
 Safran SA  is supplying technology for the first phase of India’s
project to give unique identification numbers, supported by
biometric data, to its 1.2 billion people, Les Echos said.  Safran’s Morpho unit is working with one of the three
consortiums retained by the Unique Identification Authority of
India. It is setting up verifiable identification including for
those so poor they don’t have birth certificates or other proof
of identity, the paper said.  Morpho supplied the systems for a demonstration last week
for Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  and Congress Party President
 Sonia Gandhi . Inhabitants of the village of Tembhali became the
first Indians to get their numbers and enroll their digital
fingerprints and iris scans in the database, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
