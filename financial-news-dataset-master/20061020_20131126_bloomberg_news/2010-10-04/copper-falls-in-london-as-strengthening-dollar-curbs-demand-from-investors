Copper prices fell the most in three
weeks as the dollar rebounded, reducing the appeal of
commodities as alternative investments.  The  greenback  rose as much as 0.6 percent against a basket
of six major currencies. Copper has gained 27 percent since July
1 as inventories dropped and the dollar slumped. On Oct. 1, the
metal reached $3.722 a pound in New York, the highest level
since July 30, 2008.  “Copper is floating a little on the stronger dollar,”
said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage
Services in Chicago. “We’re seeing some technical profit-
taking.”  Copper futures for December delivery slid 2.65 cents, or
0.7 percent, to close at $3.664 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the
Comex, the biggest loss for a most-active contract since Sept.
10.  Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange rose for
the first time in six sessions. Orders to withdraw copper from
inventories slid for the ninth straight session, the longest
slump since May 11.  The metal may resume its rally, reaching $3.80 in eight to
10 days, McGhee said. Demand in China, the world’s largest
consumer, is “underpinning the market,” he said.  In London, copper for delivery in three months dropped $36,
or 0.4 percent, to $8,064 a metric ton ($3.66 a pound).  Lead also fell on the LME. Aluminum, nickel and tin rose,
while zinc was little changed.  To contact the reporters on the story:
