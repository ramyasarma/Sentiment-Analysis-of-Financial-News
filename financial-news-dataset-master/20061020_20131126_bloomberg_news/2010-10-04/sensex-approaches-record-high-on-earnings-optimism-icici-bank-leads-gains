India’s stocks advanced, with the
benchmark index approaching a record high, amid speculation an
expanding economy will boost corporate earnings.  ICICI Bank Ltd., the nation’s second-biggest lender,
climbed to a 31-month high, after it was raised to
“overweight” from “neutral” at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which
said recent macroeconomic news has been “supportive.”  JSW
Steel Ltd.  reached a record after raising prices of the alloy.
Overseas investors were net Indian equity buyers for a 22nd day.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
added 30.69, or 0.2 percent, to 20,475.73, nearing its record
closing high of 20,873.33 on Jan. 8, 2008. The gauge had earlier
climbed as much as 1.3 percent. The Sensex is the best performer
this year among the world’s 10 biggest stock markets.  “The rally has been a surprise and has been led by foreign
investors who are betting on the India growth story,” said
 Aneesh Srivastava , the Mumbai-based chief investment officer at
IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co., who manages about $325 million
in assets. “We expect the corporate earnings in the September
quarter to be better than the previous quarter. Investors are on
tenterhooks as the Sensex is approaching a lifetime high.”  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.3 percent to 6,159.45, near its record of 6,287.85 on the same
day in January 2008. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.4 percent to
2,590.74.  ICICI Bank  climbed 1.9 percent to 1156.15 rupees, the
highest since February 2008.  JSW Steel increased 1.6 percent to 1,392 rupees, the
highest since its listing in May 1995.  Steel Authority of India
Ltd.  gained 0.4 percent to 224.35 rupees, paring an earlier
advance of as much as 2.1 percent. The companies raised prices
of the alloy by as much as 3 percent starting on Oct. 1, JSW
Marketing Director  Jayant Acharya  and Steel Authority Chairman
 C.S. Verma  said in separate telephone interviews that day.  Tata Motors  Tata Motors Ltd. , the biggest truckmaker and owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, advanced 2.2 percent to 1,139.05 rupees, the
highest in at least 19 years after pledging to cut debt. The
maker of the world’s cheapest car, the Nano, raised $750 million
from a sale of shares to institutional investors, said three
people with direct knowledge of the matter. The deal, which
started on Oct. 1, was increased from $525 million after
investors bid for at least 3.4 times the shares on offer, the
people said, declining to be named before an official
announcement.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. , the largest maker of sport-
utility vehicles and tractors, climbed 2.1 percent to 731 rupees,
its highest since at least 1991, after its two-wheeler sales in
September jumped more than five times to 16,569 vehicles.  Foreign fund inflows to India’s equities have increased 51
percent this year, making the benchmark index the most expensive
in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include Brazil,
Russia and China. Foreigners have invested 240.8 billion rupees
in equities this month.  Overseas  funds  bought a net  47.6 billion rupees  ($1.06
billion) of Indian equities on Sept. 29 and Sept. 30, extending
this year’s record inflows to 891.2 billion rupees, according to
the nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
