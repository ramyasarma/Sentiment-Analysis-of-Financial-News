Russia’s wheat production may plunge
by 33 percent this year after the most-severe drought in 50
years harmed crops, a U.S. Department of Agriculture unit said.  Output will fall to 41.5 million metric tons in the year
that began July 1 from 61.7 million tons last year, the USDA’s
Foreign Agricultural Service said in a report posted today on
its website. The attache’s estimate was below the official U.S.
projection announced last month. Russian exports will plunge 78
percent to 4.1 million tons, the service said.  “Significant grain area was destroyed by drought, and
harvested area might be one of the lowest in the last 10
years,” the U.S. service said. Russia, once the world’s third-
largest grower, barred exports of grains in August.  On Sept. 10, the  USDA  projected that Russia would produce
42.5 million tons of wheat and export 3.5 million tons.  Russian barley output may drop 54 percent to 8.2 million
tons from a year earlier, and exports may plummet 91 percent to
250,000 tons, the U.S. attache said. Corn production may drop 11
percent to 3.5 million tons.  Today, wheat prices fell in Chicago, capping the longest
slump in four months, as rains in Russia and Eastern Europe
improved the prospects for winter crops.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 7.75 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $6.4725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The grain dropped for the sixth straight session, the
longest slide since early June. The price has climbed 20 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
