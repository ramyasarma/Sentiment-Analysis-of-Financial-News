Tonengeneral Sekiyu K.K. , a unit of
Exxon Mobil Corp., fell to its lowest level in more than seven
years in Tokyo trading after Exxon said it may sell part of its
Japanese gasoline retailing operations.  The shares declined 6.3 percent to 711 yen, the lowest
since March 2003. The benchmark Topix index was down 0.9
percent.  Exxon Mobil  is considering selling some of its retailing
operations on the southwestern island of Kyushu, the company
said on Oct. 2 on its website. It issued the statement after
reports of it was considering selling some Japanese assets.  Nikkei English News on Oct. 2 reported Exxon Mobil, which
has 400 gasoline stations in Kyushu, may also sell other retail
operations in western Japan, where it has a total of about 1,600
stations.  Exxon Mobil is also considering closing some refineries to
reduce capacity by about 20 percent, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
