State Bank of Mauritius Ltd., the
country’s second-biggest company by market value, invested $30
million in its business in India, Pauline Seeyave, the divional
leader of finance for the lender, said.  “We can more than double the contribution over the next
three years” that the Port Louis-based company’s Indian unit
makes in profit for State Bank of Mauritius, she said at a
conference in Johannesburg today. The company is boosting its
investment in India to grow its services to mid-sized businesses
in the country, she said.  State Bank of Mauritius has a market share of about 20
percent in its home market and will increase its retail services
in the country by focusing on the issue of debit and credit
cards, while also concentrating on services to rich individuals,
Seeyave said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
