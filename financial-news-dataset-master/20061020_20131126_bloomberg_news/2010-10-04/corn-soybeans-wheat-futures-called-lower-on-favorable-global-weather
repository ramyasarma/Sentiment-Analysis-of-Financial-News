What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as dry weather aids U.S.
harvesting and speculators reduce record bets on higher prices,
said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst at Prime Agricultural
Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel lower
after rain during the past week boosted soil moisture and
improved planting conditions for crops in Brazil and Argentina,
Henderson said. Soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $3 lower per
2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open down 0.3 cent
to 0.4 cent a pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as rains boost crop prospects in Russia, Ukraine
and Kazakhstan, and dry weather aids harvesting in Canada,
Henderson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
