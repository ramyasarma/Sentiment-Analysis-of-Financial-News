Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
ordered a review of the country’s grain export ban at the end of
this year’s harvest, the Kremlin press service said today in an
e-mailed statement.  The government said when it barred grain exports from Aug.
15 to Dec. 31 that a review would be carried out once the
harvest was gathered. First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov
said Oct. 1 that it doesn’t make sense to lift the ban until
July 1, 2011, RIA Novosti reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
