Brazil’s real rose to near the
strongest level in two years after the failure of yesterday’s
presidential election to produce a winner raised speculation the
government may postpone measures to curb the currency’s gain.  The real advanced 0.3 percent to 1.6839 per dollar at 8:50
a.m. New York time, from 1.6897 on Oct. 1, when the currency
reached 1.6735, the strongest level since Sept. 3, 2008.  Former cabinet chief  Dilma Rousseff  finished first in
Brazil’s presidential election yesterday and will face her main
rival,  Jose Serra , in a runoff later this month after failing to
capture a majority of votes.  The real may gain this month as the runoff discourages
policy makers from following through on a threat to take
measures to stem a rally that has pushed the currency to near a
two-year high, said  Tony Volpon , a Latin America strategist at
Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York in an interview
on Bloomberg Television.  “I think that investors view this weekend’s election
results as positive,” said  Nick Chamie , head of emerging-
markets research at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. “It will
force both candidates to articulate their economic agendas and
policy views.”  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 11.41 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
