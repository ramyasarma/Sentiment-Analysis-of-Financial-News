Uruguay’s  consumer prices  rose at the
slowest pace in three months in September, led by declines in
furniture and entertainment costs, the country’s national
statistics institute reported.  Prices rose 0.3 percent from a month earlier and 6.32
percent from a year ago, the agency said in a report today.
Entertainment costs fell 0.16 percent and furniture prices were
down 0.02 percent, the report said.  The annual inflation rate reported today is within the
bank’s target range of 3 percent to 7 percent and may decline
further following the central bank’s decision to lift its
benchmark rate a quarter-point on Sept. 23, said Rafael Mantero,
an economist at research company CPA-Ferrere in Montevideo.  The central bank raised its  overnight lending rate  to 6.5
percent from 6.25 percent, citing inflationary pressures created
by overseas demand for goods coupled with the effect of strong
domestic demand that was outstripping local supply.  Uruguay’s peso rose 0.9 percent to 20.075 per dollar at
3:25 p.m. New York time. The currency has fallen 2.9 percent so
far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
