Roland Koch, the outgoing deputy
leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party who served for 11
years as prime minister of Hesse state, said he doesn’t intend
to return to front-line politics.  “I gave a lot of thought to leaving politics,” Koch told
reporters in Berlin today when asked whether he is interested in
taking over from Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is
currently in the hospital. “I’m not revising that decision.”  Koch unexpectedly announced his resignation from frontline
politics in May, saying he planned to turn to a career in
business. He stood down as Hesse state premier on Aug. 31.  Koch was in Berlin at the presentation of his book being
published this week, also attended by the chancellor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
