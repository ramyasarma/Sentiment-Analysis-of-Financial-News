Hog futures fell to the lowest level
since February on signs that U.S. pork supplies are outpacing
demand. Cattle prices dropped.  On Oct. 1,  wholesale pork , or the cutout, reached the
lowest level in nine weeks, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Last week, the price of  hogs  for immediate delivery to
meatpackers fell 5.9 percent, the most since January. On Sept.
30, the average U.S. hog carcass  weighed  1.4 percent more than a
year earlier.  “We had cash and cutouts both lower on Friday,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment
Co. in Minneapolis. There is a tendency for the market to
decline at this time of year because of heavier hogs, he said.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.975 cent, or 1.3
percent, to settle at 71.9 cents a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price touched 71.75
cents, the lowest level for a most-active contract since Feb.
25. The commodity has climbed 9.6 percent in 2010.  On Oct. 1, wholesale pork dropped 2.1 percent to 86.96
cents a pound, the lowest level since July 27, and hogs for
immediate delivery fell 1.8 percent to 75.87 cents a pound. The
average hog carcass in the U.S. weighed 205.5 pounds (93.2
kilograms) on Sept. 30, up from 202.6 pounds a year earlier,
USDA data show.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 1.05 cents, or
1.1 percent, to settle at 97.3 cents a pound. Earlier, the price
touched 97.1, the lowest level since Sept. 9. The commodity has
gained 13 percent this year.  At midday, wholesale  choice beef  declined 0.4 percent to
$1.5352 a pound, the lowest level since Aug. 11.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement dropped 1.6
cents, or 1.4 percent, to settle at $1.10675 a pound. The price
has advanced 15 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
