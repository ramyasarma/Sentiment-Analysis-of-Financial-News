Vale SA , the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, will receive a credit line of as much as $1 billion
from Export Development Canada to finance export projects from
the North American country.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro, will use up to $250 million
from Canada’s export-financing unit credit line to fund
investments on its Long Harbor nickel refinery plant in the
province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the company said in a
statement today.  An additional $250 million of credit will be available for
Ontario province projects, the company said. The remaining $500
million will be used to finance purchases of Canadian goods and
services for operations outside the country, it said.  Vale said Sept. 10 it will borrow $1.23 billion from the
Export-Import Bank of China and the Bank of China Ltd. to buy
ships from a Chinese shipyard.  The Canadian loan was negotiated at market interest rates,
Vale said. “This agreement is part of a broader financing
package for our investment program involving official credit
institutions from several countries,” it said.  Vale acquired Canadian nickel miner Inco Ltd. in January
2007 after paying C$19.4 billion ($19 billion) in the biggest
foreign acquisition by a Brazilian company.  Ottawa-based  EDC  is a state-owned agency that funds
exporters.  Vale’s preferred shares fell 0.6 percent to 46.49 at 11:25
a.m. in Sao Paulo trading. The stock has added 27 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
