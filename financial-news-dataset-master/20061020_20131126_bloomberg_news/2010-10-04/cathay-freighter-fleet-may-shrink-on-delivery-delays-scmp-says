Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd .’s
freighter fleet may shrink next year because the start of
deliveries of  Boeing Co . 747-8F aircraft on order has been
delayed to August from January, the South China Morning Post
said, citing unidentified officials at the company.  The airline will have to transfer four 747-400BCF
freighters to its air cargo venture with  Air China Ltd . during
the first half of next year, cutting fleet size, the Hong Kong-
based English-language newspaper reported today, citing a
spokesman and executive at Cathay, neither identified.  The airline is looking for short-term plane leases to
bridge the gap, the Post said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
