Frontier Rare Earths Ltd. plans an
initial public offering in Canada to develop a South African
deposit of rare metals used in car batteries and computers.  Frontier, based in Luxembourg, will sell units consisting
of one share and half a warrant in the IPO, the company said
today in a statement. The company plans to list its shares on
the Toronto Stock Exchange.  Frontier aims to become one of the leading producers of
rare-earth metals outside of China and one of the first new
producers of the elements after  Lynas Corp.  and  Molycorp Inc. ,
according to its regulatory filing. Frontier is developing the
Zandkopsdrift deposit in South Africa’s Northern Cape Province,
the company said in a Sept. 30 filing.  Rare earths are a group of chemically similar metallic
elements, including lanthanum, neodymium and cerium. The
elements are used in radar, high-powered magnets, mini hard-
drives in computers, catalytic converters for vehicles and
electric-car batteries.  CIBC World Markets is leading a group of banks including
Canaccord Genuity, Cormark Securities Inc., Byron Securities
Ltd. and National Bank Financial for the sale. Frontier didn’t
indicate how much it plans to raise.  Chief Executive Officer James Kenny in Luxembourg wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
