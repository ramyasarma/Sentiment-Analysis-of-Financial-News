Copper climbed for a second day,
trading near a 26-month high, on speculation supply may lag
behind demand as the consumption outlook improves in China, the
world’s largest user. Nickel advanced to a five-month high.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 0.8 percent to $8,162 a metric ton,
and traded at $8,150 at 12:09 p.m. Singapore time. The contract
rose as high as $8,178 a ton on Oct. 1, the highest level since
July 22, 2008. Futures for December-delivery on the Comex in New
York added as much as 0.6 percent to $3.7140 a pound. The
Shanghai Futures Exchange is closed till Oct. 7 for the National
Day holiday.  China will address “structural problems” and stabilize
its economy by increasing domestic demand, Premier  Wen Jiabao 
said in an interview with CNN yesterday. Wen also said he’d
argued before the global recession that China’s economic
development “lacks balance, coordination and sustainability.”  “China is still either not contributing very much or is a
drag on global apparent demand growth for metals at the moment,
but this is unlikely to last given the current levels of demand
in end-use sectors, for which growth is set to remain robust,”
Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts including  Jim Lennon  wrote in a
Oct. 4 report. “This should mean that China is again likely to
increase apparent demand whilst the rest of the world is
slowing.”  Refined copper output will lag behind demand by 435,000
metric tons next year, the first shortage since 2007, according
to the International Copper Study Group. The surplus is
estimated at 200,000 tons this year and 166,000 tons for 2009,
it said on Oct. 1.  Inventories  monitored by the London Metal Exchange, down 26
percent this year, are at the lowest level since Nov. 3. Copper
 stockpiles  tallied by the Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped to
the lowest level in more than a year last week.  Aluminum and zinc in London were little changed at $2,356 a
ton and $2,230 a ton respectively. Nickel climbed as much as 0.9
percent to $24,050 a ton, the highest price since May, lead
gained 0.4 percent to $2,304 a ton and tin hadn’t traded as of
12:20 p.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
