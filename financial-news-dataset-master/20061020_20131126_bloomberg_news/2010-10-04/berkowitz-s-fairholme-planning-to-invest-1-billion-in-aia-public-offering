Fairholme Capital Management, the
biggest private investor in  American International Group Inc. ,
said it has provided a “firm indication of interest” in
investing about $1 billion in the public offering of AIG’s main
Asia unit.  AIA Group Ltd. is a “household name” poised for expansion
in some of the world’s fastest growing economies, Fairholme
founder Bruce Berkowitz said today in a statement distributed by
PR Newswire.  AIG Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  is seeking to
wind down the insurer’s $182.3 billion U.S. bailout by selling
shares in AIA, divesting non-U.S. units and converting the
Treasury Department’s stake into common stock. Hong Kong-based
AIA may seek as much as HK$115.3 billion ($14.9 billion) in an
IPO, according to two people familiar with the plan.  Fairholme said last week that it invested more than $1.8
billion in AIG stock and debt, and owns about 24 percent of
AIG’s privately held common shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
