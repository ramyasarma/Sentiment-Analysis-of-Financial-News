FIFA, soccer’s ruling body, suspended
the Nigeria Football Federation with immediate effect because of
interference in its affairs by the government.  During the suspension, the NFF won’t be able to be
represented in any regional, continental or international
competitions, including at club level, nor in exhibition
matches. That would rule the national team out of qualifying
games for the Africa Cup of Nations.  The decision follows recent events linked to the
federation, such as court actions against elected members of its
executive committee preventing them from exercising their
duties, FIFA said today in a statement.  It also concerns a ministerial decision to have the league
start without relegation taking effect from the previous season.
The federation’s executive committee “cannot work properly due
to this interference,” FIFA said.  “The suspension will be maintained until the court actions
have ceased and the duly elected NFF executive committee is able
to work without any interference,” FIFA added.  Nigeria’s national team is ranked 34th in the world by
FIFA. It finished bottom of its group at this year’s World Cup
in South Africa with one point from three games.  Nigeria’s government reacted to the World Cup
disappointment by banning the team from international
competition for two years. It then lifted the ban under pressure
from FIFA.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
