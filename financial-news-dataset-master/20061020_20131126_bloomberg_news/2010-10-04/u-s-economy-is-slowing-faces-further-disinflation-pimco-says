The U.S. economy is slowing and the
inflation rate is likely to decline further because of a “huge
output gap,” said Paul McCulley, a managing director at Pacific
Investment Management Co., on the firm’s website.  Pimco’s cyclical outlook estimates that U.S. real gross
domestic product growth will decline to a range of 1.5 percent
to 2 percent over the 12 months ending Sept. 30, 2011, from 2.6
percent in the third quarter of 2010. The GDP price index will
fall to a range of 0.75 percent to 1.25 percent from 1.3
percent, Pimco estimates.   The company also expects the economies of Europe, Japan and
the U.K. will slow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
