Nawras, the Omani phone company
selling shares in an initial public offering, has a fair value
of as much as 911 ($2.36) baisas a share,  National Bank of Oman
SAOG  estimates. That is above Nawras’ price range.  The company, controlled by  Qatar Telecom QSC , set a range
of 702 baisas to 902 baisas a share in its book-built IPO that
opened Sept. 15 and will run for a month. National Bank of Oman
sees a fair value of at least 781 baisas a share.  The share is “a good buy for the long-term, given the
perceived growth of the business and the high dividend payout
expectation,” National Bank of Oman said in a research report
dated Sept. 27 and obtained by Bloomberg News today.  Omani Qatari Telecommunications Co., the formal name of
Nawras, competes with  Oman Telecommunications Co. , the largest
phone operator in the Persian Gulf country. Muscat-based Nawras
started operations in 2005 and has a 45 percent share of the
sultanate’s mobile-phone market. The company is offering 40
percent of its equity or 260 million shares in the IPO.  One Omani rial comprises 1,000 baisas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
