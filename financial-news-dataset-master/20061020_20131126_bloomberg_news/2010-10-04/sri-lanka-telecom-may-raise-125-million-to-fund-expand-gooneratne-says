Sri Lanka Telecom Plc , the nation’s
biggest fixed-line phone company, may raise as much as $125
million to fund expansion, a company executive said.  “We have received responses to a request for proposals
from banks that include selling bonds overseas and syndicated
loans,” Chief Financial Officer Shiron Gooneratne said in a
telephone interview from Colombo today.  Gooneratne said the company was spending on expanding its
network, including in the island’s north and east as the end of
the nation’s civil war after almost three decades spurs an
economic  recovery . The defeat of the Tamil rebels last year has
prompted carriers, including the local unit of Bharti Airtel Ltd.
and Emirates Telecommunications Corp. to start services in the
previously strife-torn regions.  Sri Lanka Telecom, which also operates a mobile-phone unit,
is  owned  by the South Asian island’s government and Malaysian
billionaire  T. Ananda Krishnan ’s Usaha Tegas Sdn. Profit at the
carrier more than doubled to 769 million rupees ($7 million) in
the three months ended June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
