Nigeria appointed Barclays Capital
and Lagos-based FBN Capital Ltd. as advisers for its planned
$500 million Eurobond sale, an official at the Finance Ministry
said.  “Both companies will work together on the bond issue,”
Okwudili Ojukwu-Enendu, spokesman for Finance Minister  Olusegun Aganga , said by phone from Abuja today.  The sale of Nigeria’s first Eurobond will act as a
benchmark so that local companies can price their bonds
accordingly, Aganga said in London on Sept. 3. Africa’s second-
biggest economy and top crude producer plans to use funds from
the sale to develop infrastructure and reduce dependence on oil
exports. Oil accounts for more than 80 percent of government
revenue, according to the Finance Ministry.  Foreign investor interest in the Eurobond has been strong,
with some investors asking Nigeria to increase the size to $1
billion, Aganga said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
