Suzlon Energy Ltd. , India’s biggest
wind-turbine maker, gained in Mumbai trading for the second
trading day after rising interest from overseas and Indian
investors in local shares, an analyst said.  Suzlon advanced 7.1 percent to 58.25 rupees at 2:42 p.m.
local time after climbing as much as 7.4 percent. The stock has
declined 36 percent this year compared with a 17 percent
increase in the benchmark  Sensitive Index .  “The Indian market has been buoyant as more investors turn
to Indian stocks and Suzlon is benefiting from this,” said
 Krishnakant Thakur , a Mumbai-based analyst with Quant Broking
Pvt. “Suzlon’s valuations are cheaper than its international
rivals at the moment and the market expects a better order
inflow in the second half of this fiscal.”  Foreign fund inflows to India’s equities have increased 51
percent this year, making the benchmark index the most expensive
in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include Brazil,
Russia and China. Overseas investors have extended this year’s
record inflows to 891.2 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
