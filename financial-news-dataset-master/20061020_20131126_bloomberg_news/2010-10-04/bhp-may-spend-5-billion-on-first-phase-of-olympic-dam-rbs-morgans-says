BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
largest mineral producer, may spend $5 billion on the first
phase of the expansion of its Olympic Dam mine in Australia, RBS
Morgans Ltd. cited the company as saying.  “BHP estimates capital expenditure for the first module to
be in the order of $5 billion as opposed to tens of billions of
dollars for the original project,” analysts led by  Lyndon Fagan 
said in a report after visiting BHP’s copper assets in South
America. Construction may start in a few years, Fagan said,
without specifying a time frame.  The expansion will convert the underground mine into an
open pit and may cost $16 billion in total, Citigroup Inc. said
in February.  BHP  may make a financial investment decision on the
expansion in 18 months, Chief Executive Officer  Marius Kloppers 
said on Aug. 25.  Expanding the mine would take 11 years and increase copper
output almost fourfold to 750,000 metric tons a year, boost gold
production eightfold and uranium by almost fivefold, according
to Melbourne-based BHP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
