Mosaic Co. , North America’s second-
largest fertilizer producer, reported fiscal first-quarter
profit that trailed analysts’ estimates as potash prices
declined.  Earnings per share in the three months through August were
67 cents, trailing the 71-cent  average estimate  of 18 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income rose to $297.7 million from
$100.6 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier, Plymouth,
Minnesota-based Mosaic said today in a statement. Sales
increased 50 percent to $2.19 billion.  Potash for immediate delivery in Iowa, the top U.S. corn-
growing state, has fallen 9.5 percent this year as fertilizer
makers cut prices to spur sales. Farmers deferred purchases of
the crop nutrient in 2008 and 2009 in response to record high
prices and the global economic slowdown.  “Producers were forced to give back price increases in
July in order to spur summer refill demand when the market was
less robust,”  Edlain Rodriguez , a New York-based analyst at
Gleacher & Co., wrote in a Sept. 24 note to clients. He rates
the shares a “buy.”  Mosaic, 64 percent owned by closely held Cargill Inc., fell
$1.14, or 1.9 percent, to $57.65 at 4:32 p.m. after the close of
New York Stock Exchange trading.  The shares  declined 1.6 percent
this year through today’s close.  (Mosaic scheduled a conference call for tomorrow at 10 a.m.
New York time at +1-888-680-0893. The passcode is 18586123.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
