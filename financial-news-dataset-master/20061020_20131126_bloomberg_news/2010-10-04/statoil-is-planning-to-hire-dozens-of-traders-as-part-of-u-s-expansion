Statoil ASA , Norway’s biggest oil and
gas producer, plans to hire “dozens” of workers, including
traders, as it expands its U.S. trading operations after
agreeing to supply two East Coast refineries with oil.  “We will grow as part of this and other growth initiatives
in the U.S.,”  Ola Morten Aanestad , a company spokesman, said in
a telephone interview. “There will be significant growth going
forward as our business in North America has been increased with
more equity.”  The spokesman declined to say exactly how many traders
Statoil will hire. There are 130 employees at the company’s
Stamford, Connecticut, office, he said, including oil and gas
traders and support staff.  Statoil will supply refineries in Paulsboro, New Jersey,
and Delaware City, Delaware, with crude oil and feedstock,
according to a statement today from PBF Holding Co. Morgan
Stanley will buy the fuels from the two plants. The two
refineries have a combined capacity of 367,200 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Statoil plans to use its South Riding Point crude storage
and transhipment terminal on Grand Bahama Island in the Bahamas
to help supply the two refineries, according to Aanestad.  Statoil expects to raise the potential crude it can recover
from maturing fields off Norway’s shore by about 252 million
barrels this year. The company expects drilling and well-design
initiatives and other measures to raise total recovery as much
as 4.2 billion barrels, Gro Aksnes, vice president of reservoir
technology, said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
