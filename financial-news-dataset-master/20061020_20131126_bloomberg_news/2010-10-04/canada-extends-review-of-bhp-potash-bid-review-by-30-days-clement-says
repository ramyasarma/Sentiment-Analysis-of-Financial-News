Canada extended the deadline to
review  BHP Billiton Ltd. ’s $40 billion hostile takeover offer
for  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  by an additional 30 days,
Industry Minister  Tony Clement  said in a statement.  “I have extended the timeline for making my determination
of BHP Billiton’s proposed acquisition of Potash Corp,” Clement
said in the statement. “I will take the time necessary to do a
thorough review of this investment proposal.”  Clement’s industry department is reviewing BHP’s $130-a-
share bid for Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Potash Corp. to
determine if the takeover proposal by Melbourne-based BHP will
have “net benefits” for Canada. The government had until today
to review the bid under the initial 45-day deadline. The move to
extend the review is “not unusual” according to Industry
Canada’s  website.   Further extensions would have to be agreed upon by BHP
under the  Investment Canada Act .  Potash Corp., the world’s largest producer of its namesake
crop nutrient, has rejected BHP’s offer as too low and said it
was expecting competing bids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
