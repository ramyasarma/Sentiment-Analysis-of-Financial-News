The New York Jets released David
Clowney to make room on the roster for wide receiver Santonio
Holmes, the Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey, reported.  Holmes, 26, was traded to the Jets from the Pittsburgh
Steelers in April, the same day he was banned for the first four
games of the season for violating the National Football League’s
substance-abuse policy.  Holmes, the Most Valuable Player of the 2009 Super Bowl,
caught 79 passes for a team-leading 1,248 yards and five
touchdowns in Pittsburgh last season. Clowney had one reception
for 22 yards this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
