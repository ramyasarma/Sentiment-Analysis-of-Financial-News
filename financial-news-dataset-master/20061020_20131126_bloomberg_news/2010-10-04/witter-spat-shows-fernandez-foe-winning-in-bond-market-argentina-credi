The record difference in yields
between two Argentine bonds due in 2017 is prompting Gramercy
and  Aberdeen Asset Management  to bet that the local securities
will outperform their overseas peers.  The yield on Argentine dollar bonds sold under local law
rose to 11.42 percent on Sept. 23, or 188 basis points more than
similar-maturity securities issued overseas, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The gap shrank to 132 by Oct. 1 and may
fall to 50, said  Ajay Jani , who helps manage about $2.5 billion
with Gramercy, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based investment fund.  The domestic notes “are a compelling value,” Jani, who
bought the local debt last week, said in a telephone interview.  Argentine bonds offer the highest yields in developing
markets, after Ecuador and Venezuela, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. indexes. Argentine debt last month beat all
emerging-market bonds as rising exports pushed central bank
reserves to a record $51.2 billion and a credit-rating increase
boosted confidence in the economy.  The yield on the 7 percent domestic notes, called Bonar Xs,
was fell 16 basis points to 10.48 percent at 5:23 p.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg pricing. The yield on the 8.75
percent global bonds was little changed at 9.36 percent.  Edwin Gutierrez , who manages about $5 billion worth of
emerging-market debt at Aberdeen in London, said he also bought
Bonar X bonds due in 2017 because they were “cheap.”  The Bonar’s yield may fall to about 7.5 percent by the end
of 2011, said Jani of Gramercy, which specialized in emerging-
market debt.  Debt Restructuring  The global Argentine bond was issued in June as part of
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ’s $12.2 billion
defaulted debt swap. The Bonar Xs and other local bonds are sold
under Argentine law. The global dollar bonds are governed by New
York law.  Argentina’s central bank estimates growth in South
America’s second-largest economy after Brazil will accelerate to
9.5 percent this year, the fastest pace since 1992, as farmers
sell a record 55-million metric ton soybean crop and car sales
surge to the  highest level  ever. Argentine industrial production
rose 10.1 percent in August from a year earlier, more than the 8
percent median estimate in a survey by Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to own Argentine dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries slid four basis points today to
658, according to JPMorgan. Argentina’s so-called spread is the
highest after Venezuela, at 1142 and Ecuador, 1013.  ‘Risk Premium’  “The current risk premium on Argentine debt is well in
excess of what we think is reasonable given what is going on in
the country economically,” said Jani.  The peso was little changed at 3.9614 per dollar. The
currency touched 3.9755 per dollar on Sept. 28, its weakest
level since its inception in 1992. Warrants linked to economic
growth were unchanged at 11.97 cents, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The cost of protecting Argentine bonds against default for
five years using credit-default swaps rose 18 basis points today
to 755. The swaps dropped 200 points during September, the
biggest decline among government debt worldwide. Credit-default
swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying
securities or the cash equivalent should a government or company
fail to adhere to debt agreements.  Buenos Aires province sold $550 million of 11.75 percent
notes to yield 12 percent on Sept. 27, according to Bloomberg
data. Bank of America Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG managed the
sale of the dollar bonds, which mature in October 2015.  Delayed Sale  Empresa Distribuidora y Comercializadora Norte SA, 
Argentina’s biggest power distributor, last week opened an offer
to exchange 10.5 percent bonds due in 2017 for 9.75 percent
notes that mature in 2022 plus cash. The swap closes Nov. 1.  Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  in May delayed a $1 billion
sale of global 2017 bonds as part of Argentina’s debt
restructuring, saying the country would wait for yields to fall
below 10 percent.  Fernandez said Sept. 24 that she isn’t interested in
selling bonds at an 8 percent yield while the government can
still use international  reserves  to pay debt. The government has
tapped $5 billion worth of reserves this year and plans to use
another $7.5 billion in 2011, Boudou told lawmakers Sept. 16.  The surge in Bonar X yields relative to their 2017 global
peers may be related to sales of the Bonar securities by the
Argentine government pension agency, Anses, said Gutierrez from
Aberdeen. Anses Executive Director Diego Bossio didn’t return a
phone call and e-mails seeking comment.  Aberdeen recently bought local law 2017 bonds on the
expectation that the yield gap against the global bonds will
tighten, he said. The gap between the securities could widen
again in the future if supply picks up, Gutierrez said.  “They’ll have more to sell at some point,” Gutierrez
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
