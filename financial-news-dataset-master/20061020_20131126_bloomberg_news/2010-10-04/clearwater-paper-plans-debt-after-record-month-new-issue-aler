Clearwater Paper Corp ., the maker of
consumer tissue, bleached paperboard and wood products, is
marketing debt after the second-busiest month for dollar-
denominated corporate bond sales on record.  Clearwater Paper, based in Spokane, Washington, plans to
sell $350 million of senior unsecured notes, according to a
Sept. 29 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  U.S. corporate bond sales jumped to $160.6 billion in
September, a 56 percent jump from August issuance, and trailing
only May 2008’s volume of $161.7 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg that goes back to 1999. Offerings jumped
as investment-grade borrowing costs fell to a record low,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Sales may
slow as companies begin reporting third-quarter earnings, said
 Tom Murphy , a money manager at Columbia Management.  “One of the key drivers of what issuance for the rest of
the year is going to look like is how companies are framing up
third-quarter earnings,” Murphy, who helps oversee more than
$25 billion of investment-grade credit in Minneapolis. “If it’s
kind of like the second quarter, which was decent surprises to
the upside, a relatively sanguine view for the rest of the year,
that would surprise the markets.”  The so-called earnings season typically begins with a
report from  Alcoa Inc.  The largest U.S. aluminum producer is
scheduled to report its third-quarter results on Oct. 7.  Investment-Grade Spreads  Investment-grade corporate bond spreads were unchanged for
the eighth straight day at 184 basis points on Oct. 1, according
to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master
Index. Absolute yields on the debt were unchanged at 3.69
percent, a drop of 6 basis points for the week. The measure fell
to 3.645 percent on Sept. 28, the lowest in data going back to
Oct. 31, 1986.  Companies sold $2.84 billion of debt on Oct. 1, Bloomberg
data show, including $2.21 billion of high-yield securities, the
data show. High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below Baa3 by
Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.
       Burger King Holdings Inc. , the fast-food chain franchiser
with more than 7,200 U.S. locations, was the biggest issuer,
selling $800 million of notes after pulling a euro-denominated
portion of the offering, Bloomberg data show. Susan Robison, a
spokeswoman for Miami-based Burger King, didn’t return a call
seeking comment.  Clearwater Paper plans to use proceeds from its offering
along with $210 million of cash on hand to finance its purchase
of Cellu Tissue Holdings Inc., according to its filing.  Yields on junk-rated corporate bonds fell 4 basis points to
8.05 percent, down 8 basis points for the week, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index.
