---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES  New York: U.S. stocks fell for the third time in four days as
analysts’ rating downgrades of companies including Microsoft
Corp. and Macy’s Inc. triggered caution before the start of the
third-quarter earnings season.
*The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 1 percent to 1,134.7 at
2:06 p.m. in New York after rising 0.2 percent earlier.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 95.29 points, or 0.9
percent, to 10,734.39.
*Microsoft slumped 2.3 percent after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. removed its “buy” rating on the shares.  London: European stocks declined for a sixth day, the longest
stretch of losses since January 2009, as reports on U.S. home
sales and factory orders failed to ease concern about the
strength of the world’s largest economy.
*The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.5 percent to 257.74 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the lowest level since August.
*The gauge fell the most in three months last week amid concern
the economy is slowing as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis curbs
growth.  Tokyo: Japanese stocks fell, as concern banks will need more
capital to meet stricter rules dragged an index of lenders to
the lowest level since at least 1983.
*The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.3 percent to 9,381.06 at
the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo after swinging between a gain of
1.1 percent and a drop of 0.5 percent.
*The Topix index lost 0.9 percent to 822.74, the lowest close
since Sept. 8.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 1
percent to 4,625.30 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney.
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.5 percent to 3,228.92 at the
5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar advanced against most of its major
counterparts as investors avoided higher-yielding assets after
reports on U.S. factory orders and home sales failed to relieve
concern that the recovery is stalling.
*The dollar appreciated 0.8 percent to $1.3685 per euro at
3:02 p.m. in New York, from $1.3791 on Oct. 1.
*The yen slid 0.2 percent to 83.38 per dollar, from 83.22.
*The euro depreciated 0.5 percent to 114.18 yen, from 114.78 yen.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasuries rose, pushing two-year yields to a record
low, as government data showing U.S. factory orders declined
more than forecast fueled speculation the Federal Reserve will
increase asset purchases.
*The two-year yield fell 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to a record 0.3987 percent, according to Bloomberg
generic data.
*The three-year yield touched 0.5892 percent.  COMMODITIES  New York: Gold futures fell as investor demand eased following
the precious metal’s rally to a record. Silver dropped from a
30-year high.
*Gold futures for December delivery fell $1 to settle at
$1,316.80 at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
*The price has climbed 20 percent this year.  METALS  New York: Copper prices fell the most in three weeks as the
dollar rebounded, reducing the appeal of commodities as
alternative investments.
*Copper futures for December delivery slid 2.65 cents, or
0.7 percent, to close at $3.664 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the
Comex.
*Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange rose for
the first time in six sessions.  OIL  New York: Crude oil was little changed after reaching an eight-
week high as equities slipped and orders for U.S. capital goods
increased.
*Crude oil for November delivery declined 7 cents to $81.51
a barrel at the 2:30 p.m. close of floor trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  WHAT TO WATCH: Australia’s central bank will decide
whether higher interest rates are needed to avert faster
inflation amid signs that past increases are cooling the
nation’s property market.  The Reserve Bank of Australia will raise the overnight cash
rate target to 4.75 percent from 4.5 percent, 19 of 25
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said. Futures traders
estimated a 60 percent chance of a move, contracts showed at 5
p.m. in Sydney.
*The RBA’s decision is scheduled for 2:30 p.m.
*Australia retail sales for August, 11:30 a.m. in Sydney.
*Australia job ads for September, 11:30 a.m. in Sydney.  BLOOMBERG TV: Selected guests (Sydney time)
