Overseas  funds  bought a net  19.6
billion rupees  ($439.6 million) of Indian equities on Oct. 1,
extending this year’s record inflows to 910.8 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market regulator.  Investors purchased 45.6 billion rupees of shares and sold
26 billion rupees, the Securities and Exchange Board of India
said  today . They bought 2.82 billion rupees of bonds, taking
total debt purchases this year to 454.3 billion rupees.  The flows have pushed the benchmark  Sensitive index  to the
highest level in more than 2 1/2 years and helped the rupee
rebound 7 percent from an eight-month low in May. Equity
purchases this year include 226 billion rupees from the primary
market, the regulator said.  Overseas  investors  have invested 4.05 trillion rupees in
stocks and 776.9 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed
into the country in 1993. The previous record was in 2009 when
flows reached 834.2 billion rupees, sparking the biggest rally
in 18 years. They withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from
stocks in 2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
