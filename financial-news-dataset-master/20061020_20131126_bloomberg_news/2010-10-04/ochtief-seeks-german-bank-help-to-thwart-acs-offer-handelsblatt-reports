Hochtief AG  plans to enlist the help
of German banks, including UniCredit’s Hypovereinsbank,
Commerzbank AG, DZ Bank, and BHF Bank, to help it fend off
Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA’s hostile bid,
 Handelsblatt  reported without citing the source of the
information.  Hochtief aims to create a conflict of interest for the
banks, thereby complicating the implementation of ACS’s bid, the
newspaper reported. Hochtief is also in “loose talks” with
investors from countries such as Kuwait and Abu Dhabi,
Handelsblatt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
