Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said the
exchange rates of the world’s major currencies should remain
“relatively stable.”  “We should intensify macroeconomic policy coordination,
manage with caution the timing and pace of an exit strategy from
economic stimulus and keep the exchange rates of major reserve
currencies relatively stable,” Wen said in the opening session
of a meeting of European and Asian leaders in Brussels today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
