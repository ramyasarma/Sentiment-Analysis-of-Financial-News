Mexico’s peso dropped the most in
almost a month after a manufacturing index fell more than
forecast, signaling a slowdown in the economic recovery.  The peso dropped 0.5 percent to 12.5921 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.5253 on Oct. 1. The decline was the
biggest since Sept. 7 and pared the currency’s gain against the
dollar this year to 4 percent.  “We still don’t have any data indicating that there will
be strong growth,” said  Omar Martin del Campo , a trader at
Banco Ve Por Mas SA in Mexico City. “The economic data isn’t
giving much breathing room.”  Mexico’s manufacturing index fell to 52.2 in September,
below the median estimate of 53 in a Bloomberg survey of six
analysts. The nation’s economy grew 7.6 percent in the second
quarter after contracting 6.5 percent last year, the worst
recession since the 1930s, the finance ministry said.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.457 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.48 centavo to 132.83 centavos on the peso.  Consumer confidence rose to 91.6 in September, the national
statistics agency said, above the estimate of 88.7. Total
manufacturing orders in the U.S. dropped 0.5 percent in August,
more than the median estimate of 0.4 percent drop in a Bloomberg
survey. The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  Traders didn’t exercise any of the $600 million in dollar
options available today, the central bank said on its website.
None of the options available this month have been triggered.  The bank has been selling $600 million in dollar options
monthly, allowing it to buy dollars as it seeks to boost foreign
reserves after the peso reached a record low last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
