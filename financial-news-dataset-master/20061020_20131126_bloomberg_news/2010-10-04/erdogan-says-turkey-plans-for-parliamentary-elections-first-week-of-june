Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip
Erdogan said he expects to hold nationwide parliamentary
elections in the first week of June.  Campaigning for the vote is likely to begin in March,
Erdogan said in televized comments from Ankara today.  The timetable means there won’t be time to start
parliamentary work on a new constitution before the polling, he
said. The assembly will be busy approving the 2011 budget and
passing legislation associated with the constitutional
ammendments approved last month, Erdogan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
