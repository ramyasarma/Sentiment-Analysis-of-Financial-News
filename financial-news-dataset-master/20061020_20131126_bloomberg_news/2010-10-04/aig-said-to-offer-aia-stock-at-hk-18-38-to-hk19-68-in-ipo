American International Group Inc. ,
the bailed-out insurer, may offer shares of its main Asia unit
at a price of HK$18.38 ($2.37) to HK$19.68, according to two
people with knowledge of the plan.  The number of shares to be offered is among the details yet
to be finalized, according to one of the people, who declined to
be identified because the talks are private. The stock is
scheduled to start trading on Oct. 29.  AIG, once the world’s largest insurer, is selling assets to
help repay its $182.3 billion government bailout. The insurer
said last week that the U.S. Treasury will convert its $49.1
billion preferred stake in the company into common shares for
sale on the open market, beginning next year.  Hong Kong’s benchmark  stock index  has advanced about 16
percent since June 1, driving an increase in share sales.
Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Morgan Stanley are among banks leading the AIA sale.  AIA operates in 15 Asian markets with 23,500 employees,
320,000 agents and more than 23 million of in-force policies,
according to a Sept. 20 statement. Its in-force policies are
worth $13.9 billion, according to a Sept. 24 report by Goldman
Sachs.  Mark Herr , a spokesman for New York-based AIG, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
