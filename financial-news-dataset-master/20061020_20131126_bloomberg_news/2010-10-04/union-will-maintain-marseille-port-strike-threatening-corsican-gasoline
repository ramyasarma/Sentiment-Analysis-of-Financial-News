A strike blocking the port of
Marseille will continue even if that means cutting off gasoline
supplies to the island of Corsica, France’s CGT union said.  “We’ve been expressing our position to management for
months,” the CGT union’s Pascal Galeote said today on France
Info radio. A gasoline shortage isn’t the union’s aim, “but the
situation is such today that we may not be able to avoid that.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
