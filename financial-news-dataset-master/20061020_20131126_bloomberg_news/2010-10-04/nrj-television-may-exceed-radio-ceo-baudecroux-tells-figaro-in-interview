French radio station operator NRJ
Group plans to start a women’s television channel and expects
its TV unit to grow to be larger than the radio-station
division, Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Paul Baudecroux  said in
an interview with Le Figaro newspaper.  The television unit, which has lost a total of 80 million
euros ($110 million) since 2005, is now breaking even, he said.
The company’s music-video channel, NRJ Hits, has passed MTV to
become the biggest cable and satellite music channel in France,
he said.  The executive also dismissed speculation that the group may
be sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
