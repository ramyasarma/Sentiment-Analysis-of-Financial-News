Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS
of the Czech Republic filed a request with the Polish antitrust
regulator for permission to buy Enea SA, Poland’s third-largest
power group, the watchdog said on its website.  Poland’s government that’s selling a 51 percent stake in
Enea said in August it shortlisted five companies to buy Enea,
without naming them. The deadline for final bids is tomorrow.  According to the regulator’s website Kulczyk Holding SA
filed a similar request earlier this month. The office returned
the request to Kulczyk on Sept. 22, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
