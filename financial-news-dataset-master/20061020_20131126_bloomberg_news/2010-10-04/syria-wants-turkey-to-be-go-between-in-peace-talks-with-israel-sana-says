Syrian Foreign Minister  Walid Al- Muallem  said his country wants Turkey to act as intermediary in
peace talks with Israel, as it has done before, the state-run
 Syrian Arab News Agency  reported.  Indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria, mediated by
Turkey, broke down in December 2008 when Israel began a three-
week military offensive in the Gaza Strip that it said was aimed
at stopping Islamic militants from firing rockets into southern
Israel. The previous round of talks had collapsed in 2000 over
the terms for Israel to return the Golan Heights, which it has
occupied since 1967.  To contact the reporter on this story:
