European stocks  declined for a sixth
day, the longest stretch of losses since January 2009, as
reports on U.S. home sales and factory orders failed to ease
concern about the strength of the world’s largest economy.  Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG led a retreat in auto-industry
shares as German car sales fell. Gas Natural SDG SA lost 3.6
percent after saying a ruling related to a gas dispute with
Algeria’s Sonatrach may reduce profit by as much as 450 million
euros ($619 million). Yara International ASA slid 4.2 percent as
UBS AG downgraded the fertilizer maker.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropped 0.5 percent to 257.74 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the lowest level since August.
The gauge fell the most in three months last week amid concern
the economy is slowing as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis curbs
growth, extending the slide from this year’s high in April to
4.8 percent.  “There’s concern still about an overhang, about a double
dip in the U.S.,” said  Philip Poole , the London-based global
head of macro and investment strategy at HSBC Global, which
oversees more than $400 billion.  National benchmark indexes fell in 14 of the 18 western
European markets today. Germany’s  DAX  and France’s CAC retreated
1.2 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.7 percent.  A government report today showed U.S.  factory orders 
dropped 0.5 percent in August, pulled lower by a pullback in
demand for aircraft. That compared with the 0.4 percent decline
projected by the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Home Sales  Data from the National Association of Realtors showed
pending sales of existing homes climbed more than forecast.
Signed contracts gained 4.3 percent in August after a 4.5
percent increase in July. The median forecast of economists
surveyed projected a 2.5 percent increase.  China’s non-manufacturing industries expanded at a faster
pace in September. A  purchasing managers’ index  released
yesterday by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
rose to 61.7 from 60.1 in August. The data follow a jump to a
four-month high for the manufacturing PMI announced on Oct. 1.  China will address “structural problems” and stabilize
its economy by increasing domestic demand, Premier  Wen Jiabao 
said in an interview with CNN broadcast yesterday. Wen said he’d
argued before the global recession that China’s economic
development “lacks balance, coordination and sustainability.”  ‘Not Enough’  “The data coming from China is positive, but it’s not
enough to ease concern on European and U.S. markets,” said
 Andreas Lipkow , an equity trader at MWB Fairtrade
Wertpapierhandelsbank AG in Frankfurt. “The kick-off of the
earnings season with Alcoa’s results should give the market a
direction.”  Alcoa Inc., the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, is due to
report third-quarter results on Oct. 7.  Preferred shares of Volkswagen, Europe’s largest automaker,
slid 3.6 percent to 83.36 euros, while Porsche AG sank 4.3
percent to 34.75 euros. Daimler, the world’s second-biggest
maker of luxury cars, lost 3.8 percent to 43.79 euros. A measure
of auto shares dropped 2.7 percent, the largest decline among 19
 industry groups .  German new-car sales in September declined 18 percent to
about 260,000 vehicles, the VDIK industry group said today.  Gas Natural  lost 3.6 percent to 10.37 euros after saying a
ruling related to a gas dispute with Sonatrach may lead to a
reduction in 2010 profit of as much as 450 million euros should
its challenges fail. Gas Natural said the decision of the
arbitration panel was “abusive” and the company is trying to
challenge it.  Yara Downgrade  Yara posted the third-largest decline in the Stoxx 600,
falling 4.2 percent to 256.6 kroner, as UBS downgraded the
biggest publicly traded nitrogen-fertilizer maker to “neutral”
from “buy.”  “Yara has performed strongly since mid-2010 spurred on by
stronger expectations for 2011 due to higher crop prices,” UBS
analyst  Joe Dewhurst  wrote in a report today. “This has
resulted in multiple expansion which we believe will contract
once crop prices retrace.”  National Bank of Greece SA, the nation’s largest lender,
climbed 2.5 percent to 7.38 euros as Evolution Securities Ltd.
upgraded the stock to  “buy”  from “sell.” Alpha Bank SA,
Greece’s third-biggest lender, jumped 7.2 percent to 4.77 euros
and EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA soared 5.1 percent to 4.50 euros.  Greece’s budget deficit will narrow to 7 percent of
economic output in 2011, about half of last year’s level, after
the government cut spending and raised taxes to secure a
European Union-led rescue and avoid default, according to a copy
of the government’s draft 2011 budget released today.  Actelion Ltd. increased 4.1 percent to 41.62 Swiss francs
as the Evening Standard reported that Switzerland’s largest
biotechnology company may be a potential takeover target. The
newspaper cited unidentified traders.  Wellstream Holdings Plc rose 2 percent to 789 pence after
the Sunday Times said General Electric Co. made a bid worth more
than 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion) for the oilfield-services
provider, citing unidentified people close to the matter.
Wellstream hired Rothschild & Sons Ltd. and Credit Suisse Group
AG as advisers, it said.  Saab AB rallied 4.8 percent to 99.55 kronor after receiving
an order for an airborne surveillance system worth more than 4.5
billion kronor ($667 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
