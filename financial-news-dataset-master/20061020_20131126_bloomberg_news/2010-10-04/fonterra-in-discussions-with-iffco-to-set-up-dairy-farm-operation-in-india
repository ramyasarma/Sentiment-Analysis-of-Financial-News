Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. , the
world’s largest dairy exporter, is in initial talks with Indian
Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd. to set up a dairy farm in
the nation.  “We are in exploratory talks with IFFCO about potentially
establishing a dairy farm operation in India,”  Kelvin Wickham ,
managing director of Fonterra’s global trade unit, said today in
an e-mailed statement. “However, it is early days and we do not
yet have any formal agreement.”  The project may cost as much as 10 billion rupees ($225
million) and support as many as 40,000 cattle, the Economic
Times  reported  today, citing IFFCO Managing Director U.S.
Awasthi. It will initially produce 1 million liters (264,172
gallons) of milk daily, the English-language Indian paper said.  The farm’s cattle will include 3,000 cows imported from
Australia and New Zealand and 10,000 local cows that will be
added every year for three years, the report said.  The partners have not applied for any formal clearance for
the farm, which will rely on the relaxation of a ban on the
import of milk-producing animals for commercial use, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
