China National Offshore Oil Corp.,
that country’s largest offshore oil explorer, and  Altona Energy
Plc  approved a A$40 million ($39 million) program to evaluate a
coal-to-liquids project in South Australia.  Units of the two companies are due to start the feasibility
study into the Arckaringa venture in the fourth quarter of this
year, Altona said in a statement today. The first stage is
likely to last 12 months. London-based Altona estimates it has a
7.8 billion metric ton coal resource at the Arckaringa Basin,
about 800 kilometers (500 miles) north west of Adelaide.  The joint venture is moving from a “conceptual and
planning phase” into “detailed evaluation and execution,”
Altona Chairman  Chris Lambert  said in the e-mailed statement.  Altona aims to convert its coal into transport fuels that
produce lower emissions than conventional fuels as Australia
seeks to tackle climate change, the company’s website shows.  State-owned China National Offshore is the parent of Hong
Kong-listed Cnooc Ltd., China’s third-largest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
