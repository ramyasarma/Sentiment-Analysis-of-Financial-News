Saudi Arabia, the largest Arab
economy, has held talks with international companies to build
its first nuclear and renewable energy city, a vice president at
King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy said.  “We have engaged the expertise and thinking of 14 of the
best architectural and design houses,” Khalid al-Sulaiman, vice
president for renewable energy, said in Jeddah today. Of these,
six are from Saudi Arabia, and the rest from Asia, Europe and
North America, he said.  Saudi Arabia is one of several Gulf Arab countries seeking
to develop nuclear energy to meet electricity demand that’s
rising at about 8 percent a year. The United Arab Emirates
awarded a $20 billion contract in December to a group of
companies led by Korea Electric Power Corp. to build four
nuclear plants, and Kuwait plans to build four reactors by 2022.  Saudi Arabia received bids from U.K. and U.S. engineering
companies due Oct. 2 for a pre-feasibility study of its nuclear
power program, the Independent newspaper reported yesterday. A
broad plan has already been drawn up by Poeyry Oyj, a Finnish
energy consultant, the newspaper said, without disclosing the
source of the information.  The kingdom, which holds the world’s largest oil reserves,
will have an energy ”mix in which nuclear and renewable
energies are viably integrated,” al-Sulaiman said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
