Australia’s Queensland state
government may not achieve a targeted sale price of more than
A$2 billion for the Port of Brisbane as buyers argue for a lower
valuation, the Australian Financial Review reported in its
Street Talk column, without citing anyone. Potential buyers may
include India’s Essar Group and Vedanta Resources Ltd. as well
as a group including Global Infrastructure Partners Ltd.,
Queensland Investment Corp. and Macquarie Group Ltd, the
newspaper said. Morgan Stanley and UniSuper Infrastructure
Partners Ltd. may also lodge a bid by the deadline, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
