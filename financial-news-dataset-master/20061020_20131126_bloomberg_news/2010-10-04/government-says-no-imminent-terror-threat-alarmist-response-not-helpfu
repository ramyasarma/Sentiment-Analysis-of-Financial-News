German Interior Minister  Thomas de Maiziere  said the government has no evidence of an imminent
terrorist threat, rejecting U.S. media reports that tourist
attractions in central Berlin are targeted as “nothing new.”  “There is no reason to be alarmist at this time,” de
Maiziere told reporters in Berlin today. The authorities have
studied all the available intelligence and “the conclusion
overall is that there’s no concrete evidence of imminent attacks
in Germany.”  The government takes any indication of threats “very
seriously and pursues it very intensively,” de Maiziere said.
While there remains a “high abstract threat” to German
interests at home and abroad, there is no need to step up
domestic security in public places, he said.  The U.S. yesterday warned Americans traveling in Europe to
be vigilant following weeks of discussion within the Obama
administration about threats of an attack by an al-Qaeda-
affiliated terrorist group.  De Maiziere, who spoke yesterday with Homeland Security
Secretary  Janet Napolitano , said that the U.S. issued travel
rather than a more serious travel warning. A report on Fox News
that a “Mumbai-style massacre” was being plotted by terrorists
targeting Berlin landmarks including the Brandenburg Gate and
the television tower is “nothing new,” he said.  “The targets of attack mentioned in American media today
were already mentioned over a year ago,” de Maiziere said.  While the intelligence authorities are sifting all the
evidence, “I cannot comment on all these measures so as not to
put them at risk,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
