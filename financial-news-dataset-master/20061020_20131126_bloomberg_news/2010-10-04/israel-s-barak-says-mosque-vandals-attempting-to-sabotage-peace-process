Israeli Defense Minister  Ehud Barak 
said that vandals who defaced a mosque in a West Bank village
south of Bethlehem last night were “terrorists” intent on
harming the peace process.  “Whoever carried out this act is a terrorist in every
sense of the word, and their intention was to hurt the chances
for peace and dialogue with the Palestinians,” Barak said in an
e-mailed statement from the Defense Ministry.  The mosque in Beit Fajar suffered fire damage and was
defaced with graffiti, army spokeswoman  Avital Leibovich  said in
a phone interview. Leibovich said the military viewed the
incident as “grave” and was making every effort to find the
perpetrators.  The attack comes as U.S. Middle East envoy  George Mitchell 
is trying to broker a deal to restart direct peace talks between
Israel and the Palestinians following the Sept. 26 end of
Israel’s 10-month moratorium on West Bank settlement
construction. Palestinian leaders say they won’t negotiate while
there is renewed settlement building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
