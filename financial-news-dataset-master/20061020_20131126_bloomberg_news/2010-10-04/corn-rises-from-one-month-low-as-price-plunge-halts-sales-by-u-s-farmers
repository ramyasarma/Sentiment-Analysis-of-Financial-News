Corn futures rose from a one-month
low as farmers in the U.S., the biggest producer and exporter,
halted sales after prices last week fell the most in eight
months.  Corn plunged 11 percent in the five days ended Oct. 1,
helped by a report that showed U.S. inventories before the
harvest at a four-year high and on expectations that drier
weather would help farmers speed up the harvest.  “Farmers have quit selling, and that gave the market a
bounce,” said  Brian Grete , the senior market analyst for
Professional Farmers of American newsletter in Cedar Falls,
Iowa. “Speculative selling stopped and end-users were stepping
in to buy some corn today.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 5.75 cents, or 1.2
percent, to close at $4.715 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $4.5425, the lowest
level since Sept. 3.  Prices also rose on speculation that the government on Oct.
8 will cut its estimate for this year’s crop after hot, dry
weather in August reduced yield potential, Grete said.  Production of corn, the biggest U.S. crop, will total
12.891 billion bushels, down from 13.195 million forecast in
September, FCStone Group Inc. said Oct. 1 in a report to
clients. Last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
predicted 13.16 billion, up from the record 2009 crop of 13.11
billion.  “Uncertainty about the size of the crop will keep the
market well supported this week,” Grete said.  The U.S. corn crop was valued at $48.6 billion in 2009,
government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
