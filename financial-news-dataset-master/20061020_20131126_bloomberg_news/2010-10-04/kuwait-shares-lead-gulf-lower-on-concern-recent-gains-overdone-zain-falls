Kuwait shares fell for the first time
in six days on concern recent gains are overdone, led by Mobile
Telecommunications Co., the company known as Zain. Dubai shares
dropped.  Zain  slid for a second day after HSBC Holdings Plc lowered
its recommendation on Kuwait’s biggest mobile-phone company. The
 Kuwait SE Price Index  dropped 0.6 percent to 6,947.10 at the
12:30 p.m. close in Kuwait City. The index gained 6.8 percent in
the third quarter. The  Dubai Financial Market General Index 
declined 0.5 percent and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  lost 0.4
percent.  Emirates Telecommunications Corp. , the biggest
telecommunications company in the Middle East by market value,
on Sept. 30 offered to buy 46 percent of Zain at 1,700 fils a
share. Kuwait’s Kharafi Group, the second-largest shareholder in
Zain with an about 13 percent stake, is inviting owners of fewer
than 300,000 Zain shares to join in the sale, according to an
advertisement in Al-Qabas yesterday.  “Attention is again on Zain,” said  Ahmed Talhaoui , head
of asset management at Royal Capital in Abu Dhabi. That “could
act as a short-term catalyst for profit-taking in Kuwait.”  Zain, which climbed 7.9 percent on Sept. 29 before the
Etisalat announcement, fell 1.5 percent to 1,320 fils. The
company was lowered to “underweight” from “neutral” with a
price estimate of 1,230 fils a share. “Minority shareholders
have nothing to gain from the deal with potential dividends at
risk,” HSBC analysts  Kunal Bajaj  and  Raj Sinha  wrote in a note
to investors today.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  lost 0.4 percent and Qatar’s
 measure  slipped 0.1 percent. Bahrain’s  measure  gained 0.5
percent and Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  rose 0.3 percent. Saudi Arabia’s
 Tadawul All Share Index  fell 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
