Police in the Himalayan nation of
 Nepal  blocked voting by Tibetan refugees for the exiled
government headed by the  Dalai Lama .  “Those refugees in exile have no right to cast ballots on
our soil, and we have confiscated their ballot boxes,” said
Ramesh Kharel, superintendent of police in the capital,
Kathmandu. “Our government has a one-China policy and we don’t
want any elements to speak against China,” he said today in a
telephone interview.  Video footage  posted on the website of Phayul, a Tibetan
exile newspaper in India, showed Tibetans yesterday shouting
protests as police in riot helmets and flak vests carried boxes
out of voting centers. Nepal has cracked down on Tibetan dissent
against China since 2008, when Nepal’s monarchy was overthrown
and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) became the main party
in the government.  “We are very disappointed to see Nepalese authorities
impinging on the rights of Tibetans to vote democratically,”
said Thubten Samphel, a spokesman for the  Central Tibetan
Administration , headquartered in the northwest Indian town of
Dharamsala. “We have not made any immediate representation to
the Nepalese government because we have to consider the
situation of the 20,000 Tibetan refugees living in Nepal,” he
said.  The exile government, which demands greater autonomy for
Tibet from the Chinese administration, is holding primary
elections among 120,000 Tibetan refugees for a parliament and
prime minister, and balloting took place yesterday in Europe,
North America, India and Australia, Samphel said.  Nepal’s legislature last week failed to elect a prime
minister in its ninth attempt since Prime Minister  Madhav Kumar Nepal  resigned in June amid a battle between the Communists and
other parties over the government’s composition.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Rupert
