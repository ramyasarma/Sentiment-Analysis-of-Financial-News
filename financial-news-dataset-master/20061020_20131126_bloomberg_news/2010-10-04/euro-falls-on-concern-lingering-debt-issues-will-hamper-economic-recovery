The euro weakened from a six-month
high against the dollar as Europe’s sovereign debt concerns
reduced demand for the region’s assets.  The single currency dropped against most of its major
counterparts after the Financial Times reported Ireland’s budget
deficit this year will be higher than earlier forecast, and
Nobel Prize-winning economist  Joseph Stiglitz  said the euro’s
future is “looking bleak.” Higher-yielding currencies such as
Australian dollar declined as a drop in U.S. stock futures
reduced demand for riskier assets.  “There are lingering worries over Europe’s fiscal and
economic situation,” said  Masanobu Ishikawa , general manager of
foreign exchange at Tokyo Forex & Ueda Harlow Ltd., Japan’s
largest currency broker. “This may lead to selling of the euro
and buying of the dollar and the yen.”  The euro fell to $1.3754 as of 9:56 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.3791 in New York last week, after rising to $1.3807 earlier
today, the strongest level since March 17. The euro was at
114.69 yen from 114.78 yen. The dollar was at 83.35 yen from
83.22 yen. The Australian dollar dropped 0.2 percent to 97.02
U.S. cents.  Stiglitz said the euro is under pressure because some
countries such as Germany are running trade surpluses while
Ireland, Portugal, Greece and others have deficits, according to
the Sunday Telegraph.  To contact the reporters on this story:
