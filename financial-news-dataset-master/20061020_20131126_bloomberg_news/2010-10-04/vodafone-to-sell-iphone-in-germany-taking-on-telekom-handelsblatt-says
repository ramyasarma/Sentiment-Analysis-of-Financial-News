Vodafone Group Plc will soon start
selling Apple Inc.’s iPhone in Germany, competing with Deutsche
Telekom AG,  Handelsblatt  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Deutsche Telekom’s exclusive distribution rights for the
Apple device will soon expire, opening the door to Vodafone, the
newspaper said, adding that both companies declined to comment.
Vodafone’s sales of the iPhone in Germany will start on Oct. 28,
handelsblatt said citing  Macnotes.de .  To contact the reporter on this story:
