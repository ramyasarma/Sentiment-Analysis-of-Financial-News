Corn slumped for a third day to a
one-month low after the Department of Agriculture said supplies
left from last year’s crop climbed to the highest level since
2006, and as dry weather speeds the U.S. harvest.  Inventories  on Sept. 1 rose 2 percent from a year earlier
to 1.708 billion bushels, the USDA said on Sept. 30. That was
322 million bushels above the agency’s Sept. 10 estimate. About
27 percent of the crop was harvested as of Sept. 26, up from 18
percent a week earlier, the USDA said last week. Corn gained 13
percent last month, partly on speculation output would decline.  “Not only was the report bearish but it was much more
bearish than expected,” said  Alex Bos , a grains analyst with
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in London. “The funds were caught too long
going into what the market was interpreting as a bearish report,
and now they’re moving out of those long positions. A lot of
funds are liquidating on the bearish surprise.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 6.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $4.5925 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at
10:09 a.m. in London. The price earlier today lost as much as
2.5 percent to $4.5425 a bushel, the lowest level since Sept. 3.
The contract tumbled the exchange limit of 30 cents on Oct. 1.  The grain surged 33 percent in the third quarter, the
steepest gain for that period since 1974. Corn had the fourth-
biggest third-quarter rise among 19 raw materials in the
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index behind sugar, wheat and cotton.  The price also declined on speculation that dry weather
will speed harvesting of crops in growing areas of the U.S.
Collection of plants is “going gangbusters” in the Midwest,
agriculture forecaster Telvent DTN said in a report yesterday.
The USDA will release a crop-progress report today at 4 p.m. in
Washington.  Dry Weather  “The next seven days will bring continued dry weather,”
with temperatures rising to more than normal by the end of the
week, Telvent DTN said yesterday.  In September, the USDA predicted a record corn crop of
13.16 billion bushels (334.3 million metric tons), up 0.4
percent from last year. U.S. soybean output will total 3.483
billion bushels, up 3.7 percent from a record 3.359 billion last
year, the USDA said.  Corn’s “downside risks” are “significant” because net-
long futures and options holdings are still 41 percent above the
peak in 2008, UBS AG said. “U.S. corn supply fundamental data
will become increasingly accurate as the harvest progresses,”
UBS analyst  Joe Dewhurst  wrote in a report today.  Soybeans for November delivery fell 7 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $10.50 a bushel. The price earlier today fell as
much as 1.4 percent to $10.42 a bushel. The oilseed lost 4.5
percent on Oct. 1, the biggest drop for a most-active contract
since July 2009. Prices fell 6.1 percent last week, the most in
13 months.  Wheat for December delivery dropped 7.5 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $6.475 a bushel in Chicago. The most-active contract
declined 9 percent last week, the biggest drop since the period
ended Jan. 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
