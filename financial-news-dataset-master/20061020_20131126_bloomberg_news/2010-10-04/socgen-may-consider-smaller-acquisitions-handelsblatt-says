Societe Generale SA  may consider
“smaller” acquisitions in international retail banking or
private banking,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview with
deputy Chief Executive Officer  Severin Cabannes .  Larger purchases like BHF-Bank AG from Deutsche Bank AG
aren’t an option at the moment, the newspaper said, citing
Cabannes. The sector faces an “industrialization of the banking
business” because of lower profit margins and tighter
regulation, the Handelsblatt reported, citing the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
