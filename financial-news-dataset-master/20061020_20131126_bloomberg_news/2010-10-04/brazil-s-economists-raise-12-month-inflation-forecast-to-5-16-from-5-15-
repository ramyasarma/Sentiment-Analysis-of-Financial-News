Economists covering Brazil’s economy
raised their inflation forecasts for this year and the next 12
months as credit expansion and job growth fuel domestic consumer
demand.  Annual inflation will end 2010 at 5.07 percent and stand at
5.16 percent in 12 months, according to the median estimates in
an Oct. 1 central bank survey of about 100 economists published
today. A week ago, economists had forecast rates of 5.05 percent
and 5.15 percent respectively.  Policy makers last month kept Brazil’s benchmark lending
rate at 10.75 percent, after raising rates 2 percentage points
at their previous three meetings on concern that above-potential
growth rates would undermine their annual inflation targets. The
central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  “The true risk to the inflation outlook is the fact that
the labor market remains very tight, and credit growth continues
to expand at a fast pace,” said  Virgilio Castro Cunha , head of
fixed income strategy at Bank of America in Sao Paulo.  Yields on interest rate future contracts due in January
2012, the second-most actively traded contract, fell three basis
points to 11.41 percent at 12:57 a.m. New York time. The real
strengthened 0.1 percent to 1.6876 per dollar from 1.6897 on
Oct. 1.  Demand, Price, Growth  Brazil’s unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent from 6.9
percent in July, the lowest since the government began
publishing the data in March 2002, the national statistics
office said Sept. 23. Bank lending rose 19.2 percent in August
from a year earlier, the central bank said Sept. 22.  Consumer price inflation  as measured by the IPCA-15 index
accelerated to 4.57 percent in the year through mid-September,
up from 4.44 percent in the year through mid-August.  According to the bank’s Oct.1 survey of economists,
Brazil’s economy will expand 7.55 percent, up from last week’s
7.53 percent estimate. This was the fifth straight week that
economists raised their 2010 growth forecast.  While economists surveyed by the central bank see faster
inflation over the next 12 months, they share the bank’s view
that consumer prices will ease by year-end 2011.  Policy makers in their quarterly inflation report published
Sept. 30 cut their 2011  inflation  forecast on the so-called
reference scenario to 4.6 percent, down from 5 percent in June.
Economists in the survey published today cut their 2011 forecast
to 4.92 percent from 4.94 percent.  The divide between policy makers and economists in the
bank’s survey stems from differing views on food price
inflation, said Castro Cunha, head of fixed income strategy at
Bank of America in Sao Paulo.  “The market is confusing this food price shock with a
broader trend on headline inflation,” Castro Cunha said, in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  Food prices in Sao Paulo last month rose 1.57 percent, the
FIPE research institute reported today, after falling for three
months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
