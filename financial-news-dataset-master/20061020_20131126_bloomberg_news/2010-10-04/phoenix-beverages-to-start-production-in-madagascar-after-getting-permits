Phoenix Beverages Ltd. said it will
start production in Madagascar in January after its associate
company, Nouvelle Brasserie de Madagascar SA, got permits to
operate in the country.  The board of Phoenix “strongly believes that this long-
planned market entry will provide PBL with both volume and
interesting profit opportunities,” the company said in an e-
mailed statement distributed by Cim Stockbrokers today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
