A plan to merge Tamweel PJSC and
Amlak Finance PJSC is off the table “at least for now”,
Tamweel Chairman Sheikh Khaled bin Zayed Al Nehayan said in
remarks aired by Al Arabiya television.  The plan to merge the two Islamic mortgage companies was
abandoned after Dubai Islamic Bank raised its stake in Tamweel,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
