Enel SpA ’s Green Power unit will
begin canvassing investor interest in its 3 billion-euro ($4.1
billion) initial public offering today, according to a note sent
to clients and obtained by Bloomberg News.  The investment banks are likely to start collecting orders
around mid-October and price the shares at the start of next
month, according to the note.  Enel Chief Executive Officer  Fulvio Conti  said on Aug. 23
he expects the Rome-based company to raise “at least” 3
billion euros from the sale of a minority stake in Enel Green
Power, its alternative energy unit.  The IPO, which is set to be Europe’s biggest initial share
sale since 2007, is part of Enel’s plan to reduce debt to 45
billion euros this year from 51 billion euros, partly through
asset sales.  Bank of America Corp., Banca IMI SpA, Barclays Plc, Credit
Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Mediobanca SpA, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit SpA and Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA are acting as joint bookrunners of the
deal. The shares will trade on the Milan and Madrid exchanges.  A spokesman for Enel Green Power declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
