Richards Bay Coal Terminal, Africa’s
biggest coal export facility, shipped 29 percent more of the
fuel in September than it did a year earlier as prices rose and
railway deliveries improved.  The port, on South Africa’s eastern coast, shipped 5.36
million metric tons in September, it said in an e-mailed
statement today. That compares with 4.16 million tons a year
earlier, according to its website. The terminal had stocks of
4.3 million tons at the end of last month, RBCT said.  Prices for the fuel shipped through the terminal rose 42
percent to an average $86.24 a ton in September from the same
month a year earlier, according to data from Hampshire, U.K.-
based research firm IHS McCloskey.  State-owned Transnet Ltd., which rails most of the coal
received by the terminal, said on Sept. 28 that the performance
of its coal rail line improved to deliver a record 17.7 million
tons during the three months through September.  Transnet’s monthly deliveries averaged 5.7 million tons in
each of July and August, rising to 6.2 million tons in
September, Transnet said last week. Deliveries to the terminal
rose by more than a fifth to 6.06 million tons last month from a
year earlier,  RBCT  said today.  At the September rate, RBCT would ship 62.7 million tons of
coal this year, it said. The facility has 91 million tons of
annual capacity after an expansion was completed this year.
Shipments totaled 61.14 million tons in 2009.  South Africa produced about 250 million tons of coal in
2009, or 4.1 percent of world production, making it the seventh
largest producer, according to an Oct. 1 report by UBS
Investment Research.  Anglo American Plc , Xstrata Plc, BHP
Billiton Ltd.,  Sasol Ltd.  and Exxaro Resources Ltd. are the
country’s largest producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
