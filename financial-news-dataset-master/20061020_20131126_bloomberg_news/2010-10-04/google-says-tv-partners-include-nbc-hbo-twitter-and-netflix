Google Inc. ’s TV service, debuting
this month on Sony Corp. and Logitech International SA devices,
will include content from Time Warner Inc.’s HBO,  General
Electric Co. ’s NBC, Netflix Inc. and Twitter Inc.  Google, which first announced the service in May, also will
feature TBS, TNT, CNN and the Cartoon Network channels, and an
application from the National Basketball Association, according
to a  blog posting  today. In addition to Sony and Logitech,  Dish
Network Corp.  has said it plans to deliver the service.  “This is just the beginning,” Google said on the blog.
“Over the next few weeks, you can expect to hear from more
sites that are enhancing their Web content for the television.”  The companies aim to capitalize on growing demand for
content that combines Internet features with television
programming. For  Google , the world’s most popular search engine,
the TV service provides a new way to sell advertising, which
makes up most of its revenue.  NBC will provide CNBC Real-Time, an application that
combines stock information and financial news. HBO will
contribute a service called HBO GO, which lets users access
shows on-demand. Other Web content partners include the New York
Times Co., Pandora Media Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Video
on Demand, which will offer access to more than 75,000 titles.  Google, based in Mountain View, California, fell $3.27 to
$522.35 at 4 p.m. New York Time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
 shares  have dropped 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
