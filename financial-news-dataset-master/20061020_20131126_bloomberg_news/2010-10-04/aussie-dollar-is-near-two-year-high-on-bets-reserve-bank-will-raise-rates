The Australian dollar traded within
one U.S. cent of a two-year high on speculation the Reserve Bank
will boost borrowing costs today.  The so-called Aussie has climbed 5.9 percent versus the
U.S. dollar since Sept. 1 as economists forecast the central
bank will raise the overnight cash rate target to 4.75 percent
from 4.5 percent. Reports today showed Australia’s trade balance
and retail sales grew. New Zealand’s dollar fell as the nation’s
business confidence dropped.  The RBA “is not saying anything to change its view that
growth is going to be above trend, and that’s going to threaten
inflation,” said  Ray Attrill , global research director at
Forecast Ltd. in Sydney. “The Aussie is going to have a knee-
jerk positive reaction from” a rate increase.  Australia’s currency was at 96.69 U.S. cents as of 11:40
a.m. in Sydney from 96.83 cents in New York yesterday. It
touched 97.51 cents on Oct. 1, the highest level since July
2008. The currency was at 80.78 yen from 80.71 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fell to 73.91
U.S. cents, from 74.18 cents. It reached 74.63 cents on Oct. 1,
the strongest level since Nov. 19. The currency was at 61.75 yen
from 61.83 yen.  RBA Outlook  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  signaled last month the biggest
mining boom in more than a century may prompt him to extend the
most aggressive round of rate increases by a Group of 20 member
nation to curb inflation pressures. Policy makers have left the
rate unchanged since May, citing European debt concerns.  There is a 73 percent  probability  the central bank will
raise borrowing costs today, according to swap indexes by Credit
Suisse Group AG.  Australia’s trade surplus widened to A$2.35 billion ($2.3
billion) in August from a revised A$1.74 billion in July, the
government reported today. The nation’s retail sales rose 0.3
percent in August, the government also reported.  New Zealand’s dollar declined, heading for its first drop
since Sept. 30, after a private report showed businesses became
less confident, adding to speculation the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand Governor Alan Bollard will keep interest rates on hold
on Oct. 28.  A net 6 percent of New Zealand’s companies surveyed expect
the economy will improve over the next six months, down from 18
percent in the second quarter, the New Zealand Institute of
Economic Research said today in Wellington.  “This soft report is all the more reason for RBNZ Bollard
to talk down the New Zealand dollar against the Australian
dollar,”  Annette Beacher , senior strategist at TD Securities in
Singapore, wrote in a research note today.  The New Zealand dollar fell 0.2 percent to NZ$1.3082
against Australia’s dollar. It reached NZ$1.3180 per Australian
dollar on Sept. 30, the weakest since April 7.  The yield on Australia’s 10-year note rose seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 5.07 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a
fixed payment made to receive floating rates, was unchanged at
3.73 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
