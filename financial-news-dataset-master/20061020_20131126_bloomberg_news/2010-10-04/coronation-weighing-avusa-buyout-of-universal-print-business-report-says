Coronation Fund Managers Ltd. is
evaluating the merits of  Avusa Ltd. ’s proposed purchase of
Universal Print Group Ltd. and Hirt & Carter Ltd. from UHC
Communications Ltd., Business Report said, citing  Karl Leinberger , Coronation’s chief investment officer.  Mvelaphanda Group Ltd.  which owns 25.5 percent of Avusa,
wants the deal scrapped on the basis that it has “no merit,”
the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. Coronation holds about 25
percent of Avusa’s stock on behalf of its clients, and together
with Mvelaphanda could block the transaction, Business Report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
