Romanian  producer prices  grew in
August after the government increased the value-added tax by 5
percentage points to meet the terms of an international bailout
loan.  The cost of goods leaving mines and factories advanced an
annual 6.7 percent, after jumping 6.9 percent in July, the
Bucharest-based  National Statistics Institute  said in an e-mail
today. Prices increased 0.4 percent from the previous month.  Romania, which is relying on a 20 billion-euro ($27.5
billion) bailout to stay afloat amid its worst recession in 20
years, raised the VAT to 24 percent from July 1 to meet an
International Monetary Fund-mandated budget-deficit target. The
tax increase boosted  inflation  to 7.6 percent in August, the
fastest in two years, from 4.4 percent in June.  Producer prices for manufactured goods rose an annual 7.6
percent in August, compared with a gain of 8 percent in July,
according to the institute. Prices of mined goods rose 2.5
percent after advancing 3.8 percent the previous month, while
electricity and gas rose 2.9 percent in August, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
