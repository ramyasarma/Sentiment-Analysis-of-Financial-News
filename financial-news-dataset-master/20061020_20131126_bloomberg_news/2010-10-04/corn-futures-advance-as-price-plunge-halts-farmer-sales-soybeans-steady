Corn rose from a one-month low as
U.S. farmers halted sales after prices last week fell the most
in eight months. Soybeans were little changed.  Corn futures plunged 11 percent last week, helped by a
report that showed U.S. inventories before the harvest at a
four-year high. Soybeans dropped 6.1 percent as rain boosted
soil moisture for planting in South America and on expectations
that drier weather would help U.S. farmers speed up the harvest.
The U.S. is the biggest producer and exporter of both crops,
followed by Brazil and Argentina.  “Farmers have quit selling, and that gave the market a
bounce,” said  Brian Grete , the senior market analyst for
Professional Farmers of American newsletter in Cedar Falls,
Iowa. “Now we see if we can hold the gains into the close.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 6.25 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $4.72 a bushel at 11:30 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $4.5425, the lowest level
since Sept. 3.  Soybean futures for November delivery advanced 0.25 cent to
$10.5725 a bushel in Chicago, after earlier touching $10.42, the
lowest level since Sept. 17.  On Sept. 27, the price reached an eight-month high of
$11.44 on speculation that rains would damage U.S. crops and dry
weather would delay planting in South America.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
