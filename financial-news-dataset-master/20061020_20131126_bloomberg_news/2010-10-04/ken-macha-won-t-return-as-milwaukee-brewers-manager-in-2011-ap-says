Ken Macha said he won’t be back as
the Milwaukee Brewers’ manager in 2011.   The Brewers finished the regular season yesterday with a
77-85 record and Macha told the Associated Press that the team
decided not to pick up his contract option for next season.  Macha, 60, had a 157-167 record with the Brewers, who have
made the playoffs once in the past 28 seasons.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
