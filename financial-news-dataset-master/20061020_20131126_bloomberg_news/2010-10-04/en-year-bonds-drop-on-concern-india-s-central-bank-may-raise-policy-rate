India’s 10-year  bonds  dropped for a
second day on concern the  central bank  will increase interest
rates for a sixth time this year to temper inflation.  An index measuring  wholesale prices  of agricultural
products compiled by the commerce ministry rose 16.44 percent in
the week ended Sept. 18 from a year earlier, the highest level
in almost two months, according to a Ministry of Commerce report
issued on Sept. 30. The yield on the benchmark bond has climbed
34 basis points in 2010.  “Investors are a little worried that the Reserve Bank of
India may raise rates once again,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-
income trader at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai.  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 rose three
basis points to 7.94 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.22, or 22 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 99.07.  The price situation in India remains a concern and the
central bank will respond to contain it, Reserve Bank of India
Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said on Sept. 29. The next
interest-rate review is scheduled for Nov. 2.  The central bank last raised rates on Sept. 17. The
 repurchase auction rate , at which it lends to banks, is 6
percent.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased to the highest level since October 2008. The rate, a
fixed payment made to receive floating rates, rose seven basis
points to 6.63 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
