Reports that militants of German
nationality were killed in a U.S. drone attack in the North
Waziristan tribal region of northwest Pakistan today could not
be confirmed by German government officials.  “We don’t have any confirmed information, so we can’t
comment yet,” Steffen Seibert, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief
spokesman, said in a telephoned text message.  “We are aware of the news agency reports and we are
investigating those reports,” the Foreign Ministry in Berlin
said in a statement.  As many as eight militants were said to have been killed
and two critically wounded in the missile attack, the Press
Trust of India reported, citing people with knowledge of the
matter.  The militants were said to be members of Jehad Al-Islami
and their deaths follow reports that a group of jihadists from
Hamburg is at the center of an Al Qaeda plot for coordinated
terrorist attacks in European cities, PTI said.  The Associated Press reported that the number killed was
five. It said the missile strike occurred in the town of Mir
Ali, which, it added, is known as a hub for foreign militants
with links to Al Qaeda.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
