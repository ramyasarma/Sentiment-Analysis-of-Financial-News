New Zealand consumers have changed
their attitude toward spending and are more focused on earning
before they purchase, and that’s what the country as a whole
need to do, Finance Minister Bill English said.  The tax package on Oct. 1, which lowered income taxes and
raised the rate of sales tax, will reinforce the change in
attitude and is one way that the economy can get on its feet,
English said in a video statement posted on the government’s
website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
