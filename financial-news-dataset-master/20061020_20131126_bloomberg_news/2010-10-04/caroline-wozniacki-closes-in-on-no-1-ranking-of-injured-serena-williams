Caroline Wozniacki  may take over the
No. 1 ranking in women’s tennis from an injured  Serena Williams 
at this week’s  China Open .  Wozniacki, a finalist in last year’s U.S. Open, won the
 Toray Pan Pacific Open  in Tokyo two days ago for a WTA Tour
record fifth tournament victory this year. The 20-year-old
righthander from Denmark, currently ranked second, will be No. 1
for the first time if she reaches the quarterfinals in Beijing.  Williams, 29, hasn’t played on the women’s tour since
capturing her 13th Grand Slam title at  Wimbledon  in July. The
American had foot surgery the same month after walking through
glass at a restaurant in Munich, she told  USA Today  last month.  As well as missing the U.S. Open, Williams pulled out of
tournaments in Tokyo and Beijing at the end of September, saying
that although she had made progress with her injury, she still
wasn’t ready to compete in Asia.  “In the meantime I am focused on my rehab program and
remain optimistic to return to competition this season,”
Williams said in a statement on the WTA Tour website on Sept.
25.  Williams, who also won the  Australian Open  this year, has
qualified for the season-ending  WTA Championships , which will be
played Oct. 26-31 in Doha, Qatar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
