The Bank of Japan may decide to buy
securities backed by lending to small and midsize businesses,
Nikkei English News said, without citing anyone.   The central bank may also decide to increase purchases of
long-term Japanese government bonds, the report said. Some board

rule that bondholdings be kept below the outstanding balance of
BOJ notes issued, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
