The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
meet a “tough resistance” near the 1,150 level and is unlikely
to have a strong direction for several weeks, according to a
technical analyst at  Swedbank AB .  “There’s likely to be tough resistance around the 1,150
level, which is the top from the high in January,” Stockholm-
based  Martin Hallstroem  said in a phone interview today. “We’ll
likely see a consolidation and trade sideways for the coming
weeks as investors wait for third-quarter earnings and more
macro data.”  The S&P 500 closed at 1,146.24 on Oct. 1. The benchmark
gauge for U.S. equities surged 8.8 percent last month for the
biggest September increase since 1939 as concern eased that
Europe’s debt crisis and U.S. unemployment will derail the
economic rebound.  Alcoa Inc. , the biggest U.S. aluminum
producer, is due to become the first Dow Jones Industrial
Average company to report third-quarter results on Oct. 7.  “The  relative strength index  was at levels around 70 two
weeks ago and has now come down to levels around 60,”
Hallstroem said. “Therefore, we are still at overbought levels
and it is a bit worrisome that we see a negative divergence
between price and momentum. This, together with the pattern of
the volume traded, makes us feel it might be hard for the S&P
500 to break out from this resistance right now.”  The RSI tracks the momentum of a gauge by comparing closing
prices with daily trading ranges. A reading above 70 signals to
technical analysts that the measure is “overbought,” while a
decline below 30 is an indication an index is “oversold.”  Technical analysts look at price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
