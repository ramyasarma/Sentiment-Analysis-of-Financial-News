Raw-sugar futures fell, capping the
longest slump in five months, as concern eased that drought will
damage crops in Brazil, the world’s biggest producer. Coffee and
cocoa also declined.  Most sugar-cane growing regions in Brazil got rain in the
past week, said Kyle Tapley, an agricultural meteorologist at
MDA EarthSat in Rockville, Maryland. More precipitation is
expected this week.  Expedito Rebello , the head of research at
Brazil’s Meteorology Institute, has said precipitation will help
harvests following a four-month drought.  “The Brazilian weather is potentially good for next
year,” said  Peter de Klerk , a London-based analyst at C.
Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd.  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.37 cent, or 1.6
percent, to settle at 22.99 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price dropped for the fourth
straight session, the longest slide since early May. The most-
active contract touched 22.49 cents, the lowest level since
Sept. 21.  The commodity has gained 43 percent since June 30.  “Sugar is taking a pause,” said  Jeff Bauml , a senior vice
president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a broker in New York.  In London, white-sugar futures for December delivery slid
$14.10 or 2.3 percent, to $606 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Raw and refined sugar prices have dropped 15 percent this
year.  Coffee Falls  In New York, arabica-coffee futures for December delivery
fell 8.6 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $1.725 a pound, the biggest
drop since Aug. 24. The price has gained 27 percent this year.  Robusta-coffee futures for November delivery dropped $91,
or 5.3 percent, to $1,634 a ton in London.  The robusta harvest in Vietnam, the biggest grower of the
variety, will be about 20 million bags, little changed from the
previous year, said  Andrea Thompson , an analyst at researcher
CoffeeNetwork in Belfast, Northern Ireland. That would result in
a global surplus of 2 million bags, she said.  “That’s a negative factor,” Thompson said. “That would
be the third consecutive year that robusta has been in a
surplus.”  Robusta beans, used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly
in Asia and parts of Africa. Arabica coffee is grown mainly in
Latin America and brewed by specialty companies including
Starbucks Corp.
A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Cocoa futures for December delivery dropped $47, or 1.7
percent, to $2,736 a ton in New York. The price has declined 17
percent this year.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery declined 21
pounds or 1.1 percent, to 1,847 pounds ($2,924) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
