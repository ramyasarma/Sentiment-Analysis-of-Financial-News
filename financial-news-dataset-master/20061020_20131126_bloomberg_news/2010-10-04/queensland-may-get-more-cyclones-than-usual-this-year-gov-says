Australia’s Queensland state, which
produces 95 percent of the nation’s sugar and is the country’s
largest coal exporter, may get more tropical storms than average
this season because of the La Nina weather pattern.  “We have a good chance of a cyclone crossing the coast
before the year is out,” Jim Davidson, Queensland regional
director, said in a  statement  on the Bureau of Meteorology
website today. As many as six storms may develop in the Coral
Sea, up from an average of four, the statement said.  La Nina occurs every three to five years and can last nine
to 12 months, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. The weather event can disrupt farm
output in Asia and intensify hurricane development in the
Atlantic Ocean. Australia is the world’s largest shipper of coal
and the third-biggest exporter of sugar.  Queensland’s cyclone season extends from November to April,
according to the  bureau .  To contact the reporter on this story:
