South Africa’s Public Investment
Corp.’s write down on a six billion rand ($863 million)
investment in construction company AfriSam was bigger than
previously estimated, the Business Day reported.  The investment is valued at 1.2 billion rand, a far bigger
impairment than the 2 billion rand writedown provided for by the
Government Employees Pension Fund, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said today, citing  Daniel Matjila , PIC’s chief
investment officer, in its annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
