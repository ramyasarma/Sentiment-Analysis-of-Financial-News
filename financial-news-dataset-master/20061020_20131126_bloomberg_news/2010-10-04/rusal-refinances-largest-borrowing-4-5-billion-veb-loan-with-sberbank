United Co. Rusal , the world’s largest
aluminum producer, said it refinanced its biggest loan, the $4.5
billion owed to Russia’s state development bank  Vnesheconombank .  Rusal repaid VEB, as the bank is also known, in full by
drawing on a $4.58 billion loan with  OAO Sberbank , the Moscow-
based aluminum maker said in a statement posted on Business Wire
today. State-run Sberbank’s credit, drawn on Sept. 30, has an
interest rate of 5 percent above the London Interbank Offer Rate
and matures on Dec. 7, 2013, with an option to review for a
further 1 1/2 years, Rusal said.  Rusal borrowed from VEB in November 2008 to repay foreign
lenders that helped it finance a purchase of 25 percent of  OAO
GMK Norilsk Nickel . VEB’s original one-year loan was extended by
a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
