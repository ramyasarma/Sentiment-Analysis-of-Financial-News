Wesfarmers Insurance signed an
agreement with Carbon Conscious Ltd. to offset the company’s
2010 emmissions. Carbon Conscious will plant 26,000 Mallee
eucalypt trees for Wesfarmers Insurance on marginal Western
Australian farmland to assist with issues of salinity and soil
erosion.  The trees, native to Australia, will store carbon over 30
years and be maintained by Carbon Conscious, the company said in
a statement to the stock exchange today. The trees help reduce
salinity and wind erosion on farms and contribute to the effort
to counter climate change, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
