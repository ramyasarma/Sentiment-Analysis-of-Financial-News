Visa Inc.  and  MasterCard Inc.  reached
a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department to resolve a two-
year antitrust investigation over restrictions on merchants.  The settlement was filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New
York, today as the Justice Department filed charges against
Visa, MasterCard and  American Express Co.   American Express spokesman  Michael O’Neill  said his company
would fight the charges. “We do not intend to settle,” he
said.  The U.S. probe focused on rules that bar merchants from
charging extra to customers who use credit cards and steering
them to competing cards, and that require retailers to accept
every type of card banks issue.  Attorney General  Eric Holder  announced he will hold a news
conference today in Washington at 2 p.m. to announce
developments in what the Justice Department described as an
antitrust case.  To contact the reporters on this story:
