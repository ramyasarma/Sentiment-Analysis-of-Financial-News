Four insurers -- Allianz SE, Zurich
Financial Services AG, Resolution Ltd. and RSA Insurance Group
Plc -- were in talks over bidding and breaking up Aviva Plc, the
Times reported without saying where it got the information.  The discussions, which did not come to fruition, involved
Resolution acquiring the domestic life and pensions business and
Aviva Investors, while RSA would have secured the general
insurance arm, and Zurich and Allianz would have divided the
European and Asian businesses, the newspaper said.     Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
