South Africa’s municipalities failed
to utilize more than 2 billion rand ($288 million) they were
allocated for roads, water treatment plants and other
infrastructure in the year through March, Business Day reported,
citing a government report.  Four percent of the 272 municipalities did not spend any of
the money they received from the national government for
infrastructure, while 15 percent spent less than half their
allocation, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
