Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.  “won’t shy
away” from acquiring information technology companies to
strengthen its software business, Vice Chairman  Anand Mahindra 
said in an interview with Bloomberg UTV today.  India’s largest maker of sport-utility vehicles may also
consider setting up an assembly unit in South Africa, he said,
without giving a timeframe.  Tech Mahindra Ltd., a software company controlled by
Mahindra & Mahindra, bought Satyam Computer Services Ltd., the
software exporter embroiled in India’s biggest corporate fraud
probe, from the government last year. Satyam’s former Chairman
 Ramalinga Raju  disclosed in January 2009 that he overstated
company assets by more than $1 billion. Anand Mahindra at the
time called the purchase a “very calculated risk.”  Tech Mahindra, which  owns  42.6 percent of Satyam, fell 0.4
percent to 764.60 rupees in Mumbai trading today. The stock has
declined 19 percent in the past year, compared with a 21 percent
gain in the benchmark  Sensitive Index.   Tech Mahindra plans to seek business in Africa, Anand
Mahindra said today.  The company, based in Pune, India, is in talks for several
contracts, each valued at more than $10 million, in Africa,
Krishna Gopal, vice president for Middle East, Africa and South
Asia sales, said in an Aug. 6 interview. Sales from the region
may reach about $45 million in the year to March as demand for
technology services from mobile-phone companies increases, Gopal
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
