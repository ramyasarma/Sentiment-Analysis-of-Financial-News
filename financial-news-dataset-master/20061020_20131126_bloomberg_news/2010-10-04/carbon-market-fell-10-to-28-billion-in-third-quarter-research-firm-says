The global carbon market fell to $28
billion in the third quarter from $31 billion in the year-
earlier quarter, according to estimates from Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  The decline of 9.7 percent was less than expected, Guy
Turner, New Energy Finance’s head of carbon, said today at the
Carbon Show in London. It’s “by no means down and out.”   To contact the reporter on this story:
