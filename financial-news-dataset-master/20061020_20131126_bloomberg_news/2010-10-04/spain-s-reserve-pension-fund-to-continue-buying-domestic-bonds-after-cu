Spain’s social security reserve fund
will continue purchasing domestic bonds after the country’s top
credit rating was cut one level by Moody’s Investors Service,
Deputy Minister for Social Security Octavio Granado said.  The rules governing the bond purchases say the fund must
acquire debt with “high” credit ratings, and it won’t be
affected by the loss of the Aaa grade last week, Granado said
today at a news conference in Madrid.  The fund was worth about 62.5 billion euros ($85.6 billion)
in the first quarter. Spanish debt will account for about 90
percent of the fund by year-end as it will only purchase Spanish
debt in 2010, the same as in 2009, Granado said in March. That
compares with 56.4 percent at the end of 2008.  El Mundo newspaper reported Oct. 2 that the fund wouldn’t
be able to buy Spanish government bonds after the rating cut as
the fund’s managers are only allowed to buy bonds with the
maximum credit rating.  To contact the reporters on this story:
