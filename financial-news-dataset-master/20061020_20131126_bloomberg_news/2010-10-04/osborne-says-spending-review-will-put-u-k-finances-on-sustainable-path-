U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne said publication of the government’s three-year
spending plans will put public finances on a “stable
footing.”  “We have restored confidence at home and abroad,” he told
Conservative Party supporters in Birmingham, England, today.
“Now we are a fortnight away from completing a fundamental
review of public spending that will put public finanaces on
stable footing for years to come.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
