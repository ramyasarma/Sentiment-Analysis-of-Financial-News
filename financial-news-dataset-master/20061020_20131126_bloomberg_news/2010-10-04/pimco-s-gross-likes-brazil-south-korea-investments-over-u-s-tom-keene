Bill Gross , manager of the world’s
biggest bond fund, said developing economies such as Brazil and
South Korea offer attractive investment opportunities as growth
in developed markets including the U.S. has slowed.  Brazil offers real interest rates of 8 percent to 9
percent, Gross, 66, said in an interview today on Bloomberg
Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with Tom Keene. The Korean
won is representative of “strong emerging-market currencies to
stand in contrast to the U.S. dollar,” Gross said.  Gross and  Mohamed El-Erian , co-chief investment officers of
Pacific Investment Management Co., coined the phrase “new
normal” in 2009 to describe the decreasing role of the U.S. in
the global economy. They forecast developed-market growth that
is below historical averages in the next three to five years as
economies struggle with mounting budget deficits and increased
regulation after the 2008 collapse of credit markets.  Gross, founder of the Newport Beach, California-based
Pimco, runs the $252 billion Pimco Total Return Fund. The fund
has advanced an average of 8.4 percent in the past five years,
beating 98 percent of similarly managed funds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
