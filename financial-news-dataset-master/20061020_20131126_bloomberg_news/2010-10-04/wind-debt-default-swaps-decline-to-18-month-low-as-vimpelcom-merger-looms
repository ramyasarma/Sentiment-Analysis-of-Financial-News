The cost of protecting Wind
Telecommunicazioni SpA bonds from default plunged to an 18-month
low on speculation a merger with Russia’s VimpelCom Ltd. would
give the company a parent with “deep pockets.”  Vimpelcom, Russia’s second-largest mobile-phone operator,
and Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris , who owns Rome-based
Wind through Weather Investments SpA, may say as early as today
that they are closer to agreement on merging their phone assets,
two people familiar with the matter said. The deal would create
an entity with a combined mobile subscriber base of more than
200 million customers.  “Wind is likely to be getting a parent that has relatively
deep pockets,” said  Tatjana Greil Castro , who manages about $1
billion of high-yield debt at Muzinich & Co. Ltd. in London and
is adding to her holdings of Wind’s 12.25 percent pay-in-kind
notes. “The bonds all have high coupons so Wind will be able to
improve its cash flow by refinancing them.”  Credit-default swaps insuring 10 million euros ($13.6
million) of Wind securities against default for five years fell
46 basis points, or 46,000 euros, to 481 basis points, the least
since March last year, according to data provider CMA. The
contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to debt agreements.  The company’s high-yield bonds also added to a week of
gains, prices compiled by Bloomberg show. High-yield debt is
rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by
Standard & Poor’s.  Wind’s 348 million euros of 12.25 percent notes rose to a
record 113.5 cents on the euro from 91.5 cents on Aug. 11, the
day before Russia’s Kommersant newspaper reported that Sawiris
and Vimpelcom were in talks, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company’s 11.75 percent secured bonds due 2013 gained
for a sixth successive day, rising 1.67 cents to 113.92 cents to
yield 8.96 percent. The company’s bonds were sold through Wind
Acquisition Finance SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
