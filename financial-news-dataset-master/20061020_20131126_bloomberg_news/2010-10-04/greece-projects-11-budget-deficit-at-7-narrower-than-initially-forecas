Greece’s budget deficit will narrow
to 7 percent of economic output in 2011, about half of last
year’s level, after the government cut spending and raised taxes
to secure a European Union-led rescue and avoid default.  The shortfall will decline to 7.8 percent of gross domestic
product this year from 13.8 percent in 2009, according to an e-
mailed copy of the government’s draft 2011 budget released in
Athens today. When it requested the rescue in May, the
government forecast a deficit of 8.1 percent this year and 7.6
percent in 2011.  Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou ’s budget seeks to
offset lagging revenue growth to trim the EU’s second-biggest
deficit and allow the country to resume borrowing on the
markets. In the first eight months of the year, revenue rose 3.4
percent, trailing the 13.7 percent pace Greece pledged to secure
110 billion euros ($150 billion) in rescue loans from the EU and
the International Monetary Fund. Revenue is now seen rising 8.7
percent this year, according to the draft budget.  “The sacrifices of the Greek people are not in vain,”
Papaconstantinou said after the Cabinet approved the draft
today. “This is yet another big step toward tidying up our
public finances and setting the foundation for stable growth.”
A final budget will be announced on Nov. 18, he said.  Investors demand a yield  premium  of 772 basis points to
lend to Greece rather than Germany for 10 years, the most of any
euro nation. That’s down from a euro-era record of 973 basis
points on May 7.  Staying the Course  Prime Minister  George Papandreou , elected a year ago today,
is trying to show investors that Greece can stay the course of a
deficit-cutting drive that has slashed wages and pensions and
led to street protests. Greece seeks to return to bond markets
next year after investor concerns that the country would default
on 300 billion euros of debt led to a surge in  borrowing costs 
and prompted the EU-led rescue.  The government’s new deficit forecasts are “an indication
of the great strides that it has made toward getting its public
finances on an even keel,” Ben May, an economist at Capital
Economics in London, said in a research note today. “But it is
still far too early to conclude that the Greek fiscal crisis is
anywhere near over.”  Crisis Levy  The spending plan includes 9.2 billion euros of deficit-
reduction measures, the equivalent of about 4 percent of GDP.
The government’s budget gap next year will fall to 16.3 billion
euros from 18.5 billion euros 2010.  Papaconstantinou expects to make 1 billion euros from
collecting a crisis levy from companies this year, compared with
an initial estimate of 600 million euros in May, according to
the plan. A shrinking economy will reduce income from luxury
items to 40 million euros from 100 million euros, while a
presumptive tax on professionals will bring in 700 million euros
compared with an initial estimate of 400 million euros.  Deeper cuts in state spending will bring in 400 million
euros, the draft budget showed. The government will also save
300 million euros from a public investment plan, less than a
forecast 500 million euros.  Spending on interest payments will mean a 2.2 percent
increase in the state budget next year, which doesn’t include
spending by local governments, hospitals and other enterprises.
Debt-servicing costs will rise to 6.8 percent of GDP next year
from 5.6 percent in 2010. Income for the central budget will
increase 6.9 percent, according to the plan.  Contracting Economy  The government is speeding up deficit-reduction while the
economy is contracting. The budget draft sees the economy
shrinking 4 percent this year and 2.6 percent next, in line with
previous forecasts. The IMF said in a report in September that
higher-than-expected inflation was boosting the nominal value of
Greece’s economy, which could help shrink the relative size of
the deficit this year and in 2011.  The forecast decline in the 2011 deficit “is based on a
projected increase in revenue in the state budget by 6.9 percent
and planned decreases in expenditures by 5.9 percent,” the
Finance Ministry said in a statement.  Debt is seen rising next year to 330 billion euros, or 142
percent of GDP, from 133 percent, or 313 billion euros, in 2010.
According to today’s draft, consumer-price growth will average
an annual 4.6 percent this year and 2.2 percent in 2011. The
jobless rate will increase to 14.5 percent in 2011, the highest
in more than a decade, from 9.5 percent last year.  ----With assistance from  Natalie Weeks  and  Christos Ziotis  in
