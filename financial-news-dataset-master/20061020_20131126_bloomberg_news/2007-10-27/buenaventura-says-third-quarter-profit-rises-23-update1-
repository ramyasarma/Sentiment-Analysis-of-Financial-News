             Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA  said
third-quarter profit rose 23 percent on surging gold prices and
higher income from a stake in  Peru 's third-largest copper mine.  
 Net income rose to $99.9 million, or 79 cents per American
depositary receipt, from $81.2 million, or 64 cents, a year
earlier, the Lima-based company said today in a statement. Total
revenue rose 35 percent to $195.8 million, topping the average
$189.8 million  estimate  of three analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  
 ``Buenaventura benefited from higher prices and sales and its
stake in Cerro Verde,'' Daniel Romero, a trader at Lima-based
brokerage Investa SAB, said in a phone interview. ``The company's
copper business is becoming increasingly important.''  
 Buenaventura's income from affiliates, including a
44 percent stake in Denver-based  Newmont Gold Corp. (NEM) 's Yanacocha
gold mine and an 18.5 percent stake in Phoenix-based Freeport-
 McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 's Cerro Verde copper mine, rose
4 percent to $67.8 million. Cash costs at Yanacocha rose
70 percent to $369 an ounce from $217 an ounce a year earlier.  
 Gold production fell 27 percent to 265,862 ounces on
declines at Yanacocha. Silver output rose 1 percent to 3.94
million ounces and zinc production doubled to 10,967 tons.  
 Buenaventura's ADRs, each representing one ordinary share,
rose $1.27, or 2.5 percent, to $52.84 in  New York  Stock Exchange
composite  trading . They have climbed 88 percent this year.  
 Rising Gold Prices  
 Buenaventura said it sold gold for an average of $692 an
ounce during the third quarter, up 28 percent from $542 a year
earlier. The company's silver price rose 10 percent to $12.62 an
ounce and lead almost tripled to $3,153 a ton.  
 Profit rose for the first quarter in four after posting
hedging losses in the past two quarters.  
 ``The company doesn't intend to keep reducing its hedge
book, which doesn't have ounces covered until 2009,'', Banco de
Credito analyst Claudia Cooper wrote in an Oct. 12 report. She
rates the share ``outperform.'' ``Annual profit should be around
$482.4 million.''  
 Buenaventura posted $428.1 million in net income in 2006.
