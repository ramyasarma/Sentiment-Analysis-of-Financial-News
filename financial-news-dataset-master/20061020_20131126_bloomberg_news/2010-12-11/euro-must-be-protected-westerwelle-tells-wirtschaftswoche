German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle  said Europe and the euro must be protected and
called on European Union states to coordinate fiscal and
economic policy more closely to overcome the region’s sovereign-
debt crisis,  WirtschaftsWoche  reported.  Germany must make sure to “keep the hand on our own
coffer,” he was cited as saying in an e-mailed preview of a
report to be published in the German magazine’s Dec. 13 edition.
The group of countries sharing the euro isn’t turning into a
“transfer union,” he was cited as saying.  The introduction of joint euro-region government bonds, or
eurobonds, is “not a convincing proposal,” Westerwelle said,
according to the magazine. He also said it’s important Germany
coordinates its position with France, WirtschaftsWoche reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
