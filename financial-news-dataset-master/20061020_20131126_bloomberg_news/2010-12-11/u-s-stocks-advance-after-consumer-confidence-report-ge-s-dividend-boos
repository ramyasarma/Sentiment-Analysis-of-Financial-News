comfortable with growth in 2011,” said  David Spika , a Dallas-

level that marks a recovery of 61.8 percent of its decline from
a record beginning in October 2007. The ratio, which corresponds
to proportions found in nature, is part of  Fibonacci  chart

and Wells Fargo & Co. indicated they may boost their payouts.  Citigroup rallied 7.2 percent to $4.77, the highest since
April. The U.S. Treasury sold its remaining stock for $10.5
billion, bringing the country’s third-biggest bank a step closer
to independence from the government following a $45 billion
bailout in 2008.  AIG rose 12 percent to $48.95, the highest since August
2009. The insurer that took $182.3 billion in a federal bailout

common stock, which will then be sold to private investors.  Tenet rose 55 percent, the most since at least 1980, to
$6.65. Community Health Systems made an unsolicited offer to buy

said.  McDonald’s fell 2.8 percent to $77.56. The world’s largest
