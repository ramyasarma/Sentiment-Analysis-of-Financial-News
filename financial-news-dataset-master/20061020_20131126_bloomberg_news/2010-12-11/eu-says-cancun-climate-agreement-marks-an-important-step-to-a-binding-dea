The European Union said the
agreement reached at a global climate summit today was an
important step on a “long and challenging” road towards a
binding treaty to tackle global warming.  Envoys at the United Nations meeting in Cancun, Mexico,
agreed after two weeks of negotiations to a climate-protection
package including a fund that would manage a “significant
share” of the $100 billion pledged last year in aid for poorer
nations and a plan to reduce deforestation.     “We have strengthened the international climate regime
with new institutions and new funds,” Climate Commissioner
Connie Hedegaard said in an e-mailed statement today. “All
parties should now take domestic action to reduce or limit their
emissions so that we can keep global warming below 2 degrees
Celcius.”   The next UN summit aimed at ironing out a global climate
framework for when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012 is
scheduled to take place next year in Durban, South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
