Eskom Holdings Ltd., South Africa’s
state-owned electricity utility, said the South Gauteng High
Court has found in the company’s favor in the case brought by
former Chief Executive Officer Jacob Maroga.  Maroga had filed an application for reinstatement, claiming
he had been unlawfully dismissed. Eskom said Maroga had offered
to resign and that his offer was accepted.  “The application was dismissed on the merits of Eskom’s
case, with the court finding that Maroga had resigned,” Eskom
said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
