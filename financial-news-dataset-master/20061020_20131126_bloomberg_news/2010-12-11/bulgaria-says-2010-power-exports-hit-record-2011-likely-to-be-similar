The National Electricity Company,
Bulgaria’s state-run power utility, sold a record 7,500
gigawatt-hours of electricity to other Balkan states this year
and expects to sell a similar amount in 2011.  This year’s power exports more than doubled from 2009, when
Bulgaria sold abroad 3,693 gigawatt-hours, Krassimir Parvanov,
the Sofia-based company’s executive director told a news
conference today. Exports increased as domestic consumption was
reduced by the recession, he said.  “We reached an all-time exports record this year,”
Parvanov said. “Mainly because we improved the management of
the tenders and our product.”  The average rate charged by the generator is around 45
euros per megawatt, he said. This brings the company’s total
export revenue to 337.5 million euros ($446 million) this year.
Power exports to Greece, Serbia, Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania
account for 21.6 percent of total demand, Parvanov said.  Bulgaria will start selling electricity to neighboring
Turkey in the new year once Turkey reconciles its transmission
system with Bulgaria’s, Parvanov said. The sale agreement with
Turkey is for 500 megawatts, he said.  The power utility may seek a 50 million lev ($34 million)
loan in 2011 if lending conditions are favorable, Parvanov said.
The company’s biggest debtors are the bankrupt Kremikovtzi steel
mill and Chimko, a chemical fertilizer plant, which owe 200
million lev and 40 million lev, respectively, he said.  Domestic power consumption may rise by 5 percent to 8
percent in 2011 as the country recovers from an economic
slowdown, Parvanov said. The government forecasts  economic
growth  of 3.6 percent in 2011 after an annualized growth rate of
0.5 percent last quarter.  The Russian-built Kozloduy nuclear plant produces about 35
percent of Bulgaria’s electricity, 47 percent comes from coal-
fired plants and hydropower plants supply 12 percent, the
utility said in November. Wind and solar account for the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
