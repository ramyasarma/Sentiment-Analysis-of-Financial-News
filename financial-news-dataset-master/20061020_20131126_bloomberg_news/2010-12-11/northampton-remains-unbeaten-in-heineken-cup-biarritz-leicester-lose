Northampton Saints beat Cardiff
Blues 23-15 to remain unbeaten in rugby’s Heineken Cup, while
Biarritz and Leicester Tigers suffered their first losses.  Northampton’s third straight victory keeps it three points
ahead of Castres, which beat Edinburgh 21-16, in Pool 1 of
Europe’s top club competition after three of six games.  Biarritz, last year’s runner-up, lost 28-27 to Aironi and
Ulster beat Bath 22-18 in Pool 4. Biarritz still tops the group
by two points over Ulster.  Leicester remained the leader in Pool 5 after its 24-19
loss to Perpignan. The Tigers lead the Scarlets, who beat
Treviso 35-27, and Perpignan by one point. Racing Metro defeated
Saracens 24-21 in Pool 2 in the day’s other match.  Defending champion Toulouse stayed undefeated last night
with a 28-16 win over Glasgow. Leinster, the final remaining
unbeaten team, plays Clermont Auvergne tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
