Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  is sending border police to surround a
Buenos Aires park where clashes this week between residents and
squatters have left as many as four people dead.  The area around the Parque Indoamericana park was to be
secured by border police as of 5 p.m. local time today, Cabinet
Chief  Anibal Fernandez  said. In recent days, residents in the
area have entered the park armed with sticks and guns in an
effort to force the squatters, some from neighboring Bolivia, to
leave.  Buenos Aires Mayor  Mauricio Macri  met with federal
officials last night and today at the presidential palace to
help resolve the situation.  The violence prompted Fernandez yesterday to announce the
creation of a ministry of security, to be led by Defense
Minister  Nilda Garre .  To contact the reporter on this story:
