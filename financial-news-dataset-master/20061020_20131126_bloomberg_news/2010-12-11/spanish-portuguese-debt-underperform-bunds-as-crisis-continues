Spanish and Portuguese bonds fell,
underperforming benchmark German bunds, as European lawmakers’
divisions on a potential joint security for the area eroded
confidence they will be able to end the region’s debt crisis.  Spanish bonds fell all five days last week after officials
from Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium and Greece said the proposal for
common bonds should be explored, prompting resistance from
Germany, France and Austria. German two-year notes slid as U.S.
Treasuries slumped amid speculation economic growth may hold up
next year, and investors bid for less debt than the maximum on
offer at a sale of German 2012 securities.  “The whole diversity of comments regarding ‘E-bonds’
really highlighted how far apart sometimes the high-profile guys
think,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at
Commerzbank AG in London. “The sell-off in bunds was due to the
spillover effects from the Treasuries market.”  The yield on the Spanish 10-year bond rose to 5.42 percent
yesterday afternoon in London, up from 5.08 percent on Dec. 3.
The 4.85 percent securities maturing in October 2020 fell 2.515,
or 25.15 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,322) face amount, to 95.685.  The two-year German note yield increased to 1.08 percent
from 0.86 percent, narrowing the difference in yield with 10-
year securities to 187 basis points, from 200 basis points on
Dec. 3, and as much as 208 basis points on Dec. 7.  European policy makers are grappling to find a solution to
the debt crisis that’s already pushed Ireland and Greece this
year to seek international bailouts.  EU Summit  Lawmakers are under pressure to take further steps at a
Dec. 16-17 summit in Brussels. French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said yesterday that “common bonds would make governments less
responsible,” joining German Chancellor Angela Merkel in
rejecting the proposal.  Spanish bonds may fall next week amid speculation auctions
may underscore rising concern Europe’s debt crisis is deepening.
The nation is due to sell bonds maturing in 2020 and 2025 on
Dec. 16.  German bonds handed investors a 6 percent profit this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds handed
investors a loss of 4.1 percent and Portuguese securities
dropped 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
