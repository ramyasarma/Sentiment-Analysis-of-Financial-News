Canada’s dollar slipped the most in
four weeks versus its U.S. counterpart as investors bet interest
rates will remain on hold until late next year after the central
bank said it will be careful about future rate boosts.  The currency reversed last week’s gain as the Bank of
Canada kept the benchmark  overnight lending rate  at 1 percent
for a second consecutive meeting and underlined threats to the
economic recovery from falling exports and Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis. Government bonds fell before a report next week
that may show a decline in labor productivity slowed. Crude oil,
the country’s largest export, dropped.  “It was notable that they acknowledged that the risks
increased in the outlook, and talked about the external
environment as well and the drag of less exports on growth,”
 Sacha Tihanyi , a currency strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia in
Toronto, said of the central bank.  The Canadian currency weakened 0.5 percent to C$1.0091 per
U.S. dollar yesterday in Toronto, from C$1.0039 on Dec. 3, when
it touched C$1.0003, the strongest since Nov. 11. It was the
biggest weekly drop since the currency fell 1.2 percent in the
five days ended Nov. 12. One Canadian dollar purchases 99.10
U.S. cents.  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, still rose for the week versus
10 of its 16 most-traded counterparts. It gained 0.9 percent to
C$1.3350 per euro amid concern Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
will broaden, and rose 0.3 percent to 99.45 cents per Australian
dollar on speculation that China will tighten monetary policy.  Third Quarter  Policy makers will hold Canada’s benchmark interest rate
steady through the first half of 2011 and raise it to 1.5
percent in the third quarter, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of 23 economists and analysts.  The Bank of Canada said in a statement as its kept rates
unchanged on Dec. 7 that the nation’s economy “appears slightly
weaker” than expected in the second half of this year and
exports “continued to exert a significant drag on growth.” The
Canadian dollar’s 29 percent gain against the greenback since
March 2009 was curbing orders for exporters.  Risks to Canada’s financial system have increased in the
past six months because of Europe’s debt crisis, global trade
imbalances and rising debt of local households, the central bank
added in its twice-yearly Financial System Review on Dec. 9.
Reduced investor confidence linked to indebted European
governments could hurt Canada by making credit less available
and more expensive, it said.  First Rate Boost  The bank also kept borrowing costs steady at its October
meeting. It raised the key rate a quarter-percentage point at
each of the three meetings before that, beginning on June 1,
when it became the Group of Seven central bank to raise interest
rates since July 2008.  The loonie has appreciated 3.7 percent this year in a
measure of 10 developed-nation currencies, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The Australian
dollar climbed 9.7 percent, while the greenback fell 1.1 percent
and the euro tumbled 9.5 percent.  The Canadian currency has moved between C$1.0374 and 99.78
cents per U.S. dollar since Sept. 30. It traded on a one-for-one
basis with the greenback on Oct. 14 and during the five days
that began Nov. 5.  ‘Continue to Hover’  “We still think the Canadian dollar will continue to hover
around here and test parity; we don’t think the Canadian dollar
is going to back up against the U.S. dollar until the new
year,” said  Blake Jespersen , director of foreign exchange in
Toronto at Bank of Montreal. “We have lots of interested
sellers between 1.0130 and 1.0150 and lots of interested buyers
at 1.0050 on down to parity, but we’ve been trapped in this
range.”  The loonie will trade at parity by the end of March and
weaken to C$1.01 per dollar through the end of third-quarter
2011, according to the median average in a Bloomberg survey of
32 economists.  Crude oil, which accounts for 21 percent of the Bank of
Canada’s Commodity Price Index, the largest single component,
fell 1.6 percent this week amid concern moves by the  People’s
Bank of China  to counter inflation will hurt demand for raw
materials. Crude for January delivery traded at $87.79 a barrel
in New York yesterday, from $89.19 a week earlier. It reached
$90.76 a barrel Dec. 7, the highest level since October 2008.  China ordered lenders for the third time in five weeks to
hold more money at the central bank after November lending and
trade-surplus figures topped analysts’ estimates.  Government Bonds  Canadian government bonds fell, pushing up the benchmark
 10-year note yield  12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to
3.30 percent. It touched 3.32 percent, the highest level since
June 22. The 3.5 percent security maturing in June 2020 ended
the week down 96 cents to C$101.61.  Canada will sell C$3 billion ($3 billion) of two-year debt
Dec. 15, according to a statement this week on the central
bank’s website. The 1.75 percent notes are due in March 2013.  Labor productivity fell 0.1 percent in the third quarter,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey before
Statistics Canada reports the data Dec. 14. Productivity dropped
0.8 percent in the period from April to June. The measure is of
worker output per hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
