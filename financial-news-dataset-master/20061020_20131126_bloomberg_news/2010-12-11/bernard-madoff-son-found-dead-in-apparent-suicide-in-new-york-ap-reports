Mark Madoff , a son of convicted con
man  Bernard Madoff , committed suicide today, his attorney
confirmed.  “Mark Madoff took his own life today,”  Martin Flumenbaum 
of law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison,
said in a Business Wire statement.  “This is a terrible and unnecessary tragedy. Mark was an
innocent victim of his father’s monstrous crime who succumbed to
two years of unrelenting pressure from false accusations and
innuendo. We are all deeply saddened by this shocking turn of
events,” Flumenbaum said in the statement.  Sergeant Kevin Hayes, a New York Police Department
spokesman, told Bloomberg News that a body was found at 158
Mercer Street in Manhattan, and police were notified by a family
member at about 7:30 a.m. He wouldn’t identify the victim
pending a medical examiner’s examination, and declined to
disclose the cause of death.  Mark Madoff and his brother, Andrew, were under
investigation but hadn’t faced any criminal charges in the
massive Ponzi scheme that led to their father’s jailing, AP
reported.  Bernard Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year sentence at a
federal prison in North Carolina. At the time of his arrest,
Madoff’s account statements reflected 4,900 accounts with $65
billion in nonexistent balances. Investors lost about $20
billion in principal.  Residents of the Manhattan address, listed as that of Mark
D. Madoff, couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
