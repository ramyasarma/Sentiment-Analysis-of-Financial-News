European Central Bank governing
council member  Christian Noyer  said countries pay a higher price
for defaulting on debt than by repaying it, reinforcing the ECB
view that euro nations should rule out financial restructuring.  “People forget to look at what happens when a country
defaults, which is something I have been studying for several
decades,” Noyer said today in a speech in Paris. “Financial
markets make you pay for the default with higher interest rates.
They make you pay for the present value of losses, plus a big
premium with the uncertainty linked to that. You pay much more
by defaulting than by not defaulting.”  Debate over whether countries such as Greece and Ireland
can or should meet their commitments to bondholders has roiled
financial markets in recent weeks as they struggle to sustain
debt burdens that will equal or exceed 100 percent of gross
domestic product in coming years.  Germany led the push for bondholders to share the cost of
addressing sovereign debt problems, causing a jump in borrowing
costs for heavily indebted European countries. The position was
later watered down, when European Union finance ministers agreed
that any debt restructurings would have to be considered on a
“case by case” basis, rather than made automatic in the event
of bailouts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
