Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. , Australia’s
largest gambling company, intends to invest A$625 million ($616
million) to revamp three Queensland state casinos, a more than
threefold increase from its initial plan announced in October.  Tabcorp boosted the investment from A$175 million after
signing an agreement with the Queensland government on a package
of concessions, the Melbourne-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. The plan must gain regulatory approval.  The Queensland spending, which follows an A$860 million
refurbishment of  Star City  in Sydney, is expected to boost
revenue and “improve the growth prospects of the casinos,” the
company said. Australians gamble more than A$17 billion a year,
or about A$1,123 a person, according to the Queensland state
government’s Office of Economic and Statistical Research.  Tabcorp plans to separate its casinos from its betting
shops in a spinoff that’s due to be completed in July 2011, the
company said in October.  Tabcorp  declined 0.3 percent yesterday
to A$7.19 in Sydney, valuing the company at A$4.7 billion.  Queensland will allocate 500 poker machines for the Gold
Coast and Brisbane casinos, the state government said in a
separate statement today. Those will come from the existing,
unallocated pool of licenses, “so there will be no increase
overall in poker machines in Queensland,” the government said.  Queensland, starting in July 2012, plans to adjust the
current tax rates -- including lowering the hotel tax rate to 35
percent from 35.91 percent and reducing the rate for clubs to 35
percent -- so that the total revenue generated from gaming
machines won’t increase, the government said.  About 3,000 construction jobs will be created and another
1,400 jobs may be formed when it’s finished, the state said. The
investment also would add hotel rooms for international and
local tourists if a bid for the 2018 Commonwealth Games succeeds,
Queensland’s Premier  Anna Bligh  said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
