Treasuries plummeted, pushing the
 yield  on the benchmark 10-year note up the most since August
2009, as traders speculated President  Barack Obama ’s agreement
to extend tax cuts will accelerate economic growth.  The yield rose to a six-month high as reports this week
showed consumer confidence climbed and a boost in exports shrank
the trade deficit more than economists forecast. Central bank
policy makers prepared to meet on Dec. 14 after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said purchases of government debt may
be increased beyond the $600 billion announced last month.  “The sell-off was sparked by the tax policy shift that has
raised growth expectation for the economy and raised the amount
of money that will need to be raised over the next decade, both
of which are negatives for Treasuries,” said  Eric Lascelles ,
chief rates strategist and economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s
TD Securities unit in Toronto.  The yield on the 10-year note climbed 31 basis points, or
0.31 percentage point, according to BGCantor Market Data. The
price of the 2.625 percent security maturing in November 2020
dropped 2 15/32, or $24.69 per $1,000 face amount, to 94 1/4.  The  yield  rose yesterday to 3.33 percent, the highest level
since June 4. The increase was the biggest since it gained 37
basis points during the five days ended Aug. 7, 2009, when the
Labor Department’s payrolls report showed lower-than-forecast
job losses.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
from a net-short position to a net-long position in 30-year bond
 futures  in the week ending Dec. 7, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission figures released yesterday.  Long Positions  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 19,508 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Last week, traders were net-short 12,071
contracts.  Bonds fell this week after Obama agreed on Dec. 6 to a two-
year extension of current tax rates in exchange for another 13
months of federal unemployment insurance for the long-term
jobless and cutting the payroll tax by $120 billion for a year.  Pacific Investment Management Co., which manages the
world’s biggest bond fund, raised its forecast for U.S. growth
next year as policy makers pump a “massive amount” of stimulus
into the economy, Chief Executive Officer Mohamed El-Erian said
in a telephone interview on Dec. 9.  Pimco expects the economy to grow 3 percent to 3.5 percent
in the fourth quarter of next year from the same period of this
year. That compares with its previous estimate for 2 percent to
2.5 percent growth, and the 2.2 percent gain forecast for this
year by the International Monetary Fund.  Thirty-Year Bond  The 30-year bond yield rose 12 basis points to 4.43 percent
after touching 4.50 percent on Dec. 8, the highest level since
May 13. The yield on the two-year note advanced 17 basis points
to 0.64 percent in the biggest weekly increase since Jan 1.  “This is a Treasury market that is better able to trade
based on economic reports going forward,” said  William O’Donnell , head U.S. government bond strategist in Stamford,
Connecticut, at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc’s RBS Securities
Inc., a primary dealer. He spoke yesterday in a Bloomberg Radio
interview with  Kathleen Hays  on the “Hays Advantage.”  The central bank is preparing to meet after announcing last
month a second round of debt buying through June under the
policy known as quantitative easing. The Fed expects to reinvest
$250 billion to $300 billion of proceeds from mortgage-backed
debt and agency securities into Treasuries during that time.  The Fed will purchase about $105 billion of Treasuries
during the next month, the New York Fed said in a schedule
posted yesterday on its  website .  Bernanke’s View  Buying more U.S. government bonds than already announced is
“certainly possible,” Bernanke said in an interview broadcast
Dec. 5 on CBS Corp.’s “60 Minutes” program. “It depends on
the efficacy of the program” and the outlook for inflation and
the economy, Bernanke said.  The trade deficit narrowed 13 percent to $38.7 billion,
less than the lowest estimate of 78 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News and the smallest since January, Commerce
Department figures showed yesterday in Washington. Exports were
the strongest since August 2008 as Mexico and China bought
record amounts of U.S. products.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of  consumer sentiment  increased to 74.2 in December from
71.6 in the previous month. The median forecast of 67 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for an advance to 72.5.  A 30-year bond yield near a seven-month high buoyed the $13
billion auction of the debt on Dec. 9. The bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
debt offered, was 2.74, the highest since the Aug. 12 sale. The
$32 billion 3-year note auction on Dec. 7 attracted the lowest
bid-to-cover ratio since February. The Treasury sold $21 billion
of 10-year notes on the following day at a yield of 3.34
percent, the highest in seven months.  There won’t be another round of note offerings until the
Treasury sells 2-, 5-and 7-year debt starting Dec. 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
