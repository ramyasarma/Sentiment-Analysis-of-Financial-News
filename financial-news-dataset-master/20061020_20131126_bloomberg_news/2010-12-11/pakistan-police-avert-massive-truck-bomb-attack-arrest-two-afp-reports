Police in northwestern Pakistan
seized a pick-up truck packed with a ton of explosives, averting
an attack that could have caused “massive” destruction, Agence
France Presse reported, citing police.  Dilawar Bangash, a local police chief in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
province, told AFP the attackers intended to use the truck bomb
to target religious processions in the city of Kohat marking the
Islamic holy month of Muharram. Two suspects were arrested, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
