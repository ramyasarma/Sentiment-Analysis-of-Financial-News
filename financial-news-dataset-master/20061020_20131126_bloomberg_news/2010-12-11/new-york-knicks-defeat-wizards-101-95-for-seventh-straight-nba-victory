Amar’E Stoudemire  scored a game-high
36 points and grabbed 10 rebounds as the New York Knicks
defeated the Washington Wizards 101-95 for their seventh
straight National Basketball Association win.  The Knicks (15-9) are four games behind the leading Boston
Celtics (18-4) in the five-team Eastern Conference Atlantic
division. Their seven-game winning streak is the longest since
the 2000-01 season.  Stoudemire was one five Knicks starters to score in double
digits last night at Verizon Center in Washington.  Wilson Chandler  and  Danilo Gallinari  each added 16 points.  Stoudemire became the second Knicks player to score 30
points in seven consecutive games, tying a record set by Willie
Naulls in 1962.  The Knicks had a 54-49 deficit at halftime. With 32 seconds
left in the third quarter,  Raymond Felton  scored from 25 feet
out for three points to put New York up 76-73, a lead it would
keep until the end of the game.  Gilbert Arenas  scored 20 points for the Wizards (6-16)
while  Nick Young  came off the bench to add 17 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
