OPEC maintained current oil
production quotas at its meeting today in Quito, Ecuador, as
member nations consider the global recovery strong enough to
withstand price gains.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
accounts for 40 percent of global supply, maintained the quota
of 24.845 million barrels a day for 11 of its members, which
hasn’t changed since it was agreed in December 2008.  OPEC President  Wilson Pastor  told reporters the group left
quotas unchanged after ministers held a closed-door meeting that
lasted more than 90 minutes. The decision was widely expected
and four nations didn’t send oil ministers to the conference.  Earlier today, Saudi Arabia Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  told
reporters that oil supply and demand are in balance and that
“$70 to $80 is a good price.” He declined to comment on
current prices.  Crude futures settled yesterday at $87.79 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.  Venezuelan Energy and Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said
after the meeting that $100 a barrel is a “fair” price and he
expects that level to be reached next year.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  OPEC’s next scheduled meeting is in June next year, at its
Vienna headquarters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
