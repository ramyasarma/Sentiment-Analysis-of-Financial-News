Regal Petroleum Plc , the U.K.
explorer that put all its drilling operations on hold pending a
strategic review, said it received a 24 pence-per-share offer
from Energees Management Ltd.  The offer “provides greater value and certainty to Regal
shareholders than the company remaining an independent listed
entity at this time,” Regal said in an e-mailed statement.  “Against the background of operational, legal and funding
challenges faced by the company, and following the results of
our strategic review,” the board “intends unanimously to
recommend shareholders accept the proposed offer,” Regal
Chairman  Keith Henry  said in the statement.  Regal slumped to a record in September after Chief
Executive Officer  David Greer  quit and as gas wells in Ukraine
failed to stabilize output. The producer plugged a well in
Ukraine last month after being unable to pull drilling equipment
out of the hole.  Regal said in June it was in talks with Ukraine after
receiving an order to suspend operations because of its
compliance with legislation. A court injunction overturned the
order the following month.  Energees is jointly controlled by Vadim Novinskiy and
Andrey Klyamko, and is the principal holding company of the
Smart Holding Group.  Regal shares  rose  31.1 percent to 24.25 pence at the close
in London yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
