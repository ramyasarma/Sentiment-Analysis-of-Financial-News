Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan is
set to propose banking industry changes today allowing home
buyers to switch mortgage providers without penalties, the Sun-

to take effect July 1, giving the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission more power and bolstering credit unions and
building societies as a “fifth pillar” of the banking system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
