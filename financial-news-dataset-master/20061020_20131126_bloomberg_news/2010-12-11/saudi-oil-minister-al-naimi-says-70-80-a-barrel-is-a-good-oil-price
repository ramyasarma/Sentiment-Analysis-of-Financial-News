Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali al- Naimi  told reporters that $70 to $80 a barrel is a good price
for oil. He spoke before ministers from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries began a closed-door meeting in
Quito, Ecuador, to decide on OPEC policy and production quotas.  He made the following comments.  On oil prices:  “Prices go up, prices go down.”  “How many times do I have to tell you. $70 to $80 is a
good price.”  He declined to comment on the current price, which is near
$88 a barrel in New York.  On supply and demand:  “Fundamentals are good. The market is in balance right
now.”  On why OPEC should leave output unchanged:  “Why do you want to disturb the market. It is in balance,
everyone is happy, the producers and consumers, why do you ask
all these questions that will cause a disturbance in the
market?”  “The market is in good shape. It is in balance, it is
stable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
