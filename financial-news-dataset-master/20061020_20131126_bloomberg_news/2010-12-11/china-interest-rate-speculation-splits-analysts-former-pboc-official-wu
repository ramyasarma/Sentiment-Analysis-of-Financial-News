China can’t raise interest rates
because of the risk of attracting inflows of cash that would
fuel inflation, said  Wu Xiaoling , a former deputy governor of
the central bank.  “The global low interest-rate environment prevents China’s
central bank from raising interest rates,” Wu said in a speech
at a hedge fund conference in Shanghai today. Emerging markets
face capital inflows and “excessive money supply is one of the
important reasons for China’s inflation,” she added.  Economists at firms including Australia and New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. and UBS AG. have, in contrast with Wu’s view,
said that China is likely to raise rates this weekend. China’s
central bank yesterday increased lenders’ reserve requirements
for the sixth time this year as part of efforts to curb
inflation that rose to a 28-month high in November.  In October, the central bank pushed up lending and deposit
rates for the first time since 2007.  Analysts have focused on the possibility of another
increase this weekend because of today’s release of November
data. Consumer prices rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier and
producer prices jumped 6.1 percent, a statistics bureau report
showed.  Wu, the deputy director of the Financial and Economic
Affairs Committee of the National People’s Congress, said  M2 ,
the broadest measure of money supply, may rise 19 percent this
year.  -- Zhang Shidong . Editors:  Paul Panckhurst ,  John Liu .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
