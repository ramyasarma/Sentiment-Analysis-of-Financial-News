Ambassador Richard Holbrooke “is in
critical condition and has been joined by his family” following
heart surgery at George Washington University Hospital in
Washington, Philip J. Crowley, State Department spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement.  Doctors this morning “completed surgery to repair a tear
in his aorta,” the statement said. Holbrooke, the U.S. special
envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, was admitted to the hospital
yesterday after falling ill while working yesterday at the State
Department headquarters.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
