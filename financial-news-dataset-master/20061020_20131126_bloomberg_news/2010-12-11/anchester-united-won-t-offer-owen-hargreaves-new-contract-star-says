Manchester United won’t offer a new
contract to injured midfielder Owen Hargreaves, the Daily Star
said.  Hargreaves, 29, has been plagued by injury since joining
United from Bayern Munich for 18 million pounds ($28 million) in
2007. His contract expires after this season and United will try
to move him for nothing in next month’s transfer period if it
can agree compensation over the final six months of the deal,
the Star said.  Hargreaves made his first start in over two years last
month, but lasted just five minutes before tearing a hamstring.
He’s currently in Germany seeing a specialist about the injury,
the Star said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
