Syria plans to spend $800 million to
develop ports and ships by 2015 as it aims to benefit from the
reconstruction process in neighboring Iraq.  The government’s five-year plan will expand the Lattakia
container terminal, buy new ships, develop existing dry docks
and build two new ones, Transport Minister  Yarub Sulayman Badr 
told reporters today during a conference in the coastal city of
Lattakia.  In the previous five-year plan, which ends this year, the
government spent about $200 million on maritime infrastructure,
he said.  An international consultant will be appointed to prepare
tender documents for the development of the Lattakia port, its
director general, Suleiman Baloush, said during the conference.
He did not give a timeframe for the tendering process.  The project will aim to increase the Lattakia port capacity
to 2.5 million 20-foot-equivalent-unit containers by 2015, with
a total bulk of 20 million tons per year, he said. In 2009, the
port handled 625,865 containers, with a bulk of 9.56 million
tons for the year, he said.  “All studies show that we need to expand Lattakia port
because of the growing demand due to the reconstruction in
Iraq,” he said.  Syria aims to attract as much as $55 billion in foreign
direct investment over the next five years, with almost half of
that earmarked for infrastructure projects, Deputy Prime
Minister for Economic Affairs  Abdallah Dardari  said Sept. 24.  The International Monetary Fund has urged Syria to quicken
its transition to a market-based economy while reducing its
dependence on the oil industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
