Madagascar ’s southern regions face
food shortages after a two-year drought, leaving 720,000 people
at risk of starvation, Agence France-Presse reported, citing
World Food Programme representative Krystyna Bednarska.  Residents of villages in the Atsimo Andrefana, Androy and
Anosy regions of the Indian Ocean island nation have depleted
food stocks and are eating cactus leaves to survive, AFP
reported. Southern Madagascar is prone to food shortages between
October and March, the period between harvesting seasons,
according to the news agency.  Madagascar is the world’s  fourth-largest  island and
produces about a third of the world’s vanilla.  To contact the reporter on this story:
