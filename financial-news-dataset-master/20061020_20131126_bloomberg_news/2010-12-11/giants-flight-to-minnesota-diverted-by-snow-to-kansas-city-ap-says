The New York Giants’ flight to
tomorrow’s National Football League game in Minnesota was
diverted to Kansas City by a blizzard, the Associated Press
reported.  The Minneapolis-St. Paul airport was closed hecause of
heavy snow and high winds, forcing the Giants to Missouri, AP
said, citing team spokesman Pat Hanlon. The team will spend the
night in Kansas City and plans to fly to Minnesota in the
morning, AP said.  The game between the Giants and Vikings at the Metrodome
was still scheduled to start at 1 p.m. New York time, AP said,
citing NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
