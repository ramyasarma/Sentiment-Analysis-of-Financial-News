French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said a world with a single reserve currency is
vulnerable to economic crises, underlining the need for more
global policy coordination in the face of trade imbalances.  “The fact that there is only one reserve asset but several
economic areas is a source of vulnerability,” Lagarde said in a
speech in Paris today. “It leaves us exposed to financial
turmoil in the event of fast depreciation.”  The dollar’s role as the linchpin of the global monetary
system has come under attack from some policy makers since the
2008 financial crisis. Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People’s
Bank of China, has proposed that the International Monetary Fund
take over leadership of the global monetary system from the U.S.  Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  has also questioned the
role of the dollar and his government aims to diversify its
reserves, the world’s third biggest, and promote the use of
regional currencies in international trade and finance to reduce
risks posed by the dominance of the dollar.  The remarks, made at a conference organized by the  Re-
Inventing Bretton Woods Committee , reflect French thinking at a
time when President  Nicolas Sarkozy  holds the chairmanship of
the Group of 20 nations that are trying to set global economic
policy in the wake of the financial crisis. France is aiming to
foster discussion about the monetary system rather than impose a
specific vision, Lagarde said.  No Magic  “France does not have the ambition to provide ready-made
solutions,” Lagarde said. “We don’t have a magic wand, we
don’t have a philosopher’s stone. You are going to participate
in that decision,” she told the audience of central bankers,
economists, academics and government officials from around the
world.  Reducing trade imbalances that are blamed in part for the
2008 financial crisis, together with setting out a new framework
for a global monetary system are among the top priorities of the
G-20. Heads of government of the group gathered for the first
time in November 2008 in Washington as the world grappled with
the after-effects of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. and the injection of billions of taxpayer money into the
banking systems of the U.S., Britain and other countries.  The existence of one reserve currency wouldn’t be a problem
if that currency remained stable, Lagarde said. In recent years,
though, increasingly volatile foreign exchange markets are
undermining global economic growth and proving a growing
challenge for companies that are trying to trade beyond their
own borders.  Safety Net  Lagarde also repeated France’s view that one possible way
to address trade imbalances would be to offer a financial safety
net to developing countries. The volatility of exchange rates
and capital flows has disproportionally threatened emerging
market economies in recent years, Lagarde said, prompting them
to accumulate massive reserves, distorting trade patterns and
the global economy.                             “Emerging economies are the first victims of this lack of
limits on capital-flow volatility,” she said. That “creates a
need for self insurance through reserve accumulation, which
itself contributes to global imbalances. It leads to sub-optimal
capital allocation and makes it much harder for an emerging
country to issue local currency denominated debt, therefore
leaving it more exposed to exchange rate fluctuations,” she
said.  Coordination between governments is essential for
confronting the problem in the French government’s view. “We
cannot operate in a vacuum, we are all interdependent,” Lagarde
said.  The Group of Seven nations is no longer the ideal forum for
managing the global monetary system, she added. “Currency
issues use to be dealt with at G-7 level,” Lagarde said. “Is a
G-7 that doesn’t include the second-largest economy in the
world” the most appropriate forum for that? “I don’t think
so,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
