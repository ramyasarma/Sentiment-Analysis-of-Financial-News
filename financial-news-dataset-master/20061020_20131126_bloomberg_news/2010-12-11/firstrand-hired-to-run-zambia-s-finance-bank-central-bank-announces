FirstRand Ltd., South Africa’s
second-largest financial-services group, has been contracted by
the Central Bank of Zambia to run Finance Bank Zambia Ltd.,
central bank spokesman Kanguya Mayondi said today.  “FirstRand of South Africa will manage the day-to-day
affairs of Finance Bank on behalf of the Central Bank of
Zambia,” Mayondi said in a Lusaka phone interview without saying
how much the South African bank will be paid or how long the
contract will last.  Finance Bank, Zambia’s largest privately owned lender, is
currently under central bank supervision. Finance Bank is
partially owned by Credit Suisse Group AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
