Areva SA , the biggest supplier of
nuclear reactors, plans to issue new shares to holders of its
investment certificates as part of a capital increase.  Each holder of 12 investment certificates will be offered
one new preferred share, Areva said in an e-mailed statement
today. The move comes in addition to a plan, approved by the
supervisory board today, to raise 900 million euros ($1.2
billion) by selling stock to the French state and a Kuwaiti
sovereign wealth fund.  Kuwait will buy 600 million euros worth of stock while
France, which currently owns 91 percent of the company, gets an
additional 300 million euros, the company said. The Kuwaiti fund
won’t get a seat on the board. Areva will also proceed with a
10-to-one stock split, according to the release.  “These transactions will enable the group to strengthen
its equity and pursue its development plan with a reinforced
capital structure,” the statement said.  France has been in talks for about a year to sell as much
as 15 percent of the company to Kuwait, Japan’s  Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd.  and the sovereign fund of Qatar. Areva Chief
Executive Officer  Anne Lauvergeon  had aimed to raise 3 billion
euros in the capital increase to help fund spending on
equipment, plants and uranium mines to fend off competition and
sell more reactors and fuel in Europe, China and India.  The company today also said it aims for revenue to reach 12
billion euros by 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
