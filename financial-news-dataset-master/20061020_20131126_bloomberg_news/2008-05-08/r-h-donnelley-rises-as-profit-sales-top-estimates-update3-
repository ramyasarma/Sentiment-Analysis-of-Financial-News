             R.H. Donnelley Corp., publisher of the
Yellow Pages phone directories, jumped 29 percent, matching its
biggest gain since at least 1980, after first-quarter results
exceeded analysts' estimates.  
 The shares have risen 69 percent since May 6, when rival
Yellow Pages publisher Idearc Inc. reported better-than-expected
first-quarter profit.  
 Excluding a $2.5 billion impairment charge, R.H.
Donnelley's earnings of 22 cents a share beat the 17-cent
average of four analysts'  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
net loss of $1.62 billion, or $23.60 a share, compared with a
profit of $16 million, or 22 cents, a year earlier, Cary, North
Carolina-based Donnelley said today in a statement.  
 Sales rose 2 percent to $674.7 million, exceeding the
$672.3 million average of three estimates. Ad  sales  fell 4.8
percent to $717.6 million, assuming the company had owned its
Business.com unit a year earlier. In February, Donnelley said
2008 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, would be as little as $1.35 billion,
down from as much as $1.44 billion forecast in December.  
 ``Ad sales, a leading indicator of revenues, reflected weak
economic conditions in our markets as we expected,'' Chief
Executive Officer David Swanson said in the statement. ``We are
aggressively managing costs in response to this operating
environment.''  
 Refinancing  
 R.H. Donnelley rose $1.82 to $8.20 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares also gained 29
percent on May 6. Both days marked the biggest advances since at
least July 1980. The stock has lost 78 percent this year. Idearc
fell 34 cents to $4.71 after a 46 percent jump two days ago.  
 R.H. Donnelley also announced plans to buy back debt. The
company will repurchase bonds at a discount through an exchange
that will lengthen maturities and include less-restrictive
covenants, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Peter Salkowski said
today in a note. The offer will end on June 6.  
 The company's 8.875 percent  notes  due in January 2016 rose
3.76 cents on the dollar to 70 cents, cutting the yield to 15.7
percent, according to Trace, the bond reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
