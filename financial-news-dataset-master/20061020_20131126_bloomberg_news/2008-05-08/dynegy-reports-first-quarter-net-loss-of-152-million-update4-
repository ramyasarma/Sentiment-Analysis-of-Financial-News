             Dynegy Inc. (DYN) , the owner of power
plants in 12 U.S. states, reported a first-quarter net loss as
the value of contracts used to lock in prices declined.  
 The loss was $152 million, or 18 cents a share, compared
with net income of $14 million, or 3 cents, a year earlier,
Houston-based Dynegy said today in a statement. Revenue jumped
53 percent to $774 million.  
 Dynegy said  market power prices  rose in the first quarter,
causing a loss of $284 million from the energy contracts,
compared with a loss of $23 million a year earlier. Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or
Ebitda, gained 31 percent to $238 million, excluding items such
as the contracts. Profit missed at least one analyst's
estimate.  
 ``I would look at it as a disappointment,'' said Gordon Howald, an analyst at Calyon Securities USA Inc. in New York
who has a neutral rating on Dynegy shares and doesn't own any.  
 Howald said the company's first-quarter profit was about 3
cents a share, when items such as the contracts are excluded.
He was expecting 5 cents. Independent power producers such as
Dynegy are focused on warmer months, he said.  
 Spot prices in the PJM Interconnection LLC power market,
the largest in the U.S., averaged $78.60 per megawatt-hour in
the first quarter, up 19 percent from a year earlier.  
 Dynegy gained about 8,000 megawatts of generation with the
acquisition of plants from closely held LS Power Group in April
2007. Dynegy now has the capacity to produce almost 19,000
megawatts of electricity. That's enough for more than 15
million average homes, based on an Energy Department estimate.  
 Forecast Midpoint  
 Dynegy fell 1 cent to $9.02 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The stock, which has 9 buy recommendations
from analysts and 3 holds, had risen 26 percent this year
before today.  
 The company said its 2008 Ebitda excluding items such as
contracts is forecast to be $1.04 billion. Dynegy now is using
a midpoint for its forecast, as opposed to a range,  David Byford , a company spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview. Dynegy previously said Ebitda this year would be $1
billion to $1.1 billion.
