             London's  Westminster Council 
threatened to slap penalties on  Associated Newspapers Ltd. (DMGT)  and
 News Corp. (NWSA) , saying the publishers' free newspapers are creating
``a mountain'' of garbage in the  West End .  
 Associated's London Lite newspaper and rival News Corp.'s
theLondonpaper, both introduced last year, are handed out by
vendors across the city each weekday afternoon. Westminster
officials said the council has been collecting 20 tons of
discarded newspapers each week since the papers were started.  
 ``We simply cannot afford to let the problem of waste
newspapers defacing our streets continue,'' Alan Bradley, a
Westminster councilor, said in an e-mailed statement. The roads
are ``strewn with a mountain of discarded papers,'' he said.  
 Westminster is the local government authority covering the
West End shopping and entertainment area and the Whitehall
government district. The council voted last night to place limits
on the newspapers' distribution if the publishers fail to agree
to a voluntary cleanup plan in the next month.  
 Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. and Associated, owned by Daily
Mail & General Trust Plc, sparked the biggest newspaper war in
the U.K. capital since the 1980s when they introduced the free
newspapers to stem a decline in circulation of paid-for papers.  
 Associated publishes Britain's Daily Mail and London's
Evening Standard. News Corp.'s titles include The Sun tabloid and
Times of London, and the company is bidding to acquire the Wall
Street Journal.  
 Recycle  
 Ian Clark, general manager of theLondonpaper, said the
company wants to work with Westminster and other London councils
to encourage readers to recycle papers rather than dump them in
garbage cans or on the street.  
 ``I'm pretty positive we will be able to find a solution,''
Clark said in a telephone interview.  
 An Associated spokeswoman said she had no immediate comment.  
 Average daily distribution of theLondonpaper was 486,615 in
May, the  Audit Bureau of Circulations  said on June 8, while
London Lite distributed 400,229 copies.  
 Westminster said it costs 111,000 pounds ($224,000) a year
for the council to dispose of the newspaper waste and that
several months of negotiations with the publishers failed to
produce an agreement. The council has proposed that the papers
pay for 150 recycling boxes and a truck to empty them.  
 If the companies don't reach a deal within 30 days,
Westminster will introduce a measure requiring the newspapers'
vendors to have a permit. In certain areas, the council could
reduce distribution by 30 percent, the council said.  
 The rules wouldn't affect the distribution of political,
religious or charity pamphlets, and the restrictions are allowed
by the U.K.'s 2005 Clean Neighborhoods and Environment Act, the
council said.
