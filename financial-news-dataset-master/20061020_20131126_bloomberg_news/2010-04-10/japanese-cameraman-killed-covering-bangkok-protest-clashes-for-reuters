             Japanese photojournalist Hiro
Muramoto was shot to death in Bangkok while covering fighting
between troops and protesters for the Thomson Reuters news
service.  
 Muramoto, a 15-year veteran with the news service, was in
the Rajdumnoen Road area of Bangkok when he was shot, Olivier
Fabre, senior producer at Reuters Television in Tokyo, said in a
statement today.  
 “Reuters is in contact with Thai authorities to determine
exactly what happened,” Fabre said in the statement. “The
circumstances of Muramoto-san’s death are still under review.”  
 Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said 17 people were
killed in clashes between antigovernment protesters and security
forces seeking to end a month-long occupation of areas of the
capital. Soldiers used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse
demonstrators, many loyal to former Premier Thaksin Shinawatra,
and protesters fought back with guns and bombs, army spokesman
Sansern Kaewkamnerd said.
