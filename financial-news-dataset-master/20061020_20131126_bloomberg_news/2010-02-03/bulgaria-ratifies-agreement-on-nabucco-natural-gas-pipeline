             Bulgaria’s Parliament ratified the
Nabucco pipeline agreement signed by five countries in 2009
that’s aimed at broadening the supply of natural gas to Europe.  
 The 7.9 billion-euro ($11 billion) link “is an European
Union priority,” Energy Minister Traicho Traikov told lawmakers
in Sofia today. The pipe will send 31 billion cubic meters of
fuel a year with operations starting in 2015 and full capacity
will be reached in 2020, he said.  
 The planned 3,000-kilometer (1,800-mile) pipeline aims to
diversify gas supplies by bringing Caspian and Middle East fuel
to  Austria  through  Turkey . The venture, led by Vienna-based  OMV
AG (OMV) , is vying with Asian and Russian projects for access to
Azeri, Turkmen, Iranian and Iraqi gas.  
 Bulgaria, Turkey,  Romania ,  Hungary  and Austria signed the
accord in July 2009 in Ankara. Hungary ratified the agreement
in October.
