             Mexican business leaders are growing
increasingly concerned about violence tied to drug cartels,
saying it’s the biggest threat to the economy, a  survey  by
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu showed.  
 The impact of violence is the biggest threat to the economy
according to 57 percent of executives, up from 49 percent in
March and 22 percent in December 2009, said the June 7-29 poll
of 381 Mexican business leaders released today. The second-most
cited concern was a U.S. economic slowdown.  
 “The U.S. economic situation and political discord in our
country have lost importance in the view of executives as the
main threat for the economic development of Mexico,” Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu said.  
 Almost 25,000 people have been killed in fighting among
gangs, the police and the army since President  Felipe Calderon 
took office in 2006, fueling a debate about whether his strategy
of taking on narcotics traffickers has failed. The government
estimates violence shaves 1 percentage point from gross domestic
product each year.  
 Latin America’s second-biggest economy is recovering from
its worst contraction since 1932, after shrinking 6.5 percent
last year. The central bank forecasts the economy will grow as
much as 5 percent this year.
