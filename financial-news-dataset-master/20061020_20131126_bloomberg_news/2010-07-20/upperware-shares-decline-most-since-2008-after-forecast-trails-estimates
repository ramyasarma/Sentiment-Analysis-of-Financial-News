             Tupperware Brands Corp.  fell the
most in more than a year in New York trading after the direct
seller of plastic storage containers forecast profit that
trailed analysts’ estimates.  
 Third-quarter  earnings  excluding some items will be 54
cents to 59 cents a share, the Orlando, Florida-based company
said yesterday in a statement. The average of nine  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg was 66 cents.  
 The company said its quarterly outlook reflects the effects
of currency exchange rates and a higher income tax rate than a
year earlier. Almost two-thirds of Tupperware’s second-quarter
sales of $565.1 million came from outside North America. The
euro has declined 10 percent against the dollar this year.  
 Tupperware dropped $3.29, or 7.6 percent, to $39.98 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That was
the  shares ’ biggest daily percentage slide since March 5, 2009.
They have declined 14 percent this year.  
 The company reduced its forecast for adjusted full-year
profit, to a range of $3.51 to $3.61 a share. In April,
Tupperware said earnings on that basis would be $3.68 to $3.78.
The average of 11 analysts’ estimates was $3.72.  
 Tupperware yesterday also reported second-quarter profit of
93 cents a share excluding some items. That was less than the
97-cent average estimate of nine analysts.
