             Hong Kong stocks  rose, reversing an
earlier decline, on optimism China will relax its tightening
policies as the economy slows, countering a drop in exporters
after U.S. home-builder confidence fell more than forecast.  
 China Resources Land Ltd., a state-controlled developer,
climbed 2.3 percent.  BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) Ltd.  gained 1.7
percent after the Hong Kong Economic Times said the bank’s unit
in the city will offer yuan insurance policies.  Li & Fung Ltd. ,
the biggest supplier to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
dropped 0.6 percent.  
 The  Hang Seng Index  advanced 0.4 percent to 20,179.79 as of
10:21 a.m. local time, after declining as much as 0.1 percent.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares of
Chinese companies gained 1 percent to 11,425.16.  
 China will “back away” from its tightening policies in
the housing market within three months as the economy faces a
bigger risk from a slowdown than inflation, according to
International Strategy & Investment Group.  
 “We expect Beijing to quietly relax their lending
restrictions and to launch a variety of supply-side initiatives
to increase the amount of housing for low-and middle-income
homebuyers,”  Donald Straszheim , senior managing director for
China research at ISI, wrote in a note to clients.
