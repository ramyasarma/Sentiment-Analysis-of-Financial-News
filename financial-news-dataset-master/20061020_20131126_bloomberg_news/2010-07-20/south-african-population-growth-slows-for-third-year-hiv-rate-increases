             South Africa’s population growth
rate slowed for a third consecutive year in the 12 months
through June, while the number of people living with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, increased.  
 The population rose 1.06 percent to 49.99 million, after
gaining a revised 1.12 percent the year earlier, Pretoria-based
 Statistics South Africa  said on its website today. An estimated
5.24 million of the population are infected with HIV.  
 South Africa is stepping up efforts to combat HIV in a
country that has more people living with the virus than any
other in the world, according to data from the United Nations.
The government plans to reduce new HIV infections by half and
provide treatment to 80 percent of those who need it by 2011.  
 AIDS will probably kill 281,404 people this year,
accounting for 43 percent of all deaths in the country, and 4.2
percent more than recorded in 2009, the statistics office said.
The number of people living with HIV will increase to 10.5
percent of the population this year from 10.3 percent in 2009.
The HIV prevalence rate among those aged 15 to 49 is estimated
at 17.3 percent, the report said.  
 About 1.6 million people aged 15 or older, and 183,000
children need anti-retroviral drugs, the statistics office
estimated. “The total number of new HIV infections for 2010 is
estimated at 410,000,” it said.
