             Mediaset SpA, the broadcaster owned
by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, said it would
appeal the decision by the European Commission to allow News
Corp.’s Sky Italia unit to enter the digital free-to-air market.  
 The decision to allow Sky Italia to request free-to-air
digital spectrum before 2012 is “absolutely disconcerting,”
Mediaset said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The company said it would appeal the ruling to the European
Court of Justice.
