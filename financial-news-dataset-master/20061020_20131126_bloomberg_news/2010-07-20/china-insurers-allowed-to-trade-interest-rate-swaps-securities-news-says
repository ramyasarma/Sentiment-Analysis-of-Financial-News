             Chinese regulators will allow the
nation’s insurers to conduct interest rate swaps, the Shanghai
Securities News reported today, citing a notice issued by the
China Insurance Regulatory Commission.  
 Regulators had held trials allowing six insurers to conduct
interest rate swaps, the newspaper reported. China will now
allow all insurers to do so to hedge against risk and not for
speculation, the newspaper reported, without giving a timeframe.  
 Insurers will be allowed to conduct interest rate swaps
equal to as much as 10 percent of their assets at the end of the
previous quarter, according to the report.
