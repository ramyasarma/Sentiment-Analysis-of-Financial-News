             U.K. stocks declined, led by a
selloff in phone companies.  
 The FTSE 100 Index dropped 28.90, or 0.6 percent, to
5,119.38 at 11 a.m. in London. The gauge earlier rose as much as
0.6 percent.  
 Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc tumbled 17 percent after the
company warned earnings will be “around the lower end” of
analysts’ forecasts.
