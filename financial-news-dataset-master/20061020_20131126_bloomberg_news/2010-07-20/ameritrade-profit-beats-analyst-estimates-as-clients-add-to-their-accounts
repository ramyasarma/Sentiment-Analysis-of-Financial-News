             TD Ameritrade Holding Corp ., the
third-largest retail brokerage by client assets, reported fiscal
third-quarter profit that beat the average analyst estimate as
customers traded more and added assets to their accounts.  
 Net income rose 5.2 percent to $179.4 million during the
period that ended June 30, compared with $170.5 million a year
earlier, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding some items, Ameritrade earned 30 cents a
shares, beating the 28-cent average forecast from 15  analysts 
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Revenue  from earned interest climbed 13 percent to $111.4
million. That brought total sales to $691.8 million for the
quarter, beating the average estimate of $679.3 million,
according to a Bloomberg survey. The brokerage collected net new
assets from customers of $8.9 billion, 29 percent higher than a
year ago. The brokerage also said it completed a buyback program
for 15 million shares.  
 “When you look at the asset gathering, they continue to
perform very well,” said  Mike Vinciquerra , an Atlanta-based
analyst with BMO Capital Markets. “And while they are building
significant cash on the balance sheet, they are trying to put it
to use. So there are very good trends there.”  
 Shares  of Ameritrade fell 3.7 percent to $15.23 at 4 p.m.
New York time, bringing their 2010 decline to 21 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has retreated 2.8 percent, and the
NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer Index has slumped 11 percent.  
 Trading Climbs  
 Ameritrade clients placed an average of 413,461 trades per
day, compared with 391,506 a year earlier. Daily trading this
month has been slower, with the average at about 328,000,
according to a presentation on the company’s  website . That may
be dragging the shares down today, Vinciquerra said.  
 Ameritrade also said it spent about $244 million to buy
back 15 million shares at an average $17.25 each during the
quarter through July 2, according to today’s statement. The
brokerage had about $1.2 billion in cash and liquid  assets  as of
June 30 -- more than its target range of $500 million to $1
billion.  
 “Fiscal third quarter was a solid earnings beat for TD
Ameritrade,”  Patrick O’Shaughnessy , a Chicago-based analyst
with Raymond James & Associates Inc., wrote in a note after the
release today. “Perhaps more encouraging was the firm’s
completion of a long-awaited share repurchase program, from
which the firm only partially benefitted in the fiscal third
quarter.”  
 ‘Solid’ Beat  
 The brokerage also plans to spend $30 million on a client-
focused and technology development plan next year, Chief
Executive Officer  Fred Tomczyk  said on the conference call.
About half of that may be spent on hiring more sales people, he
added in an interview. Ameritrade also may introduce a  dividend 
once there’s more clarity about U.S. plans for a dividend tax,
Tomczyk said.  
 “Given our business model -- the low-capital intensity of
it, the sustainability of our earnings, our cash-flow generation
-- a dividend will definitely make sense at some point for our
organization,” he said.  
 Ameritrade cut its 2010 earnings forecast to 90 cents to
$1.10 a share on April 20, citing smaller asset-price swings.
Analysts expect $1.04 a share, according to the average in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 Charles Schwab Corp. , the largest independent brokerage by
client assets, gained the most in more than two months after
posting profit that beat estimates on July 16. E*Trade Financial
Corp. is scheduled to post a loss of 11 cents a share on July
22, its 12th straight quarterly loss.
