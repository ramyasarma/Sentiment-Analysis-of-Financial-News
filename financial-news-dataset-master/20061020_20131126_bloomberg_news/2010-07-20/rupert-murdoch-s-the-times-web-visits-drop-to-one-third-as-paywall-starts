             Visits to the website of The Times
newspaper have fallen to a third since  Rupert Murdoch’s   News
Corp.  started asking users to pay for online access.  
 Traffic in the week ended July 10 declined to 33 percent of
that before the company demanded users register, according to
data compiled by Experian Hitwise. The Times’ share of traffic
to news and media websites from the U.K. fell to 1.43 percent
from 4.46 percent, Experian said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The Times and The Sunday Times are the first of four News
International titles in the U.K. to move to an online-pay model.
They are among the first general-interest English-language
newspapers to charge for web access as publishers search for new
ways to earn revenue and curb free sharing of their news on
Internet search engines and aggregator sites. The New York Times
plans to put up an Internet paywall next year.  
 Online access to both The Times and The Sunday Times costs
1 pound ($1.50) a day or 2 pounds a week.  
 Experian Hitwise monitors visits to websites as opposed to
the number of visitors.
