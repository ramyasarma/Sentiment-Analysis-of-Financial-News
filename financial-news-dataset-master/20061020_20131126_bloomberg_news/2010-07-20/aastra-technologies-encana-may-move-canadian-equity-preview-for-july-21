             Canadian stocks  fell as energy
producers declined with an unexpected gain in oil supplies and
financial shares dropped when U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s testimony to Congress heightened concerns the
recovery is faltering.  
 Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada’s third-biggest bank, slipped
2.1 percent after Bernanke said “the economic outlook remains
unusually uncertain.” EnCana, Canada’s largest natural gas
producer, lost 4.6 percent after reporting second-quarter profit
that missed the average analyst estimate. Research In Motion
Ltd. decreased 3.1 percent after smartphone rival Apple Inc.
forecast $18 billion in fourth-quarter sales, 5.9 percent more
than the average analyst estimate.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  retreated 116.55
points, or 1 percent, to 11,513.33. Most of the drop came after
Bernanke’s statement, in which he devoted almost 10 times as
many words to the exit from stimulus as he did to potential
actions to boost growth.  
 “Demand isn’t there, the consumer is retrenching, the
stimulus has ended,” said  Michael Sprung , president of Sprung &
Co. Investment Counsel Inc. in Toronto. “What is going to keep
the momentum going forward? So what his comments have done is
feed some doubts into the robustness of the economy.”  
 After climbing 4.6 percent this year through its 2010 high
on April 26, the S&P/TSX has fallen  6.3 percent  since then. The
benchmark dropped on concern over the possibility of sovereign
debt default in Europe and unease about the sustainability of
the economic recovery in the U.S.  
 Wholesale Sales  
 S&P/TSX financial companies may also have suffered from an
unexpected decline in  wholesale sales  in Canada. Sales slipped
0.1 in May, Statistics Canada said today. All 15 economists in a
Bloomberg survey had forecast an increase.  
 Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s  largest bank , fell for
a fourth day, losing 2.9 percent to C$52. Scotiabank dropped 2.1
percent to C$50.01. Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s
third-biggest insurer, lost 2.3 percent to C$14.63.  
 EnCana’s  per-share earnings  trailed the average analyst
estimate by 51 percent, excluding certain items. Adjusted net
income was the lowest since at least 1999. Including one-time
non-operational charges, the Calgary-based company had a $505
million loss. EnCana sank 4.6 percent, the most in a year, to
C$32.90.  
 Other energy companies dropped after the U.S. Energy
Department said crude oil  inventories  increased by 360,000
barrels last week. Most economists in a Bloomberg survey had
forecast a decrease. Oil futures slipped 1.3 percent.  
 Suncor Falls  
 Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil and gas company,
declined 1.8 percent to C$32.54. Canadian Natural Resources
Ltd., the country’s second-biggest energy company by market
value, decreased 1.6 percent to C$35.92. Talisman Energy Inc.,
which produces oil and gas in North America, the North Sea and
Indonesia, retreated 1.4 percent to C$16.61.  
 RIM, Canada’s largest technology company, slid 3.1 percent
to C$55.94 after Apple’s fourth-quarter earnings beat the
average analyst estimate by 11 percent, excluding certain items.
RIM’s share of the global smartphone market in the first quarter
shrank to 19.4 percent from 20.9 percent last year, while
Apple’s increased to 16.1 percent from 10.9 percent, market-
research firm IDC said in May.  
 Red Back Mining Inc., which produces gold in Africa,
slumped 3.3 percent to C$24.46 after reducing its 2010
production forecast. The company has suffered from water pipe
failures at its mine in Mauritania.  
 Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., the owner of Circle K and
Mac’s convenience stores, surged 4.2 percent to a seven-month
high of C$21.31. Toronto-Dominion Bank analyst  Michael Val Aelst 
raised his rating on the company to “action list buy” from
“buy,” saying in a note that his previous estimates for
expenses and depreciation were too high.
