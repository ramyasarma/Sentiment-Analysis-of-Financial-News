             Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB  rose after
Mexico’s largest retailer said profit surged in the second
quarter because of the acquisition of a Central American unit of
its parent company.  
 Its shares rose 1.1 percent to 30.06 pesos in Mexico City
trading at 4 p.m. New York time.  
 Earnings rose 24 percent to 4.65 billion pesos ($363.8
million), up from 3.75 billion pesos a year earlier. Sales
increased 27 percent after the Mexico City-based company bought
519 stories in Central America in February from Wal-Mart Stores
Inc.  
 Wal-Mart de Mexico “reported slightly better operating
results, driven by impressive gross margin numbers,”  Gustavo Piras Oliveira , an analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a note to clients
today. He has a neutral rating on Wal-Mart de Mexico and a
target price of 32.5 pesos.
