             Mark Wilson , who was replaced as
leader of  American International Group Inc. ’s main Asia unit,
joins more than 70 managers who defected to competitors,
retired or were forced out following the insurer’s rescue.  
 Former Prudential Plc Chief Executive Officer  Mark Tucker 
will be the new head of AIA Group Ltd, AIG said yesterday. AIG
CEO  Robert Benmosche  told staff in a memo that AIA needs to
put “the best team of the field” to prepare for the unit’s
initial public offering.  Harvey Golub  stepped down last week as
AIG’s chairman after clashing with Benmosche over AIA.  
 The following table lists managers who have left since
New York-based AIG was rescued by the U.S. in a 2008 bailout
that swelled to $182.3 billion. The table was compiled from
company statements and news reports. Some job titles, companies
and employee first names have been abbreviated for space, and
the new employers of some people weren’t immediately available.
