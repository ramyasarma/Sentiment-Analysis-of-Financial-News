             Sara Lee Corp. , the maker of Jimmy
Dean foods, is exploring the sale of its North American bread
and bakery unit, said people familiar with the matter, a move
that would accelerate a broader overhaul of the company.  
 The business, which includes the largest fresh-bread brand
in the U.S., may fetch about $1.5 billion, according to one of
the people, who declined to be identified because the process
isn’t public. Sara Lee hired Bank of America Corp. to advise it
on options for the division, these people said.  
 A sale would extend the multiyear reorganization of Downers
Grove, Illinois-based Sara Lee, which spun off the  Hanesbrands
Inc.  underwear unit in 2006 and last year agreed to divest air
freshener and body-care divisions. The company has better growth
prospects for its meat and beverage units, according to  Erin Swanson , an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.  
 “Sara Lee has struggled to turn around the North American
fresh bakery business, and the segment’s operating margins
continue to lag those of others in the space despite its
national presence,” Swanson said. She recommends holding the
shares. “The segment has been an Achilles’ heel for Sara Lee.”  
 A formal sale process hasn’t started yet and books for the
business aren’t out, according to the people. Advisers recently
began canvassing private-equity funds to gauge their interest in
the business as demand from strategic buyers such as Mexico’s
Grupo Bimbo SAB may be limited, the people said.  
 Mike Cummins , a Sara Lee spokesman, declined to comment.  
 Earthgrains Purchase  
 Sara Lee rose 18 cents to $14.68 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has gained 21
percent this year.  
 The company spent $2.8 billion in  cash  and debt in 2001 to
buy breadmaker Earthgrains Co., more than quadrupling annual
bakery sales at the time.  
 The unit has faced competition from cheaper store brands
and regional bakeries such as  Flowers Foods Inc.  Operating
profit from the division dropped to $33 million in fiscal 2009,
while sales totaled $2.2 billion.  
 The possibility of a sale was reported by Crain’s Chicago
Business earlier this week.  
 Brenda Barnes , who took a medical leave of absence as chief
executive officer in May to recover from a stroke, has tried to
grow the U.S. bread business with products such as white bread
made with whole grains, and marketing campaigns tied to movies
such as “Toy Story 3” and “High School Musical.” She has
also made  acquisitions , like the $72 million purchase of Butter
Krust Baking Co. in 2006.  
 At the same time, Sara Lee has been weighing a separation
of the North American bakery unit, said a person with knowledge
of management’s thinking. An earlier effort to sell the business
to Grupo Bimbo failed when the Mexican company agreed instead in
2008 to buy a baked-goods business from Toronto-based George
Weston Ltd. for $2.5 billion, the person said.  
 Marcel Smits , Sara Lee’s chief financial officer who is now
interim CEO, told investors in February that “the bakery
business is not the main driver of our profit and Ebitda
improvements as we go forward.”
