             Khazanah Nasional Bhd., Malaysia’s 
sovereign wealth fund, may raise its offer to more than S$4 a 
share for Parkway Holdings Ltd. to fend off rival bidder Fortis
Healthcare Ltd., Reuters said, citing unidentified people 
familiar with the deal.  
 Khazanah is considering whether to increase its S$3.78 a 
share partial offer or go with a general offer to top the 
S$3.80 bid by Fortis, the report said.
