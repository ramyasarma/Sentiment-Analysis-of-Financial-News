             HIV infections in Britons older than
50 more than doubled over seven years, the U.K.  Health
Protection Agency  said in a report today.  
 Cases among older people rose to 710 new cases in 2007 from
299 new cases in 2000, according to researchers at the agency’s
Centre for Infections who reviewed reports from England, Wales
and Northern Ireland.  
 Half of those over 50 were diagnosed with HIV late,
compared with a third or younger people, the agency said. About
75 percent of deaths among older HIV patients occurred within a
year of diagnosis, the researchers said. The findings were
published online in the journal AIDS and presented at the
International AIDS Conference in Vienna.
