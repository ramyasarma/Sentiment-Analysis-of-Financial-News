             Power Finance Corp. , the state-owned
Indian lender to power projects, hired 20 banks to help it sell
five- and 10-year bonds in rupees, according to two people
familiar with the matter.  
 The New Delhi-based company plans to raise at least 10
billion rupees ($212 million) from the sales, said the people,
who asked not to be identified as they’re not authorized to
discuss the issue.  
 Power Finance’s five-year notes will pay an 8.25 percent
coupon and the 10-year securities will pay 8.7 percent, the
people said.
