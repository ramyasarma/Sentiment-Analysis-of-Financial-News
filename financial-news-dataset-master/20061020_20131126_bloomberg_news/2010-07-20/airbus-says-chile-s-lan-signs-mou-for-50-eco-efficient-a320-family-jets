                          July 19 (Bloomberg) -- Tom Enders, chief executive officer of Airbus SAS, talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about the outlook for aircraft orders this year and production of the company's A380 and A320 jets.
     Airbus and Boeing Co. announced 189 orders on the first day of the Farnborough Air Show, more than double the total on day one of last year’s Paris event, as leasing companies returned to the market after the recession. Enders speaks on Bloomberg Television's "InBusiness With Margaret Brennan." (Source: Bloomberg)
