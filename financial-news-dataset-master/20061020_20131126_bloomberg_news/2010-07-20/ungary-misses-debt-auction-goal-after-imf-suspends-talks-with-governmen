             The Hungarian government raised 35
billion forint ($156 million), 10 billion forint less than
planned, at a sale of three-month Treasury bills today as debt
costs rose from the previous auction a week earlier.  
 The average yield on the auctioned maturity rose to 5.47
percent from 5.28 percent on July 13, according to auction
results on the debt management agency’s Bloomberg page.
Investors submitted bids worth 52.5 billion forint compared with
total bids of 102.5 billion a week earlier, the results showed.
