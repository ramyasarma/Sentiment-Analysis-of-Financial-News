             Nippon Steel Corp. and JFE Steel
Corp. will reduce crude steel output in Japan in the current
quarter as exports to China slow, Nikkei English News said,
without saying where it got the information.   
 Nippon Steel plans to cut crude steel output by about 5
percent to about 8 million tons from an 8.4 million-ton target,
Nikkei said. JFE may pare July-September output by 300,000 tons
to 500,000 tons from its 7.5 million-ton target, Nikkei
reported. China has represented almost half of global steel
demand, Nikkei said.
