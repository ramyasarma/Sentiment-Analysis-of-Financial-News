             Bayer CropScience Ltd.’s shares
surged in Mumbai after the maker of agrochemicals said it plans
to sell about 100 acres of land.  
 The shares gained as much as 9.4 percent to 885 rupees, the
highest price since at least January 1991, and traded at 860
rupees at 9:11 a.m. local time.  
 The company’s board approved the land-sale proposal, Bayer
said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange yesterday.
