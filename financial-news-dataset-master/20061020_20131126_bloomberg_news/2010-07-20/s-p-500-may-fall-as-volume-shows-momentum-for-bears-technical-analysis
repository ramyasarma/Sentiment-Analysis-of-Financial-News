             Falling  stocks generated more
trading than rising shares, a sign that the U.S. market may
extend its biggest decline since the bull market began,
according to Bank of America Corp.’s  Mary Ann Bartels .  
 Since April, stocks have had nine “90 percent down days,”
when nine declined for each that gained and 90 percent of
trading came from falling shares, Bartels said. During these
days, New York Stock Exchange composite  trading  averaged 6.8
billion shares, higher than the average volume of 5.5 billion
from the seven “90 percent up days,” she said. The latest “90
percent down day,” on July 16, came after the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index  approached the 1,100 level three times without
exceeding it last week.  
 “Higher average volume for 90 percent down days supports
the bearish case,” Bartels, ranked second among analysts who
study price charts in Institutional Investor magazine’s most
recent survey, wrote in a note to clients yesterday. “In July,
the 1,100 area is a nearby resistance that has the potential to
trigger a pullback.”  
 The S&P 500 has dropped 12 percent from its 2010 high on
April 23 on concern a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe is
spreading and economic growth in China and the U.S. is slowing.
The April peak was 80 percent above the 12-year low in March
2009.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
