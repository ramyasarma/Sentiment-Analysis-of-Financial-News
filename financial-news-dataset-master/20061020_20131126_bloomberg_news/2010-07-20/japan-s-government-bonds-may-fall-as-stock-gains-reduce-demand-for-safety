             Japanese 20-year  bonds  fell for a
third day before the Ministry of Finance auctions 1.1 trillion
yen ($12.6 billion) of the securities tomorrow.  
 Primary dealers, which are required to bid at government
debt sales, often reduce holdings of bonds ahead of auctions in
case prices decline before they can pass on the new securities.
Futures on 10-year bonds rose as the stronger yen clouded the
outlook for corporate earnings and drove down Japanese shares.  
 “The coupon at tomorrow’s auction of 20-year bonds is
likely to be lowered to 1.8 percent, the lowest since 2004,”
said  Akitsugu Bandou , senior economist at Tokyo-based Okasan
Securities Co. “I have doubts as to whether bonds with coupons
this low will sell well.”  
 The  yield  on the benchmark 20-year bond rose half a basis
point to 1.800 percent as of 1:19 p.m. at Japan Bond Trading
Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 2 percent
security due June 2030 fell 0.076 yen to 102.930 yen.  
 The yield on the 10-year bond was unchanged at 1.090
percent. Ten-year bond futures for September delivery rose 0.04
to 141.65 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average  erased an early gain, falling
as much as 0.8 percent as the yen strengthened against the
dollar. The yen appreciated to as much as 87.07 per dollar from
87.41 at the 9 a.m. opening of stock trading.  
 Japan’s bonds often move in the opposite direction to
stocks. Benchmark 10-year yields had a  correlation  of 0.53 with
the Nikkei 225 in the past three months, according to Bloomberg
data. A value of 1 means the two moved in lockstep.  
 Lending Demand  
 The previous auction of 20-year securities on June 16 drew
bids for 4.6 times the amount on offer, compared with a so-
called  bid -to-cover ratio of 3.93 in May.  
 Demand for debt was supported on prospects weak corporate
borrowing will compel banks to put more money into bonds. An
index of demand for loans to businesses slid to minus 17 in July
from minus 10 three months ago, the Bank of Japan  said  today.
The number has been negative for five-straight quarters.  
 “Given weak corporate demand for new loans, underlying
demand for government bonds from Japanese banks remains
strong,” said  RuiXue Xu  , a Tokyo-based strategist at RBS
Securities Japan Ltd., a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc.
