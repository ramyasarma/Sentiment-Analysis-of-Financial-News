             Juniper Networks Inc. , the second-
biggest maker of networking equipment, reported profit that
topped analysts’ estimates, boosted by spending from companies
upgrading hardware to run their networks.  
 Second-quarter  net income  rose to $130.5 million, or
24 cents a share, from $14.8 million, or 3 cents, a year
earlier, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding some costs, earnings were 30 cents.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated 29 cents on average.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Kevin Johnson  is reviving growth at
Juniper after sales fell last year for the first time since
2002. After putting off upgrades during the recession, more
customers are improving their information-technology systems to
handle surging Internet traffic.  
 “We expect network security IT spending to continue over
the next two years,”  Catherine Trebnick , an analyst at Avian
Securities LLC, said in a note to investors. She has a neutral
rating on the shares.  
 Third-quarter sales will increase to between $982 million
and $1.02 billion, Juniper said. Profit will climb to 30 cents
to 32 cents a share.  Analysts  had projected revenue of $993.1
million and earnings of 31 cents.  
 Sales increased 24 percent to $978.3 million last quarter.  
 Juniper dropped 70 cents to $26.69 in late trading. The
stock had risen 9 cents to $26.69 earlier today on the New York
Stock Exchange. The shares are little changed this year.
