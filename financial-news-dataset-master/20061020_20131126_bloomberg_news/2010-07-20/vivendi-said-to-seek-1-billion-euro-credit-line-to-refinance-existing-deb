             Vivendi SA , the world’s largest
video-games supplier and music company, asked banks for a 1
billion-euro ($1.3 billion) credit line to refinance existing
debt, according to two people involved in the discussions.  
 Vivendi  approached banks directly and offered to pay
lenders interest of 55 basis points more than benchmark rates on
money it draws from the revolving credit facility, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the transaction is
private. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Agnes Vetillart , a spokeswoman for Paris-based Vivendi,
declined to comment.  
 Vivendi has a 1 billion-euro loan maturing next year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company agreed to
pay initial interest of 40 basis points more than the euro
interbank offered rate on that deal, Bloomberg data show.  
 The company is  ranked  Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service,
two levels above junk status, and an equivalent BBB by Standard
& Poor’s and Fitch Ratings.
