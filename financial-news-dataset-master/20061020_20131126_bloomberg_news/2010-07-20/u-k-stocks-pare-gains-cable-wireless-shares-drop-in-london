             U.K. stocks pared gains, led by
selloff in Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc.  
 The FTSE 100 Index was little changed at 5149.29 at 8:33
a.m. in London. The gauge earlier climbed as much as 0.6
percent.  
 Cable & Wireless sank 12 percent to 73.6 pence after the
company said it expects full-year earnings growth to slow.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. also downgraded the shares to
“underweight.”
