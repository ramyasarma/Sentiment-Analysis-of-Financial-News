             The People’s Bank of China sold one-
year bills at a yield of 2.0929 percent, unchanged for the sixth
week, according to traders at Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. and China Citic Bank Corp.  
 The monetary authority offered 45 billion yuan ($6.6
billion) of the securities at the auction today.  
 The central bank allowed the yield to rise twice in June to
attract bids from banks.
