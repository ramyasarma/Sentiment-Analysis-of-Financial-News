             The French state backs GDF Suez SA’s
plan to gain control of International Power Plc, Les Echos
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The state, which is GDF Suez’s largest shareholder, has
pointed out that the transaction might have an impact on GDF’s
debt rating, the newspaper said. GDF may sell assets in the
medium term, Les Echos added.  
 International Power shareholders will get a special
dividend if an accord is reached, according to the newspaper. No
amount was specified.
