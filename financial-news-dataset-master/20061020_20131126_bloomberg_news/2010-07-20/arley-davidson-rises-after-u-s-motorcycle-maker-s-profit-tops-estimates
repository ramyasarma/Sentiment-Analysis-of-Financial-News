             Harley-Davidson Inc. , the biggest
U.S. motorcycle maker, rose the most in more than a year after a
profit in the company’s consumer loan unit helped earnings top
analysts’  estimates .  
 Harley jumped $3.22, or 14 percent, to $26.83 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the biggest gain
since April 2, 2009. The shares have risen 6.5 percent this
year.  
 Profit  from continuing operations rose more than fourfold
to $139.3 million, or 59 cents a share, from $33.4 million, or
14 cents, a year earlier, Milwaukee-based Harley said today in a
statement. Profit was expected to be 41 cents a share, the
average  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
fell less than 1 percent to $1.14 billion.  
 “The key is now that the financial services segment has
appeared to stage a pretty abrupt turnaround, they have to
eventually demonstrate growth selling motorcycles,” Brent
Miller, an analyst with Gradient Analytics in Scottsdale,
Arizona, said in an interview.  
 The  credit  unit had operating income of $60.8 million,
compared with a $90.5 million loss a year earlier, and the
decline in retail sales slowed for the fourth straight quarter.  
 Labor Negotiations  
 Harley said it expects to start negotiations this week on
labor deals expiring in 2012 that cover workers in the Milwaukee
area and Tomahawk, Wisconsin. Harley said it needs to reduce
costs and increase flexibility for seasonal production changes.  
 Starting contract negotiations almost two years before the
current agreement is set to expire is “very atypical,” Chief
Executive Officer  Keith Wandell  said in an interview. The
company wants some production workers at those plants to become
part-time employees who work based on demand, he said.  
 Harley restructured operations at its plant in York,
Pennsylvania, in December. The plan cut the union workforce from
1,950 to about 1,000, of which 700 to 800 remain as full-time
employees.  
 “We’re transforming the entire company to be more flexible
and closer to customer demand,” Wandell said. “If we can’t get
there by mid-September, the timing is such that we’re going to
have to a build a new plant somewhere and get the thing up and
running so we’re still online to meet our objective.”
