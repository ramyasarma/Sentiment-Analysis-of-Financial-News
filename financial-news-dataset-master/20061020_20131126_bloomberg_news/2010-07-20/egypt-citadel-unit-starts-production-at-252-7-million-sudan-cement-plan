             Citadel Capital , an Egyptian private
equity firm with $8.3 billion in investments, said its Asec
Cement unit started production at the Al-Takamul plant in Sudan.  
 The $252.7 million plant has an output capacity of 1.5
million tons of clinker and 1.6 million tons of cement a year,
the Cairo-based company said in a regulatory filing today. Asec
will build a 42 megawatt power plant to supply the facility.  
 The facility will halve the 3 million-ton cement shortage
in Sudan, Citadel said in the statement. The company expects to
control companies producing 12 million tons of cement in five
territories in the Middle East including Algeria and Iraq’s
Kurdish region by 2013, it said.  
 Asec owns 51 percent of the new cement plant. Citadel owns
30 percent of Asec Cement, according to the regulatory filing.
