             Hogs fell for the first time in
three sessions and cattle retreated from a two-month high on
speculation that a slowing U.S. economy will reduce meat
consumption.  
 U.S.  housing starts  fell in June to the lowest level since
October following the expiration of a federal tax incentive.
Payrolls decreased in 27 states in June, led by California and
New York, signaling a broad retrenchment in job creation, data
from the Labor Department showed. Before today, hogs rose 16
percent this year while cattle gained 9.5 percent.  
 “The worries about the economy are weighing on consumer
buying patterns,” said  Dale Durchholz , the senior market
analyst for AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington, Illinois. “You simply
have too many people out of work right now, and that’s a drag on
meat demand.”  
 Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.9 cent, or 1.2
percent, to 74.875 cents a pound at 10:31 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, after rising 0.6 percent the prior two
sessions.  
 Cattle futures for October delivery were little changed at
94.375 cents a pound in Chicago, after a five-session rally.
Earlier, the price touched 94.6 cents, the highest level for a
most-active contract since May 14.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement were also
steady at $1.145 a pound.
