             Angola owes suppliers about $9
billion and has paid $1 billion of its debt to them, the
southwest African nation’s Finance Ministry said.  
 The total debt includes money owed to building companies,
the ministry said in a statement published in Luanda-based
Jornal de Angola today. Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos yesterday said the country owes $6.8 billion to
construction companies.  
 “The idea is to settle this late payment completely,” the
statement said.
