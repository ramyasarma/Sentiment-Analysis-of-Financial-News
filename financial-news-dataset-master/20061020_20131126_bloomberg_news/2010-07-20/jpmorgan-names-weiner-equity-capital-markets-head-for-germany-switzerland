             JPMorgan Chase & Co.  appointed
 Stefan Weiner , former head of equity syndication for Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, as head of equity capital markets for
Germany, Austria and Switzerland, said two people with knowledge
of the matter.  
 Weiner was replaced by  Greg Chamberlain , who previously
oversaw the firm’s U.K. equity syndicate business, according to
the people, who declined to be named because the information
isn’t yet public. Weiner previously ran equity syndication in
Asia and was part of the European origination team.  
 New York-based JPMorgan is this year’s biggest underwriter
of initial public offerings in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, helping companies such as Jupiter Fund Management Plc to
raise $3.4 billion in total, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. JPMorgan helped four German companies including
Brenntag AG and Kabel Deutschland Holding AG to raise money from
initial share sales this year.  
 A JPMorgan spokesman in London declined to comment.
