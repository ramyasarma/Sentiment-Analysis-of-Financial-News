             Taiwan’s  export orders  rose faster
than economists expected in June as slower Chinese economic
growth and Europe’s debt crisis failed to dampen overseas demand.  
 Orders, an indication of shipments in the next one to three
months, increased 22.48 percent from a year earlier, after a
34.03 percent gain in May, the  Ministry of Economic Affairs  said
in Taipei today. The median estimate of 15 economists in a
Bloomberg News  survey  was for a 21.7 percent gain.  
 A steady global recovery has been spurring exports and
domestic consumption, the government-backed Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research said last week, raising its
2010 economic growth forecast to 6.94 percent from an April
estimate of 4.99 percent.  
 “External demand for Taiwan’s electronic products is
growing as stores build inventory for August and September when
schools reopen,”  Hsu Kuo-an , an economist at Capital Securities
Corp. in Taipei, said before the report. “The economic recovery
will continue to help support growth.”  
 Chinese demand for Taiwanese products such as computer
chips and televisions helped to stoke a 13.3% expansion in the
island’s economy in the first quarter, the fastest pace in more
than three decades.  
 Rate surprise  
 Taiwan’s central bank raised borrowing costs unexpectedly
on June 24 for the first time since 2008, increasing the
discount rate on 10-day loans to 1.375 percent from a record-low
1.25 percent. It said the move reflected the island’s economic
recovery, including export gains.  
 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. , the world’s largest
custom manufacturer of chips, will spend NT$300 billion ($9.3
billion) on building a new factory in Taichung, central Taiwan,
signaling it expects increasing global demand for the components
used in phones and computers.  
 The firm, the island’s biggest company by market value,
plans to hire as many as 8,000 workers for the factory, its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Morris Chang  said last week.  
 Today’s export orders data were released after the close of
trading on the stock exchange. The Taiex index rose 0.8 percent
to 7,712.03. The Taiwan dollar was NT$32.155 against its U.S.
counterpart as of 4 p.m., according to Taipei Forex Inc.  
 The value of export orders climbed to $34.22 billion last
month from $33.73 billion in May, today’s report showed.  
 Orders for electronics rose 26.91 percent last month, after
a 32.75 percent increase in May, today’s report showed. Demand
for precision goods rose 25.21 percent.  
 Export outlook  
 Recent data have indicated a weaker U.S. economic recovery
and a slowdown in Chinese growth as Europe’s financial troubles
continue, clouding the outlook for Asian exports.  
 The U.S. economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than an earlier estimate of 3 percent,
according to Commerce Department figures published last month.  
 Europe is stress testing its 91 largest banks this month to
restore confidence following the region’s sovereign debt crisis.  
 China’s economic expansion eased to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter from 11.9 percent in January-March, the country’s
statistics bureau said last week, after the government moved to
temper growth.  
 Taiwan signed its first trade accord with China in June,
strengthening commercial ties with the world’s fastest-growing
major economy and the island’s biggest trading partner and
investment destination.  
 Export orders to China and Hong Kong combined rose 15.54
percent last month from a year earlier, after a 34.34 percent
gain in May, today’s data showed. Orders from the U.S. climbed
17.44 percent from a year earlier, after a 20.32 percent rise in
May.
