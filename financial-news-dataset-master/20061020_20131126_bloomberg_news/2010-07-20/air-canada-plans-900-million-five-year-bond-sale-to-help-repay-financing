             Air Canada , the country’s largest
airline, plans to sell through a private offering $900 million
of five-year notes denominated in U.S. and Canadian currency.  
 Proceeds will be used to repay a term loan and for general
corporate purposes, Montreal-based Air Canada said today in a
statement distributed by CNW Telbec.  
 The senior secured notes may be sold next week, according
to a person familiar with the transaction.  
 JPMorgan Chase & Co., Toronto-Dominion Bank, Morgan Stanley
and Citigroup Inc. are managing the sale, said the person, who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.  
 Moody’s Investors Service assigned the notes a rank of B2,
five levels below investment grade, and Standard & Poor’s graded
them B+, one step higher, according to separate reports. S&P
said it was considering whether to upgrade Air Canada’s CCC+
corporate credit rating.  
 Company spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick declined to comment.  
 Air Canada has C$700 million ($667 million) of debt
maturing in 2014 under the term loan entered last July,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
