             Sugar stockpile in India, the
second-biggest producer, may surge 84 percent because of an
increase in production and imports, a producers’ group said.  
 Reserves may be 5.9 million metric tons on Sept. 30, up
from 3.2 million tons a year earlier, the Indian Sugar Mills
Association said. Output in the 2009-10 season may total 18.8
million tons, the group said, repeating a previous estimate.  
 A bigger stockpile and a 33 percent jump in output to 25
million tons forecast by the association for the year starting
Oct. 1 will help the world’s biggest consumer pare imports, said
 Amol Tilak , an analyst at Kotak Commodity Services Ltd.  
 “We may not need to import a single grain as supplies will
be enough,” he said. “If we import there will be a glut.”  
 India has allowed duty-free imports of white and raw sugar
until Dec. 31 as prices doubled last year. Supplies from imports
may be 5.3 million tons this season, the association said.  
 The government will decide on imposing duty on imports in
August or September to encourage purchases of domestic supplies,
Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  said July 5.
