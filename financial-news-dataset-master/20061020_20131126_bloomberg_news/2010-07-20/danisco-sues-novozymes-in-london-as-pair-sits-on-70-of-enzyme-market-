             Danisco A/S  filed a U.K. patent-
infringement lawsuit against  Novozymes A/S  over an enzyme in the
latest legal battle between the companies.  
 The case was filed at the U.K. High Court yesterday,
according to court records.  Michael von Buelow , a spokesman for
Danisco, wouldn’t say which enzymes were covered by the patent
in the lawsuit.  
 “This is becoming the new normal for our relationship with
Novozymes,” Buelow said. “We sit on 70 percent of the global
enzyme market between us, so there’s bound to be some
confrontation.”  
 Novozymes, based in Bagsvaerd, Denmark, in May filed a
complaint in the U.S. that said Danisco infringed its patent on
a so-called alpha amylase enzyme used in biofuels. In 2007,
Danisco paid Novozymes $15.3 million to settle a patent dispute
over another enzyme, also used in ethanol production.  
 The legal department at Novozymes hasn’t received any
information on the suit, Annegrethe Jakobsen, a spokeswoman,
said by phone.  
 Both companies produce enzymes that break down organic
material, such as grain and corn, to form bioethanol, which is
used as an alternative to fossil fuels.  
 Danisco and Novozymes are also developing so-called second-
generation bioethanol, which uses organic waste such as corn-
cobs, rather than grain and other food stuffs. Danisco estimates
the global market for such second-generation biofuel will grow
to $75 billion by 2020.  
 The case is: Danisco A/S v. Novozymes A/S, HC10C02358, High
Court of Justice, Chancery Division.
