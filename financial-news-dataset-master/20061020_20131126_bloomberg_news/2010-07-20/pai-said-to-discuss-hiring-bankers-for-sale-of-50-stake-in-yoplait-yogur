             PAI Partners, a French private
equity firm, plans to hire investment banks to help sell its 50
percent stake in Yoplait yogurt, two people with knowledge of
the discussions said.  
 The sale process may start in September and value the
company at about 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion), said the
people, who declined to be identified as the matter is private.
PAI is interviewing about nine banks this week, the people said.  
 PAI, which manages a 2.7 billion-euro fund, is considering
selling its stake after jointly owning the Boulogne-Billancourt,
France-based yogurt maker since 2002. Sodiaal, France’s largest
milk cooperative, holds the other 50 percent. Leveraged buyout
fund managers are seeking to return cash to investors after the
credit crisis stymied deal-making for two years.  
 Yoplait, which has manufacturing facilities in France and
operates internationally through a franchise network, has
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
of about 120 million euros, another person said. General Mills
Inc. distributes Yoplait products in the U.S.  
 A sale agreement may not be reached before 2011, one of the
people said.  
 The nine banks trying to get hired include Citigroup Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., BNP Paribas SA, Lazard Ltd., Rothschild and
Societe Generale SA, people said.  
 A spokesman for PAI declined to comment.
