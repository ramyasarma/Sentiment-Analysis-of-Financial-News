             Corn fell in Chicago, extending the
biggest drop in seven weeks as a forecast for rain in parts of
the U.S. eased concern that dry weather will cause yield losses
in the world’s largest grower.  
 December-delivery corn slid 0.8 percent to $3.9075 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade at 11:38 a.m. Paris time. The
contract yesterday lost 3.3 percent, the most since May 28.
Wheat also declined.  
 “The driest corn and soybeans in central Illinois are
experiencing substantial rainfall,” T-Storm Weather LLC in
Chicago said in a report. Rains may also spread across drier
areas of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan, it said.  
 Prices were “weighed down by forecasts of rain for U.S.
crops and expectations of excellent U.S. crop conditions,”
Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a report e-mailed today.  
 Illinois is the second-largest U.S. soybean and corn
producer, and with Indiana, Ohio and Michigan accounted for 30
percent of the nation’s last harvest of both crops, according to
a January report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  
 About 72 percent of the U.S. corn crop was in good to
excellent conditions as of July 18, compared with 73 percent a
week earlier and 71 percent a year ago, the USDA said yesterday.  
 China, the second-largest corn consumer, sold 244,500
metric tons of the grain from state stockpiles in Inner
Mongolia, 250,600 tons in Jilin province and another 98,100 tons
in Liaoning province, the National Grain & Oil Trade Center said
today.  
 Wheat Declines  
 September-delivery wheat dropped 0.7 percent to $5.78 a
bushel. The grain’s 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of
whether a commodity is overbought or oversold, has mostly been
above 70 since July 7, a level some traders view as a signal
that prices are poised to decline.  
 “Steep losses in corn prices and a correction from a
recent rally weighed on prices,” Commonwealth Bank said. Still,
the bank said news remains mostly supportive of prices,
including an expanding drought in Russia and Kazakhstan and
exports from the U.S.  
 Milling wheat for November delivery fell 0.9 percent to
166.50 euros ($215.63) a ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  
 Ukraine will export 16 million tons of grain this year,
less than a previous estimate of about 20 million tons,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  
 Russia, the world’s third-largest wheat grower in the 2009-
10 season, may reduce grain exports should crop losses caused by
drought deepen, Arkady Zlochevsky, president of the national
Grain Union, said yesterday.  
 Wet Soil  
 Rain in Canada last week added to excessive soil moisture
in the nation’s main growing regions, the Canadian Wheat Board
said. Canada was ranked the second-largest wheat exporter in the
2009-10 season by the USDA.  
 The area in Canada seeded with wheat fell 7.1 percent to
22.7 million acres from a year earlier as wet weather kept
farmers out of fields, Statistics Canada said in June. A survey
due in August may show flooding caused further cuts, it said.  
 Soybeans for November delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$9.7475 a bushel in Chicago, erasing a drop of as much as 0.4
percent.
