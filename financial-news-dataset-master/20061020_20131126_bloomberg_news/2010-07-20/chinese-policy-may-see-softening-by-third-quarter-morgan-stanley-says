             China’s policy cycle has troughed
and investors may see a “visible softening” in the
government’s policy tone by the third quarter, according to
Morgan Stanley.  
 China may revise up its loan targets while investment
project approvals may be eased by the fourth quarter, Qing Wang
and Steven Zhang, Morgan Stanley economists, wrote in a note to
clients.
