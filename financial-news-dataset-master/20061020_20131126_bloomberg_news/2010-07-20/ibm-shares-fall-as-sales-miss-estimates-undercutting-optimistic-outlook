             International Business Machines
Corp. , the world’s biggest computer-services company, slid in
New York trading after missing analysts’ sales estimates and
reporting a drop in services-contract signings.  
 Revenue  last quarter rose 2 percent to $23.7 billion, IBM
said. Analysts on average estimated $24.2 billion, according to
a Bloomberg survey. Currency fluctuations reduced sales by $500
million, the company said.  
 Services-contract signings declined 12 percent to $12.3
billion, the Armonk, New York-based company said, for the second
straight quarterly drop.  
 “The market doesn’t want to hear words -- it wants to see
results,” said Edward Jones analyst  Andy Miedler , who rates the
shares “buy,” citing earnings growth.  
 IBM’s outlook remains healthy, Chief Financial Officer  Mark Loughridge  said on a conference call. Signings declined last
quarter because many customers didn’t extend contracts and some
clients put off signing them until this quarter, he said. IBM
actually increased new business signings, he said.  
 “I don’t think I would take this and interpret it as a
reflection that there’s a pullback in spending,” Loughridge
said. “The rollover of deals should accelerate performance.”  
 Outsourcing signings should have double-digit percentage
growth in this quarter, Loughridge said. Services growth, as
well as software revenue and new hardware products, will help
IBM raise total sales this quarter even with a currency impact,
he said.  
 Forecast Boost  
 IBM boosted its full-year profit forecast to at least
$11.25 a share, missing analysts’ average estimate of $11.28.
The company had previously projected profit of at least $11.20.  
 Net income  for the quarter climbed 9.4 percent to $3.39
billion, or $2.61 a share, topping analysts’ average estimate of
$2.58 a share.  
 The company gets almost a third of its revenue from Europe,
whose currency fell 9.4 percent against the dollar last quarter.
Although the impact from foreign-exchange rates was anticipated,
not all analysts took it into account with their estimates, said
Deutsche Bank AG analyst  Chris Whitmore .  
 “It’s going to be a headwind,” said San Francisco-based
Whitmore, who  rates  the shares “buy” and doesn’t own them.  
 Currency fluctuations hurt profit by about 10 cents to 11
cents a share, Loughridge said on the call. IBM also said it
would introduce its new mainframe computer, part of its System z
series, this week.  
 2015 Outlook  
 Chief Executive Officer  Sam Palmisano  expects IBM to almost
double operating earnings to $20 per share by 2015, as he
continues to focus on more lucrative software and services
businesses. The software segment, the company’s most profitable,
will make up about half of total earnings in five years,
Palmisano has said.  
 Palmisano plans to make about $20 billion in  acquisitions 
in that period. IBM is investing in markets such as analytics
software, which helps companies predict trends, and cloud
computing, which lets them store and access information on
shared servers. The company is also developing services to
monitor highways, electrical grids and other infrastructure to
help these systems run more efficiently.  
 Increased sales of those technologies, along with growth
markets such as Brazil and China, will add $20 billion to
revenue by 2015, IBM has said.  
 IBM also announced a shuffling of management duties at the
company yesterday, in an e-mail distributed to employees. Four
top executives will take on additional responsibilities as
Palmisano nears 60, the usual retirement age for the company’s
CEOs.  
 The company fell $3.24, or 2.5 percent, to $126.55 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have dropped 3.3 percent this year.
