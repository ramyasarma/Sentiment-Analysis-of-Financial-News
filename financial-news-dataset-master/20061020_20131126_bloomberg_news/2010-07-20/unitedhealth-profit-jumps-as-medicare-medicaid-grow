             UnitedHealth Group Inc. , the biggest
U.S. health insurer by sales, raised its full-year profit
forecast after increased enrollments and lower-than-projected
medical costs lifted second-quarter earnings 30 percent.  
 The insurer forecast 2010 profit of $3.40 to $3.60 a share
compared with a previous projection of $3.15 to $3.35, citing
growth in sales or membership for all business units.  Net income 
rose to $1.12 billion, or 99 cents a share, for the quarter,
from $859 million, or 73 cents, a year earlier, the company said
today. The earnings and forecast  topped   estimates .  
 Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hemsley  boosted enrollment
in Medicare Advantage, the U.S.-backed program for the elderly.
Weakness in the economic recovery in the U.S. also helped, by
keeping people away from doctors and hospitals, said  Jason Gurda , a Leerink Swann & Co. analyst in New York. UnitedHealth
did better than expected for commercial enrollment, taking
business from rival insurers, he said.  
 “If the consumers are tapped out and not getting as many
elected procedures and pushing off care, that’s ultimately
better for UnitedHealth,” Gurda said in a telephone interview.
“As long as the job market and consumer confidence remain soft,
hospital volumes and physician visits are likely to remain soft
as well.”  
 Forecast Raised  
 The company, based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, raised its 2010
revenue forecast by $1 billion, to $93 billion. Sixteen analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated $92.2 billion, on average,
and $3.32 a share in annual earnings.  
 UnitedHealth gained 1 cent to $30.83 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The company’s shares climbed
24 percent in the past 12 months.  
 Investors may worry that the earnings results will prompt
government to impose stricter rules on the industry, said
 Matthew Borsch , a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst in New York,
in a note to clients today.  
 The health-care law passed in March requires insurers to
spend at least 80 percent of the premiums they collect on
members’ medical care and gives states more money to scrutinize
“unreasonable” rate increases. State and federal regulators
are writing regulations to implement those provisions, Borsch
said.  
 “With criticism of the industry still intense and reform
regulations not finalized, market reaction may be mixed” to
UnitedHealth’s numbers, he said.  
 Sales Increase  
 Second-quarter revenue rose 7.4 percent to $23.3 billion,
the company said. That included increased  sales  in
UnitedHealth’s Prescription Solutions unit, which manages drug-
benefits for employers, and Ingenix, which analyzes health costs
to hospitals, employers and insurance companies.  
 The insurer sees health-services businesses as ripe for
growth under the new legislation because the overhaul puts a
premium on businesses that figure out ways to contain medical
costs, Hemsley said on a conference call with analysts today.
UnitedHealth announced the creation of a unit to invest in such
programs, including startups outside the company.  
 “Health-care reform has put a new kind of dynamic into the
marketplace around affordability and the need to modernize and
simplify” medical care, Hemsley said. “We’re pretty positive
as to what the prospects could be.”  
 Enrollment in UnitedHealth’s medical-benefit plans
increased to 32.5 million, from 32.1 million. Membership in
Medicare Advantage policies climbed 17 percent while Medicaid
enrollment rose 14 percent, the company said. Medicaid is a
federal and state program for the poor.  
 UnitedHealth said it spent 81.5 percent of the premiums it
collected for the quarter on medical care, down from 83.6
percent a year earlier.
