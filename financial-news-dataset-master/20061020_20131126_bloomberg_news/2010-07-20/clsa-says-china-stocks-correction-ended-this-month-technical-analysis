             China’s stocks , the worst performers
in Asia this year, probably ended a slump after reaching a low
earlier this month, according to CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets.  
 The  CSI 300 Index , a measure of yuan-denominated shares
traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, yesterday
rose the most in more than a week to close at 2,682.47. That’s
8.9 percent higher than this year’s intraday low of 2,462.20 on
July 2, near the 50 percent retracement level of the 2008 to
2009 advance, according to the Fibonacci sequence.  
 That “key support zone,” along with a “bullish
divergence” between its price and  14-day relative strength
index , a momentum indicator, suggests that the measure “has
either completed a corrective move from the August 2009 peak or
is close to doing so,” analysts  Laurence Balanco  and  Tiara Fontanilla  wrote in a report yesterday.  
 Even after its rebound this month, the CSI 300 has still
declined 25 percent in 2010, more than any other Asian benchmark
index. Shares have retreated on concern efforts to curb real
estate speculation and cool lending will slow the nation’s
economic growth even as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis weighs on
a rebound in exports.  
 A return to the “consolidating triangle pattern” seen in
the previous two months would be a positive for the CSI 300,
with a break above 2,788 “strengthening the argument that we
may have a low locked into place,” according to the analysts.  
 Any further  declines  should be limited by the 2,218 to
2,237 support zone, the analysts also said.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. The
ratios are based on the sequence pioneered by 13th century
mathematician Leonardo Pisano Fibonacci and used in technical
analysis to determine highs and lows for prices and predict
direction.
