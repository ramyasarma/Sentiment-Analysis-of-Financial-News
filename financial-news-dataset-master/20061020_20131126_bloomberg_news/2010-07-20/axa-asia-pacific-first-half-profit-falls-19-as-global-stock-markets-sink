             Axa Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd. , the
subject of a A$13.3 billion ($11.7 billion) takeover offer by
National Australia Bank Ltd., said fiscal first-half profit fell
19 percent as markets worldwide sank.  
 Profit after tax and non-recurring items dropped to about
A$220 million in the six months ended June 30 from A$270.4
million in the year-earlier period, the Melbourne-based
investment manager said in a statement today based on unaudited
numbers. Earnings included investment losses of A$60 million.  
 Stock indexes from the U.S. to Australia retreated in the
first half on concerns over Europe’s debt crisis and the
strength of the global economic recovery. Axa Asia Pacific,
controlled by France’s Axa SA, accepted a bid from National
Australia Bank and Axa in December and all three are seeking to
overcome Australian regulatory opposition to the deal.  
 First-half operating earnings rose 5.7 percent to about
A$270 million, Axa Asia Pacific said. The company proposed an
interim  dividend  of 9.25 cents a share, unchanged from last year.
Full results for the period will be announced on Aug. 4.
