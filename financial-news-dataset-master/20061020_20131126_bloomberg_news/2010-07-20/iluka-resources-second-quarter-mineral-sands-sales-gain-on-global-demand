             Iluka Resources Ltd. , the biggest
zircon producer, said second-quarter mineral sands sales gained
85 percent as demand surged in Asia, Europe and North America.  
 Revenue, before hedging, was A$229 million ($199 million),
from A$124 million a year ago, the Perth-based company said
today in a statement. Zircon production surged 55 percent to
104,700 metric tons, it said.  
 Demand, curbed by the global financial crisis, has
rebounded and the company is increasing output. In April, Iluka
said it had raised prices for zircon, mainly used in ceramics.  
 “Sales volumes in the first half of 2010 have recovered
from the historic low levels experienced in the first half of
2009,” Iluka said. “Demand recovery for zircon in 2010
reflects a rebound in demand in China to pre-global economic
crisis levels, a recovery in European demand and robust North
American demand. Demand for high grade titanium dioxide products
has also recovered.”  
 Iluka shares  rose 0.9 percent to A$5.40 at 10:15 a.m.
Sydney time on the Australian stock exchange.
