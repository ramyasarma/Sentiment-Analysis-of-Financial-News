             Boston Scientific Corp ., the world’s
second-largest heart-device maker, reported earnings that beat
estimates with sales of defibrillators recovering more quickly
from a monthlong recall than the company had projected.  
 Net income  fell 38 percent to $98 million, or 6 cents a
share, from $158 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier, the
Natick, Massachusetts-based company said today in a statement.
Adjusted for some items, profit of 12 cents a share beat the
average  estimate  of 3 cents in a Bloomberg survey of 18
analysts. U.S. defibrillator sales of $238 million beat the
company’s forecast by as much as 49 percent.  
 Boston Scientific pulled its defibrillators from the market
March 15 after saying it failed to notify U.S. regulators of
manufacturing changes. In April, the company wrote off $1.8
billion in costs from the recall. Chief Executive Officer
 Raymond Elliott  has said the recall will trim the company’s U.S.
market share in defibrillators by 4 percent in 2010.  
 “Boston basically dodged a bullet on this one,” said
 Derrick Sung , a New York-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co., said in a telephone interview. Defibrillator sales “came
in even stronger than I was expecting and were well ahead of
street estimates,” he said.  
 Defibrillator Sales  
 U.S. sales of defibrillator, the devices that shock hearts
to restore rhythm, were $238 million, exceeding the company’s
forecast of $160 million to $180 million. Sung had estimated
that U.S. defibrillator sales would be $227 million for the
quarter. Worldwide sales of defibrillators for the second
quarter were $379 million, compared with $308 million forecast
by Leerink Swann analyst  Rick Wise  and $364 million estimated by
Sung.  
 The U.S. defibrillator sales were still below the second
quarter of 2009, when they reached $315 million. Revenue for the
quarter fell 7 percent to $1.93 billion, matching analysts’
estimates.  
 The device maker lowered the top range of its 2010 sales
forecast to $7.9 billion from $8 billion previously estimated.  
 Boston Scientific rose 8 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $6.35
at 6:31 p.m. in extended  trading  on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company’s shares have fallen 32 percent in the past 12
months before today.
