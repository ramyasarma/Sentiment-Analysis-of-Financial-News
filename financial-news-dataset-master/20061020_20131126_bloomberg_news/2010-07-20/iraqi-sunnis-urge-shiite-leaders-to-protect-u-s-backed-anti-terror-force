             The Iraqi Islamic Party, one of the
country’s largest Sunni Muslim political groups, called on the
Shiite Muslim-dominated government “to live up to its
responsibility” and protect the Sahwa, a U.S.-created, anti al-
Qaeda security force.  
 The comments, in a  statement  on the party’s website, follow
three bombings targeting Sahwa members on July 18 that left at
least 44 people dead and dozens wounded. Iraqi leaders said al-
Qaeda carried out the attacks, among this year’s deadliest.  
 The Sahwa, also known as the Sons of Iraq or the Awakening
Councils, was organized by the U.S. military when attacks peaked
in 2006-2007 and includes Sunni tribesmen as well as former
insurgents. Prime Minister  Nuri al-Maliki ’s administration in
2008 took charge of the force, which now numbers about 90,000
men, and since then members have complained of being neglected.  
 In December, two Sahwa commanders were killed in roadside
bombings. Last month, gunmen raided the home of a tribe that had
publicly condemned al-Qaeda, shooting dead five members of a
family.
