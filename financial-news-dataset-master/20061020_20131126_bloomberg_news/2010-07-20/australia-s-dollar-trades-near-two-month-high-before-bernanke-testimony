             The Australian dollar declined
against the yen on speculation the slowing global economy will
deter the Reserve Bank of Australia from raising interest rates
next month.  
 The New Zealand dollar weakened against Japan’s currency on
concern stress tests of European banks will highlight the risk
of additional loan losses, boosting demand for safer assets.
Australia’s Bureau of Statistics will release consumer-price
data for the second quarter next week, after inflation almost
doubled in the first three months of the year.  
 “Until CPI comes out, it’s difficult to see where the
market’s going to get the next thrust in terms of pushing higher
yields in the money market and therefore the Aussie dollar,”
said  Michael Katz , a currency fund manager at Tallship
Investments in Sydney. “There’s certainly enough downside risk
to global activity and the RBA is unlikely to hike unless
they’re facing some serious pressure with domestic CPI.”  
 Australia’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to 77.01 yen at 1:24
p.m. in New York, from 77.35 yen yesterday. It slipped 0.2
percent to 88.26 U.S. cents, from 88.39 cents yesterday, after
climbing to 88.71 cents on July 14, the strongest since May 14.  
 New Zealand’s dollar slid 0.1 percent to 62.66 yen, from
62.75 yen yesterday, and rose 0.1 percent to 71.79 U.S. cents,
from 71.71 yesterday.  
 Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s July meeting
released yesterday showed policy makers plan to use this week’s
results of European bank stress tests and local inflation
figures to help decide whether to raise borrowing costs when
they meet Aug. 3 after keeping rates unchanged in June and July.  
 Swaps traders see a 26 percent chance the RBA will increase
rates, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG  index .  
 European regulators are scheduled to publish stress-test
results for 91 of the region’s banks on July 23.
