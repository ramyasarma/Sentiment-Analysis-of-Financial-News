             Johnson & Johnson  fell the most in
six weeks in New York trading after the company, the world’s
largest maker of health products, lowered its full-year earnings
forecast because of a series of over-the-counter drug recalls.  
 J&J dropped 99 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $58.58 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the biggest
decline since June 4. The shares are down 9.1 percent this year.  
 Profit, excluding special items, will be $4.65 a share to
$4.75 a share this year, J&J said today in a statement. That’s
down from the company’s April  projection  of $4.80 to $4.90. J&J
cited foreign currency exchange rates for the decrease and the
effects of the recalls, including a withdrawal of more than 40
types of children’s drugs from shelves in April because of
quality and potency that didn’t meet internal standards.  
 “J&J shares will likely be under pressure today, driven by
an even more dramatic lowering of guidance than we -- and we
believe the Street -- had anticipated,” Leerink Swann analyst
 Rick Wise  wrote today research note. Wise had estimated earnings
of $4.80. Based in New York, he recommends buying J&J shares.  
 Net income in the second quarter rose to $3.45 billion, or
$1.23 a share, from $3.21 billion, or $1.15, a year earlier, the
New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company said today in a
statement. Profit excluding some items was $1.21, meeting the
average  estimate  of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Sales Miss Estimates  
 Sales  rose 0.6 percent to $15.3 billion, missing 12
analysts’ average $15.7 billion estimate. The company lowered
its selling, marketing and administrative expenses by 0.9
percent, to $4.76 billion, and recorded an after-tax gain of $67
million from litigation.  
 “The results are solid, but in this market, satisfactory
is not enough,”  Joel Levington , managing director of corporate
credit at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York,
wrote today in an e-mail.  
 J&J derived 25 percent of its second-quarter  sales  from
Europe. The euro weakened 6.6 percent against the dollar in that
period, from the same one a year ago, according to Bloomberg
data. One euro bought $1.27 from April 1 through June 30 this
year, on average, while last year it bought $1.36.  
 U.S. sales declined 2.8 percent, while international sales
increased 4.1 percent aided by a favorable currency impact of
1.1 percent, J&J said today. A year earlier, sales outside the
U.S. fell 8 percent, pushed down by foreign exchange rates.  
 Investigation, Subpoena  
 The drugmaker is being investigated by the U.S. House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee after its April
recall. In January, J&J pulled 500 lots of drugs including
Rolaids, Motrin and some forms of Tylenol because of possible
contamination from a chemical on shipping and packing materials.
The company said June 24 that products made at its Fort
Washington, Pennsylvania, manufacturing facility, which produced
some of the recalled medicines, had annual sales of about $650
million in the last three years.  
 J&J suspended operations in April at the facility, and said
last week that the site will be closed until at least mid-2011.
J&J will cut 300 positions, or about 75 percent of the jobs at
the plant, as part of a reorganization plan submitted to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration July 15. The company also said
yesterday that it received an FDA inspection report of another
plant, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, that it operates with Merck
Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co., and that it “is fully committed
to addressing their concerns as rapidly as possible.”  
 Sales Forecast  
 The recalls and suspension of manufacturing will hurt 2010
sales by about $600 million, J&J Chief Financial Officer  Dominic Caruso  said today on a conference call. The company lowered its
sales forecast for 2010 to $62.5 billion from a previous
projection of $63 billion to $64 billion.  
 In the second quarter, revenue from consumer products
declined 5.4 percent to $3.65 billion, J&J said. Pharmaceutical
sales worldwide rose 1 percent to $5.55 billion, while revenue
from medical devices and diagnostics increased 4.1 percent to
$6.13 billion.  
 In the consumer-products unit, sales from over-the-counter
medicines and nutritionals declined 13 percent to $1.14 billion,
hurt by the recalls.  
 J&J also said today it had received a grand jury subpoena
from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania related to the pulled medicines.
