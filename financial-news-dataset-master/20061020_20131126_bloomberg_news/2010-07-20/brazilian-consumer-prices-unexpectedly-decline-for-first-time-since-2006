             Brazil’s  consumer prices 
unexpectedly fell in the month through mid-July, boosting
speculation that the central bank may slow the pace of interest
rate increases tomorrow. Yields on interest rate futures fell.  
 Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index fell 0.09
percent in the June 15-July 13 period, the first monthly
deflation in four years, the national  statistics agency  said.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected a 0.02 percent rise,
according to the median of 36 forecasts. The 12-month rate fell
to 4.74 percent from 5.06 percent in mid-June.  
 The yield on the interest-rate future contract maturing in
January, the most traded on Sao Paulo’s BM&F Exchange, fell for
a sixth straight day as signs of slower economic growth mount.
After raising the overnight rate twice this year by 0.75
percentage point, the central bank may ease the pace to a half-
point tomorrow, according to interest rate futures.  
 “I recognize that there’s a chance that the bank can
decide on 50 basis points,”  Tony Volpon , a Latin America
strategist at Nomura Securities, who expects a 75 basis-point
increase tomorrow, said. “The market is suffering from a
hangover after strong numbers in the first quarter.”  
 The interest-rate future contract with January delivery
fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 10.97
percent at 10:24 a.m. New York time. The yields on all traded
contracts maturing through January 2015 fell. The real gained
0.6 percent to 1.7827 per dollar from 1.7926 yesterday.  
 Counterpoint  
 While traders see room for a smaller interest rate
increase, economists forecast policy makers will increase the
Selic by 0.75 percentage point tomorrow, according to 36 of 38
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “I don’t think the central bank will slow the pace of
interest-rate hikes without communicating it to the market
first,”  Eduardo Castro , who helps oversee 100 billion reais
($56 billion) in Sao Paulo at Santander, Brazil’s fifth-biggest
fund manager, said in a telephone interview yesterday.
“Internal demand, credit and wage growth and the labor market
remain very strong.”  
 Policy makers are likely to choose a steeper increase
tomorrow and so give themselves room to pause before the Oct. 3
presidential election,  Andre Perfeito , an economist at Sao
Paulo-based Gradual Investimentos said.  
 Conflicting Signs  
 The central bank, led by its president,  Henrique Meirelles ,
has lifted the benchmark Selic rate twice in 2010, from a record
low 8.75 percent in March, to try and push the annual inflation
rate down toward its 4.5 percent target.  
 Today’s IPCA-15 inflation report showed that food prices
fell 0.8 percent in the month through mid-July, compared with a
0.42 percent drop in the same period a month earlier.  
 Transportation, clothing and education prices also fell
0.36 percent, 0.15 percent and 0.02 percent respectively.  
 The $1.6 trillion economy is showing signs of cooling from
an annual growth rate of 9 percent in the first quarter, its
fastest pace since 1995, after job creation and tax collection
in June trailed economists’ forecasts.  
 Brazil created 212,952 government-registered jobs in June,
down from 298,041 in May, according to the Labor Ministry.
Industrial output and retail sales expanded in May less than
analysts forecast.  
 Brazil’s economic growth will cool in the third quarter
after the government withdrew stimulus measures enacted during
the global financial crisis including tax cuts, Finance Minister
 Guido Mantega  said July 14.  
 Gross domestic product will rise 5.5 percent to 6 percent
in the third quarter from a year earlier, he said.
