             Cozumel Caribe SA, which provides
tourism services at a  beachfront hotel  in Mexico, filed for
bankruptcy court protection in the U.S., citing a slump in
foreign visitors.  
 The company listed debt of more than $100 million and
assets of more than $10 million in Chapter 15 documents filed
today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Chapter 15 protects
foreign companies from U.S. lawsuits and creditor claims while a
company reorganizes abroad.  
 “The recent world recession and crisis in the Mexican
tourism sector has brought about a reduction in the flows of
cash,” Nemias Esteban Martinez Martinez, a representative of
Cozumel Caribe, said in court papers.  
 The company provides tourism services through the Hotel
Park Royal Cozumel in Cozumel, Mexico, court papers show.  
 The case is In re Cozumel Caribe SA de CV, 10-13913, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
