             Cocoa rose in London and New York on
speculation excessive rains will curb supplies of the chocolate
ingredient from Ivory Coast, the world’s largest grower.  
 Black pod disease has developed in parts of the African
country after too much rain fell, causing some growers to cut
down trees, according to farmers and the state-owned Fund for
Developing and Promoting Coffee and Cocoa Activities. Ivory
Coast usually starts the larger of its two harvests in October.  
 “The rain is getting to the stage where it could be a
concern,” said  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.
in London. “We need some of the intensity to start to weaken
and more sun.”  
 Cocoa for September delivery gained 38 pounds, or 1.6
percent, to 2,383 pounds ($3,619) a metric ton at 11:20 a.m. in
London on the Liffe exchange. Prices yesterday dropped 4.1
percent, the most since July 22. The beans for September
delivery on ICE Futures U.S. in New York climbed 0.7 percent to
$3,002 a ton.  
 Prices are up 5.6 percent this year on Liffe on signs of
increased demand before new harvests in West Africa. The
exchange last week reported the delivery of 240,100 tons of
beans after the July future expired, the largest transfer since
1996. As of July 12, there were 246,810 tons of cocoa in
warehouses with valid grading certificates and another 51,460
tons of non-deliverable stockpiles, according to the exchange.  
 Warehouses monitored by ICE Futures U.S. had about 4
million bags, each weighing 145 pounds, in  storage  as of
yesterday, according to the exchange. That was down from 4.7
million bags at the end of March.  
 White, or refined, sugar for October delivery rose 0.4
percent to $536 a ton on Liffe. September-delivery robusta
coffee fell 1.2 percent to $1,709 a ton.
