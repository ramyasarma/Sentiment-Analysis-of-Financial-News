             Italy’s planned spending cuts will
curb economic growth and increase unemployment, said  Nichi Vendola , president of the southern Apulia region.  
 The 25 billion euros ($32 billion) in reductions over the
next two years “will produce a recession while aiming to fight
it,” said Vendola, who is also a candidate to become leader of
the center-left opposition. In “the view of many economists,”
the measures will cut “economic growth next year by as much as
1 percent and produce 100,000 new jobless,” he told reporters
in Rome today.  
 Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  won a Senate confidence
vote last week on the package, including 8.5 billion euros in
cuts to outlays to regions. The 20 regional presidents, nine of
whom are members of the ruling coalition, on July 9 threatened
to surrender their powers to manage local spending if the cuts
aren’t scaled back, saying they will jeopardize services such as
health care and transportation.  
 The measures, which also freeze civil-servant salaries,
must now be approved by the Chamber of Deputies to become law.
They aim to bring the budget  gap  under the European Union limit
of 3 percent of  gross domestic product  in 2012 from 5.3 percent
last year. The cuts will leave regions with “ample margins for
conserving and maintaining services,” Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  has said.  
 The Bank of Italy last week lifted its 2010 growth forecast
for Europe’s fourth-biggest economy to 1 percent from a previous
projection of 0.7 percent, saying  export gains  will drive the
recovery. Governor  Mario Draghi  said on July 15 that the impact
of the budget cuts can only be gauged in the “coming months.”
