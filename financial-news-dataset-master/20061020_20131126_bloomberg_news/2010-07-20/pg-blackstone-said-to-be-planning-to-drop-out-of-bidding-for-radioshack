             TPG Capital plans to drop out of
bidding for  RadioShack Corp. , according to a person briefed on
the talks. RadioShack’s  shares  fell the most in five months.  
 Blackstone Group LP , which had weighed a joint offer with
TPG, is not likely to pursue the electronics retailer on its
own, said another person with knowledge of the discussions. Bain
Capital LLC, which had separately expressed interest, also has
backed off, said a third person. All three people asked not to
be identified because the bidding process is private.  
 The company, led by Chief Executive Officer  Julian Day , is
advertising itself as The Shack and competing with larger Best
Buy Co. to sell mobile phones. RadioShack, based in Fort Worth,
Texas, cut capital spending by more than half in the first
quarter while boosting  net income  by 16 percent to $50.1
million. Cellular phone sales countered sinking demand for
digital converter boxes, video gaming devices and batteries.  
 “For RadioShack, the consumer electronics space is a
pretty tough place to play,” said  Peter Jankovskis , co-chief
investment officer at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois,
which manages $2.1 billion, including RadioShack shares. “It
had a strong brand that has faded.”  
 RadioShack fell $1.41, or 6.6 percent, to $20.05 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most
since Feb. 23. It lost as much as 10 percent earlier in the day.
Before today’s decline, the shares had gained 11 percent this
month, bringing the stock-market value to $2.69 billion, on
takeover speculation.  
 Spokesmen for TPG, based in Fort Worth, Blackstone in New
York and Boston-based Bain declined to comment.  Eric Bruner , a
spokesman for RadioShack, also declined to comment.  
 Barclays Plc recommended buying bullish RadioShack options
on July 16 because the company may rally if the company is sold
or after reporting increased profit from smartphone sales.
RadioShack has 6,500 stores, kiosks and other outlets in the
U.S. and Mexico.
