             BP Plc , the U.K. company battling a
record oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, agreed to sell assets in
North America and Egypt to  Apache Corp.  for $7 billion as part
of its plan to raise cash to fund liabilities.  
 The deals with Apache include BP’s Permian Basin holdings
in Texas and southeast New Mexico as well as gas properties in
western Canada, London-based BP said today in a statement. BP
also agreed to sell Western Desert business concessions and an
East  Badr El-din  exploration concession in Egypt.  
 The announcement comes after BP said it plans to sell some
$10 billion of assets over 12 months to help pay for damages
related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, caused by the explosion
of its Macondo well on April 20. BP said it expects the deals to
be closed in the third quarter.  
 “I think it should help BP in terms of increasing investor
confidence that they’ll have the liquidity to pay for the
Macondo incident without taking the company down,” said  Philip Weiss , an analyst at Argus Research in New York who has a
“hold” rating on BP’s American depositary receipts and owns
about 150 of them.  
 Apache fell 2.8 percent to $88.28 at 6:12 p.m., while BP’s
American depositary receipts rose 1.2 percent to $35.63.  
 Financing the Deals  
 BP said Apache will pay a deposit of $5 billion in cash on
July 30. The total price of $7 billion includes $3.1 billion for
the Permian properties, $3.25 billion for assets in western
Canada and $650 million for the Egyptian assets, according to
BP’s statement.  
 Apache, the largest U.S. oil company by market value among
companies that don’t own refineries or chemical plants, said it
will finance the acquisitions with debt and equity securities as
well as cash on hand.  
 The company said it received a $5 billion bridge loan to
backstop financing requirements and also announced plans to
offer 21 million shares of common stock and start an offering of
$1.1 billion of mandatory convertible preferred stock.  
 Apache said net production from the acquired properties was
about 83,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the first half
of this year. The deals add 2.4 million net acres to the
company’s portfolio.  
 BP was advised by Standard Chartered Plc. Apache’s advisers
included Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Apache Chief Executive Officer  Steven Farris  said in the
statement it was a “rare opportunity to acquire legacy
positions from a major oil company.”  
 ‘Didn’t Anticipate This’  
 “I didn’t anticipate this one,” Farris said in a
conference call. “If it hadn’t been for the Gulf incident, I’m
sure we wouldn’t be sitting here.”  
 Over the past few weeks, talks between BP and Apache
centered on a sale of part of BP’s stake in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay
field, along with the assets in the Permian Basin, western
Canada, and Egypt, said three people familiar with the matter.  
 In recent days, talks over the Prudhoe Bay stake fell apart,
these people said. The talks were complicated by the rights of
first refusal held by BP’s partners in the field and by a lack
of agreement over who would operate it, these people said,
speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks are
private.  
 The Prudhoe Bay stake was slowing down overall talks, said
one of these people, frustrating BP, which wanted to get the
deal done quickly.  
 No Advisers  
 The Prudhoe Bay stake on its own would have been worth
about $4 billion to $5 billion, two of the people said. Angered
by media reports about the talks, BP and Apache in the last few
days conducted much of the negotiations without their advisers,
one of these people said.  
 “I like this deal better for Apache than Prudhoe Bay
because they’re acquiring assets where they already are,” said
Weiss, the Argus analyst who also has a “hold” rating on
Apache shares and doesn’t own any. “This is really what Apache
does historically.”  
 Weiss said he was concerned about Apache’s ability to
digest three major deals within the last four months. Last
month, Apache closed on Gulf of Mexico assets acquired from
Devon Energy Corp. for $1.05 billion. The company also said in
April it would buy Mariner Energy Inc. in a deal valued at the
time at about $2.7 billion.  
 Farris said on the call that Apache may sell older BP gas
wells in Alberta.  
 The Houston-based company has bought mature fields from BP
in the past. Apache paid $1.3 billion in 2003 for BP assets in
the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea.  
 Apache said in a separate statement that second-quarter net
income almost doubled to about $860 million, or $2.53 a share,
from $443 million, or $1.31, a year earlier, as output climbed.
Excluding certain one-time items, Apache beat by 15 cents the
average estimate of 21 analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.

     BP seeks cash to meet the costs of the worst oil spill in U.S. history. BP's talks to sell half its stake in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay oil field to Apache Corp. stalled twice over the weekend, raising doubts about whether the deal will be completed, said a person with knowledge of the matter.(Source: Bloomberg)
