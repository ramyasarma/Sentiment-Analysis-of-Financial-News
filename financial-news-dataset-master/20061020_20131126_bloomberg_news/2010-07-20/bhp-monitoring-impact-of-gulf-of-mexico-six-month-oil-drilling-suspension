             BHP Billiton Ltd. , Australia’s
largest oil and gas producer, said a moratorium on deep-water
drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in response to the BP Plc
spill and aging fields limited gains in fourth-quarter output.  
 Drilling at the Atlantis and Shenzi fields in the Gulf
stopped during the quarter ended June 30, the Melbourne-based
company said in a statement today to the Australian stock
exchange. BHP said it continues to monitor the impact of the
suspension, imposed after the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 Oil and gas production rose 8 percent to 40.8 million
barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier on gains at the Pyrenees project off Western Australia
and the Shenzi field in the Gulf, BHP said. Full-year petroleum
output increased 15 percent to 158.6 million barrels.  
 BHP said its oil and gas unit, led by J.  Michael Yeager ,
delivered a third consecutive annual production record. “This
strong performance was partially offset by natural field decline
and the suspension of drilling activities in the Gulf of
Mexico,” the company said in its statement.  
 BHP, also the world’s largest mining company, boosted
petroleum exploration spending for the full year to $817 million,
the company said in a separate statement today.
