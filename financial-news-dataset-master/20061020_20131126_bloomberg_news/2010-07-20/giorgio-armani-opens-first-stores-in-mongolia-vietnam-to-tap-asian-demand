             Giorgio Armani SpA , the Italian
fashion company whose clothes are worn by celebrities including
 Angelina Jolie  and  Leonardo DiCaprio , said it opened its first
stores in Mongolia and Vietnam as it seeks to tap Asian demand.  
 Emporio Armani boutiques opened in Ulan Bator, Mongolia and
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where the clothier also added a cafe,
the Milan-based company said today in two e-mailed statements,
without saying when the outlets began trading.  
 Each country is “ready” for Italian fashion and design,
 Giorgio Armani , the closely held company’s founding president
and chief executive officer, said in the statements.  
 Armani is seeking to diversify its geographic sources of
revenue after profit fell 28 percent last year because of the
recession in North America and Japan. The company follows  LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA  in opening stores in Mongolia and
Vietnam. Sales of luxury goods in Asia Pacific, excluding China,
may rise 10 percent this year, Bain & Co. estimated in April.  
 Armani has 1,503 single-brand outlets worldwide.
