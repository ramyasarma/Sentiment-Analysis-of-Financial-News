             Ethiopia’s main opposition group
said its final legal appeal against the conduct of May’s general
election was rejected by the Court of Cassation today.  
 Medrek, a coalition of eight parties, made an unsuccessful
complaint to the National Electoral Board about irregularities
surrounding the May 23 poll, and then took the case to the
Supreme Court, which upheld the board’s decision. Today, the
Supreme Court’s decision was also upheld, Medrek spokesman
Negasso Gidada said by phone from the capital, Addis Ababa.  
 Ethiopian Prime Minister  Meles Zenawi’s  ruling party, the
Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front, with allied
parties, won all but two seats in the 547-member parliament.
Meles is a former Marxist guerrilla leader who has ruled sub-
Saharan Africa’s second-most populous nation since 1991.  
 “They said there were no legal grounds to oppose the
electoral board and supreme court’s decisions,” said Negasso.
“That means there’s no more legal ways for us to go.”  
 The coalition, that won one seat in Addis Ababa, will
consult its lawyers before deciding its next move, Negasso said.  
 The electoral board’s management of the election process
was praised by a European Union observer mission, though it
criticized the lack of a “level playing field for all parties”
and said the election “fell short of certain international
commitments.”  
 The Ethiopian government has rejected all criticism of a
process it described as “free and fair.”
