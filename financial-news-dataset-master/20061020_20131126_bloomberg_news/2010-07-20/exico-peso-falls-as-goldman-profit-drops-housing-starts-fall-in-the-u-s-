             Mexico’s peso gained the most in a
week as crude oil, the nation’s second-largest export, rose.  
 The peso rose 0.8 percent to 12.8046 per dollar, from
12.9021 yesterday, at 2:13 p.m. New York time. Earlier it
strengthened 0.9 percent, the most since July 13. The currency
has jumped 2.1 percent this year against the U.S. dollar, the
third-best performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, after Japan’s yen and Singapore’s dollar.  
 “The gain in oil at least lets you know that you are going
to have better revenue,” said  Omar Martin del Campo , a trader
at Banco Ve Por Mas SA in Mexico City. “In the long term, it
helps you have better economic numbers and more stable ones.”  
 Oil for August delivery rose 1.3 percent to $77.50 a
barrel. Oil is the nation’s second-largest export, after
automotive parts and vehicles.  
 The yield on the 10 percent bonds due in 2024 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.87 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.28 centavo to 128.53 centavos per peso.
