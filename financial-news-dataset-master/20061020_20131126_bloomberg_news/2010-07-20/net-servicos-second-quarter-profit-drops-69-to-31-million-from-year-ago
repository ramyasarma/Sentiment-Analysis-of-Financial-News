             Net Servicos de Comunicacao SA ,
Brazil’s biggest cable-TV provider, said second-quarter profit
fell 69 percent because of higher costs and currency losses.  
 Net income declined to 56 million reais ($31 million) in
the three months ended June 30 from 180 million reais a year
earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said today in a regulatory
filing. Profit missed the 73.3 million reais predicted by
analysts, the average of six  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales advanced 19 percent to 1.31 billion reais.  
 Operating costs rose 11 percent to 620.1 million reais in
the quarter as it paid more for programming, call-center
services and Internet bandwidth, according to the filing. A
decrease in the value of the real against the U.S. dollar led to
a loss of 15.9 million reais on Net’s dollar-denominated loans,
compared with a 133.1 million-real gain a year earlier.  
 “Net additions for broadband and voice came in a bit below
expectations,” Banco BTG Pactual SA said in a note to
investors. “Client-base penetration in both cases is already
very high, which justifies the numbers.”  
 The company ended the quarter with 3.88 million pay-TV
subscribers, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Its broadband
client base grew 19 percent to 3.1 million customers. Average
revenue per user grew 2 percent to 135.44 reais per household.  
 Net  rose  0.2 percent to 18.18 reais in Sao Paulo trading at
9:16 a.m. New York time. The shares had dropped 24 percent this
year before today, while Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index has
fallen 8 percent.
