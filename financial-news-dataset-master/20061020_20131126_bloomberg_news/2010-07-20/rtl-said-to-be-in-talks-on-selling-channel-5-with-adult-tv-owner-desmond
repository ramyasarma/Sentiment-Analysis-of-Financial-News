             Bertelsmann AG’s   RTL Group SA  is in
talks to sell its U.K. television station Channel 5 to  Richard Desmond , owner of the Daily Express newspaper and Television X
adult channel, a person with direct knowledge of the talks said.  
 Channel 5 may be sold for about 100 million pounds ($152
million), the person said, declining to be identified because
the discussions are private. A deal has yet to be finalized, the
person said. Spokespeople for RTL and Desmond’s Northern & Shell
holding company declined to comment.  
 RTL,  Europe’s biggest broadcaster  with 45 TV channels and
31 radio stations in 11 countries, repeatedly has said that the
U.K. TV market is overcrowded. RTL, based in Luxembourg, last
year called for a merger of Channel 5 with Channel Four
Television Corp., a publicly owned and commercially funded
broadcaster.  
 RTL’s Five Group, which runs Channel 5, posted  an operating
loss  of 10 million euros ($13 million) for 2009 as sales dropped
30 percent to 303 million euros. Its share of the television
advertising market dropped to 8.4 percent from 9.6 percent.  
 Desmond owns OK! magazine as well as adult television
subscription channels through his Northern & Shell holding
company. Desmond, who formerly published Penthouse magazine in
the U.K., sold his adult magazine titles in 2004.  
 RTL shares dropped 0.2 percent to 62.95 euros as of 11:06
a.m. The broadcaster is a unit of closely-held Bertelsmann AG,
Europe’s biggest media company. Bertelsmann owns 91 percent of
RTL.  
 The talks between Desmond and RTL were earlier reported by
Sky News.
