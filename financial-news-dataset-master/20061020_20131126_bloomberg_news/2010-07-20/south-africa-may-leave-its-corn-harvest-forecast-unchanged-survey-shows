             South Africa, the biggest corn
producer on the continent, will probably leave its forecast for
this season’s crop unchanged, a Bloomberg survey showed.  
 The government may say farmers will reap 13.3 million
metric tons in the season that started May 1, the same as
estimated last month, according to the median estimate of 13
traders surveyed by Bloomberg. Forecasts ranged from 13 million
tons to 14 million tons.  
 The government’s Crop Estimates Committee is scheduled to
release its assessment of the harvest at 2:30 p.m. local time on
July 22.  
 White corn for December delivery fell 33 rand, or 2.7
percent, to end trade at 1,177 rand ($154) a ton on the  South
African Futures Exchange . Meal made from the grain is the
country’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for September delivery dropped 36 rand, or 3
percent, to 1,171 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are the world’s
biggest corn exporters.
