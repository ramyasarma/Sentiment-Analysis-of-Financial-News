             Naphtha’s discount to crude oil, a
measure of refiner profitability, widened to the most since
August amid a buildup in stockpiles and concerns of slowing
economic growth in China limiting demand for petrochemicals.  
 Naphtha’s  crack spread to Persian Gulf benchmark crude
Dubai widened 73 cents to minus $6.66 a barrel, according to
data from broker PVM Oil Associates at 10:06 a.m. Singapore time.
That’s the lowest since Aug. 3, 2009, when it reached minus
$7.94. August  swaps  for the product in Singapore declined 19
cents to $67.36, PVM said.  
 Open-specification naphtha cargoes delivered in the second
half of August were bid at $612 a metric ton against offers at
$615 at 12:13 p.m., data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte show.  
 Naphtha  for delivery to Japan in September closed 1.6
percent lower at $620 a ton yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News.  
 Japanese naphtha stockpiles climbed 67,358 kiloliters in
the week ended July 10 to 2.05 million kiloliters, or 13.2
million barrels, the country’s petroleum association reported
yesterday. Supplies have risen after a fire caused the shutdown
of Formosa Petrochemical Corp.’s No. 1 naphtha-processing plant
on July 7. The facility, which can process 700,000 tons a year,
may restart in late September or early October, a company
spokesman said yesterday.  
 Gasoil Swaps  
 China’s economic expansion eased to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter and industrial production cooled more than
forecast in June. That may mean less demand at the country’s
petrochemical plants. Refiners had net-exports of naphtha in May
of 22,961 tons, according to Bloomberg calculations.  
 Gasoil  swaps for August in Singapore climbed 60 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $85.85 a barrel, PVM data showed. The product’s
 premium  to Dubai rose 6 cents to $11.83, PVM said. Jet fuel’s
premium to gasoil, or the regrade, was unchanged at $1.10, based
on PVM data. A widening level indicates aviation fuel was
profitable.  
 Asian 180-centistoke  fuel oil  swaps for August climbed
$2.75, or 0.6 percent, to $451.75 a ton, PVM data showed. The
product’s  discount  to Dubai widened 12 cents to $4.52 a barrel,
PVM said.  Swaps  for August for the 380-centistoke product rose
0.6 percent today to $444.25 a ton.
