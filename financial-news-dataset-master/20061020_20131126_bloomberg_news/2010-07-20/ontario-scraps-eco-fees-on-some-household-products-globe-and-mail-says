             The Ontario government will scrap an
“eco fee” on household products after criticisms from
consumers and retailers including Canadian Tire Corp., the Globe
and Mail reported.  
 Environment Minister  John Gerretsen  will announce today
that the government of Canada’s most populous province will
eliminate the new fees charged on aerosols, cleaning products
and other toxic items, the Globe said, citing government
officials. The fees, which ranged from one cent for a bottle of
hand sanitizer to C$6.66 ($6.32) for a fire extinguisher, were
introduced July 1, the Globe said.  
 Canadian Tire, the country’s largest hardware retailer,
said yesterday it would no longer charge customers the fees,
calling the program “confusing” to customers.
