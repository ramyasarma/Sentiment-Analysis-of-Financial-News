             Canadian mediators will supervise
discussions between locked-out longshoremen at the Port of
Montreal and their employer July 22 and 23, said Gilles
Corriveau, a spokesman for the Maritime Employers Association.  
 The lockout is costing member companies of the employers
association about C$800,000 ($757,000) weekly, Corriveau said
today in a telephone interview from Montreal.
