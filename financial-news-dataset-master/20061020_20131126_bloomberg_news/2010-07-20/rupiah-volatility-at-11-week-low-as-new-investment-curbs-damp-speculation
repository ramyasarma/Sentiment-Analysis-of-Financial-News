             Indonesia’s rupiah was little
changed, helping keep a measure of the currency’s volatility at
the lowest level in almost 11 weeks, after curbs on investment
in central-bank bills helped damp flows of speculative capital.  
 The rupiah has traded between 9,030 and 9,108 per dollar
this month, a range less than a quarter the size of those
recorded for May and June. Bank Indonesia has since July 7
required investors buying its bills to hold the securities for
at least one month.  
 “The rupiah’s price action is very subdued as offshore
interest has diminished quite a bit due to the BI measures in
the bills market to curb speculative activity,” said  Joanna Tan ,
a regional economist at Forecast Singapore Pte. “The currency
is very range-bound and will likely remain stuck in the 9,035 to
9,095 area.”  
 The rupiah traded at 9,059 per dollar as of 10:15 a.m. in
Jakarta, from 9,063 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has gained 3.6 percent this year, a
performance second only to Malaysia’s ringgit, as overseas
investors boosted their holdings of local-currency government
bonds by 56 percent to a record 168 trillion rupiah ($18.6
billion) and pumped $1.1 billion into Indonesian stocks.  
 The rupiah’s one-month implied volatility was 7.25 percent
for a third day, the lowest level since May 5, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It has averaged 10.0 percent this year,
down from 18.6 percent in 2009.  
 Rupiah-denominated bonds have returned 14 percent this year,
the biggest gain among 10 Asian local-currency debt indexes
compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc. Global funds owned a record 168
trillion rupiah ($18.6 billion) of government bonds as of July
16, 56 percent more than at the start of the year.  
 Indonesia’s benchmark  interest rate  of 6.5 percent compares
with a maximum 1 percent in the U.S., Europe and Japan and the
 Jakarta Composite Index  of shares has advanced 18 percent this
year.
