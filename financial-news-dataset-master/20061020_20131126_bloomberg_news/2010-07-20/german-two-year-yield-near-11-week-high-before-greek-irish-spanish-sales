             German two-year government note
yields declined from near their  highest  in almost three months
as stocks fell and Hungary failed to meet its target at a debt
sale, stoking demand for the safest fixed-income assets.  
 Hungary’s borrowing costs rose to a 19-week high at its
first offering since international creditors suspended talks
with the government. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.2 percent
and the Standard & Poor’s 500  index  fell 0.7 percent. Irish and
Greek 10-year yields dropped relative to those on German bunds
after demand rose at the so-called peripheral nations’ debt
auctions, easing concern they won’t be able to fund their budget
deficits.  
 “Stocks are falling and the Hungarian situation isn’t
helping risk appetite, and that’s given a bit of a bid to
bunds,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA
Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh.  
 The two-year German yield fell five basis points to 0.79
percent at 3:43 p.m. in London. The 0.5 percent security due
June 2012 rose 0.1, or 1 euro per 1,000-euro ($1,289) face
amount, to 99.465. The yield rose to 0.84 percent yesterday, the
highest since April 28. The 10-year yield fell one basis point
to 2.65 percent.  
 Hungary raised less than targeted for the fourth time since
June, selling 35 billion forint ($156 million) of three-month
Treasury bills, compared with the 45 billion forint planned, the
debt management agency’s Bloomberg page shows. Total bids at the
weekly auction were 52.5 billion forint. The average yield was
5.47 percent, the highest since March 2, up from 5.28 percent.  
 Ireland, Spain  
 The International Monetary Fund and European Union ended
talks with Hungary on July 17 without endorsing the nation’s
deficit-control plan. The forint fell to the lowest since April
2009. Central bank President  Andras Simor  said a “sustained
increase” in risk premiums may prompt higher interest rates.  
 The premium that investors demand to hold 10-year  Irish
bonds  over benchmark German bunds narrowed 7 basis points to 277
basis points, while the Spanish-German yield spread was 6 basis
points tighter at 170 basis points. The Greek-German spread
narrowed by 7 basis points to 771 basis points.  
 Today’s sale of Irish and Spanish securities follows
auctions by Greece and Portugal last week, which garnered
greater demand than anticipated. Ireland’s credit rating was cut
one step to Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service yesterday.  
 ‘Solid Buying’  
 Spain sold 4.25 billion euros of 12-month bills today at an
average yield of 2.221 percent, compared with 2.303 percent at
the last sale on June 15. Demand was 1.95 times the amount sold,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.49 the last time the
securities were sold in June. It also sold 1.72 billion euros of
18-month bills at 2.331 percent, compared with 2.837 percent in
June. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.44 compared with 3.51 at a
previous sale.  
 “Demand for Spanish paper has been very strong,” said
 Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-rate strategy at Credit
Agricole CIB in London. “We’re seeing solid buying from real
money accounts,” Jellinek said in an interview with Bloomberg’s
 Ken Prewitt  on Bloomberg Radio’s “First Word.”  
 Investor sentiment toward Spanish debt has improved on
perceptions that European regulators’ plan to publish the
results of bank stress testing this week “will bring clarity,”
according to  Gianluca Salford , a fixed-income strategist at
JPMorgan Chase Bank in London.  
 Appetite Undiminished  
 Ireland sold 750 million euros of 4.6 percent 2016 notes at
an average yield of 4.5 percent, attracting 3.6 times more bids
than securities sold, up from 3.1 times at a previous sale. It
also sold 750 million euros of 5 percent 2020 bonds at an
average yield of 5.54 percent, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3,
the same as at an earlier auction.  
 “The market’s appetite for Spanish, Portuguese and Irish
debt hasn’t diminished,” said  Philip Shaw , chief economist at
Investec Securities in London on Bloomberg Radio’s “First
Word.”  
 Demand at the Greek bill sale was 3.85 times the securities
offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.64 times at an
auction of 26-week securities a week ago, data from the debt
agency in Athens showed today. The bills were sold at 4.05
percent. It was the country’s second sale since it received an
EU rescue package in May to stave off the threat of default.  
 “Greek markets are shut beyond around three to six months,
and there’s little hope of the Greek government being able to
issue longer-term paper for quite some time,” Shaw said. “The
Greek authorities are very keen on saying that markets aren’t
completely closed for us, and this is their second issue of very
short-term paper over the past fortnight.”  
 German government bonds returned 6.4 percent this year,
compared with 6.1 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 6.14 percent
for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit.
