             South African Airways Ltd., the
country’s national carrier, said it’s seeking to recover 30.8
million rand ($4 million) from former Chief Executive Officer
 Khaya Ngqula  after claiming he spent its money on friends and
awarded contracts to companies in which he had an interest.  
 An investigation by accounting firm KPMG showed Ngqula went
beyond his duties in increasing retention bonuses for some
employees and sponsoring the Association of Tennis Professionals
and professional golfer  Angel Cabrera , the airline said. Ngqula
took friends and associates to the soccer and rugby world cups
and a tennis tournament in Monte Carlo, according to an e-mailed
copy of a letter from KPMG to SAA Chairwoman Cheryl Carolus.  
 “The board has resolved to institute action against Dr.
Ngqula for the recovery” of his unauthorized excess
expenditure, the Johannesburg-based company said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Several calls to Ngqula’s mobile phone seeking comment
didn’t connect.  
 SAA paid Ngqula 9.35 million rand to end his contract in
March 2009 after the South African Transport & Allied Workers’
Union asked for an investigation into procurement practices.
Since 2001, the government of Africa’s biggest economy has paid
chief executives of state-owned enterprises severance packages
worth a total of 262.1 million rand as they were fired,
suspended or while the company was running at a loss, the
opposition Democratic Alliance said on its website.  
 While heading South Africa’s biggest airline from 2004 to
2009, Ngqula awarded portions of three jet-fuel contracts to
suppliers in which he had an interest, KPMG’s letter said.
