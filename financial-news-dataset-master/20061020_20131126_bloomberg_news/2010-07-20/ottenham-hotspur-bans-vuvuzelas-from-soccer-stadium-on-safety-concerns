             Tottenham Hotspur banned vuvuzela
horns from its soccer stadium, becoming the first English
Premier League club to outlaw the plastic instruments heard
droning throughout the World Cup in South Africa.  
 Tottenham said it made the decision to prohibit fans from
bringing vuvuzelas or similar instruments into White Hart Lane
on match days following discussions with the police and local
licensing authorities.  
 “We are concerned that the presence of the instruments
within the stadium pose unnecessary risks to public safety and
could impact on the ability of all supporters to hear any
emergency safety announcements,” the London club said yesterday
in a statement on its  website .  
 The Premier League said during the World Cup that it would
be left to individual clubs to decide whether to ban the
vuvuzela, which is said to mean “to make a loud noise” in
Zulu. Tottenham opens the 2010-11 league season Aug. 14 at home
to Manchester City.  
 Arsenal today joined its north London rival in banning the
horns “to ensure the enjoyment and safety of supporters on
matchdays, which is of paramount importance to the club.”  
 The drone of vuvuzelas became part of the experience of the
first World Cup hosted in Africa. Fans blew them throughout
games, drowning out the players’ attempts to communicate and
stadium announcements. Hearing aid maker Phonak AG estimates the
noise reaches 127 decibels, louder than a chainsaw.  
 “We are very proud of the fantastic atmosphere that our
supporters produce organically at White Hart Lane and we are all
very much looking forward to this continuing into the
forthcoming season,” Tottenham added in the statement.

                          June 17 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg's Matt Teale reports from Johannesburg on the Vuvuzela, the foot-long trumpets that are creating the buzz at the World Cup in South Africa.
     The drone of the vuvuzelas has become part of the experience of Africa’s first World Cup. Fans blow them throughout matches, drowning out the referee’s whistle, the players’ attempts to communicate and stadium announcements. Hearing aid maker Phonak AG estimates the noise reaches 127 decibels, louder than a chainsaw. (Source: Bloomberg)
