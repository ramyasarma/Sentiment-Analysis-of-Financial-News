             Adani Enterprises Ltd. , India’s
largest non-state trader of farm goods, plans to raise as much
as $850 million selling equity to institutional investors.  
 Adani will offer the shares for about 536.15 rupees apiece,

Stanley, Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit, IDFC

Enam Securities Pvt. and Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. are managing
the offering, the document showed.  
 Adani is in advanced talks with Linc Energy Ltd. to  acquire 
coking coal assets in Australia, the Brisbane-based company said

having a total capacity of 13,200 megawatts, may buy the Galilee

 Adani Enterprises , based in Ahmedabad in the western state
of Gujarat, has shareholder approval to raise as much as 40
billion rupees ($845 million), according to a filing to the
Bombay Stock Exchange on June 16.  
 The company will invest the money from the share sale for
its coal mining and oil and gas exploration businesses, and to
repay loans, the term sheet showed.  
 Adani shares fell 0.2 percent to 543.80 rupees in Mumbai,
compared with a 0.3 percent decline in the benchmark Bombay
