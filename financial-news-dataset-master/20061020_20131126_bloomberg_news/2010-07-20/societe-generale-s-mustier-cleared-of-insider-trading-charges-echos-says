             Paris prosecutors have cleared
former Societe Generale SA investment banking chief Jean-Pierre
Mustier of insider trading, Les Echos reported, without citing
anyone.  
 In June, Mustier was fined 100,000 euros by France’s
Autorite des Marches Financiers for selling shares of the bank
before it announced losses tied to subprime mortgages. The case
was referred to the prosecutors by the AMF, Les Echos said.
