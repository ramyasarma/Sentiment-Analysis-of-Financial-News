             The European Union is poised to
adopt “comprehensive and robust” sanctions against Iran over
its disputed nuclear program,  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  reported,
citing a draft statement circulating before a meeting of EU
foreign ministers.  
 While the bloc will reiterate its call for a diplomatic
solution to the standoff, additional measures are set to be
adopted in trade, banking, energy, transport as well as visa
bans, DPA cited the document as saying. EU foreign ministers are
scheduled to meet in Brussels next week.  
 The United Nations Security Council on June 9 approved a
fourth round of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program.
