             Japanese  bonds  fell for a second day
after the Asian Development Bank raised its growth forecast for
the region, adding to speculation recent gains in government
debt were overdone.  
 Ten-year yields climbed from near a two-week low as Asian
stocks advanced on speculation corporate earnings will keep
improving, damping demand for the safety of debt. The ADB
 projected  developing Asian nations will expand 7.9 percent in
2010, from its April forecast of 7.5 percent, citing “buoyant”
exports and strong private demand.  
 “With a recovery of corporate profit remaining intact in
spite of such odds as a strong yen, investments on equities now
offer attractive returns in comparison to investments on low-
yielding bonds,” said  Tsuyoshi Segawa , a Tokyo-based strategist
at Mizuho Securities Co., part of Japan’s second-largest lender.  
 The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond rose half a basis
point to 1.09 percent as of 3:17 p.m. at Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.1 percent
security due June 2020 fell 0.045 yen to 100.089.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery dropped 0.05
to finish at 141.61 at the afternoon close on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The 10-year yield declined 6.5 basis points last week,
the biggest drop since the period ended Nov. 13.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific  Index of shares gained 0.2 percent,
snapping a three-day decline. The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average pared
its losses to 1.2 percent from 1.7 percent. Companies in the
Nikkei will post a 91 percent surge in earnings per share this
fiscal year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Yen Weakens  
 The yen weakened 0.4 percent to 87.01 per dollar, after
advancing to a seven-month high of 86.27 on July 16. A stronger
currency reduces the value of overseas income at Japanese
companies in yen terms.  
 The decline in bonds was tempered before reports today that
economists said will show U.S. housing starts dropped and
European industrial orders fell.  
 U.S. builders began work on 577,000  houses  last month at an
annual rate, the fewest this year, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before today’s report.  Industrial orders  in the euro area
fell 0.1 percent month-on-month in May, a separate survey showed
ahead of the July 22 data.  
 The  Ministry of Finance  will sell 1.1 trillion yen ($12.6
billion) in 20-year bonds on July 22. The previous auction on
June 16 drew bids for 4.6 times the amount on offer, compared
with a so-called  bid -to-cover ratio of 3.93 in May.
