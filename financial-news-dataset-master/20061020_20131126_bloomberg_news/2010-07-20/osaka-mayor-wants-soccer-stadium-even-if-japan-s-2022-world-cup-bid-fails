             Osaka Mayor  Kunio Hiramatsu  backs a
plan to build an 80,000-seat sports stadium next to the city’s
busiest rail station even if Japan fails in its bid to host the
2022 FIFA World Cup.  
 “It could also serve as a health and fitness center,” he
said today at a news conference while representatives of FIFA,
soccer’s governing body, visit Japan on an inspection tour.
“The aim would be to build facilities where people can also
enjoy the field inside the stadium even when no games are on.”  
 Hiramatsu, 61, said the  Kita Yard  redevelopment area, which
covers 240,000 square meters (2.6 million square feet) on the
north side of Osaka Station, should have “an environmental
element” and house more than offices and shops. About 2.5
million people pass through Osaka Station each day, he said.  
 Japan, which jointly held the World Cup with South Korea in
2002, is vying with countries including Australia and Russia to
host the soccer tournament in 2022. The sport’s ruling body in
December will announce the hosts of the 2018 and 2022
tournaments.  
 The FIFA officials were also today scheduled to visit Osaka
Castle’s Nishinomaru Park, proposed as a venue for fan
gatherings, and a training facility in Sakai, a city in southern
Osaka Prefecture. They travel to Tokyo tomorrow and visit South
Korea, which is also bidding for the 2022 tournament, starting
on July 22.
