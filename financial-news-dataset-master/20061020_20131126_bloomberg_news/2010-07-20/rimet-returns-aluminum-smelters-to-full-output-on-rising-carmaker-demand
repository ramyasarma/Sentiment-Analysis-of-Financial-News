             Trimet Aluminium AG , Germany’s
biggest producer of the lightweight metal, returned its smelters
to full capacity on improved demand from carmakers.  
 Output probably will come to “roughly” 250,000 metric
tons of primary aluminum this year, board member  Martin Iffert 
said in an e-mail sent yesterday. The Essen, Germany-based
company’s two smelters can process 300,000 tons of metal
annually, he said. They were running at about 80 percent of
capacity in March.  
 “Ramp-up to full capacity started at the beginning of 2010
as a response to increasing demand from the downstream aluminum
industry, specifically the automotive industry,” Iffert said in
the e-mail in response to questions.  
 Trimet reduced production at the start of 2009 as the
global economy sank into its deepest recession since World War
II, hurting demand for industrial metals. Global aluminum
consumption dropped 4.4 percent last year and will rebound 12
percent this year as the world economy recovers, according to a
report from Barclays Capital on July 16.  
 An average North American vehicle contains 340 pounds of
the metal, according to the  website  of the Aluminum
Transportation Group, made up of members including Alcoa Inc.
Consumption of aluminum in light trucks, sport utility vehicles
and minivans has tripled since 1991, the site shows. The metal
is used in industries from packaging to aerospace.  
 Recycling Plants  
 Production was down to half of capacity in January at
Trimet’s 170,000 ton-a-year smelter in Essen and the Hamburg
plant, which can process 130,000 tons of metal, according to
Iffert. Still, the drop had no effect on Trimet’s recycling
activities, he said.  
 Total production at the family-owned company’s recycling
plants in Gelsenkirchen, Harzgerode and Essen is estimated at
150,000 tons of aluminum per year, according to the e-mail.  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$1,961 a ton at 11:55 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange. Prices
have dropped 12 percent this year after a 45 percent jump in
2009.  
 The metal for immediate delivery will average $1,989 a ton
this year, rising to $2,150 next year, according to Barclays
Capital. That compares with an average so far this year of
$2,114 for spot aluminum.
