             State Street Corp. , the third-
largest custody bank, said stock-market gains and acquisitions
boosted assets and helped to lift second-quarter revenue by 8.6
percent to $2.3 billion.  
 Fees earned for safekeeping assets rose 20 percent from a
year earlier to $957 million, the Boston-based company said
today in a statement. Investment management fees rose 12 percent
to $217 million.  
 The jump in fees offset the low interest rates that
continue to hurt custody banks by squeezing profit margins on
lending services and forcing them to waive fees on money-market
funds in order to maintain yields. The U.S. Federal Reserve has
held its benchmark lending rate at zero to 0.25 percent since
December 2008.  
 “Rising custody assets are a good thing but I don’t think
it’s an indication of any sustainability for the rest of the
year,”  Thomas McCrohan , an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC in Philadelphia, said in an interview before State Street
announced earnings. “They need the interest-rate environment to
improve.”  
 Custody assets rose 13 percent to $14 trillion while the
average value of the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  in the second
quarter advanced 27 percent from the same period in 2009. State
Street also added $686 billion from the acquisitions of Mourant
International Finance Administration in the U.K.’s Channel
Islands and the securities-servicing unit of Italy’s Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA. The Mourant deal closed in April and the Intesa
acquisition was completed May 17.  
 The money that State Street invests for clients rose almost
15 percent to $1.78 trillion in the quarter.  
 Revenue Sources  
 Revenue from trading services, which include foreign
exchange, increased 5.2 percent to $326 million. Revenue from
securities lending fell 46 percent to $109 million.  
 Expenses rose 43 percent to $1.94 billion, primarily
because of a $251 million after-tax charge to boost the value of
funds managed within the firm’s securities-lending business. On
an operating basis, expenses rose 8.6 percent to $1.47 billion.  
 After-tax unrealized losses in State Street’s investment
portfolio declined 31 percent in the three months ended June 30
to $994 million. The amount shows losses State Street would have
if forced to sell the securities at current market prices.  
 Preliminary Results  
 State Street released preliminary results on July 7. Net
income was 87 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.18
billion, or $7.12, a year earlier, when the firm wrote down the
value of investments by $3.7 billion and repaid government
bailout money.  
 Full results were announced before the start of regular
U.S. trading. State Street has declined 14 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with the 11 percent decline for
S&P’s 15-member  index  of asset managers and custody banks.  
 Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the world’s biggest custody
bank, today said second-quarter earnings more than tripled to
$658 million, or 54 cents a share, from $176 million, or 15
cents, a year earlier.  
 Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend
securities to institutional investors including mutual funds,
pension funds and hedge funds. The company’s money-management
unit, State Street Global Advisors, operates mutual funds and
investment accounts for institutions and wealthy individuals.  
 State Street, which derives about a third of its operating
revenue from servicing fees, trails only BNY Mellon and JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in custody-bank assets.

investors at 9:30 a.m. New York time. The call can be accessed
