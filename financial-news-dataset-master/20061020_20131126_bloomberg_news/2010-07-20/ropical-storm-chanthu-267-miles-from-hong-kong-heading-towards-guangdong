             Severe Tropical Storm Chanthu
approached the coast of China’s Guangdong province, passing
southwest of Hong Kong today and bringing rains and winds to the
city.  
 The Hong Kong Observatory raised a No. 3 strong wind signal
at 4:40 p.m., replacing the No. 1 standby signal that had been
in place since yesterday.  
 Chanthu was about 410 kilometers (255 miles) south-
southwest of Hong Kong, the city’s Observatory  said  in a
statement at 3:45 p.m. The storm was moving about 12 kilometers
per hour and forecast to make landfall in China tomorrow, the
Observatory said on its website.  
 Chanthu brought maximum sustained winds of 55 kilometers
per hour to Hong Kong’s Cheung Chau island, the Observatory said.  
 The storm may exacerbate flooding in China. Rainfall since
July 1 has affected about 38 million people and forced the
relocation of 1.3 million in 11 provinces, the Ministry of Civil
Affairs said last week.
