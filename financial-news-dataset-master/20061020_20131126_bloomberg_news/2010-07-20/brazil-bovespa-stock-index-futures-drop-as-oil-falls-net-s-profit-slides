             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index gained
for a second day, climbing to the highest level in three weeks,
as traders eased bets for interest-rate increases and the
measure’s heaviest-weighted stock rallied the most since May.  
 Vale SA , the world’s largest iron-ore producer, jumped 6.2
percent amid speculation China, the biggest consumer of the
steelmaking ingredient, will ease measures to curb growth.
Steelmakers  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA  and  Cia.
Siderurgica Nacional SA  rallied for a second session.  Empresa
Brasileira de Aeronautica SA , the world’s fourth-largest
planemaker, surged the most since 2009 after winning orders
worth $1.9 billion.  
 The  Bovespa  increased 1.8 percent to 64,462.50, the highest
level since June 25, at the close of trading in Sao Paulo at 4
p.m. New York time. Forty-four stocks gained on the measure
while 19 fell. The real strengthened for the first time in five
days, gaining 1 percent to 1.7740 per dollar.  
 “The monetary policy committee might not have to raise
rates as much,” said  Roberto Sevalli , who oversees 380 million
reais ($214 million) as director of Parana Banco Asset
Management in Curitiba, Brazil. “The market here has
strengthened a bit more than the American one.”  
 The  Bovespa  rose the most in a week yesterday on
speculation companies will report second-quarter profit growth
and as rising commodities prices boosted producers.  
 Brazil’s consumer prices unexpectedly fell in the month
through mid-July. Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15
index dropped 0.09 percent in the June 15-July 13 period, the
first monthly deflation in four years, the national statistics
agency said today.  
 Interest Rate Bets  
 Brazilian traders are wagering that policy makers will lift
the benchmark interest rate a half percentage point this week
even as economists maintain forecasts for a bigger increase.  
 The average estimate fell to a 50 basis-point change from
75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage point, according to yields
on interest-rate future contracts maturing Aug. 2. The call
clashes with forecasts by 36 of the 38 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg for the central bank to raise the overnight rate to 11
percent from 10.25 percent.  
 Vale  jumped 2.40 reais, the most since May 27, to 40.90
reais after Claudio Alves, director for iron-ore sales in the
Americas, said the company is producing the steelmaking
ingredient at full capacity as Chinese demand rebounds. China is
starting to rebuild steel stockpiles, while the U.S. and Europe
will likely increase inventories in the fourth quarter, Alves
said today at an event in Rio de Janeiro.  
 Embraer Rallies  
 Usiminas, Brazil’s second-biggest steelmaker, increased 3.6
percent to 50.48 reais while CSN, the third-biggest, gained 5.3
percent to 27.63 reais.  
 Embraer, as the Brazilian planemaker is known, climbed 6.1
percent to 10.20 reais. The company won orders for 50 regional
jets worth almost $1.9 billion at list prices, trumping larger
competitor Bombardier Inc. Flybe, Britain’s biggest domestic
airline, purchased 35 88-seat Embraer 175 aircraft worth $1.3
billion, while Steven Udvar-Hazy’s Air Lease Corp. said at the
Farnborough Air Show that it would buy 15 larger 190 planes
valued at $600 million.  
 MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA , Brazil’s fifth-biggest
homebuilder by revenue, fell the most in a month, losing 3.6
percent to 14.56 reais, after Credit Suisse Group AG downgraded
the stock and said investors are underestimating the risk of a
slowdown in government housing aid.  
 “We believe the market is paying very little attention to
a potential momentary deceleration in MCMV program towards the
end of the year, associated with the elections and a change in
government staff,” Credit Suisse analysts including  Marcello Milman  wrote, referring to the government’s Minha Casa, Minha
Vida program to finance low-cost housing.  
 The  Bovespa index  trades for 11.8 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.6 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.3
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.4 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.
