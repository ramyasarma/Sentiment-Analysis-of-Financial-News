             As Russia suffers its worst drought
in a decade, officials advised grain farmers in central Oryol
province to start harvesting at night to protect their combines
against mechanical breakdowns in the daytime heat.  
 Farmers in Oryol, 380 kilometers (235 miles) south of
Moscow, also must prevent fires from breaking out in their
fields, the head of the provincial agriculture department,
Vladimir Koroteev, said yesterday in  comments  posted on the
Oryol government’s website.  
 Most of Russia’s grain-growing heartland -- its central
provinces and the Volga River region -- will suffer from
“abnormal” temperatures as high as 37 degrees Celsius (98.6
degrees Fahrenheit) and a severe risk of fire through July 25,
the Federal Hydrometeorological Service  said  today. Temperatures
in central Russia will exceed the historical average by at least
4 degrees Celsius between July 20 and July 29, the service said.  
 The Agriculture Ministry said it may declare weather-
related emergencies in two additional crop-producing provinces,
raising to 19 the total number of farming provinces facing such
an emergency. The country is experiencing its worst wave of hot,
dry weather for at least 10 years, the ministry said.  
 Farmers in Oryol had harvested 479,000 metric tons of
grain, or 21 percent of their planted areas, as of July 19,
Koroteev said. Yields for wheat, barley and other grains
averaged 2.9 tons per hectare, he said.  
 Oryol Governor Alexander Kozlov said the government will
punish any attempts to steal or understate the grain crop.
