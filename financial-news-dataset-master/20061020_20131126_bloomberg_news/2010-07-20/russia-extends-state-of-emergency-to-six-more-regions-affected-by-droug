             Russia’s government declared a state
of emergency in six more crop-producing regions due to the worst
drought in at least a decade, bringing the total to 23.  
 Farmers harvested 17 percent of grain crops throughout the
country as of today, reaping 21 million tons, or 715,300 metric
tons more than at the same time last year, the Agriculture
Ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. Yields averaged
2.81 tons a hectare (2.4 acres), down from 3.11 tons a hectare
last year, it said.  
 Farmers in the Southern federal district harvested 47
percent of their planted areas, reaping 11.9 million tons of
grain, it said. Yields averaged 3.66 tons a hectare, compared
with 3.3 tons a hectare last year.  
 The drought-hit Volga region harvested 1.4 million tons of
grain, the ministry said. Yields averaged 0.93 ton a hectare,
compared with 1.26 tons last year. Regions in central Russia
harvested 1 million tons of grain, with yields 29 percent lower
at 2 tons a hectare.  
 The wheat harvest stands at 15 million tons, with yields
at 2.89 tons a hectare. The barley harvest came to 2.1 million
tons, with yields averaging 3.24 tons a hectare.
