             Tropical storm Chanthu shifted
direction away from Hong Kong as it crossed the South China Sea
toward China, the U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center said.  
 Chanthu was about 505 kilometers (314 miles) south-
southeast of Hong Kong at 2 p.m. China time today, the center
said on its  website . The storm was moving north-northwest and
may hit China’s southern coast about 195 kilometers west of Hong
Kong within 36 hours, the center said.  
 The storm’s maximum sustained winds were 65 kilometers per
hour (40 miles per hour) and may strengthen to 83 kph in the
next 24 hours as it approaches China, the center said. Waves
reached as high as 4.6 meters (15 feet).  
 The  Hong Kong Observatory  said meteorologists within the
next few hours may issue a warning, called a No. 3 Strong Wind
Signal, indicating sustained winds may reach 41 kph to 62 kph
with gusts of more than 110 kph.  
 The storm may exacerbate flooding in China, where rainfall
since July 1 has affected about 38 million people and forced the
relocation of 1.3 million in 11 provinces, the Ministry of Civil
Affairs said last week. Eleven people were missing after a
landslide in China’s southwest province of Sichuan demolished
homes, Xinhua News Agency reported today.  
 Last week, typhoon Conson left 76 people dead and 72
missing in the Philippines after it battered the country’s most
populous island of Luzon, knocking out power and damaging more
than 30,000 houses, the country’s  National Disaster Coordinating
Council  said.
