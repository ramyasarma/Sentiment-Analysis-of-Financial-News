             Canada’s dollar traded little
changed against its U.S. counterpart before Bank of Canada
policy makers meet today in Ottawa, where they are forecast to
raise the benchmark interest rate.  
 “The Canadian dollar is really just treading water ahead
of the Bank of Canada,”  Blake Jespersen , director of foreign
exchange at Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital unit, said by phone
from Toronto. “It looks like they’ll move 25 basis points. It’s
their tone that’s really going to be important today.”  
 Canada’s currency traded at C$1.0563 per U.S. dollar at
8:07 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0549 yesterday. One
Canadian dollar buys 94.67 U.S. cents.  
 The central bank will raise interest rates by 25 basis
points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 0.75 percent, all 20
economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted. The announcement and
an explanation of the decision will be available on the bank’s
Web site at 9 a.m.  
 “We’re going to look for any comments related to global
growth or risks to global growth,” Jespersen said. “It’s going
to be a very balanced statement saying that rate hikes going
forward will be very dependent on the economy here and abroad.”  
 The Canadian dollar will appreciate to C$1.02 in the next
three months, Jespersen predicted.
