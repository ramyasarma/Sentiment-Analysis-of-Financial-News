             Airbus SAS  and  Boeing Co.  enter the
third day of the Farnborough Air Show today almost tied on new
orders after racking up collective contracts for 243 jetliners
with a value of more than $23 billion at list prices.  
 Boeing won 121 orders worth $11.6 billion after  Steven Udvar-Hazy ’s Air Lease Corp. bought 54 737-800 single-aisle
aircraft yesterday. Airbus has sales agreements for 122 jets
valued at $11.7 billion, excluding 50 A320s ordered by Chile’s
 LAN Airlines  and subject to confirmation.  
 Boeing’s total omits three 787 Dreamliner planes bought by
Royal Jordanian Airlines and 12 737-800 purchased by Dublin-
based Avolon Leasing Group which had already been included in
the U.S. company’s without the acquirers being disclosed.  
 Orders at this year’s Farnborough event stand at more than
three times the 78 announced at last year’s Paris Air Show, with
which the U.K. event alternates, and further commitments are
likely today. The tally trails the 373 firm orders announced by
Airbus and Boeing in Farnborough in 2008.  
 Boeing says it no longer hoards orders for air shows, and
regards the events as useful for the level of contact with other
manufacturers and airline customers.  
 Contracts from leasing companies continue to outstrip those
from airlines, with Air Lease’s 737 deal taking its order total
to 105 single-aisle models, including 51 A320s. The lessor also
has options for six more 737s.  
 General Electric Co. ’s GECAS unit has bought 100 planes, 60
of them Airbus narrow-bodies and the other 40 737s.  
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s leasing unit is also set
to buy planes, two people familiar with the negotiations say.  
 Embraer Success  
 Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA , the world’s fourth-
largest planemaker, also won orders for 50 regional jets
yesterday worth almost $1.9 billion at list prices, trumping
larger competitor  Bombardier Inc.   
 Flybe, Britain’s biggest domestic airline, added 35 88-seat
Embraer 175 planes worth $1.3 billion, while Air Lease said it
would buy 15 larger E190 jets valued at $600 million.  
 Including contracts announced yesterday, Embraer has won 55
orders at the Farnborough show, compared with 9 for Bombardier,
which failed to unveil a new buyer for its CSeries jet at the
event after a deal with Qatar Airways Ltd. hit a snag on issues
concerning engine maker Pratt & Whitney.
