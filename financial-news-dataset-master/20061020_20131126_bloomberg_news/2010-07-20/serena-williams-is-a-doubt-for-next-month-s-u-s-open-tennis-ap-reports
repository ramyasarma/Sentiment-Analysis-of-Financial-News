             Serena Williams , the world’s No. 1
ranked women’s tennis player, may miss next month’s U.S. Open
championship because of a right foot injury, the Associated
Press said, citing WTA Tour spokesman Andrew Walker.  
 Williams, 28, was injured shortly after her win at
Wimbledon when she cut her foot on a broken glass while at a
restaurant. She required surgery and the WTA Tour said two days
ago she will miss events in Istanbul, Cincinnati and Montreal.  
 The U.S. Open, the final major championship of the season,
is scheduled to begin Aug. 30 in Flushing Meadows, New York.
Three of Williams’s 13 major titles came at the tournament.  
 Williams last year was fined a record $82,500 for her
outburst at a lineswoman during her semifinal loss to eventual
champion  Kim Clijsters .
