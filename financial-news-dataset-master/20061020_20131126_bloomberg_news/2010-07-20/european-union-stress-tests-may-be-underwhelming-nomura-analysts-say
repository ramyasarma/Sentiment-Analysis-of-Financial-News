             European stress tests are likely to
be “underwhelming” because they may require banks to raise
less than half the 75 billion euros ($97 billion) of fresh
capital needed, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts.  
 National Bank of Greece SA, Piraeus Bank SA, Banco Popolare
SC, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Societe Generale SA and Deutsche
Postbank AG are among 16 banks that would have a capital
shortfall under Nomura’s own stress tests, analysts led by  Jon Peace  said in a report today. Under the European Union tests,
only about 10 banks are likely to be required to raise about 30
billion euros of fresh capital, the analysts said.  
 “There’s a clear danger of the stress tests in Europe
being a little underwhelming,” said analyst  Jon Peace . This may
“act as a catalyst for profit-taking in the sector,” he added.  
 The 54-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services
Index has declined 3.7 percent in the past month.  
 Regulators are examining the financial strength of 91 banks
to determine if they can survive potential losses on sovereign-
bond holdings. Lenders may be required to maintain a Tier 1
capital ratio of at least 6 percent under the tests. Firms that
fail to meet the standard will be required to raise extra
capital, a person briefed on the talks said yesterday.  
 EU regulators are counting on the tests to reassure
investors about the health of the region’s banks as the debt
crisis pummels the bonds of Greece, Spain and Portugal. The
results are slated to be released on July 23.
