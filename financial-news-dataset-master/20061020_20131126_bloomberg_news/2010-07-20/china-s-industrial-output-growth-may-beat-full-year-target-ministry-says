             China’s industrial output growth
this year may exceed the nation’s 11 percent target, the
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a
statement distributed before a briefing in Beijing today.  
 The nation’s industrial output growth may slow in the
second half due to higher year earlier values, the ministry
said.
