             The cost of insuring against losses
on European corporate bonds fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 4.5
basis points to 536.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 7:30
a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and a decline signals
improvement in perceptions of credit quality.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1 basis point to 119.75, JPMorgan
prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from default was
unchanged, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks
and insurers holding at 144 basis points.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
