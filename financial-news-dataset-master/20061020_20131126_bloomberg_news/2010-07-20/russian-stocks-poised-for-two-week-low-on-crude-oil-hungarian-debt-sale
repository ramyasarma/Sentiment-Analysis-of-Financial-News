             Russian stocks dropped for the
fourth time in five days as oil fell and Hungary raised less
than planned in a debt sale, reigniting concern European
governments may face financing difficulties.  
 OAO Rosneft , Russia’s largest oil producer, lost 1 percent.
 OAO Severstal , the nation’s largest steelmaker, declined 1.8,
helping to push the 30-stock  Micex Index  0.6 percent lower to
1,328.71 at the close of trading in Moscow.  
 Crude, Russia’s chief export, fell as much as 89 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $75.65 a barrel in New York. Stocks in Russia
erased earlier gains of as much as 1 percent after Hungary
raised less than it targeted in a government debt sale. Stocks
in Russia have fallen 13 percent since their April 15 peak on
fears the global recovery is slowing.  
 “Hungary is the only reason event-wise for the downward
turn,” said  Gregory Klumov , chief investment officer at Everest
Asset Management in Moscow, said by phone.
