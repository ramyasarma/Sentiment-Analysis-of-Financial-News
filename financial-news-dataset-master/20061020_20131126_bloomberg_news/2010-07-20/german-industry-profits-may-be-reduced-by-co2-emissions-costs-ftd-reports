             Germany’s energy intensive
industries may have their profits cut by as much as 87 percent
by 2020 due to the costs of carbon emissions certificates, the
 Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing a report from
Goetzpartners Corporate Finance Ltd.  
 Carbon emissions may cost German companies more than 5
billion euros if the law and emissions levels stay unchanged,
according to the report’s conservative estimates,the newspaper
said.  
 By 2020 steel producers’ profit could be at 13 percent of
current levels, refineries’ profits at 41 percent and the cement
industry profits at 62 percent, the FTD said.
