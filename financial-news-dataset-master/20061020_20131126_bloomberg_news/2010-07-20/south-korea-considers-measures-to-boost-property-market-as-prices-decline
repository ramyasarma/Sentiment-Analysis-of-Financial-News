             South Korea’s government is
considering steps to boost the country’s property market after
house prices fell for three consecutive months through June.  
 The package of measures may not be announced on July 22 as
previously expected because ministers have yet to agree on
whether to loosen borrowing rules, Kim Hee Jung, a spokesperson
for President  Lee Myung Bak ’s office, said in a statement today.  
 House prices in Seoul fell 0.1 percent in April, 0.2
percent in May and 0.3 percent in June, according to data from
Kookmin Bank, the nation’s largest lender.  
 South Korea tightened restrictions on mortgage lending last
year to slow loan growth. Banks can extend as much as 50 percent
of a borrower’s annual income for purchases of homes in Seoul
and 60 percent for areas outside the capital.  
 The prospective measures to boost house prices are under
discussion even after South Korea this month raised interest
rates to curb economy-wide inflationary pressures.
