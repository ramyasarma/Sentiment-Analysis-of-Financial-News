             Raw-sugar prices fell from a three-
month high on signs of higher production in Brazil, the world’s
largest grower.  
 Output in Brazil’s Center South, where about 90 percent of
the country’s sugar is produced, jumped 37 percent in the second
half of June, according to Unica, an industry association. Sugar
has slumped 36 percent this year as farmers collect bigger crops
in Brazil and India, the second-biggest grower.  
 “The Unica numbers continue to show robust production,
which might have cooled the market,”  Michael McDougall , a
senior vice president at Newedge USA, a broker in New York, said
in a report.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery dropped 0.33 cent, or 1.9
percent, to 17.28 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since July 9.
Yesterday, the price reached 17.7 cents, the highest level since
April 15.  
 Exports from Brazil probably will rise to a record this
month, Unica said yesterday.  
 In London, refined-sugar futures for October delivery
climbed $4.30, or 0.8 percent, to $538.30 a metric ton on the
Liffe exchange.
