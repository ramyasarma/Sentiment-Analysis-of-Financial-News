             Whirlpool Corp. , the world’s largest
appliance maker, raised its profit forecast and said it expects
record earnings this year, boosted by cost cuts and sales in
Latin America and Asia.  
 Earnings will be as much as $9.50 a share this year, up
from a previous forecast of as much as $8.50, the Benton Harbor,
Michigan-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected earnings of $8.86, the average of  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  
 Whirlpool, led by Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Fettig , said
in 2008 it would fire 5,000 workers through 2010 to reduce costs
as the U.S. housing slowdown and rising unemployment hurt demand
for refrigerators and dishwashers. In the second quarter, sales
rose 43 percent in Asia and 24 percent in Latin America.  
 “We expect to deliver a record year of earnings per share
in this fragile global economic environment,” Fettig said in
today’s statement.  
 Brian Sozzi , an analyst with Wall Street Strategies Inc.,
called the results “mixed,” saying Whirlpool didn’t increase
its forecast for unit shipments to Europe, Asia and Latin
America. Revenue and operating profit gains are slowing quarter
over quarter, New York-based Sozzi wrote in a report today.  
 Whirlpool  fell  $1.02, or 1 percent, to $90.34 at 10 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had gained
13 percent this year before today.  
 Second-quarter profit more than doubled to $205 million, or
$2.64 a share, from $78 million, or $1.04, a year earlier, the
company said. Sales rose about 6 percent to $4.53 billion,
excluding the impact of currency exchanges.  
 Excluding some items, profit was $2.82 a share. Five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated profit of $2.19, on
average.
