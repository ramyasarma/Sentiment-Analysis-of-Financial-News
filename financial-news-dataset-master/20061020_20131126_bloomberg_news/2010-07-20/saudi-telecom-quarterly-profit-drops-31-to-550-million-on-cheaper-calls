             Saudi Telecom Co., the Arab world’s
largest phone company, said profit dropped 31 percent in the
second quarter to 2.06 billion riyals ($550 million) from 2.99
billion riyals in the year-earlier period as international calls
became cheaper and charges for using outside networks increased.
The company announced the results on the Saudi bourse website
