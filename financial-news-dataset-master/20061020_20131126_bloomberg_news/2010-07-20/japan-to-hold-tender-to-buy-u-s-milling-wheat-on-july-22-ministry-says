             Japan, Asia’s biggest wheat buyer,
is seeking 142,719 metric tons of the grain from the U.S. for
flour milling in a regular tender on July 22, the  Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  said.  
 The volume sought is the largest since June 10, when the
government bought 151,000 tons. Shipment is set from Sept. 1 to
Sept. 30, Ryou Okajima at the grain trade division of the
ministry said by phone today.  
 It will be the first regular tender since June 24, as the
ministry delayed purchases until local flour millers decide how
much they will buy under the system that will replace state
stockpiling on Oct. 1.  
 The government, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales to stabilize supply, will end the state
stockpiling system, which holds 1.8 months of demand. Japanese
millers will have to boost grain inventories to at least 2.3
months, or about 70 days, in reserves from 15 days previously,
according to Shirara Shiokawa, director at the grain trade
division.  
 Under the new system, the ministry will also stop arranging
wheat deliveries to 18 ports for 96 millers across the nation,
leaving the operation to trading companies including Marubeni
Corp. and Sojitz Corp, Shiokawa said last week.  
 Japan has purchased 1.29 million tons of milling wheat this
fiscal year. In the year ended March 31, the ministry bought
4.26 million tons of the grain through regular tenders.  
 Details of this week’s tender are listed below:
