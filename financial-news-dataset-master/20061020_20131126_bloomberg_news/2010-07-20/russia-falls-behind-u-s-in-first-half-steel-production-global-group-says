             Russia fell back behind the U.S. in
terms of steel production during the first-half having overtaken
the North American nation last year during the global recession,
the World Steel Association said.  
 Russia raised steel production  22 percent  to 32.7 million
metric tons in the six months from a year earlier, while U.S.
output jumped 69 percent to 41 million tons as the world economy
recovered, World Steel said in a report on its website today.  
 China and Japan are the world’s largest steelmakers, ahead
of the U.S., which has swapped places with India, now in fifth.
Russia remains the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker.  
 World steel output rose 18 percent to 119 million tons in
June from a year earlier, World Steel said.
