             The China grain market may be
“slightly affected” by the explosion and oil spill at Dalian
port, the China National Grain & Oils Information Center said
today in an e-mailed statement. Two other ports of Jinzhou and
Bayuquan have increased shipments and have enough grain in
stores to meet demand, it said.
