             Vale SA , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, is producing the steelmaking raw material at full
capacity as China-led demand rebounds, a director said.  
 China is starting to rebuild steel stockpiles, while the
U.S. and Europe will likely increase inventories in the fourth
quarter, Claudio Alves, Vale’s director for iron-ore sales in
the Americas, said today at an event in Rio de Janeiro.  
 Global steel production rose 18 percent to 119 million
metric tons in June, the World Steel Association said today in a
report on its website. The cost of 62 percent iron ore delivered
to the Chinese port of Tianjin, which fell to a six-month low on
July 14, rose for a fourth day. It  climbed  3 percent to $121.60
a metric ton today, according to The Steel Index.  
 Vale rose 4 percent to 40.08 reais in Sao Paulo trading at
11:44 a.m. New York time. It earlier gained as much as 4.5
percent, the most since May 27.  
 Iron-ore prices will likely rebound this year,  Roger Downey , chief executive officer of  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA ,
said today at the same event. MMX, based in Rio de Janeiro, is
the iron-ore miner controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista .  
 MMX is “ramping up” production and adding capacity,
Downey said.
