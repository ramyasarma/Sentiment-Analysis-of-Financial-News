             Soybeans rose for the first time in
three sessions on increased overseas demand for supplies from
the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  
 U.S. shippers sold 115,000 metric tons to China for
delivery in the marketing year that starts on Sept. 1, the
Department of Agriculture said today in a statement. Exports for
the current year to all destinations will reach  39.7 million
tons , up 17 percent from the previous year, the USDA said last
week. The price has risen 4.6 percent in the past month.  
 “Beans are demand-driven,” said  Jon Marcus , the president
of Lakefront Futures and Options LLC in Chicago. “Beans have
stayed up, and every time the price comes off a little, it’s a
bargain, so you can see the demand is definitely there.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $9.73 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
dropping as much as 1 percent. The most-active contract has
gained 5.4 percent in the past year.  
 Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, with a 2009
value of $31.8 billion, behind corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show. The U.S. is also the world’s largest producer of
the oilseed.
