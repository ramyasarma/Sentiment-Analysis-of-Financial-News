             Wheat fell for a third straight
session after Egypt, the world’s largest buyer, shunned U.S.
supplies and bought Russian grain.  
 Egypt  today said it purchased 120,000 metric tons from
Russia. Iraq yesterday agreed to buy 350,000 tons from the U.S.,
Romania, Australia, Canada and Russia. The U.S. share was 50,000
tons, said  Larry Glenn  at Frontier Ag. Prices in Chicago still
are up 20 percent this month, touching a seven-month high last
week, on concern that a drought will shrink output in Russia.  
 “We just don’t have wheat priced right,” Glenn said from
Quinter, Kansas. “Russia’s still in business. They’re not gone.
With all the problems in the Black Sea, they’re still selling
wheat. They’re apparently not concerned about it or they
wouldn’t be peddling any.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 5.25 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $5.77 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
capping a 3.2 percent decline over three sessions.  
 Egypt bought Russian wheat for $212.45 a ton, said  Nomani Nomani , the vice chairman of the country’s General Authority for
Supply Commodities.  U.S. wheat  sold for $224.96 a ton today at
export terminals including New Orleans, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  
 The U.S. is the largest exporter of wheat, followed by
Canada, Australia and Russia, according to the USDA.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
