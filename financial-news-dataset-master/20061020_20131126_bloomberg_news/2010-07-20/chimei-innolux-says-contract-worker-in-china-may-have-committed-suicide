             Chimei Innolux Corp. , the liquid-
crystal display affiliate of Foxconn Technology Group, said a
worker at its panel-module assembly line in Foshan, southern
China, appeared to have committed suicide.  
 The man, who was not directly employed by Chimei Innolux,
was contracted through an outsourcing company, spokesman  Eddie Chen  said by phone yesterday. The worker joined the company
recently, he said without providing further details.  
 Foxconn Group, which makes  Apple Inc.  iPhones and Sony Corp.
games consoles, doubled salaries of production workers in
Shenzhen and opened its largest factory to the media after at
least 10 suicides within the group sparked criticism that it
runs a sweatshop. The last reported suicide before today’s
Foshan incident was on May 26 when a 23 year-old Foxconn Group
worker fell to his death in Shenzhen.  
 Terry Gou , founder of Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Group,
apologized in May for being unable to prevent the deaths. The
suicides were probably caused by personal problems and
exacerbated by compensation packages offered to the families of
victims, Gou said that month.  
 Chimei Innolux, based in Miaoli, northern Taiwan, became
Taiwan’s largest LCD maker through the March merger of  Chi Mei
Optoelectronics Corp ., Innolux Display Corp. and TPO Displays
Corp. The company, which supplies panels and partially assembled
screens for use in TVs, computer monitors and electronics
products, had 24,197 workers as of March 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.
