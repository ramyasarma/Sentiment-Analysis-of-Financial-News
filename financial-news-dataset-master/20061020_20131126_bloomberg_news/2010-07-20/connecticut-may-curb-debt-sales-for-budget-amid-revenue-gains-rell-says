             Connecticut , the state with the most
tax-supported debt per person, may lower the amount of bonds it
will sell to balance its budget because tax revenue is
rebounding, Governor  Jodi Rell  said.  
 The state may sell $702.8 million of bonds backed by
electric-bill surcharges to cover a projected shortfall in the
fiscal year that began July 1, down from a previous estimate of
$956 million, Rell said today in a statement. The Republican
governor cited “marked improvements” in sales-tax collections
as well lower expenditures, including a $100 million payment to
the state employee retirement system that was deferred.  
 Last year, state lawmakers opted to borrow almost $1
billion to balance the budget. The state also drained its $1.4
billion rainy-day fund and raised the top income-tax rate to 6.5
percent from 5 percent for couples earning more than $1 million
annually.  
 Connecticut’s net tax-supported debt of $4,859 per person
is the highest of all 50 U.S. states, according to Moody’s
Investors Service. The state is also the wealthiest, with per
capita personal income of $54,397 in 2009, according to U.S.
Commerce Department data.
