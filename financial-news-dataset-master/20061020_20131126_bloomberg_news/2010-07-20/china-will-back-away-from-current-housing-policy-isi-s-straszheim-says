             China will “back away” from its
tightening policies in the housing market within three months as
the economy faces a bigger risk from a slowdown than inflation,
according to International Strategy & Investment Group.  
 “The policy launched in April has totally demoralized both
home buyers and developers with no promise of lasting
benefits,” Donald Straszheim, senior managing director for
China research at ISI, wrote in a note to clients. “We expect
Beijing to quietly relax their lending restrictions and to
launch a variety of supply-side initiatives to increase the
amount of housing for low-and middle-income homebuyers.”
