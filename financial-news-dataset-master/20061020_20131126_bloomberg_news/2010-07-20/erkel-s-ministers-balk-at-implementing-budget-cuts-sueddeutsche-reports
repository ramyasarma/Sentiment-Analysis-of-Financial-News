             Ministers from German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet are balking at implementing parts of a
81.6 billion-euro ($106 billion) budget-savings program amid
signs the measures may hurt industry, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported.  
 Economy Minister  Rainer Bruederle  and Transport Minister
 Peter Ramsauer  are among those trying to backtrack on cuts
affecting their portfolios, angering Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , the newspaper said, citing Schaeuble.  
 Bruederle, a member of Merkel’s Free Democratic Party
coalition partner, opposes savings including scrapping
reductions to an environmental tax paid by some power users such
as the aluminum industry, the newspaper said. Unveiled last
month to underpin the euro’s stability, the program of budget
savings and revenue-raising measures will run from 2011 to 2014.
