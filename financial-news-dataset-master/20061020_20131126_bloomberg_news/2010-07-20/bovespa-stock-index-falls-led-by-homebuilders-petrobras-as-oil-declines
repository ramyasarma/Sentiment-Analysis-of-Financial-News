             Brazil’s Bovespa stock index fell,
led by homebuilders and Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as oil prices
declined.  
 Petrobras headed for the lowest price in two weeks as crude
retreated. Homebuilder MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA slid
1.7 percent after Credit Suisse Group AG cut the stock to
“neutral” from “outperform,” citing its valuation.  
 The Bovespa index lost 0.4 percent to 63,034.95 at 9:11
a.m. New York time. Fifty stocks fell on the index while 13
gained. The measure rose the most in a week yesterday on
speculation companies will report second-quarter profit growth
and as rising commodities prices boosted producers. The real was
little changed at 1.7933 per U.S. dollar today.
