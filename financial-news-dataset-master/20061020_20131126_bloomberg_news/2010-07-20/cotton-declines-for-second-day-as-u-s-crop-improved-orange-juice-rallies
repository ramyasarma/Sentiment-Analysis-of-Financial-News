             Cotton fell to a five-month low on
improved prospects for a bigger crop in the U.S., the world’s
largest exporter. Orange-juice futures rose.  
 As of July 18, 68 percent of the U.S. cotton crop was in
good to excellent condition, compared with 45 percent a year
earlier, the Department of Agriculture said after the close of
trading yesterday. Temperatures in the U.S. were as much as 8
degrees Fahrenheit above average for the week ended July 19,
 High Plains Regional Climate Center  data show.  
 “The crop-progress report yesterday showed that cotton
likes the heat,” said  Tom Mikulski , a senior market strategist
at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.  
 Cotton for December delivery fell 0.61 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 73.01 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching 72.96 cents, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since Feb. 10. The price has dropped 16 percent from a
two-year high on April 26.  
 U.S. farmers will harvest 18.3 million bales this year, up
50 percent from a two-decade low of 12.2 million in 2009 and 9.6
percent more than forecast in June, the USDA said July 9.  
 A rally in the  dollar  also eroded the appeal of some
commodities as an alternative to the U.S. currency. Coffee,
sugar and cocoa declined.  
 “The dollar is up fairly strong today, so we’re seeing a
lot of other soft commodities fall as well,” Mikulski said.  
 In another ICE market, orange-juice futures for September
delivery rose 0.6 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $1.4185 a pound in
New York, the third straight gain.
