             Sasol Ltd. , the biggest maker of
motor fuel from coal, will end its sponsorship of South Africa’s
World Cup winning rugby team at the end of 2010 after failing to
agree on renewal terms with the sport’s governing body.  
 The six-year deal valued at 150 million rand ($20 million)
will end Sasol’s backing of South Africa’s national rugby team,
known as the Springboks, as well as the country’s sevens rugby
team and its so-called ‘A’ and under-20 sides, according to an
e-mailed statement from the fuel producer today.  
 “We’re very proud of our association with the Springboks
and had certainly hoped our significantly increased offer would
have found traction with the union,” Sasol’s Senior Group
Executive, Lean Strauss, said in the statement.  
 “We didn’t meet on the valuation so that’s essentially
where it broke down,” South African Rugby Union spokesman  Andy Colquhoun  said by mobile phone.  
 SARU, as the governing body is known, will now start
looking for a new sponsor for the 2011 season and will make an
announcement “in due course,” it said in a separate statement.  
 During Sasol’s sponsorship of South African rugby, which
replaced previous sponsor  SABMiller Plc  in November 2004, the
Springboks won the 2006 Rugby World Cup, the 2009 Tri-Nations
against Australia and New Zealand and beat the British & Irish
Lions 2-1 during last year’s test series.  
 South Africa’s sevens team also won the  International Rugby
Board’s  2008/09 world series.
