             The U.S. House will debate
legislation to authorize trade sanctions against China for
currency manipulation as part of a package of measures to
promote U.S. manufacturing, House Majority Leader  Steny Hoyer 
said.  
 The  measure , sponsored by Representative  Tim Ryan , an Ohio
Democrat, would authorize imposition of countervailing duties on
China’s exports to the U.S. if authorities determined that the
renminbi is undervalued by at least 5 percent on average for 18
months.  
 The measure, which would amend the 1930 Tariff Act that
forbids subsidies of products imported into the U.S., would
apply to all other foreign currencies.  
 Hoyer told reporters the legislation, still in committee,
would be debated as part of a package of 18 to 20 measures
designed to promote manufacturing. Other measures include tax
credits to “expand manufacturing, job producing capacity here
in America, for working men and women,” said Hoyer, a Maryland
Democrat.  
 House leaders are still determining the amount of tax
breaks for manufacturers that would be included in the package,
he said.  
 Similar currency legislation sponsored by Democratic
Senator  Charles E. Schumer  of New York is pending in the Senate.
Schumer said last month he would move “shortly” to force a
vote on the measure.  
 China said on June 19 that it would end the peg of its
currency to the U.S. dollar. It said the next day that any
appreciation of the yuan wouldn’t be rapid.
