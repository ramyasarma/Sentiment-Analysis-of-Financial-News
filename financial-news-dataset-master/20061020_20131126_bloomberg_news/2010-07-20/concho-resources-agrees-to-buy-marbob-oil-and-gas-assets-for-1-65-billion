             Concho Resources Inc.  agreed to buy
assets of closely held Marbob Energy Corp. for $1.65 billion,
the largest acquisition in its history, expanding its oil and
natural-gas holdings in the Permian Basin of New Mexico.  
 The purchase, to be made with cash and stock, includes
assets with proved reserves estimated at the equivalent of 76
million barrels of oil, Midland, Texas-based Concho said today
in a statement. Marbob’s assets produced the equivalent of
14,000 barrels of oil a day in the first quarter and include
about 2,300 drilling locations for development,  Concho  said.  
 The purchase comes eight months after Concho announced it
would spend $225 million to buy wells and acreage in the Permian
Basin, where the company is accelerating drilling. With the
Marbob deal and existing holdings,  Concho  said it will have
100,000 net acres in the Bone Springs area of the basin.  
 “The company has a history of acquisitions and they’ve
done a good job creating value from these,” said  Scott Hanold ,
an energy analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Minneapolis who
rates Concho “sector perform.” “This will give them a lot
more running room and should be viewed positively by the
market.”  
 Concho rose $4, or 7.5 percent, to $57.29 as of the 4 p.m.
close of New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The  company 
has jumped almost fivefold in market value since selling shares
to the public in 2007.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Concho, and Vinson &
Elkins LLP represented the company in the purchase and related
financing. Concho’s board has approved the purchase, which the
company said is expected to close by Nov. 30.
