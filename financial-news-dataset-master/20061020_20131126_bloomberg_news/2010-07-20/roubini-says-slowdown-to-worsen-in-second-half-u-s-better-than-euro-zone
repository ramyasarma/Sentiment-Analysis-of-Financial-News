             Nouriel Roubini , the economist
credited with predicting the financial crisis, says the global
slowdown will worsen in the second half of this year as stimulus
measures wane and austerity programs take hold.  
 U.S. growth will slow to 1.5 percent in the second half of
2010 and into 2011, the New York University economist wrote in
the Australian Financial Review newspaper. The slowdown “will
feel like a recession,” Roubini said.  
 The outlook for the euro zone “is worse” than the U.S.
and growth may be close to zero by the end of the year, he
wrote.
