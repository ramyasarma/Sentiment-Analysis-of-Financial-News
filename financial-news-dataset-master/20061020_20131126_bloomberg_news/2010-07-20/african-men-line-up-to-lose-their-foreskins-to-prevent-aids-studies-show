             At least 100,000 men in Africa have
volunteered to be circumcised to lower their chances of catching
HIV, four years after studies showing the procedure could
prevent infections.  
 More than 90,000 men have been circumcised in Kenya since
October 2008, including 36,000 over 30 working days late last
year, researchers from the African nation said at the
 International AIDS Conference  in Vienna today. Kenya, where
about 8.5 percent of people are infected with the AIDS-causing
virus, plans to circumcise 80 percent of uncircumcised men age
15 to 49 to prevent more than 100,000 HIV infections over the
next 10 years.  
 “When it comes to circumcision, I used to be a skeptic,”
 Bill Gates , co-chairman of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
and co-founder of Microsoft Corp., said in a speech at the
conference yesterday. “I was doubtful that a large number of
men would sign up for it. I’m glad to say I was wrong. Wherever
there are clinics available, men are volunteering to be
circumcised in huge numbers, far more than I expected.”  
 Three large African studies have shown that circumcision
can lower heterosexual men’s risk of infection by the AIDS-
causing virus, HIV, by almost two-thirds.  The World Health
Organization  says that HIV-infected men shouldn’t be denied
circumcision if requested, as long as there is no medical reason
to avoid it.  
 In a separate study presented today, 14,000 men were
circumcised in less than two years in a South African township,
representing almost 40 percent of the community’s population.
That shows programs to offer the service to men in low-income
areas can be effective and safe, researchers from the French
National Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis said.  
 If male circumcision services can be expanded to 80 percent
of adult and newborn males in eastern and southern Africa by
2015, more than 4 million new HIV infections could be averted
between 2009 and 2025, according to Population Services
International, a 40-year-old health organization based in
Washington. That could also yield a total net savings of $20.2
billion during the same period.
