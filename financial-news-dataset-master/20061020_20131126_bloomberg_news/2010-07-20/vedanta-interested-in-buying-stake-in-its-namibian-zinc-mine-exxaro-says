             Vedanta Resources Plc , the metals
producer controlled by Indian billionaire  Anil Agarwal , has
expressed an interest in buying Exxaro Resources Ltd.’s Rosh
Pinah zinc mine in  Namibia , according to  Riaan Smit , Exxaro’s
commercial manager of growth projects.  
 “We’ve had talks with them, but we’re not in negotiations
with them,” said Smit, who’s in charge of Exxaro’s planned
asset sales. “It’s all informal. They haven’t visited our
mines. At this stage we’re talking to many people.”  
 Exxaro , based in Pretoria, plans to sell its zinc assets,
including the Zincor refinery in South Africa, its 50 percent
stake in Rosh Pinah, and a 26 percent stake in Black Mountain
Mining Pty Ltd., a zinc and lead miner.  
 It would be “preferable” if all the zinc assets were sold
together, Smit said by phone from Pretoria today. “We could be
in the position soon where we could entertain offers,” he said.
Smit declined to say what the stake in Rosh Pinah is valued at.  
 The zinc assets make up 2 percent of the Exxaro’s net
assets and contribute 10 percent of its annual sales, the
company said on Dec. 1.  
 Vedanta doesn’t comment on “market speculation,” a
spokesperson said by e-mail today, declining to be named in line
with company policy.
