             De La Rue Plc , the world’s biggest
printer of paper money, fell the most in 20 months in London
trading after saying production problems at one of the company’s
factories caused some operations to be suspended.  
 De la Rue dropped as much as 16 percent, the most since
November 2008. Some paper production had failed to meet quality
standards, “so production and shipping of the specification has
been suspended,” the Basingstoke, England-based company said in
a statement on the Regulatory News Service today.  
 The company, which became the preferred supplier of
banknotes to the Bank of England in 2002 and bought the state’s
printing works a year later, said paper production and sales in
2010/2011 are now set to be “materially lower than originally
planned.”  
 De La Rue dropped as much as 144 pence, and traded down 15
percent, or 136.5 pence, at 787 pence at 3:05 p.m., giving the
company a market value of 779.2 million pounds ($1.19 billion).
