             Copper prices jumped the most in
three weeks after a gain in U.S. building permits boosted demand
prospects for the metal used in electrical wiring and plumbing.  
 Permits , a gauge of future construction, rose 2.1 percent
last month to a 586,000 annual pace, the government said today.
The gain was the first since March and was more than economists
expected. Housing starts fell 5 percent from the previous month.
Builders are the biggest users of copper and use about 400
pounds (181 kilograms) in the average home.  
 “Copper is getting a bounce from the housing numbers as
people are focusing in on the permits part of the report,” said
 Matthew Zeman , a trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.
“The economic outlook is pretty mixed, so any better news is
going to help.”  
 Copper futures for September delivery rose 6.35 cents, or
2.2 percent, to $3.0015 a pound on the Comex in New York. That
marked the biggest gain for a most-active contract since June
25. The price has declined 10 percent this year on concern that
the pace of economic growth will slow.  
 The metal also climbed today as inventories fell for the
23rd straight session, the longest slump in more than a year.
 Stockpiles  monitored by the London Metal Exchange declined 0.8
percent to 419,600 metric tons today, the lowest level since
Nov. 18. Supplies have dropped 16 this percent this year.  
 ‘Exited Bear Market’  
 Increased copper consumption and limited supplies of
refined and scrap metal will support prices, Laredo, Texas-based
research company Harbor Intelligence said in a report. Usage
will outpace supplies by 125,000 tons this year with the deficit
widening to 180,000 tons in 2011, according to the report.  
 “Prices have exited the correction/bear-market phase, and
we should expect higher prices for the rest of the year and
early 2011,” Harbor Intelligence said.  
 The metal will average $3.28 this year and $3.70 in 2011,
the company said.  
 On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose $131,
or 2 percent, to $6,641 a ton ($3.01 a pound).  
 Nickel, lead, tin and zinc also advanced in London.
Aluminum was little changed.
