             Yuan forwards weakened for a fourth
day after China’s central bank set the currency’s reference rate
at a two-week low, spurring speculation it is slowing
appreciation in response to a cooling economy.  
 The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s daily rate at
6.7812 per dollar, 0.05 percent lower than yesterday’s spot rate.
Premier Wen Jiabao said during a trip to Shaanxi province that
the government should bolster exports and domestic consumption
as the global economy is recovering at a “very slow” pace,
according to a  statement  released on the State Council’s website
on July 18.  
 “If the appreciation is too fast, it will certainly hamper
a recovery,” said  Liu Xin , an analyst at the Hong Kong branch
of Bank of Communications Ltd., China’s fifth-biggest lender.
“After all, overseas sales are still important to support the
economy.”  
 Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.1 percent
to 6.6820 per dollar as of 5:47 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting
bets the currency will strengthen 1.4 percent from the spot rate
of 6.7781, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Economic growth  slowed to 10.3 percent in the second
quarter from a three-year high of 11.9 percent in the previous
three months, the government reported last week.  Industrial
production  in June rose 13.7 percent from a year earlier,
following a 16.5 percent gain in May.  
 Local Demand  
 China’s domestic demand will become the most important
driver of economic growth in the future, the commerce ministry
said at a briefing in Beijing today. In the second half of this
year, consumer spending will expand at a “relatively fast”
pace, spokesman Yao Jian said.  
 The yuan has gained 0.7 percent since the central bank
ended a two-year-old peg to the dollar on June 19.  
 Government bonds were little changed after the central bank
kept the yield on its one-year bills unchanged for a sixth
straight week.  
 The People’s Bank of China sold 45 billion yuan ($6.6
billion) of the securities at a yield of 2.0929 percent. The
amount was the most in three weeks. The seven-day  repurchase
rate , which measures funding availability between banks, slid
three basis points to 1.83 percent, a third straight decline,
according to a daily fixing rate published by the National
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 “We don’t see much room for the yields to go further
down,” said  Yang Yongguang , a fixed-income analyst with Guohai
Securities Co. in Shenzhen. “The yields have already dropped to
low levels this year as lower interbank lending costs have
bolstered demand.”  
 The yield on the 2.89 percent note due in September 2016
was traded at 2.89 percent, and the price of the security was
100.17 per 100 yuan face amount, according to the China
Interbank Bond Market.
