             VMware Inc. , a maker of software
that helps data centers run more efficiently, rose as much as
5.9 percent after its forecast topped estimates, helped by a
shift to Internet-based services.  
 Third-quarter sales will climb to $680 million to $705
million, the Palo Alto, California-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts had estimated $670.1 million on average,
according to a  Bloomberg survey .  
 VMware’s software is helping customers switch to so-called
cloud computing, which lets customers store information and
programs in data centers and access them over the Internet.
Sales are increasing across all product categories and
geographic regions, the company said.  
 “Customers continue to recognize the value that VMware
provides in modernizing infrastructures and providing a
pragmatic path to cloud computing,” CEO  Paul Maritz  said in the
statement.  
 VMware, which is majority-owned by  EMC Corp. , climbed as
much as $4.27 to $76.69 in extended trading after the report.
The  shares , up 71 percent this year, fell 93 cents to $72.42
earlier today on the New York Stock Exchange.  
 Second-quarter net income rose to $74.5 million, or 18
cents a share, from $32.5 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier.
Excluding some costs, profit was 34 cents a share, exceeding the
32 cents projected by  analysts . Sales rose 48 percent to
$673.9 million, beating the estimate of $655.1 million.
