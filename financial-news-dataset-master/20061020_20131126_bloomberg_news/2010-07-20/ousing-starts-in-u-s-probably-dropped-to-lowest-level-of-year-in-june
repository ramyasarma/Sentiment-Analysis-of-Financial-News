             Housing starts fell in June to the
lowest level of the year as a slump in sales following the
expiration of a government tax incentive caused U.S. builders to
cut back, economists said before a report today.  
 Work began  on 577,000 houses last month, down 2.7 percent
from May and the fewest since December, according to the median
estimate of 75 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 The retreat following the end of government support shows
it will be difficult for the industry that precipitated the
recession to sustain a recovery. Mounting foreclosures will
swell the supply of houses on the market and pressure prices,
while prospective buyers shy away as a lack of jobs shakes
confidence in the world’s largest economy.  
 “We’re going to see general weakness in the housing market,
at least into the fourth quarter,” said  David Sloan , a senior
economist at 4Cast Ltd. in New York. “Sales were boosted until
April by the tax credit and now we’re seeing a sharp falloff.”  
 The Commerce Department’s homebuilding figures are due at
8:30 a.m. in Washington.  Estimates  ranged from 525,000 to
620,000.  
 Housing’s inability to maintain a rebound is one reason the
economic recovery is not gaining speed.  Building permits  were
probably little changed at 575,000 from 574,000 in May, the
survey showed, signaling construction is not likely to rebound
in coming months.  
 Credit Ends  
 The projected drop in housing starts would follow a 10
percent decrease in May from April’s 18-month high. The deadline
for signing purchase agreements and becoming eligible to receive
a government tax credit worth as much as $8,000 was April 30.  
 Sales of  existing homes  fell to a 5.1 million annual rate
in June from 5.66 million the prior month, economists forecast
before a July 22 report from the National Association of
Realtors in Washington.  
 Builders have to contend with a growing  supply of existing 
homes that is driving down home values as foreclosures rise.
Home seizures jumped 38 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier, RealtyTrac Inc. said last week, putting lenders on
pace to claim more than 1 million properties this year.  
 Homebuilder sentiment  fell in July to its lowest level
since April 2009, a report yesterday from the National
Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo showed. The group’s
confidence index fell to 14 from 16 the prior month, and
readings less than 50 mean more respondents said conditions were
poor.  
 Builder Shares  
 Shares of homebuilders have underperformed the broader
stock indexes this year. The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite
Homebuilding Index has fallen 12 percent this year, compared
with a 3.9 percent decline for the S&P 500 Index.  
 Other economic data have turned down. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of  consumer
sentiment  decreased in July to the lowest level in 11 months,
the group reported last week.  
 Earlier in the month, the Labor Department reported private
payrolls rose a less-than-forecast 83,000 in June and total jobs
fell by 125,000, the first decline this year. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast unemployment will end the year at
9.5 percent, unchanged from the rate in June.  
 Lennar Corp .’s home sales were running 20 percent to 25
percent lower last month than a year earlier as the expiration
of the tax credit sapped demand, Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Miller  said June 24.  
 “The new home market and housing in general still face
serious headwinds from current economic and legislative
conditions,” Miller said on a conference call with investors.
“The prospect of additional delinquencies ahead continues to
moderate this recovery as shadow inventory continues to be
absorbed.”
