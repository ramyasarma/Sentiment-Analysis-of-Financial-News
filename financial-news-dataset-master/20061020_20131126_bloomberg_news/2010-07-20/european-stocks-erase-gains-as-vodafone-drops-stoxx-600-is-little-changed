             European stocks erased earlier
gains, as a drop in shares of Vodafone Group Plc overshadowed a
rally by basic-resources companies.  
 The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed at
246.23 at 8:59 a.m. in London, while futures on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent.
