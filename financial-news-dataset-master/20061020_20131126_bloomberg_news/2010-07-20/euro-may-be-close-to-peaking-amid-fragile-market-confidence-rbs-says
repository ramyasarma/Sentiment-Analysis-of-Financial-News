             The euro’s gains are close to
petering out amid “fragile market confidence,” Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc said.  
 “Confidence will take a hit if European economic growth
begins to fade,”  Greg Gibbs , a currency strategist in Sydney,
wrote today in a report. “It is hard to see confidence in
European debt markets improving further from here. Perhaps the
stress tests will deliver one more spurt of confidence. But it
is close to a peak and so is the euro.”  
 The euro advanced 0.6 percent to $1.3014 as of 7:16 a.m. in
London. It climbed 1 percent to 113.28 yen.
