             Glencore International AG is
unlikely to merge with  Xstrata Plc  before selling shares in an
initial public offering, Nomura Holdings Inc. said.  
 “We see a very low probability of a reverse takeover prior
to any potential IPO,” Paul Cliff, a London-based analyst at
Nomura, said today in a note.  
 Glencore, the commodities trader that already holds 34
percent of Xstrata, is studying a merger with the mining company
to gain more access to financing, two people familiar with the
matter said May 3. Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore sold bonds
in December that are convertible into shares upon an IPO.  
 “Our understanding is that senior Glencore management has
spent time visiting Xstrata shareholders,” Nomura said. “The
general reaction to any potential Xstrata-Glencore merger, at
least before a potential Glencore IPO, has been lukewarm.”  
 Any merger proposal by Glencore would need approvals from
Xstrata’s board, without the two members appointed by Glencore,
and shareholders, discounting Glencore’s stake, Nomura said.  
 “Uncertainty remains regarding the possibility of Glencore
reversing into Xstrata as an alternative to any potential IPO,”
Nomura said. “This has been a major driver in Xstrata’s recent
underperformance.”
