             Marshall & Ilsley Corp. , Wisconsin’s
largest lender, reported a second-quarter loss that was wider
than analysts expected as loan balances shrank. The shares
tumbled as much as 11 percent.  
 The  net  loss was $174 million, or 33 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $234 million, or 83 cents, in the same
period a year earlier, Marshall & Ilsley said today in a
statement. The average  estimate  of 21 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was a loss of 26 cents. The shares fell 71 cents, or
9.2 percent, to $6.99 at 1:55 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite  trading  and sold for as little as $6.85.  
 Non-interest income was $174 million, down 34 percent from
$264.8 million from the year-earlier period. Commercial loans
and leases were $12.2 million in the quarter, down 17 percent,
and lending to customers for construction plunged 35 percent.
Total loans fell 14 percent.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Mark Furlong  said the odds of the
Milwaukee-based company returning to profitability by the end of
the year are less than they were at the beginning of 2010.
“This weak economic recovery is certainly not helping the
cause,” he said on a conference call.  
 Furlong is pushing to improve credit quality after losses
tied to housing and real estate loans spurred an 86 percent
plunge in shares the past three years. The lender has posted
seven straight quarterly losses and still owes $1.72 billion to
the U.S. Treasury Department’s bailout fund.  
 Marshall & Ilsley put aside $440 million for loan losses in
the second quarter, a decrease of 29 percent from the year-
earlier period. Non-performing loans decreased for a fourth
consecutive quarter.  
 The lender’s shares rose 41 percent this year through
yesterday for the third-best performance in the 24-company  KBW
Bank Index .
