             MGIC Investment Corp.  led mortgage
insurers higher after posting its first profit in 12 quarters on
lower claims costs.  
 MGIC, the largest U.S. mortgage guarantor, rose 71 cents,
or 9.1 percent, to $8.53 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, the biggest gain since June. Radian Group
Inc. advanced 10 percent and PMI Group Inc. climbed 3.4 percent.  
 MGIC’s  second-quarter profit  of $24.6 million, or 13 cents
a share, compares with a loss of $339.8 million, or $2.74 in the
year-earlier period, the Milwaukee-based company said today in a
statement. The loss excluding the results of some investments
was 4 cents a share, beating by 74 cents the average estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “I feel good obviously about the delinquency
performance,” said MGIC Chief Executive Officer  Curt Culver  in
a conference call with investors today. “It’s outperformed our
expectations that we had at the beginning of the year. We hope
it’s not just due to seasonal factors.”  
 Mortgage insurers, which pay lenders when homeowners
default and foreclosure fails to recoup costs, have tightened
underwriting standards and raised prices to recover from losses
that began in 2007. MGIC’s stock has surged 48 percent this year
amid speculation the economic recovery and government programs
like  Home Affordable Modification Program  would ease the pace of
delinquencies.  
 The cost of claims from mortgage defaults fell by more than
half to $320.1 million from $769.6 million in the year-earlier
period. MGIC is the first of the largest U.S. mortgage insurers
to post second-quarter results.  
 ‘Stopped the Bleeding’  
 “They stopped the bleeding in terms of delinquencies,”
said  Matthew Howlett , a New York-based analyst at Macquarie
Group Ltd. “The defaulting borrowers have already left the
pool. That’s driving the numbers.”  
 MGIC’s new delinquencies dropped 24 percent to 48,181 from
63,067 in the year-earlier quarter. The number of borrowers who
became current on overdue payments climbed 29 percent to 47,290.
At the end of the second quarter, 17.6 percent of loans were
delinquent, compared with 18.4 percent on Dec. 31.  
 Delinquent inventory in the second half of the year will
decline “at a much more modest level,” Culver said.  
 American International Group Inc. ’s mortgage guarantor,
which recorded a quarterly profit for the first time since 2007
in the three months ended March 31, may continue to post
improving results as it seeks to take market share from rivals,
 Kim Garland , chief operating officer of the Greensboro, North
Carolina-based unit said June 10 in a telephone interview.  
 ‘The Right Direction’  
 AIG’s United Guaranty had $73 million in operating profit
in the first three months of this year, compared with a $483
million loss in the year-earlier period.  
 “A lot of things are pointing in the right direction for
us,” Garland said.  
 MGIC’s premium revenue fell 11 percent to $309.2 million
from $347.1 million in the same period last year on tighter
underwriting. The insurer spent $1.19 on claims and  expenses  at
its mortgage business for every dollar it collected in premiums
in the second quarter. That’s down from $2.37 in the year-
earlier period as more borrowers caught up on overdue mortgages.  
 The insurer recorded an investment gain of $31.7 million,
compared with $14.5 million in the year-earlier period. Book
value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose 6.7 percent
to $9.84 from $9.22 as of March 31, 2010.  
 Share Sale  
 MGIC in April  sold  $805 million of shares and $300 million
of notes to bolster capital. Competitors  Radian  and PMI have
also sold shares and debt this year.  
 Investors have been betting on a rebound with insurers and
banks including  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  backing new mortgage
guarantor Essent Group Ltd.  
 “The perceived increase in credit quality of loans that
are being insured today combined with the deterioration of the
financial strength ratings of the existing mortgage insurance
companies could encourage new entrants,” MGIC said in its
statement. “We understand that one potential new entrant has
advertised for employees.”
