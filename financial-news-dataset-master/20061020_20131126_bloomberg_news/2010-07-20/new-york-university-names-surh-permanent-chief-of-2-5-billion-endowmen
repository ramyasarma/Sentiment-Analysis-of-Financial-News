             New York University, the largest
private nonprofit university in the U.S., promoted  Tina Surh  to
chief investment officer of its $2.5 billion endowment.  
 Surh, 39, the acting CIO since October, has overseen the
fund since her predecessor,  Maurice Maertens , retired last year,
the Manhattan school said today in an e-mailed statement. Surh,
who joined NYU in 2005 as director of investments, was promoted
to deputy CIO in 2008.  
 Surh graduated from Tufts University in Medford,
Massachusetts, and has a master’s in business administration
from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. NYU said in
November that its fund investments fell 11 percent in the year
ended Aug. 31, compared with an 18 percent drop for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index, including dividends. The university added to
its bond investments and reduced stock holdings.  
 NYU claimed in a December 2008 lawsuit in New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan that it lost more than $24 million
after money manager J.  Ezra Merkin  and his funds invested with
fraud operator  Bernard Madoff . The university’s lawyers have the
right to legal fees for the suit, a New York State judge ruled
in March.
