             Albums by Dizzee Rascal and  Corinne Bailey Rae  are on the 12-strong shortlist for the U.K.’s 2010
 Barclaycard Mercury Prize  announced today.  
 Also on the list are CDs by Laura Marling,  Paul Weller  and
Mumford & Sons.  
 The Mercury Prize, awarded annually since 1992, is now
sponsored by Barclaycard, which has taken over from the
Nationwide Building Society. The prize has often been given to
new or non-commercial acts and pits different genres against
one another, ranging from folk and jazz to hard rock. The
winner receives 20,000 pounds ($30,370), although the boost
from album  sales  can be worth much more.  
 The award focuses on musical quality. It doesn’t take into
account album sales, media profile or live performances. The
winner will be announced on Sept. 7.  
 Among acts boosted in the past by a Mercury Prize were
rapper Dizzee Rascal (real name: Dylan Mills), who won in 2003
for “Boy in Da Corner,” and Badly Drawn Boy (a.k.a.  Damon Gough ), the 2000 winner for “The Hour of Bewilderbeast,” both
on the independent XL Recordings label. Last year’s winner was
Speech Debelle, with Elbow’s “The Seldom Seen Kid” (Fiction
Records) the year before. The Klaxons won in 2007 with “Myths
of the Near Future” (Polydor).  
 Previous hit albums that were nominated for the Mercury
Prize but failed to win include  Robbie Williams ’s “Life Thru a
Lens” in 1998, when the award went to “Bring It On” by
Gomez, and “OK Computer” by Radiohead in 1997, beaten by Roni
Size/Reprazent’s “New Forms.”
