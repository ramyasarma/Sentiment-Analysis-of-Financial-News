             Ukraine is seeking $3 billion from
its new  International Monetary Fund  loan in two installments by
the end of the year, Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said.  
 “We will receive one tranche in September and the second
one at the beginning of December,” Azarov said today in an
interview on Ukraine’s national TV channel UT-1.  
 The Washington-based IMF agreed with Ukraine on a new $14.9
billion loan after a mission from the lender approved economic
policies aimed at narrowing the budget deficit. The IMF
Executive Board may approve the loan on July 28, Deputy Prime
Minister  Serhiy Tigipko  said on July 14.
