             Cable & Wireless Worldwide Plc 
dropped as much as 17 percent in London trading after saying
full-year profit will be “around the lower end” of analysts’
estimates following U.K. government spending cuts.  
 The company, which provides telecommunications services to
customers including National Grid Plc, fell the most since March
23 after forecasting “somewhat slower growth” in earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Discretionary government spending has “slowed very
significantly,” the company said in a statement today.  
 “What has surprised us is the speed that this was put into
action,” Chief Executive Officer  Jim Marsh  said today on a
conference call with analysts. Some “fairly significant”
government spending programs have been delayed, with additional
projects suspended, he said.  
 The U.K. coalition government has sought to reduce the
country’s budget deficit to safeguard the nation’s top credit
rating. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  announced an
initial 6 billion pounds ($9.2 billion) of cost cuts on May 24.
The health department declined to renew a 240 million-pound
contract with Microsoft Corp. this week.  
 Cable & Wireless Worldwide, which separated from its parent
company in March, has yet to hold formal meetings with
government departments on its existing contracts, Marsh said
today.  
 Cable & Wireless Worldwide shares declined as much as 14.4
pence to 69.15 pence and traded at 70.7 pence as of 9:27 a.m.,
giving the company a market value of 1.86 billion pounds.
