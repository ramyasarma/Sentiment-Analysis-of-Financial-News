             North Korea executed a former 
Cabinet official who had been responsible for negotiations with
South Korea, the Seoul-based Dong-a Ilbo newspaper reported, 
citing an unidentified person in Beijing.  
 Kwon Ho Ung, North Korea’s chief delegate to 
ministerial-level talks between the two sides from 2004 to 2007
was killed by firing squad, the paper said.  
 The Ministry of People’s Security and the Ministry of State
Security, the North’s two main security arms, are rounding up 
“impure elements” to show their loyalty to Kim Jong Un, the 
heir apparent to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the newspaper
said in an editorial July 17.   
 Last week, brothers in their 20s were publicly executed in 
Hoeryong, North Hamkyong Province, the paper said without 
giving details. Former Railway Minister Kim Yong Sam was 
publicly executed in March last year after about 100 
locomotives were scrapped after workers stole and sold 
components, it said. In March this year, Pak Nam Gi, former 
finance director of the ruling North Korean Workers’ Party who 
oversaw last year’s botched currency revaluation, was also 
shot, it said.
