             Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s
biggest gold producer, rose by the maximum 10 percent limit in
Shanghai as Great Wall Securities Co. and Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities Co. said the company’s recent losses were excessive.  
 Zijin Mining gained 0.52 yuan to 5.73 yuan at the 11:30
a.m. local break, the most since October 2009. The shares had
plunged 10 percent before today in the week since the company
announced acid-laced water had leaked from its largest mine,
polluting the Ting River and poisoning enough fish to feed
72,000 residents for a year.  
 “Because of the pollution scandal, Zijin’s price is
relatively low compared to other gold mining companies,” Geng
Nuo, analyst at Great Wall, said in a phone interview. At
Shenyin & Wanguo, analyst Peggy Ye said the gains weren’t
unusual. “It’s a bounce from the bottom,” she said.  
 Zijin Mining today expressed “deep regret” for the leak of
and a nine-day delay in admitting to the breach and losses
caused to fish farmers.
