             Franck Ribery , a member of the
French national soccer team, was charged with having sex with an
underage prostitute today after being held for questioning by
police, Agence France-Presse said, citing his lawyer.  
 Ribery’s brother was also charged in Paris, AFP said.
Ribery’s lawyer, Sophie Bottai, said he didn’t know the
prostitute wasn’t 18, the legal age for prostitution in France,
AFP said.  
 Bottai and the Paris prosecutor’s office didn’t immediately
return calls by Bloomberg News for comment.
