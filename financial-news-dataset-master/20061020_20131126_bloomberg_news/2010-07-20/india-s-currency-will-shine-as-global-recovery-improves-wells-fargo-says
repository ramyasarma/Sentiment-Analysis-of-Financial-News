             India’s rupee will strengthen in the
next 18 months as the global economy stabilizes and the Asian
nation’s growth continues, according to Wells Fargo & Co.  
 “Once global investor sentiment becomes more stable,
India’s robust growth profile and rising interest rates should
attract foreign capital flows, putting upward pressure on the
currency,”  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at Wells
Fargo in New York, wrote in a research note yesterday.  
 The rupee will strengthen to 43 per dollar in 18 months,
Serebriakov wrote. The currency, which was at 47.36 yesterday,
has weakened 1.8 percent against the dollar this year.  
 The currency has declined this year because of “broader
financial market instability” stemming from the European
sovereign-debt crisis, Serebriakov wrote. The fall contrasts
with the pace of India’s recovery, he wrote. The nation’s
economy grew 8.6 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier, and the Reserve Bank of India has increased interest
rates three times this year, he wrote.  
 “The Indian fundamentals will sort of shine through once
global conditions improve,” Serebriakov said in a telephone
interview. “That’s when the rupee will move up.”
