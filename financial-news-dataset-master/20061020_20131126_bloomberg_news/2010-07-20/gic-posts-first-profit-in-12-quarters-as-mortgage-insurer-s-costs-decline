             MGIC Investment Corp. , the largest
U.S. mortgage insurer, posted its first profit in 12 quarters as
claims costs fell on a decline in delinquencies in home loans.  
 The  second-quarter profit  of $24.6 million, or 13 cents a
share, compares with a loss of $339.8 million, or $2.74 in the
year-earlier period, the Milwaukee-based company said today in a
statement. The loss excluding the results of some investments
was 4 cents a share, beating by 74 cents the average estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “They stopped the bleeding in terms of delinquencies,”
said  Matthew Howlett , a New York-based analyst at Macquarie
Group Ltd. “The defaulting borrowers have already left the
pool. That’s driving the numbers.”  
 Mortgage insurers, which pay lenders when homeowners
default and foreclosure fails to recoup costs, have tightened
underwriting standards and raised prices to recover from losses
that began in 2007. MGIC’s stock has surged 35 percent this year
through yesterday amid speculation the economic recovery and
government programs like  Home Affordable Modification Program 
would ease the pace of delinquencies.  
 MGIC gained 3 cents to $7.85 at 9:36 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, making it the only company to
advance in the 24-stock KBW Insurance Index. The cost of claims
from mortgage defaults fell by more than half to $320.1 million
from $769.6 million in the year-earlier period.  
 MGIC’s new delinquencies dropped 24 percent to 48,181 from
63,067 in the year-earlier quarter. The number of borrowers who
became current on overdue payments climbed 29 percent to 47,290.
At the end of the second quarter, 17.6 percent of loans were
delinquent, compared with 18.4 percent on December 31.  
 Premium Revenue  
 Premium revenue fell 11 percent to $309.2 million from
$347.1 million in the same period last year on tighter
underwriting.  
 The insurer recorded an investment gain of $31.7 million,
compared with $14.5 million in the year-earlier period. Book
value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose 6.7 percent
to $9.84 from $9.22 as of March 31, 2010.  
 MGIC spent $1.19 on claims and  expenses  at its mortgage
business for every dollar it collected in premiums in the second
quarter. That’s down from $2.37 in the year earlier period as
more borrowers caught up on overdue mortgages.  
 Industrywide, borrowers caught up on overdue mortgages
faster than new delinquencies were reported on insured home
loans in February for the first time in almost four years as the
U.S. economy improved, a trend that continued in March, April
and May.  
 The  ratio of cures  to defaults on guaranteed loans was 1.08
in May compared with .60 a year earlier, according to data from
the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.  
 Share Sale  
 MGIC in April  sold  $805 million of shares and $300 million
of notes to bolster capital. Competitors  Radian Group Inc.  and
 PMI Group Inc.  have also sold shares and debt this year.  
 Stricter standards have left fewer new policyholders to
supplement the riskier policies sold in prior years that are
still on the books. The industry sold $81.8 billion of coverage
last year, a 67 percent decline from 2008, according to data
compiled by  Inside Mortgage Finance , a trade publication.  
 Until 2007, private mortgage policies had been among the
most profitable types of coverage sold by insurers. From 2004 to
2006, members of the  Mortgage Insurance Companies of America 
reported a profit margin of at least 35 cents for every dollar
they collected in premiums. Auto insurers made less than 5 cents
on every dollar in 2006, according to A.M. Best Co.
