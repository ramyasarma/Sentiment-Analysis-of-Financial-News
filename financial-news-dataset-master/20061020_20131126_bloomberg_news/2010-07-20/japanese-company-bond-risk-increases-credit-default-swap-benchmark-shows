             The cost of protecting Japanese
corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 3 basis points from
its July 16 close to 133 basis points as of 8:36 a.m. in
Tokyo, the highest since July 7, Morgan Stanley and CMA prices
show. Markets in Japan were closed yesterday for a holiday.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 131
basis points as of 9:46 a.m. in Sydney, according to Nomura
Holdings Inc. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-
grade borrowers outside Japan was also little changed at 132
basis points as of 7:49 a.m. in Singapore, Credit Agricole CIB
prices show.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of credit quality and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
