             China’s stocks rose for a second day
as automakers rallied on improved earnings and the prospect the
government may relax its tightening policies as the economy
slows.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.4 percent to 2,484.13
at 9:46 a.m. local time. China’s stocks also advanced after the
Securities Journal reported the government may allow qualified
institutional investors to use as much as 10 percent of approved
investment quotas to trade stock-index futures.
