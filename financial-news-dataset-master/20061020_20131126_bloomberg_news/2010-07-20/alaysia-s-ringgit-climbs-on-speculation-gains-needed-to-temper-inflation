             Malaysia’s ringgit advanced, halting
a three-day slide, on speculation the central bank will allow
the currency to appreciate to help contain inflation.  
 The currency climbed from a two-week low before a
government report tomorrow that may show  consumer prices  rose
last month by the most in more than a year, according to a
Bloomberg survey. Bank Negara Malaysia may have finished raising
interest rates this year following three increases since March,
CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. and Barclays Capital Plc said earlier
this month.  
 “The market believes the ringgit can still strengthen by
year-end with inflation picking up a bit,” said  Azmi Shukri Rahman , a foreign-exchange trader at CIMB in Kuala Lumpur. “It
seems well supported following recent dips.”  
 The ringgit appreciated 0.2 percent to 3.2230 per dollar as
of 9:58 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 3.2325 yesterday, the lowest level since
July 5 and is up 6.2 percent this year, Asia’s best performance.
The currency may trade between 3.2150 and 3.2350 today, Azmi
said.  
 Malaysia’s inflation rate accelerated to  1.7 percent  in
June, according to the median forecast in the survey, the
fastest pace since May 2009.  
 The central bank lifted its  overnight policy rate  by a
quarter-percentage point to 2.75 percent on July 8. The
benchmark was at a record low 2 percent in March. Policy makers
will hold their last two meetings of this year on Sept. 2 and
Nov. 12.
