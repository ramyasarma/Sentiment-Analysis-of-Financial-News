             France’s CAC 40 Index slipped 45.24,
or 1.3 percent, to 3,441.09 at 12:11 p.m. in Paris, its fifth
day of declines. The SBF 120 Index slid 1.2 percent.  
 The following is a list of companies whose stocks either
rose or fell in the French capital. Symbols are in parentheses.  
 Alstom SA  (ALO FP) slid 71.5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
36.14 euros. The world’s third-largest power-equipment maker
said orders in the April to June period slumped 36 percent as
utilities continued to delay building new power plants.  
 Cap Gemini SA  (CAP FP), Europe’s largest computer services
company, dropped 1.30 euros, or 3.6 percent, to 34.49 euros and
chipmaker  STMicroelectronics NV  (STM FP) lost 2.6 percent to
6.44 euros. European technology companies retreated after
International Business Machines Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc.
both reported sales that missed analysts’ estimates.  
 Edenred  (EDEN FP) climbed 61 cents, or 4.6 percent, to
13.91 euros. The voucher and services unit of hotelier  Accor SA 
said first-half revenue rose 3.8 percent to 461 million euros
($596 million), helped by its business in South America.  
 Hermes International SCA  (RMS FP) gained 2.50 euros, or 2.2
percent, to 117.30 euros as the maker of luxury handbags and
silk ties raised its 2010 revenue forecast after second-quarter
sales rose faster than analysts’ estimates on demand in Asia.  
 Full-year revenue may grow as much as 12 percent compared
with its previous forecast of at least 5 percent.  
 Wendel  (MF FP) dropped 1.57 euros, or 3.7 percent, to 41.12
euros after the private-equity firm had its long-term corporate
credit rating cut one level to BB- by Standard & Poor’s. The
rating firm cited Wendel’s “continually high” leverage.
