             French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
won’t accept changes to his plan to raise the retirement age or
balance the pension system’s accounts by 2018, Labor Minister
 Eric Woerth  said as parliament starts debate on the measure.  
 The government is open to changes to better protect workers
in hardship jobs, Woerth, who is Sarkozy’s point man on the
proposal, said in an interview on Europe1 radio.  
 “It can’t be amended on its essentials,” Woerth said.
“But we can work on solutions for arduous jobs.’  
 The bill would increase the retirement age to 62 from 60,
while maintaining retirement at 60 for people who started work
particularly young, or whose strenuous jobs can’t be carried out
by people in their 60s. The bill calls for such cases to be
determined on an individual basis, while unions want whole
categories of jobs to be eligible for early retirement.  
 The opposition Socialist Party will propose 150 amendments,
Marisol Touraine, a Socialist lawmaker, said in an interview
with Les Echos. The opposition wants to keep the retirement age
at 60 and plug gaps in the system’s accounts through new taxes.  
 Sarkozy said last week he expects parliamentary approval by
the end of October.
