             The yen fell against the dollar on
the euro on speculation its recent advance was excessive and
will lead to growing calls for some type of intervention.  
 Japan’s currency dropped at 87.01 per dollar as of 10:11
a.m. in Tokyo from 86.69 in New York yesterday. The yen weakened
to 112.61 per euro from 112.19.
