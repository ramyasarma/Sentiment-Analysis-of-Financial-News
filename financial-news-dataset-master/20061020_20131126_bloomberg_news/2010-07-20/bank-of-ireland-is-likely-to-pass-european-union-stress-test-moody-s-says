             Bank of Ireland Plc , the country’s
biggest lender by market value, will probably pass European
banking stress tests after raising 2.93 billion euros ($3.8
billion) of capital in June,  Moody’s Investors Service  said.  
 “We’d be very surprised” if Bank of Ireland was told to
find extra cash, London-based Moody’s analyst  Ross Abercromby 
said in a telephone interview.  
 Bank of Ireland and rival  Allied Irish Banks Plc  are among
91 European banks undergoing stress tests to show whether they
can withstand a shrinking economy and drop in the value of
government bonds. Ireland’s financial regulator told the two
banks to raise a combined 10 billion euros by the end of
December, following a stress test of domestic lenders in March.  
 While Allied Irish may be asked to increase capital levels,
that should be covered by the company’s plan to raise 7.4
billion euros by the end of year, Abercromby said.  
 “We wouldn’t be surprised if AIB was required to raise
capital,” he said. “But the difference for AIB, compared to
many European peers, is that the bank has already been through
the domestic regulator’s stress test and has been told to raise
7.4 billion euros.”  
 Abercromby said the Irish regulator’s capital test on
banks, the so-called  Prudential Capital Assessment Review ,
“looked to be somewhat stronger” than the Committee of
European Banking Supervisors’ tests.
