             Aabar Investments PJSC , an Abu Dhabi
government-controlled company, said the offer period for shares
owned by minority stakeholders starts today and trading will
cease Aug. 5 in a step to take the business private.  
 Abu Dhabi-owned International Petroleum Investment Co.,
seeking to de-list Aabar from the local bourse, aims to complete
the purchase of the shares tendered in the sale on Aug. 10.
Trading will resume after Aug. 9 until all Aabar stock is
delisted, the company said in a  statement  to the exchange today.  
 IPIC agreed this week to raise its offer price to 1.95
dirhams a share, valuing Aabar at 7.88 billion dirhams ($2.15
billion), from 1.45 dirhams a share after the stock market
regulator ordered the increase.  
 Aabar will hold an extraordinary general meeting for
shareholders to approve the cancellation of the stock exchange
listing on Aug. 15, the company said in a  notice  published
today. Shareholders who have accepted the offer should place
their shares for sale through the Abu Dhabi exchange’s trading
platform, Aabar said in the statement today.
