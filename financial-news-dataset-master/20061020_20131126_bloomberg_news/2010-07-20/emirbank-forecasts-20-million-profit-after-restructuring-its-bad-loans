             Temirbank, a state-controlled Kazakh
lender, plans to post as much as 3 billion tenge ($20 million)
of profit this year by restructuring its bad loans.  
 Temirbank expects to earn 2 billion tenge to 3 billion
tenge from the restructuring, Chief Executive Officer  Erzhan Shaikenov  told reporters in Almaty today. The company has
reduced its debt to 167.9 billion tenge from 283.4 billion tenge
in the reorganization, it said in a statement today.  
 The state last year took control of BTA Bank, the parent of
Temirbank at the time, and the company subsequently defaulted,
along with three other Kazakh lenders. The four banks are
seeking to restructure a total of more than $20 billion of debt.  
 Temirbank plans to cut non-performing loans to 5 percent of
its total portfolio in 2012, the company said. The loan book
dropped to 252.7 billion tenge as of June 1 from 279.8 billion
tenge a year earlier, according to the Agency for Financial
Supervision’s website.  
 The state-owned National Wellbeing Fund, Samruk-Kazyna,
now holds about 80 percent of Temirbank, while international
creditors own 20 percent, the lender said. The Specialized
Financial Court in Almaty ruled yesterday that Temirbank’s
restructuring has been completed, Shaikenov said.
