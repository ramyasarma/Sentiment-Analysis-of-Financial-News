             The U.K. pound rebounded against the
euro as Hungary’s smaller-than-expected debt auction weighed on
the single European currency.  
 Sterling also resumed its ascent against the dollar and
government bonds pared their gains as the U.K.’s benchmark stock
index recovered, limiting its daily descent. The pound had lost
as much as 0.5 percent against the greenback earlier as reports
showed a wider-than-estimated budget deficit and lower mortgage
approvals. Five-year gilts fell after a sale of 3.75 billion
pounds ($5.7 billion) of 2016 bonds attracted reduced demand.  
 “The focus is very much with the euro-dollar dynamics,”
said  Henrik Gullberg , a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG
in London. “Most currencies outside of the euro have held up
well today. Euro-sterling is very much driven by what happens in
euro-dollar and I think that’s what we’ve seen.”  
 The pound appreciated 0.5 percent to 84.59 pence per euro
at 5:05 p.m. in London after weakening to 85.32 pence earlier.
It breached 85 pence yesterday for the first time since May 31.
Sterling was up 0.2 percent to $1.5226. The currency reached
$1.5472 last week, the highest since April.  
 The 16-nation euro fell against 14 of its 15 most-actively
traded peers. Hungary’s short-term borrowing costs rose to a 19-
week high at its first debt sale since international creditors
suspended talks, weakening the forint and stoking concern that
interest rates may increase.  
 Britain’s currency has rebounded 3 percent against the
dollar since June 22, when Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  outlined spending cuts to help tame the budget
shortfall. Concern that the government will struggle to plug the
deficit has still driven sterling down 5.5 percent versus its
U.S. counterpart this year.  
 U.K. Reports  
 A quarterly business confidence gauge dropped to 10 from 24
at the last report in April, the Confederation of British
Industry said today. The median estimate of three economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a decline to 22.  
 “Some of the shine has come off sterling,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge fund sales at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. in London. “It seems clear that the Bank of England
will stay where it is. It won’t be chasing rates higher.”  
 The June budget shortfall of 14.5 billion pounds compares
with 14.7 billion pounds a year earlier, the Office for National
Statistics said today. That surpassed the 13 billion-pound
median forecast of 17 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “Although disappointing on the month, that is drastically
better than the situation in mid-2009 when borrowing was
increasing by 10 billion pounds compared with the same month a
year earlier,”  Alan Clarke , an economist at BNP Paribas SA in
London, wrote in a client note.  
 Gilt Yield Rises  
 The yield on the two-year  gilt  increased one basis point to
0.79 percent while that on the 10-year security was one basis
point lower, at 3.35 percent. The yield on the 2.75 percent
security maturing in January 2015 rose two basis points to 2.08
percent. The 10-year yield fell as much as three basis points
earlier.  
 The U.K.’s sale of 4 percent securities maturing 2016
attracted bids equivalent 1.38 times the amount on offer, down
from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 1.7 times at an auction
on July 21, 2009, the debt office data showed.  
 The FTSE 100 Index closed down 0.2 percent after earlier
sliding as much as 1.1 percent.
