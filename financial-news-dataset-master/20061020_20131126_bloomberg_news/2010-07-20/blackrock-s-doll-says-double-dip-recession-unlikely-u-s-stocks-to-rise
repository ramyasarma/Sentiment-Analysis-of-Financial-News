             A “double-dip” recession is
unlikely, even as corporate earnings and economic reports raise
fresh concerns over the strength of a global recovery, said
 Robert Doll , of BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset
manager.  
 U.S. stocks have the potential to climb higher in the
second half of this year, Doll, BlackRock’s vice chairman, said
in a Bloomberg Television interview. Futures on the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  dropped as much as 0.5 percent today after a
report showed U.S. home-builder confidence fell more than
forecast, fueling concern the recovery is faltering.  
 “My view is that we will not have a double dip, and that
we’ll work our way higher, but maybe not just yet,” Doll said.
“If we can get through the second quarter with earnings
reasonably good, revenues reasonably good versus expectations,
that will be a good down-payment on getting out of what ails us
in this period.” Earnings have been “okay, but not great,” he
said.  
 The  S&P 500  index rallied 23 percent in 2009 as governments
worldwide mounted stimulus programs to counter a global
recession. This year, it has lost 3.9 percent as European budget
deficits and China’s steps to curb asset bubbles looked like
threatening a recovery.  
 U.S. Reports  
 Speculation of a double-dip recession intensified this
month as reports pointed to a contraction in U.S. manufacturing
and slowing economic growth in China, and after companies from
Google Inc. to General Electric Co. and Citigroup Inc. reported
earnings or revenue that missed analysts’ estimates.  
 “If this is just an ordinary cyclical slowdown, which is
my view, stocks will have a better second half,” Doll said.
Even as China’s growth slows, the world’s most populous nation
will continue to spur a global recovery and drive up stock
markets, particularly in developing nations, he said.  
 “China is a potent force of growth,” said Doll. “We do
think they have the muscle to help continue the emerging markets
being the leader of the world’s growth scene.”  
 BlackRock is “overweight” U.S. stocks within its developed
markets portfolio because of the “significant stimulus”
ploughed into the economy over the past two years, Doll said.  
 “We’re overweight, but not as much as before, the emerging
markets,” he said. “Our preference is to play them through the
multinationals.”  
 In January, BlackRock predicted the S&P 500 may end the
year at 1,250, which is almost 17 percent above yesterday’s
closing level.
