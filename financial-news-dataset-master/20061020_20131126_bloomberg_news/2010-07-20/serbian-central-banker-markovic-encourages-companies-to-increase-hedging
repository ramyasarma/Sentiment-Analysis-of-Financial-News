             Serbia’s central bank wants
financial institutions and businesses to increase their use of
foreign-exchange hedging as a floating dinar is used to keep
inflation in check, Vice-Governor  Bojan Markovic  said.  
 The dinar has lost almost 38 percent against the euro since
the global financial crisis started in October 2008, curbing
imports as goods from abroad became more expensive, Markovic
told a business forum in Belgrade today.  
 Exchange-rate fluctuations “are inevitable” as the bank
targets inflation and “will stay in the foreseeable future,”
he said. “By promoting the use of hedging instruments, the
central bank is hoping to contribute to a situation when
businesses and households are no longer scared of exchange-rate
fluctuations.”  
 Serbia’s economy is on the mend after the crisis hit
exports and consumer demand. The economy shrank 3 percent in
2009 and the International Monetary Fund has forecast growth of
1.5 percent for this year and 3 percent in 2011.  
 The share of forward transactions in interbank trading is
“still very low” at below 5 percent, “less than the needs of
our economy for that kind of protection,” Markovic said.  
 Interbank trading peaked at 23.67 billion euros ($30.5
million), or two-thirds of Serbia’s gross domestic product in
2008. In 2009, it fell to slightly more than 7 billion euros due
to the global crisis and stood at 3.68 billion euros in the
first five months of 2010, according to the central bank.  
 Exports rose by 20.4 percent in the first five months of
2010 to $3.59 billion, while imports rose four percent to $6.42
billion.
