             Citigroup Inc.  hired  Rob Biro  from
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  to lead global oil trading in Singapore,
the first U.S. bank to base a worldwide trading head in the city,
according to two people with knowledge of the appointment.  
 Biro, 42, will take up the post in September, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the move hasn’t
been made public. He was formerly at Goldman Sachs’s unit J.
Aron & Co. in Singapore as vice-president for middle distillates.  
 Adam Abdur Rahman , a spokesman for Citigroup in Singapore,
referred requests for comment by telephone and e-mail yesterday
to spokeswoman Patricia Choo, who declined to comment by phone
today.  
 Banks and trading houses including Standard Chartered Ltd.,
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Societe Generale SA,
Mercuria Energy Ltd., Noble Group Ltd. and Trafigura Beheer BV
are hiring energy traders in Asia amid rising demand in the
region for coal, oil and natural gas.  
 Singapore, which is the Asian hub for oil trading, is
offering tax breaks and incentives to lure companies to boost
their trading desks to the city-state.
