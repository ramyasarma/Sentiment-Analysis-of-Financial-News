             Crude oil may fall below $70 a
barrel in New York, reversing two months of gains, unless the
market can post a “strong day” to kick off a rally, according
to  Cameron Hanover Inc.   
 Oil hasn’t posted gains or losses of more than 1 percent in
the past week as swings in equities fanned concern that the
market can't sustain its gains. Prices face technical
resistance at the 200-day moving average above $77 a barrel,
based on a chart from the energy adviser in New Canaan,
Connecticut.  
 “We are just one strong day away from looking bullish
again,”  Peter Beutel , Cameron Hanover’s president, said in a
note. “Of course, another sharply lower day would
force us to believe we might be headed back toward $69.50.”  
 Oil, which rose to a 19-month high of $87.15 a barrel on
May 3, has fallen more than 3 percent this year amid speculation
the global economic recovery may stall and curb fuel demand. The
contract for delivery in September, the most widely traded month,
was at $77.26 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 36 cents,
at 11:35 a.m. Singapore time.  
 Futures surged 2.9 percent on July 13 as  U.S. equities 
rallied, before posting a weekly loss of 8 cents as prices fell
in the following three days.  
 “It had looked like prices were on their way to test
$79.40,” according to Beutel. “It looks less like that now.
Prices are still in a trading range between $69.50 and $79.40.”  
 Oil earlier this month crossed above the 50-day moving
average, used to indicate resistance, signaling possible gains.
The next hurdle is at the 200-day mean before the 100-day
average above $78 a barrel, Cameron Hanover’s chart shows.
“Sell stops,” or downside support, start from $75.25 a barrel.
Crude last settled below $70 on May 25.  
 “This market had a lot thrown at it, in terms of economic
bad news,” Beutel said. “Based on the news out last week,
prices should have dropped much more than they did.”
