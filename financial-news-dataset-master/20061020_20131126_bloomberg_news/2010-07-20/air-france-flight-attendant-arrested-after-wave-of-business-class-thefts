             French police arrested an  Air France 
flight attendant after a series of thefts of cash, jewelry and
credit cards from sleeping business-class passengers.  
 The arrested woman, who hasn’t been publically identified,
was questioned and released under court supervision on July 17,
said a spokeswoman for the prosecutor in the northern Paris
suburb of Bobigny, who declined to be named, citing department
policy.  
 The arrest caps a six-month investigation opened after five
passengers on a Tokyo-Paris flight reported that a total of
4,000 euros ($5,160) had been stolen from their hand luggage.  
 Thefts have been reported in business-class sections of 142
Air France flights this year, according to French newspaper  Le
Figaro , which first reported the arrest. The suspect faces
charges related to 26 separate incidents.  
 French border police used staff rosters and passenger lists
to identify the suspect, Figaro said. Officers arrested her on
the tarmac of Paris Charles de Gaulle airport on July 16, after
she arrived on a flight from Tokyo.  
 Police searching the flight attendant’s home and a bank
deposit box in her name recovered jewelry, checks and credit
card numbers, Le Figaro said.  
 Air France had no comment on the arrest, company spokesman
 Nicolas Petteau  said by telephone. Under international aviation
rules, the  airline  accepts liability for baggage only when
placed in the hold.
