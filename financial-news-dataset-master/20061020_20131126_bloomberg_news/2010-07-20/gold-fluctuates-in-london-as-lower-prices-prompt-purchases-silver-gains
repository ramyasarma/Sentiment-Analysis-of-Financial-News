             Gold declined to an eight-week low
in New York on speculation investor demand for the metal as a
protection of wealth will dampen.  
 The metal is trading 7 percent below a record set last
month. The dollar was 0.6 percent higher against the euro before
stress-test results this week from European banks. The U.S.
currency earlier slipped to the lowest level since May 10.  
 “Gold’s safe-haven appeal has started evaporating
following a strong rebound in the euro,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London, said today in a report.
“Unless we see a renewed flight for safety, it is unlikely that
gold would retest the June highs anytime soon.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery lost as much as $5.70, or
0.5 percent, to $1,176.20 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the
lowest price since May 21. They traded at $1,177.70 at 8:05 a.m.
local time. Gold for immediate delivery in London was 0.4
percent lower at $1,177.90.  
 Bullion was little changed at $1,181.50 an ounce in the
morning “fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to
sell output, from $1,181 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 European regulators are examining the strength of 91 banks
to determine whether they can survive potential losses on
sovereign-debt holdings. Results will be released July 23.
Spanish officials including Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said
last week they’re confident about the results of the stress
tests on Spanish banks.  
 Ireland Rating Cut  
 Gold gained with the dollar in the previous three quarters
as the euro slumped 16 percent in the period against the
greenback. Bullion futures, which typically move inversely to
the U.S. currency, climbed to a record $1,266.50 on June 21 as
investors sought to protect their wealth against the debt crisis
in Greece and other European nations struggling to repay debt,
and on concern that the global recovery may slow.  
 Moody’s Investors Service cut Ireland’s credit ranking one
level to Aa2 yesterday, citing a “significant loss of financial
strength” and the cost of bank bailouts.  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, were unchanged for a second day at
1,314.21 metric tons yesterday, according to the company’s
website. Global holdings of the metal by ETFs rose 1.6 tons to a
record 2,078.1 tons yesterday, according to  Bloomberg data  from
10 providers.  
 When prices fell below $1,190 on July 16 “the buying
response from the traditional physical hubs was quite
significant and volumes to India were the sixth largest our
sales desk in Switzerland experienced so far this year,” UBS AG
analyst  Edel Tully  said today in a report. “Physical buyers are
prepared to buy gold on a day when the metal experiences a large
intraday negative swing.”  
 Silver Slides  
 Russia’s central bank added 200,000 ounces to its gold
reserves last month, increasing its stockpile to 22.8 million
ounces (709.2 tons), it said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 Silver for September delivery in New York fell 0.3 percent
to $17.49 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery declined 1
percent to $1,498 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery
dropped 1.7 percent to $436.50 an ounce.
