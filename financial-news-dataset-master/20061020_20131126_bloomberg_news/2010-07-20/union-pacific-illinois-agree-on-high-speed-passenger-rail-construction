             Union Pacific Corp. , the biggest
U.S. railroad, and the state of Illinois agreed to begin
construction in September of the first U.S. high-speed passenger
rail route created with economic-stimulus money.  
 The company was among freight railroads operating in the
U.S. that balked at May guidance from the U.S. Federal Railroad
Administration that spelled out relationships between them and
operators of high-speed passenger service on their tracks.  
 “Today’s announcement will create hundreds of jobs and is
a major step towards making high-speed rail a reality in
Illinois,” Governor  Pat Quinn , a Democrat, said today in an e-
mailed statement. “When the corridor is completed, travelers
will be able to move from Chicago to St. Louis in under four
hours.”  
 The Chicago-St. Louis route received $1.1 billion from last
year’s $787 billion economic-stimulus package to help create
faster passenger rail service. Illinois is the home state of
President  Barack Obama  and U.S. Transportation Secretary  Ray LaHood .  
 Union Pacific Chief Executive Officer  James Young  said the
May U.S. guidance led the Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad to
“basically stop” the project on the Chicago-St. Louis line.
Since then, Young and other railroad executives met with LaHood
about their concerns.
