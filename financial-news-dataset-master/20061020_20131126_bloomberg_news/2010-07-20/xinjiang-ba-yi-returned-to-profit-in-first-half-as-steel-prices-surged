             Xinjiang Ba Yi Iron & Steel Co., a
Chinese steelmaker controlled by Baosteel Group Corp., said it
may post a profit of 320 million yuan in the first half of the
year, compared with a loss of 182 million yuan a year ago.
Profit improved due to higher steel prices and increased
marketing, the company said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock
Exchange today.
