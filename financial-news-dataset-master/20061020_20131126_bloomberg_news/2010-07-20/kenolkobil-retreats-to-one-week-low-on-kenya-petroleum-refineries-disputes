             KenolKobil Ltd. , a Kenyan fuel
retailer, fell to the lowest level in a week after saying Kenya
Petroleum Refineries Ltd. is holding more than 4 billion
shillings ($49 million) of refined fuel belonging to it.  
 KenolKobil, which has operations in seven African
countries, retreated 3 shillings, or 2.8 percent, to 10.3
shillings as at 10:48 a.m. in the capital, Nairobi. That’s the
weakest intraday price since July 12.  
 The refinery has also locked out two ships holding a total
of 45,000 metric tons of refined petroleum and jet fuel,  David Ohana , the general manager of KenolKobil’s Kenyan unit, told
reporters in Nairobi yesterday.  
 KenolKobil, which has 25 percent market share in the East
African nation, has incurred more than 240 million shillings in
demurrage costs, a term used when the charterer pays the
shipowner for extra use of the vessel. One ship has been at sea
for more than two months, while the other has been out for about
a month, Ohana said.
