             Nestle SA , the world’s largest food
company, said it appointed the head of its Argentine division to
 run  the Brazilian  dairy unit , which operates the company’s
biggest milk operation.  
 Pablo Devoto, 51, is expected to take over his new position
in October, the company’s Brazilian press office said today in
an e-mailed response to questions. Devoto, who in the 1980s
played for Argentina’s national rugby team known as the Pumas,
is replacing Ivan Galinovic, who will move to Chile.  
 Devoto, who worked for Nestle since 1987, was commercial
manager in the Central American division from 1993 to 1998,
 according  to information on Nestle’s website. He subsequently
was in charge of marketing for Argentina before he became the
president of the unit in 2002.
