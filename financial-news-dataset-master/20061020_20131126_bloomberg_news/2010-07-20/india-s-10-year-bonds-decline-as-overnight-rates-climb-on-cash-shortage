             India’s benchmark 10-year  bonds 
declined on concern reduced  cash at banks  will push overnight
rates higher, curbing demand for debt.  
 Yields rose on speculation the central bank will raise
 interest rates  for a second time this month after the nation’s
top statistician said  inflation  will accelerate in July due to
higher fuel prices. The interbank  call money rate  is at 5.70
percent today, above the 5.5 percent rate at which the Reserve
Bank of India lends to banks, indicating tight cash conditions.  
 “Expectations that the liquidity will improve in early
July have been belied and the cost of funding has gone up,”
said S. Srikumar, a fixed-income trader at state-owned
Corporation Bank in Mumbai. “Inflation is also causing concern
to investors.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due in May 2020 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.63 percent as of
9:46 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The price fell 0.04, or 4 paise per 100 rupee face
amount, to 101.16.  
 Banks borrowed an  average  500.4 billion rupees ($10.6
billion) a day from the central bank through its repurchase-
auction window since June 1. In May, the  Reserve Bank of India 
drained a daily average of 328 billion rupees from lenders.  
 Wholesale prices rose 10.55 percent in June, a fifth month
in which gains exceeded 10 percent. A decision by the government
on June 25 to scrap subsidies on gasoline and increase diesel
prices may add 1 percentage point to inflation, according to
estimates by the central bank.  
 “The inflation number in July will be higher than in June,
in large measure because of what has happened to fuel prices,”
said T.C.A. Anant, the government’s top statistician.  
 The central bank’s next policy meeting is scheduled for
July 27.
