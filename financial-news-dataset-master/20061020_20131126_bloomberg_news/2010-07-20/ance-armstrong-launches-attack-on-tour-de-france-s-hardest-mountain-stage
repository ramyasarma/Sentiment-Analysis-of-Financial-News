             Lance Armstrong  missed out on a Tour
de France stage win today after being outsprinted at the end of
the three-week race’s toughest day, which included four Pyrenean
mountain climbs.  
 The seven-time champion finished sixth of eight riders in
the dash to the finish in Pau, after helping drive the pace of
the breakaway group for about five hours.  Pierrick Fedrigo  won
the stage, the 16th of 20, while  Alberto Contador  kept an eight-
second lead in the overall standings.  
 “It was full gas all day,” Armstrong, who hasn’t taken a
stage this year, told reporters. “I’m not the best guy in the
race but I still have the spirit of a fighter.”  
 Armstrong, 38, said last month that this will be his last
Tour de France. He discounted his chances of an eighth title a
week into the July 3-25 race after being held back by several
crashes and a tire puncture.  
 He moved up six places to 25th overall after today’s 124-
mile stage, 33 minutes, 46 seconds behind Contador.  
 In 1969, Belgium’s  Eddy Merckx  won a Tour de France stage
over the same four climbs of Peyresourde, Aspin, Tourmalet and
Aubisque with an 87-mile solo ride.  
 Armstrong was cheered on by fans lining the course as he
took turns to lead the breakaway group today.  
 “The entire Tour the fans have been really nice to me,”
he said. “I appreciate their support.”  
 Contador Jeered Again  
 Defending champion Contador was jeered by some fans for a
second straight day when he pulled on the yellow jersey in a
podium ceremony. Yesterday he profited when previous leader Andy
Schleck’s bike chain sprang off on the Port de Bales climb.
Cyclists sometimes stop when a rival has a mechanical problem or
crashes.  
 Neither Contador nor Schleck sought to gain time on each
other today in a stage that finished with a flat stretch after
the descent from the Aubisque mountain pass.  
 Schleck, who yesterday said his “stomach is full of
anger” at Contador’s move, embraced him today while he was
being interviewed by France 2 television.  
 “They are things that happen in the race,” Schleck said.
“I thank you, my friend,” Contador replied.  
 Tomorrow is a rest day before a final Pyrenean stage the
following day. There are also two more flat stages and a time
trial, with the race finishing on July 25 in Paris.
