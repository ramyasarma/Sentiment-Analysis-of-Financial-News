             German two-year note futures may
fall as low as 108.81 should they pass a key support level, UBS
AG said, citing technical indicators.  
 The contract expiring in September, known as the euro-
schatz future, is “ vulnerable while they trade below
109.34,”wrote  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical
strategy at UBS in London. “As long as this remains the case
the expectation is for limited upside and further selling
pressure. A break below yesterday’s 109.105 low will be the next
negative development, exposing the market over the coming days
down to 108.81, the May 10 low trade and rally point.”  
 The September bund contract was little changed at 109.145
as of 8:35 a.m. in London.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.
