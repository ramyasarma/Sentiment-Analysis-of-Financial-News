             The Latvian Treasury’s reserves,
worth about 10 percent of gross domestic product, are a
“positive signal” for investors, said Jevgenija Jalovecka,
director of the treasury’s financial planning department.  
 The reserves, equal to about $2.4 billion, are big enough
to boost confidence in the country’s solvency, she said in an
interview with  Latvijas Radio  today.  
 Latvia turned to a group led by the European Commission and
the International Monetary Fund for a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.8
billion) loan at the end of 2008. The debt-to-GDP ratio has
reached almost 40 percent, she said, and borrowing costs from
the international loan have remained low.
