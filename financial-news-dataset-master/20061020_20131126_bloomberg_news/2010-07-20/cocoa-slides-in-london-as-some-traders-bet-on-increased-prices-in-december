             Cocoa prices fell to a two-month low
in London as some speculators sold the September contract to buy
futures for later delivery on bets excessive rains will curb
output in Ivory Coast, the world’s largest producer.  
 Cocoa for September delivery slid 1.1 percent on the Liffe
exchange as December futures rose 0.5 percent. Contracts for
delivery in 2011 also gained. Ivorian farmers start harvesting
in October.  
 “It looks to me like some people in the speculative camp
rolled some length out of September and into December,” said
 Eric Sivry , the head of cocoa brokerage at ABN Amro Markets
(U.K.) Ltd. in London.  
 September cocoa fell 26 pounds to 2,319 pounds ($3,545) a
metric ton. Beans for delivery in December added 10 pounds to
2,193 pounds a ton. The September contract expires Sept. 15.  
 Black pod disease has developed in parts of Ivory Coast
after weeks of heavy rainfall, causing some growers to cut down
trees, according to farmers and the state-owned Fund for
Developing and Promoting Coffee and Cocoa Activities.  
 “The rain is getting to the stage where it could be a
concern,” said  Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.
in London. “We need some of the intensity to start to weaken
and more sun.”  
 Cocoa has gained 28 percent in the past year, partly on
forecasts for higher demand.  
 On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, cocoa for September
delivery slipped $4, or 0.1 percent, to $2,977 a ton, declining
for the second straight day.  
 Robusta-coffee futures for September delivery fell $46, or
2.7 percent, to $1,684 a ton in London. Arabica-coffee futures
for September delivery dropped 5.25 cents, or 3.2 percent, to
$1.5855 a pound on ICE, the biggest loss for a most-active
contract since July 6.
