             The koruna is a “clear buy” and
“the bright spot” of Europe, the Middle East and Africa as the
new Czech government plans to adopt austerity measures to narrow
its budget deficit,  Danske Bank A/S  said.  
 With a “fair value” around 20 per euro, the currency has
a “significant long-term potential,” Copenhagen-based analysts
at Danske Bank wrote in a report to clients today.  
 The koruna, the world’s second-best performer in the past
month after the Swiss franc, was little changed today at 25.378
per euro at 4:35 p.m. in Prague. Yesterday, the currency gained
0.2 percent even as the forint weakened by 2.9 percent and the
zloty declined 0.6 percent after Hungary failed to gain
international lenders’ approval for its budget plan.  
 The Czech currency has been “nearly untouched by the
Hungarian turmoil yesterday,” the analysts said. “That to us
is a real sign of strength. The newly elected Czech government
is going ahead with significant reforms, which is clearly long-
term supportive for koruna.”  
 Prime Minister  Petr Necas ’s government, named on July 13,
has pledged to cut its deficit to within the European Union
limit of 3 percent of economic output by 2013 from the 2010
target of 5.3 percent. Meeting the goals could put “upward
pressure” on the country’s A1 rating, Moody’s Investors Service
analyst  Dietmar Hornung  said in an interview with Bloomberg News
published yesterday.
