             Sugar loading at Brazil’s largest
port resumed this weekend after a week of rain halted shipments
and prompted a record backlog of vessels.  
 Eight vessels are being loaded with sugar, the  Port of
Santos , the country’s largest, said in an e-mail statement
today.  
 Ports in Brazil, which ships more than half of the world’s
sugar exports, have struggled to keep up with demand to
transport the sweetener as mills process a record cane crop.  
 The South American country’s six main sugar ports had a
record 111 vessels delayed today, waiting to load 3.56 million
metric tons of sugar, according to  Santos Associados Consultoria
Ltda.  and Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos Ltda shipping agency.
The backlog rose from 103 ships a week ago.  
 Brazil sugar exports in July will likely surpass a
September 2009 record of 2.55 million tons, industry association
Unica said yesterday, citing technical director  Antonio de Padua .  
 Dry weather is expected at least until July 26, the Port of
Santos said on its website.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery fell 1.9 percent, or 0.33
cents a pound, to close at 17.28 cents at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York.
