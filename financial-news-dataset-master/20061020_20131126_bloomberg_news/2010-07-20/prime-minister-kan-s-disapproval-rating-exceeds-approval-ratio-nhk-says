             Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s
disapproval rating exceeded his approval ranking for the first
time since he became leader in June, national broadcaster NHK
Television, said citing its own survey.  
 The government had an approval rating of 39 percent, while
45 percent of those who responded disapproved of his
performance,  NHK  said. The Japanese broadcaster carried out its
survey between July 17 and 19, targeting 1,708 people. The
broadcaster said it received replies from 1,104 people.  
 Most of those who disapproved of Kan told NHK they
disagreed with his policies, while 20 percent of those who don’t
approve of the government said it doesn’t have the ability to
implement its policies, the report said.  
 Kan’s Democratic Party of Japan lost its majority in the
upper house in elections earlier this month.
