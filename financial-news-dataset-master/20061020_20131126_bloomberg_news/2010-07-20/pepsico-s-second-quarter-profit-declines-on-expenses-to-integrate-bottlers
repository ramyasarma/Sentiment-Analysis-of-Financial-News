             PepsiCo Inc. , the world’s largest
snack-food maker, posted a 3.4 percent drop in second-quarter
profit on costs to integrate its largest bottlers.  
 Net income fell to $1.6 billion, or 98 cents a share,
PepsiCo said today in a statement. That included $155 million in
expenses tied to the bottler purchases. The acquisitions helped
push total sales up 40 percent to $14.8 billion, beating the
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The  bottlers  give PepsiCo, led by Chief Executive Officer
 Indra Nooyi , more control over the distribution of most of its
drinks, such as Mountain Dew and Gatorade. The North American
beverage business sales more than doubled last quarter,
accounting for about one-third of total revenue.  
 “It’s still early, but we saw some signs that the bottler
acquisitions make sense,”  Jack Russo , an analyst at Edward
Jones & Co. in St. Louis, said today in an interview. “And that
there’s going to be a return on the money they spent.” He
 recommends  buying PepsiCo shares.  
 PepsiCo increased $2.68, or 4.3 percent, to $64.73 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The gain was
the biggest since Aug. 4, 2009. PepsiCo shares have gained 6.5
percent this year, compared with a 6.6 percent drop for Coca-
Cola Co. and a 2.8 percent decline for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  
 Revenue from the Frito-Lay business in North America, which
makes snacks such as Cheetos and Doritos chips, advanced 1.8
percent. Sales from the Quaker Foods line in North America fell
4.3 percent  last quarter  as consumers bought less cereal.

 “There’s no doubt we would have liked stronger performance
from this iconic health and wellness brand,” Chief Financial
Officer  Hugh Johnston  said of Quaker on a conference call today.
“The fact is we’ve underinvested in this brand.”  
 PepsiCo  will spend more to innovate and improve quality,
starting this year with the texture of its oatmeal, Johnston
said. The revamp will include salt and sugar reductions and a
new multigrain version.  
 PepsiCo reiterated its  forecast  for an 11 percent to 13
percent increase in 2010 earnings, excluding some items and the
impact of currency fluctuations. That would mean earnings of
$4.12 to $4.19, compared with the $4.16 average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Excluding some items, second-quarter profit rose to $1.10 a
share, PepsiCo said. That compared with the $1.08 average of
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 A year earlier, second-quarter  profit  at Purchase, New
York-based PepsiCo was $1.66 billion, or $1.06 a share. Coca-
Cola, the world’s largest soft-drink maker, is scheduled to
report second-quarter earnings tomorrow.
