             The dollar may drop to an eight-
month low against the yen as a slowing U.S. economy pushes down
returns, spurring Japanese investors to avoid the greenback,
said BNP Paribas SA, France’s biggest bank by assets.  
 Treasury two-year  yields  were within two basis points of a
record low before a government report that economists said will
show U.S. housing starts fell in June to the lowest level this
year. Japan in May  pulled money  out of the Treasury market at
the fastest pace in two years, government data show.  
 “Over the past month, most of the major U.S. data releases
have disappointed,” analysts including  Hans-Guenter Redeker ,
head of global currency strategy in London at BNP Paribas, wrote
in a report yesterday. Lower yields are “likely deterring the
traditional foreign investors (especially Japan) for the time
being, suggesting dollar-yen will remain under pressure,” they
wrote.  
 The dollar traded at 87 yen at 6:52 a.m. in London, after
dropping as low as 86.27 on July 16. It has declined 7.3 percent
since April 30.  
 BNP Paribas said the dollar may drop to as low as 84.95,
near the weakest since November 2009. It touched 84.83 yen on
Nov. 27, the least since 1995.  
 ‘Deflation’ Risks  
 A slowing U.S. economy may damp foreign demand for
Treasuries by helping to hold down yields that dropped earlier
this year as the European debt crisis prompted investors to buy
U.S. government securities as a safe haven.  
 Work began on 577,000 U.S. houses last month, down 2.7
percent from May, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before the Commerce Department
reports the figure.  
 Confidence among U.S. consumers tumbled in July to the
lowest level in a year, a report showed July 16, “supporting
the view that the U.S. may be headed for deflation,” the
analysts wrote.  
 The two-year note yielded 0.59 percent, versus the all-time
low of 0.5765 percent set on each of the last two trading days.  
 Japan lowered its Treasury holdings by $8.8 billion in May
to $786.7 billion, the U.S. Treasury Department reported in
Washington on July 16.  
 China , the biggest foreign investor in Treasuries, also
lowered its holdings by $32.5 billion in May to $867.7 billion.
Chinese purchases of U.S. Treasuries were at their lowest level
since February 2009.  
 “The move to a more ‘flexible’ currency regime in China in
June” may mean that the Asian nation has less need to
accumulate U.S. dollar assets, the BNP Paribas analysts wrote.
