             French Labor Minister  Eric Woerth 
denied that he helped his wife get a job as a financial adviser
to the nation’s richest woman and said he wouldn’t resign.  
 “I never asked that my wife be hired,” Woerth said in an
interview today on Europe 1 radio. “She has her own
professional life, and I never have asked anyone to hire her in
her 25-year career. I have no intention to resign.”  
 Florence Woerth worked as a financial adviser to  L’Oreal SA 
heiress  Liliane Bettencourt  before stepping down from the job
last month amid a probe by authorities into possible tax
evasion. In an interview with Europe 1 on June 23, she said she
was unaware of any tax irregularities.  
 French daily Le Monde  reported  last week that Patrick de
Maistre, Bettencourt’s chief financial adviser, told police he
hired Florence Woerth after Eric Woerth, who was then budget
minister, asked him to meet her and give her advice on her
career.
