             Raw-sugar prices retreated from a
three-month high as a rally in the dollar eroded the appeal of
some commodities as a hedge against inflation.  
 The  greenback  jumped the most in six weeks against a basket
of six major currencies. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19
raw materials fell as much as 0.5 percent, heading for a third
straight drop. Sugar has slumped 35 percent this year as farmers
collect bigger crops in Brazil and India, the largest producers.  
 “A stronger dollar is weighing on the market,” said
 George Kopp , a senior market analyst at International Futures
Group in Chicago. “A bumper crop out of Brazil” also helped
drive down prices, he said.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery dropped 0.16 cent, or 0.9
percent, to 17.45 cents a pound at 9:28 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Yesterday, the price reached 17.7 cents, the
highest level since April 15.  
 Output in Brazil’s Center South, where about 90 percent of
the country’s sugar is produced, jumped 37 percent in the second
half of June, according to Unica, an industry association. This
month, exports from the South American country will likely reach
a record, Unica said yesterday, citing technical director
 Antonio de Padua .  
 In London, refined-sugar futures for October delivery added
40 cents to $534.40 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange.
