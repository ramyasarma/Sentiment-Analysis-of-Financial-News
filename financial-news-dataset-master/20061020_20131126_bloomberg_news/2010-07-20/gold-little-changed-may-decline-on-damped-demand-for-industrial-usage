             Gold prices, little changed, may
drop for a fifth session as concerns that the global economic
recovery may be slowing damped demand for the metal used in
industrial goods as well as jewelry.  
 Ireland’s credit rating was downgraded yesterday by Moody’s
Investors Service, which cited a “significant loss of financial
strength” and the cost of bank bailouts. The precious metal has
dropped 6.5 percent from a record $1,265.30 an ounce on June 21.
The euro has fallen 9.5 percent versus the dollar this year on
concern that widening budget deficit in countries including
Ireland, Spain and Greece could lead to a default.  
 “IBM results were not good, the euro is weak and Ireland’s
rating was downgraded,” said  Hwang Il Doo , a senior trader at
Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul. “Almost half of all
gold is for industrial use and recent industry-related data
point to a possible slowdown in the economic recovery.”  
 Gold for immediate delivery was little changed at $1,183.6
an ounce at 2:01 p.m. Seoul time. The price touched $1,177.47
yesterday, the lowest level for a most-active contract since May
24. Futures for August delivery were little changed at $1,183.20
on the Comex in New York.  
 International Business Machines Corp., the world’s biggest
computer-services company, reported yesterday revenue last
quarter that missed analysts’ estimates and a drop in services-
contract signings.  
 ‘Safe Asset’  
 “The merit of gold as a safe asset seems to be waning a
bit recently. We still have to wait and see,” said C.H. Oh,
head of overseas futures at NH Investment & Futures in Seoul.  
 Gold holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, were unchanged at 1,314.21 metric
tons as of July 19, according to figures on its website.  
 U.S. housing starts fell 2.7 percent to a 577,000 annual
rate in June, according to the median estimate of economists in
a Bloomberg News survey before Commerce Department data today.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators trimmed
their  net-long positions , or bets on a rally in Comex gold
futures, by 2 percent to 204,921 contracts in the week ended
July 13, according to government data. That marked the lowest
level since April 6.  
 Immediate-delivery silver gained 0.5 percent to $17.6800 an
ounce. Platinum was 0.1 percent lower at $1,511.25 an ounce,
while palladium climbed 0.6 percent to $447.25 an ounce.
