             Gold futures rebounded from the
lowest price in eight weeks on demand for a haven from weakening
currencies.  
 The euro fell as much as 0.8 percent on renewed debt
concerns in Europe. Gold surged to a record $1,266.50 on June 21
and also reached all-time highs last month in euros, U.K. pounds
and Swiss francs. Earlier today, the metal touched $1,175.10 an
ounce, the lowest level since May 21.  
 “It’s a good time to buy gold while it’s on sale,” said
 Matt Zeman , a trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “For
buy-and-hold types of people, fiscal irresponsibility is too
widespread to completely trust fiat currencies.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery rose $9.80, or 0.8
percent, to $1,191.70 on the Comex in New York, the biggest gain
for a most-active contract since July 13. The metal has gained
8.7 percent this year.  
 European regulators are examining 91 banks to determine
whether they can survive potential losses on sovereign-debt
holdings. Results will be released July 23.  
 “Investors are nibbling at the long side of gold,” said
 Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a
broker in Chicago. “There’s a small degree of uncertainty
heading into the bank-stress test.”  
 Jewelry Sales Increase  
 Sales at the  House of Kahn Estate Jewelers  in Chicago were
up 30 percent in June from a year earlier as customers viewed
gold and precious stones as more likely to retain value, Tobina
Kahn, a vice president, said in an interview last month.  
 Kathleen Markiewicz, a customer at the store, said that she
has been buying one piece of jewelry a month and selling
investments in mutual funds.  
 “To me, it is a safer investment,” Markiewicz said.  
 Moody’s Investors Service cut Ireland’s credit rating one
level to Aa2 yesterday, citing a “significant loss of financial
strength” and the cost of bank bailouts.  
 Russia’s central bank added 200,000 ounces of gold to its
reserves last month, increasing the stockpile to 22.8 million
ounces (709.2 metric tons), the bank said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Silver futures for September delivery rose 15 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $17.693 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery rose $4.70, or 0.3
percent, to $1,517.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery climbed $7.15, or
1.6 percent, to $451.05 an ounce.
