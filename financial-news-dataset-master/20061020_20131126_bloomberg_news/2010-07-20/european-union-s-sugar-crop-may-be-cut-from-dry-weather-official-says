             European Union sugar production may
fall because of dry weather in the region, according to an
official at the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm.  
 “This year there could be less production because of
dryness,”  Lars Hoelgaard , deputy director general of
agriculture and rural development at the Brussels-based European
Commission, said today in an interview at a conference in
Cambridge, England.  
 Rainfall in northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and
western Germany was between 60 percent and 80 percent of normal
in the 180 days through July 5, according to forecaster Martell
Crop Projections. That includes the main EU beet-producing
regions.  
 Lower output in Europe may spur companies in the chemical
and bio-ethanol industries to compete for sugar supplies,
Hoelgaard said. The EU must import 3.2 million metric tons of
the sweetener in 2010-11 to meets its consumption needs,
according to figures he presented.  
 Beet-growing regions of France, the world’s largest
producer of the root, remained “very” rainfall-deficient, the
national Institut Technique de la Betterave said in a July 6
report. Sugar  yields  will drop to 13.5 million tons per hectare
(2.5 acres) from last year’s record 14.5 million tons, it
predicted.  
 Still, potential remains for rain to fall before harvesting
begins in September or October, Hoelgaard said.
