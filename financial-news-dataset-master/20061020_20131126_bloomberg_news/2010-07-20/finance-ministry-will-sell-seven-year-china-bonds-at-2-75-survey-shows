             China’s finance ministry will sell
at least 28 billion yuan ($4.1 billion) of seven-year bonds at
2.75 percent today, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 The highest forecast was 2.83 percent and the lowest 2.7
percent, the survey of 18 finance companies showed.  
 Similar-maturity notes yielded 2.78 percent yesterday,
according to  rates  compiled by Chinabond, the nation’s largest
debt-clearing house. The ministry last sold securities due in a
year on May 26 at 2.83 percent.  
 Investors will bid on the yield at the auction. The issuer
will set the security’s coupon by taking an average of the
winning bids. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
