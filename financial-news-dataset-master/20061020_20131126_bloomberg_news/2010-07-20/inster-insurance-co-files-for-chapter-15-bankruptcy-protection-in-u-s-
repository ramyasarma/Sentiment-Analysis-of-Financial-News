             Minster Insurance Co. Ltd. sought
bankruptcy protection from creditors in the U.S.  
 The company, based in London, listed both debt and assets
of more than $100 million in Chapter 15 documents filed
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Chapter 15
protects foreign companies from U.S. lawsuits and creditor
claims while reorganizing abroad.  
 Minster and Malvern Insurance Co. Ltd., which also sought
protection, are insurance and reinsurance companies that no
longer write new business. Both companies are based in London
and their assets are primarily located in England, court papers
show.  
 “The ultimate goal of each of the companies is to satisfy
the claims” of creditors and “conclude the business of the
companies sooner” than would be the case outside of bankruptcy,
James Lee Saitch, foreign representative of Minster and Malvern,
said in court papers.  
 Minster is asking the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize
the proceeding currently pending before the High Court of
Justice of England and Wales as a “foreign main proceeding,”
according to court papers. The proceeding in the English Court
commenced in 2009, according to court papers.  
 The case is In re Minster Insurance Co. Ltd., 10-13899,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).
