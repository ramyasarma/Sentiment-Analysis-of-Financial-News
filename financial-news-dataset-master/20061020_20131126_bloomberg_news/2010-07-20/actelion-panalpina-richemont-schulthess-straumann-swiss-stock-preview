             Swiss stocks fell for a fourth day
as financial shares declined after Hungary raised less money
than its government had targeted in a bond auction, offsetting
gains by  Actelion Ltd.  and  Swatch Group AG .  
 UBS AG  and  Credit Suisse Group AG  dropped 0.9 percent and
0.8 percent, respectively. Actelion surged 4 percent after it
reported increased second-quarter net income.  Swatch Group AG 
gained 1.1 percent as Hermes International SCA raised its 2010
sales target.  
 The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  lost 33.18, or 0.5
percent, to 6,123.46 at 1:20 p.m. in Zurich. The gauge has
retreated 12 percent from this year’s high on April 15 amid
speculation that Europe’s debt crisis may derail the economic
recovery and concern that the Chinese authorities are cooling
their nation’s rate of growth. The broader  Swiss Performance
Index  also declined 0.5 percent.  
 “Current levels are pricing in a lot of risk and may
anticipate a couple of good months for equity markets,” said
Manfred Hofer, head of equity analysis at LGT Capital Management
AG in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland, which oversees about $73 billion.
“Then you will have to be cautious again as markets will remain
bumpy till the end of the year.”  
 Hungarian Auction  
 The Hungarian government raised 35 billion forint ($156
million), 10 billion forint less than it planned, at a sale of
three-month Treasury bills. The cost of new debt rose from the
previous auction a week earlier.  
 The average yield on the auctioned maturity rose to 5.47
percent from 5.28 percent on July 13, according to Hungary’s
debt management agency. Investors bid 52.5 billion forint
compared with 102.5 billion a week earlier.  
 UBS and Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s biggest banks, dropped
0.9 percent to 14.83 Swiss francs and 0.8 percent to 42.82
francs.  
 Swiss Reinsurance Co. , the world’s second-largest
reinsurer, lost 1.6 percent to 45.93 francs.  
 Actelion advanced 4 percent to 42.20 francs. Switzerland’s
largest biotechnology company reported higher second-quarter net
income, helped by increased sales of its Tracleer lung medicine.  
 Profit rose 4.5 percent to 121.4 million francs ($115.5
million), from 116.2 million francs a year earlier, the
Allschwil, Switzerland-based company said.  
 Luxury Goods Gain  
 Swatch, the maker of Omega and Breguet timepieces, gained
1.1 percent to 314.40 francs. Hermes International raised its
2010 sales forecast after second-quarter revenue rose faster
than analysts had estimated, on higher demand in Asia.  
 Full-year revenue may grow as much as 12 percent, Paris-
based Hermes said. In March, the 173 year-old luxury goods
company forecast that revenue would grow by about 5 percent.  
 Separately, Swiss watch exports rose 35 percent in June,
the Federal Customs Office said.  
 Shares in  Nestle SA , the world’s biggest food company, fell
0.9 percent to 52.60 francs.  
 Schulthess Group AG  fell 0.8 percent to 33.75 francs.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgraded the maker of heat pumps to
“sell” from “neutral,” citing “last week’s profit
warning.”
