             U.K. stocks rose for the first time
in six days after better-than-estimated earnings at Apple Inc.
boosted ARM Holdings Plc and higher commodity prices caused
mining companies to rally.  
 ARM, the U.K. designer of semiconductors used in Apple’s
iPhone, rose 3.5 percent. GlaxoSmithKline Plc gained 0.9 percent
after profit excluding restructuring costs and legal expenses
beat forecasts. BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group led gains
among raw-materials producers. SSL International Plc surged 33
percent after  Reckitt Benckiser Plc  made an offer for the maker
of Durex condoms and Scholl shoes.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  gained 89.6, or 1.7 percent,
to 5,229.06 at 1:13 p.m. in London. The  FTSE All-Share Index 
rose 1.6 percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  advanced 1.7 percent.  
 The FTSE 100 has fallen 10 percent from this year’s high on
April 15 amid concern that the U.S and Chinese economies are
slowing and as European governments slash their budget deficits
and cut spending.  
 “Things aren’t as bad as many people out there in the
market seem to think right now,” Peter Dixon, a global equities
economist at Commerzbank AG, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview
from London today. “Growth will slow, yes, but I’m not in the
‘double-dip’ camp.”  
 Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew
Sentance voted for a second month to increase interest rates to
0.75 percent, according to the minutes of the July 8 decision.
The other seven policy makers overruled Sentance, all voting to
keep interest rates at a record low as the economic outlook had
“deteriorated a little.”  
 ARM Rises  
 ARM  rose 3.5 percent to 311.1 pence. Apple yesterday
forecast sales in the three months through September will be
about $18 billion, more than the $17 billion that analysts had
predicted. The company also reported fiscal third-quarter sales
and net income that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  
 Glaxo climbed 0.9 percent to 1,184 pence. Net income
excluding restructuring costs and legal expenses totaled 29.3
pence a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 28.1
pence.  
 BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining company, advanced
3 percent to 1,927.5 pence. Rio Tinto, the third-largest miner,
gained 2.8 percent to 3,261 pence. Copper rose for a third day
on the London Metals Exchange.  
 GKN Plc surged 6.8 percent to 142.2 pence, its highest
price since May, after saying its trading performance
“continued to improve strongly” during the second quarter of
2010. The company will report pretax profit of at least 170
million pounds ($259.5 million) for the first half of 2010.  
 Condom Takeover  
 SSL surged 34 percent to 1,178 pence after Reckitt
Benckiser agreed to buy the condom maker for 2.54 billion
pounds. SSL shareholders will receive 1,163 pence per share,
according to a statement.  
 BP Plc rose 3.3 percent to 400.1 pence after agreeing to
sell oil and gas fields in the U.S., Canada, and Egypt to Apache
Corp. for $7 billion, raising cash to meet the costs of the Gulf
of Mexico spill.  
 Johnson Matthey Plc , the chemicals company that diversified
into vehicle emissions control technology, rose 2.8 percent to
1,645 pence. Chairman  John Banham  said quarterly sales through
June rose 32 percent and the second quarter would be
“significantly stronger,” according to a statement.  
 Galiform Plc  gained 4.4 percent to 66.55 pence. The owner
of the Howden Joinery builders’ merchant brand said first-half
pretax profit increased to 21.6 million pounds from 4.7 million
pounds in the same period a year earlier.  
 Ocado Group Plc, the loss-making U.K. online grocer, sank
9.2 percent to 163.5 pence on the first day of conditional
trading in London after skepticism over the valuation led the
company to reduce the price for its initial public offering.  
 Smith & Nephew Plc slumped 4.2 percent to 562.5 pence after
Citigroup Inc. managed the sale of 8 million of the company’s
shares for 559 pence each.
