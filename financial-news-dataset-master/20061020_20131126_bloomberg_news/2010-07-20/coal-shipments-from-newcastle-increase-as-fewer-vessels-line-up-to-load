             Coal shipments from Australia’s
Newcastle, the world’s biggest export port for the power station
fuel, rose 16 percent last week while the number of vessels
waiting to load shortened.  
 The volume exported in the week ended 7 a.m. local time
yesterday climbed to 2.16 million metric tons from 1.86 million
tons in the preceding period, Newcastle Port Corp. said on its
website today. Rio Tinto Group,  Xstrata Plc  and BHP Billiton Ltd.
are among mining companies that ship the fuel from the harbor.  
 Eleven vessels  were outside the harbor, down from 12 a week
earlier. Seventy vessels were traveling to the port to load coal,
Newcastle Port said.  
 Coal ships waited to load for an average of 9.84 days, down
from 11.85 days, the Newcastle Port said in its report. That
compares with 0.24 day for general-cargo vessels.  
 Power-station coal prices at Newcastle, an Asian benchmark,
fell 0.7 percent, according to the globalCOAL NEWC Index. Prices
dropped to $96.34 a ton in the week ended July 16 from $97.06.
