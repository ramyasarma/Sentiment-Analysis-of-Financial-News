             Gold futures fluctuated between
gains and losses in New York, hovering around the 100-day moving
average.  
 Earlier, the metal touched $1,175.10 an ounce, extending a
slide to the lowest level in eight weeks. The slump may resume
should the price close below the moving average at $1,178.34.
Gold has dropped as much as 7.2 percent from a record $1,266.50
on June 21.  
 “We look for the market to put up a good fight around the
100-day moving average,” said  Matt Zeman , a trader at LaSalle
Futures Group in Chicago. “A lot of investors are going to pull
the trigger on a break of that moving average. But right now,
some investors are buying gold on sale.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery rose $5.90, or 0.5
percent, to $1,187.80 at 10:20 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price climbed as much as 0.6 percent.  
 Before today, the metal advanced 7.8 percent this year
after nine straight annual gains. Gold also reached records last
month in euros, British sterling and Swiss francs amid Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  
 “For buy-and-hold types of people, fiscal irresponsibility
is too widespread to completely trust fiat currencies,” Zeman
said.  
 Russian Reserves Grow  
 Moody’s Investors Service cut Ireland’s credit rating one
level to Aa2 yesterday, citing a “significant loss of financial
strength” and the cost of bank bailouts.  
 Russia’s central bank added 200,000 ounces of gold to its
reserves last month, increasing the stockpile to 22.8 million
ounces (709.2 metric tons), the bank said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Silver futures for September rose 10.2 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $17.645 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery fell $9.10, or 0.6
percent, to $1,504 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery dropped $3.15, or
0.7 percent, to $440.75 an ounce, also on Nymex.
