             Enel SpA  may invest 12 billion euros
($16 billion) in the energy market in Latin America, MF
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 Italy’s biggest utility would carry out the investments
through its Endesa SA unit, the Spanish company it gained
control of in 2007, the newspaper said. The investments may be
made in segments including hydroelectric power and renewable
energy, MF said.
