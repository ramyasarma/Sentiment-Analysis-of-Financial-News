             Franck Ribery  and  Karim Benzema , two
members of the national French soccer team, are being questioned
by police today about their alleged relation with an underage
prostitute.  
 The woman, who is now 18 and goes by the name Zahia, said
in an interview and  photo spread  with magazine Paris Match in
April that she had relations with several players on the
national team, whom she met at a Paris nightclub. She said in
the interview that she hadn’t told them she was under 18 at the
time.  
 Paying for sex is legal in France. Pimping and soliciting
clients are illegal, as is prostitution under the age of 18.  
 Sophie Bottai, Ribery’s lawyer, told reporters during a
break in the questioning that her client has reiterated that he
didn’t know Zahia’s age.  
 “To be a crime, he’d have to have known she was a minor,
which was not the case, and she’d have to have had the
appearance of a minor, which was not the case,” Bottai said.
“He is calm.”  
 Ribery, who plays his club football for Bayern Munich, has
played 48 times for France and was a member of the team that was
eliminated in the first round of the 2010 World Cup. Real
Madrid’s Benzema has played 27 times for the national team, but
wasn’t selected for this year’s World Cup.  
 A spokesman for the Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed the
players were being questioned but said he didn’t have any
comment yet about whether they would be treated as simple
witnesses or placed under investigation.
