             Germany’s Transport Minister Peter
Ramsauer said the World Trade Organization should be given the
job of ensuring even competition within the airline industry,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview.  
 “There is no traffic that’s more internationalized than
air traffic,” Ramsauer was cited as saying by the newspaper.
“Why should the WTO only discuss the environment and trade
barriers?”  
 Germany is considering “very seriously” requests by
Emirates for additional landing rights in the country, Ramsauer
said, according to Handelsblatt.
