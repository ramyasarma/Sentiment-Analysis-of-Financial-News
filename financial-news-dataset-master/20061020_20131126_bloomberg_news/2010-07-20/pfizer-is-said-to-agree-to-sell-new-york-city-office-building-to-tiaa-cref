             Pfizer Inc., the drugmaker cutting
costs after buying Wyeth, agreed to sell a New York skyscraper
to TIAA-CREF, said two people with knowledge of the transaction.  
 The deal for 685 Third Ave. in Midtown sets the price at
$180 million to $190 million, one of the people said. Both
declined to be identified because the transaction isn’t
complete.  
 The deal would be at least the seventh for a Manhattan
skyscraper in the past three months, showing increased
confidence among buyers that the city’s office market may have
reached bottom. U.S. commercial real estate prices rose for the
second straight month in May, Moody’s Investors Service said
yesterday.  
 “That reflects the demand and competition,” Robert Bach,
chief economist for Grubb & Ellis Co., a Santa Ana, California-
based commercial property broker, said in a telephone interview
about the Moody’s report.  
 Manhattan real estate owners sold $2.92 billion of
commercial property in the first half, up 70 percent from a year
earlier, according to preliminary data from New York-based
research firm Real Capital Analytics. About $1.42 billion of
those sales were for office buildings, up 62 percent from a year
earlier.  
 Pfizer , the world’s largest drugmaker, told New York
officials in April it planned to sell the 634,000 square-foot
Third Avenue tower as it consolidates operations.  
 A Pfizer official declined to comment yesterday.  
 Firing Workers  
 The company has been firing workers and shutting facilities
following its $68 billion  buyout  last year of Madison, New
Jersey-based rival Wyeth. It has said it will cut 19,000 jobs,
close eight manufacturing plants and eliminate six research
centers as it seeks to lower costs.  
 Pfizer is also bracing to lose patent protection next year
on its top-selling product, the Lipitor cholesterol pill, which
generated $11 billion in 2009 sales.  
 In 2003, the New York-based drugmaker said it planned to
spend $1 billion over 15 years to expand in the city and add
jobs. Since then, it has fired 40,000 employees worldwide in
addition to the 19,000 it plans to shed after buying Wyeth.  
 The company already stopped receiving city benefits under a
deal intended to lure companies to relocate or expand in New
York. It may have to refund tax breaks and pay penalties of as
much as double the $12 million it got in public benefits,  David Lombino , spokesman for the city Economic Development Corp., said
in May.  
 Teacher’s Role  
 TIAA-CREF, founded in 1918 as a pension fund for
professors, is the largest provider of retirement plans for
employees of academic, medical and research institutions. The
firm manages about $426 billion and also sells mutual funds and
education-savings plans.  
 It made its first real estate investments in 1947,
according to information on its  website . The firm says it has
more than 400 real estate investments in the United States and
Europe with equity of about $15 billion as of September 30.  
 “We continually seek to improve the quality of our
real estate portfolio through carefully identified, high-
quality acquisitions,” said Abby Cohen, a spokeswoman for
TIAA-CREF.
