             India’s benchmark stock index
declined for a second day. Lenders led the drop after a central
bank deputy governor said bank deposit growth isn’t accelerating.  
 ICICI Bank Ltd., the nation’s second-largest lender, lost
1.5 percent. Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor K.C.
Chakrabarty said the pace at which deposits are increasing isn’t
getting faster, while credit growth is “quite strong.” Housing
Development Finance Corp., the biggest mortgage lender, fell the
most in three weeks.  
 “It’s not a good development for banks,” said  Apurva Shah ,
head of research at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. in Mumbai. “If you
don’t have deposits, you have to borrow from the interbank
market, and that is always slightly more expensive and slightly
more unstable.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
declined 50.28, or 0.3 percent, to 17,878.14 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock
Exchange retreated 0.3 percent to 5,368. The  BSE 200 Index 
declined 0.3 percent to 2,278.9.  
 ICICI Bank  dropped 1.5 percent to 886.85 rupees. Housing
Development Finance also fell 1.5 percent, to 3013.6 rupees. An
increase in the amount of cash reserves banks need to set aside
to cover deposits may pose difficulty for lenders now,
Chakrabarty said in Hyderabad today.  
 A high  inflation  rate in Asia’s fastest growing major
economy after China is putting pressure on India’s central bank
to raise interest rates for a fourth time in five months at a
July 27 monetary policy meeting.  
 Sesa Goa  
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., India’s largest copper
producer, rose 1.6 percent to 166.35 rupees, tracking metal
prices higher. Copper in London rose for a second day as the
longest streak of inventory declines in more than a year fueled
optimism about the demand outlook.  
 Sesa Goa , the nation’s biggest iron-ore exporter, climbed
1.6 percent to 353.85 rupees after it said first-quarter profit
rose three-fold from a year earlier on higher prices of the
steelmaking raw material. Group  net income  increased to 13
billion rupees ($276 million) in the three months ended June 30
from 4.2 billion rupees a year earlier, the Panaji, Goa-based
company said in a statement posted on its website.  
 Emerging-market equity funds jumped to more than $3 billion
in the week to July 14 as the start of the U.S. earnings season
prompted a rebound in optimism, according to EPFR Global. Indian
equity funds absorbed $114 million, a 13-week high, as forecasts
for monsoon rainfall improved.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net 7.6 billion rupees ($162.3
million) of Indian equities on July 16, raising total
investments in the  stocks  this year to 401.2 billion rupees,
according to the nation’s market  regulator .  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Bayer CropScience Ltd.  (BYRCS IN), a maker of agrochemicals,
climbed 6 percent to 857.25 rupees, its steepest advance since
April, after saying it plans to sell about 100 acres of land.  
 Jubilant Organosys Ltd.  (JOL IN), a drugmaker, rose 2.3
percent to 365.95 rupees. The company was rated “buy” in new
coverage by  Nishant Patel , an analyst at Antique Stock Broking,
with a 12-month price estimate of 508 rupees a share.  
 MindTree Ltd.  (MTCL IN), an information technology provider,
dropped 5.4 percent to 538.9 rupees after first-quarter profit
fell 72 percent to 158 million rupees.  
 Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd.  (TRE IN) declined 3.8
percent to 99.1 rupees after posting a third-quarter loss of
142.3 million rupees in the three months ended June 30, compared
with profit of 398.1 million rupees a year earlier.  
 Vishal Retail Ltd.  (VISH IN), advanced 1.3 percent to 52.1
rupees after the Business Standard newspaper reported Shriram
Group may buy the front-end retail division of Vishal while
Texas Pacific Group may take over the wholesale unit. Vishal
Retail Chairman  Ram Chandra Agarwal  declined to comment on the
report.
