             Exxon Mobil Corp ., the world’s
largest oil company, restarted halted units at its  Augusta 
refinery in Italy after a boiler fault on July 18.  
 The failed boiler, the main generator of steam at the site,
brought down oil processing units, a Rome-based spokeswoman for
Exxon said today by phone, declining to be named in line with
company policy. Most of the halted units are back in operation
after the fault, which occurred at about 5 p.m. local time and
led to flaring for a couple of hours, she said.  
 The refinery has the capacity to process 190,000 barrels of
oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Flaring is a
safety measure used to vent gases to prevent pressure build-up
when normal refinery operations are disrupted.
