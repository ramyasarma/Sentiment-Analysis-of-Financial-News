             Copper climbed for a second day in
Asia, pacing an advance in industrial metals, on optimism that
economic growth in China, the world’s largest user, will boost
demand and offset a slowdown in the U.S. and Europe.  
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 1.5 percent to $6,610 a metric ton, and
traded at $6,591 at 3:31 p.m. in Singapore. October copper on
the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained as much as 1.6 percent, the
most in a week, to 53,130 yuan ($7,840) a ton, before ending the
day at 53,060 yuan.  
 “Positive sentiment is spilling over from the equities
market,” said Yang Su, an analyst at Jiangsu Suwu Futures
Brokerage Co. “This is likely to be just a short-term boost,”
said Yang.  
 Chinese stocks  rallied for a second day on prospects that
the government may relax tightening measures as the economy
slows. Stocks also climbed after the China Securities Journal
said that the government may allow overseas investors to trade
derivatives contracts, spurring inflows of overseas capital.  
 China’s economic expansion eased to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter, a sign the nation’s macroeconomic policies are
working and that growth has gradually been restored to
“normal,”  Yi Xianrong , a researcher with the Institute of
Finance and Banking under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
wrote in a commentary published in today’s China Daily newspaper.
Copper is used in pipes and wires.  
 Budget Deficits  
 Copper has fallen 11 percent this year on concern that
widening budget deficits in Europe may derail the economic
recovery, and as China increased bank reserve requirements three
times to curb record loan growth and asset bubbles.  
 “The debt crisis in Europe is on the backburner for now
but it hasn’t been resolved, recent U.S. economic data points to
uncertainties with regards to recovery and growth, and China’s
growth will continue to slow,” said Yang. “We’ll get relief
rallies but all these will cap the upside for metals.”  
 Copper also advanced today after  stockpiles  in LME
warehouses fell yesterday for the 22nd day, matching this year’s
longest period of declines. Inventories stood at 422,850 tons,
the lowest level since Nov. 20. They’re down 16 percent this
year and headed for the first annual drop since 2004.  
 “Supply-side concerns have been supportive of copper
prices for many years and lower inventories are always a good
reason for higher prices,” said Yang.  
 Codelco, the world’s largest producer, restarted mining
yesterday at its largest Norte division after high winds stopped
activities at the site in northern Chile on July 18, a company
official briefed on the matter said by phone yesterday.  
 Aluminum in London gained 0.8 percent to $1,987 a ton, zinc
rose 2.1 percent to $1,846.50 a ton and lead added 1.5 percent
to $1,801 a ton. Nickel climbed 1.5 percent to $19,081 a ton a
ton, and tin was up 0.3 percent at $18,000 a ton by 3:16 p.m. in
Singapore.
