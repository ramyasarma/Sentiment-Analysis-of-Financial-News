             The European Union praised
Bulgaria’s efforts to tackle corruption while warning Romania
about “important shortcomings” in the area.  
 “While Bulgaria has embraced reform efforts and achieved
important results, Romania has lost momentum,” the European
Commission, the EU executive, said in a report issued today in
Brussels. For Romania, the report shows “important shortcomings
in its efforts to achieve progress,” it said.   
 “In both countries, the leadership of the judiciary needs
to take more responsibility for the benefit of reform,” the
commission said.
