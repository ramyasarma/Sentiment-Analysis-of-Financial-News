             Accor SA , Europe’s largest hotel
company, said first-half sales rose as occupancy improved.  
 Revenue climbed 6 percent to 2.85 billion euros ($3.7
billion), the Evry, France-based company said in a statement
today. Excluding the services unit, which was spun off this
month, second-quarter sales increased to 1.72 billion euros from
1.57 billion euros a year earlier, beating the 1.64 billion-euro
average  estimate  from four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 European hotels’ occupancy rose almost 7 percent in May,
while revenue per available room rose 9 percent, the most this
year, according to researcher STR Global. Accor’s first-half
hotel sales increased 7.5 percent from a year earlier, when a
drop in business travel contributed to lower revenue.  
 “Accor should benefit as much, if not more, than peers
from the hotel industry rebound, led by Europe,” said Oddo &
Cie equity analyst  Guillaume Rascoussier  in Paris. He has a
“buy” recommendation on the company.  
 Accor  shares advanced 19 cents, or 0.8 percent, to close at
23.19 euros as of 5:30 p.m. in Paris. The sales were released
after markets closed. The stock has fallen 1.5 percent since
July 2, when it began trading without the voucher-service unit,
 Edenred , which has jumped almost 23 from its reference price.  
 Accor is scheduled to report first-half earnings Aug. 26.
