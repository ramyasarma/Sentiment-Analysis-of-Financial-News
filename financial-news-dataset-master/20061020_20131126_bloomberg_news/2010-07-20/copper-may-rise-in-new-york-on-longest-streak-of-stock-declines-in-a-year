             Copper may rise for a second day in
New York on the longest streak of inventory declines in more
than a year and on gains by Chinese equities that fueled
optimism about the demand outlook.  
 Stockpiles  of copper tracked by the London Metal Exchange
shrank for a 23rd day today.  Chinese shares  rallied for a second
day on prospects that the state may relax tightening measures as
the economy slows. Concern about efforts to curb growth in
China, the world’s biggest copper user, contributed to LME
metal’s 16 percent drop in the second quarter.  
 “Stronger Chinese equities suggest that the prospects for
the Chinese economy are improving,”  David Thurtell , a Citigroup
Inc. analyst in London, said by telephone. “Copper stocks keep
falling.”  
 Futures for September delivery gained 0.85 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.9465 a pound at 8:05 a.m. on the Comex in New
York, paring a gain of as much as 1.5 percent. Copper for
delivery in three months added 0.5 percent to $6,542 a metric
ton on the LME.  
 LME-monitored copper inventories fell to 419,600 tons, the
lowest level since Nov. 18. The current streak of drops is the
longest since a 40-session run that ended on July 2, 2009, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows. Stockpiles are down 16 percent this
year and on course for the first annual drop since 2004.  
 Discount Narrows  
 Bookings  to remove copper from LME warehouses jumped 5.7
percent to 33,050 tons. Immediate-delivery metal’s discount to
the three-month price, the so-called contango, narrowed to
$15.25 yesterday from $16.25 in the previous session and $21 a
week ago.  
 Prices pared gains as the dollar rebounded. The U.S. Dollar
Index, a six-currency gauge of the greenback’s strength,
advanced as much as 0.6 percent, wiping out a drop. A stronger
dollar makes metals priced in the currency more expensive in
terms of other monies.  
 Chinese economic growth slowed to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter and the consumer price index dropped 0.6 percent
in June from May, signaling a diminishing risk of overheating,
figures showed last week. Industrial output in the country rose
13.7 percent last month, less than all but one of 27 forecasts
in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “Certainly last week’s GDP data showed a moderation in
growth, but more importantly, the CPI fell, which gives Beijing
more scope to take its foot off the brake,” Citigroup’s
Thurtell said. “That is good for metals demand.”  
 More Usage, Limited Supply  
 Increased copper consumption and limited supplies of
refined and scrap metal will support prices, Laredo, Texas-based
researcher Harbor Intelligence said in a monthly report e-mailed
yesterday. Usage will outpace supply by 125,000 tons this year,
with the deficit widening to 180,000 tons next year, according
to the report.  
 “Prices have exited the correction/bear-market phase, and
we should expect higher prices for the rest of the year and
early 2011,” Harbor Intelligence said. Comex copper will
average $3.28 a pound ($7,231 a ton) this year before rising to
$3.70 next year, the researcher predicted.  
 Still, a report due at 8:30 a.m. Washington time probably
will show that housing starts in the U.S., the second-largest
copper consumer, fell in June to the lowest level of the year,
economists said. Work began on 577,000 houses, down 2.7 percent
from May and the fewest since December, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Construction accounts for a quarter of copper demand,
according to the  Copper Development Association .  
 Aluminum, Tin  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery on the LME fell 1 percent
to $1,953 a ton after stockpiles increased the most in four
months. Inventories in LME warehouses rose 1.1 percent, the
biggest climb since March 18, to 4.42 million tons.  
 Cash metal’s discount to the three-month contract, widened
to $21.50 yesterday. It shrank on July 15 to $16.25, the
narrowest closing level since April 2007.  
 Lead gained 0.6 percent to $1,785 a ton and nickel advanced
0.2 percent to $18,840 a ton. Zinc climbed 1.7 percent to $1,838
a ton and tin fell 0.3 percent to $17,900 a ton.
