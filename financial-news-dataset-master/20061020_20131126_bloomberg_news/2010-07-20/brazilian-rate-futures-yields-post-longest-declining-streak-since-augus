             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts fell for a sixth day, the longest streak since
August, after a drop in consumer prices fueled speculation
policy makers may slow the pace of interest-rate increases.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 10.98 percent at 9:04 a.m. New York time. Earlier it
touched 10.97 percent, the lowest level since June 8. It dropped
for six straight days in the period ended Aug. 17.  
 “It does mean the case for less tightening is valid,”
said  Marcelo Salomon , an economist with Barclays in Sao Paulo.
“We maintain our view that the central bank will raise the rate
by 75 basis points tomorrow to bring down the growth rate to a
more sustained level. But the central bank has to acknowledge
the growth and inflation slowdown, a combination arguing for
less tightening going forward.”  
 Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index fell 0.09
percent in the June 15-July 13 period, the first decline in four
years, the national statistics agency said. Economists expected
the index to rise 0.02 percent, according to the median of 36
estimates in a survey of economists conducted by Bloomberg.  
 Brazil’s central bank will raise borrowing costs by three-
quarters of a percentage point to 11 percent at the conclusion
of a two-day policy meeting tomorrow, according to 36 of 38
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Economists at Squanto
Investimentos Ltda and Banco Bradesco SA forecast a 50-basis-
point increase. Futures contracts due in August suggest traders
are forecasting an increase of less than 75 basis points.  
 The real fell 0.1 percent to 1.7940 per dollar, from 1.7926
yesterday.
