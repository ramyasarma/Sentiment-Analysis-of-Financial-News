             Facebook Inc. scored in the bottom 5
percent of a customer-satisfaction survey, below Internet rivals
Google Inc. and Yahoo! Inc., as the social-networking site’s
frequent changes rankled users.  
 Facebook received 64 on a 100-point scale, while  Google 
scored 80 and  Yahoo  got 76, according to a report based on the
American Customer Satisfaction Index, which was developed by the
University of Michigan’s business school. Concerns about privacy,
design changes and aggressive advertising hurt Facebook’s status,
the report found.  
 Facebook  has grappled with user complaints this year, while
still attracting advertisers and millions of new members. In May,
the company simplified privacy settings to make it easier for
people to protect their personal data. Its U.S. users climbed to
141.6 million last month, up 84 percent from a year earlier,
according to Reston, Virginia-based ComScore Inc.  
 “They’ve had this great growth -- you can’t say anything
negative about that,” said  Larry Freed , chief executive officer
of Ann Arbor, Michigan-based ForeSee Results Inc., a sponsor of
the survey. “Low satisfaction means you’re starting to put that
growth at risk.”  
 Facebook ranked in the same range as airlines and cable
companies, two groups that typically score low on satisfaction
surveys, according to the report.  
 ‘Room to Improve’  
 “We haven’t reviewed the survey methodology in detail, but
clearly we have room to improve,” Facebook said in a statement.
“Building a simple, useful service is the best way to earn and
sustain the trust people put in us. That’s why we spend so much
of our time and energy focused on improving the products we
offer and introducing new ones.”  
 The nonprofit site Wikipedia.org ranked the highest among
social-media companies, with a score of 77.  Google ’s YouTube
site got a rating of 73, and  News Corp. ’s MySpace came in below
Facebook, with a score of 63.  
 Facebook, which started as a college-networking site, is
now attracting older users. They may not be as comfortable with
the site’s frequent changes, Freed said.  
 “Satisfaction is a combination of what you get and what
you expect,” he said. “Expectations play a major, major role
in satisfaction.”
