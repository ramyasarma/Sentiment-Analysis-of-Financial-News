             At least five people were injured in
Kya Sands in northern Johannesburg late yesterday when foreign 
immigrants were attacked by mobs, Talk Radio 702 reported on 
its website, citing victims and other eyewitnesses.  
 Of the four wounded four were either Zimbabwean or 
Mozambican while the other, a South African, said he had been 
mistaken for a foreigner, the Johannesburg-based radio station 
said.   
 Xenophobic violence in South Africa claimed more than 60 
lives in May 2008.
