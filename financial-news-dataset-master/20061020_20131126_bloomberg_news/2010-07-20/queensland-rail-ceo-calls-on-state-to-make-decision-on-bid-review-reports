             Queensland needs to make a decision
on the A$4.85 billion bid for QR National’s rail network by coal
companies to end uncertainty around a planned initial public
offer, the Australian Financial Review reported, citing an
interview with QR National Chief Executive Officer Lance
Hockridge. QR National is owned by the Queensland state
government. The float is planned before the end of 2010.
