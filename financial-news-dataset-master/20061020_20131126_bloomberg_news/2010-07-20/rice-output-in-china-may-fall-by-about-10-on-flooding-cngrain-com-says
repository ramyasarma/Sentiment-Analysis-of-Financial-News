             China’s rice output may drop by
about 10 percent on torrential rains and outbreaks of pests,
industry website cngrain.com said on its website today, citing
its own forecast. In some of the main producing areas the
production decline may be as much as 20 percent, it said.
Harvest of the early indica rice crop may be delayed 7-15 days
on adverse weather, it said.  
 The website is owned by the China Grain Reserves Corp.,
which is known as Sinograin and stockpiles food commodities on
behalf of the government.
