             National Aluminium Co., India’s
second-biggest producer of the metal, gave companies an
additional month to bid to build its first wind power project.  
 “We decided to extend the deadline to have more
competitive bidding,” B.K. Das, chief manager of the auction,
said by telephone today from Bhubaneswar in the eastern state of
Orissa, where state-owned National Aluminium is based.  
 Companies interested in building and operating the 50-
megawatt wind plant for 20 years now have until 3 p.m. local
time on Aug. 20 to bid for the project, Das said, declining to
say if any offers have been received. The previous deadline was
today, he said.  
 The aluminum producer is expanding capacity to produce
power to help feed its smelters and reduce the purchase of
expensive electricity. National Aluminum boosted its power
generation capacity by 13 percent to 1,080 megawatts after
commissioning a 120-megawatt unit in the quarter ending June 30,
according to a research note by Anand Rathi Securities on May 18.  
 Overseas and Indian companies may bid for the wind project
and should be prepared to complete the plant within eight months
of signing a letter of intent, Das said.
