             Oil traded near a three-week high as
equities climbed and an industry report showed a decline in U.S.
crude inventories.  
 Oil rose as much as 0.4 percent earlier as Asian stocks
gained on stronger-than-estimated earnings at Apple Inc., and a
report from the American Petroleum Institute showed that crude
supplies declined last week. The Energy Department will release
its weekly inventory report today.  
 “We’ve got the U.S. reporting season underway at the
moment, it’s looking better than expected,”  Mark Pervan , a
senior commodity strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd., said in a Bloomberg Television interview from
Melbourne. “Oil’s been a bit choppy recently, tracking sideways.
A lot of it depends on the macro data in the U.S.”  
 Crude oil for September delivery was at $77.63 a barrel, up
5 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 2:52 p.m. in Singapore. Yesterday, the contract
added 68 cents, or 0.9 percent, to close at $77.58 a barrel. Oil
has dropped 2.3 percent this year.  
 The contract for August expired yesterday, up 90 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $77.44 a barrel, the highest settlement since
June 28.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed at 115.58 as
of 3:51 p.m. in Tokyo. The dollar was at $1.2898 per euro at
2:55 p.m. in Singapore from $1.2880 in New York yesterday.  
 “The equity markets remain relatively strong and that’s
where the optimism lies with investors,”  Jonathan Barratt ,
managing director at Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney,
said by telephone. “There is a very mixed economic outlook at
the moment.”  
 Storm Approaching  
 Prices also gained yesterday after the National Hurricane
Center said a weather system over Puerto Rico and the Dominican
Republic has a 60 percent chance of becoming the second named
tropical cyclone of the Atlantic Hurricane season.  
 The Gulf of Mexico accounts for about 31 percent of U.S.
oil output and 10 percent of its natural-gas production and is
home to seven of the 10 busiest ports, according to the Energy
Department. States along the Gulf are home to 43 percent of
operable U.S. refining capacity.  
 U.S. crude stockpiles fell 241,000 barrels to 353.3 million
last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute. The
Energy Department may say  supplies declined  1.2 million barrels,
according to the median of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News before the release of its report at 10:30 a.m. today in
Washington.  
 The institute collects stockpile information on a voluntary
basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines.
The government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  
 Crude has been limited by the inability for prices to close
above the 200-day moving average price of $77.55 a barrel,
analysts at The Schork Group Inc. said in a report today.  
 “We are concerned that the bulls could not settle above
the 200-day moving average,” the report said. “This marks the
fourth time in the last five days that intraday trading has
peaked above $77.55 but giving up all those gains to settle
below the moving average.”  
 Brent crude oil for September settlement was at $76.25 a
barrel, up 3 cents, at 2:55 p.m. Singapore time on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Yesterday it gained 60 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to end the session at $76.22 a barrel.
