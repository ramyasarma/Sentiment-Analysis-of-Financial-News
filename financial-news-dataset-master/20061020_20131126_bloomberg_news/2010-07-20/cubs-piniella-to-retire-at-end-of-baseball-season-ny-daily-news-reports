             Lou Piniella  will retire as manager
of the Chicago Cubs at the end of the season, the New York Daily
News  reported , without citing where it received the information.  
 Piniella, 66, has been a Major League Baseball manager for
23 seasons and is 14th on the all-time wins list, posting a
1,826 and 1,691 record.  
 After winning the National League Central Division in his
first two seasons with the Cubs, the team missed the playoffs
last season and is currently in fourth place with a 42-52
record.  
 Piniella in 1984 retired as an outfielder for the New York
Yankees after 11 seasons with the club. He managed the Yankees
from 1986-1988, won a World Series with the Cincinnati Reds in
1990 and also had stints with the Seattle Mariners and Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.  
 An e-mail seeking comment from Cubs spokesman Peter Chase
wasn’t immediately returned.
