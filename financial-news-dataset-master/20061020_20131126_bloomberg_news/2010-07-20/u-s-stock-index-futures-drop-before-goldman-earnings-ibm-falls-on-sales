             U.S. stocks rose for a second day,
erasing earlier losses as speculation the Federal Reserve will
take steps to spur lending and an increase in building permits
sent homebuilders and commodity producers higher.  
 Lennar Corp. rose 6.3 percent and U.S. Steel Corp. gained
7.5 percent. Harley-Davidson Inc. advanced 14 percent after its
profits topped analyst estimates. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
increased 2.2 percent after reporting second-quarter earnings.
Johnson & Johnson fell the most in a month after the drugmaker
lowered its full-year earnings forecast.  
 The  S&P 500  rose 1.1 percent to 1,083.48 as of 4 p.m. in
New York after falling as much as 1.3 percent earlier. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  gained 75.53 points, or 0.7 percent, to
10,229.96 after declining as much as 1.4 percent earlier.  
 “The market has digested the perfect storm of bad economic
and earnings news at the open,” said  Art Hogan , chief market
analyst at New York-based Jefferies Group Inc. “Materials and
energy stocks are rising on a turnaround in commodity prices.,”
and “it’s knocked out one of the legs in the sell-story.”  
 Stocks rallied as traders speculated Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  may announce a reduction of the
interest rate the Fed pays on banks’ excess reserves to
stimulate economic growth.  
 Fed Speculation  
 “Some people are speculating about the Fed announcing it
tomorrow when Bernanke testifies,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief
economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York. “If you
suspend paying that money, you provide less of an incentive for
the banks to keep the money with the Fed and encourage them to
do something else with it. It will spur on the economy and could
turn the market around.”  
 Bernanke will give his semiannual report on monetary policy
to the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow. He will testify at the
House Financial Services Committee on July 22.  
 Homebuilders advanced after  building permits , a gauge of
future construction, rose 2.1 percent last month to a 586,000
pace, propelled by a 20 percent jump in multifamily applications
that are often volatile.  
 Lennar Corp.  gained 6.3 percent to $14.69.  Toll Brothers
Inc.  climbed 4.4 percent to $16.95.  Pulte Group Inc.  rallied 4.7
percent to $8.30.  
 The S&P 500 has gained 6 percent since July 2 on optimism
that corporate earnings would signal the economic recovery is
sustainable. Of the 42 companies in the S&P 500 that reported
from July 12 through the open of trading this morning, all but
nine beat earnings-per-share forecasts, according to Bloomberg
data. While second-quarter net income has topped analysts’
projections by 11 percent on average, revenue has been only 3.3
percent more than estimated, Bloomberg data show.  
 Apple, Yahoo  
 Apple Inc., Yahoo! Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. are among
companies that posted quarterly results after the official close
of U.S. exchanges today. The maker of the iPhone rose 2.6
percent to $251.89 during regular trading. After-hours, it said
earnings per share in the third quarter were $3.51, beating the
$3.11 average analyst estimate. The company said it expects
fourth-quarter per-share profit to be about $3.44, below the
$3.83 predicted by analysts.  
 Apple has beaten expectations in each report since 2003,
according to Birinyi Associates Inc. data. The shares advanced
4.1 percent to $262.13 in extended trading.  
 Yahoo! Inc. plunged 4.5 percent to $14.52 in trading after
the close as the owner of the second most-used search engine in
the U.S. after Google Inc. reported second-quarter sales
excluding revenue passed on to partner sites of $1.13 billion.
The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.16
billion.  
 Gilead Declines  
 Gilead dropped 2.3 percent to $32.25 after it reported
second-quarter adjusted profit of 85 cents a share after the
close of regular trading. The average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey was for an adjusted profit of 87 cents a share.  
 During the regular trading session, stocks rose further
when the S&P 500 was able to hold levels watched by analysts who
study charts and patterns.  
 “I’m encouraged that support in 1,055 to 1,065 range has
put up a solid fight, the bulls are defending this range,” New
York-based technical analyst  Christopher Verrone  said. “After
touching 1,010 in early July, the key is for the market to start
setting ‘higher-lows’ again and it looks like we’re headed in
that direction with today’s key reversal.”  
 Commodity producers rose the most of 10 industry groups in
the S&P 500, rallying 2.9 percent. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.
jumped 8.2 percent to $50.33. AK Steel Holding Corp. surged 6.7
percent to $14.41. U.S. Steel climbed 7.5 percent to $44.29.  
 Industrial Companies  
 An index of industrial companies in the S&P 500 rose 1.6
percent, up from an earlier loss of 1.5 percent. Caterpillar
Inc. rallied 2.5 percent to $66.43.  General Electric Co.  gained
2.2 percent to $14.94.  
 Harley-Davidson , the biggest U.S. motorcycle maker, rose
the most in the S&P 500, jumping 14 percent to $26.83 after
reporting profit that topped analysts’ estimates. Profit from
continuing operations rose more than fourfold to $139.3 million,
or 59 cents a share, from $33.4 million, or 14 cents, a year
earlier, Milwaukee-based Harley said. Profit was expected to be
41 cents a share, the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  
 Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, rose 2.2 percent to $148.91 after reporting second-
quarter net revenue of $8.84 billion. The average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for revenue of $8.94 billion.
The shares fell as much as 2.8 percent earlier.  
 IBM Falls  
 International Business Machines Corp. , the world’s biggest
computer-services company, sank 2.5 percent to $126.55. Revenue
last quarter rose 2 percent to $23.7 billion, the company said
late yesterday. Analysts on average estimated $24.2 billion,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 Texas Instruments, the  second-largest U.S. chipmaker , slid
3.1 percent to $24.77. Second-quarter profit rose to $769
million, or 62 cents a share, from $260 million, or 20 cents, a
year earlier, the Dallas-based company said after the close of
U.S. trading yesterday. Sales increased 42 percent to $3.5
billion. Analysts on average estimated profit of 63 cents a
share and sales of $3.52 billion, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  
 Housing starts fell in June to the lowest level since
October as a slump in sales following the expiration of a
government tax incentive caused U.S. builders to cut back.
Payrolls decreased in 27 U.S. states in June, led by California
and New York, signaling the slowdown in hiring is broad-based.
Employers in California cut staff by 27,600 workers last month
and those in New York reduced employment by 22,500, the Labor
Department said today in Washington.  
 Johnson & Johnson lost 1.7 percent to $58.58. The health-
products company cut its 2010 earnings forecast because of a
series of drug recalls. The company said earnings excluding some
items will be as little as $4.65 a share this year, missing the
average analyst estimate of $4.80, according to Bloomberg data.
