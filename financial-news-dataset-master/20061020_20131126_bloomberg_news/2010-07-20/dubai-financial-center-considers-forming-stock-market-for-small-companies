             Dubai International Financial
Center, a tax-free business park, is exploring the possibility
of setting up a “second-tier” stock exchange for small and
medium-sized companies in the Middle East.  
 The existing equity markets in the Middle East are geared
for bigger companies, although about 95 percent of the firms
operating in the region are small and medium-sized, the center’s
chief economist  Nasser Saidi  told reporters at the Gulf Venture
Capital Association conference in Dubai today. The private
equity industry needs a second-tier market where they can list
smaller companies with revenue of $20 million to $80 million and
which has less stringent listing rules, he said.  
 “We view this as an initiative for the region,” Saidi said.
Discussions have been held with a number of private equity firms
that may use the market although there is no timeframe yet to
set it up, he said.
