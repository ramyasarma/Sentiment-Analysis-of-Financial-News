             The U.S. will work with Afghanistan
to enable Afghan forces to take responsibility for more of the
country’s security, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the
Kabul summit today.  
 “The Afghan government, working with NATO, has developed a
broad framework for the process that will help create conditions
for transition, province by province, district by district, so
the Afghan security forces can assume responsibility for
security in the transitioned areas,” she said.   
 “We have no intention of abandoning our long-term mission
of achieving a stable, secure, peaceful Afghanistan,” Clinton
added.
