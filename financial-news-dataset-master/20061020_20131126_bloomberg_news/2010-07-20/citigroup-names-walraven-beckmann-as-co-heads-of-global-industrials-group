             Citigroup Inc . named  Wesley Walraven 
and  Wayne Beckmann  co-heads of the global industrials-banking
group, which caters to companies from automakers to miners.  
 The pair succeed  Eduardo Cruz , who was recently named head
of banking for Latin America, and  Reid Marsh , who left for
Barclays Plc. The appointments were disclosed today in an
internal Citigroup memo obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed
by spokesman  Mark Costiglio .  
 Walraven, 48, head of the investment bank’s Los Angeles
office and a senior mergers and acquisitions banker, will
relocate to New York and be responsible for management of the
group’s investment bankers,  Raymond J. McGuire , Citigroup’s head
of investment banking, said in the memo.  
 Beckmann will retain his role as head of New York-based
Citigroup’s automotive-banking franchise and will oversee the
industrials group’s corporate banking, McGuire said.  
 Walraven, a veteran banker to mining companies, advised
Phelps Dodge Corp. on its $26 billion sale to  Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc.  in 2007 and Alpha Natural Resources Inc. on
its $2.2 billion takeover of Foundation Coal Holdings Inc. last
year. He also advised Mentor Corp. last year on its $1.2 billion
sale to Johnson & Johnson.
