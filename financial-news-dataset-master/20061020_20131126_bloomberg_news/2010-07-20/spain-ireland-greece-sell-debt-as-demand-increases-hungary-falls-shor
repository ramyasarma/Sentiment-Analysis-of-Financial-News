             Spain, Ireland and Greece sold
almost 10 billion euros ($13 billion) of debt, with demand
rising for shorter-dated securities, on optimism the European
Union’s aid programs will contain the region’s fiscal crisis.  
 Hungary raised less than planned at a sale of three-month
bills, triggering a decline in the forint. Greece, which
activated an EU-led bailout package in May to avoid default,
auctioned 13-week bills, with investors bidding for 3.85 times
the amount on offer, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.64
times at a sale of 26-week securities a week ago. Spain and
Ireland also sold debt.  
 “Overall funding pressure is losing steam,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London.
“We expect the peripheral markets to enjoy even more potential
outperformance against the core. Obviously we still have this
event risk looming with the banks’ stress tests.”  
 Concern that Europe’s high-deficit countries wouldn’t be
able to meet their financing needs pushed yield premiums to
euro-era records and led the EU to design a 110 billion-euro
bailout for Greece and a broader 750 billion-euro backstop for
the region. The debt crisis prompted governments across Europe
to impose additional austerity measures to convince investors
they were serious about taming their deficits.  
 Rating Cut  
 Ireland, with the euro-region’s biggest budget shortfall,
sold 1.5 billion euros of six- and 10-year bonds today. Demand
for the shorter-maturity debt was 3.6 times the amount offered,
up from 3.1 times at a June auction. The auction came a day
after Moody’s Investors Service cut the country’s credit rating
one level to Aa2, citing the government’s “significant loss of
financial strength.”  
 The yield premium investors demand to hold Irish 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds, the region’s
benchmark government security, fell nine basis points to 275
basis points. The yield  difference , or spread, between Spain and
Germany narrowed three basis points to 173 basis points, the
least in a month. The Greek 10-year spread with bunds also fell.  
 Hungary was the one country that struggled to sell debt.
Three days after the International Monetary Fund suspended talks
over the new government’s refusal to impose more austerity,
Hungary sold 35 billion forint ($156 million) of three-month
bills, 10 billion less than planned. The yield rose to 5.47
percent, from 5.28 percent at a sale a week ago.  
 The forint weakened 0.2 percent to 290.11 per euro as of
1:31 p.m. in Budapest, after advancing 0.4 percent before the
auction.
