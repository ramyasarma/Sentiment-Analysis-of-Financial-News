             An area of thunderstorms and clouds
is becoming more likely to develop into a tropical cyclone in
the next two days, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  
 The weather system over the northern Leeward Islands, the
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic has a 40
percent chance of becoming a cyclone, the Center said today in
an  advisory  posted on its website at about 7:45 a.m. Miami time.
That’s up from a 30 percent chance six hours earlier.  
 The tropical wave is moving west-northwest at 5 miles (8
kilometers) to 10 miles an hour. That puts the system on a track
of heading toward the Gulf of Mexico, where  BP Plc  is trying to
clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 The June 1-Nov. 30 Atlantic hurricane season is typically
most active in August and September. This year, one named storm
has formed, Hurricane Alex, which made landfall in northeastern
Mexico on June 30.
