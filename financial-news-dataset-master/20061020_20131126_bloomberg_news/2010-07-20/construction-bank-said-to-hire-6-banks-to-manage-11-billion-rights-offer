             China Construction Bank Corp. , the
nation’s second-largest lender, hired six banks to help manage a
 rights offer  to raise as much as 75 billion yuan ($11.1 billion),
said four people with knowledge of the matter.  
 Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse Group
AG, Morgan Stanley, China International Capital Corp., Citic
Securities Co. and Construction Bank’s own investment banking
unit were appointed to handle the sale, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the information is private.  
 Construction Bank last month won shareholder approval to
issue as many as 0.7 shares for every 10 outstanding, or as many
as 630 million shares in Shanghai and about 15.7 billion in Hong
Kong. The Beijing-based company may complete the sale in October,
one of the people said.  
 The sale will bring to about $53.5 billion the amount of
money being raised by China’s five biggest state-owned banks
after they extended record loans last year to support a
government-led stimulus effort.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. 
this month sold $19.2 billion of shares in the world’s largest
initial public offering in four years.  
 Yu Baoyue , a Beijing-based press officer at Construction
Bank, wasn’t immediately available to comment. Officials at
Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, China
International Capital and Citic Securities declined to comment
or were unavailable.  
 FinanceAsia reported the hiring of the six banks on its
website earlier today.  
 Shares  of Construction Bank rose 2.1 percent to $HK6.41 at
the 12:30 p.m. trading break in Hong Kong. The stock added 0.6
percent in Shanghai.
