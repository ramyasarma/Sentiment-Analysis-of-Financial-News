             A third of U.K. companies and
organizations may miss a September deadline to disclose
information on their energy use, the consultants WSP Environment
& Energy said.  
 About 7,500 groups are at risk of paying fines of 5,000
pounds ($7,600) for failing to register by Sept. 30 for the
government’s so-called Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy
Efficiency Scheme, WSP said today in an e-mailed statement.
Fines then compound at 500 pounds a day, the consultant said.  
 About 20,000 companies, universities and councils will be
required to declare their energy consumption, according to the
government. About 5,000 of those will have to buy permits for
their carbon-dioxide emissions. They will be ranked each year in
a league, with income from the plan redistributed according to
carbon-cutting performance.  
 “Many companies remain unsure about the extent of their
obligations, and our forecasts show that there will be a
significant shortfall in registrations,” said  David Symons , a
director at London-based WSP. “A lack of awareness and
engagement among participants could prevent thousands of
companies from complying with the scheme on time.”  
 The plan covers companies that aren’t already included in
the European Union’s cap-and-trade program for emissions. Those
include  Tesco Plc , the country’s biggest supermarket chain, 
 Hilton Hotels Corp.  as well as the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge and local government authorities.
