             Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , the
world’s biggest custody bank, said second-quarter earnings more
than tripled on higher fees for overseeing and managing investor
assets.  
 Net income climbed to $658 million, or 54 cents a share,
from $176 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier, BNY
Mellon said today in a statement from New York. Analysts
expected earnings of 55 cents, according to the average of 11
estimates in a  Bloomberg survey . Earnings a year ago were hurt
by writedowns on securities backed by pools of home loans.  
 BNY Mellon joins State Street, the third-largest custody
bank, in reporting higher profit after a 12 percent gain in the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  of large U.S. stocks in the year
through June 30 lifted assets and fees. Income from lending cash
and securities is being squeezed by the Federal Reserve’s
decision to keep its main lending rate close to zero since
December 2008. That’s also lowered profit from fixed-income and
forced firms to waive fees on money-market funds.  
 “Fee revenue was on the light side,” said  Gerard Cassidy ,
an analyst with RBC Capital Markets in Portland, Maine.  
 While total fee revenue rose 1.8 percent, fees from
securities servicing fell 2 percent. Fees for asset and wealth
management rose 6.1 percent as assets under management grew 13
percent, helped by the acquisition of Insight Investment
Management, the third-largest manager of United Kingdom pension
funds, in the fourth quarter of 2009.  
 Expanding Abroad  
 BNY Mellon reported earnings before the start of regular
U.S. trading. Before today, the  shares  had fallen 8.3 percent to
$25.64 in New York Stock Exchange trading this year. State
Street is down 14 percent.  
 State Street said today that higher assets helped it post
second-quarter earnings of 87 cents a share, compared with a
$7.12 loss a year earlier. Fees earned for safekeeping assets
rose 20 percent from a year earlier to $957 million, the Boston-
based company said in a statement. Revenue increased to $2.3
billion.  
 Both companies have expanded abroad as banks are selling
units to raise capital. State Street in December agreed to buy
Mourant International Finance Administration in the U.K.’s
Channel Islands and the securities-servicing unit of Italy’s
Intesa Sanpaolo SpA. The two deals combined added more than $600
billion in custody assets.  
 ‘Deliver on Growth’  
 BNY Mellon, led by Chief Executive Officer  Robert P. Kelly ,
earlier this year agreed to buy PNC Financial Services Group
Inc.’s global-investment servicing business for $2.31 billion to
add hedge-fund and mutual-fund clients, and BHF Asset Servicing
GmbH to expand in Europe. The PNC purchase gave BNY Mellon an
additional $855 billion in custody assets.  
 Kelly “navigated around the financial crisis
successfully,” said Cassidy. “Now he will need to deliver on
growth.”  
 Custody banks earn fees from keeping records, tracking
performance and lending securities to institutional investors
including mutual funds, pensions and hedge funds.  
 BNY Mellon in the first quarter got 74 percent of its
revenue from providing  services , including custody, to investors
and 26 percent from asset management, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. For  State Street  the comparable numbers were 88
percent and 12 percent.
