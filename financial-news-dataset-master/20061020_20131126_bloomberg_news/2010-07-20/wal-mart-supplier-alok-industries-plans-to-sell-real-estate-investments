             Alok Industries Ltd. , an Indian
supplier of sportswear to  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  and Gap Inc.,
plans to dispose of its real estate investments to reduce debt
and raise money for working capital needs.  
 Alok Industries, India’ second-largest apparel and textile
manufacturer by market value, had spent about 15 billion rupees
($317 million) since October 2006 on four real-estate projects
in Mumbai, Chief Financial Officer  Sunil Khandelwal  said in a
phone interview today.  
 “The projects in which we invested are either at a stage
of completion or at a point at which we can cash in,”
Khandelwal said. “The investments back then were not done with
the intention to get into realty business but to capitalize on
the opportunity we saw then.”  
 The sale of the assets may help the company pay part of its
85 billion rupees debt set to cost as much as 5.75 billion
rupees in interest payments in the year ending March 31,
according to Khandelwal. The timing of the sale has not been
decided, he said.  
 Alok Industries declined 0.7 percent to 20.45 rupees at
2:27 p.m. in Mumbai trading. The stock has dropped 10.3 percent
this year compared with a 2.8 percent gain in the benchmark
 Sensitive Index  of the Bombay Stock Exchange.
