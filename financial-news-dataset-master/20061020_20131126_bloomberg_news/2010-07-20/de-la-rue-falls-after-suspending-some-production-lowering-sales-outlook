             De La Rue Plc  fell the most in 20
months in London trading after the world’s biggest printer of
paper money said it had suffered production problems at its U.K.
banknote printing factory.  
 De La Rue dropped 16 percent, the most since November 2008.
Some paper production had failed to meet quality standards “so
production and shipping of the specification has been
suspended,” the Basingstoke, England-based company said in a
statement today.  
 The company, which became the preferred supplier of
banknotes to the Bank of England in 2002 and bought the state’s
printing works a year later, said paper production and sales in
2010/2011 are now set to be “materially lower than originally
planned.”  
 The problems were at the company’s facility in Overton,
near Basingstoke, said Andrew Lorenz, an outside spokesman for
De La Rue. The company supplies more than 150 countries with
banknotes or paper to print their own notes, he said.  
 “Some of those countries’ quality specifications have not
been met,” Lorenz said.  
 De La Rue declined 147 pence, to close at 776.5 pence,
giving the company a market value of 768.8 million pounds ($1.17
billion).
