             South Africa’s rand snapped a three-
day decline against the dollar as speculation China’s government
will soon end policies to curb lending boosted investors’
sentiment toward higher-yielding assets from emerging markets.  
 The rand appreciated as much as 0.9 percent to 7.5855 per
dollar and traded 0.2 percent stronger at 7.6347 by 2:04 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.6519. The move erased
the rand’s slump to a 1 1/2-week low yesterday.  
 China will “back away” from tightening policies in the
housing market within three months as the economy faces a bigger
risk from a slowdown than inflation, according to International
Strategy & Investment Group. China’s policy cycle has troughed
and investors may see a “visible softening” in government’s
policy tone by the third quarter, said Morgan Stanley.  
 “With Asian equity markets opening higher this morning on
hopes that Chinese authorities will relax tightening measures in
the housing market, the rand has started to reverse some of its
losses,”  Standard Bank Group Ltd.  analysts  Michael Keenan  and
Nomvuyo Guma wrote in a client note today.  
 Government bonds rose in South Africa, with the benchmark
13.5 percent security due September 2015 rising 33 cents to
124.32 rand. The yield on the bond fell 7 basis points to 7.68
percent.  
 Money-market futures, used to gauge interest rate
expectations, dropped to a record low. Forward-rate agreements
for  three-month contracts for cash due in one month  fell 6 basis
points to 6.34 percent, the lowest since the central bank first
introduced its repurchase rate in 1999.
