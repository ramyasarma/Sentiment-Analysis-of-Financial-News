             DNZ Property Fund Ltd. , a New
Zealand commercial real estate investor, is seeking as much as
NZ$45 million ($32 million) from a share sale to reduce debt.  
 DNZ will aim to raise NZ$35 million from existing
shareholders and the balance from new institutional and retail
investors, it said in offer documents posted on its Web site.
The price will be determined by a book build process after the
offer closes on Aug. 4, it said.  
 Auckland-based DNZ, which owns about NZ$670 million of
property, said bank debt is projected to fall to about 42
percent of asset value by March 31 following the share issue and
some property sales. The company has negotiated a new, three-
year loan facility and has about NZ$68 million available for
future investment and development of existing projects, it said.  
 Goldman Sachs JBWere Ltd. is advising the company. The
share sale is not underwritten.
