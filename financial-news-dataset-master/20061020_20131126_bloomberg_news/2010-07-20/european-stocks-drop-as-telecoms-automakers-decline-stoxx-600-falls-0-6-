             European stocks declined, reversing
an earlier gain, as automakers and telecommunication shares
fell, and mining stocks pared their advance.  
 The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.6 percent to
244.8 at 10:52 a.m. in London, after earlier rising as much as
0.7 percent. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring
in September fell 0.7 percent.
