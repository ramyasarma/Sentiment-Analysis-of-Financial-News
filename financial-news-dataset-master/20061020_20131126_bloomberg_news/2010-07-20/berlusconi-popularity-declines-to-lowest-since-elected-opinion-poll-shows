             Confidence in Italian Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi  declined in July to the lowest since he won
his third election in 2008, an IPR Marketing poll showed.  
 Berlusconi’s standing dropped to 39 percent from 41 percent
in June, according to Rome-based IPR, which carries out a
monthly survey over the phone on 1,000 adults. The findings have
a 2.5 percent margin of error. This month’s poll was conducted
between July 17 and July 19.  
 Berlusconi, 73, is experiencing a “significant crisis of
confidence,” IPR said in a statement. The premier has clashed
with members of his own party, including lower-house speaker
 Gianfranco Fini , over a draft law to limit wiretapping and court
reporting that Berlusconi says is necessary to ensure that
Italians have the “freedom to talk on the phone.” Two
ministers and an undersecretary have resigned in the past two
months after becoming the focus of corruption investigations.  
 With three years left in his mandate, Berlusconi has yet to
appoint a political heir. Fini, 58, has been a key ally in
helping Berlusconi form three governments in the past 16 years.
