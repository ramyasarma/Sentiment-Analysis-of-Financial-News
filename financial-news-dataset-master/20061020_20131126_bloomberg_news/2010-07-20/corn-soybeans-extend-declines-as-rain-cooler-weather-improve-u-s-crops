             Corn declined for a second session
as cooler, wetter weather in the Midwest boosted prospects for
the crop in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and exporter.  
 Rain in the past 48 hours boosted topsoil moisture in dry
areas in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, and more precipitation
is expected from northern Illinois through Ohio in the next few
days, according to World Weather Inc. The moisture is easing the
threat of damage from unusually hot, dry weather that sent corn
to a six-month high last week.  
 “There have been some good rains across southern Iowa and
in Missouri and Illinois, and there’s more coming,” said  Larry Glenn , an analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter, Kansas.  
 Corn futures for December delivery dropped 6.5 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $3.875 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Yesterday, corn slid 3.3 percent, the biggest drop since May 28.
Futures are down 6.5 percent this year.  
 Corn also declined as speculative investors liquidated
positions after prices jumped 18 percent from June 29 through
July 16, touching a six-month high, said  Jon Marcus , the
president of Lakefront Futures and Options LLC in Chicago.  
 “Cooler heads prevailed regarding corn,” Marcus said.
“Everything looks really good corn-wise. They ran up corn too
high last week, and now they’re taking them back down.”  
 Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
