             Investments in hedge funds slowed by
30 percent in the second quarter, according to Hedge Fund
Research Inc., as stock markets fell on concerns about Europe’s
debt crisis and the possible slowing of global economic growth.  
 Investors added a net $9.5 billion to hedge funds in the
three months ended June, the Chicago-based research firm said
today in a statement, down from $13.7 billion in the prior
period. The industry’s assets declined 1.2 percent to $1.65
trillion in the second quarter.  
 Hedge funds posted an average  decline  of 2.5 percent in the
three months ended June as the Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  of
the largest U.S.-listed companies slumped 12 percent, the first
quarterly drop in a year. The index declined more than 1 percent
on June 30, when Moody’s Investors Service said it may downgrade
Spain’s credit rating.  
 About $8.8 billion went to hedge funds that oversee more
than $5 billion of investments. Those firms manage about 60
percent of the industry’s assets, according to Hedge Fund
Research.  
 Firms that invest money in hedge funds on behalf of clients
had $2 billion of withdrawals in the second quarter, the
research company said. Thirty-one percent of those companies
received net deposits.
