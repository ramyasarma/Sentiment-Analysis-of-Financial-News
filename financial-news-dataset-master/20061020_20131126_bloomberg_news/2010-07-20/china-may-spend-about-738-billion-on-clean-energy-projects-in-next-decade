             China, the world’s biggest polluter,
may spend about 5 trillion yuan ($738 billion) in the next
decade developing cleaner sources of energy to reduce emissions
from burning oil and coal, a government official said.  
 The government will submit plans to develop cleaner energy,
including nuclear power and gas from unconventional sources, in
2011 to 2020 to the State Council, or Cabinet, for approval,
Jiang Bing, head of the National Energy Administration’s
planning and development department, said in Beijing today.  
 China needs between 500 billion and 600 billion yuan
annually to develop energy-conservation and low-carbon
technologies, according to the government’s 2050 China Energy
and CO2 Emissions Report published last year. The country
attracted $11.5 billion of asset financing in clean-energy
technology in the second quarter, more than Europe and the U.S.
combined, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said on July 13.  
 “This does seem a very high figure on spending, although
it’s not clear how this has been worked out,” said  Barbara Hon ,
an analyst at China Everbright Securities in Hong Kong. “The
government is taking the issue of cleaner energy seriously for
the reasons of climate change, energy security. It’s already
meeting some of its targets for sectors like wind power well
ahead of schedule.”  
 China erected more wind turbines in 2009 than any other
country and may install a record 18 gigawatts of wind-power
capacity in 2010, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates show.  
 Reducing Coal’s Share  
 The world’s fastest-growing major economy will get more
than 11 percent of its energy from non-fossil fuels by 2015,
according to a statement released by the National Energy
Administration today. That compares with about 8 percent
currently, Jiang said at a media briefing.  
 The government wants about 15 percent of its energy to come
from non-fossil fuels by 2020. Coal-fired power plants accounted
for about 75 percent of the nation’s electricity generating
capacity last year.  
 Coal will meet 63 percent of the nation’s energy needs by
2015, down from 70 percent last year, as China increases
investment in clean energy, according to the energy
administration statement.  
 The country’s nuclear power generating capacity may reach
39 gigawatts by then, while its hydropower capacity may rise to
250 gigawatts, the administration said.  
 The share of natural gas in China’s energy supply may
increase to more than 8 percent by 2015 from 3.9 percent
currently, according to Jiang. Natural-gas consumption may reach
260 billion cubic meters by then, he said.
