             Spain will habilitate military air
traffic controllers to work at the country’s airports in
“exceptional situations,” Development Minister  Jose Blanco 
said today in an interview with radio station  Cadena Ser .  
 “Training military personal would be very quick and they
could easily stand in for air traffic controllers who are off
sick,” Blanco said during the interview.  
 Spain’s social security services are investigating whether
the 32 percent of civil air traffic controllers in Barcelona who
are on sick leave today are genuinely ill, or whether they are
performing an unofficial strike, Blanco said.  
 Spain, battling to reduce the euro region’s third-largest
budget deficit, cut traffic controllers’ average annual pay and
reduced their overtime allowance in February to help stop losses
at the national airport operator Aeropuertos Espanoles y
Navegacion Aerea SA before a possible share sale.  
 “If claims are false then they are breaking the law, which
means we can take legal action that may result in them losing
their jobs,” Blanco said.  
 USCA, the union for Spanish air controllers, denies that
its members are on an unofficial strike in order to put pressure
on Aena, as the airport operator is known, ahead of negotiations
regarding working conditions, the association said in a
statement posted on its  website .  
 A spokeswoman for USCA who declined to be identified by
name said that the government’s cuts mean that air controllers
are being forced to work longer hours with fewer technical
resources which has led to stress and illness among staff.
