             European regulators plan to detail
three scenarios when they publish the results of their stress
tests on the region’s banks this week, according to a document
by the  Committee of European Banking Supervisors .  
 Banks will publish their estimated Tier 1 capital ratios
under a benchmark for 2011, an adverse scenario and a third test
that includes “sovereign shock,” according to a template
prepared by  CEBS  for the banks and obtained by Bloomberg News.  
 In the last scenario, banks will publish their estimated
losses on sovereign debt held in their trading book as well as
“additional impairment losses on the banking book” that they
may suffer after a sovereign debt crisis, according to the
document dated July 15.  
 Under accounting rules, banks have to adjust the value of
sovereign bonds held in the trading book according to changes in
market prices, said  Konrad Becker , a financial analyst at Merck
Finck & Co. in Munich. For government debt held in the banking
book, lenders must write down their value only if there is
serious doubt about a state’s ability to repay its debt in full
or make interest payments, he said.  
 The sovereign-shock scenario doesn’t assume a European
nation will default, said a person with knowledge of the matter,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information
is private. Instead, it will assume that rising government-bond
yields will push up borrowing costs, spurring defaults in the
private sector that would lead to losses in lenders’ banking
books, said the person.  
 EU Stress Tests  
 CEBS coordinates national banking authorities and makes
policy recommendations to the European Union on regulation.
Spokeswoman Efstathia Bouli declined to comment.  
 EU regulators are examining the strength of 91 banks to
determine if they can survive potential losses from both a
recession and a decline in the value of their government bond
holdings. They are using the tests to reassure investors about
the health of financial institutions from  Germany ’s WestLB AG
and  Bayerische Landesbank  to Spanish savings banks as the debt
crisis pummels the bonds of  Greece ,  Spain  and  Portugal . The
results will be published at 6 p.m. Brussels time on July 23.  
 The banks may publish how much they will need to raise in
capital if their Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial
strength, falls below 6 percent under the sovereign scenario,
the draft shows. Lenders will also provide estimated loss rates
for their corporate and retail holdings for the adverse cases,
according to the template.  
 ‘Underwhelming’ Results  
 The test results are likely to be “underwhelming” because
they may require banks to raise less than half the 75 billion
euros ($97 billion) of fresh capital needed, Nomura Holdings
Inc. analysts said in a report yesterday. Hypo Real Estate
Holding AG, the commercial-property lender rescued by the German
government following the financial crisis, has failed the test,
two people familiar with the results said this week.  
 “Many people are adopting a dubious, or a sort of doubting
approach to the whole thing,” said Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Chief Global Economist  Jim O’Neill  in a Bloomberg Radio
interview today.  
 It’s difficult to apply the same tests to banks ranging
from Spain’s “top class”  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA  to
Germany’s state-owned Landesbanken, which are tools of the
country’s postwar development, he said. In terms of the European
debt crisis, it would have been better if regulators had
concentrated on testing Spanish banks, he said.
