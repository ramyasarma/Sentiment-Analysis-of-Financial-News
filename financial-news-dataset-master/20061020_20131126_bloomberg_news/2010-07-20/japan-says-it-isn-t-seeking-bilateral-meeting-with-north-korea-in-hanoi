             Japan said it isn’t seeking a
bilateral meeting of foreign ministers with North Korea during
an Asian security summit in Hanoi this week.  
 Foreign Minister  Katsuya Okada  “has no intention at this
point” of meeting with his North Korean counterpart, Pak Ui Chun,
Hidenobu Sobashima, deputy press secretary at the ministry told
reporters in the Vietnamese capital today. They might have a
chance to meet naturally during the summit, he said.  
 Japan is part of the six-party forum that is seeking to
persuade North Korea to resume talks on dismantling its nuclear
weapons program. South Korea has ruled out any resumption unless
North Korea apologizes for the March 26 sinking of the South
Korean warship Cheonan, which an international panel blamed on
 Kim Jong Il ’s regime.  
 The six-party talks, also involving China, Russia and the
U.S., haven’t convened since December 2008. Japan proposed a
bilateral meeting with North Korea, Nikkei English News reported
earlier today, without citing a source for the article.  
 North Korea on July 10 expressed a willingness to return to
disarmament talks, a day after the United Nations Security
Council adopted a statement falling short of blaming the country
for the Cheonan attack. South Korea’s Foreign Minister  Yu Myung Hwan  on July 18 dismissed the North Korean overture as a ploy to
divert attention from the sinking.  
 North Korea withdrew from the six-party process after UN
sanctions imposed in response to missile tests. The country
exploded a second nuclear device in May 2009 after conducting
its first test in 2006.
