             Copper rose for a second day in
London on the longest streak of inventory declines in more than
a year and on gains by Chinese equities that fueled optimism
about the demand outlook.  
 Stockpiles  of copper tracked by the London Metal Exchange
shrank for a 23rd day today.  Chinese shares  rallied for a second
day on prospects that the government may relax tightening
measures as the economy slows. Copper fell for three months in a
row through June on concern about efforts to curb growth in
China, the world’s biggest user of the metal.  
 “Stronger Chinese equities suggest that the prospects for
the Chinese economy are improving,”  David Thurtell , a Citigroup
Inc. analyst in London, said by telephone. “Copper stocks keep
falling.”  
 Copper for delivery in three months added $75.50, or 1.2
percent, to $6,585.50 a metric ton at 9:52 a.m. on the LME.
Futures for September delivery gained 1.2 percent to $2.973 a
pound on the Comex in New York.  
 All of the six main metals traded on the LME climbed, led
by zinc. Copper producer Xstrata Plc and other mining companies
posted eight of the 10 biggest advances in the U.K. benchmark
 FTSE 100 Index  of equities.  
 40-Session Run  
 LME-monitored copper inventories fell to 419,600 tons, the
lowest level since Nov. 18. The current streak of drops is the
longest since a 40-session run that ended on July 2, 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stockpiles are down 16
percent this year and on course for the first annual drop since
2004.  
 Bookings  to remove copper from LME warehouses jumped 5.7
percent to 33,050 tons. Immediate-delivery metal’s discount to
the three-month price, the so-called contango, narrowed to
$15.25 yesterday from $16.25 in the previous session and $21 a
week ago.  
 Prices also gained today as the dollar weakened, making
metals priced in the currency cheaper in terms of other monies.
The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the greenback’s
strength, lost as much as 0.4 percent.  
 Figures released last week showed that Chinese economic
growth slowed to 10.3 percent in the second quarter and the
consumer price index dropped 0.6 percent in June from May,
signaling a diminishing risk of overheating. Industrial output
in China rose 13.7 percent in June, less than all but one of 27
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 More Demand, Limited Supply  
 “Certainly last week’s GDP data showed a moderation in
growth, but more importantly the CPI fell, which gives Beijing
more scope to take its foot off the brake,” Citigroup’s
Thurtell said. “That is good for metals demand.”  
 Growing demand and limited supplies of refined and scrap
copper will support prices, Laredo, Texas-based researcher
Harbor Intelligence said in a monthly report e-mailed yesterday.
Usage will outpace supply by 125,000 tons this year, with the
deficit widening to 180,000 tons next year, it said.  
 “Prices have exited the correction/bear-market phase, and
we should expect higher prices for the rest of the year and
early 2011,” Harbor Intelligence said. Comex copper will
average $3.28 a pound ($7,231 a ton) this year before rising to
$3.70 next year, the report shows.  
 Still, a report due at 1:30 p.m. London time probably will
show that housing starts in the U.S., the second-largest copper
consumer, fell in June to the lowest level of the year,
economists said. Work began on 577,000 houses, down 2.7 percent
from May and the fewest since December, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Construction accounts for a quarter of copper demand,
according to the  Copper Development Association .  
 Aluminum for three-month delivery on the LME rose 0.2
percent to $1,976 a ton, lead gained 1.3 percent to $1,798.50 a
ton and nickel advanced 1 percent to $18,980 a ton. Zinc climbed
2 percent to $1,844 a ton and tin added 0.2 percent to $17,975 a
ton.
