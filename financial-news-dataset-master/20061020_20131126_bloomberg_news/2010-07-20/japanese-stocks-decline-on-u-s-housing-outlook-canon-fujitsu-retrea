             Japanese  stocks  fell for a third day
after U.S. home-builder confidence dropped more than forecast,
stoking concern the economic recovery will falter.  
 Sony Corp. , the maker of Bravia televisions, sank 2.8
percent. Fujitsu Ltd., Japan’s biggest computer-services
provider, slipped 1.7 percent after International Business
Machines Corp. reported sales that missed analysts’ estimates.
Kyocera Corp., a semiconductor maker, fell 2.1 percent after
Texas Instruments Inc., the second-largest U.S. chipmaker,
reported profit and sales that were lower than forecasts.  
 “The momentum of the economic recovery dropped in the
U.S.” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee about $6 billion
at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “I feel that
investors overreacted to the slowdown.”  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 1.2 percent to 9,300.46
as of the close in Tokyo. The Topix lost 1 percent to 832.26,
with about two stocks falling for each that advanced. Japan’s
market was closed yesterday when the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
fell 0.8 percent.  
 The Topix has retreated 8.3 percent this year, compared
with drops of 3.9 percent for the S&P 500 and 3 percent for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Topix are valued at 16.2
times estimated  earnings , compared with 13 times for the S&P 500
and 11.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.2 percent
after losing as much as 0.5 percent today. In New York yesterday,
the index rose 0.6 percent as optimism about earnings from
technology and energy companies overshadowed a drop in financial
shares.

 Sony lost 2.8 percent to 2,336 yen and Fujitsu sank 1.7
percent to 581 yen, after International Business Machines Corp.
the world’s biggest computer-services company, reported sales
that missed analysts’ estimates.  
 Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s biggest carmaker, slid 2.6
percent to 3,055 yen. Nissan Motor Co., an automaker that gets
more than 75 percent of its revenue outside Japan, fell 2.4
percent to 613 yen. Makers of electronics and cars were the
heaviest drags on the Topix among the broader gauge’s 33
industry groups.  
 The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
confidence index dropped to 14 this month, the lowest level
since April 2009, from 16 in June, data from the Washington-
based group showed yesterday. Builders in the U.S. turned more
pessimistic in July than forecast, a sign the expiration of a
government tax credit will depress home construction.  
 “There’s concern about a deterioration of the U.S.
economy,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based
SMBC Friend Securities Co.  
 U.S. Economy  
 Kyocera slipped 2.1 percent to 7,180 yen and  Tokyo Electron
Ltd. , the world’s second-largest maker of semiconductor
equipment, declined 2.9 percent to 4,680 yen, after Texas
Instruments Inc., the second-largest U.S. chipmaker, reported
profit and sales that fell short of analysts’ estimates. Kyocera
and Tokyo Electron were the second- and third-largest
contributors to a drop of the Nikkei 225 index.  
 “Concerns are mounting globally about a double-dip
recession,” said  Koichi Kurose , chief strategist in Tokyo at
Resona Bank Ltd., which manages about $57 billion. “Prices for
risk assets will stay at the bottom.”
