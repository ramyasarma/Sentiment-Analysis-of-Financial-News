             South Africa’s parliamentary
portfolio committee on finance approved proposed laws aimed at
protecting the independence of the central bank. The laws are
opposed by several of the bank’s shareholders.  
 The government unveiled the draft legislation on May 3,
saying it was needed to stop shareholders from exercising undue
influence over the South African Reserve Bank and disrupting its
operations.  
 The finance committee approved the South African Reserve
Bank Amendment Bill without making any changes, its chairman
Thaba Mufamadi said at a meeting in Cape Town today.
Shareholders including Michael Duerr and Mario Pretorius, who
have been pushing for more influence over the bank and its
board, had urged lawmakers to reject the legislation, saying it
would give management unfettered powers.  
 The Reserve Bank is one of nine central banks around the
world that have private investors who are allowed to own a
maximum of 10,000 shares that entitle them to 50 votes at annual
general meetings. They receive a fixed dividend of 10 cents a
share.  
 The new law, which will now be referred to Parliament for
approval, aims to prevent shareholders from controlling voting
rights through relatives and close associates. It also proposes
increasing the size of the bank’s board to 15 from 14 members
and raising the number of board members appointed by the
government to four from three.
