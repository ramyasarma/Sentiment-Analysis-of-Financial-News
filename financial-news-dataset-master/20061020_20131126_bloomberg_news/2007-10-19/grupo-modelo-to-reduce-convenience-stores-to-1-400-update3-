             Grupo Modelo SAB (GMODELOC) , Mexico's largest
brewer, plans to reduce the number of Extra convenience stores
it runs to about 1,400 this year from 2,043 at the end of 2006
to boost profit at its retail unit.  
 Modelo, the maker of Corona beer, intends to close about
350 stores this year, open 200 new locations and convert 500
into stores that will sell only beer, Chief Executive Officer
Carlos Fernandez said today on a conference call with analysts.  
 ``We prefer to focus on profitability,'' Fernandez said.
``As soon as we have a healthy base, we will continue to focus
on growth.''  
 Modelo started its Extra convenience-store chain to tap
into rapid growth of retail outlets in  Mexico  and give the
company a platform to sell more beer. Fomento Economico Mexicano
SAB, the country's second-largest beer company, owns the leading
convenience-store chain in Mexico, with 5,097 Oxxo stores at the
end of June.  
 Fernandez said he expects the Extra chain to post break-
even earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization -- a measure of cash flow known as ebitda -- at the
end of 2008.  
 Modelo said its beer exports may rise in the ``mid-single
digit'' range on a percentage basis in 2008, depending on how
much the company increases prices, Jose Pares, vice president of
international markets, said on the call.  
 Exports This Year  
 Modelo said its exports may rise 5 percent in volume this
year, lower than a 16 percent gain in 2006. Part of the slowdown
stemmed from a U.S. price increase earlier this year, Pares
said.  
 Exports account for about a third of Modelo's sales by
volume and 44 percent of revenue. In the third quarter, export
volumes rose 3 percent from a year ago to 4.38 million
hectoliters, Modelo said in its earnings report yesterday.  
 ``Tough competitive environment in the U.S. caused export
volumes to come well below our original thoughts,'' Tufic Salem,
an analyst at Credit Suisse, said today in a report. Salem said
he had originally forecast export volume growth of 9 percent for
the quarter before revising it down to 4 percent.  
 Modelo said third-quarter net income fell to 2.19 billion
pesos ($200 million) as the company shared half its profit from
a U.S. beer export venture formed with Fairport, New York-based
Constellation brands this year.  
 Sales increased 24 percent to 18.4 billion pesos in the
quarter, and operating income rose 21 percent to 5.16 billion
pesos.  
 Modelo fell 2.26 pesos, or 4.2 percent, to 51.72 pesos at
3:07 p.m. (4:07 p.m.  New York  time) today in Mexico stock
exchange trading. The stock is down 14 percent this year.
