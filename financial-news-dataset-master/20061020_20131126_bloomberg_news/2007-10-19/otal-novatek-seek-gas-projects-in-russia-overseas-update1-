             Total SA (FP)  and OAO Novatek, Russia's
largest independent natural-gas producer, agreed today to seek
joint projects in Russia and overseas.  
 Total and Novatek will form working groups to define the
scope of potential projects, Pierre Nerguararian, the head of
Total's Russian unit, said by e-mail.  
 State-run OAO Gazprom approved the cooperation agreement,
Tarko-Sale, Russia-based Novatek said in an e-mailed statement.
Gazprom, the world's largest natural-gas company, holds a 20
percent stake in the smaller producer.  
 Novatek shares gained 1.3 percent to 132.57 rubles today in
Moscow, after rising as much as 3 percent. Novatek sells all of
its natural gas output domestically, exporting some condensate,
which is similar to light crude oil, and refined fuel.  
 Total is seeking to expand in  Russia , which holds 26
percent of world's natural-gas reserves, after setbacks over the
past two years. Novatek decided against selling shares to Total,
 Europe 's third-largest oil company, in 2005, while state-run oil
company OAO Rosneft dropped it from the Vankor oil project.  
 Gazprom tapped Total in July as the largest foreign partner
in the Shtokman project, which may hold as much as 3.7 trillion
cubic meters of gas, more than triple Europe's consumption last
year. Total is in talks with the Russian government about
changes to its development plan for the Arctic Kharyaga project,
which regulators had criticized as behind schedule.
