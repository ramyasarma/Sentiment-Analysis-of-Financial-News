Italy’s Constitutional Court has
postponed a hearing to rule on the validity of a law granting
immunity to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and other senior
officials, Ansa news agency said, citing the court’s president.  The court had been scheduled to issue its ruling on Dec.
14, the same day Berlusconi’s government could fall in
confidence votes in parliament. The Rome-based tribunal has
instead decided to hold the hearing “in a more tranquil
climate” in January, Ansa said, citing court President Ugo De
Siervo.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
