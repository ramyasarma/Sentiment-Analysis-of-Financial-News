Embraer SA , the world’s fourth-
largest aircraft maker, created a new defense and security unit
that the company forecasts will have sales of more than 1.5
billion reais next year.  Embraer’s defense division accounted for 130.3 million
reais ($76 million), of third-quarter revenue, or 7.1 percent of
the total, up from 5.7 percent the year before.  The Brazilian company produces the light attack aircraft
known as Super-Tucano and is developing a military transport,
dubbed KC-390, that should have its first flight in 2014.
Embraer also manufactures jets for government personnel
transport and for surveillance, mostly based on its commercial
jet platforms.  The unit “will strengthen in the next few years, not only
by providing Brazil’s needs, but also through exports,” Chief
Financial Officer  Luiz Carlos Aguiar , who will run the new
business, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Embraer  fell  0.9 percent to 12.16 reais in Sao Paulo
trading at 9:33 a.m. New York time. The shares have risen 28
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
