Coffee futures in New York advanced
the most in three weeks as unusually wet weather threatened
crops in Colombia, the second-largest grower of arabica beans.  A La Nina weather pattern will continue to bring above-
average rain to Colombia into next year, the government’s
meteorological agency said. Storms in recent weeks caused
flooding and mudslides, damaging the nation’s coffee crop, the
agency said yesterday. Before today, futures in New York were up
50 percent this year.  “The primary concern right now is dealing with Colombia’s
harvest,” said Mu Li, a commodity analyst at CPM Group in New
York. “Coffee prices are definitely going to stay elevated
until the end of this year and the first two quarters of next
year.”  Arabica coffee for March delivery rose 5.2 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $2.0975 a pound at 11:47 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York, heading for the first gain in four days. A close at
that price would be the biggest gain since Nov. 18 and leave the
contract up 2.4 percent for the week.  A shortage of high-quality arabica coffee has led to
“precariousness of the supply/demand balance,” the
International Coffee Organization said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
