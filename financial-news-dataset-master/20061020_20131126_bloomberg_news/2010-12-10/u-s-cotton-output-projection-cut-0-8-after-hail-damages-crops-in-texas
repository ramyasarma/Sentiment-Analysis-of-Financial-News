The U.S. cotton crop will be 0.8
percent smaller than forecast a month ago, the government said,
as hail damage to plants in Texas may lower yields.  Production  will total 18.27 million bales in the harvest
that is just finishing, down from the 18.42 million projected in
November, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a
report, lowering its estimate for the second straight month. The
previous harvest totaled 12.19 million bales. Eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News were expecting 18.49 million bales.  “The yield may be lower in some areas,” accounting for
the decline, Sharon Johnson, a senior analyst at Penson Futures
in Atlanta, said earlier this week.  Cotton futures surged 80 percent this year before today as
global supplies shrank and demand from mills increased,
especially from China, the world’s biggest user. Yesterday, the
March contract jumped the exchange limit of 4 cents, or 3
percent, to $1.3595 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the
highest price since Nov. 16.  In October, a hailstorm damaged crops in Texas, the biggest
U.S. producing state.  The U.S., the world’s largest exporter, may ship 15.75
million bales in the marketing year that began Aug. 1, unchanged
from last month’s forecast, the USDA said. That compares with 12
million bales in the previous year.  U.S. stockpiles  on July 31 will total 1.9 million bales,
down from last month’s estimate of 2.2 million, according to the
report. A year earlier, inventories were 2.95 million bales.  A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  World output  will be 115.5 million bales, up from last
month’s forecast of 115.2 million. Global use will be 116.3
million bales, down from the November projection of 116.8
million, the USDA said. Ending stocks will be 43.4 million
bales, up from the previous estimate of 42.2 million, the agency
said.  The government will update its supply and demand forecasts
on Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
