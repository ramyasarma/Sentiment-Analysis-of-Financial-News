The Dutch public prosecutor said a
16-year-old boy admitted attacking the websites of MasterCard
Inc. and Visa Inc. in support of WikiLeaks.  The suspect, who is from The Hague, will be held in custody
for 13 days, the prosecutor said in a release on its website
today. His name wasn’t released.  The Dutch public prosecutor’s website has also been
“completely down for a short period,” today, following a cyber
attack, the agency said in a separate  statement . The attack was
probably related to the teen’s apprehension, according to the
statement.  The detention of the 16-year-old comes as the U.S. Justice
Department is examining cyber attacks that have been blamed on
WikiLeaks supporters.  MasterCard ’s website was slowed this week
by a flood of traffic in a denial-of-service attack after the
company blocked payments to WikiLeaks via its network.  “Two weeks is a standard period in which to hold a person
in custody,” whether he be a minor or not, said Wim de Bruin,
a spokesman for the prosecution. “After that, the prosecution
will again decide whether to keep him in custody or release
him.”  MasterCard, the world’s second-biggest payments processor,
and London-based Visa Europe Ltd. said on Dec. 7 they were
suspending use of their networks by WikiLeaks after the
organization on Nov. 28 began publishing secret U.S. military
and State Department documents online.  Visa  took steps to restore its website to full operation
after experiencing heavier than normal traffic. Amazon.com Inc.
and EBay Inc.’s PayPal unit also recently cut off access to
WikiLeaks. PayPal said it was taking additional steps today as
it sustained cyber attacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
