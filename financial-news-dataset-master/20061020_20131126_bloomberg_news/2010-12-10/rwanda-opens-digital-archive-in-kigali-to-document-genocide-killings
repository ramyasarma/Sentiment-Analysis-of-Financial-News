Rwanda has opened a digital archive
of documents, photos and recordings relating to the 1994
genocide that saw 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus
killed in about 100 days.  “This center will serve as testimony to the world of what
leadership is able to do in a bad or good way,” Prime Minister
 Bernard Makuza  said at the opening of the facility in Kigali,
the capital, today.  The Genocide Archive Rwanda has more than 1,500 audio-
visual recordings and 20,000 documents and photographs,
according to a statement handed to reporters at the  Kigali
Genocide Memorial .  The mass murders left about one-tenth of the population of
the East African Nation dead. The killings were triggered by the
death in a plane crash of President  Juvenal Habyarimana , an
ethnic Hutu. Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira was also on
the plane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
