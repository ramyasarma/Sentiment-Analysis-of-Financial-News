The U.S. government posted a wider
budget deficit in November as spending swelled compared with the
same time last year when a shift in the timing of payments for
programs like Medicare and Social Security damped outlays.  The  deficit  was $150.4 billion last month, exceeding the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
compared with $120.3 billion in November 2009, according to the
Treasury Department’s budget statement released in Washington.
For the first two months of the 2011 fiscal year, the shortfall
narrowed to $290.8 billion from $296.7 billion in the same
period last year as revenue improved.  Receipts climbed 12 percent last month as the recovery in
the job market began boosting individual tax payments. An
agreement by President  Barack Obama  and congressional
Republicans including extending Bush-era tax cuts and jobless
benefits may boost the deficit this year and next.  “Were starting to see some positive revenue growth,” said
 Gary Thayer , chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in
St. Louis. “We are seeing a healthier economy.”  Stocks held earlier gains as reports showed consumer
confidence increased more the forecast this month and the trade
deficit dropped to a nine-month low in October. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent to 1,239.59 at 2:41 p.m. in
New York.  Confidence, Trade  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of  consumer sentiment  rose to 74.2 from 71.6 at the end of
November. A Commerce Department report showed the U.S.  trade
deficit  shrank to $38.7 billion from $44.6 billion in September
as a weaker dollar and growing economies overseas propelled
 exports  to a two-year high.  A survey of 27 economists conducted by Bloomberg News
projected a budget deficit of $138 billion in November. The non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office, in a forecast issued Dec.
7, estimated the deficit would total $142 billion.  Total revenue rose 12 percent to $149 billion in November.  Individual income receipts in the first two months of the
current fiscal year rose 24 percent to $135.7 billion. Corporate
income tax receipts were a negative $7.5 billion.  Total spending rose 18 percent in November to $299.4
billion. Payments that would normally have occurred on Nov. 1,
2009, a Sunday, were instead pushed into October, depressing
last year’s total and making this year jump in comparison.  More Spending  Spending by the Defense Department rose to $123.2 billion
for the fiscal year to date. Outlays by the Social Security
Administration rose to $127.3 billion.  Spending by the Department of Health and Human Services,
which administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, increased
to $144.5 billion.  Senate leaders this week released an agreement crafted by
the White House and Republicans to sustain Bush-era tax rates
through 2012, set the estate tax at the lowest rate in 80 years,
extend jobless aid and cut payroll taxes by 2 percentage points.  Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York projected
the compromise will cost the Treasury about $850 billion, with
the biggest impact coming in fiscal years 2011 and 2012. In a
research note today they forecast the budget shortfall will
reach a record $1.5 trillion this year and $1.2 trillion the
next compared with $1.3 trillion in the 2010 fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
