U.S. stocks erased gains as
financial companies led losses in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and  falling  commodities prices wiped out an advance by
raw-materials producers.  The  S&P 500  advanced less than 0.1 percent to 1,233.47 at
10:14 a.m. New York time after climbing as much as 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
