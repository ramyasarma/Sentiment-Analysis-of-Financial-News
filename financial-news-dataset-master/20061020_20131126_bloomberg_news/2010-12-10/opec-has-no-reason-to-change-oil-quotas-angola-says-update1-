There is no reason for the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to change quotas
at a meeting in Ecuador tomorrow, Angola’s oil minister said.  “There is no reason to change production,” Angolan Oil
Minister  Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos  said in Quito, where
OPEC ministers will gather. “The situation is stable right
now,” and oil at $90 a barrel makes up for a weak dollar.  “We had a $70-to-$80 range that was stable but up to $90 is
comfortable,” the minister said. The price increase makes up for
the exchange rate differences between the dollar and the euro
and for higher commodity prices, “so now we have an equilibrium
in the oil prices.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
