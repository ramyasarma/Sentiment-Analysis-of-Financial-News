Africa Israel USA , owner of the New
York Times’ former headquarters in Times Square, said Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer  Richard Marin  left the company after
two years at the helm.  “The company and Mr. Marin have decided to go their
separate ways and we wish him well,” Laurie Golub, general
counsel of Africa Israel USA, said in an e-mailed statement.  Tamir Kazaz, the developer’s former chief financial
officer, will replace Marin as CEO with “the full support of
the management team,” according to Golub’s statement. The
company doesn’t plan to name a new chairman.  The Wall Street Journal reported Marin’s departure earlier
today.  Africa Israel, a unit of Israeli billionaire  Lev Leviev ’s
Africa Israel Investments Ltd., made its highest-profile
acquisitions just before the onset of the credit crunch in 2007.
The company bought the former New York Times building for $525
million and Manhattan’s Clock Tower building for $200 million.  Leviev said in August 2009 that the company’s U.S.
investments were “our biggest mistake” and that Africa Israel
would seek to restructure about $2 billion of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
