California  revenue was $1.3 billion
in November, or 19.4 percent higher than estimated in its
recently enacted budget, Controller  John Chiang  said.  The better-than-expected receipts mean the most populous
U.S. state will “not face an immediate cash crisis this fiscal
year,” Chiang said in an e-mailed statement today.  Corporate-tax revenues for November were $263.8 million
better than estimates, according to a  summary  the controller
released. Retail sales and use taxes were $366.7 million or 11.4
percent above expectations, while personal income-tax revenues
came in $629.2 million or 22.6 percent above estimates,  Some of the increase was from accelerated revenue that
would otherwise have arrived during December, Chiang said in the
statement. He urged lawmakers to adopt budget solutions by July
that end the state’s reliance on short-term cash-flow borrowing.
California’s budget gap may widen to $28.1 billion over the next
18 months, Governor-elect Jerry Brown said on Dec. 8.  “Without an honest, on-time budget, we could see a multi-
billion dollar cash problem in the summer of 2011,” Chiang said
in the statement.  Total receipts for November were $6.9 billion compared with
$5.6 billion for the same month of 2009, according to the
month’s cash receipts  statement . Receipts for the fiscal year so
far, July 1 through Nov. 30, came in at $33 billion versus $29.7
billion in the same period of 2009.  Total state spending for the fiscal year to date was $43.8
billion as compared with $42.3 billion in the same period last
year, according to the statement. California relied on $10.7
billion in temporary loans to help make up the difference
between revenues and expenses, the statement showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
