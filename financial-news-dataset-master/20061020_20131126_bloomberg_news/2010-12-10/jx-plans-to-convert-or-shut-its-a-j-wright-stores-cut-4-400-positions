TJX Cos.  plans to cut 4,400 jobs as
it converts 91 A.J. Wright stores into T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or
HomeGoods stores and closes the brand’s remaining 71 locations.  The goal is to concentrate  management  and financial
resources on larger, more profitable businesses, the Framingham,
Massachusetts-based discount retailer said today in a statement.
Almost half of the positions to be eliminated are part-time.  TJX anticipates that all 162 A.J. Wright stores,
concentrated in the northeastern U.S., will be shut by mid-
February, at a cost of about $150 million to $170 million,
including asset impairment and severance  expenses . The company
said it expects that converting the 91 stores will take about
eight weeks after the Wright closing.  T.J. Maxx and Marshalls attracted moderate-income shoppers
during the recession, giving TJX confidence that those two
chains can win sales from consumers who shopped at A.J. Wright,
Chief Executive Officer  Carol Meyrowitz  told analysts today on a
conference call.  “Management may want to focus its energy on the core
businesses and Europe, and viewed A.J. Wright as a
distraction,”  Howard Tubin , an RBC Capital Markets analyst in
New York, wrote today in a note to clients. He rates TJX as
“outperform.”  The  shares  rose 7 cents to $45.03 at 12:58 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had gained 23
percent this year before today.  Less Affluent Consumers  TJX is shutting A.J. Wright 12 years after starting the
chain to attract consumers less affluent than its T.J. Maxx and
Marshalls shoppers. The brand generated  sales  of $779.8 million
in the year that ended in January. The company is closing the
Wright distribution centers in Indiana and Massachusetts.  The unit that operates T.J. Maxx and Marshalls locations
has the potential for 2,300 to 2,400 stores, 300 to 400 more
than TJX previously estimated, Meyrowitz said in today’s
statement.  The Marmaxx division operated 1,751 stores in the U.S. as
of Oct. 30, including 919 T.J. Maxx and 832 Marshalls venues,
according to a Nov. 16 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
