Representative Ron Paul, a Texas
Republican who next month will take control of the House
subcommittee that oversees the Federal Reserve, said today that
he will “not really, not right up front” push for an end to
the U.S. central bank.  “But obviously that’s the implication,” Paul said in a
Bloomberg Television interview on “In the Loop” with Betty Liu.
Paul said he was talking about a “transition.”  Paul, author of the book “End the Fed,” said he will
emphasize “oversight” of the central bank.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
