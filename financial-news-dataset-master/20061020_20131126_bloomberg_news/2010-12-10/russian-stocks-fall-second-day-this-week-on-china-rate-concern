Russian stocks slipped for the
second day this week as oil fell and investors speculated China
will raise interest rates, curbing growth and damping demand for
raw materials.  OAO Polymetal , the country’s largest gold producer, plunged
6.5 percent.  OAO Severstal , the nation’s largest steelmaker,
lost 1 percent. Oil producer OAO Lukoil lost 0.6, helping push
the Micex Index 0.3 percent lower to 1,656.34 by the 6:45 p.m.
close in Moscow, paring this week’s gain to 0.4 percent.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, slid as much as 0.8
percent to $87.68 a barrel. Chinese data due tomorrow may signal
inflation accelerated, prompting the world’s fastest-growing
economy to increase rates.  “It is expected that China will impose additional curbs on
lending and speculative growth this weekend,” said  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib Financial Corp., in an e-
mailed report today.  OAO Aeroflot , Russia’s biggest airline, dropped 3.9 percent
after billionaire Alexander Lebedev agreed to sell 44 million
shares in the company, Interfax reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
