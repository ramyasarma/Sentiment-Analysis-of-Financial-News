Supporters of a new U.S.-Russia
nuclear-arms treaty negotiated by President Barack Obama’s
administration said they have the 67 votes needed for Senate
ratification as two more Republicans announced their backing.  Mark Helmke, a spokesman for Indiana Senator Dick Lugar,
the leading Republican supporter of the New Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty, or New START, said today that enough senators
are prepared to vote for the pact’s ratification. The treaty
needs 67 of the 100 Senate votes to be approved.  Maine’s two Republican senators, Susan Collins and Olympia
Snowe, said in separate statements that they supported
ratification.  “We’ve got enough Republican support to pass the treaty,”
Helmke said, declining to name backers because some haven’t
registered their support publicly. “We are hopeful that Senator
Reid sets the schedule as soon as possible,” he said, referring
to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
