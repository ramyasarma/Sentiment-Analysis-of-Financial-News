Fiat SpA  has reached an agreement
with Confindustria, Italy’s employers’ association, over its
Mirafiori plant, Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said.  “Fiat-Chrysler created a newco,” for Mirafiori, he told
reporters today upon arriving at the U.S.-Italy council meeting
in New York.  The agreement, which will work outside of the metalworkers’
union contract “will last until a new automotive contract will
be signed by Confindustria, Fiat and Federmeccanica,” the
metalworkers union, Marchionne said.  If the union rejects the agreement, Fiat will invest
somewhere else, he said.  Fiat, based in Turn, Italy, last year acquired a 20 percent
stake in Chrysler Group LLC, the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
automaker. Marchionne is CEO of both automakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
