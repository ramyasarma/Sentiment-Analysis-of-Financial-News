Credit Agricole SA, France’s third-
largest bank by market value, may sell stakes in private equity
funds valued at about 500 million euros ($663 million), three
people with knowledge of the matter said.  The bank has approached potential bidders for the assets,
which include undrawn and drawn commitments in mid-sized
leveraged buyout funds in France, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the talks are private.  Anne-Sophie Gentil , a spokeswoman for Credit Agricole, declined to comment.  The lender follows Citigroup Inc. and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc  in trying to shrink its private equity
holdings as banks face tighter regulation and more stringent
capital requirements for their riskiest assets. Paris-based
Credit Agricole manages about 3 billion euros of investments in
leveraged buyout, venture capital, mezzanine and infrastructure
funds, according to its website.  Investment firms raised a record $22.7 billion last year to
buy stakes in private equity funds, according to London-based
research firm Preqin Ltd. Lexington Partners Inc., Coller
Capital Ltd. and Axa SA’s private equity division are among
firms raising so-called secondaries funds.  Credit Agricole Private Equity acquired in August a 69
percent stake in Exclusive Networks Group, a distributor of
security systems based in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris. It
also bought a stake in Vivalto Sante, a Brittany-based operator
of private clinics, in 2009, according to the unit’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
