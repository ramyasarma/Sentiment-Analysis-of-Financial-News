AirAsia X Sdn. , the long-haul
affiliate of Southeast Asia’s biggest discount carrier, may sell
shares in Europe and Asia as early as next year as it adds new
planes.  “We could easily sell shares next year,” Chief Executive
Officer  Azran Osman Rani  said in an interview in Tokyo today.
The European listing may be in London, while Asian shares may be
sold in Hong Kong, Singapore or Malaysia, he said. The carrier
may wait until 2012 for the offering as it has over $100 million
in cash, he said.  AirAsia X is planning to roughly triple its fleet to 35
planes over the next six years as it adds more international
destinations, Osman Rani said. The airline yesterday began
flights to Tokyo from its Kuala Lumpur hub, adding to services
to London and Australia.  The carrier, which flew more than 1 million passengers in
2009, is partly owned by AirAsia,  Richard Branson ’s  Virgin Group
Ltd. , Manara Consortium, based in Bahrain, and Japan’s  Orix Corp.   To contact the reporter on this story:
