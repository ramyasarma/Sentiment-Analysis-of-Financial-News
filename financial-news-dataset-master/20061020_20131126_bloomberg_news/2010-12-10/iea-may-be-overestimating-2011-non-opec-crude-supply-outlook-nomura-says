The International Energy Agency may
be overestimating the outlook next year for oil supply excluding
crude produced by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, according to Nomura International Ltd.  The Paris-based energy  adviser  last month forecast that
crude supply from non-OPEC countries will increase by about
800,000 barrels in 2011 while the group’s production of natural
gas liquids, which aren’t part of its crude output, will rise
by about 700,000 barrels day.  “The IEA’s estimates are on the aggressive side,” Nomura
analysts  Michael Lo  and Cheng Khoo said in the note e-mailed
today. “OPEC NGL might come in lower than expected given
current weakness in the natural gas market.”  Qatar, U.A.E, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Algeria may not
contribute to the output increase as much as the IEA forecasts
because oversupply in the natural-gas market may delay projects
that extract liquid fuels while producing methane, Nomura said.  “Production ramp-up could be slower than expected since
the gas is not fully contracted, which will result in lower
natural gas liquids output,” the analysts said.  Output decline rates in the former Soviet Union may
accelerate to 4.6 percent next year from the 2.2 percent average
of 2002 to 2009, because of a lack of incentives to increase
exploration, Nomura said, citing Wood Mackenzie Consultants Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
