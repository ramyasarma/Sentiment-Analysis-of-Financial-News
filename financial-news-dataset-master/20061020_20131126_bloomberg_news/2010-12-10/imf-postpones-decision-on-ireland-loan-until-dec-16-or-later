The International Monetary Fund
today postponed consideration of a proposed 22.5 billion euro
loan to Ireland ($30 billion) until after the Irish government’s
debate on the rescue package, IMF spokesman  William Murray  said
in a statement today.  The IMF won’t take action until after the Irish
parliament’s vote, scheduled for Dec. 15, Murray said. That
means Dec. 16 is the earliest that Managing Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  could recommend approval to the IMF board, he said.  The IMF made its decision “in deference to Ireland’s
parliamentary process,” Murray said. He repeated that the IMF
welcomes Ireland’s recent passage of fiscal consolidation
measures, saying it “confirms Ireland’s strong commitment to
the program and the policies involved.”  The EU and IMF agreed on an 85-billion euro ($113 billion)
rescue package for  Ireland  on Nov. 28, seven months after a 110-
billion euro bailout for Greece. The  European Central Bank  has
stepped up buying bonds from the region’s most-indebted
countries to prevent the debt crisis from spreading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
