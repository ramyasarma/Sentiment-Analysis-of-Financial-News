Japan will have to take on the
“full force” of the market should it act to weaken the yen
again after trading volumes versus the dollar returned to levels
seen before its September intervention, UBS AG said.  Hedge funds clients “suddenly and dramatically” became
cautious of trading in the currency pair after Japan intervened
in the foreign-exchange market on Sept. 15 for the first time
since 2004, the bank said. Two-way flows in dollar-yen have
since been restored as benchmark 10-year  Treasury yields  began
rising in November and reached a six-month high this week,
 Gareth Berry , a Singapore-based currency strategist wrote in a
note to clients yesterday.  “We have seen a sharp revival in two-way flow in dollar-
yen since U.S. yields began to trend higher,” Berry wrote. “If
U.S. yields fall back, even temporarily, and Japan is forced to
intervene again to support dollar-yen, the Ministry of Finance
will have to push against the full force of a market that has
fully regrouped.”  The dollar traded at 83.76 yen as of 10:28 a.m. in Tokyo
and is headed for a 1.5 percent advance this week. Yields on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury have climbed 21 basis points since
Dec. 3, reaching as high as 3.33 percent on Dec. 8, the most
since June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
