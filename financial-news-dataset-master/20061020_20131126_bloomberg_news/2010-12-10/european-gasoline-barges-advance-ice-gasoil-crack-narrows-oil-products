European  gasoline  barge prices rose
as BP Plc and Koch Industries Inc. purchased lots and crude
costs increased.  Gasoil’s crack, or premium to Brent crude, narrowed to the
lowest level this week. January futures gained on expectations
of colder weather during next week.  Light Products  Gasoline barges  for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $819 to $825 a metric ton,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with deals
yesterday from $819 to $823.  BP and Koch bought 3,000 tons each of the motor fuel.
Gunvor International AG and Trafigura Beheer BV were among the
sellers. The trades are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is
added to make finished fuel.  The  gasoline crack  expanded to $5.80 a barrel from $5.50
yesterday, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
broker in London.  Naphtha’s crack widened to $1.80 a barrel from $1.60
yesterday, PVM data show. Naphtha is used in gasoline and
petrochemicals production.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for December delivery was little changed at $757.75
a ton as of 11:56 a.m. local time on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The December contract expires at midday. The fuel for
January rose 0.3 percent to $768.50 a ton.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profit, shrank 5
cents to $11.85 a barrel, ICE data show. Brent for January rose
0.4 percent to $91.34 a barrel.  “Europe is cold and expected to stay cold for the next 10
days at least,”  Olivier Jakob , managing director at Petromatrix
GmbH, a consultant in Switzerland, wrote today in a note.
“While the European cold weather will translate into a good
burn of heating oil but also a pull on power generation, the
snowfalls should result in some lower consumption of
transportation fuels.”  Refinery News  Refineries are adding more crude-processing units worldwide
than they’re closing as demand for oil products increases, the
Paris-based IEA said.  “Globally, sustained weak margins in 2010 have done little
to stem enthusiasm for new refining capacity,” the Paris-based
agency said. “This year’s buoyant demand growth has only added
to the potential new capacity juggernaut.”  The IEA revised up a June forecast for new crude units by
200,000 barrels a day to 9.2 million barrels a day in the 2009
to 2015 period, according to the report. Additions to global
upgrading and desulfurization capacity amount to 7.3 million
barrels a day and 8 million barrels a day, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
