Former Nigerian military ruler
 Muhammadu Buhari  announced he’s running for president of
Africa’s biggest oil producer in an election expected by April.  Buhari, who toppled an elected government in 1983 and ruled
for 20 months, lost the 2007 presidential vote to  Umaru Yar’Adua , who died in May, three years into his first term. He
declared his intention to run yesterday in a speech to
supporters in Abuja, the capital, according to an e-mailed copy
of the address.  “The main task of my government will be immediately to
tackle rampant insecurity across the land because Nigerians do
not feel secure in their homes,” he said.  Buhari is seeking the nomination of the  Congress for
Progressive Change , a party he formed in March. President
Goodluck Jonathan and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar are
vying for the nomination of the ruling People’s Democratic
Party.  Political parties have until Jan. 15 to nominate their
candidates for various political offices, according to the
election schedule released by the Independent National Electoral
Commission on Nov. 23.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
