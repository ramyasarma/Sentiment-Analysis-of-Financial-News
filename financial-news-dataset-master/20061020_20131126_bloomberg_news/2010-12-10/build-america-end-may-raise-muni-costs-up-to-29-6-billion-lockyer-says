U.S. municipal debt issuers may pay
an extra $14.8 billion to $29.6 billion in interest on bonds
sold in 2011 if the Build America program ends, said California
Treasurer Bill Lockyer.  Securities sold next year would incur an extra 50- to 100-
basis-point penalty over their term, Lockyer said in a release
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
