NBC Universal, the entertainment
company being acquired by Comcast Corp., said it has received
interest in its Focus Features film unit.  “We often receive interest in Focus Features, which is an
attractive asset,” Cindy Gardner, a spokeswoman for Universal
Studios, said today in an e-mail. “But we are not in active
negotiations to sell Focus.”  Brothers Tom and Alec Gores, billionaires who run separate
private-equity companies, are in talks to buy Los Angeles-based
Focus Features, the Los Angeles Times reported earlier.  Terry Fahn, a spokesman for Alec Gores at Sitrick & Co.,
declined to comment, as did Mark Barnhill, a spokesman for Tom
Gores’ Platinum Equity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
