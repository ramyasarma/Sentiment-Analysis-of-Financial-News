Corn futures may open 3 cents to 5
cents a bushel lower and wheat may fall 2 cents to 5 cents a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade after the government said
U.S. and world inventories will be larger than forecast last
month, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  Soybean futures may open steady to 5 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago, as rains boost crops in South America and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture reduced its forecast of domestic
inventories, Schultz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
