A group of utilities, grid operators
and equipment makers plans to study developing a network
spanning the Mediterranean Sea to link Europe to North African
solar-energy projects.  Medgrid, to based in Paris, will carry out feasibility
studies during three years for a grid that may start importing
electricity to Europe by 2020, it said today in a statement.  The 20-shareholder company, created yesterday, is a “major
step” toward plans to develop 20 gigawatts of mostly solar
renewable energy by 2020 in North African and eastern
Mediterranean countries, a quarter of which will be exported to
Europe, according to the statement.  Medgrid’s mostly European 21 partners include  Abengoa SA ,
Alstom SA,  Areva SA , Electricite de France SA, GDF Suez SA,
Prysmian, Red Electrica Corp. SA,  Siemens AG , Taqa Arabia and
Terna SA.  More than 30 European companies have joined the Desertec
Industrial Initiative, which seeks to connect Europe to solar
power in the Sahara through high-voltage transmission cables.  To contact the reporter on this story:
