Senegalese President  Abdoulaye Wade 
told ministers yesterday to create an Agency for Afro-Arab
Affairs to attract more Arab investment into the country’s
agrarian economy.  Wade made the request after returning from a conference in
Saudi Arabia, according to the minutes of Cabinet meeting
published on the government’s website. The president also asked
the Foreign Ministry to look into new visa rules to make it
easier to travel to and from the Gulf region.  The West African nation, which is overwhelmingly Muslim,
maintains close ties with Iran, whose president is scheduled to
visit this month, Senegalese presidential spokesman Pape Diagne
said in a Nov. 19 interview. It has also improved links with
Saudi Arabia, whose BinLaden Group has a controlling stake in
the country’s only oil refinery, Societe Africaine de Raffinage.  The Saudi Arabian investment fund, Foras International, is
looking to lease a “large” amount of agricultural land in
Senegal to produce rice, spokesman Momar Gueye said on Dec. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
