A tax-grant program for wind and
solar-energy companies will be extended for one year after the
industry warned of job losses without the aid, under a tax
agreement reached by U.S. senators today, according to a
Republican congressional aide.  The tax package also benefits producers of ethanol by
extending for one year a 45 cents per-gallon break to blend the
corn-based fuel with gasoline, according to the aide, who
declined to be identifed because the details haven’t been made
public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
