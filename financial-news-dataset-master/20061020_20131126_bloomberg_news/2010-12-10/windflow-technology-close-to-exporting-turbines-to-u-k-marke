Windflow Technology Ltd. , a New
Zealand maker of wind turbines, said it is “weeks” away from
exporting to the U.K. market.  The company has had almost 400 inquiries from potential
customers, Chairman  Barrie Leay  said in a telephone interview.
“The U.K. market could be very profitable for us because the
government offers feed-in tariffs for projects that use turbines
with capacities of 500 kilowatts and below,” he said.  Windflow raised NZ$3.3 million ($2.5 million) from a rights
offer, the Christchurch-based manufacturer said in a Dec. 8
statement. Proceeds will go mainly for its entry into the U.K.
market, where it is working with a distributor to help conduct
site surveys and feasibility studies for potential projects.  Windflow, whose shares have declined 37 percent this year,
still expects New Zealand to be its main market, Leay said. “We
have enough capacity to scale up our manufacturing when demand
increases,” he said.  The company produces 60 turbines a year and can increase
this to 200 annually, it said on its website.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
