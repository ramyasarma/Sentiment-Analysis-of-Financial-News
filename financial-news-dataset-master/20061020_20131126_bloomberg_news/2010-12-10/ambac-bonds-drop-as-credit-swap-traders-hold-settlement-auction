Bonds of  Ambac Financial Group Inc. 
fell today as credit-default swaps traders held an auction to
settle contracts linked to the bankrupt debt insurer.  Ambac’s $250 million of 9.5 percent notes due in February
2021 declined 6 cents to 10 cents on the dollar as of 11:41 a.m.
in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Credit swaps traders settling contracts that protected
against a default by Ambac set an initial value off 12.75 cents
on the dollar for the debt, according to www.creditfixings.com.
The final value will be set after a second round of the auction,
in which a net demand to sell $407.9 million of the debt will be
matched with orders from dealers and their client, The final
values are scheduled to be released at 2 p.m. in New York.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its debt obligations less the value of the
defaulted debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
