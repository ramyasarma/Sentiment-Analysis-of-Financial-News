China stocks  rose, erasing a weekly
loss for the benchmark index, as commodity producers gained
after the nation’s exports rose and insurers climbed on
speculation higher borrowing costs would boost investment yields.  PetroChina Co.  was the biggest contributor to gains on the
benchmark index and  Jiangxi Copper Co.  climbed 1.7 percent after
outbound and inbound shipments climbed to a record and materials
prices increased. China Life Insurance Co. paced an advance by
insurers ahead of tomorrow’s release of a report expected to
show inflation accelerated last month, boosting the case for
higher interest rates.  “Some investors are betting the situation would become
clearer after this weekend but that won’t change the overall
downward pressure in the market,” said Deng Changrong, a
strategist at Huaxi Securities Co. in Shenzhen.  The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 1.1 percent to 2,841.04 at the 3
p.m. close. The CSI 300 Index climbed 1.2 percent to 3,161.98.  -- Irene Shen . Editors:  Richard Frost ,  Allen Wan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
