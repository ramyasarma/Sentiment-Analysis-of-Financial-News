New England Patriots linebacker
Brandon Spikes was suspended four games without pay for
violating the National Football League’s policy on performance-
enhancing drugs.  The team’s second-leading tackler will miss the rest of the
regular season, beginning with this weekend’s game against the
Chicago Bears. He is eligible for all postseason games,
according to a statement on the NFL’s website.  Spikes, a rookie who has 61 tackles and one interception in
12 games this season, apologized to teammates and fans. He said
in a statement posted on the Patriots’ website that he took
medication that wasn’t performance enhancing or illegal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
