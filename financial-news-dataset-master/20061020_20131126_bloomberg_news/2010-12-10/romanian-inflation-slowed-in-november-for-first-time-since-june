Romania’s  inflation  rate dropped in
November for the first time in five months as weaker demand
partly offset the effects of a 5 percentage-point increase in
the value-added tax from July.  The rate fell to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent in October,
the Bucharest-based  National Statistics Institute  said today in
an e-mail. On the month, prices advanced 0.5 percent. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of seven economists was for
annual inflation of 7.8 percent.  Romania, which turned to international lenders for a
bailout last year as a recession eroded budget revenue, raised
the VAT to 24 percent in July to meet a budget-deficit target of
6.8 percent of economic output this year and 4.4 percent in
2011. It got a 20 billion-euro ($26.5 billion) bailout from the
International Monetary Fund and the European Union.  “Pressures coming from food inflation probably grew in
November, but less leu weakening versus the euro and no major
hikes in regulated prices would justify a slowdown in the
monthly rate of inflation to 0.5 percent from 0.6 percent,” ING
Bank Romania SA analysts led by Nicolaie Alexandru-Chidesciuc
wrote in a note to clients before the inflation data release.
“Such an outcome would imply year-end inflation below 8 percent
versus 8.2 percent expected by the central bank.”  The central bank on Nov. 4 raised its 2010 inflation
forecast to 8.2 percent and to 3.4 percent next year. That
compares with August estimates of 7.8 percent and 3.1 percent
respectively.  Food-price inflation accelerated to an annual 6 percent in
November compared with 5.5 percent in October, the institute
said. Prices for services rose an annual 6.1 percent and non-
food prices gained 9.7 percent, compared with 10.6 percent the
previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
