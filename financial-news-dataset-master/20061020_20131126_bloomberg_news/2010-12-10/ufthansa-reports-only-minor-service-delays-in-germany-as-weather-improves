Deutsche Lufthansa AG  said flight
delays in Germany this morning are minor and that operations
should return to normal later on as weather conditions improve.  “We expect the situation to normalize completely in the
course of the day as the weather gets better,” Lufthansa
spokesman  Patrick Meschenmoser  said today by phone. There are no
major cancelations to Lufthansa’s German services, he said.  Snow is forecast for southern Germany later today, although
the central part of the country may stay dry, said Thomas
Ruppert of the Frankfurt-based German Weather Service.
Temperatures are expected to rise, he said.  Hundreds of flights were grounded in Germany yesterday due
to snowfall and freezing temperatures. The problems were
compounded in Berlin because of a lack of de-icing fluid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
