Auburn University’s  Cameron Newton ,
who is favored to win college football’s Heisman Trophy, won the
Davey O’Brien Award as the nation’s best quarterback.  Newton accounted for 49 touchdowns in leading Auburn (13-0)
to the Southeastern Conference championship and a spot in the
Bowl Championship Series national title game against the
University of Oregon.  He overcame distractions during his junior year that
included a probe into a pay-for-play demand organized by his
father and allegations of cheating while he was at the
University of Florida.  Oregon’s LaMichael James claimed the Doak Walker Award
presented to the best running back last night at the College
Football Awards in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.  Oklahoma State University’s Justin Blackmon took the
Biletnikoff Award as the best receiver, while Louisiana State
University cornerback Patrick Peterson earned the Jim Thorpe
Award as the best defensive back.  D.J. Williams of the University of Arkansas received the
John Mackey Award as the top tight end, while Florida’s Chas
Henry won the Ray Guy Award for best punter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
