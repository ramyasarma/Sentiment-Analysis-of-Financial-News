Youku.com Inc. , the largest online
video site in China, will invest in content and technology to
expand market share, Chief Executive Officer  Victor Koo  said.  “There is still continuing consumer growth and we feel
that we need to invest in content and technology to extend our
market share,” Koo said. “By investing in content and
technology, as penetration increases, we will be able to grow
our market share like we have done last year.”  Youku climbed 28 percent to $42.70 yesterday in New York
trading after surging 161 percent on its debut the previous day.
It was the biggest gain for a U.S. initial public offering since
2005, when  Beijing-based Baidu Inc. , owner of China’s most-used
Internet search engine, began trading.  Youku leads China’s online video market that has grown at a
compound annual rate of 74 percent in the past three years and
is set to more than double over the next two, according to
Shanghai-based iResearch.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
