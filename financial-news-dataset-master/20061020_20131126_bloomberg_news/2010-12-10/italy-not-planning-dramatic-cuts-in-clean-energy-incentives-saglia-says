Italy isn’t planning “dramatic”
cuts in clean-energy incentives, preferring a gradual approach
that will favor consumers without harming the business, Industry
Ministry Undersecretary Stefano Saglia said.  “We believe in renewable energy and we don’t plan to
reduce incentives dramatically as occurred in some other
countries,” Saglia said at a conference in Rome today. “We are
working on changes but they will be gradual.”  The Italian government is drafting legislation regulating
clean-energy incentives. Spain recently reduced subsidies paid
to solar-thermal power plants and some wind farms to limit the
cost of electricity for consumers.  Saglia said he also aims to reduce consumers’ bills but
without hurting producers and risking a slowdown in renewable
energy development.  The new rules will eliminate the current system of green
certificates, replacing it with feed-in tariffs for small
renewable-energy producers and auctions for larger producers,
Saglia said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
