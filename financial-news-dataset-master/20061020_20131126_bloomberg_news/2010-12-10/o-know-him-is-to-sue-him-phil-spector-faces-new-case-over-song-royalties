Pop singer Darlene Love and the
vocal group the Ronettes have again sued producer  Phil Spector ,
who’s in prison in California for murder, for unpaid royalties
on songs recorded in the 1960s.  The plaintiffs, who include Spector’s former wife Ronnie
Greenfield, charge that Spector has violated a 2009 court-
ordered settlement agreement that required him to pay royalties
twice a year, according to a complaint filed yesterday in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York.  “Defendants have generated millions of dollars through the
sale of plaintiffs’ musical recordings, yet have paid only a
fraction of royalties,” lawyers for the singers said in the
complaint.  Spector is serving a 19-year sentence on a second-degree
murder conviction in the California Substance Abuse Treatment
Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, according to the
complaint.  Love sang with the groups the Blossoms, the Crystals and
Bob B. Soxx and the Blue Jeans. The Crystals’ hits included “Da
Doo Ron Ron.”  Other plaintiffs include members of the Ronettes: the
estate of Estelle Bennett, Ronnie’s sister; and their cousin
Nedra Talley Ross.  The Ronettes signed with Spector’s Phillies Records, also a
defendant, in 1963 and recorded hits including “Be My Baby.”  The case is Darlene Love v. Phil Spector, 652227-2010,
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. An
earlier case was Ronnie Greenfield v. Phillies Records, 000763-
1988, Supreme Court of the State of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
