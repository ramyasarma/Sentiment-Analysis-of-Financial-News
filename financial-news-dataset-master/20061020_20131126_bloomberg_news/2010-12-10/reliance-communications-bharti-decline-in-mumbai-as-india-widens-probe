Reliance Communications Ltd., Bharti
Airtel Ltd. and Idea Cellular Ltd. fell in Mumbai trading.  India will ask a retired Supreme Court judge to examine the
procedures followed by the department of telecommunication in
the award of airwave licenses since 2001, Telecommunications
Minister Kapil Sibal said yesterday. Notices will be sent to
companies holding 85 licenses sold in 2008, as well as companies
that have not met network roll-out obligations set by
the government. Sibal didn’t identify any companies.  Reliance Communications declined as much as 2.3 percent,
Bharti fell 4 percent and Idea dropped 2.7 percent at 9:20 a.m. local
time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
