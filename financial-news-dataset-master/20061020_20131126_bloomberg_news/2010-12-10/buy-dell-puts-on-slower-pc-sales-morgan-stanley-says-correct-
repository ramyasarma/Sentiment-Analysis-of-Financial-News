Investors should buy bearish  Dell
Inc.  options because the third-largest personal-computer may
drop as rising sales of tablets such as Apple Inc.’s iPad hurt
personal computer sales, Morgan Stanley said.  Equity derivatives strategists  Christopher Metli  and  Sivan Mahadevan  recommended buying January 2012 $12.50 puts while
selling that month’s $10 puts, a strategy known as a put spread
that cuts the cost of the trade while capping potential profit.
Dell rose 1.8 percent to $13.89 as of 4 p.m. in New York, paring
this year’s loss to 3.3 percent. The trade breaks even if the
stock falls to $11.72, the strategists wrote.  “The market underestimates impending hits to Dell’s
 earnings  and valuation,” the New York-based strategists wrote
yesterday, citing Morgan Stanley technology industry analyst
Katy Huberty’s Dec. 6 report. Huberty has an “underweight”
rating on Round Rock, Texas-based Dell.  Risks include “cannibalization of PCs by tablets” and
slowing PC and server sales next year, Huberty’s report said.
Profit may fall 3 percent in 2011 from this year because of
slower revenue growth and narrower profit margins, she wrote.  “About two-thirds of Dell’s revenue and half of its
operating income base are at risk from moderating PC and server
growth in C2011,” Huberty wrote in a Dec. 6 report. “Dell’s PC
business faces major headwinds from desktop virtualization and
tablet adoption in C2011, which may pressure Dell’s model as PCs
account for over half of its revenue and nearly 30% of its
operating income.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
