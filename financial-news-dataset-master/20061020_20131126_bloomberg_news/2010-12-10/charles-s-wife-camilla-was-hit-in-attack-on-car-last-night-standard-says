Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall,
was hit by a protester through an open car window in central
London last night as she and her husband, Prince Charles, were
being driven to the theater, the Evening Standard newspaper
reported today.  A protester managed to push a stick through the window and
jab her in the ribs, the Standard said, citing a police source.  The car windows were left open by mistake as the car
entered an area where protesters were demonstrating against an
increase in student tuition fees, the Standard reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
