TNT said its crime series “The
Closer” will end after its seventh season next year in a
decision made by  Kyra Sedgwick , the show’s star.  The program, often the most-watched on cable television,
will conclude with a 15-episode season, the  Time Warner Inc. -
owned network said today in an e-mailed statement. Sedgwick won
an Emmy this year for her lead role as Deputy Police Chief
Brenda Johnson.  The role involved “a rich and complex character who I have
loved living with year after year,” Sedgwick said in the
statement.  “The Closer,” which follows the head of the Los Angeles
Police Department’s Major Crimes unit, helped TNT break into
more original scripted programming after its 2005 premiere. The
show and the new series “Rizzoli & Isles” averaged more than
8 million viewers in 2010, ranking as cable’s top two programs,
according to TNT.  The show was created by executive producer James Duff,
Greer Shephard, Michael M. Robin, Rick Wallace and Sedgwick.
It’s produced by Shephard/Robin Co. and New York-based Time
Warner’s Warner Bros. Television.  Time Warner rose 40 cents to $31.79 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained
9.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
