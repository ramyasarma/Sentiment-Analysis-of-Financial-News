Hong Kong  stocks  dropped as Chinese
banks and developers fell on concern the mainland government
will raise interest rates this weekend.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. , a state-controlled
mainland developer, sank 1.2 percent. Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd., the nation’s fourth-largest bank by assets, slipped 1
percent. Hotel operator  Shangri-La Asia Ltd.  slumped 4 percent
after saying it will sell shares at a discount to existing
shareholders. Alibaba.com Ltd., operator of China’s biggest
online-commerce site for businesses, climbed 4.3 percent after
declaring a special dividend of 22 Hong Kong cents.  “We will see further tightening in China,”  Kirk West ,
executive director of international investments at Principal
Global Investors, which manages $215 billion of assets globally,
said on Bloomberg Television. “We will most likely see a number
of measures, including interest-rate increases and higher
reserve ratios for lenders, being implemented in 2011.”  The  Hang Seng Index  fell less than 0.1 percent to 23,162.91
at the close, extending this week’s fall to 0.7 percent. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares of
Chinese companies slid 0.6 percent to 12,661.01.  The benchmark Hang Seng Index has slumped 6.2 percent since
a government report on Nov. 11 showed China’s inflation
accelerated to 4.4 percent in October, the fastest pace in two
years, sparking speculation the People’s Bank of China will
raise interest rates.  Rate Increase Imminent  Government data to be released tomorrow may show consumer
prices climbed 4.7 percent last month, the highest in three
years, according to the median estimate of 29 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The CPI may have risen by 5.1 percent,
the Economic Information Daily reported today, without saying
where it got the information.  The statistics bureau brought forward the release of the
inflation data, along with other economic data, to Dec. 11 from
Dec. 13. The move signals an interest-rate increase may be
imminent,  Glenn Maguire , chief Asia economist at Societe
Generale SA, said yesterday.  China Overseas Land fell 1.2 percent to HK$15.02. Longfor
Properties Co., the biggest developer in the southwestern
Chinese city of Chongqing, sank 1.5 percent to HK$10.70.
 Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. , China’s third-biggest
developer by sales, slumped 4.3 percent to HK$3.99.  China’s property prices rose at the slowest pace in a year
in November after the government raised the reserve-ratio
requirement for banks twice and expanded measures to limit the
risk of asset bubbles.  Share Sales  Agricultural Bank declined 1 percent to HK$4.06. Industrial
& Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest lender,
lost 0.5 percent to HK$5.83. Bank of Communications Co., the
Chinese lender that gets more than half of revenue from
corporate clients, lost 0.4 percent to HK$8.02.  Shangri-La Asia, Asia’s biggest luxury-hotel operator which
gets about 45 percent of revenue from China, slumped 4 percent
to HK$19.88. The company said it will  raise  at least HK$4.69
billion ($603.5 million) selling as many as 241.7 million shares
to existing shareholders at HK$19.50 each. Proceeds from the
share sale will be used to repay a “substantial portion” of
the company’s debts, it said.  China Metal Recycling Holdings Ltd. , the nation’s biggest
scrap metal recycler, tumbled 7.6 percent to HK$8.16. The
company said it will raise net proceeds of HK$691 million
selling shares at HK$7.85 through a share placement.  Among stocks that advanced,  Alibaba  climbed 4.3 percent to
HK$13.96. Chief Executive Officer David Wei said at the
company’s shareholders meeting today that he is “dissatisfied”
with the stock’s performance and the company will review its
dividend policies to boost returns to investors. Alibaba will
pay a special cash dividend of 22 Hong Kong cents per share to
shareholders on record as of Dec. 31.  Almost three stocks fell for every two that rose on the 45-
member Hang Seng Index. Futures on the gauge gained 0.2 percent
to 23,195.  To contact the reporter on this story:
