Stocks in Switzerland retreated amid
speculation that China will increase interest rates as soon as
this weekend to prevent the world’s fastest-growing major
economy from overheating.  Staffing company  Adecco SA  lost 1.4 percent and  Credit
Suisse AG , Switzerland’s second-largest bank slipped 1.1
percent, offsetting gains from  Swatch Group  AG and drugmaker
 Actelion Ltd.   The  Swiss Market Index  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies fell 0.3 percent to 6,519.14 at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Zurich, trimming the measure’s weekly
advance to 1.2 percent. The SMI has rallied 9.7 percent since
July 5 as corporate profits climbed, the Federal Reserve
unveiled a $600 billion bond-purchase program to support the
U.S. economic recovery and the European Union bailed out Greece
and Ireland. The broader  Swiss Performance Index  dropped 0.3
percent today.  “A lack of appetite for risk has driven people away from
stocks, but historically the market has rallied into the year
end,” said Monaco-based  Toby Campbell-Gray , head of trading,
sales and risk at Tavira Securities Ltd., an agency brokerage.  China’s leaders will in coming days set a course for policy
in 2011 that will help determine whether the world’s second-
largest economy will succeed in reining in inflation without
hobbling expansion. President  Hu Jintao  and Premier  Wen Jiabao 
convene the Central Economic Work Conference, a three-day
conclave in Beijing, starting today.  Inflation Threat  China ordered lenders to park more money with the central
bank for the third time in five weeks to counter the threat from
inflation after November’s lending and trade surplus topped
analysts’ estimates. Reserve requirements will increase 50 basis
points starting Dec. 20, the People’s Bank of China said on its
website today.  European equities will climb 12 percent through the end of
2011 as rising earnings and record-low interest rates help
companies overcome the sovereign-debt crisis, a Bloomberg survey
of 13 strategists shows. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
bullish forecaster, says the  Stoxx 600  will rally 20 percent as
profits expand twice as fast as the 14 percent average rate in
more than 26,000 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Adecco, the supplier of temporary workers, fell 1.4 percent
to 61.55 francs and Credit Suisse dropped 1.1 percent to 38.79
francs.  Swatch added 1.7 percent to 421.6 francs. Actelion, the
subject of takeover speculation, advanced 1.3 percent to 52.7
francs. The company wants to remain independent, Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Paul Clozel said today at a press event in
Allschwil, Switzerland. Actelion is discussing partnerships and
may sign some deals in 2011, he said.  In the SPI,  Norinvest Holding SA  dropped 4.8 percent to 4
francs while  Precious Woods Holding AG  surged 10 percent to 17.4
