Orco Property Group SA , a property
developer with most of its assets in central Europe, plans to
speed up sales and increase rental revenue as it cuts debt under
a court-approved overhaul plan.  Orco plans to sell property for about 300 million euros
($397 million) next year, up from more than 200 million euros
this year, Chief Executive Officer  Jean-Francois Ott  said in an
interview in Warsaw today. The company forecasts total sales of
280 million euros to 300 million euros this year, rising to a
range of 350 million euros to 380 million euros next year.  Orco, whose debt is 14 times its market capitalization, had
998 million euros of bank loans in September, while the value of
outstanding bonds exceeded 235 million euros, according to a
regulatory statement on Nov. 25. Its main lenders include Erste
Group Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, and UniCredit
SpA of Italy. The current market value is 89 million euros.  In addition to increasing property sales, Luxembourg-based
Orco aims to double annual rental revenue to 200 million euros
over the next four years, Ott said today.  The company emerged from creditor protection in May after a
Paris-based court approved its plan to change its corporate
structure and to repay creditors over 10 years.  “There are three ways to reduce our debt: we can sell
assets, raise capital, or swap debt for equity,” Ott said. “If
anything happens in this respect, it will happen next year.”  About one-third of total 2011  revenue  may come from the
sale of the Sky Office building in Dusseldorf, Germany, which
Ott values at 120 million euros to 140 million euros.  Permit Renewed  Orco, which this week said it hired Italy’s Consorzio
Cooperative Costruzioni as general contractor for its flagship
Warsaw building, plans to complete the project in 2012 after
local authorities ended their suspension of the permit, Ott
said.  The company forecasts revenue of 250 million euros from
selling all 251 flats at the Zlota 44 project, designed by
 Daniel Libeskind , Ott said.  Construction costs will be about 100 million euros, and the
financing includes 50 million euros from UniCredit SpA unit Bank
Pekao SA, he added. The 192-meter (630-foot) tower, in which
Orco has already sold 88 units, will be Warsaw’s tallest
apartment building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
