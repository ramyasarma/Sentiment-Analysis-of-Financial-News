Ghana’s currency, the cedi, weakened
for a fourth day against the dollar as companies demanded
greenbacks and traders awaited a central bank bond sale.  The currency was trading 0.5 percent lower at 1.467 by
11:35 a.m. in Accra, the capital, according to data from
Standard Bank Group Ltd. trader Chris Nettey.  “We are facing a lot of demand pressure for dollars at the
moment,” he said by phone from Accra. “We were expecting a bond
auction this month, but I think it will move into next month.”  Kwabena Owusu, a currency trader at Access Bank Plc, said a
decision today by the Bank of Ghana to maintain its policy rate
at 13.5 percent, which was widely expected, didn’t affect the
cedi. “Trading has been quite stable today,” he said in a phone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
