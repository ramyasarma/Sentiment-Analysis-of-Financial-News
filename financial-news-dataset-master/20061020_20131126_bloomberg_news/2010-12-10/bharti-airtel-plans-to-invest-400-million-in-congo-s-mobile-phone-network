Bharti Airtel Ltd. , India’s biggest
mobile-phone operator, plans to invest $400 million in the
 Democratic Republic of Congo  over the next three years to
improve the Central African country’s phone network.  The company has rebranded the Congo operations of Kuwaiti
phone company Zain, which it bought in June as part of its $9
billion acquisition of most of the African assets of Zain,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  Bharti Airtel plans “to extend reach to the most rural
areas, ensuring our services touch everyone and bridge the
digital divide in the country,” Antoine Pamboro, Airtel’s
managing director in Congo, said in the statement.  By acquiring Zain, Airtel became the leading service
provider in Congo, Africa’s fourth-most populous nation with
about 68 million people, Airtel spokesman Patrick Umba said by
phone today from Kinshasa, the capital. As of December 2009,
about 15 percent of Congolese had mobile-phone subscriptions,
according to Bloomberg data.  At the end 2009, Zain had an estimated 45 percent share of
the mobile-phone market, according to its 2009 annual report.
The market share is still approximately the same, Umba said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
