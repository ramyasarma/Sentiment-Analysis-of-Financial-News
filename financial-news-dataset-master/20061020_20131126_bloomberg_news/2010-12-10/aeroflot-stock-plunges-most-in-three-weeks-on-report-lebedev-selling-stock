OAO Aeroflot  fell the most in more
than five months after Interfax reported billionaire  Alexander Lebedev  agreed to sell 44 million shares for about $2.50 apiece,
without providing any more information immediately.  Russia’s largest airline dropped 3.9 percent, the biggest
decline since July 1, to 80.71 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close in
Moscow. The stock earlier fell as much as 5.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
