The dollar fell against the euro,
paring a weekly gain, on speculation Federal Reserve policy
makers on Dec. 14 will discuss a plan to extend Treasury
purchases to support growth.  The dollar dropped as benchmark Treasury yields declined
for a second day, damping the allure of U.S. assets. Fed
officials announced last month a $600 billion second round of
debt buying through June. The Australian dollar is set for a
weekly drop on concern Chinese  inflation  data tomorrow will back
the case for the Asian nation to tighten monetary policy.  “I don’t think the Fed wants yields to keep rising right
now, and they are likely to try to tame yield gains next week,”
said  Kengo Suzuki , manager of the foreign bond department in
Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co. “The dollar is likely to switch
back to a negative trend.”  The dollar fell to $1.3263 per euro at 7:09 a.m. in London
from $1.3239 in New York yesterday, when it touched $1.3165, the
highest since Dec. 2. It has gained 1.1 percent against the euro
this week. The euro was at 111.11 yen following a 0.5 percent
drop yesterday to 110.87 yen. The dollar traded at 83.69 yen
from 83.76 yen, set for a 1.4 percent gain this week.  The  Dollar Index,  which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the euro,
yen and pound, fell 0.2 percent to 79.867, paring its weekly
advance to 0.6 percent.  Australia’s currency was at 98.64 U.S. cents from 98.37
cents, set for a 0.7 percent decline this week.  China’s  consumer prices  rose 4.7 percent in November from a
year earlier, a statistics bureau report will show tomorrow,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. That would be the fastest pace since August 2008.
The Economic Information Daily said today the figure may be 5.1
percent.  China Rates  “The danger is China raises interest rates steeply,
causing a hard landing for the Chinese economy which would
obviously hurt Australia’s exports,” said  Derek Mumford , a
Sydney-based director at Richford Capital, a foreign-exchange
and rates risk management firm. “That’s holding the Aussie
dollar back along with a degree of uncertainty in U.S. equity
markets with concern around long-term interest rates.”  The “window” for China’s central bank to raise borrowing
costs could be this weekend, according a report in the China
Securities Journal this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
