Gold futures fell, capping the
biggest weekly loss in a month, as concern that China may
tighten monetary policy eroded demand for precious metals.
Silver, palladium and platinum also dropped.  China, the world’s second-biggest gold buyer, ordered
lenders to park more money with the central bank for the third
time in five weeks. The metal has climbed 26 percent this year,
reaching a record $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7.  “Gold is temporarily moving lower on China’s attempt to
slow down its economy,” said  Marty McNeill , a trader at R.F.
Lafferty & Co. Inc. in New York. “A lot of the hot money has
been going to China, so when it starts to break down, gold is
going to get sold off with other commodities.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell $7.90, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $1,384.90 on the Comex in New York. This
week, the metal dropped 1.5 percent, the most since mid-
November.  A rate increase by China’s central bank “would diminish
the ability of Chinese consumers to use excess income on
investments like gold, as well as their ability to buy other
commodities,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global
Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products fell 2.22 metric
tons to 2,095.76 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14. India is the biggest physical buyer.  Silver holdings gained 11.13 tons to 15,020.19 tons, the
highest since at least February, data from four providers show.  Silver Declines  Silver futures for March delivery fell 21.2 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $28.605 an ounce, down 2.3 percent this week. On
Dec. 7, the price reached $30.75, the highest since March 1980.
The metal has jumped 70 percent in 2010.  “Investors who view silver as a safe-haven asset are
expected to continue buying large amounts over the next couple
of years,” CPM Group, a New York-based research company, said
yesterday in a report. The metal will be supported by industrial
use, and China may account for 20 percent of global-fabrication
demand this year, CPM said.  Palladium futures for March delivery slid $8.90, or 1.2
percent, to $732.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, down 4.9 percent this week. The price has gained 79
percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery declined $3.60, or
0.2 percent, to $1,675.30 an ounce. The price dropped for the
fifth straight day, the longest slump in four months. The weekly
loss was 3 percent. The metal has climbed 14 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
