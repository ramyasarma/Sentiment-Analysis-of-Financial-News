Vestas Wind Systems A/S , the world’s
largest maker of wind turbines, rose the most in eight months in
Copenhagen trading after U.S. Senate negotiators approved
extending grants to renewable-energy companies.  Vestas jumped 11.2 kroner, or 7 percent, to 171 kroner, the
biggest one-day gain  since April 7  in the Danish capital. That
pared the loss this year for the Randers, Denmark-based company
to 46 percent. Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA, Spain’s
biggest wind-turbine manufacturer, rose 6.4 percent.  The program, which still needs to be passed by the full
Senate, gives developers grants for almost one-third of a
project’s value, according to the bill released late yesterday.
The U.S. Treasury Department has issued more than $5.5 billion
in grants, underwriting more than $18 billion in renewable
projects, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.  “Good news for Vestas,” Silkeborg, Denmark-based Jyske
Bank A/S, which has a “buy”  rating  on Vestas shares, said
today in a note to investors. “An extension is now a lot closer
to becoming a reality after the issue previously has been left
completely out in the cold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
