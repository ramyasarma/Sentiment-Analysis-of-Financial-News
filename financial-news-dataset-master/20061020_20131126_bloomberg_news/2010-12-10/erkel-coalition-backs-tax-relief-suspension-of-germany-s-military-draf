German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
coalition backed tax-relief measures for companies and
individuals worth about 4.5 billion euros ($6 billion) and
agreed to suspend army conscription.  Leaders of the three coalition parties meeting in Berlin
late yesterday approved plans to streamline bureaucracy to save
companies about 4 billion euros, plus about 590 million euros in
immediate tax relief through measures such as replacing
paperwork with electronic documentation, ARD television said.  Merkel’s Free Democratic Party coalition partner defended
the agreement against charges by taxpayer and industry lobby
groups that the tax steps are insufficient as the economy,
Europe’s biggest, is forecast to expand this year at the fastest
pace since reunification. The FDP, struggling at historic lows
in opinion polls, won election last year on a platform of tax
cuts.  “Nobody’s saying this will make our tax system simple,”
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , a member of Merkel’s
Christian Democrats, said on ARD. “But it’s a step in the
direction of less bureaucracy.”  The coalition also agreed to suspend army conscription from
July 1, 2011, Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg todl
the channel. Overall military numbers will be 185,000, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
