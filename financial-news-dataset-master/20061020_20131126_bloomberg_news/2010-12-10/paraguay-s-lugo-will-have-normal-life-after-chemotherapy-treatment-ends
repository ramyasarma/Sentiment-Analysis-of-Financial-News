Paraguay President  Fernando Lugo  has
“totally recovered” after completing his final chemotherapy
treatment for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma last week, according to a
government statement.  “Beginning today, President Lugo can lead a normal life,”
said a  statement  on the website of the Secretariat for
Information and Communication for Development.  Lugo, 59, will begin taking on more work after getting a
final checkup yesterday, the statement said. The former Roman
Catholic bishop, who was elected in 2008, lost his hair during
treatment for the disease in Paraguayan and Brazilian hospitals
following his diagnosis in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
