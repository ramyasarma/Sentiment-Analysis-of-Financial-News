Formula One canceled a rule banning
teams from conspiring to fix the finishing place of their
drivers, and agreed to use more fuel-efficient engines in the
car racing series from 2013.  The changes were announced on the website of Paris-based
ruling body  Federation Internationale de l’Automobile .  The rule on race fixing, introduced in 2002, was
reconsidered after Ferrari instructed  Felipe Massa  to let
teammate  Fernando Alonso  pass to win July’s German Grand Prix.
Ferrari got a $100,000 fine at the time.  The 2013 engine, which addresses “the needs” of the car
industry, will be four-cylinder, 1.6-liter units that reduce
fuel consumption by 35 percent, the FIA said. Currently, the
series uses 2.4-liter engines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
