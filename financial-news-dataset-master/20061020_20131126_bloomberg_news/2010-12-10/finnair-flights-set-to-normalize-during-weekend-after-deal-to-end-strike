Most flights by  Finnair Oyj ,
Finland’s biggest airline, will return to normal during the
weekend after a ten-day strike by its cabin crews ended in a
settlement last night.  Delays and cancellations are possible for the next few
days, Finnair said on its website today.  “The most important thing is to get aircraft moving again
and to end the strike that has inconvenienced our customers,”
Chief Executive Officer  Mika Vehvilaeinen  said in a statement
yesterday. “The new agreement ensures that we can reduce costs
through improved work productivity.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
