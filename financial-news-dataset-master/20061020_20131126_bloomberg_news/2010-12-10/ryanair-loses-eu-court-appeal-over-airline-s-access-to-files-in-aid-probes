Ryanair Holdings Plc , Europe’s
largest discount airline, lost a court appeal where it sought to
overturn a decision by the European Union’s regulator not to
provide information about probes of state aid to airports.  The European Commission was “entitled in law to conclude
that there was no overriding public interest justifying
disclosure of the documents,” the Luxembourg-based  EU General
Court , the region’s second-highest court, ruled today.  The European Commission, which checks whether subsidies
distort competition in the 27-nation EU, in 2007 and 2008 opened
formal probes into Finnish state subsidies for Tampere Pirkkala
Airport and German aid for Frankfurt-Hahn that may have
benefitted Ryanair.  The EU court two years ago canceled a 2004 decision by the
Brussels-based commission that annulled an agreement between
Ryanair and state-owned Charleroi airport in Belgium. This was
the most prominent in a series of disputes between the EU and
Ryanair, alongside probes into eight other airports at issue in
today’s case.  The other EU state aid probes Ryanair sought documents for
related to Aarhus Airport in Denmark, Alghero airport in Italy,
Pau airport in France, Bratislava airport in Slovakia and German
airports Berlin Schoenefeld and Luebeck.  “We regret that the Court did not share our view” about
document access, Ryanair said in an e-mailed statement following
the ruling. “This ruling highlights the urgent need for reform
of the EU’s procedures in state aid investigations, where
currently companies such as Ryanair are deprived of their right
to fair procedure and a fair defense.”  The cases are T-494/08, T-495/08, T-496/08, T-497/08, T-
498/08, T-499/08, T-500/08, T-509/08, Ryanair v European
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
