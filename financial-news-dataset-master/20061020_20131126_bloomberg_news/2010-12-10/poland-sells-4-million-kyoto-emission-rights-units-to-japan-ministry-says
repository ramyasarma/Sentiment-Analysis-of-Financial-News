Poland sold 4 million emission
permits under the Kyoto Protocol to Japan, adding to 80 million
euros ($106 million) of sales so far this year.  The environment ministry didn’t disclose the value of the
Japanese sale in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Assigned Amount Units, or AAUs, are allocated to countries
with greenhouse-gas emission targets that were set as part of
the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Each is a national license to release
the equivalent of 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide from utilities
and factories. The system allows countries with spare credits to
sell them to nations that exceed their quota.  Poland has the world’s third-largest surplus of AAUs after
Russia and Ukraine, amounting to around 500 million permits for
the five years from 2008, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
