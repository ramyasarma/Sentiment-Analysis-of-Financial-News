OPEC’s crude oil production capacity
will dip next year then rise steadily through 2012 to 2015,
according to a monthly report from the International Energy
Agency.  The daily production capacity for all 12 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is forecast at
35.50 million barrels for this year, 35.22 million barrels for
2011 and 36.94 million barrels for 2015, it said.  Capacity declines in 2011 are forecast in Algeria, Angola,
Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, according to the
report from the Paris-based agency. Not all of the capacity is
currently used after the group reduced output last year.  Saudi Arabia, which is currently producing about 8.3
million barrels a day, is forecast to have an average production
capacity of 12.08 million barrels a day this year and 12.04
million barrels a day in 2011, the IEA said. OPEC meets tomorrow
in Quito, Ecuador.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
