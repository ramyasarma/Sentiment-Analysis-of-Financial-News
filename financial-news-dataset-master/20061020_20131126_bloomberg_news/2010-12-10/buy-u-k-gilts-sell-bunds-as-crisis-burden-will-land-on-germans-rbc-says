Investors should buy 10-year gilts
and sell German bunds as the U.K. benefits from its fiscal
tightening while the euro-area’s debt crisis is likely to become
Germany’s burden, according to RBC Capital Markets.  The yield spread between the two bonds may narrow to 10
basis points by June next year from the current level of about
55 basis points, wrote RBC strategists including  Peter Schaffrik 
and Sam Hill.  “There is room for substantial spread movement between the
gilt and the bund markets, particularly in during the first half
of 2011,” wrote the strategists in a research note received
today. “Whilst we expect central banks to be on hold in each
respective currency area, bunds are likely to bear more of the
debt burden of the European periphery.”  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has pledged
to virtually eliminate the country’s 156 billion-pound ($247
billion) budget deficit by 2015.  German debt with maturities of 10 years or longer
outperformed gilts this year, handing investors a 13.6 percent
return compared with a 6 percent gain from U.K. securities that
are due during the same period, according to the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
