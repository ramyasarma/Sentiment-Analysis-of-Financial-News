Kenya postponed a plan to introduce
mobile-phone number portability by four months to April 1
because the country’s network operators are unprepared, the
 Daily Nation  reported, citing the industry regulator.  The service will allow mobile-phone users to retain their
number while switching to another network provider, the Nairobi-
based newspaper reported today, citing  Communications Commission
of Kenya  assistant public relations manager Christopher Wambua.  An agreement to delay the start date of the service was
reached at a meeting of all four of the country’s operators,
which includes Safaricom Ltd., the biggest, and Bharti Airtel
Ltd. Kenya, Wambua said in the statement, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
