Treasury 10-year notes fell, pushing
the yield toward its biggest weekly increase this year, as
better-than-estimated reports on consumer confidence and the
American trade deficit boosted optimism about the economy. The
euro fell against most major counterparts. Commodities slumped.  Yields on 10-year Treasuries rose four basis points to 3.25
percent at 10:34 a.m. New York time, up from 3.01 percent a week
ago. The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.3196 as leaders from
Germany and France said they are against increased funding to
quell the sovereign-debt crisis before next week’s summit of
European Union leaders.  S&P GSCI index  of 24 raw materials
dropped 0.4 percent after advancing as much as 0.9 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  swung  between gains and losses.  U.S. government bonds have tumbled this week amid
speculation President  Barack Obama ’s agreement with Republicans
to extend tax cuts enacted under his predecessor,  George W. Bush , will spur growth in the world’s largest economy and drive
down unemployment from the highest levels since the early 1980s.
The S&P 500 is poised to post its second straight weekly gain.  “Animal spirits are starting to come back,” said  Hank Smith , chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co., which
manages about $6.5 billion in Radnor, Pennsylvania. “That’s part
of a strengthening economy. The latest figures, including
consumer confidence, indicate that. It’s certainty replacing
uncertainty.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
