(Corrects location of Eagles-Cowboys game to Texas, in
third paragraph.)  Jerry Jones  said the Dallas Cowboys
have had such a bad year that even his friend  George Steinbrenner , the late owner of the New York Yankees, would have
fired him as general manager.  “Of course he would have,” the Cowboys’ owner said in an
interview to be aired Dec. 12 on CBS Corp.’s “60 Minutes.”
“There’s no doubt in my mind he would have.”  Jones last month replaced coach  Wade Phillips  after a 1-7
start to the season. Under  Jason Garrett , who was promoted from
offensive coordinator, the team has improved to 4-8. Dallas is
still in last place in the four-team National Football
Conference East Division and hosts the first-place
Philadelphia Eagles (8-4) on Dec. 12.  “Before this year started, we were recognized as probably
or certainly one of two that were favored to win the Super
Bowl,” Jones said. “What you’re seeing now is agony.”  Jones said the National Football League team, which he
bought 22 years ago, is “my devil, and I just couldn’t resist
it.” The Super Bowl will be held at Cowboys Stadium in
Arlington, Texas, on Feb. 6.  The last of Dallas’ three Super Bowl wins under Jones came
14 years ago and the team in January got its only playoff
victory since 1996.  “I am not willing to accept what we’re doing and how we’re
playing,” Jones said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
