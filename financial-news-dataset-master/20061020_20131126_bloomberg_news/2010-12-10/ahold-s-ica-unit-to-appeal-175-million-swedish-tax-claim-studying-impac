Royal Ahold NV ’s ICA AB joint
venture, the largest supermarket chain in Sweden, said it will
appeal against a 1.2 billion kronor ($175 million) tax claim and
is studying the impact on the company.  The claim stems from Sweden’s Tax Agency’s decision to deny
ICA deductions of interest of about 3.5 billion kronor,
Amsterdam-based  Ahold  and ICA’s other owner, Hakon Invest AB,
said today in separate statements. The tax authority’s decision
was backed by the County Administrative Court, ICA said.  “We’re going to analyze the ruling and see in what way it
will affect the company,” said ICA spokeswoman  Madelene
Gummesson  by telephone from Stockholm today. Ahold spokesman
 Jochem van de Laarschot  said the company isn’t commenting.  ICA took a  charge  of 747 million kronor in the second
quarter related to a separate tax claim. That  translated  into a
47 million-euro ($62.2 million) charge for Ahold, which has a 60
percent financial interest in ICA, causing second-quarter profit
at the Dutch owner of U.S. Stop & Shop grocery stores to miss
analysts’ estimates.  Hakon Invest , the Solna, Sweden-based  listed  investment
firm, owns 40 percent of ICA. Both Hakon Invest and Ahold have
equal voting control of the Swedish retailer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
