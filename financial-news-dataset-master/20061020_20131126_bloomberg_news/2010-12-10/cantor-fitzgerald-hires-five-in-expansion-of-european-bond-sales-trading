Cantor Fitzgerald LP, the bond
broker transforming itself into an investment bank, hired five
people in London to broaden its fixed-income sales and trading
business in Europe.  The firm hired  Brian Jensen  and  Mark Perry  from Conduit
Capital Markets Ltd. and  Geoffrey Snell  and  Luke Walton  from
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. for investment-grade
corporate bonds, according to  John Baldo , global head, fixed
income sales manager at Cantor.  Neill Keaney  has joined from
Citigroup Inc. to trade high-yield bonds.  New York-based Cantor, one of 18 primary dealers authorized
to trade U.S. government securities with the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, aims to more than double its staff in Europe
within two years from 180 as financial markets recover from the
worst recession since the Great Depression.  “We are quickly but selectively adding people,” Baldo
said in an interview.  Jensen will trade corporate bonds and Perry will focus on
debt of financial institutions. Snell and Walton will be
responsible for corporate and financial bond sales.  Since September 2009, Cantor has hired more than 20 people
for its asset-backed securities, high-yield debt and emerging
markets businesses. The expansion since 2008 into investment
banking and out of its traditional stronghold of bond brokering
has included new offices in São Paulo, Moscow, and Beijing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
