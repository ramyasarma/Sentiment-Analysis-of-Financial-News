Ghana ’s current account deficit
widened to  $1.8 billion  for the first nine months of the year,
Bank of Ghana Governor  Kwesi Amissah-Arthur  told reporters in
the capital, Accra, today.  The shortfall compares with a  $1 billion  current account
deficit for the same period last year. The West African nation’s
gross domestic product this year is expected to be 44.8 billion
cedis ($30.6 billion), 75 percent bigger than previously
thought, the Statistical Service said on Nov. 5, after changing
the way it measures sectors of the economy.  Economic growth slowed in 2009 after the government
embarked on an austerity program to bring down the budget
deficit. Ghana posted a current account deficit of about 7.9
percent of GDP last year, according to the previous data.  Amissah-Arthur said the financial and capital account for
the nine months had a surplus of $1.9 billion, boosted by $1.3
billion in foreign direct investment and $550 million in
portfolio investments. The financial and capital account balance
had a surplus of $1 billion for the same period last year.  Ghana’s trade balance for the nine months worsened by $332
million, due mainly to increased imports, he said. Exports grew
40 percent year-on-year to $5.9 billion, while imports grew 34
percent to $8 billion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
