BCE Inc. , Canada’s largest phone
company, raised its quarterly dividend by 7.7 percent for the
sixth increase in two years, giving the stock its biggest gain
in almost a year.  Holders of BCE common stock will receive 49.25 cents per
share April 15, boosting the annual payout to C$1.97 next year,
the Montreal-based company said today in a statement.  BCE also announced a voluntary C$750 million cash
contribution to its pension plan this month that will help
eliminate the pension funding deficit in 2014. The payment will
result in lower pension contributions in 2011, boosting adjusted
earnings by 3 cents a share.  Last quarter, BCE reported profit that dropped less than
analysts estimated and increased its cash holdings to C$1.19
billion from C$928 million in the second quarter. BCE, run by
Chief Executive Officer  George Cope , agreed in September to buy
the rest of broadcaster CTV that it didn’t already own for C$1.3
billion to distinguish the company from new wireless operators.  BCE, Canada’s second-largest wireless carrier after  Rogers
Communications Inc. , rose C$1.02, 2.9 percent, to C$36.09 at 4
p.m. New York time on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the most since
Dec. 17. The shares have gained 24 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
