Senwes Ltd., the company that
controls more than a quarter of South Africa’s grain-storage
facilities, said it will proceed with the listing of its shares
on Johannesburg’s stock exchange at a “later stage.”  Some conditions needed for the stock exchange-listing,
which also hinged on “prevailing” market conditions, have not
yet been fulfilled, the Klerksdorp, South Africa-based company
said in a statement published in the Business Day newspaper
today. It didn’t give more details.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
