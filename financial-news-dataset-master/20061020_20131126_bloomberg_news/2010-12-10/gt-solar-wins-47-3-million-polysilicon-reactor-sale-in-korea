GT Solar International Inc. , a
supplier of equipment for solar manufacturers, won a $47.3
million order for polysilicon reactors from Korea’s OCI Co.  The sale marks the third order from closely held OCI for
polysilicon-making equipment and will be included in the current
quarter, Merrimack, New Hampshire-based GT Solar said today in a
statement. Each reactor can produce more than 400 metric tons a
year of polysilicon, a basic ingredient in solar cells.  GT Solar gained 22 cents to $9.25 at 11:01 a.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market composite trading. The stock, which sold for $16.50
in a July 2008 initial public offer, has gained 64 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
