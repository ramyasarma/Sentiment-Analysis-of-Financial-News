Negotiators at the United Nations
climate talks proposed new methods for developers to create
tradable carbon credits, the International Emission Traders
Association said.  “The headline success is standardized baseline, probably
in the transport, buildings and agriculture industries,”  Kim Carnahan , an emission offset specialist at Geneva-based IETA,
said today in an interview in Cancun, Mexico.  “Standardized baselines” should make it easier to
determine which projects are eligible for credits, according to
a draft published the talks. Factories and power stations may get
credits for activities that emit below such baselines.
Currently, projects are approved on a case-by-case basis, and
must show they need credits in order to go ahead. That approval
process has caused delays.  “Its difficult to tell what the impact on supply will
be,” Carnahan said. Issuance of credits for standardized
projects may be delivered “more than a year” from now, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
