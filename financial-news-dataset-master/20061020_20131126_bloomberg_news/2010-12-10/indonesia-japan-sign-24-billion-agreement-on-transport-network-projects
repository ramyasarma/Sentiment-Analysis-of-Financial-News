Indonesia and Japan signed an
agreement to build infrastructure valued at up to 2 trillion yen
($24 billion) in Jakarta as the Southeast Asian nation seeks to
improve transport links to spur economic development.  Projects under the agreement include a mass rapid transit
system to serve the greater Jakarta metropolitan area,
developing power plants and a clean water supply,  Hatta Rajasa ,
Indonesia’s coordinating minister for the economy, said in a
 statement . Development is expected to start in 2013, the
statement said.  “The greater Jakarta area is a priority because it’s the
country’s largest industrial area,” Rajasa said in the
statement, which was posted on the official website of President
 Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .  Rajasa signed the so-called Metropolitan Priority Area
agreement with Japanese Foreign Minister  Seiji Maehara  today in
Bali, Indonesia. Development is expected to start in 2013, with
financing provided by local and foreign companies and through
loans, the statement said.  The proposed mass rapid transit system in Jakarta will have
a 110 kilometer-long (68 miles) track network to serve commuters
from surrounding areas, according to information on the website
of  PT MRT Jakarta , the company overseeing the construction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
