Cities and other local governments
may see property-tax revenue decline, forcing some to consider
defaulting on debt and seeking bankruptcy protection, the
Congressional Budget Office said in a report.  A 27 percent decline in housing values from June 2006
through June 2010 hasn’t yet driven down tax rolls of cities,
counties and school districts as property collections rose 31
percent during the same period, the budget office said in  the
Dec. 9 report . That is expected to change, because property
taxes, which generate a fourth of revenue, lag behind changes in
home prices by three years, the report said.  “Collections will probably fall in the coming years as
local governments gradually update property-tax assessments to
reflect lower market values,” said the report, prepared by
Elizabeth Cove Delisle.  Falling tax revenue could force issuers to examine default
and protections offered by Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, the report said. Chapter 9 offers court protection from
creditors, and allows municipalities to restructure debt,
negotiate for lower labor costs and make changes without the
approval of all creditors, the report said.  Local governments include 3,000 counties, 36,000 cities and
towns, 37,400 special districts and 14,600 public-school
systems, the report said. They get nearly one-third of their
revenue from state aid while less than 4 percent comes from the
U.S. government, it said.  Only 54 of the 18,400 municipal-bond issuers rated by
Moody’s Investors Service from 1970 to 2009 defaulted, the
report said. Since 1988, only 170 local governments have filed
for bankruptcy.  Moody’s Investors Service predicted in October that
bankruptcies by local governments would remain rare because of
the costs and limits on filings in more than half the states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
