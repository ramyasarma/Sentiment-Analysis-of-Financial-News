Bangladesh said envoys from 193
nations at United Nations global warming talks have agreed to
set up a fund that would channel aid to developing nations
adapting to the effects of global warming and adopt low-carbon
technology  “It’s been agreed that we will establish the fund,”
Quamrul Chowdhury, leads negotiations on finance issues for a
bloc of nations called the Least Developed Countries, said today
in an interview in Cancun, where two weeks of climate
negotiations are due to finish today.  Chowdhury said a committee may be set up to work out the
details of the fund, which may channel up to $100 billion of aid
by 2020, over the next year.  “The major stumbling blocks are the modalities of the fund
-- who will be the trustee, the composition of the board,” he
said. Finance talks went through the night yesterday, ending at
6 a.m. today, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
