Qualcomm Inc. , the largest maker of
chips that run mobile phones, plans to shut its wireless FLO TV
service in March and will offer rebates to subscribers who
bought related products for program viewing.  The company had previously said it would stop taking new
subscriptions after the venture failed to meet its targets.
Qualcomm has held talks with  AT&T Inc.  about a possible sale of
the wireless spectrum it bought to create FLO, two people with
knowledge of the discussions said last month.  FLO was an attempt by Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer  Paul Jacobs  to diversify the company’s sources of revenue outside
chips and licensing and stoke general demand for television on
the go. Consumers proved less attracted by FLO’s live
programming than by shows that can be viewed on-demand, the
executive said in an interview Nov. 17.  Qualcomm paid $683 million for rights to use the needed
airwaves -- in the 700 megahertz band -- in federal auctions
from 2003 to 2008, and started Flo TV in 2004 to let users watch
broadcast TV on their mobile phones. Qualcomm made the rebate
and closure announcement on FLO’s website. In November the
company said it expected to incur charges of $125 million to
$175 million in fiscal 2011 to exit the Flo TV business.  Qualcomm rose 40 cents to $49.48 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . It has gained 7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
