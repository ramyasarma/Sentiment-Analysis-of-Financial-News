Nokian Renkaat Oyj , the Nordic
region’s largest tire maker, plans to start building another
factory in about a year to meet surging demand amid a recovering
auto market, Chief Executive Officer  Kim Gran  said.  “We have presently only one problem and that is lack of
capacity,” Gran said in a phone interview today from the
company’s headquarters in Nokia, Finland. “We have to start
building a factory by the end of 2011 or start of 2012.”  The company, specialized in premium winter tires, is
weighing whether to locate the factory near its existing plant
in St. Petersburg, Russia, or somewhere in eastern Europe, Gran
said. It will decide on the location in the first half of 2011,
he said, adding the plant will cost about 200 million euros
($265 million).  Nokian Renkaat is benefiting as car sales gain after the
financial crisis. About 70.3 million cars will be built
worldwide in 2010, up from 57.4 million last year, IHS
Automotive forecasts. In Russia, where Nokian Renkaat  generates 
about one-fifth of sales, car deliveries rose 80 percent in
November, the most in two years, as the economy rebounded and
the government extended its rebate program for used vehicles.  The new factory’s annual capacity will be at least six
million tires, Gran said.  Nokian Renkaat  will expand production
at its Russian plant next year to 11 million tires from the
current 8 million, he said. Its second factory, at the Nokia
headquarters, is “running at full speed” to meet its annual
production rate of 5 million tires, Gran, 56, said.  Nokian Renkaat’s third-quarter profit  rose  25 percent to
34.5 million euros. The tire maker plans to add at least 400
employees next year in Russia and Finland to its current
workforce of 3,500, he said. Nokian Renkaat was split off from
 Nokia Oyj , the world’s biggest maker of mobile phones, in 1988.  To contact the reporter on this story:
