Incoming U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner , saying reduced government spending begins at home,
promised to seek a 5 percent cut in the chamber’s legislative
budget as one of the first steps when Republicans take control
next year.  Republicans, who captured the House from Democrats in the
November election with a net gain of 63 seats, campaigned on a
pledge to decrease government spending to 2008 levels. That
would require Congress to find $100 billion in cuts next year.  “We should start with ourselves,” Boehner, 61, said in an
interview taped for  CBS’s “60 Minutes”  program that airs Dec.
12. “How about we start with cutting Congress?”  The Ohio Republican said he planned to “cut my leadership
budget 5 percent” and “cut all the leadership budgets by 5
percent.” He said, “I am going to cut every committee’s budget
by 5 percent and every member is going to see a 5 percent
reduction in their allowance.”  This would save the taxpayers $25 million to $30 million,
he said. “We have to start somewhere,” Boehner said when asked
how such a relatively small amount would make a difference in an
annual federal  deficit  that totaled about $1.3 trillion this
year.  Boehner, who will take office Jan. 5 when the new Congress
convenes, said the House will debate a measure to cut spending
every week for the first three months of 2011.  “We don’t need 2,000-page bills,” he said. “We don’t
need thousand-page bills. How about one page?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
