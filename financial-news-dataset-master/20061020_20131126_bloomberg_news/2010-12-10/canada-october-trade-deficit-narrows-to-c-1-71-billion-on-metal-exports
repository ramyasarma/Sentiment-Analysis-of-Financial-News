Canada’s  trade deficit  narrowed more
than economists predicted in October, as exports of copper and
precious metals rose to a record. The surplus with the U.S.
narrowed to the smallest since 1992.  The total deficit shrank to C$1.71 billion ($1.69 billion)
in October from a revised C$2.31 billion the month before,
Ottawa-based Statistics Canada said today. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg predicted an October deficit of C$2.1 billion,
according to the median of 24 estimates.  Canada has registered six straight deficits, including the
record C$2.51 billion gap set in July, as a strong currency and
uneven global demand curb exports and encourage companies to
import equipment to regain competitiveness. Bank of Canada
Governor Mark Carney left his main interest rate at 1 percent
Dec. 7 and said policy makers will remain careful about future
increases as trade and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis hinder the
economic recovery.  Exports  rose 3.1 percent to C$33.8 billion in October, led
by a 13.7 percent jump for industrial goods to C$8.9 billion,
Statistics Canada said today. Metal and alloy shipments rose
17.8 percent, led by precious metals and copper.  Imports  rose 1.2 percent to C$35.5 billion, as energy
shipments increased 8.3 percent to C$3.4 billion.  The  surplus  with the U.S., Canada’s largest trade partner,
narrowed to C$1.13 billion in October, the lowest since
September 1992, from C$1.43 billion the prior month.  Export volumes rose 3 percent, while prices gained 0.1
percent on the month. Imports, meantime, climbed 1.7 percent in
volume terms and fell 0.5 percent in price terms, the agency
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
