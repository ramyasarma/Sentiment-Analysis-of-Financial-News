You’ll need to prepare yourself for
Friday night at Terminal 5 when DJ Paulie D spins his magic.  Freshly G and T’d, wearing clean L, the fiercely-coiffed
Jersey Boy himself will supply the beats.  We all know what to expect: fist-pumping, grinding,
deshabille and loud swearing.  Since it’s hard to know how ironic the audience will be,
make sure to wear your sunnies at night.  At 610 W. 56th St. Information: +1-212-582-6600;
 http://www.terminal5nyc.com/   After emerging from the dance hall, take yourself to Press
Lounge, the rooftop bar at the  Ink48 hotel .  Get a cocktail and join the glam crowd. Your recent
excursion into B&T madness will begin to fade.  At 653 11th Ave. Information: +1-212-757-2224.  Also Tonight  Join gun-toting diva  Deborah Voigt  at the Polka Saloon
where she dispenses whiskey and advice to weepy miners in the
revival of “La Fanciulla del West” (The Girl of the Golden
West) at the Metropolitan Opera.  With a gleaming high C and charm to spare, she rides a
horse and cheats at cards to save her bandit from the evil
clutches of the jealous sheriff.  Puccini’s sweetly sophisticated ode to the 1840s Gold Rush
is splendidly captured in the Met’s grandly scaled, wonderfully
atmospheric production from the early 1990s.  Marcello Giordani, topped off by a mighty cowboy hat and
decorated with a dainty moustache, sings lustily as the bandit
with the opera’s most famous tune.  Lucio Gallo broods darkly as the unappreciated sheriff.
 Nicola Luisotti  conducts with enthusiasm.  Tonight is “Fanciulla’s” 100th birthday -- the world
premiere took place at the Metropolitan Opera with Enrico Caruso
onstage, Arturo Toscanini in the pit and Puccini himself coming
out for a bow or two. So a toast is in order: “Whiskey per
tutti!”  Lincoln Center, Broadway at 66th St. Information: +1-212-
362-2000;  http://www.metoperafamily.org/   Saturday Afternoon  Visit the fantastic Neapolitan creche and Christmas tree at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Lighting ceremonies take place
at 4:30, 5:30 and 6:30 p.m.  Some 50 silk-robed angels spread their wings in the blue
spruce. At its base, adoring the holy newborn, are shepherds and
their flocks, with exotic Magi on the way, all surrounded by
colorful townspeople, peasants and assorted animals.  For something more secular, visit “Stieglitz, Steichen and
Strand” with its erotic photographs of  Georgia O’Keeffe  with
her shirt open.  Next door is an accompanying show of photographs from the
1910s witnessing a new epoch as motorcars and airplanes
confounded conventional notions of time and space.  Information: +1-212-535-7710;  http://www.metmuseum.org   Saturday Evening  Experience two artists for the price of one in “Pass the
Blutwurst, Bitte” as John Kelly channels Austrian painter Egon
Schiele in all his lustful, transgressive glory.  This is billed as the last “blutletting” of the blood
wurst after much touring and an Obie.  So focused was Schiele on flesh and mortality that he was
jailed as a pornographer. Though he died at 28, the artist had
the last laugh -- a 1915 work of his sold at auction in 2006 for
more than $22 million.  “Pass the Blutwurst, Bitte” is at La Mama until Dec.
19th. Curtain goes up at 7:30 p.m.  74A E. 4th St, between Bowery and 2nd Ave. Information: +1-
212-475-7710;  http://lamama.org/   Sunday  Hear holiday classics superbly played by the New York
Philharmonic Brass Quintet and the  West Point Band , which can
trace its roots to the Revolutionary War.  All members of the band are active soldiers and most come
with degrees from conservatories such as Juilliard, Curtis and
the Eastman School.  Master Sergeant MaryKay Messenger and Staff Sergeant Alexis
Cole provide the vocals.  The concerts are at noon and at 3 p.m. at Avery Fisher
Hall, Lincoln Center, Broadway and 66th St. Information: +1-212-
875-5656;  http://nyphil.org/   Sunday Afternoon  In this revival of “A Hard Nut,”  Mark Morris  dances the
part of Dr. Stahlbaum, a promotion from his usual appearance as
a drunken guest.  His amusing riff on “The Nutcracker” updates the action
to 1970s America, with adults misbehaving at a liquor-fueled
Christmas party.  In addition to the Nutcracker, Mouse King, and Sugar Plum
Fairy, there are fighting G.I. Joes, adorable Barbies, aluminum
robots, swinging guitar players and unisex snowflakes.  Tchaikovsky’s gorgeous music is intact.  At 3 p.m. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Ave.,
Brooklyn. Information: +1-718-636-4100;  http://www.bam.org/   (With assistance from  Lili Rosboch .  Zinta Lundborg  is an
