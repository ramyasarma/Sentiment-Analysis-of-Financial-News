Kenya’s shilling snapped a two-day
decline against the U.S. dollar as the central bank refrained
from buying foreign exchange.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
as much as 0.8 percent to 79.82 and was trading at 79.87 by 3:28
p.m. in Nairobi. It closed at 80.53 yesterday.  “The central bank has been out of the market; that has
resulted in low demand for dollars in the market,” Mark Orubia,
a trader at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone
interview today. “As we head toward Christmas, the shilling will
strengthen as corporate wind up for the year.”  On Dec. 8, the  Central Bank of Kenya  bought 5 million euros
($6.62 million) at an average rate of 106.632. The central bank
said in a statement today it was staying out of both the repo
and foreign-exchange markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
