OPEC’s compliance with record supply
cuts was little changed last month as production declines in
five of its member countries offset increases in Saudi Arabia,
Qatar and Iran, the International Energy Agency said.  The 11 members bound by quotas produced 26.76 million
barrels a day last month, implying compliance of 54 percent, the
Paris-based IEA said today in its monthly report. That’s
unchanged from a revised 54 percent for October. Supply from all
12 nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
including Iraq, rose by 50,000 barrels a day in November to
average 29.24 million barrels daily, it said.  OPEC, responsible for about 40 percent of world crude
supply, will meet next tomorrow in Quito, Ecuador. The group
kept output quotas unchanged at an Oct. 14 meeting in Vienna.  “OPEC ministers are unlikely to address compliance issues
or target allocations,” the IEA said. “Pre-meeting statements
by OPEC ministers suggest the group is planning on a quick
agreement to roll over existing output targets, despite the
unexpected jump in global oil demand in second-half 2010 and
sharp price increases since they last met.”  OPEC announced its biggest ever production cuts in late
2008 as global demand collapsed. The decision set a cap at
24.845 million barrels a day for 11 of its members. Adherence to
the reduction eased last year as prices rebounded 78 percent.  Saudi Arabia  The compliance percentages are calculated based on the 11
nations targeting a 4.2 million barrel-a-day reduction from a
base production rate of 29.045 million barrels a day in
September 2008.  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, produced 8.34
million barrels a day in November, up 100,000 barrels a day from
October, the IEA estimated.  Nigeria’s November output fell to 2.12 million barrels a
day, down 80,000 barrels a day from October, after a surge of
militant activity in the Niger Delta region disrupted flows of
Bonny crude through the Trans-Niger pipeline, the IEA said.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
