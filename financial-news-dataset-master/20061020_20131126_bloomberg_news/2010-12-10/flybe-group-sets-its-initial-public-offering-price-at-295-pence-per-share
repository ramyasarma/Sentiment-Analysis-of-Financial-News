Flybe Group Plc, the U.K.’s biggest
domestic airline since it bought assets of British Airways Plc
in 2007, surged 16 percent today after its shares began trading
on the London Stock Exchange.  Flybe  advanced  46.25 pence from the offer price of 295
pence to close at 341.25 pence. That values the Exeter, England-
based company at 248.6 million pounds ($393 million).  About 20.3 million new shares were sold, representing 28
percent of the total in issue, Flybe said in a statement. The
carrier, whose regional aircraft serve less busy routes than
larger jetliners, said it will use half of the 60 million pounds
raised to buy 35 more planes and the rest to fund “growth
opportunities” including acquisitions.  The price for the initial public offering was toward the
bottom end of a 285 pence to 385 pence range, according to terms
of the deal previously obtained by Bloomberg News.  Chief Executive Officer  Jim French  said on Sept. 20 he was
in talks over two purchases to add bases in continental Europe.
Flybe’s pretax profit fell 47 percent to 6.8 million pounds in
the year ended March 31 as the recession hurt demand, prompting
fare cuts. Passenger numbers dropped 1.3 percent to 7.2 million.  Founded in 1979 as Jersey European Airways after the island
in the English Channel to which it flew, the company was renamed
British European in 2000. It took on its current identity two
years later after switching to a low-cost strategy.  BA Purchase  Flybe acquired British Airways’  BA Connect unit  for 521
million pounds in 2006, adding more than 50 routes and doubling
the number of customers to become No. 1 in Europe’s regional
market, where smaller planes serve secondary routes.  The company ordered 35 88-seat Embraer 175 regional jets
valued at $1.3 billion in July from Brazil’s Empresa Brasileira
de Aeronautica SA, together with options for 65 planes and
“purchase rights” for a further 40. The current fleet consists
of 14 Embraer 195 jets and 54 Bombardier Inc. Q400 turboprops.  Following the share sale, the family trust of the late
steel tycoon Jack Walker owns 49.6 percent of Flybe stock, down
from 69 percent, with employees holding about 8 percent and
directors 7 percent, Flybe said in the statement.  British Airways , Europe’s third-largest carrier, bought
enough shares to maintain a 15 percent stake.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the sole sponsor and
bookrunner on the IPO, was granted an over-allotment option of
as many as 2.03 million shares, exercisable for 30 days.
Investec and Execution Noble were lead managers on the offer.  Following conditional dealings Flybe will be admitted to
the LSE’s main market on Dec. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
