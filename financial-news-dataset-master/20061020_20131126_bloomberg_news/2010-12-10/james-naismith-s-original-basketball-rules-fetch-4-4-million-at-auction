The original rules of basketball,
written by  James Naismith  in 1891, were auctioned today for $4.4
million at Sotheby’s in New York.  The 13 rules are on a two-page typed document with
Naismith’s handwritten notes. Samantha Dye, a  Sotheby’s  employee
who reported the winning bid in a telephone interview, declined
to identify the buyer.  The Associated Press said the pre-sale estimate for the
rules was $2 million.  The document includes Naismith’s signature, added in 1931,
and an afterword noting it was “hung in the gym so the boys
might learn the rules,” according to a  video  on the Sotheby’s
website.  Naismith, a Canadian-born physical education instructor,
wrote the rules for a YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts. The
guidelines later were expanded to form the framework of the
modern game.  The 119-year-old rules were sold to raise money for the
 Naismith International Basketball Foundation , which uses the
game to promote sportsmanship and other educational
opportunities to underprivileged children, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
