Natural gas futures fell for a
second day as forecasts showed that cold weather in the eastern
U.S. will moderate next week.  Gas declined 0.4 percent as weather east of the Mississippi
River will not be as cold as earlier forecast from Dec. 15 to
Dec. 19, according to the National Weather Service. U.S. gas
inventories were 9.8 percent above the five-year average in the
week ended Dec. 3, according to the Energy Department.  “There is a little bit of moderation in the weather right
now and people are waiting to see what the catalyst is going to
be to set the next direction,” said  Brad Florer , a trader at
Kottke Associates Inc., an energy trading firm in Louisville,
Kentucky. “Storage is still a problem. It makes the upside
limited.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 1.8 cents to settle
at $4.417 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The futures gained 1.6 percent this week
and have dropped 21 percent this year.  The number of U.S. gas drilling rigs fell by 13 to 948 this
week, according to Baker Hughes Inc. The rig total is up 25
percent from a year ago.  Weather models “are in fair agreement on the moderation
trend” in the 6-to-10 day forecast, according to Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  New York will have a low of 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0
Celsius) on Dec. 17, 1 degree above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania. Boston will
have a low of 26 degrees, 1 degree below normal.  Weather Impact  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  “Cold temperatures have given the market support but if
they recede the market could have little to hold it up,” said
Shiyang Wang, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, in a
note to clients today.  The Energy Department said yesterday stockpiles dropped 89
billion cubic feet in the week ended Dec. 3 to 3.725 trillion
cubic feet.  Last week’s storage decline was bigger than the five-year
average drop for the week of 74 billion cubic feet, department
data showed. A deficit to year-earlier supplies widened to 1.5
percent from 0.6 percent.  “Given how cold it is right now, we are going to see a
very big storage withdrawal” in next week’s inventory report,
said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc., a
consulting company in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “It’s still a
weather play.”  Production Estimate  Gas output will average a record 62.09 billion cubic feet a
day this year, the department said in its monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook report on Dec. 7. Prices for gas at the benchmark
Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, will average $4.37 per million
Btu this year and $4.33 next year, according to the report.  Henry Hub gas declined 15.59 cents, or 3.5 percent, to
$4.3679 per million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange today.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
265,989 as of 2:36 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
282,000. Volume was 453,908 yesterday. Open interest was 764,400
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 792,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  Volume reached a record high of 471,513 on Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
