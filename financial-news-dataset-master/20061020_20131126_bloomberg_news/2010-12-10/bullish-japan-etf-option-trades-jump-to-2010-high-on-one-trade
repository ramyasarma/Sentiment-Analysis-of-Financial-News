Trading of bullish  options  on
Japanese stocks jumped to the highest this year in U.S. trading
after a single bet that companies in the world’s third-largest
economy will advance in the next 12 months.  A single trade of 50,000 January 2012 $11 calls to buy the
iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund helped boost volume for the
bullish contracts to 10 times the four-week average and 15 times
the number of puts to sell as of 4 p.m. in New York. The
exchange-traded fund fell 0.3 percent to $10.58, near its  seven-
month high  of $10.69 reached Dec. 6.  Japan’s economy expanded more than the government initially
calculated in the third quarter because of a bigger-than-
reported increase in capital spending. Gross domestic product
grew at an annualized 4.5 percent rate, faster than the 3.9
percent reported last month, the Cabinet Office said Dec. 9.  “Someone could be looking at this as a possible indicator
that Japan is poised for a strong 2011,” said  Steve Oh , an ETF
sales trader at Newedge Group in New York. “Especially coming
on the heels of the stimulus package.”  Japan’s lower house of parliament on Nov. 16 approved
legislation to fund a 5.1 trillion yen ($61 billion) stimulus.  Nikkei Drops  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.7 percent to
10,211.95 today. Most Asian stocks fell amid speculation Chinese
policy makers would raise interest rates to slow inflation in
the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The Nikkei has lost
4.2 percent this year, compared with a 9.4 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The contracts accounted for most of the 57,080 calls and
3,193 puts on the ETF changing hands today. The block of calls
traded at 1:08 p.m. New York time at 69 cents, which means that
the buyer paid $3.45 million.  “It’s an opening trade and they want to hold the position
for several months at least to benefit from anything in Asia
that would drive the Japanese market higher,” said  Etai Friedman , head derivatives trader at MKM Partners LP in
Stamford, Connecticut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
