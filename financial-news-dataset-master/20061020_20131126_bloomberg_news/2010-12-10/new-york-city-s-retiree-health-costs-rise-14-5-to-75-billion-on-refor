New York City’s liability for its
retired workers’ future medical care last year rose 14.5 percent
to $75 billion due to national health reform, according to the
city’s  annual financial report .  Post-employment benefit costs apart from pensions increased
$9.4 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, compared
with growth of $2.3 billion in fiscal 2009, the report said.
Future health costs for the city’s more than 300,000 employees
and 237,000 retirees also rose because the state extended
temporary coverage for those who lost jobs to 36 months from 18.  The city, which has proposed cutting its workforce by more
than 10,000 as it faces a budget deficit next year of as much as
$4.5 billion, hasn’t succeeded in getting current employees and
retirees to contribute toward health care.  “It’s an expense that is eating up more and more of the
budget every year,”  Marc LaVorgna , spokesman for Mayor  Michael Bloomberg , said in an e-mail. “ The mayor has made proposals to
reduce the cost to the taxpayers, but we have not gotten the
cooperation we need from labor leadership.”  The city attributed the increased medical care costs, in
part to the national health-care law’s expanded coverage for
adult children to age 26 from 19, or 23 if a full-time student.  The cost of retirement benefits outstrips the city’s $42.4
billion unfunded pension liability, according to the report. New
York City had set aside $3.1 billion to pay future retiree
health care as of June 30, 2009, the report said.  The city also has $68.7 billion in  outstanding bonds  and
notes payable.  Taxpayer and investor concern about U.S. municipal finances
has grown as the recession has battered tax revenue and states
and local governments spend more on pensions and health care
than on education, public safety and clean water.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
