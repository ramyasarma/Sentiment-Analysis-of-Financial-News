Rentokil Initial Plc  Chief Executive
Officer  Alan Brown  has taken over the day-to-day running of City
Link in a bid to stem losses at its parcel-delivery business.  Stuart Godman  quit by mutual agreement, the London-based
company said in a statement today. Godman is the second City
Link manager to leave in 18 months.  Widespread snow and freezing conditions have hampered
Rentokil’s efforts to return the courier business to profit. The
company flagged today that City Link’s full-year  performance  is
“unlikely to improve” from the prior year, though the group’s
overall outlook for profit remains unchanged.  “The difficult trading conditions experienced by the
business in the third quarter are continuing in the run-up to
Christmas,” Rentokil said in the statement. City Link’s
shortfall will be “largely compensated by performance elsewhere
in the group.”  The company said Nov. 5 that City Link would break even at
best, after earlier in the year signalling that the overhaul of
the business was proceeding according to plan.  Brown, the former chief financial officer of Imperial
Chemical Industries, will run the unit until a successor is
appointed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
