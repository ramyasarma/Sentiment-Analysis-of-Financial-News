The International Energy Agency
raised its 2011 global crude oil demand forecast for a third
month on consumption gains in North America and China.  Crude use worldwide will average 88.8 million barrels a day
next year, about 260,000 barrels more than its previous
forecast, the Paris-based adviser said today in its monthly Oil
Market Report. Increasing demand could put pressure on OPEC to
boost supply early next year, the IEA said.  Oil traded at the highest level in more than two years this
week amid evidence of global economic recovery. U.S. jobless
claims fell a more-than-forecast 17,000 to 421,000 last week,
the Labor Department said yesterday. China’s manufacturing grew
at a faster pace for a fourth straight month in November. The
Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 55.2 from 54.7 in October,
China’s logistics federation said on its website on Dec. 1.  “Against a backdrop of much stronger-than-expected global
oil demand growth and oil prices above two-year highs, OPEC may
come under pressure to increase supplies to the market in the
new year,” IEA said in the report.  Demand for crude has been rising since the third quarter of
2009 led by developing economies, according to the IEA. Asian
demand growth continues to “dwarf” all other regions, the IEA
said, with China accounting for about half of the growth outside
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  “Global demand grew by a giddy 3.3 million barrels a day
year-on-year in the third quarter,” according to the report.
Demand growth in North America has been “remarkably strong” in
the past two quarters, the IEA said.  Chinese Strength  Chinese demand rose by 12.6 percent in October compared
with the year-earlier period. “The strength of China’s oil
demand is consistent with other indicators suggesting that the
economy is in danger of overheating,” the agency said. OECD
demand could fall by 300,000 barrels a day between now and 2015,
according to the report.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
accounts for about 40 percent of global supply, will meet
tomorrow in Quito, Ecuador, to review output quotas.  OPEC producers, which include Saudi Arabia and Iran, will
need to produce 29.5 million barrels a day next year, the IEA
said. That’s 260,000 barrels a day more than current levels and
100,000 barrels above the IEA’s last forecast, it said.  OPEC Capacity  The group’s production capacity will rise to 36.94 million
barrels a day by 2015, 150,000 barrels more than previously
forecast, as Nigeria and Iraq boost output, the IEA said. Iraq
has the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves, excluding deposits
in its semi-autonomous northern Kurdish territory, according to
data from BP Plc.  OPEC’s compliance with record supply cuts was little
changed last month at 54 percent of the agreed 4.2 million
barrels a day, the IEA said.  Next year’s estimate for non-OPEC supply was unchanged at
53.4 million barrels a day. Russia, currently the world’s
largest producer, isn’t a member of OPEC.  Looking further ahead, the IEA raised its forecast for
global oil demand for 2015 to 93.4 million barrels a day. That
compares with the 91.93 million barrel-a-day estimate released
in June. Emerging markets will account for more than half of
global crude demand as early as 2013, it said.  Oil rose 6.5 percent last week, the biggest weekly gain in
a month, after reports showed manufacturing grew in Europe and
China, prompting  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  Deutsche Bank AG 
to increase their oil price forecasts for 2011 and 2012.  Hedge Funds  Hedge funds increased bullish bets on oil by the most in
eight weeks in the seven days ended Nov. 30, according to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments of
Traders report.  The “plausible foundation for price strength lies with now
apparent third-quarter fundamentals,” the IEA said today.
“Upward demand revisions have outstripped those for supply.”  Industry-held  crude stockpiles  in the world’s developed
economies increased by 700,000 barrels a day to 2.745 billion
barrels.  Crude oil for January delivery advanced 22 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $88.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange
as of 10:07 a.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
