Rafael Nadal  will model underwear
and jeans for  Giorgio Armani SpA  next year, the Italian fashion
company said.  The first campaign starring the reigning French Open,
Wimbledon and U.S. Open tennis champion will be introduced in
February, Armani said in an e-mailed statement.  Nadal, whose victory at the  U.S. Open  in September made him
the youngest man since tennis turned professional to have won
all four majors, is following in the footsteps of soccer stars
 David Beckham  and  Cristiano Ronaldo  in endorsing the Milan-based
brand.  The 24-year-old lefthander from the Spanish island of
Majorca earned $21 million over the previous 12 months from
prize money and sponsorships with companies led by  Mapfre SA ,
Spain’s largest insurer; South Korea’s Kia Motors Corp.; French
racket manufacturer  Babolat ; and Nike Inc., Forbes Magazine said
in August. The sport’s highest earner is 16-time Grand Slam
singles champion  Roger Federer , whose annual earnings Forbes
estimated at $43 million.  Armani in July said profit fell 28 percent last year
because of the recession in North America and Japan. Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization dropped to
218 million euros ($288 million) from 303.2 million euros in
2008.  Targeting the U.S. market “is going to be our focus,”
 Fernando Soler , head of the tennis division at  IMG Worldwide
Inc.  which represents Nadal, said in an interview shortly after
the Spaniard won his first title in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
