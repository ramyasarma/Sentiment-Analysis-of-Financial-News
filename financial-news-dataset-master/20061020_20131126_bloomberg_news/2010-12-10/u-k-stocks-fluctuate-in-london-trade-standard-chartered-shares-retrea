The U.K.’s benchmark  FTSE 100 Index 
closed at a three-week high as a rally in mining companies
helped offset a retreat in Standard Chartered Plc and Associated
British Foods Plc.  Vedanta Resources Plc and Xstrata Plc both gained more than
1 percent as copper advanced in London.  Standard Chartered 
dropped 2.6 percent after BofA Merrill Lynch downgraded the
bank. AB Foods fell 1.3 percent after the company said higher
commodity costs would affect its Primark stores.  The  FTSE 100 Index  rose 4.99, or 0.1 percent, to 5,812.95
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, after swinging between gains
and losses more than 10 times today. The gauge has this week
climbed 1.2 percent for a second weekly advance. The  FTSE All-
Share Index  also rose 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ
Index  fell 0.5 percent.  “There hasn’t been much in the way of fresh fundamentals
to provide additional direction,” said London-based Ben
Critchley, a sales trader at IG Index. “The FTSE could still be
in with a chance of testing the big 6,000 level before the year
end, although any quick bout of profit-taking would easily push
such prospects well into the New Year.”  Vedanta climbed 3.2 percent to 2,275 pence as copper rose
in London after imports of the metal into China gained for the
first time in three months. Xstrata increased 1.5 percent to
1,441 pence and Kazakhmys Plc rose 1.1 percent to 1,529 pence.  Anglo American also advanced, gaining 1.1 percent to
3,027.5 pence. The company, which has suffered delays and cost
overruns at its biggest project, said it secured another “key”
license it needs to start operations at its Minas-Rio iron ore
project. The company secured another two licenses in October.  Standard Chartered dropped 2.6 percent to 1,762.5 pence
after BofA Merrill Lynch downgraded the U.K.-based bank to
“neutral” from “buy.” The stock yesterday dropped 3.6
percent after Standard Chartered said second-half “income
levels” will be “broadly flat” from the previous six months.  AB Foods, Vedanta  AB Foods retreated 1.3 percent to 1,091 pence after the
owner of Primark said higher commodity prices will affect
margins at the discount clothes stores. The company said overall
trading results for the first two months of the new financial
year were in line with expectations.  Burberry Group Plc dropped 2.6 percent to 1,108 pence as
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said the U.K.’s largest luxury retailer is
too big for PPR SA. The stock rallied earlier in the week on
investor speculation that PPR, the French owner of the Gucci and
Puma brands, may make a bid.  JPMorgan analysts said PPR would have to sell all of their
retail assets to pay for the speculated price of 1,500 pence per
shares.  Heritage Oil Plc fell 1.6 percent to 420.4 pence, erasing
an earlier advance of as much as 3.4 percent. Petroliam Nasional
Bhd, Malaysia’s state-owned oil and gas company, denied the
Daily Mail’s report about a 1.71 billion pounds ($2.7 billion)
cash bid for U.K.-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
