Japanese  stocks  declined for the
first time in three days after a downgrade to Ireland’s credit
rating fueled concern Europe’s debt crisis will spread and as
the euro weakened.  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s biggest carmaker, sank 1.4
percent. Fanuc Ltd., Japan’s largest maker of industrial robots,
slumped 1.9 percent. Mitsui & Co., a trading house that counts
commodities as its biggest source of profit, declined 1.7
percent after metal prices fell on speculation China will act to
control inflation in the world’s fastest growing major economy.
Komatsu Ltd., which counts China as its fastest-growing market,
tumbled 2.2 percent.  “Investors are entering holiday mode and aren’t in a mood
to aggressively buy shares and take risks,” said  Ayako Sera , a
strategist in Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which
manages about $310 billion. The market is reflecting a “halt to
the yen’s weakening.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.7 percent to 10,211.95
as of the close in Tokyo. The Topix lost 0.4 percent to 888.22,
with about 8.5 shares dropping for every 6.5 shares that gained.
The Nikkei 225 gained 0.3 percent this week, rising for a six
consecutive week. The Topix had a 1 percent advance this week.  The Topix has tumbled 11 percent from its high this year on
April 15 as Europe’s debt crisis, China’s steps to curb property
prices and concern about U.S. economic growth damped confidence
in a global recovery. Shares in the index are valued at 15.4
times  estimated earnings  on average, compared with 14.5 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.3 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Weaker Euro  The 25-day  Toraku  index, a measure of daily stock winners
and losers on the Topix, rose to 163 yesterday, the most since
at least March 1992. A level of more than 120 suggests to some
investors the market is poised to fall.  “Investors may sell shares to lock in profit before the
weekend on concern the market in the short-term is overheated
after the Toraku’s high,” said  Juichi Wako , a senior strategist
at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc.  The euro declined against 12 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts after a downgrade to Ireland’s credit rating added
to concern Europe’s debt crisis may spread.  Ireland’s credit rating was cut three levels by Fitch
Ratings to the lowest of any of the major rating companies after
the country sought international assistance last month to rescue
its banks.  Exporters Drop  Toyota Motor , an automaker that earns about 70 percent of
its revenue abroad, sank 1.4 percent to 3,230 yen. Honda Motor
Co., a carmaker that gets about 80 percent of its sales abroad,
slumped 1.4 percent to 3,140 yen. The carmakers were the
heaviest drags on the Topix among its 1,664 companies, followed
by Komatsu.  Fanuc, a maker of industrial robots that earns almost 20
percent of its revenue in Europe and a further 40 percent from
Asia excluding Japan, lost 1.9 percent to 12,350 yen,
contributing the most to the drop of the Nikkei 225.  Sony Corp. ,
an electronics maker that earns about 40 percent of its revenue
from the U.S. and Europe, slipped 1.6 percent to 2,993 yen.  Makers of cars and electronics were the heaviest drags on
the Topix among its 33 industry groups, followed by machinery
makers and trading houses.  Yen Strengthens  The yen appreciated to as high as 110.59 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 111.55 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 83.52 from 83.83. A stronger yen reduces
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  Komatsu, the world’s second-largest maker of construction
and mining equipment, sank 2.2 percent to 2,427 yen. Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co., the world’s biggest maker of giant
excavators, fell 1.1 percent to 1,973 yen.  China’s consumer price index might have jumped 5.1 percent
in November from a year before, the most since July 2008 and
above economists’ median estimate of 4.7 percent, reports from
Citigroup Inc. and the Economic Information Daily indicated
today.  China will tighten interest rates while it will keep a
certain level of high growth, “or the country will encounter
social unrest,” Sumitomo Trust’s Sera said. “Unless China has
a sharp slowdown, Japanese stocks won’t plunge.”  Trading Houses  Mitsui declined 1.7 percent to 1,352 yen.  Mitsubishi Corp. ,
Japan’s biggest commodities trader, retreated 0.7 percent to
2,163 yen. Mitsubishi Materials Corp., Japan’s third-largest
copper producer, also tumbled 2.6 percent to 259 yen.  Copper prices for March delivery fell in New York yesterday
on speculation that China, the world’s biggest metal consumer,
will raise interest rates to slow economic growth and inflation.
The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including copper
and aluminum slid 0.8 percent yesterday, the first drop in four
days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
