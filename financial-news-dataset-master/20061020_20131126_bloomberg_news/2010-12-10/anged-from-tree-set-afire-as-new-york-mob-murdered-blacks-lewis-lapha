In 1799, New York passed a law
gradually emancipating slaves, but that did not erase hostility
toward African Americans. The nonstop arrival of white
immigrants displaced skilled black laborers, who were forced
into menial jobs, like “tubmen” or outhouse cleaners.  Anti-black feelings also led to violence. In July, 1863,
the Draft Riots broke out in New York. What started as a protest
against the rich who could buy their way out of serving as
soldiers in the Civil War, turned into a rampage against black
New Yorkers.  Many who fell into the hands of the mob were tortured and
killed, including one man who was beaten with clubs and paving
stones, before being hanged from a tree and set on fire. Even
the Colored Orphan Asylum on Fifth Avenue was torched. No one
knows the exact death toll, but some estimates put it as high as
2,000.  I spoke with  Gene Dattel , author of “ Cotton and Race in
the Making of America ,” on the following topics:  1. Cotton Is King  2. Freed Slaves Trapped  3. Northern Imperialism  4. Black Labor Serves Cotton  5. Civil Rights Protests  To listen to the podcast, click  here . To buy this book in North
