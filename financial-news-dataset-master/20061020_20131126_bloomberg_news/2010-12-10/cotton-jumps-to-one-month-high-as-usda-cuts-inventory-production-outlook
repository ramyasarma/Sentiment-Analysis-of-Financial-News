Cotton futures rose to a one-month
high after the U.S. government slashed its forecast for
inventories to the lowest in at least 14 years. Orange juice
dropped.  U.S. stockpiles for the year ending July 31 will total 1.9
million bales, the  lowest  since the projection in May 1996, when
Bloomberg data begins, Department of Agriculture statistics
showed today. That was down 14 percent from the November
estimate. Cotton prices have surged 81 percent this year,
heading for the biggest annual gain since 1973.  “We’ve got a bullish U.S. number because they cut stocks
to just incredibly low numbers,” said  Sharon Johnson , a senior
analyst at Penson Futures in Atlanta.  Cotton futures for March delivery rose 1.02 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $1.3697 a pound at 2:40 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price jumped by the
exchange limit of 5 cents to $1.4095, the highest since Nov. 11.  The U.S. crop will be 0.8 percent smaller than last month’s
estimate, the government said. Yields in the U.S., the world’s
biggest exporter, were lowered to 814 pounds an acre after hail
damaged crops in Texas. Last month’s estimate was 821 pounds.  Inventories  held in warehouses monitored by ICE have
plunged 73 percent this year.  Futures rose 3.5 percent this week, after surging 18
percent last week. The fiber reached a record $1.5195 on Nov. 10
on signs that growers would struggle to meet mounting demand
from China, the world’s biggest consumer.  “Overall, demand is still huge,” said  Tom Mikulski , a
senior market-strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “The trend
is still up.”  A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery slid 1.85 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to settle at $1.606 a pound in New York. Prices
gained 2.4 percent this week and are up 24 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
