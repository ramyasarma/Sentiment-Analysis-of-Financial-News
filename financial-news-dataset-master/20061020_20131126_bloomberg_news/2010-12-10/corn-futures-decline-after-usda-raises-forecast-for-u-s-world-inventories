Corn fell for a fourth time this
week after the government said U.S. stockpiles before next
year’s harvest will be larger than estimated.  On Aug. 31, U.S. inventories will total 832 million bushels
(21.1 million metric tons), up from 827 million forecast in
November, the Department of Agriculture  said . Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News expected 806 million, on average. Before
today, prices jumped 5.6 percent this month, partly on
speculation that the supply outlook would be reduced.  “The market was looking for a modest cut, and the USDA
gave it an increase,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  Corn futures for March delivery lost 6.25 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $5.68 a bushel at 10:24 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. A close at that price would leave the grain down 1
percent this week, snapping two weeks of gains.  World inventories will total 130 million tons, compared
with 129.16 million estimated in November, the USDA said.  In the season started Oct. 1, world production will be
820.71 million tons, up from last month’s forecast of 818.52
million, the USDA said. Last season, farmers harvested a record
812.4 million tons. Output will rise in the European Union,
Canada and Ukraine, the agency said.  The USDA also raised its forecast for global consumption of
lower-grade wheat in animal-feed rations, reducing demand for
higher cost U.S. corn, Schultz said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $47.4 billion in
2008, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
