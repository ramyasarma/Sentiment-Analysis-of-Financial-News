The last surviving flag from General
George Armstrong Custer’s last stand at the Battle of Little
Bighorn may fetch as much as $5 million when it is put up for
auction by Sotheby’s in New York today, the Associated Press
reported.  Custer and more than 200 of his troopers of the 7th Cavalry
were killed by warriors from the Lakota Sioux and Northern
Cheyenne tribes in june, 1876; only one of the unit’s flags,
known as guidons, was found, underneath the body of a dead
soldier, the agency said.  The flag fetched $54 when it was first sold in the 1890s,
AP said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
