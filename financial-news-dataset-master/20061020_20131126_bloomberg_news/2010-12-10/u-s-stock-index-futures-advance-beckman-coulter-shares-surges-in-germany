U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level since the week
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy in 2008, after
 General Electric Co.  boosted its dividend and reports on
consumer confidence and the trade deficit beat forecasts.  GE advanced 3.4 percent, the most in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, after raising its dividend for a second time
in sixth months.  Occidental Petroleum Corp.  rose 2.2 percent
after lifting its payout and announcing its biggest acquisition
since 2006.  Tenet Healthcare Corp.  soared 55 percent as
 Community Health Systems Inc.  made an unsolicited offer of $7.3
billion.  Beckman Coulter Inc.  surged 26 percent as people
familiar with the matter said it’s exploring a sale.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.6 percent to 1,240.40 at 4 p.m. in New
York, extending its weekly advance to 1.3 percent. The  Dow 
average added 40.26 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,410.32.  “We have moderately better economic growth,” said  Mike Ryan , the New York-based head of wealth management research for
the Americas at UBS Financial Services Inc., which oversees
about $641 billion. “As the economy is in better footing,
companies start engaging in strategic acquisitions, capital
spending and shareholder-friendly practices.”  The S&P 500 built on yesterday’s 0.4 percent advance, which
was driven by Pacific Investment Management Co., the world’s
largest bond fund manager, raising its forecast for economic
growth. The U.S. stock benchmark gauge is up 11 percent this
year on investor expectation that government measures will
bolster economic growth.  China Concern  Stocks advanced today even after China ordered lenders to
park more money with the central bank for the third time in five
weeks to counter the threat from inflation after November’s
lending and trade surplus topped analysts’ estimates. Reserve
requirements will increase 50 basis points starting Dec. 20, the
People’s Bank of China said on its website today.  Stocks extended gains as the trade deficit in the U.S.
shrank more than forecast in October as a weaker  dollar  and
growing economies overseas propelled  exports  to a two-year high.
The  gap  narrowed 13 percent to $38.7 billion, less than the
lowest estimate of 78 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and
the smallest since January, Commerce Department figures showed
in Washington. Exports were the strongest since August 2008.  “People who had been looking at the glass half empty might
be surprised,” said  Frank Ingarra , a Stamford, Connecticut-
based money manager at Hennessy Advisors Inc., which oversees
about $900 million. “The economy is picking up and exports are
a great indication of that as well.”  Consumer Confidence  Confidence among U.S. consumers increased more than
forecast in December to the highest level in six months at the
same time Americans began stepping up holiday spending. The
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of
consumer sentiment rose to 74.2 from 71.6 at the end of
November. Economists projected a December reading of 72.5,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  GE  led a gauge of industrial companies up 1 percent, the
biggest gain among the S&P 500’s 10 groups. The world’s biggest
maker of jet engines, power-generation equipment and locomotives
increased its quarterly dividend to 14 cents a share, exceeding
the 12-cent estimate from Bloomberg analysts. The stock rose 3.4
percent to $17.72.  Occidental added 2.2 percent to $93.04. The energy company
agreed to buy oil and gas properties in South Texas and North
Dakota for $3.2 billion. The company also said it’s boosting its
quarterly dividend to 46 cents a share from 38 cents.  Tenet, Beckman  Tenet soared 55 percent, the most since at least 1980, to
$6.65 for the biggest gain in the S&P 500. Community Health’s
bid of $6 a share, including $5 a share in cash and $1 per share
in its common stock, was rejected as “not remotely fair value”
by Dallas-based Tenet. The equity offer of $3.3 billion would
represent about a 40 percent premium over Tenet’s $4.29 closing
price yesterday.  Community Health jumped 13 percent to $35.89.  Beckman Coulter  rallied 26 percent to $72.08. The maker of
laboratory equipment for scientific research is exploring a sale
after it was approached by buyout firms interested in taking the
company private, people with knowledge of the matter said.  First Solar Inc.  led solar shares higher after Senate
negotiators approved extending grants to U.S. wind and solar
power companies for one year. Shares of the world’s largest
maker of thin-film solar modules advanced 3.7 percent to
$138.20. SunPower Corp. climbed 6.9 percent to $13.78.  National Semiconductor Corp.  slumped 7.8 percent to $13.81
for the biggest retreat in the S&P 500. The maker of analog
integrated circuits forecast third-quarter sales lower than
analysts predicted. Revenue this quarter will be $344 million to
$359 million, compared with $382.3 million, the average estimate
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  New York Times Co.  slipped 1.3 percent to $9.61 while
 Office Depot Inc.  declined 1.6 percent to $4.87 after they were
removed from the S&P 500. Among stocks added to the benchmark
index,  Cablevision Systems Corp.  rose 4.1 percent to $34.72 and
 Netflix Inc.  increased 1.9 percent to $194.63.  To contact the reporters on this story:
