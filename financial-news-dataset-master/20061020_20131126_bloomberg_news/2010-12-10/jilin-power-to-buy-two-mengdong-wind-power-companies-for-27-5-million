Jilin Power Share Co. will pay 183
million yuan ($27.5 million) to buy two wind power operators
from Mengdong Century Concord New Energy Co.  The two wind-energy companies each have 49.5-megawatt wind
farms in Jilin province with a power purchase price of 0.58 yuan
a kilowatt-hour, Jilin Power said today in a filing to
Shenzhen’s stock exchange.  Both companies will be wholly owned by Jilin Power once the
deal is completed, according to the filing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
