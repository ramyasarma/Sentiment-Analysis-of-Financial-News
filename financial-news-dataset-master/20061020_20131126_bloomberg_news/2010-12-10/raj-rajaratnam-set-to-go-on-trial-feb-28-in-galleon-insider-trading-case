Galleon Group LLC founder  Raj Rajaratnam  is scheduled to go on trial Feb. 28 on charges he
used tips from company executives, hedge-fund employees and
others in a multimillion dollar insider-trading scheme.  U.S. District Judge  Richard J. Holwell , in an order filed
today in federal court in Manhattan, said the charges against
Rajaratnam will be tried separately from those against his co-
defendant  Danielle Chiesi . The trial of Chiesi, a former hedge
fund consultant, is scheduled to start April 25.  Rajaratnam, 53, was arrested last year and is the central
figure in a probe of insider trading at hedge funds that has led
to 14 guilty pleas. He and Chiesi, a former consultant at New
Castle Funds LLC, deny wrongdoing. Theirs is the largest
insider-trading case involving hedge funds.  Rajaratnam and Chiesi last month lost a bid to block the
first-ever use of wiretap evidence in an insider-trading case.
Evidence at an October hearing showed that the government
secretly recorded about 2,400 conversations between Rajaratnam
and more than 130 friends, business associates and alleged
accomplices.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
