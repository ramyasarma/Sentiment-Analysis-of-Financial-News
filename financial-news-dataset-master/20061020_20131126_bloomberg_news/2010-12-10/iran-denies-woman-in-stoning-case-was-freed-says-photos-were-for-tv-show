Iran today denied it freed a woman
sentenced to death by stoning after photos were released
yesterday that showed her at home with her son during the making
of a program about her case by state-run Press TV.  “Some Western media outlets claimed Sakineh Mohammadi-
Ashtiani had been released from prison,” Press TV said today on
its English-language  website . The reports are part of a “vast
publicity campaign by Western media,” it said.  A team of Press TV journalists arranged with judicial
authorities to accompany Mohammadi-Ashtiani to her house “to
produce a visual recount of the crime at the murder scene,”
where her husband was killed, the broadcaster said. Her son and
lawyer were interviewed as part of the program, which is
scheduled to air in Iran starting this evening.  Mohammadi-Ashtiani was convicted in 2006 of adultery and
her husband’s murder. The sentence of stoning has drawn
international outrage. Iran has condemned the media attention
and the “politicization” of her case.  Mohammadi-Ashtiani’s son and lawyer were arrested in a raid
in the northwestern city of Tabriz on Oct. 10 along with two
Germans who are accused of trying to interview them to create
"negative propaganda."  To contact the reporter on this story:
