Detroit,  whose population has
dropped by half since 1950, borrowed $100 million to turn the
 MGM Grand Casino’s  former site into a headquarters for the
police, fire and emergency-services departments.  The city sold so-called Recovery Zone Bonds authorized
under the U.S. economic-stimulus plan, borrowing at 4.55
percent, the city said in a press release today. The bonds, with
the longest term maturing in 2035, were sold through the
Michigan Finance Authority by investment banks led by Siebert
Brandford Shank & Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The financial markets believe in what we’re doing to
bring fiscal responsibility back to Detroit,” said Mayor  Dave Bing,  in a prepared statement today.  So-called recovery zone bonds were included in the
economic-stimulus package signed by President Barack Obama last
year to help expand the economy of areas with poverty and
unemployment. They’re a type of Build America Bond that comes
with a 45 percent interest subsidy rather than 35 percent rate
under the Build America program, which expires Dec. 31.  The bonds were rated A1, or fifth highest, by Moody’s
Investor’s Service and AA-, or fourth highest, by Standard &
Poor’s.  Detroit’s population has declined by 50 percent to 910,000
since 1950, according to U.S. Census figures cited in the
official statement for the bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
