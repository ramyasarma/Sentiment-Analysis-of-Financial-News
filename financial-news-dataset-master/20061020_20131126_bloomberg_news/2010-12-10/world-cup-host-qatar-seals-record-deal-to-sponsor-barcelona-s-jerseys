Qatar, which won the rights to host
the 2022 World Cup, agreed to sponsor the jerseys of three-time
European soccer champion Barcelona until 2016.  The Spanish team said it will get 30 million euros ($39.8
million) a year to promote the Qatar Foundation, which bankrolls
education in the Persian Gulf state.  Qatar, which has the world’s third-largest gas reserves,
last week became the smallest nation to win the right to host
the World Cup. It’s tying itself to a club that provided half
Spain’s World Cup-winning team and all three shortlisted players
for the world player of the year award:  Lionel Messi ,  Andres Iniesta  and  Xavi Hernandez .  The accord is “an extraordinary landmark because it’s a
record amount” for a soccer team sponsorship, Barcelona said on
its website today.  Barcelona has for decades shunned paid-for advertising on
its jerseys, which carried the logo of the United Nations
Children’s Fund since 2006.  The Qatar Foundation was launched in 1995. Calls to its
spokesman Tariq Alsada went unanswered today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
