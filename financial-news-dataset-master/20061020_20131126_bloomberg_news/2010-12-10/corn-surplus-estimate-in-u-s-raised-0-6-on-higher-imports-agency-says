U.S. stockpiles of corn before next 
year’s harvest will be 0.6 percent larger than estimated last 
month because of a gain in imports, the government said.  The  surplus  on Aug. 31, the end of the marketing year, will
be 832 million bushels, up from 827 million forecast in November
and less than 1.708 billion on hand a year earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today in a  report . A rise in
imports to 15 million bushels from 10 million was the only
change the department made from the previous forecast. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News expected inventories of 806 million
bushels, on average.  Even with the increase, “corn supplies are getting snug,”
 Jerrod Kitt , a market analyst for the Linn Group Inc. in
Chicago, said before the report. “You will need near-perfect
global weather next year to rebuild inventories to more
comfortable levels.”  Corn futures for March delivery fell 0.25 cent to close at
$5.7425 a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn
has surged 50 percent in the past year as adverse weather
reduced global production.  Crop Estimate  The USDA’s crop estimate of 12.54 billion bushels is 4.4
percent smaller than 2009’s record output of 13.11 billion
bushels. The government on Jan. 12 will release its final
estimate of this year’s harvest and an estimate for consumption
for the first three months of the marketing year that began
Sept. 1.  The USDA estimated  world production  in the 2010-2011
season, which began Oct. 1, at 820.71 million metric tons, up
from 818.52 million forecast in November, on increased
production in the European Union, Canada and Ukraine. That
compares with a record 812.4 million tons harvested last season.  China Production  China , the second-largest producer, will harvest 168
million tons, unchanged from last month, the USDA said. Its
estimate for China’s imports and exports were also left
unchanged, at 200,000 tons and 1 million tons, respectively.  Global consumption will reach 837.91 million tons, up from
837.31 million estimated last month and more than‘ 812.5 million
last year, the USDA said. It would be the second straight year
world consumption exceeds output.  World inventories  before next year’s harvest will total 130
million tons, up from 129.16 million estimated in November and
down from 147.19 million this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
