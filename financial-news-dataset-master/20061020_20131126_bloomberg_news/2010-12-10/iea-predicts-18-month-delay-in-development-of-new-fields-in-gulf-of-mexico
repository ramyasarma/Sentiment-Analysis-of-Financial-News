The  International Energy Agency 
forecast the development of new oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico
will be delayed by 12 to 18 months, more than previously
estimated, because of restrictions after the  BP Plc  spill.  The agency earlier this year said new projects would likely
be delayed by six to 12 months after the U.S. imposed a
moratorium on deepwater drilling. The IEA today reiterated that
the Macondo field spill will curb Gulf output by 300,000 barrels
a day in 2015.  “With even permits for shallow-water drilling (not covered
by the moratorium) having been less than forthcoming in recent
months, coupled with new, tighter, regulations in place, and the
new regulator apparently struggling to cope with new demands
made on its time, delays to drilling are now seen to be
prolonged,” Paris-based IEA said today in its monthly report.  Drilling has languished for almost two months since
President  Barack Obama  lifted the moratorium imposed after the
Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20, killing 11 people
and unleashing the biggest U.S. oil spill. The Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement is drafting
guidance for offshore drilling and won’t “cut corners” when
approving permits, Director Michael Bromwich said Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
