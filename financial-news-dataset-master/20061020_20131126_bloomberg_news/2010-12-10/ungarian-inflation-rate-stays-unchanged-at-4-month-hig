Hungary’s  inflation  rate was
unchanged at a four-month high in November as rising food and
household energy prices prevented the index from dropping to the
central bank’s target rate.  The annual rate was 4.2 percent, the statistics office in
Budapest said today. The data matched the median estimate of 11
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Prices rose 0.3 percent from
October, the second consecutive monthly increase.  Hungary’s  central bank  unexpectedly raised its  benchmark
interest rate  in November after holding it at a record low for
six months and said further monetary tightening may be needed to
contain inflation and anchor expectations at policy makers’ 3
percent target rate.  The central bank last month raised its 2011 inflation
forecast to 4 percent from 3.5 percent and estimates the 2012
consumer-price index at an average 3.3 percent. Policy makers
want to avert inflation expectations from stabilizing at a
higher level, Magyar Nemzeti Bank President  Andras Simor  said on
Dec. 7.  Food prices advanced an annual 5.9 percent in November
while household energy prices, including electricity and gas,
rose 7.9 percent. Motor fuels rose 5.4 percent. The prices of
consumer durable goods declined 1.7 percent and clothing fell
0.7 percent. On the month, food prices rose 1.1 percent.  Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy
prices, was at an annual 1.9 percent in November, compared with
1.8 percent in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
