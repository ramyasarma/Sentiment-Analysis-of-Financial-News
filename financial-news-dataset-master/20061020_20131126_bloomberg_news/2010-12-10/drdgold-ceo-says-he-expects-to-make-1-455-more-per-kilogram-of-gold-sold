DRDGold Ltd. , a South African miner,
expects to get 10,000 rand ($1,450) more per kilogram of gold it
sells this quarter than the 288,000 rand it received in the
previous three months because of higher prices.  The “three months leading up to Christmas always seem to
be a good time for the gold bulls,” Chief Executive Officer
 Niel Pretorius  wrote in an e-mail to investors today.  Gold for immediate delivery rose to a record $1,431.25 an
ounce on Dec. 7. South African producers, seeking to maintain or
expand output, face rising costs as they dig deeper to reach
reserves. The nation has the deepest mines, extracting gold from
rock as far as 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) underground.  For every metric ton of gold produced, DRDGold’s sales may
grow 10 million rand in the quarter, Pretorius said, adding the
company would achieve “similar” levels of output as the three
months through September, when it produced 2,030 kilograms
(4,475 pounds).  Higher prices and an absence of winter tariffs “are both
likely to have a very attractive impact on the cost and revenue
line,” he said. Eskom Holdings Ltd., the state-run electricity
utility, charges higher power rates in winter.  DRDGold was little changed at 3.43 rand at the 5 p.m. close
in Johannesburg, valuing the company at 1.3 billion rand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
