YPF SA  is seeking to sell as much as
$600 million of bonds this month at 6 percent, the lowest rate
for an Argentine company this year and about half the yield on
the country’s provincial debt.  The company, a unit of Madrid-based Repsol YPF SA, is
trying to cut the yield it pays on the international bonds after
receiving offers from investors willing to accept 6.5 percent,
said a company official who asked not to be identified because
the talks are private. The debt would have a maturity of six to
eight years, another official said.  YPF’s bonds would yield at least 500 basis points, or 5
percentage points, less than those sold by Buenos Aires province
and lender Banco Supervielle SA this year. YPF’s sale comes
after the yield on federal government bonds due in 2017 sank 396
basis points since June to 8.3 percent, while the average yield
for Latin American energy companies in Credit Suisse Group AG’s
 Labi index  fell 83 basis points to 6.81 percent yesterday.  “If I’m going to take Argentina exposure, I’d rather own
the provincial debt at 11 percent,”  Eric Ollom , chief emerging-
markets strategist at Jefferies & Co. in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “If I’m a dedicated emerging-markets
person, with a limited amount of Argentina allocation, I’m not
buying YPF because it’s going to underperform. I’m not going to
own a YPF several hundred basis points through the sovereign.”  Repsol’s 2017 bonds denominated in euros yield 4.43
percent. The 2018 dollar bonds from Petrobras, Latin America’s
largest oil company by market value, yield 4.77 percent.  Provincial Bonds  Buenos Aires province, Argentina’s largest by population,
sold $550 million of five-year bonds to yield 12 percent in
September and another $250 million of the notes to yield 11.75
percent the next month; the yield was 11.23 percent yesterday.  Banco Supervielle bonds due in 2017 yielded 11.5 yesterday
after being sold at 11.62 percent.  Moody’s Investors Service rates YPF’s long-term debt Ba1,
one step below investment grade. Supervielle’s rating is Caa1,
seven steps below investment grade. Buenos Aires province is
rated B3, one step higher than Supervielle.  Argentine companies are selling the most bonds in global
markets since 2007. Candy maker Arcor SAIC, rated two steps
below investment grade by Moody’s, sold $200 million of seven-
year notes at 7.25 percent on Nov. 4, while Pan American Energy
LLC, Argentina’s second-largest crude producer, sold $500
million worth of bonds April 30 at 8.125 percent.  Arcor’s bonds yielded 6.32 percent yesterday, while bonds
from Pan American, which is rated Ba1 by Moody’s, were priced at
6.95 percent.  Bond Spreads  “The spreads of Arcor and others compressed after the bond
sale and have reached close to 6 percent,”  Juan Pablo Vera , a
Buenos Aires-based bond analyst with brokerage Tavelli y
Asociados, said in a phone interview yesterday. “It is a low
yield, but the excess of liquidity makes this possible.”  A YPF official, who can’t be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak publicly for the company, declined to
comment on the bond sale plans.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 7 basis points today to
500 as of 9:28 a.m. New York time, the highest among major
emerging markets after Venezuela and Ecuador, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Default Swaps  The cost of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment
for five years with credit-default swaps fell 1 basis points to
636 yesterday, according to data compiled by CMA. Credit-default
swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying
securities or the cash equivalent should a government or company
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  Warrants linked to Argentina’s economic growth rose 0.06
cent to 13.98 cents today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The peso fell 0.1 percent to 3.9764 per dollar.  YPF on Dec. 7 said that it replaced 100 percent of its
crude reserves for the first time in 12 years and also announced
its biggest gas discovery in at least 35 years, which would help
it stem declining output from maturing fields.  The company is operated by Argentina’s Eskenazi family,
which  owns  15.4 percent of the company. Repsol, which owns 83.21
percent, announced this month it plans to sell as much as 15
percent through share offerings in New York and Buenos Aires.
Repsol acquired YPF in 1999.  The Eskenazi family, who bought their stake in 2007, has an
option to acquire an additional 10 percent by 2012. YPF Chief
Executive Officer  Sebastian Eskenazi  said in May the group wants
to make use of the option before the end of this year.  “Lower yields are absolutely fueled by the local political
climate and YPF’s management has affinity with the government,”
Tavelli’s Vera said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
