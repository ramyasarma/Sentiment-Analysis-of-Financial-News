Rolls-Royce Plc faces costs and
penalties of more than the 50 million pounds ($80 million) to
fix its Trent 900 engine that blew up on an Airbus SAS A380
operated by Qantas Airways Ltd., according to  Nick Cunningham  of
Agency Partners.  Compensation will extend to Qantas, which grounded all six
of its A380s for 23 days and now is operating only two, and to
other client airlines and the plane manufacturer Airbus, for
expected delays in future deliveries, he said.  Rolls may also find it more challenging to market the
engine to potential customers, Cunningham said. That would
provide an advantage to  General Electric Co.  and United
Technologies Corp.’s Pratt & Whitney, which together make a
rival powerplant for the A380.  “This event and its aftermath might impact on the
marketability of the Trent 900 engine,” according to
Cunningham, who is a managing partner at the London-based
investment advisory firm and a 25-year veteran of the industry.
“This could have a cost in terms of market share and pricing.”  The costs to 2010 profit are unlikely to be the final
installment, Cunningham said. Further charges against 2011
accounts will probably follow, he said.  Rolls fell 1.5 percent to 632.5 pence in London trading as
of 8:04 a.m.  To contact the reporters on this story:
