England named Chris Woakes, Craig
Kieswetter, Luke Wright, Michael Yardy and James Tredwell to the
Twenty20 cricket squad that will take on Australia starting Jan.
12.  The team will be led by Paul Collingwood for the two-match
series, England said today in an e-mailed statement. Woakes
hasn’t played for the team previously, and will get a chance to
replace Stuart Broad, who left Australia after tearing a stomach
muscle.  Andrew Strauss will be captain of England’s One-Day
International squad in the seven-match series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
