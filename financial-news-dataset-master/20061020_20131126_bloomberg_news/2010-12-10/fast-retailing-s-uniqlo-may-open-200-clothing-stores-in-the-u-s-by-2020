Fast Retailing Co. , Asia’s biggest
clothing chain, aims to open at least 200  Uniqlo  stores in the
U.S. by 2020 as it seeks to raise sales sixfold in a decade.  “The United States is one of the most important markets
for us,” Shin Odake, chief executive officer of Uniqlo’s U.S.
unit, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in New York
aired yesterday. “We want to become the number one retailer in
the world.”  Fast Retailing , which plans to open its second U.S. store
on New York’s Fifth Avenue next year, aims for revenue to reach
5 trillion yen ($60 billion) by 2020. The Yamaguchi City, Japan-
based company is considering opening stores in other major
cities including San Francisco, Chicago and Boston, Odake said.  The company will hire 50 U.S. college graduates this year
and send them to Japan for six months to train them to be
managers, Odake said.  Fast Retailing  rose  0.4 percent to 13,060 yen as of 12:54
p.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 25
percent this year.  Fast Retailing  will add 44 Uniqlo stores overseas and 36 in
Japan in the 12 months to August, bringing the total to 1,024,
the company said Oct. 8. That’s the same pace of openings as its
last fiscal year. The company has said it aims to boost the
tally to 4,000 by 2020.  Uniqlo’s sole U.S. store is located in New York’s Soho
district. Fast Retailing also sells the Theory apparel brand in
the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
