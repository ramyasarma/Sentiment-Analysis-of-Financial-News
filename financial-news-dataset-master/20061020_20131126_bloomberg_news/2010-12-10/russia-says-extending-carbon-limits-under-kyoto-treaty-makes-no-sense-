Russia said the Kyoto Protocol
limiting greenhouse gas emissions shouldn’t be extended and
countries instead should focus on forging a new treaty to fight
climate change.  “From our point of view there’s not any sense to just
continue because only a few limited countries have
obligations,” Alexander Frolov, deputy head of the Russian
delegation, said today in an interview in Cancun, Mexico, where
193 countries are gathered for United Nations climate treaty
negotiations.  Envoys should focus on creating “building blocks for a new
universal agreement” that includes all major polluters such as
the U.S. and China, Frolov said.  The comment indicates divisions remain between industrial
and developing nations about how to cut fossil fuel emissions as
two weeks of UN-sponsored climate talks enter their final day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
