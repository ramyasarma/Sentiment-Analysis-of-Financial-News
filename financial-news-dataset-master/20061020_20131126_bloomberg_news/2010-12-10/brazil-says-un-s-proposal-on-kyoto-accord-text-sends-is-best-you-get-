Brazilian Environment Minister
Izabella Teixeira said the proposed United Nation agreement on
limiting greenhouse gases demonstrates is “the best you get”
and sends a signal that “clear political will” remains to
extend restrictions  The comments, in an interview at the UN climate talks in
Cancun, Mexico, suggest envoys may be able to reach an agreement
on the future of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Brazil and the U.K.
were tapped by the UN to defuse a dispute over the issue.  She said “a clear political will to continue the technical
discussions about a second commitment period. We are optimistic.
We did all the political arrangements.”  The proposal aims to bridge divisions between Japan, Russia
and Canada, which have refused to take on new restrictions on
fossil fuel emissions after current ones in the Kyoto Protocol
expire in 2012, and China, India, Brazil and South Africa which
have pressed for new requirements.  “We developing countries want more,” Teixeira said in an
interview. “This is the Brazilian position. But we worked hard
to have this perspective, the political perspective, to move
forward in the negotiations for the second commitment period.
This is the best that you get.”  The accord aims to “avoid a gap between the first and the
second periods and to establish the political guidelines for the
negotiations next year,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
