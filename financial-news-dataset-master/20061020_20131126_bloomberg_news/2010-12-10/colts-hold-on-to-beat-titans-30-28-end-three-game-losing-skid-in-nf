The Indianapolis Colts survived a
fourth-quarter surge by the Tennessee Titans to snap a three-
game losing skid in the National Football League.  Adam Vinatieri  kicked two field goals in the fourth quarter
to counter two touchdowns by Tennessee’s  Bo Scaife  as the Colts
held out for a 30-28 win. Colts quarterback  Peyton Manning 
passed for two touchdowns and no interceptions after throwing a
career-record 11 interceptions in his past three games.  The win lifts the Colts to 7-6, a half-game behind the
Jacksonville Jaguars, who lead the four-team American Football
Conference South Division with a 7-5 record. Indianapolis hosts
Jacksonville on Dec. 19.  “Hopefully we can sort of build off this win,” Manning told
reporters. “This was a playoff game.”  Two touchdown passes from Manning to  Pierre Garcon  in the
second quarter along with a 1-yard scoring run by Javarris James
took the Colts to a 21-7 halftime lead at LP Field in Nashville.  Craig Stevens  scored for the home team on a 7-yard pass
from quarterback  Kerry Collins  in the third quarter and
Vinatieri kicked a 21-yard field goal to make it 24-14 to
Indianapolis at the start of the fourth quarter.  Vinatieri extended his team’s advantage to 13 points with a
28-yard field goal before Scaife scored on a 4-yard pass from
Collins. Vinatieri then added three more points from 47 yards
before Scaife completed the scoring as time expired on a 2-yard
pass from Collins.  Manning completed 25 of 35 passes for 319 yards. It was his
63rd career 300-yard game, tying him with  Dan Marino .  “This was a good overall team win,” Manning said in a
televised interview. “Close game, the kind of game we
expected.”  Collins completed 28 of 39 passes for 244 yards for the
Titans (5-8).  To contact the reporter on this story:
