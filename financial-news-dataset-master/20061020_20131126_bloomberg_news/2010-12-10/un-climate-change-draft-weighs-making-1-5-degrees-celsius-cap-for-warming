The United Nations published a draft
climate agreement to cap two weeks of talks in Cancun, Mexico,
that includes actions by richer and poorer countries to cut
greenhouse gas emissions and sets the aim of containing warming
to 2 degrees Celsius.  The deal “takes note” of efforts to limit emissions taken
by developed and developing countries, including the largest
emitters, China and the U.S., and says nations will devise
guidelines to measure and report them in transparently,
responding to a key U.S. demand.  It also says that countries will consider strengthening the
temperature goal to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which island nations
have said is necessary to ensure their survival.  To contact the reporter on this story:
