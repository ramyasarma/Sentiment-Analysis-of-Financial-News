Brookfield Properties Corp . sold an
eight-story Washington office building for $216 million as
values increase in desirable investment markets.  The property, at 1225 Connecticut Ave. NW, was acquired by
the World Bank, which has occupied all 240,000 square feet
(23,000 square meters) of the building since 2008, when a $32
million renovation was completed, New York-based Brookfield said
today in a statement.  “In keeping with our capital recycling strategy, we will
be proactive in seeking similar opportunities to create value
within the D.C. market,”  Dennis Friedrich , chief executive
officer of Brookfield’s U.S. commercial operations, said in the
statement. The company has owned the building, once part of
Trizec Properties Inc.’s portfolio, since 2006.  Demand  for the best buildings in major markets pushed up
the Moody’s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index 0.3 percent in
September from a year earlier and 4.3 percent from August. U.S.
property deals probably will double next year and may account
for almost a quarter of global transactions, according to New
York-based research company Real Capital Analytics Inc.  New York and Washington are the strongest U.S. investment
markets,  Kenneth Rosen , chairman of Berkeley, California-based
Rosen Real Estate Securities LLC, said at a Nov. 22 conference.
The overall U.S. office market may be slowed as firms try to
lease unoccupied space known as “shadow inventory,” about 3
percent to 5 percent of total business leases, he said.  Brookfield announced the building sale after the close of
regular U.S. trading. The company’s shares rose 26 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $17.01 today in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have gained 40 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
