The U.S. Senate bill to extend Bush-
era tax cuts would add $801.3 billion to the federal deficit
over 10 years, legislative tax analysts said.  The proposal, an agreement between President Barack Obama
and congressional Republicans, would extend Bush-era tax cuts
for all levels of income. A two-year extension of those rates
would cost $407.6 billion, according to the Joint Committee on
Taxation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
