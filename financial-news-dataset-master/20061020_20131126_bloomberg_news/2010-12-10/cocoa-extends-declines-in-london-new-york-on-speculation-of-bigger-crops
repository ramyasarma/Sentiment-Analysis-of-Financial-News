Cocoa tumbled the most in 20 months
in London on speculation that the disputed presidential election
in Ivory Coast, the world’s largest grower, will have little
effect on output. Sugar advanced in New York.  Cocoa production in Africa will climb 6.7 percent to almost
2.6 million metric tons in the year that started Oct. 1, ABN
Amro Bank NV and VM Group said today in a report. The United
Nations-backed Ivory Coast government under Alassane Ouattara
asked civil servants and the military to stop working with
Laurent Gbagbo, who claimed victory from the Nov. 28 vote.  “The political situation in the Ivory Coast had the
potential to trigger some short-term supply issues, but the
reality is crops in western Africa are excellent,” said
 Emmanuel Jayet , the head of agriculture commodities at Societe
Generale SA in London.  On NYSE Liffe in London, cocoa futures for March delivery
declined 93 pounds, or 4.7 percent, to close at 1,899 pounds
($3,001) a metric ton at 4:46 p.m. local time, the biggest drop
since April 6, 2009.  In New York, cocoa for March delivery slumped $123, or 4.1
percent, to settle at $2,887 a ton on ICE Futures U.S., the
biggest drop since July 19. The price, down 1.6 percent this
week, has dropped 12 percent in 2010.  Growers have delivered about 350,000 tons to Ivory Coast
ports this season, “slightly” lower than a year earlier,  Alex Parry , a senior coffee and cocoa broker at ABN Amro, said in the
report.  “This slowing down does not signify a poorer crop, but
simply a reluctance to be on the country’s roads during a period
of possible disturbance,” he said. “If the situation calms,
then we expect arrivals to pick up and exceed last year.”  ‘Uncertainty Discounted’  “The political uncertainty has been discounted for,” said
 Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision Financial Markets in
Chicago.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery gained 0.42 cent, or
1.5 percent, to settle at 29.13 cents a pound in New York. In
London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery dropped $4.70,
or 0.6 percent, to $722.50 a ton.  Demand will exceed supplies in the year that ends Sept. 30,
ABN Amro Bank NV and VM Group said today, reversing an October
forecast for a surplus of 1.2 million tons.  Consumption will reach 165.3 million tons, almost 3 million
more than supplies, according to the report. The biggest deficit
will be in Asia, with a shortfall of 13.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
