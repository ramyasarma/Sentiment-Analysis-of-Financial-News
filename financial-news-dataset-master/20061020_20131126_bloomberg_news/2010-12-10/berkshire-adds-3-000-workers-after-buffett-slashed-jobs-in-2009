Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  added about
3,000 jobs this year as Chief Executive Officer  Warren Buffett 
invested in the firm’s biggest employer, railroad Burlington
Northern Santa Fe, after slashing the workforce in 2009.  Berkshire has 260,000 employees across more than 70
subsidiaries spanning insurance, energy, freight hauling and
luxury travel, according to a regulatory filing yesterday from
the Omaha, Nebraska-based company. That’s up from the  257,100
workers  at Berkshire and Burlington Northern at the end of 2009,
when the railroad was an independent company.  Buffett, 80, bought Burlington Northern in February in what
he called a bet on a U.S. economy emerging from the biggest
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Berkshire cut more
than 20,000 jobs last year as results at its manufacturing and
housing businesses suffered. The economy expanded 2.5 percent in
the third quarter after growing 1.7 percent in the second.
Unemployment remains near a 26-year high.  “With the weak economy I guess it’s relatively good that
employment went up 1 percent,” said  David Kass , a professor at
the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business.
“That would indicate stability in the Berkshire Hathaway
companies.”  Berkshire’s  Class A shares  declined $25 to $120,750 in
regular trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. The
shares have climbed about 22 percent this year, compared with
the 11 percent gain for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index .  Adding Workers  Buffett told shareholders in May that Berkshire
subsidiaries were adding jobs and that businesses serving broad
industries, like railroads, were leading the advance. Fort
Worth, Texas-based Burlington Northern, the second-biggest U.S.
railroad behind  Union Pacific Corp. , had 35,000 employees at the
end of 2009, down from 40,000 a year earlier.  The U.S. unemployment rate rose to a seven-month high of
9.8 percent in November as payroll growth slowed, the Labor
Department said last week. Hours worked and earnings stalled,
while a record 6.4 million women in the labor force were without
work last month. Joblessness stood at a 26-year high of  10.1
percent  in October 2009.  “We’re inching forward, we’re not galloping forward,”
Buffett said in remarks recorded for an October conference
outside Tel Aviv. “The worst is behind us, but the pain will be
felt for a long time from what happened.”  Burlington Northern, headed by CEO  Matthew Rose ,
contributed $706 million to Berkshire’s earnings in the third
quarter, compared with the $488 million of net income it posted
a year earlier as an independent company. The railroad planned
to invest more than $2.5 billion in capital and equipment this
year, Buffett said in September at the Montana Economic
Development Summit.  Berkshire’s apparel maker Fruit of the Loom had about
27,000 workers and carpet maker Shaw Industries employed 25,500,
according to the 2009 annual report from Buffett’s firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
