Spanish police uncovered a doping
ring in track and field involving athletes, doctors and coaches,
Secretary of State for Sports  Jaime Lissavetzky  said.  Police said late yesterday they arrested 14 people and
seized blood transfusion bags and drugs in  “Operation
Greyhound.”  World steeplechase champion  Marta Dominguez  was
released late yesterday after questioning in her hometown of
Palencia, Television Espanola reported.  Spain is seeking to dispel criticism from Aigle,
Switzerland-based cycling ruling body Union Cycliste
Internationale that it doesn’t do enough to counter doping.  “We don’t hide anything, we act in a correct manner,”
Lissavetzky told CNN+. “There was a doping ring.”  Tour de France winner  Alberto Contador  is among several
Spanish cyclists being investigated after positive doping tests.
A four-person panel at the Spanish cycling federation is
examining his case. Contador denies wrongdoing, saying he had
irregular test results because he ate contaminated beef.  To contact the reporter on this story:
