Mimi, Rodolfo and their band of
boastful poets, proud losers and eternal ravers crowd onto the
stage of La Monnaie/De Munt tonight for a year-end run.  Puccini’s “La Boheme,” a bittersweet romance full of airs
evoking youthful insouciance and crushed hopes, is staged by
Andreas Homoki, director of Berlin’s  Komische Oper , with Carlo
Rizzi in the pit. Ermonela Jaho plays delicate Mimi and Giuseppe
Filianoti is ardent Rodolfo.  “La Boheme,” sponsored by Swift, is at 8 p.m., La
Monnaie/De Munt, Place de la Monnaie/Muntplein, through Dec. 31.
Information:  http://www.lamonnaie.be  or 32-(0)70-23-3939.  Roue d’Or, a Belle Epoque brasserie off the holiday-
festooned Grand’ Place, is perfect for a late supper to discuss
the performance. It has Belgian winter dishes like mussels in a
white wine and cream sauce. Roue d’Or, 26, Rue des
Chapeliers/Hoedenmakersstraat, tel. +322-514-2554.  Saturday  The Villa Empain, an Art Deco mansion by architect Michel
Polak, has been restored by the Boghossian Foundation, run by
Lebanese-Armenian jewelers. Its new show, “Colors of the
Orient: Arts and Lifestyles in the Ottoman Empire” (through
Feb. 27) has some 300 items, ranging from exquisite 16th-century
porcelain to ornate swords, jewelry and textiles.  Villa Empain, 67, Avenue Franklin Rooseveltlaan.

restaurant set in a clearing of the nearby forest. The trademark
Wood Burger is a towering, multilayered concoction. You can
choose from an array of exotic cocktails in the glass-enclosed
bar. Wood, 3-4, Avenue de Florelaan. Information:
 http://www.thewood.be  or +322-640-1968.  Saturday Night  Eleanor Bauer is proud to be big. The latest solo
choreography by the dancer/singer/actor, who also performs with
Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker’s superb  Rosas  troupe, is titled
“Big Girls Do Big Things” and evokes polar bears,  Patsy Cline 
and black swans.  Kaaistudios, 81 Rue Notre-Dame du Sommeil/Onze-Lieve-Vrouw
van Vaakstraat, 8:30 p.m. Information:  http://www.kaaitheater.be 
or +322-201-5959.  Sunday  Gilbert & George decry racism, homophobia and nationalism,
among other headline topics, in “Jack Freak Pictures.” The
exhibition of 85 images from the dandy duo’s latest series of
computer-tweaked pictures is a loud screed of wry social
comment. Jack refers to the Union Jack, a twisted motif in most
of the works.  “Jack Freak Pictures” is at Bozar, 23, Rue
Ravensteinstraat, through Jan. 23, 2011. Information:
 http://www.bozar.be  or +322-507-82-00.  Laurent Gerbaud, a star of the new generation of Belgian
chocolate makers, has opened a shop across the street. Try the
kumquat special or warm up with a chic cup of hot chocolate.  Laurent Gerbaud, 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat. Information:

Taraf de Haidouks. The Romanian village group whips up feverish
dance music with fiddles, accordions and bells. They’ll be
joined by  Kocani Orkestar , a Macedonian brass band, at a
downtown music hall, which has its own cafe/restaurant around
the corner. Tomatoes stuffed with shrimp and served with fries
are a local favorite.  Ancienne Belgique, 110 Boulevard Anspachlaan, 8 p.m.
