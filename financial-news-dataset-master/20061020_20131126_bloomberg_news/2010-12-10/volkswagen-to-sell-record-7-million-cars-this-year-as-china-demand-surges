Volkswagen AG , Europe’s largest
carmaker, said annual deliveries in 2010 will exceed 7 million
for the first time as sales in China surge.  VW’s 11-month deliveries in the world’s largest car market
advanced 38 percent to 1.82 million vehicles, accounting for 28
percent of global sales, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company
said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  is counting on
China, VW’s largest market, to surpass  Toyota Motor Corp.  as the
world’s biggest carmaker by 2018. Passenger-car deliveries in
China surged 29 percent in November to a record 1.34 million,
the China Automobile Industry Association said yesterday.  “Overall prospects for China continue to look good,” said
 Aleksej Wunrau , an analyst at BHF-Bank AG in Frankfurt who has
an “overweight” rating on the stock and forecasts an industry-
wide sales gain of 12 percent in China next year. “VW will
again be in for double-digit growth.”  Volkswagen’s preferred  shares  increased as much as 4.20
euros, or 3.4 percent, to 128.40 euros and traded up 2.3 percent
as of 1:32 p.m. in Frankfurt. The stock has gained 95 percent
this year, valuing the German carmaker at 55.2 billion euros
($73.2 billion).  Volkswagen ’s nine-month operating profit in China more than
doubled to 1.32 billion euros. VW, the first overseas carmaker
to enter China three decades ago, will spend 10.6 billion euros
in the country through 2015 as part of an expansion to add two
factories and double production to 3 million cars annually. VW
currently has nine Chinese factories.  Audi Advances  Audi, the luxury leader in China, increased sales through
November in the country 50 percent to 139,900 vehicles on demand
for an extended version on the A6 sedan. Czech unit Skoda posted
56 percent Chinese growth to 167,000 cars.  Deliveries worldwide at VW group brands increased to
617,000 vehicles in November, VW said today. Eleven-month sales
advanced 13 percent to 6.59 million.  “Volkswagen is benefiting disproportionally from the
upturn in most major automobile markets,” VW sales chief
 Christian Klingler  said in the statement. “We will be well
above last year’s level and anticipate annual deliveries of more
than 7 million vehicles for the first time.”  Stimulus measures in China including a consumption-tax
rebate for smaller vehicles, subsidies for rural car-buyers and
incentives to trade in older models are due to expire at the end
of the December. China’s auto-industry lobby said yesterday the
incentives will likely expire as planned this year.  VW hasn’t greatly benefited from the program because the
German manufacturer’s larger models don’t qualify for tax
rebates, which are focused on smaller cars, Wunrau said.  “I can’t see how this policy is going to hurt VW greatly,
they’ve only drawn marginal benefits from those measures,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
