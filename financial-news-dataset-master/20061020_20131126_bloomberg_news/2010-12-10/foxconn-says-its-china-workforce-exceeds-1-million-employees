Foxconn Technology Group, the
world’s largest contract maker of electronics, said its Chinese
workforce now exceeds 1 million employees as the company
continues to hire during the holiday season.  “We’re still hiring as we speak,”  Louis Woo , special
assistant to the chief executive officer, said in a phone
interview in Shenzhen today. “Because of the Christmas holiday,
everybody is working very hard.”  Customer demand is spurring hiring, said Woo, who is
responsible for supervising employee welfare at the maker of
 Apple Inc . iPads and  Hewlett-Packard Co . computers. China’s
exports rose to a record last month, helped by stronger U.S. and
European demand, while retail sales grew 19 percent to 1.4
trillion yuan ($210 billion) in October from a year earlier, the
Chinese government said.  Foxconn, the largest private employer in China, plans to
expand its workforce to as many as 1.3 million by the end of
next year, Woo said in an August interview. The Taipei-based
company employed about 920,000 workers at that time.  After a spate of suicides in the first five months of this
year at its Shenzhen factories, Foxconn’s  management  increased
monthly wages for factory workers about 30 percent to 1,200 yuan
and promised a second raise in October to 2000 yuan.  Woo said 85 percent of front-line assembly workers hired
before March 31 qualified for the October increase. He didn’t
disclose the actual number.  To contact the reporter on this story:
