South African bonds rose for a
second day, reducing yields to a three-day low, on speculation
foreign investors were continuing to purchase the securities to
benefit from their yield advantage over developed nation assets.  The benchmark 13.5 percent government bond due September
2015 climbed 30 cents to 124.14 rand by 5:44 p.m. in
Johannesburg, reducing the yield by 7 basis points to 7.38
percent, the lowest level since Dec. 7. The move pared the
bond’s weekly decline to 28 cents, lifting the yield 4 basis
points in the week.  “The search for attractive yields remains the key driver
of global bond markets,” analysts at Tradition Analytic led by
 Quinten Bertenshaw  in Johannesburg, wrote in a client note
today. “These inflows remain a structural driver of the
domestic bond market. One should not underestimate the value to
be found at current levels,” in South Africa’s bond market, he
said.  Benchmark bond yields rose to as high as 7.52 percent this
week following a three-day sell-off as investors dumped the
securities on concern Europe’s debt crisis may spread. The
yields compare with rates of 3.21 percent available on  10-year 
Treasuries.  Foreign investors have been net purchasers of 66 billion
rand ($9.6 billion) of South African bonds this year as near-
zero interest rates in developed nations encouraged purchases of
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets. South Africa’s
 benchmark interest  rate of 5.5 percent compares with deposit
returns of 0.1 percent in Japan and 0.25 percent in the U.S.  The rand strengthened for a second day, appreciating 0.3
percent to 6.8550 per dollar, from a previous close of 6.8774,
leaving the currency up 0.4 percent in the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
