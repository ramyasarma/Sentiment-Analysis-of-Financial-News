Senwes Ltd., the company that
controls more than a quarter of South Africa’s grain-storage
facilities, said fiscal first-half profit dropped.  Net income declined to 90 million rand ($13.1 million) in
the six months through October from 147 million rand a year
earlier, the Klerksdorp, South Africa-based company said in a
statement published in the Business Day newspaper today. Revenue
slid to 4.12 billion rand from 4.69 billion rand.  The company said increasingly difficult agricultural
conditions will create opportunities for consolidation and
mergers. Its grain division will have a better second half
because of high volumes, better than expected offtake premiums
and improved stock management, Senwes said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
