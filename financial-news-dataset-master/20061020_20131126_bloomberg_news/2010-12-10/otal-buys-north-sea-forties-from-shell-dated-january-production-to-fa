Total SA bought a cargo of North Sea
Forties crude from Royal Dutch Shell. Production of the four
grades that make up Dated Brent will drop 8 percent next month.  Total said it bought a Dec. 22 to Dec. 24 shipment at $1
below the cash cost of North Sea oil in February. Occidental
Petroleum Corp.’s Phibro unit bid for a consignment without
attracting any sellers, according to traders involved in the
transactions.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts’ trading window that ends daily at 4:30 p.m. in
London. Prior to the window,  Forties  crude loading from 10 to 21
days in the future cost 30 cents less than Dated Brent,
unchanged from the previous day.  Brent crude for January settlement traded at $90.30 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the
close of the window, down from $90.67 a barrel at the same time
yesterday. The February contract traded at $90.44 a barrel. The
price spread between the two nearest-term contracts narrowed to
14 cents from 16 cents yesterday.  Shipments of the four North Sea grades that compose Dated
Brent will decline by 8 percent in January, according to loading
programs released today. Exports will total 1.11 million barrels
a day, down from 1.21 million a day this month.  Brent exports will total 4.2 million barrels in January, or
135,484 a day. Forties shipments will be 15 million barrels, or
483,871 a day. There will be 4.2 million barrels, or 135,484 a
day of Oseberg, and about 11.15 million barrels, or 359,677 a
day of Ekofisk.  Daily exports of North Sea Statfjord crude are scheduled to
decline 14 percent to 165,484 barrels a day in January,
according to its loading program. Gullfaks shipments will fall
12.2 percent to 193,548 barrels.  PT Pertamina, Indonesia’s state-owned oil company, is
seeking to buy low-sulfur crude oil for delivery in February,
according to a document obtained by Bloomberg News.  The company also purchased one cargo a month of Nigeria’s
Qua Iboe crude for delivery from February to April at its
Cilicap refinery, said an official who asked to remain
unidentified, citing company policy.  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest refiner, issued a
tender to buy crude oil for loading in February, according to
