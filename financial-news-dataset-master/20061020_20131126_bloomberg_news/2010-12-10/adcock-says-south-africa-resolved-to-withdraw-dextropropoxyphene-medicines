Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd. said
that while South Africa’s Medicines Control Council has resolved
to withdraw medicines containing dextropropoxyphene, it hasn’t
received a formal communication from the council.  The drugmaker has three products containing
dextropropoxyphene, which had combined sales of 200 million rand
in fiscal 2010, Adcock said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
