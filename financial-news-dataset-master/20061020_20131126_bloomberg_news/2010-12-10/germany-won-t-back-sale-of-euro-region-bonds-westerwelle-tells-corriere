Germany is pro euro “head to toe”
and won’t relinquish sovereignty over its debt management to
support the sale of euro-region bonds, Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said in an interview with Italy’s Corriere della
Sera.  The possibility of euro-region countries pooling their
national debt to collectively share risk is “unacceptable,”
Westerwelle told the newspaper. Such a plan wouldn’t give more
profligate countries “an incentive to maintain discipline” if
they knew that others were guaranteeing their borrowing, he was
cited as saying.  Germany’s policy is designed to make the euro stronger and
anyone who wants to do away with the euro “cannot succeed,”
said Westerwelle, who leads the Free Democratic Party,
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s junior coalition partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
