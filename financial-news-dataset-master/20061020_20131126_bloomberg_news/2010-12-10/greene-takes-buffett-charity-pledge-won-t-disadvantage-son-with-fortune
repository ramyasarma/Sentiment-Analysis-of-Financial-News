Billionaire real-estate investor
 Jeff Greene  has committed most of his wealth to charity, saying
he doesn’t want to harm his son with too large an inheritance.  “I’ve had the opportunity to meet and get to know a number
of people who were what I would say ‘cursed’ with very large
inheritances,” Greene said in a letter  posted  on the website of
the Giving Pledge, the philanthropy initiative led by  Warren Buffett . “These folks had the disadvantage of the advantaged.”  Greene follows Facebook Inc. founder  Mark Zuckerberg ,
investor  Carl Icahn  and 15 other wealthy U.S. individuals and
families, whose charity commitments were announced by the Giving
Pledge yesterday. Buffett started the program with Microsoft
Corp. co-founder  Bill Gates  this year to encourage billionaires
to increase their donations.  Greene failed this year to win the Democratic nomination
for a U.S. Senate seat from Florida. During the campaign, news
media focused on his friendships with boxer  Mike Tyson , who was
best man at his wedding, and  Heidi Fleiss , the convicted
“Hollywood madam.” Greene has a one-year-old son.  “While I intend to provide him a level of security, I
would never consider leaving him the vast amount of wealth that
I have been fortunate to accumulate,” Greene said of his son in
the letter, which was addressed to Buffett.  To contact the reporter on this story:
