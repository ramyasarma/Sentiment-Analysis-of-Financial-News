             Spain  will cut the preferential rate
for solar energy produced in ground-based plants built in the
second quarter by four percent after first-quarter demand
outstripped the number of available contracts 12 times over.  
 Spain will pay new installations 30.72 euro cents (39 cents)
per kilowatt-hour for 25 years, down from 32 cents in the first
quarter, the Industry Ministry said on its  Web site  today.  
 A rate of 45 cents a kilowatt-hour was paid to plants built
before September last year, creating a flurry of building. The
government decided to halt this by reducing the premium paid for
solar power and capping the number of qualifying plants.
Wholesale power for 2010 would today cost about 4.25 cents per
kilowatt-hour, according to broker ICAP Plc.  
 The industry ministry said today it would pay the 32 cent
rate to 392 projects built in the first quarter, 96 of them so-called solar orchards, or ground-based plants. The ministry said
the projects were assigned on a ‘first come, first served’ basis.  
 The register will allow the companies to build 66 megawatts
of free-standing installations, enough to power 90,000 homes,
60.08 megawatts of roof-mounted installations with a capacity of
more than 20 kilowatts and 6.67 megawatts of roof-mounted panels
with a lower capacity, which will be paid a higher rate of 34
euro cents a kilowatt-hour.  
 The ministry said that it would keep the payout and capacity
cap the same for roof-mounted equipment in the second quarter but
would increase the size of the register for ground-based
installations 43 percent to 94.5 megawatts.  
 Included in the  projects  which were given the go-ahead for
this quarter are two 10-megawatt plants, one in Cuenca owned by
 Avanzalia Solar SL  and the other in Rioja owned by Planta
Fotovoltaica Valdelaguna SL. The largest rooftop project will be
built in Cadiz, by  AMT Star Solar SA , with a capacity of 1.8
megawatts, the ministry said.
