             Nielsen Media Research , which
provides television ratings used to set advertising prices,
postponed for a second time a service that measure viewership of
commercials after cable networks questioned its accuracy.  
 Clients also had concerns about how to count replays on
digital recorders, Nielsen spokesman Gary Holmes said today in
an interview. The service was delayed indefinitely, after an
original start date of Nov. 18 was moved to Dec. 11.  
 Cable networks aren't convinced Nielsen's system can
properly distinguish between local and national advertisements,
said  Chris Jones , a spokesman for the New York-based
Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau. The bureau has advised its
members, cable networks that depend on advertising revenue, not
to participate.  
 ``We think that's probably a good idea'' to delay the
start, Jones said in an interview. ``It allows the industry to
debate the issue, to fix the current issues with the data.''  
 Nielsen plans to meet with clients later this month to try
to reach consensus on the use of devices including recorders
made by TiVo Inc. Nielsen, which had planned to measure viewing
on the day of broadcast and replays within seven days, may
consider a shorter period for replays, Holmes said.  
 ``There is some tension over what data stream to use,''
Holmes said. ``This is an issue we really need to discuss
further with clients.''
