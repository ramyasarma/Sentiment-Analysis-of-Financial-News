Stolichnaya signed a five-year accord
to become the official vodka of the Barclays Center, which will
be the home of the Russian-owned New Jersey Nets from 2012.  Stolichnaya, owned by the Moscow-based SPI Group, will have
exclusive branding around the Brooklyn facility and in the
arena’s six bars, an e-mailed statement from Brooklyn Sports &
Entertainment said yesterday. Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  “This partnership represents Stoli’s first long-term foray
into professional sports,” said Andrey Skurikhin, a partner at
SPI Group.  Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment plans to open the venue in
2012 for the Nets, whose purchase by  Mikhail Prokhorov  was
approved by National Basketball Association owners in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
