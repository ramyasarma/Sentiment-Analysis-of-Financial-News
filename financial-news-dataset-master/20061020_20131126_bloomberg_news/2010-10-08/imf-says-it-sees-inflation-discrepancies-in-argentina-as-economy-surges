International Monetary Fund Western
Hemisphere Director Nicolas Eyzaguirre said “discrepancies”
over Argentina’s inflation data are part of the Washington-based
lender’s dialogue with the South American nation.  Eyzaguirre, speaking to reporters at the IMF’s annual
meeting in Washington, said output in Argentina was growing
“way faster” than expected and domestic demand is “growing
fast.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
