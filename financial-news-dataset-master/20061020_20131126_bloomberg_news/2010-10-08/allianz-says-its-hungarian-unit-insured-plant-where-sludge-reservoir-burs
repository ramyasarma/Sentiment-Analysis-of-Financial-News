Allianz SE , Europe’s largest insurer,
said it insured the Hungarian aluminum plant where a toxic-
sludge reservoir burst earlier this week.  “The plant was insured by our subsidiary Allianz Hungaria
as the sole insurer both for liability as well as property
claims,” spokesman  Eduard Stipic  said by telephone today. He
declined to comment on the size of potential damages.  The reservoir of  Magyar Aluminium Zrt.  burst this week,
releasing as much as 700,000 cubic meters (25 million cubic
feet) of red sludge that flooded three towns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
