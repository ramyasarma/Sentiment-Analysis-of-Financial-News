Canadian housing  starts  fell in
September because of fewer single-family projects, government
figures showed.  Starts fell 1.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
pace of 186,400, compared with the 179,000-unit pace predicted,
according to the median of 16 responses in a Bloomberg survey.
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. increased its estimate for
August to 189,300 units from its originally reported 183,300.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said in a Sept. 30
speech that housing investment is “declining markedly” after a
temporary renovation tax credit expired and two provinces
applied a sales tax to some home sales.  Today’s figure, combined with the previous two monthly
reports, suggest “real residential construction spending will
wane and act as a drag on third quarter gross domestic product
growth,”  Derek Holt , vice-president of economics at Bank of
Nova Scotia’s capital markets unit in Toronto, said in a note to
clients.  Single family starts in cities fell 8.1 percent to 63,600
units while urban multiple were unchanged at 99,600 units.  “That isn’t good news for GDP because singles generate
more GDP per unit than multiples,” said  Krishen Rangasamy , an
economist with CIBC World Markets in Toronto, in a note to
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
