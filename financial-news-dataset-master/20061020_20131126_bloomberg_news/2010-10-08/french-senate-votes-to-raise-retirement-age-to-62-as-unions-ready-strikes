France’s Senate voted today in favor
of raising the legal retirement age to 62 from 60, part of
President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s pensions system overhaul.  Lawmakers in the  upper chamber of Parliament  voted 186 to
153 for the increase, the Senate press office said. The senators
are now debating increasing the eligible age for a full pension
to 67 from 65.  Raymond Soubie , Sarkozy’s social-policy adviser, told  RTL
radio today  the proposed plan should win final parliamentary
passage by Oct. 23. Sarkozy’s Union for a Popular Movement Party
holds a majority in both chambers.  Labor unions have said this week that they plan to stage
open-ended strikes starting Oct. 12 to protest the measure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
