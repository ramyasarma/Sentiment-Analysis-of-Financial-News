The government of Algeria rejected
 VimpelCom Ltd.’s  proposed $7.8 billion price for  Orascom
Telecom Holding SAE’s  Djezzy unit, and won’t negotiate with the
Russian company,  El Watan reported , citing a government source.  The government values the unit at $2 billion to $3
billion, and will deal only with Orascom, the Algiers-based
newspaper reported today.  Plans by VimpelCom, owner of Russia’s second-largest
mobile operator, to combine assets with Orascom have involved
it in a dispute with Algeria over taxes and ownership of
Orascom’s Algerian operations.  Talks between Orascom and  MTN Group Ltd.  over a possible
merger failed in June after the Algerian government blocked the
sale of Djezzy, and said it would make an offer for the
operator instead. Under an agreement to combine assets
announced Oct. 4, VimpelCom plans to take a 51.7 percent stake
in Orascom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
