U.S. stock futures retreated after
the government reported a bigger-than-estimated loss of jobs in
September, fueling concern the economic rebound will falter.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December slipped 0.4 percent to 1,151.9 at 8:32 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures decreased 44 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 10,868.  Employers cut staffing by 95,000 workers after a revised
57,000 decrease in August, Labor Department figures in
Washington showed today. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 5,000 drop. The
unemployment rate unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent.  The S&P 500 lost 0.2 percent yesterday as mining and energy
companies fell and PepsiCo Inc. led consumer-staples shares
lower. The index is down 4.9 percent from its 2010 high in April
amid concern an economic recovery has lost steam. It’s still up
13 percent from its 2010 low in July amid speculation the
Federal Reserve will buy more Treasuries to keep interest rates
low and bolster the economic recovery.    Alcoa Inc., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, started the
third-quarter earnings season after financial markets closed
yesterday. The first Dow Jones Industrial Average company to
report results posted profit that beat analysts’ estimates and
said growing Chinese demand will help boost global use by 13
percent this year.  Third-quarter earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to
have grown 23 percent from a year earlier, according to a
Bloomberg survey of analysts. The survey sees a 35 percent
advance in earnings this year compared with 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
