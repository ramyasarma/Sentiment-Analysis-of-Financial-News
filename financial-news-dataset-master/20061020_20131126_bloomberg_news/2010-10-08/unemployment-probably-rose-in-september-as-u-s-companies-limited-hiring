Unemployment  probably climbed in
September for a second consecutive month as slower U.S. growth
prompted companies to limit hiring, economists said before a
report today.  The jobless rate rose to 9.7 percent from 9.6 percent in
August, according to the  median estimate  of 83 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Payrolls excluding government
agencies rose by 75,000, while a drop in public staffing as the
decennial census wound down caused total hiring to decline for a
fourth straight month, the report may also show.  A lack of jobs underscores the concern expressed by some
Federal Reserve policy makers that the rebound from the worst
recession since the 1930s has been too slow and may require
easier monetary policy. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg project
unemployment will average at least 9 percent through 2011, which
may restrain  consumer spending , the biggest part of the economy.  “We’re probably going to have the unemployment rate march
steadily higher in this kind of growth environment,” said  Julia Coronado , chief economist for North America at BNP Paribas in
New York. “For a lot of companies, there still is just so much
uncertainty about where things are going. It’s very difficult
for businesses.”  The Labor Department’s report is scheduled for 8:30 a.m.
New York time. Private payroll estimates of the 60 economists
surveyed ranged from no change to an increase of 110,000.  Census Workers  Overall payrolls dropped by 5,000, according to the survey
median, reflecting the dismissal of about 78,000 temporary
workers hired to conduct the census.  Economists forecast factory hiring climbed by 2,000 workers
last month after an August decrease of 27,000, the first decline
of the year.  An unemployment reading as projected means the jobless rate
would have equaled or exceeded 9.5 percent for 14 consecutive
months, surpassing the 13-month period from mid 1982 to mid 1983
as the longest span of elevated joblessness since monthly
records began in 1948.  The report will also include a preliminary estimate for the
annual benchmark payroll revisions to be issued in February. The
projected changes, which will cover the period from April 2009
to March 2010, are based on state unemployment insurance tax
data that cover almost all employers and update the original
figures derived from a sampling of about 400,000 worksites.  Today’s figures will be the last employment data to come
out before elections on Nov. 2 that will determine which party
controls Congress. Support for President  Barack Obama  has fallen
as the unemployment rate has been slow to retreat.  Voter Discontent  Obama’s job approval over a three-day period that ended
Oct. 5 was 43 percent,  compared  with 53 percent at the same time
last year, according to a poll from Princeton, New Jersey-based
Gallup Inc.  The 763,000 increase in private payrolls in the eight
months through August shows it’ll take years to recoup the 8.4
million jobs lost as a result of the recession that began in
December 2007, the biggest employment slump in the post-World
War II era. The contraction ended in June 2009, according to the
National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S.
business cycles.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  surged 8.7 percent last
month, making it the biggest September gain since 1939, amid
speculation the world’s largest economy will avoid slipping back
into recession and bets that the Fed will buy more debt to
support the recovery.  The economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual pace in the second
quarter after expanding at a 3.7 percent rate in the first three
months of the year and 5 percent at the end of 2009, according
to the Commerce Department.  While some companies are still firing employees, others are
recalling workers. American Airlines, the third largest U.S.
airline, plans to recall 545 flight attendants and 250 pilots to
meet demand for international flights as it begins an alliance
with British Airways Plc and Spain’s Iberia. American, a unit of
