BNP Paribas SA said the Bank of
England may need to buy about 100 billion pounds ($159 billion)
of assets as part of a so-called quantitative easing plan to
boost the economy.  “The fact that government bond yields are so low
highlights a risk that asset purchases may have a smaller effect
on yields than during the first phase of QE,” a team of
interest-rate strategists led by Patrick Jacq  in Paris wrote in
a research note today. “We maintain our constructive outlook on
gilts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
