Palm oil climbed to the highest level
in more than two years as a weak dollar increased the appeal of
commodities as a hedge against inflation and as rival soybean
oil advanced on increased Asian demand.  The December-delivery contract rose as much as 0.8 percent
to 2,808 ringgit ($906) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest level since Aug. 8, 2008, and closed the
morning session at 2,782 ringgit. The commodity has gained 1.8
percent this week.  The dollar index,  which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, fell 1.1 percent
since Oct. 1, heading for a fourth week of losses, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  “Generally commodities have been gaining on the back of
weakness in the dollar,” said  Arhnue Tan , a senior analyst at
ECM Libra Capital Sdn. “There’s also a bit of ringgit play in
palm oil as the decline makes it cheaper for buyers.”  Malaysia’s ringgit is set for its first weekly drop since
August on concern the central bank will intervene to counter
gains that may hurt exports. The currency has risen 10 percent
this year and last week touched a 13-year high of 3.0825.  “The ringgit is expected to stay weak for the next three
months and that’s quite supportive for crude palm oil,” said
Tan. “Gains in crude oil have also been supportive for palm in
recent sessions.”  Malaysian Inventory  Shipments of Malaysian palm oil in September climbed 30
percent from August to 1.5 million tons, according to cargo
surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance. Rival Intertek put
the gain at 21 percent. Malaysian stockpiles advanced 23 percent
to 1.72 million tons in August from July, ending seven months of
losses, the nation’s palm oil board said Sept. 15.  The board is expected to issue stockpiles, exports and
output data for September on Oct. 11.  November-delivery soybeans in Chicago rose as much as 1.6
percent to $10.8225 a bushel, while December-delivery soybean
oil gained as much as 1.7 percent to 44.88 cents a pound in Asia.
Soybean and palm oils are direct substitutes.  U.S. exporters sold 947,400 tons of soybeans in the week
ended Sept. 30, including 624,300 tons to China, the largest
consumer, the Department of Agriculture said yesterday.  On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, palm oil for delivery in
May surged as much as 1.5 percent to 7,860 yuan ($1,178) a ton,
while May-delivery soybean oil lost as much as 1.2 percent to
8,492 yuan.  CME Group Inc.’s December palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, jumped for a fifth day to the highest
level since the exchange began trading in May. The most-active
contract leapt as much as 1.5 percent to $903.25 a ton and was
last at $900.25 at 1:08 p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
