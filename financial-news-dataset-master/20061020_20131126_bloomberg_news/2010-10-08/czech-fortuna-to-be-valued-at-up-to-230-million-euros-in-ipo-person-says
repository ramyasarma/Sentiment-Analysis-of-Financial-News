Fortuna Entertainment Group NV, the
Czech betting company planning to sell shares on the Prague and
Warsaw stock exchanges, will be valued at as much as 230 million
euros ($319 million), a person familiar with the terms of the
sale said.  The company will start bookbuilding on Oct. 11 for the sale
of a 35 percent stake, which would be valued at 80.5 million
euros at the maximum price, and will set the final price around
Oct. 20, said the person, who didn’t want to be identified
because the information hasn’t been made public yet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
