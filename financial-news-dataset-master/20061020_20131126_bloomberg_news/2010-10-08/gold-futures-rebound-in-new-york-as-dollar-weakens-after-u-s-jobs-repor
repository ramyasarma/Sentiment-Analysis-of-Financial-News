Gold futures rose, rebounding from
the biggest drop since July, as the dollar’s slump boosted the
appeal of the precious metal as an alternative asset.  The greenback fell to the lowest level against the yen
since 1995 after a report showed the U.S. lost more jobs in
September than economists estimated. Gold has climbed 23 percent
this year, reaching a record $1,366 an ounce yesterday.  “The uptrend in gold continues because the dollar just
continues to lose ground,” said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader
at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “There’s more downside in
the dollar. The jobs number just reinforces the fact that we’ll
see more quantitative easing.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $10.30, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $1,345.30 at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price dropped 0.9 percent yesterday, the most since
July 27. Gold gained 2.1 percent this week, the fourth straight
increase.  Earlier, futures fell as much as 0.7 percent, mirroring
swings in the dollar. The greenback headed for the fourth
straight weekly decline against a basket of major currencies.  U.S. employers cut staffing by 95,000 workers after a
revised 57,000 decrease in August, the Labor Department said
today. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News was a drop of 5,000. The unemployment rate held at 9.6
percent.  The Fed has kept the benchmark lending rate at zero percent
to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and purchased Treasuries and
mortgage-backed securities to inject more cash into the economy
and spur growth. Gold is headed for the 10th straight annual
gain.  ‘Retrenchment’  The metal may “exhibit a retrenchment in the near term,”
and fall to $1,300, said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global
Holdings Inc. in Chicago.  The 14-day relative-strength index, a gauge of price
momentum, has been above 70 since Sept. 22, a signal that prices
may decline. Gold reached a record in 14 sessions since Sept.
14.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 52.1 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $23.105 an ounce. Yesterday, the price reached
$23.53, the highest level for a most-active contract since
September 1980. The price gained 4.7 percent this week.  Platinum futures for January delivery gained $3.70, or 0.2
percent, to $1,708.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, capping a 1.6 percent gain for the week.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose 50 cents to
$587.60 an ounce. Yesterday, the metal reached $606.25, the
highest level since June 2001. The price climbed 2.2 percent
this week, the fourth consecutive increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
