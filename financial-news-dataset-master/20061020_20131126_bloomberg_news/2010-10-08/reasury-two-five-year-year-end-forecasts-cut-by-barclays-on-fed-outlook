Barclays Plc, one of the 18 primary
dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve, reduced its year-
end forecasts for yields on two- and five-year Treasuries with
policy markers expected to remain on hold through 2011.  Two-year notes will end the year at 0.3 percent, down from
a prior forecast of 0.7 percent, Barclays Capital said in a
research note today. Five-year notes will yield 2.4 percent at
the end of December, compared with a previous estimate of 3
percent, the firm said.   Barclays’s strategists cited the shift by the firm’s
economic staff for the Fed to hold rates steady next year, from
a previous call for an increase in the target rate for overnight
loans between banks in September 2011. Yields are likely to rise
in the second half of 2011, led by longer-maturity debt, as the
economy strengthens and the Fed begins to implement policies to
remove money from the banking system, Barclays said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
