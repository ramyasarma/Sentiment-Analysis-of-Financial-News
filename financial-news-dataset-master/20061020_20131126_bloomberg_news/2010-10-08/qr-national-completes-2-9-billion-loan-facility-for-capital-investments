QR National, Australia’s largest rail
freight company, finalized a A$3 billion ($2.9 billion) loan
facility with 11 banks ahead of its initial public offering by
the Queensland state government later this year.  The company, which carried more than 260 million metric
tons of coal, iron ore and other freight in the last financial
year, said in an e-mailed statement that proceeds from the
revolving floating-rate loan will go toward funding its capital
investment program. The loan includes a A$1.425 billion facility
maturing in three years and a A$1.575 billion facility due in
five, it said.  The transaction “allows QR National to start life as a
listed company with a strong relationship banking group,” Chief
Financial Officer Deborah O’Toole said in the statement.
Increased investment in infrastructure is necessary to meet
demand, particularly from the resources sector, she added.  Queensland’s government opened the sale of its coal freight
network to investors in September in a A$7 billion sale that may
become Australia’s largest equity offering since Telstra Corp.
in 2006. The nation’s third-most-populous state is selling
assets to prop up finances after the economic slowdown crimped
government revenue.  Moody’s Investors Service assigned a rating of Baa1, its
third-lowest investment-grade, to the loan facility, the first
time it has rated the company, it said in a statement.  In a revolving facility, money that’s been repaid can be
borrowed again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
