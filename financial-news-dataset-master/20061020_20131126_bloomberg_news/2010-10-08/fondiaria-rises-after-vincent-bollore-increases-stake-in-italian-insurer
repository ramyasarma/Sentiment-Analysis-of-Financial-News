Fondiaria-Sai SpA  rose after French
businessman  Vincent Bollore  boosted his stake in its parent
company, spurring speculation French companies may be interested
in Italy’s second-biggest insurer.  Fondiaria gained as much as 6.2 percent, the biggest
increase since Aug. 10, and was up 5 percent to 8.2 euros at
2:30 p.m. in Milan, giving the company a  market value  of 1.2
billion euros ($1.7 billion).  Bollore, vice chairman of  Assicurazioni Generali SpA ,
increased his stake in the Milan-based insurer’s holding
company,  Premafin Finanziaria SpA , to 2.4 percent from 2 percent
on Sept. 29, according to regulatory filings posted on financial
regulator Consob’s website today. Spokesmen for Bollore and
Fondiaria didn’t return calls seeking comment.  “The stake taken by Bollore in Prefamin has fueled M&A
speculation” with French players including Paris-based insurer
Groupama SA, Exane BNP Paribas analyst  Niccolo Dalla Palma  said
in a report today. He raised his recommendation on the stock to
“neutral” from “underperform.”  Bollore’s purchase in Premafin may be a prelude to an
interest in Fondiaria by Groupama, which wants to expand in
Italy, the newspaper  Il Corriere della Sera  reported today,
without saying where it got the information. A Groupama
spokesman declined to comment on the press report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
