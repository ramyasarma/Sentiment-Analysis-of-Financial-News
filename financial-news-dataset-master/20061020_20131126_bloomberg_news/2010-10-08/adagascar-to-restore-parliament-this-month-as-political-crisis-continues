Madagascar’s government will restore
parliament before next year’s elections, 18 months after
President  Andry Rajoelina  seized power with the help of the
military and closed the legislature.  A decree signed by Rajoelina yesterday will set up a 256-
seat Congress of the Transition and a 90-seat Higher Council of
the Transition, replacing the previous Senate and National
Assembly. The decree was e-mailed to the press late yesterday.  The two new chambers will include representatives from the
opposition, based on a “mutual agreement with the political
parties and takes into account the representation of the whole
political class,” according to the decree. The measure stems
from talks in August and September that were boycotted by the
opposition because they replaced a previous power-sharing
agreement supported by the international community.  Madagascar is scheduled for a referendum on a new
constitution next month, local elections in December,
parliamentary elections in March and a presidential vote in May.  The new parliament will convene between Oct. 11 and Oct. 26,
from Nov. 19 to Dec. 9 and again in February, according to the
decree. Members of the Congress of the Transition will be
appointed on Oct. 11, while those on the Higher Council will be
named on Oct. 12.  Mediation efforts by the South African Development
Community to find a power-sharing agreement between Rajoelina
and opposition leaders have failed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
