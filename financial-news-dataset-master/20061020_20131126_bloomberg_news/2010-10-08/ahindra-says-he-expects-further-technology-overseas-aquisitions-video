Anand Mahindra, vice chairman of 
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., talked with Bloomberg-UTV's Pranjal 
Sharma on Oct. 4 about the company's growth strategy.  Mahindra has tripled sales over five years, spurred by 
rising demand in India where his flagship company gets 96 
percent of revenue. To cut its reliance on the domestic market, 
Mahindra & Mahindra is in talks to buy South Korean automaker 
Ssangyong Motor Co., plans to sell trucks in the U.S. and is 
reviving Satyam Computer Services Ltd. after India’s biggest 
corporate scandal. (Source: Bloomberg-UTV)  Running time 20:31
