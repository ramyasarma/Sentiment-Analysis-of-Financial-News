Pakistan’s trade deficit widened by
27.4 percent in September as imports increased.  The trade gap widened to $1.16 billion in the third month
of the fiscal year, from $911.3 million a year ago, according to
a  statement  on the web site of the Federal Bureau of Statistics
in Islamabad today.  Overseas sales rose 7.4 percent to $1.62 billion, while
imports rose 14.9 percent to $2.78 billion, the data shows.  Pakistan is seeking to boost exports to sustain growth in a
country where the World Bank estimates a quarter of the
population lives on less than a dollar a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
