Vattenfall AB would take two or three
years to wind down operations in Poland if it decides to pull
out of the country, Jacek Piekacz, head of the largest Nordic
utility’s Polish unit, told reporters in Warsaw today, adding
that a decision will be made next year at the earliest.  Vattenfall has cancelled two planned coal-fired generation
projects, one on the Baltic coast and the other near the Zaklady
Azotowe Pulawy chemical plant, and will decide by the end of the
year whether to go ahead with its Siekierki heat and power
plant, Piekacz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
