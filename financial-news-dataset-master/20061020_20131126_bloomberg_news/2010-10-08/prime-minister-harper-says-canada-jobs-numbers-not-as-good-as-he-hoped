Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper said an employment report today showing a loss of 6,600
jobs was a “mixed bag” and wasn’t as strong as he hoped.  Harper also told reporters in Edmonton, Alberta, that the
government will stay focused on the economy and switch its focus
to deficit reduction next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
