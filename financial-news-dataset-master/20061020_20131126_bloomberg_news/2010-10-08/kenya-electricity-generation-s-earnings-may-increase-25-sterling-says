Kenya Electricity Generating Co.,  the
nation’s biggest power producer, may post average growth in
earnings of 25 percent each year until 2014 as the economy
expands, boosting demand, Sterling Investment Bank said.  Earnings per share may increase to as much as 4.46
shillings per share by fiscal 2014 from 0.94 shilling for 2009,
Nairobi-based Sterling wrote in a note to clients dated
yesterday, in which it said it initiated coverage of the stock
with a “buy” recommendation and price estimate of 24.32
shillings per share.  “The positive economic outlook will drive increased
consumption for electricity as industries increase output and
more consumers are connected to the power grid,” according to
Sterling. “KenGen should be able to grow its revenue through
the planned capacity expansion projects.”  Growth in East Africa’s biggest economy may exceed the
government’s 4.5 percent to 5 percent target for 2010 after
expansion accelerated to an annual 5.4 percent in the second
quarter, Central Bank of Kenya Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said on
Oct. 1. Kenya had power capacity of 1,310 megawatts as of June
30 2009, with KenGen generating 80 percent of that. Demand for
power may increase to 2,100 megawatts by 2013 and KenGen is
expected to develop an additional 1,140 megawatts by 2014,
Sterling said.  The margin of earnings before interest tax, depreciation
and amortization may climb to 75.9 percent in the financial year
ending June 2014 from the current 67.6 percent, Sterling said.  In the year through June 2009, KenGen reported profit of
2.07 billion shillings ($27.5 million) and sales of 12.7 billion
shillings. The company is yet to announce earnings for year
through June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
