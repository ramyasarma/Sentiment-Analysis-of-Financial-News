The dollar dropped below 82 yen for
the first time in 15 years as the U.S. payrolls report showed
employers cut more jobs last month than economists forecast,
heightening concern the economic recovery is stalling.  The greenback was headed for a fourth weekly decline
against the euro in the longest stretch of losses since December
2008 as investors speculated the Federal Reserve will debase the
currency by stepping up purchases of government debt. The yen
and Swiss franc rose today versus most major counterparts as
investors sought easily traded alternatives to the dollar.  “It is basically increasing the odds for quantitative
easing, which means more creation of dollars, and the dollar
falls across the board,” said  Sebastien Galy , a currency
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness” with  Margaret Brennan .
“It’s a pretty good bet dollar-yen will continue to go lower.”  The dollar decreased 0.3 percent to 82.15 yen at 4:27 p.m.
in New York, from 82.41 yesterday. It touched 81.73, the lowest
level since April 1995. The U.S. currency traded at $1.3930 per
euro, compared with $1.3926. The euro slid 0.3 percent to 114.45
yen, from 114.75.  Stocks rallied on the prospects for Fed policy easing,
pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 11,000 for the
first time since May. Gold rose after touching a record $1,366
an ounce yesterday. Twelve of 18 traders, investors and analysts
in a Bloomberg News survey said the metal will gain next week on
demand for an alternative to the dollar. Yields on two- and
five-year Treasury notes fell to record lows.  Dollar Index  The  Dollar Index , used by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to
track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners including the euro and yen, slid 0.2 percent to
77.26, from 77.39 yesterday, when it touched 76.91, the lowest
level since Jan. 15.  The yen gained 0.9 percent to 13.64 South Korean won and
appreciated 0.3 percent to 12.34 versus the Swedish krona. The
franc gained 0.3 percent to 96.38 centimes versus the dollar
after appreciating yesterday to a record 95.55.  U.S. employers cut staffing by 95,000 workers after a
revised 57,000 decrease in August, Labor Department figures in
Washington showed today. The median forecast of 87 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey was for a drop of 5,000. The
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent.  ‘Dollar Pressured’  “People are taking the numbers and continuing to price in
quantitative easing,” said  Brian Kim , a currency strategist at
UBS AG in Stamford, Connecticut. “You’re going to see the
dollar pressured.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Oct. 4 that the
central bank’s first round of large-scale asset purchases aided
the economy and that further quantitative easing is likely to
help more. The Federal Open Market Committee is next scheduled
to meet Nov. 2-3.  The central bank completed in March a program in which it
created new money to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-
backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt,
debasing the dollar. The Fed was the biggest buyer of Treasuries
when it purchased $300 billion of U.S. debt in 2009.  The Bank of Japan adopted this week a 5 trillion yen ($60
billion) program aimed at lowering long-term borrowing costs and
the premiums on corporate debt. It also cut its benchmark
overnight interest rate for the first time since 2008, dropping
it to a range of zero to 0.1 percent.  “It becomes a question of who prints the most, and as you
see the yen strengthened today,” said  Bill Gross , manager of
the world’s biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management
Co., in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “There is the assumption that the U.S. will print more
than Japan on a relative basis.”  Weekly Drop  The dollar fell 1.3 percent versus the yen this week in a
third decline, while the greenback’s fourth weekly loss pushed
the euro down 1 percent. The greenback slid for five straight
weeks through Dec. 26, 2008, after the Fed cut the target
lending rate to a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  of Japan told reporters
today in Tokyo before departing for a Group of Seven meeting in
Washington that the nation doesn’t intend to return to the long-
term, large-scale intervention campaigns of the past.  Japan acknowledged intervening in the currency market on
Sept. 15, when the yen strengthened to 82.88 per dollar. Chief
Cabinet Secretary  Yoshito Sengoku  said then that the finance
ministry “seems to think” 82 is the line of defense to protect
the nation’s export-dependent economy.  Flaherty’s View  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty , who chairs the G-7
gathering, said this week that “there are concerns about
interventions in currency markets” and that he’s “sure” the
issue will be discussed.  Swiss Finance Minister  Hans-Rudolf Merz  said the “currency
war” issue “hasn’t played a role in today’s discussions”
during an International Monetary Fund meeting in the U.S.
capital.  The Canadian dollar erased losses against the greenback as
the U.S. employment numbers outweighed a weaker-than-expected
Canadian jobs report also released today.  The loonie appreciated 0.6 percent to C$1.0128 per U.S.
dollar, extending its sixth straight weekly gain to 0.9 percent.
The Canadian currency has gained more than 5 percent since Aug.
31, when it touched an eight-week low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
