Former Arcandor AG Chief Executive
Officer  Thomas Middelhoff ’s home and office were searched
yesterday as part of a probe into the company’s bankruptcy.  Bochum prosecutors are investigating about 20 people over
Arcandor’s demise, Gerrit Gabriel, a spokesman for prosecutors,
said in an interview today. Investigators raided premises at
nine sites throughout Germany, he said. Cologne prosecutors are
leading a related probe, he said.  The case was prompted by allegations last year that
Middelhoff decided not to sue a Cologne fund for several million
euros over property leased by Arcandor’s Karstadt department-
store chain. The probe is reviewing whether there was any
misconduct leading to Arcandor’s insolvency.  Middelhoff’s lawyer Sven Thomas said the raids were
unnecessary because his client had already offered to supply
prosecutors with documents. Middelhoff denies wrongdoing, Thomas
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
