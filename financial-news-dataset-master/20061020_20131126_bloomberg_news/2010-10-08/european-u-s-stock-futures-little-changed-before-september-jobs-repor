Most  European shares  fell as a
government report showed the U.S. economy lost more jobs than
estimated in September, increasing the likelihood that the
Federal Reserve will be forced to act to shore up the recovery.  Barclays Plc  slid 2.2 percent after Abu Dhabi bought
protection against a loss in value of its entire 6.3 percent
stake. Actelion Ltd. rallied 10 percent after the Wall Street
Journal reported that Switzerland’s largest biotechnology
company may sell itself.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  was almost unchanged at 262.27
as of the 4:30 p.m. close in London, as four stocks declined for
every three that advanced. The gauge has gained 1.2 percent this
week amid speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may follow
the Bank of Japan in unveiling another round of stimulus
measures to prop up the flagging economic recovery.  The U.S. jobs report “brings quantitative easing all the
more closer,” said  Philippe Gijsels , head of research at BNP
Paribas Fortis Global Markets, in a phone interview from
Brussels. “Bernanke is waiting with his $1.5 trillion dollar
gun, ready to shoot. In the long term it’s still worrying to me
that the economy is in this state.”  U.S. employers cut staffing by 95,000 workers after a
revised 57,000 decrease in August, Labor Department figures in
Washington showed today. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 5,000 drop. The
unemployment rate unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent.  Easier Policy  A lack of jobs underscores the concern expressed by some
Fed policy makers that the rebound from the worst recession
since the 1930s has been too slow and may require easier
monetary policy.  National benchmark indexes declined in 10 of the 18 western
European markets today. France’s CAC 40 fell 0.2 percent and the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped less than 0.1 percent. Germany’s DAX
gained 0.3 percent.  The Stoxx 600 has rallied 13 percent since its low this
year in May as concern eased that the region’s sovereign-debt
crisis and slowing growth in China and the U.S. will curb
 corporate profits , while central banks signaled they stand ready
to act should a slowdown in the economy worsen. Japan’s central
bank unexpectedly cut its overnight interest rate to a range of
zero to 0.1 percent on Oct. 5 and said it would set up a 5
trillion yen ($60 billion) fund to buy assets in an effort to
head off deflation and bolster growth.  Barclays  Barclays  sank 2.2 percent to 297.25 pence. Abu Dhabi’s
 Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed  Al Nahyan bought protection against a
loss in value of his stake in the U.K. lender from Nomura
Holdings Inc., which hedged its commitment by selling 220
million Barclays shares.  Nomura sold the shares at 295 pence per share, for a total
of 649 million pounds ($1 billion), according to two people
familiar with the deal.  Sage Group Plc  declined 4.6 percent to 269.6 pence after
UBS AG cut its recommendation on the shares to “sell” from
“neutral,” saying it is skeptical about the possibility of any
buyers for the U.K.’s largest software maker.  Gecina SA dropped 5.3 percent to 86 euros after Banco
Castilla-La Mancha sold 1 million shares in the French real-
estate company for 86 euros each.  Amadeus IT Holding SA  retreated 2.9 percent to 13.48 euros
as some shareholders sold a stake in the flight-reservations
provider for as much as 617 million euros ($857 million) after
the stock gained more than 25 percent since its initial public
offering in April.  BC Partners, Cinven  Private-equity firms BC Partners Ltd. and Cinven Ltd. each
sold 4.4 percent of Amadeus, cutting their respective holdings
to 13 percent, the company said in a filing. Spanish airline
Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA sold another 1.5 percent
stake, reducing its holding to 7.5 percent. The shares went for
13.50 euros each.   Credit Suisse Group AG  fell 1.9 percent to 42.4 Swiss
francs after Barclays downgraded the shares to “underweight”
from “equal weight,” saying the Swiss bank has more of a
capital shortfall than UBS AG and is trading “more
expensively,” according to a report today.  Actelion rallied 10 percent to 49.34 francs, the biggest
gain in more than three years. The company has formed a
committee of board members to evaluate alternatives and has
hired a financial adviser, the Wall Street Journal reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
