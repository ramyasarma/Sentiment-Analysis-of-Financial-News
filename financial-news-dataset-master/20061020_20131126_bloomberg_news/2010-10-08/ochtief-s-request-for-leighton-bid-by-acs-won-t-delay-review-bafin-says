Germany’s financial regulator said a
Hochtief AG request seeking to force  Actividades de Construccion
y Servicios  into an offer for a subsidiary as part of a bid for
the builder won’t delay its review of the transaction.  ACS, Spain’s largest builder, must file details of the
offer no later than four weeks after announcing the bid on Sept.
16, unless an extension is granted. ACS already owns close to 30
percent in Germany’s largest construction company and wants to
raise its stake just over 50 percent over time. Hochtief is
trying to repel the bid, saying it doesn’t add value.  Hochtief has filed a request with Australia’s securities
regulator, seeking to force ACS to make offer for the
outstanding shares in Australian builder Leighton Holding Ltd.
should it gain “effective control” over Hochtief. Hochtief
owns 54.5 percent of Leighton.  Sabine Reimer , a spokeswoman at Bafin, said Hochtief’s
attempt to add Leighton to the mix “doesn’t play a role” for
the German regulator’s review. ACS has said the claim by
Hochtief is “groundless.” Hochtief spokesman  Christian Gerhardus  declined to comment on Bafin’s assessment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
