BHP Billiton Ltd. , majority owner of
the world’s largest copper mine, may boost copper output from
existing operations 65 percent by 2020, according to a report
from Deutsche Bank AG.  Mill throughput expansions at the Escondida, Spence and
Antamina mines in South America will boost output to 1.9 million
metric tons in the financial year ending June 30, 2020, up from
an expected 1.15 million tons during the current fiscal period,
analysts led by  Paul Young  said following a visit to the
operations.  Planned expansions, including replacing Escondida’s
existing concentrator at a total cost of $3.3 billion by 2016,
should provide steady production growth, Deutsche said. BHP owns
a 57.5 percent stake in Escondida, the world’s largest mine for
the metal.  At the Antamina mine in Peru, where BHP owns a 33 percent
stake, a $1.3 billion expansion to produce 130,000 tons of
copper annually “appears to be tracking ahead of schedule,”
Deutsche said.  Copper futures this week rallied to the highest level in
almost 27 months, reaching $8,259 a ton on the London Metal
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
