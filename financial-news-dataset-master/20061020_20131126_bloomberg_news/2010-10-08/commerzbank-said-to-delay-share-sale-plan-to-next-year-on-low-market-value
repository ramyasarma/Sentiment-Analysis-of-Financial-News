Commerzbank AG , Germany’s second-
biggest bank, doesn’t plan to pursue a share sale this year
because the stock price is too low, according to two people with
knowledge of the talks.  The Frankfurt-based lender’s management met earlier this
week and agreed with its investment banks that a capital
increase should be delayed until 2011, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private. If the
share price rebounds, the bank may reconsider its plans, they
said. Commerzbank spokesman  Reiner Rossmann  declined to comment.  Chief Executive Officer  Martin Blessing  reiterated last
month that a share sale is among options under consideration to
return 16.4 billion euros ($23 billion) in government capital.
The bank, which plans to start paying back state aid no later
than 2012, expects to return to profit this year.  Commerzbank closed up 3.3 percent at 6.34 euros in
Frankfurt today. The stock has gained 7.7 percent this year,
valuing the company at about 7.5 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
