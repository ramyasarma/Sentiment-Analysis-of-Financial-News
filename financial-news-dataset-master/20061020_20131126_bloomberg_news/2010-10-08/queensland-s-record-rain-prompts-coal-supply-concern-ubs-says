Queensland’s wettest September in 100
years has prompted concern that further rainfall may crimp coal
output from the Australian state and drive up prices, according
to a report from UBS AG.  “The market is comparing this event with that of 2008,”
when tropical storm Helen crossed the eastern coast, causing
production and stockpiles to fall and prices to rise, UBS
analysts led by Sydney-based Glyn Lawcock said in an Oct. 7
report. “The market’s wary about high rainfall undermining
supply” ahead of the Queensland cyclone season.  Queensland, which produces 95 percent of the nation’s sugar
and is the country’s largest coal exporter, may get more
tropical storms than average this season because of the La Nina
weather pattern, the Bureau of Meteorology said Oct. 4. The
state’s cyclone season extends from November to April.  La Nina occurs every three to five years and can last nine
to 12 months, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration. The weather event can disrupt farm
output in Asia and intensify hurricane development in the
Atlantic Ocean. Australia is the world’s largest shipper of
coal and the third-biggest exporter of sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
