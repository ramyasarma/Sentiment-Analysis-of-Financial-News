CF Industries Holdings Inc.  led
fertilizer makers higher in New York trading after the U.S.
government cut a corn-crop forecast and Reuters reported that
Rio Tinto Group is interested in the industry.  CF , based in Deerfield, Illinois, rose $11.26, or 11
percent, to $109.90 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, the biggest gain since Dec. 16, 2008.
Canada’s  Agrium Inc.  climbed 7.5 percent to $81.08 and Plymouth,
Minnesota-based  Mosaic Co.  advanced 6.6 percent to $65.61.  A smaller-than-expected crop this season may lead to higher
corn plantings and fertilizer demand next year, said  Charles Neivert , an analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. in New York. CF
benefits the most among fertilizer companies from an advance in
corn,  Chris Damas , a Barrie, Ontario-based analyst at BCMI
Research, said in an e-mail.  “It’s the best pure-play trading vehicle for nitrogen
fertilizer in the U.S., which is in a sweet spot,” Damas said.
“Limit-up corn equals buy more nitrogen fertilizer stocks.”  Corn, soybean and wheat prices surged by the most allowed
on the Chicago Board of Trade after the USDA today cut its
estimates of supply. Corn rose 20 percent this year before today
as weather reduces yields. Rio, the world’s third-largest mining
company, regards potash, a crop nutrient, as an “attractive”
industry, Reuters reported, citing Harry Kenyon-Stanley, head of
Rio’s minerals and diamond unit.  Weaker Dollar  “The bulk of today’s move is coming from” the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s crop forecast report,  Edlain Rodriguez , a New York-based analyst at Gleacher & Co., said in a
telephone interview. “Rio’s interest in fertilizer assets is
adding to the fire.”  Terry Huch , a spokesman for CF, said most of the gain was
likely due to the USDA’s supply and demand report.  “It also doesn’t hurt that the dollar is weakening and oil
is rising,” he said in an e-mail.  The  Dollar Index  which tracks the greenback against the
euro, yen, pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Swedish
krona, slid as much as 0.3 percent today after reaching the
lowest level since Jan. 15 yesterday. Crude oil climbed intraday
to more than $83 a barrel.  Canada’s  Potash Corp.  of Saskatchewan Inc. rose 3.5 percent
to $145.80 in New York. Melbourne-based BHP Billiton Ltd. has
made a $40 billion bid for Potash.  Monsanto Co.,  the world’s largest seed company, rose 4.2
percent to $50.87. Farm-equipment makers also gained.  Deere &
Co.  rose 4.8 percent to $75.35,  CNH Global NV  climbed 8.5
percent to $40.89 and  Agco Corp.  gained 3.6 percent to $40.66.  Meat processors that use corn as animal feed declined.
 Tyson Foods Inc . dropped 7.7 percent to $15.01,  Sanderson Farms
Inc.  tumbled 4.7 percent to $39.52 and  Smithfield Foods Inc. 
fell 6.7 percent to $14.97.  To contact the reporters on this story:
