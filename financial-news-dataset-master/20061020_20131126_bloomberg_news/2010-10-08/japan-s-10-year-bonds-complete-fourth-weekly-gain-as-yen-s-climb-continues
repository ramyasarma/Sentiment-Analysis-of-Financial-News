Japan’s 10-year  bonds  completed a
fourth weekly gain on speculation the yen’s climb to a 15-year
high will pressure the central bank to ease policy further.  The  difference  in two-year yields between U.S. and Japanese
bonds narrowed on Oct. 7 to the least since December 2008,
helping push the yen higher against the dollar, said  Shinji Nomura , chief debt strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.
The Bank of Japan cut interest rates on Oct. 5 and said it may
buy government debt and other assets to reinvigorate the economy.  “With the yen remaining strong, expectations may rise that
the Bank of Japan will expand easing efforts, such as increasing
its asset-purchase fund,” said Tokyo-based Nomura. “Investors
are moving into long-term bonds.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond has declined 10
basis points this week to 0.855 percent at Japan Bond Trading
Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 0.8
percent security due September 2020 was auctioned on Oct. 7. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery have added 0.63
to 143.95 this week at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Benchmark 10-year yields have fallen 29.5 basis points over
the past four weeks and touched 0.82 percent on Oct. 6, the
lowest level since July 1, 2003.  Japan’s currency strengthened to 82.11 per dollar on Oct. 7,
a level not seen since May 1995. On Sept. 15 when the yen
advanced to 82.88, Japan sold the yen to weaken it for the first
time since 2004. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas
sales at Japanese companies when repatriated.  BOJ Purchases  The BOJ this week said it will set up a 5 trillion yen ($61
billion) fund to buy government debt, exchange-traded funds and
real-estate investment trusts. Bank of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  said on Oct. 7 in Washington that the stronger yen has
hurt Japan’s economy by eroding exporters’ earnings.  Gains in bonds were limited after demand dropped at a 10-
year debt auction on Oct. 7. The 2.2 trillion yen sale drew bids
valued at 2.85 times the amount on offer, compared with a ratio
of 3.16 in September. The coupon was set at 0.8 percent, the
lowest payout for 10-year securities since June 2003.  China sold a net 2.02 trillion yen in Japanese debt in
August, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday in Tokyo, the
biggest monthly sale in data going back to 2005. China bought a
record 735.2 billion yen of Japanese debt in May and another
1.04 trillion yen the following two months.  The “ministry report suggests China had purchased yen-
denominated assets not to diversify their foreign reserves but
to temporary escape from the unstable financial situation in
Europe,”  Yasunari Ueno , chief market economist at Mizuho
Securities Co. in Tokyo, wrote in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
