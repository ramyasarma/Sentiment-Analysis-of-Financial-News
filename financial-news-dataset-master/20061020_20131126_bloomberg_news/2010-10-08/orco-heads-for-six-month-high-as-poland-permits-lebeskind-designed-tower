Orco Property Group SA  shares gained,
heading for their highest in almost six months, after Polish
authorities allowed the developer to resume construction of its
flagship Daniel Libeskind-designed apartment tower in Warsaw.  Orco  advanced  as much as 3.7 percent and traded 1 percent
higher at 201 koruna as of 10:48 a.m. in Prague, taking its
increase so far this week to 7 percent. More than 70,000 shares
changed hands, almost three times the three-month average.  The governor of the province of Mazovian Voivodship, where
Warsaw is located, confirmed the “validity and effectiveness”
of the previously suspended building permit for the Zlota 44
project, the Luxembourg-based company said late yesterday. Orco,
which is reorganizing its debt under a court-approved plan, will
resume construction in 8 to 12 weeks.  “We remain slightly positive on the stock,” analyst  Petr Bartek  at  Ceska Sporitelna AS , the Prague-based unit of  Erste
Group Bank AG , wrote in a report to clients today. The project
may generate between 7 euros and 8 euros of gross profit per
undiluted share, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
