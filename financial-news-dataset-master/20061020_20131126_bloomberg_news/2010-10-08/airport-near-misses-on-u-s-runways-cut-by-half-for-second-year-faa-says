Aircraft near-misses on U.S. runways
fell by half for a second straight year as regulators credited
steps such as pilot training and better signs.  The most serious types of close calls dropped to six in the
year ended Sept. 30, from 12 in the previous year, the Federal
Aviation Administration reported. The agency recorded 24 or more
incidents annually in the nine years before 2009, reaching a
high of 67 in 2000.  “The goal we are working towards is zero runway
incursions,” FAA Administrator  Randy Babbitt  said in a
 statement  today by the Washington-based agency.  Cutting incursions has been a top priority of the FAA and
safety advocates for the past decade. Agency and industry
efforts have included better markings on pavement, improved
training on how the near-misses occur and embedded runway lights
to warn pilots of potential collisions.  Three of the six near-misses in fiscal 2010 involved
commercial airliners, up from two in 2009, according to the FAA.
Nine of the near-misses involved commercial planes in 2008 and
accounted for 34 in 2000.  To contact the reporter for this story:
