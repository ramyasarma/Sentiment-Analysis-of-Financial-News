Sugar jumped to the highest price in
almost eight months on concern that demand will outstrip
supplies after adverse weather damaged crops in Brazil, the
world’s biggest producer. Coffee and cocoa also climbed.  Brazil will harvest 3.2 percent less sugar cane than
previously estimated in the year that began May 1, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said this week. The U.S. will use
115,000 metric tons more of the sweetener this season because of
“strong demand for imported sugar,” the USDA said today.  “Demand is really strong for Brazilian sugar,” said  Phil Streible , a senior-market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker
in Chicago.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 1.16 cents, or 4.6
percent, to settle at 26.32 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Prices jumped 13 percent this week,
the most since August 2008.  Earlier, the price touched 26.68 cents, the highest level
since Feb. 17. The commodity may rise to 30 cents in the next
week, Streible said. Sugar has gained 83 percent since June 1.  Falling U.S. corn supplies will push sugar prices higher as
demand increases from fuel makers, Streible said. The U.S. corn
crop will be 3.8 percent smaller than forecast a month ago, the
USDA said today.  Lower corn production will “drive ethanol prices higher
and that will roll over to the sugar market,” Streible said.  In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery
gained $27.80, or 4.3 percent, to settle at $677.60 a metric ton
on NYSE Liffe at 5:30 p.m. local time.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery rose 8.7
cents, or 5 percent, to $1.8215 a pound in New York. Prices
jumped 0.6 percent this week. On NYSE Liffe, robusta-coffee
futures for November delivery advanced 2.1 percent to settle at
$1,655 a ton in London.  Cocoa futures for December delivery gained $63, or 2.3
percent, to settle at $2,803 a ton in New York. The chocolate
ingredient was up 0.7 percent for the week. In London, December-
delivery cocoa rose 1.6 percent to 1,870 pounds ($2,982) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
