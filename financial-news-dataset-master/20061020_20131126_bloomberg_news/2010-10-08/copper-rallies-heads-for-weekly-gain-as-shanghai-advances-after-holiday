Copper rebounded, on pace for its
longest winning streak in nine months, as the dollar declined
and investors in China bought the metal after London Metal
Exchange prices advanced during the country’s week-long National
Day holiday. Lead and nickel gained.  Three-month delivery copper added as much as 0.8 percent to
$8,165 a metric ton, after losing as much as 0.7 percent earlier.
Futures reached a 27-month high of $8,326 on Oct. 6 and traded
at $8,146 by 11:20 a.m. Singapore time, up by 0.5 percent this
week. Prices have risen for a fourth week, the longest period of
advance since the four weeks ending Jan. 8.  “The weakness in the dollar is definitely aiding the rally
in metals prices,” Pan Jinghua, an analyst at Citic Futures Co.,
said from Shanghai. “Fundamentally we’re moving into the peak
demand season and this should help sustain the rally.”  Copper in London advanced 1.1 percent from Oct. 1-7 as the
 dollar  slid on prospects for a further easing of monetary policy
by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy. It fell against a
six-currency basket including the euro and yen on speculation
the U.S. central bank will debase the dollar by stepping up
purchases of government debt to support the economic recovery.  January-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
rose as much as 1.4 percent to 61,450 yuan ($9,211) a ton, the
highest level since April 16, and was at 61,040 yuan at the
midday break. China’s financial markets re-opened today.  “The gap between London and Shanghai got too large in the
past week,” Jia Zheng, a trader at Soochow Futures Co., said
from Shanghai. “If Chinese investors try to play catch-up in
Shanghai, it may help support London prices.”  China Property  Copper in Shanghai declined as much as 1.1 percent earlier
after Shanghai introduced new measures to curb soaring home
prices including restricting home purchases to one per household,
increasing the supply of residential land, and using a property
tax to cool the real estate market.  Property prices in 70 major cities rose 9.3 percent in
August from a year earlier, prompting the government to extend a
crackdown on speculators and multiple home purchases. Measures
taken since April include curbing loans for third-home purchases,
increasing down-payment requirements and raising mortgage rates.  The latest measures are “more significant than expected,”
Deutsche Bank AG analysts led by  Tony Tsang  wrote in a report
dated yesterday. “This in our view highlighted the strong
determination of the central government and local governments to
cool down the property market.”  Aluminum in London gained 0.9 percent to $2,345.25 a ton,
lead climbed 1 percent to $2,230 a ton and nickel rose 1 percent
to $24,128 a ton. Zinc was unchanged at $2,261 a ton, while tin
added 0.4 percent to $25,700 a ton at 11:36 a.m. in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
