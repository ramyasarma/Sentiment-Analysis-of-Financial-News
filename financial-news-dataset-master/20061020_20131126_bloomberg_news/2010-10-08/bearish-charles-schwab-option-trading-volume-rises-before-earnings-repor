Trading of bearish  Charles Schwab
Corp.  options surged to a six-week high before the brokerage’s
earnings report next week as an investor bet that the shares
will fall 15 percent by January.  More than 17,300 puts to sell Schwab shares changed hands,
24 times the four-week average and nine times the number of
calls to buy, yesterday in New York. The shares slid 0.7 percent
to $14.15 to extend this year’s loss to 25 percent.  Almost all  of the put volume was concentrated in January
$12.5 puts, which rose 11 percent to 50 cents, after one
investor bought 14,000 options in a bet the largest independent
brokerage by client assets will fall 15 percent, to about $12,
by expiration, according to Patrick Mortimer, director of
options trading at Pipeline Trading Systems LLC in New Hope,
Pennsylvania.  The “option buyer may be looking at the tough time the
company has had recently and looking for protection ahead of
next week’s third-quarter earnings release,” Mortimer wrote in
a note yesterday.  Schwab, whose shares reached a one-year high of $19.88 in
April before dropping to a low of $12.76 end of August, said in
regulatory filing on Aug. 5 that trading commissions -- which
account for one fifth of revenue -- fell 8 percent to $214
million last quarter from a year earlier. The decline resulted
from the brokerage’s lower online fees, implemented in January,
and less market trading activity, the San Francisco-based firm
said.  Schwab is  expected  to report a third quarter profit
excluding some costs of 13 cents a share on Oct. 15, according
to a Bloomberg survey of 22 analysts covering the stock. That
would be down from a profit of 17 cents a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
