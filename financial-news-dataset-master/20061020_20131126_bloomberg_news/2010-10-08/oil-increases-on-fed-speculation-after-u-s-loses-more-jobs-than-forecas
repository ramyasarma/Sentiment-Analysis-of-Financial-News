Crude oil climbed above $82 a barrel
amid speculation the Federal Reserve will buy more debt to
stimulate the economy after a government report showed the U.S.
lost more jobs than forecast in September.  Oil rose 1.2 percent as the dollar pared gains following
the Labor Department report. The Fed may purchase bonds in a
strategy known as quantitative easing, weakening the U.S.
currency and boosting dollar-denominated commodities.  “It’s back to the currency trade,” said  Rich Ilczyszyn , a
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.
“Quantitative easing is definitely on the table. The Fed may
increase the money supply to keep rates relatively low and
inspire people to take on risk.”  Oil for November delivery rose 99 cents to settle at $82.66
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures increased
1.3 percent since Oct. 1, the third straight weekly gain. It was
the longest stretch of weekly advances since June. Prices have
advanced 15 percent in the past year.  Brent crude for November settlement jumped 60 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $84.03 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London.  The unemployment numbers “are making quantitative easing
all the more likely, so crude, like all other dollar assets,
should soar,” said  Alexander Ridgers , head of commodities at
London-based CMC Markets, which handles more than $150 million a
day in U.S. crude contracts.  Jobs Report  Earlier, oil fell as much as 1.7 percent as the Labor
Department said employers cut staffing by 95,000 workers,
reflecting a decline in government payrolls that shows the
damage being done by rising fiscal deficits.  The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News called for a drop of 5,000.  “The jobs number was lousy,” said  Phil Flynn , a Chicago-
based analyst and trader with investment adviser PFGBest. “The
Fed has indicated that the recovery won’t be official in their
eyes until the job market recovers.”  The dollar was little changed against the euro at $1.3915
per euro at 3:15 p.m. in New York from $1.3926 yesterday.
Earlier, it gained as much as 0.7 percent.  The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities surged
2.7 percent to 295.11, the highest level since October 2008. All
19 commodities increased.  Deutsche Bank AG raised its fourth-quarter 2010 and first-
quarter 2011 forecasts for both Nymex and Brent oil to $80 a
barrel, a level compatible with equity and currency levels,
according to a report today by  Adam Sieminski , chief energy
economist. The bank’s previous forecasts, in mid-September, were
$70 for the fourth quarter and $75 for the first.  Equities Rise  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.6 percent to
1,165.15, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 57.9, or
0.5 percent, to 11,006.48.  Bill Gross  of Pacific Investment Management Co., who runs
the world’s biggest bond fund, said the report is a “strong
signal” for further Fed action, in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . The Fed will likely
buy $100 billion in government securities a month to keep
borrowing costs down, he said.  Federal Reserve policy makers said Sept. 21 that they
“will provide additional accommodation if needed” as the
recovery and job growth have slowed.  The U.S. unemployment rate unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent
in the Labor Department report today. Projections of 83
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the report ranged from
9.6 percent to 9.8 percent.  Inventories at Wholesalers  Inventories at U.S. wholesalers rose 0.8 percent in August,
the Commerce Department said today, more than the 0.5 percent
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 34 economists, as companies
kept stockpiles in line with demand.  A strike at the Fos and Lavera oil terminals at the French
port of Marseille left 19 crude-oil tankers and 26 oil-product
tankers waiting to load or discharge, Inchcape Shipping Services
said in a notice on its website today.  At least four French refineries may be forced to start
shutting down operations this weekend. The strike may endanger
local fuel supplies as early as Oct. 18, said  Jean-Louis Schilansky , head of refiners’ organization Union Francaise des
Industries Petrolieres, in a telephone interview today.  Crude may decline next week as U.S. inventories increase
and fuel consumption drops, a Bloomberg News survey showed.
Seventeen of 33 analysts, or 52 percent, forecast crude oil will
decline through Oct. 15. Twelve respondents, or 36 percent,
predicted an increase, and four estimated prices will be little
changed. Last week, 42 percent said crude would climb.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 769,285
contracts as of 3:20 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 968,579
contracts yesterday, 44 percent above the average of the past
three months and the highest level since Sept. 10. Open interest
was 1.41 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
