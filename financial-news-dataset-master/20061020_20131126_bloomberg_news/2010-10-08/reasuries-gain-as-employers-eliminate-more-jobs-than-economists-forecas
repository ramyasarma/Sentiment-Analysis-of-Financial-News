Treasury  two- and five-year note
yields slid to record lows as data showing U.S. employers cut
more jobs than forecast last month spurred speculation the
Federal Reserve will buy more bonds to stimulate the economy.  Ten-year note  yields fell to the lowest level since January
2009 as investors bet the floundering labor market signals
weaker-than-expected growth in the broader economy. Yields have
slid this week as investors speculated the Fed will purchase
more assets, a strategy called quantitative easing. Bank of
America Corp. said very “strong data” would be needed to stop
the central bank from launching a purchase program in November.  “In the eyes of the market, the employment report
strengthened the case for additional asset purchases,” said
 Richard Bryant , senior vice president in fixed income at MF
Global Inc. in New York, a broker of exchange-traded futures.
“It didn’t show the type of improvement that would be needed to
dissuade the Fed from further QE.”  The two-year  note yield  slipped 1 basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 0.347 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The yield touched 0.3351
percent, the least ever, marking the sixth straight day it has
set or matched a record low. The 0.375 percent security due in
September 2012 traded at 100 2/32.  The  five-year  note yield fell 2 basis points to 1.1 percent
and dropped as low as 1.0686 percent, setting a record for the
fifth consecutive day. The yield on the 10-year note rose 1
basis point to 2.39 percent after touching 2.3302 percent, the
lowest level since Jan. 20, 2009. Treasury notes gained for a
fourth straight week, with the 10-year yield falling 12 basis
points and the 2-year yield decreasing 7 basis points.  The  30-year bond  yield rose 3 basis points to 3.75 percent.  Treasury Auctions  Thirty-year bonds and 10-year notes erased advances today
as the Treasury prepared to sell $66 billion in 30-, 10- and 3-
year securities next week at auctions that begin Oct. 12.  “The market has refocused its attention to the next order
of business -- supply,” MF Global’s Bryant said.  The Fed will likely announce an initial buying program of
$500 billion over the next six months, but promise additional
buying power “if necessary,”  Ethan Harris , head of developed-
markets economic research in New York at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch Global Research, one of 18 primary dealers that trade with
the Fed, wrote in a note to clients. Harris expects the yield on
the 10-year note to fall to 2 percent by year-end.  No ‘Fixed Endpoint’  Barclays Plc, another primary dealer, said in a note to
clients today it expects the central bank to start a buying
program in November, “with an announcement on the flow of
Treasury purchases, such as $100 billion per month, without a
fixed endpoint.”  The firm revised its year-end forecast for the 2-year yield
to 0.3 percent, from 0.7 percent, and lowered its prediction for
the 10-year yield to 2.4 percent, from 3 percent, according to
figures it released today.  Bill Gross , manager of the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, California,
said the Fed will likely buy $100 billion in government
securities a month to keep borrowing costs down. The central
bank may purchase $1.2 trillion in Treasuries, he said. Policy
makers next meet Nov. 2-3.  The  difference  between the yields on 10-year notes and 30-
year bonds reached 1.37 percentage points, the highest level
since Bloomberg began keeping the data in 1992, as investors
speculated the Fed would focus its purchases on shorter-term
Treasury securities.  Outside ‘Buy Zone’  “The 30-year seems to be outside of the Fed’s buy zone for
quantitative easing,” said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt
research at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. “It’s one of
the few parts of the U.S. Treasury market that you can sell on a
short-term basis if you want to reduce exposure to bonds and
increase it in other sectors.”  Employers eliminated 95,000 jobs after a revised decrease
of 57,000 in August, Labor Department figures in Washington
showed today. The median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 5,000-position drop. The
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent.  Private payrolls that exclude government agencies increased
64,000, less than forecast.  The gap in  yields  between 30-year bonds and similar
maturity inflation-indexed debt widened to 2.34 percentage
points, the most since June 28, as speculation increased that
the central bank will resume buying Treasuries. The spread is an
indication of inflation expectations over the life of the
securities. It was at a 15-month low of 1.84 percentage points
on Aug. 25.  Treasury 10-year notes fell earlier after a policy maker
cast doubt on the likelihood the central bank will boost bond
purchases. Fed Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said
the economy hasn’t slowed enough to make the need for
quantitative easing obvious.  To contact the reporter on this story:
