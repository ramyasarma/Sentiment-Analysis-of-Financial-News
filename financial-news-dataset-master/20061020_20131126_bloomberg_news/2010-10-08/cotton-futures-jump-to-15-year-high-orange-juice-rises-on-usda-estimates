Cotton futures jumped to a 15-year
high after the U.S. Department of Agriculture boosted a forecast
for global demand. Orange-juice prices also climbed.  Global use  will increase to 120.8 million bales in the year
that began Aug. 1, up 0.2 percent from last month’s estimate,
the USDA said today. Worldwide output will be 116.7 million
bales, down from the September forecast of 117 million. For the
second straight day, cotton futures jumped 4 cents a pound, the
most allowed by ICE Futures U.S.  “The bullish news was in the world numbers,” said  John Flanagan , the president of Flanagan Trading Corp in Fuquay-
Varina, North Carolina. “High prices are not rationing out
demand yet.”  Cotton for December delivery rose 3.42 cents, or 3.3
percent, to settle at $1.0717 a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1.0775, the highest level for
a most-active contract since June 19, 1995.  This week, the commodity jumped 9.3 percent, the most since
mid-February. Inventories monitored by ICE tumbled 47 percent in
the past three days.  The fiber is up 68 percent in the past 12 months, while
stockpiles plunged 97 percent.  Output in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter, will be
0.2 percent more than forecast a month ago after beneficial
weather boosted yields in Texas and the Mississippi River Delta,
the USDA said.  A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Chinese Demand  Prices also climbed on renewed demand from China, the
biggest buyer, said  Gary Raines , an economist at FCStone Fibers
& Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee. China’s markets opened after
National Day holidays.  China is forecast to boost imports 19 percent to 13 million
bales next year, the USDA said. Demand for the fiber soared
after excessive rains damaged crops and delayed this year’s
harvest.  The nation will produce 31.5 million bales, a 3.1 percent
drop from September’s projection, the agency said.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 2.55 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to settle at $1.5375 a pound. Earlier, the price
jumped as much as 3.6 percent.  Florida, the second-biggest orange grower, will produce 146
million boxes in the harvest getting under way, the USDA  said 
today. The average forecast of six analysts and traders in a
Bloomberg News survey was 150.7 million boxes. A box weighs 90
pounds, or 41 kilogram.  Weather Concerns  Orange output in the citrus belt in Brazil, the world’s
largest producing region, may fall more than expected this year
to the lowest level since 2001 as below-average rains reduce
yields, Sucocitrico Cutrale Ltda. said last month.  The USDA forecast was bullish, said Stephanie Kinard, a
market strategist at Chicago-based Brewer Futures Group. “We
don’t really have any reserves because of what’s going on in
Brazil,” she said.  Independent forecaster  Elizabeth Steger  in August projected
Florida’s orange harvest would be 154 million boxes, while Louis
Dreyfus Citrus Inc. forecast a crop of 149 million boxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
