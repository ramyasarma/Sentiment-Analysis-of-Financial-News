Serbia needs to reduce spending more
and foster investment to ensure the economy grows an average
annual 5.8 percent through 2020, a government study backed by
the U.S. Agency for International Aid shows.  The report’s growth model, presented by the prime
minister’s economic advisers, would help Serbia avoid an
external liquidity crisis in the next three years, when it needs
around 3 billion euros ($4.16 billion) a year to repay debt.  “Probably the most important risk is the one related to
foreign debt and external liquidity sustainability,” said
 Stojan Stamenkovic , a member of the team that produced the
report. He called for a cut in foreign trade and current-account
deficits to offset pressure on the country’s external liquidity.  Serbia holds elections in 2012, with the ruling coalition
of pro-Western parties and the Socialists struggling to bolster
the economy, whose growth rate at less than 2 percent this year,
can’t counter a 3.5 percentage point jump in unemployment to
more than 20 percent. Serbia’s application for European Union
membership in December will be forwarded to the European
Commission this month.  The model forecasts growth domestic product to expand to
52.7 billion euros in 2020 or 7,500 euros per capita. Domestic
consumption will need to stay below GDP growth rates, expanding
by an average annual 4.7 percent over the next 10 years,
according to the report.  Rising Employment, Inflation  Employment would rise by 16.9 percent, or 440,000 new jobs,
with productivity up by more than 50 percent, the report shows.  After 2011 and 2012, when the inflation rate is seen at 5
percent and 4 percent respectively, the annual consumer-price
increase should slow to 3 percent in 2013 and stay there until
2020.  “By 2015, the dinar exchange rate would be depreciating by
2 percent a year, staying neutral afterwards,” matching the
difference in inflation rates in Serbia and the Euro zone,
according to the report.  The model assumes Serbia will attract 22.7 billion euros
through 2020. A cumulative current-account deficit during the
period is estimated at 17 billion euros and gross new external
borrowing at 51.1 billion euros.  Foreign debt servicing will remain high in the next five
years as the private sector repays debts, and will account for
“around 40 percent of export revenues” through 2015, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
