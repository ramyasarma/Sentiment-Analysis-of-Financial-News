South African Finance Minister Pravin
Gordhan said the rand is too strong given the country’s economic
fundamentals, Reuters reported.  “The rand is too strong given the South African context,
and we share the concerns of other emerging markets,” Reuters
said, citing a statement by Gordhan to reporters before a
meeting of world finance ministers at the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank this weekend.  South Africa’s Finance Ministry is “working with the
Reserve Bank” to deal with the rand’s strength, Reuters quoted
Gordhan as saying in response to a question on whether policy
makers should be accumulating more foreign reserves to stem
currency gains.  “More means you have got to find more resources; nothing
comes for free in this business,” Reuters quoted Gordhan as
saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
