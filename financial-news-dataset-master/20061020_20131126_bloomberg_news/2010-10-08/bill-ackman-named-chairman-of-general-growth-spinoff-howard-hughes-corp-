General Growth Properties Inc.  said
 Bill Ackman  will be chairman of Howard Hughes Corp., the spinoff
that will consist of the company’s portfolio of master-planned
communities and other real estate assets.  The move is expected to occur upon General Growth’s exit
from bankruptcy in early November, according to a statement
today from the Chicago-based company. Ackman’s Pershing Square
Capital Management LP is among the firms that’s investing in the
new company as part of General Growth’s restructuring. He was a
director of the mall owner from June 2009 to March of this year.  General Growth, which filed the largest real estate
bankruptcy in history in April 2009, is separating its
traditional retail properties from its master-planned community
and commercial development operations. The spinoff includes New
York’s South Street Seaport and Summerlin, a 22,500-acre Las
Vegas community formerly owned by the estate of billionaire
aviator Howard Hughes.  “The Howard Hughes name -- which reflects the success and
vision of one of our country’s greatest entrepreneurs -- is a
fitting brand for this world-class portfolio of real estate
assets,” Ackman said in the statement.  Howard Hughes Corp.’s chief executive officer will be
announced after the spinoff is completed, General Growth said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
