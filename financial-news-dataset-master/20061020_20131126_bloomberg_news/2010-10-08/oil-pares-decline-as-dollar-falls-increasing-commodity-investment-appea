Oil reversed losses in New York as
the dollar fell against the euro, increasing the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment.  Crude earlier declined as much as 0.7 percent after the
euro strengthened 0.3 percent against the greenback. U.S.
payrolls excluding government agencies probably increased in
September, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists
before a report today, supporting traders’ expectations that the
economy is stabilizing in the world’s largest oil consumer.  “The weakening dollar is putting a reasonable floor under
the price of oil,” said  Gavin Wendt , a director at commodity
analysts Mine Life Resources Ltd. in Sydney. “Everyone is
looking for an indication of the underlying health of the
economy. A lot of speculators have bet on oil to push higher.”  Crude for November delivery was unchanged at $81.67 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 2:52 p.m. Singapore time. The contract earlier lost as much
as 56 cents to $81.11. Yesterday, it plunged $1.56, or 1.9
percent, to $81.67, the biggest drop since Sept. 16.  The U.S. currency was at $1.3941 against the euro, slipping
from $1.3926 yesterday in New York, when it slumped to $1.4029,
the weakest since Jan. 28. Investors tend to buy commodities
when the dollar falls.  U.S. Payrolls  Oil, set for a third weekly gain, has climbed 3 percent
this year amid speculation the global economic recovery would
boost fuel demand.  Private payrolls in the U.S. probably increased 75,000 in
September after slowing to a 67,000 gain in August, according to
a Bloomberg News survey. Overall nonfarm payrolls may have
declined by 5,000 last month.  “If the jobs figure were to be negative, that might have
some impact on oil, pushing it lower,” said Wendt at Mine Life.
“But that will be offset by the realization that the Federal
Reserve will step in with more stimulus and that will mean a
lower dollar and higher oil.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Oct. 4 the central bank’s
first round of large-scale asset purchases, known as
quantitative easing, aided the economy and further buying is
likely to help more.  Brent crude for November settlement was at $83.52 a barrel,
up 9 cents, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. The
contract earlier lost as much as 40 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$83.03 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
