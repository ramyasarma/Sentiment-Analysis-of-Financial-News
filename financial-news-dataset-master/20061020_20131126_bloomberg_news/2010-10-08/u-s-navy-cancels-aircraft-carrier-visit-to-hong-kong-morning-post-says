The U.S. Navy canceled a visit to
Hong Kong by aircraft carrier USS George Washington because of
operational reasons, the South China Morning Post reported,
citing Commander Jeff Davis.  The cancellation wasn’t due to any action by the Chinese
government and visits by other ships are going ahead as
scheduled, the Morning Post said, citing Davis, a spokesman for
the U.S. Pacific fleet.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
