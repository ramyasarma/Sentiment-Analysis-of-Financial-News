GDF Suez SA , owner of Europe’s
biggest natural gas network, plans to sell about 2.5 million
metric tons of liquefied natural gas to China National Offshore
Oil Corp., according to a person familiar with the agreement.  The deal is worth about $1 billion for around three years
and is similar to the one the Paris-based utility signed last
month with  Korea Gas Corp. , the world’s biggest buyer of LNG,
the person said, declining to be identified because the
agreement has yet to be announced.  GDF Suez Chief Executive Officer  Gerard Mestrallet  will
attend a signing ceremony in Shanghai tomorrow.  The French utility last month announced it had reached a
deal with the South Korean state-run utility for it to purchase
a total of 2.5 million metric tons through 41 cargos starting
this year and ending in 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
