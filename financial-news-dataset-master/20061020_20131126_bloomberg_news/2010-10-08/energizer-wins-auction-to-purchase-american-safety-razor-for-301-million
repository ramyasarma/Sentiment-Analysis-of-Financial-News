Energizer Holdings Inc. , known for
its battery-powered pink  bunny  and Schick shavers, won an
auction to buy bankrupt competitor American Safety Razor Co.
with an offer of $301 million.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Mary F. Walrath  in Wilmington,
Delaware, picked Energizer’s offer over a bid by American
Safety’s lenders, who wanted to trade the $244 million debt owed
to them for ownership of the maker of surgical blades and wet-
shave razors.  Walrath overruled the first choice of American Safety’s
board, which said it preferred the lower bid from the lenders
because it had a better chance of winning approval from U.S.
antitrust regulators. American Safety attorney Mark Thompson
said before Walrath ruled that the board would abide by her
decision and cooperate with Energizer to close the sale.  American Safety “finds itself in the best of all possible
worlds,” Energizer attorney  Lloyd Palans  said in court. “It
has both the bird in hand and $57 million more than the bird.”  The lenders have agreed to buy American Safety should the
Energizer bid fail to close. Energizer has until Nov. 23 to win
regulatory approval.  American Safety filed for bankruptcy protection in July
with plans to sell itself to lenders. The company blamed its
bankruptcy on increased competition for inexpensive shavers and
the loss of its biggest customer,  Wal-Mart Inc.   The bankruptcy case is In re American Safety Razor Co., 10-
12351, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
