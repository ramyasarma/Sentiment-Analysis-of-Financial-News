RioZim Ltd . has been granted a
license by Zimbabwe to build a 2,400-megawatt thermal power
station, which may more than double the national power supply,
the state-controlled  Herald  said, citing the Zimbabwean miner’s
managing director,  Joshpat Sachikonye .  RioZim plans to build the plant in phases, with the first
unit generating power in 2014 and completion expected in 2020,
the Harare-based newspaper said on its website. The license will
make it easier for the miner to attract investors in the
generator, which will cost in the billions of dollars, the
Herald said without specifying the amount.  The plant will be built near RioZim’s Sengwa coal field,
which will supply the generator. Sengwa, north of Harare, has
estimated reserves of about 1.3 billion metric tons of non-
coking coal, which is best suited to a power station, the
newspaper said.  RioZim is the first Zimbabwean company to be granted a
license to generate electricity independently of the state-owned
Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority, the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
