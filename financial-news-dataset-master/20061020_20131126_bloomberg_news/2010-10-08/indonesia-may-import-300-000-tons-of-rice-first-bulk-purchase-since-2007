Indonesia, the world’s third-largest
rice producer, may have to import 300,000 metric tons of the
grain, the first bulk purchase since 2007, to meet an expected
shortfall in government supplies, Bulog executives said.  “Now our stockpiles are about 1.2 million metric tons and
we should have 1.5 million tons in December,”  Sutarto Alimoeso ,
president director at the state food company, told reporters in
Jakarta today. “We are prepared to buy 300,000 tons of rice
from Thailand and Vietnam.”  Rice is Indonesia’s most important staple and the country
has been self-sufficient for the last two years. Southeast
Asia’s largest economy last imported white rice for consumption
in 2007, shipping in about 1.2 million tons, mostly from Vietnam
and Thailand.  Bulog , which manages the government’s stockpiles,
buys the crop from farmers during harvests and sells the grain
later to help keep prices stable.  “We cannot buy sufficient supplies from farmers because
longer-than-normal rains have reduced the yield, which led to a
decline in output and quality,” Alimoeso said. Indonesia
imports small amounts of speciality rice every year.  Bulog will continue to buy good-quality rice from farmers
even as it imports, Alimoeso said. He met with traders and
officials from Thailand and Vietnam last week, discussing the
import plan.  Unhusked rice output may gain a less-than-targeted 1.2
percent to 65.15 million tons this year because of a decline in
harvested area,  Rusman Heriawan , head of the Central Statistics
Office, said July 1. The government had targeted 3.5 percent
growth to 66.7 million tons of rice.  A La Nina weather event has brought heavier-than-usual
rainfall to parts of Australia and Asia this year, including
Indonesia. The rains have been blamed by industry groups in the
country for lower output or missed forecasts for cocoa, tin,
palm oil and coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
