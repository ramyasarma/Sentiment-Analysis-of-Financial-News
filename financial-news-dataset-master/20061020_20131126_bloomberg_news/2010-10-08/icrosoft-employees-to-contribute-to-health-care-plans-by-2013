Microsoft Corp. , the world’s largest
software company, said it will require employees to contribute
to their health-care benefits starting in 2013, citing the
rising cost of providing worker coverage.  About 95 percent of the company’s roughly 90,000 employees
have benefits covered completely,  Lou Gellos , a spokesman for
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, said in an interview today.
He said he didn’t know what portion employees will be asked to
provide.  “The cost of health care has, over the years, increased
dramatically,” Gellos said in an interview today. “The
projections going forward have them going way up, and in order
to be sustainable, some sort of evolution of our health benefit
was necessary.”  Some of the largest companies in the U.S. project a median
8.3 percent increase in health-care costs next year, according
to the  National Business Group on Health , a Washington-based
nonprofit organization. Microsoft may be considering a “modest”
change in benefits, said  Helen Darling , the group’s president.  “Even with the evolution and changes they have in mind,
which I think are modest, it will still be way up there in terms
of comprehensiveness and relatively low cost to the employee,”
Darling said. Her group has nearly 300 members, including
Microsoft.  The average U.S. employee contribution to health-care plans
is 20 percent, she said.  Microsoft  gained  4 cents to $24.57 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading. The stock has declined 19 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
