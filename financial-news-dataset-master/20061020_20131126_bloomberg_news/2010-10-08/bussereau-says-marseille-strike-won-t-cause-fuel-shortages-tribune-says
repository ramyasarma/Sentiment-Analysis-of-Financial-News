French Transport Minister Dominique
Bussereau told La Tribune in an interview that the country will
not face fuel shortages as a result of the continuing strike at
the port of Marseille’s oil terminals.  There are reserves in continental Europe worth several
months of consumption and France is securing extra supplies to
ensure that there will be no shortages in service stations,
Bussereau told La Tribune.  The oil companies will bear the cost of these supplies, he
added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
