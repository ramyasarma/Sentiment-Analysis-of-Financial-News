Quarterback  Kevin Kolb  will start in
place of the injured  Michael Vick  when the  Philadelphia Eagles 
play the  San Francisco 49ers  this weekend.  Vick, 30, sustained cartilage damage and a small fracture
of a rib when he was tackled by  Washington Redskins  cornerback
 DeAngelo Hall  and safety  Kareem Moore  near the goal line in last
week’s 17-12 loss.  Eagles Coach  Andy Reid  said on Oct. 4 that Vick’s
availability would be a “day-to-day, week-to-week” thing.  Vick was replaced by  Kolb , who completed  22-of-35  passes
for 201 yards, a touchdown and an interception against
Washington. The Eagles (2-2) travel to San Francisco (0-4) for
an Oct. 10 game and host the Atlanta Falcons, Vick’s former
team, on Oct. 17.  Vick moved into the starting lineup after Kolb, 26,
suffered a concussion in a Week 1 loss to the Green Bay Packers.
Vick then led the Eagles to wins over the Detroit Lions and
Jacksonville Jaguars, throwing for six touchdowns and no
interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
