Corn slipped in Chicago, erasing a
gain, as investors may be unwilling to purchase contracts before
the release of a U.S. Department of Agriculture production
report.  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the USDA to
forecast yields at 160.2 bushels an acre, below last month’s
government estimate of 162.5 bushels, as hot weather in August
stunted growth. Still, some investors may be concerned that the
USDA’s yield estimates will exceed those of analysts, said  Doug Whitehead , an analyst at Rabobank in London.  “There are so many different outcomes that could arise
that everybody is happy to be sitting on the fence this
morning,” Whitehead said. “If we see a big reduction in yield,
that could be quite bullish. If the USDA doesn’t reduce yield as
much as everybody expects, that could be quite bearish.
Everybody is happy to take a wait-and-see approach.”  Corn for December delivery slipped 0.75 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $4.975 a bushel at 12:47 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade after earlier rising as much as 1
percent. The USDA report is due for release at 8:30 a.m. in
Washington.  “It’s position-squaring before the USDA issues its monthly
estimates,” as the grain gained 7 percent this week before
today, said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager of research at
IDO Securities Co. in Tokyo.  2009 Record  U.S. corn output may fall to 12.977 billion bushels,
according to the Bloomberg survey, compared with last year’s
record 13.11 billion and the USDA’s September forecast for this
harvest of 13.16 billion bushels.  Farmers National Co., the largest manager of cropland,
expects a bigger decline in yields this year than the survey,
forecasting a drop to 156.6 bushels an acre this year, according
to Jerry Warner, chief management officer. A national yield at
that level would produce a harvest of 12.677 billion bushels.  Wheat was little changed, paring early advances on
speculation that futures will follow corn as the grains compete
as a source of livestock feed.  “The big driver for wheat even now is still going to be
that corn-yield number and whether any acreage shifts,”
Rabobank’s Whitehead said. “Wheat, for the most part, has been
a market driven by corn in recent times.”  Milling Wheat  Wheat for December delivery advanced 0.75 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $6.60 a bushel. The grain has risen 0.8 percent this
week after two weekly declines.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris added 0.2 percent to 208.50 euros ($289) a metric ton.  Ukraine, the world’s fourth-biggest corn supplier and
fifth-largest wheat exporter, set quotas on shipments of all
grains to ensure food security and cap domestic prices, First
Deputy Prime Minister  Andriy Klyuev  said yesterday.  The restrictions may run through the end of this year, he
said. Corn exports will be limited to 2 million metric tons and
wheat and barley to 500,000 tons each, he said.  “The majority of people were anticipating a number around
there,” Whitehead said. “It certainly has some bullish
implications, though it was mostly anticipated.”  Soybeans for November delivery rose 8 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $10.73 a bushel in Chicago. The oilseed has gained
14 percent since the end of May on record demand from China.  Rough rice for November delivery fell 0.8 percent to $12.69
per 100 pounds, erasing an increase of as much as 0.3 percent to
$12.83. Prices yesterday climbed as high as $12.88, the highest
price since April 26. The contract has advanced 2.6 percent this
week, gaining for a seventh week, the longest winning streak
since Nov. 23, 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
