Rubber in Tokyo retreated from a more
than five-month peak after Japan’s currency surged against the
dollar, weakening the appeal of yen-based contracts. Shanghai
futures set a two-year high after a week-long holiday.  Futures in Tokyo dropped for the first time in four days,
losing as much as 1.8 percent to 318.5 yen per kilogram ($3,871
a metric ton). The price had earlier gained to 326.5 yen, the
highest price since April 21. Shanghai contracts surged to as
much as 28,020 yuan ($4,200), the highest level since July 2008
as they resumed trade after the National Day holiday.  “The strengthening tone of the yen put pressure on the
Tocom prices,” Sureerat Kunthongjun, an analyst at AGROW
Enterprise Ltd., said by phone from Bangkok.  The yen yesterday gained to a 15-year high on expectations
that the Federal Reserve will expand credit-easing steps and on
prospects that Japan will avoid currency-market intervention
before today’s meeting of finance ministers and central bankers
from the Group of Seven industrialized nations. China’s stocks
and commodities rose after retail sales surged during the
holiday, adding to signs of the strength in the economy.  “Rubber was supported by speculation that Chinese buyers
may step up purchases after the holiday,” Shuji Sugata,
research manager at Mitsubishi Corp. Futures Ltd., said today by
phone. “Futures in Tokyo were sold because of a stronger yen
and a slump in industrial commodities overnight.”  The March-delivery contract fell 0.5 percent to settle at
322.7 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, also known as Tocom.
The March contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained 2.9
percent to close at 27,655 yuan.  Dollar Slumps  The dollar traded near the lowest level since 1995 against
the yen on burgeoning speculation the Federal Reserve will
debase its currency by stepping up purchases of government debt
to support the economic recovery.  The dollar stood at 82.45 yen at 4:14 p.m. in Tokyo from
82.41 yen in New York yesterday when it touched 82.11 yen, the
lowest since May 1995.  U.S. private nonfarm payrolls rose by 75,000 in September
after an increase of 67,000 in the previous month, according to
the median forecast of 60 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before today’s report from the Labor Department. The jobless
rate is expected to increase to 9.7 percent from 9.6 percent.  The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 3.1 percent to 2,738.74.  The auctioned price of ribbed smoked sheets in Thailand
dropped 0.3 percent to 105.89 baht ($3.52) a kilogram tracking
lower crude oil prices, the Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand said on its website today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
