Credit Agricole SA , France’s third-
largest bank by market value, raised A$900 million ($884 million)
in its first issue of kangaroo bonds, helping push sales of the
securities this year to a record.  The bank sold A$275 million of 6.5 percent  notes  that were
priced to yield 6.61 percent, according to an e-mailed statement
from Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which helped manage the
sale. The Paris-based lender also sold A$625 million of
floating-rate notes priced to yield 125 basis points more than
the three-month bank bill swap rate. Credit Agricole initially
planned to sell at least A$300 million of notes.  Demand for the bonds due October 2013 was strong as
investors sought “exposure to a new name,”  John Manning ,
Sydney-based senior credit strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, said by phone today. “One of the main drivers for
offshore issuers is that the basis swap remains attractive.”  Borrowers including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and
Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank sold almost A$2.1 billion of
notes this week, taking kangaroo issuance in 2010 to an all-time
high of more than A$33 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. JPMorgan Chase & Co. became the first non-
supranational or agency issuer to sell kangaroo bonds since 2008,
with a A$1 billion offering in March.  Basis Swap  The basis swap, which measures the cost of exchanging
greenback-based debt for Aussie dollars, closed at 22 basis
points yesterday after averaging 10.7 basis points in the past
10 years, Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. Borrowers typically use cross-currency basis swaps to
exchange floating-rate payments in one currency to another.  The swap rose to a record 50 basis points on Nov. 26, due
to an increase in U.S. dollar bond sales by Australian banks.
That meant kangaroo bond sellers -- who make the opposite
transaction -- got the biggest-ever discount.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Credit Suisse
Group AG, RBC Capital Markets and Credit Agricole CIB also
helped manage the French bank’s sale of kangaroo bonds today,
according to the statement.  Rentenbank, Germany’s development agency for agribusiness,
today added A$400 million to its existing line of 6.5 percent
kangaroo notes due in April 2017.  CIBC, Canada’s fifth-biggest bank, yesterday raised A$750
million in the first sale of Australian dollar covered bonds
since the start of the credit crisis in 2007.  The previous record for sales of kangaroo bonds,
Australian-dollar notes sold by foreign issuers in Australia,
was A$32.4 billion in 2006, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
