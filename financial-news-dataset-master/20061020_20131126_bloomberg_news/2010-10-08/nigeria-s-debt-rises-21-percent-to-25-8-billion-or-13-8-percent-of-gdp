Nigeria’s total public debt rose 21
percent last year to $25.8 billion, or 13.8 percent of gross
domestic product, the  Debt Management Office  said.  External debt increased 6.2 percent to $3.95 billion, the
Abuja-based office said in an annual report published on its
website today. Domestic debt increased to $21.8 billion from
$17.7 billion a year earlier.  After securing a debt write-off pact with the Paris Club of
19 creditor nations in 2006, Nigeria has focused its
international efforts on concessional loans from institutions
such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank, the
debt office said in the report. Nigeria has repaid $12 billion
to creditors and had another $18 billion written off to cut the
debt from $35 billion.  Last year, 85 percent of its public borrowing was from the
domestic market, while 15 percent came from abroad, according to
the report. The local component climbed from 83 percent in the
previous year, according to DMO.  The West African country sold 694 billion naira ($4.6
billion) in bonds last year, encouraged by the “increasing
appetite of its burgeoning investors,” the report said, without
saying how much was sold the year before.  The objective of the debt management strategy is to
“maintain the sustainability of the total debt profile,”
 Abraham Nwankwo,  director general of the DMO, said in the
report.  Oil and gas account for 90 percent of the country’s export
earnings and 16 percent of GDP, according to the  National Bureau
of Statistics . Nigeria’s economy, the second-biggest on the
continent after South Africa, is expected to grow 7.8 percent in
2010, up from 7 percent last year, driven by non-oil industries
such as agriculture,  Central Bank of Nigeria ’s governor,  Lamido Sanusi , said on Sept. 21. The country is the fifth-largest
source of U.S. crude imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
