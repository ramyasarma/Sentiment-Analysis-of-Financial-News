Westpac Banking Corp.  is likely to
reduce its workforce in the next few years as Australia’s
second-biggest lender upgrades technology systems to boost
productivity, Chief Executive Officer  Gail Kelly  said.  “We’d expect the overall level of employees next year and
the year after to reduce,” after an increase this year, Kelly
told analysts at a briefing today, according to a transcript of
the event prepared by Bloomberg. A spokeswoman for Sydney-based
Westpac confirmed the remarks.  Kelly said the bank will try to use “natural attrition”
and redeployment of staff to achieve the lower payroll level,
without detailing the size of the planned cut to headcount. The
bank is due to publish  full-year earnings  on Nov. 3.  Westpac has about 37,000 employees in Australia, New
Zealand and around the world, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter for this story:
