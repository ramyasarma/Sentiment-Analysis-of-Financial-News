Canadian stocks  rose, capping a
weekly gain, as agriculture stocks soared after the U.S. cut its
estimate of the corn harvest and energy and metal prices
advanced on speculation of further central-bank stimulus there.  Agrium Inc., Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer,
increased 7.1 percent after the U.S. Agriculture Department said
corn production will decrease from last year’s record. Suncor
Energy Inc., Canada’s biggest oil and gas producer, climbed 2.8
percent after the U.S. reported more job losses than most
economists had forecast. Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest
base-metals and coal producer, rose 2.5 percent as copper
surged.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rallied 89.66
points, or 0.7 percent, to a two-year high of 12,535.59 for a
1.4 percent weekly increase.  “Everyone now expects the U.S. Fed to come to the rescue
of the system, probably starting in November,” said  Adrian Mastracci , a money manager at KCM Wealth Management Inc. in
Vancouver, referring to the Federal Reserve. “They see a white
knight coming along very shortly.”  The S&P/TSX completed its first series of four straight
weekly gains since September 2009. The Canadian benchmark has
increased  3.6 percent  during its streak, led by raw-materials
companies, as the U.S. dollar has dropped on concerns new
stimulus measures will weaken the currency.  Grains Soar  The U.S. reduced its  corn-harvest estimate  by 3.8 percent
from last month’s forecast, citing flooding in June and hot, dry
Midwest weather in August. Corn futures for December delivery
soared 6 percent, the most allowed on the Chicago Board of
Trade, while wheat jumped the maximum 9.1 percent after the U.S.
cut its world inventory estimate.  Agrium, which is also a retail supplier of fertilizer,

market value, increased 2.8 percent to C$147.50. Viterra Inc.,
Canada’s largest grain handler, climbed 4.3 percent to C$9.45.  Prices of energy and raw materials also gained as investors
bet the U.S. employment data will help convince the Fed to begin
a new round of asset purchases.  U.S. non-farm payrolls dropped by 95,000 in September, the
Labor Department said today in Washington. Economists had
forecast a decline of 5,000 jobs, according to the median of 87

to C$49.98 after the United Arab Emirates said BlackBerry
services now comply with the country’s security requirements.
The country had planned to ban BlackBerry communication on Oct.
11 had it not come to an agreement with the Waterloo, Ontario,
company.  Jazz Air Income Fund, the regional carrier that flies on
