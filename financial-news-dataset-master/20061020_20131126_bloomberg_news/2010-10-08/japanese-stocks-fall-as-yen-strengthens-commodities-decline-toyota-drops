Japanese  stocks  fell, sending the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average lower for a second day, as carmakers
dropped after the yen reached a 15-year high against the dollar,
dimming the earnings outlook for exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest automaker, dropped
2 percent. Canon Inc., the world’s No. 1 camera maker, slid 1.2
percent. Tokyo Electron Ltd., which makes electronic components,
fell 2 percent.  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. , Japan’s second-
biggest oil driller, lost 0.9 percent after crude oil decreased
yesterday.  Seven & I Holdings Co. , the operator of the 7-Eleven
chain of convenience stores, slumped 3.7 percent after cutting
its full-year sales forecast.  “People are concerned about whether companies will start
making downward revisions because of the yen,” said  Naoteru Teraoka , general manager at the investment unit of Tokyo-based
Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees about $26
billion. “It’s tough for investors to have an optimistic view
of developed markets at the moment.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 1 percent to 9,588.88 at
the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index lost 0.8
percent to 839.44. About twice as many stocks fell as advanced.
The Nikkei gained 2 percent this week, while the Topix rose 1.1
percent. Both gauges had the first weekly climb in three weeks.  The Topix has dropped 16 percent from its high this year on
April 15 as Europe’s debt crisis, China’s steps to curb property
prices and concern about the pace of U.S. economic growth
weakened confidence in a global recovery. Stocks in the index
trade at 15 times estimated earnings on average, compared with
13.8 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 and 12.1 times for the
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  Toyota Drops  Toyota fell 1.2 percent to 2,895 yen. Isuzu Motors Ltd.,
which gets about 60 percent of its revenue overseas, decreased
2.7 percent to 324 yen. A measure of automakers was the biggest
drag on the Topix.  Canon retreated 1.2 percent to 3,830 yen. Tokyo Electron
fell 2 percent to 4,575 yen.  Fanuc Ltd. , an industrial robot maker, sank 1.8 percent to
10,650 yen, the second-heaviest drag on the Nikkei 225. The
company had its rating reduced to “neutral” from
“outperform” at Macquarie Group Ltd.  The yen strengthened to as much as 82.11 against the dollar
at about 10 p.m. yesterday in Tokyo from 82.86 at the 3 p.m.
close of stock trading. That’s the strongest level since May
1995 and compares with the 82.88 reached on Sept. 15, the day
Japan’s government said it intervened in the foreign-exchange
market to weaken the currency for the first time since 2004.  Crude Oil  A stronger yen cuts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. , Japan’s second-biggest oil
driller, lost 1.2 percent to 3,240 yen. JX Holdings Inc, Japan’s
largest refiner, fell 1 percent to 491 yen.  Crude oil for November delivery fell 1.9 percent to $81.67
a barrel yesterday, retreating from a five-month high.  “Commodities have been rising for a while, and they’re
probably entering a correction phase now,” said Chuo Mitsui’s
Teraoka.  Seven & I sank 3.7 percent to 1,975 yen after first-half
net income increased 43 percent from a year earlier to 62.4
billion yen ($758 million). The company cut its full-year sales
projection to 5.14 trillion yen from 5.2 trillion yen.  Koito Manufacturing Co. , a maker of parts for cars and
airplanes, plunged 16 percent to 1,047 yen, its biggest drop
since March 1992, after the Bangkok Post reported a subsidiary
will be sued by Thai Airways International Pcl for $550 million
over the late delivery of airplane seats. Koito had the second-
sharpest decline on the Topix.  Among shares that rose,  Panasonic Corp. , the world’s
biggest maker of plasma televisions, climbed 3.4 percent to
1,176 yen. The company announced that it withdrew its
registration for a new share sale worth as much as 500 billion
yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
