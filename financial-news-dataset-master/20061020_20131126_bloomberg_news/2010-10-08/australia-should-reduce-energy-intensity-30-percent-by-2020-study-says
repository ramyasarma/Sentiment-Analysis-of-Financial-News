Australia should target a 30 percent
improvement in energy intensity by 2020, according to a
government report released today by Prime Minister Julia
Gillard’s Task Group on Energy Efficiency.  The study reinforces the government’s climate change
strategy and the need for a price on carbon, Gillard said in a
statement.  The report notes that “by far the most important element
in a vision of a step change in Australia’s energy efficiency
improvement is the presence of an explicit price on carbon,”
according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
