Investors should sell the Australian
dollar against the Canadian dollar, according to Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank.  The so-called Aussie should be sold at 0.9908 Canadian
dollars with the expectation it drops to 0.9673, London-based
deputy head of foreign-exchange strategy Daragh Maher wrote in a
research report today.  “Aussie/CAD has overshot relative to interest rate spreads
and is also looking very expensive relative to trend,” Maher
wrote. “Our CADITs tool has generated a ‘sell’ signal on the
cross this morning.”  The Aussie fell 0.8 percent to 0.9914 as of 11:55 a.m. in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
