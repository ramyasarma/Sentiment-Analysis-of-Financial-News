Global wheat inventories will be
smaller than forecast a month ago because of lower U.S.
production, the Department of Agriculture said. Grain futures in
Chicago surged 9.1 percent.  Stockpiles will total 174.66 million metric tons on May 31,
down 1.8 percent from 177.79 million estimated last month, the
USDA said today in a report. The average estimate of 13 analysts
in a Bloomberg News survey was 177.43 million. Unsold U.S.
supplies may fall 5.4 percent to 853 million bushels (23.22
million tons), from 902 million bushels estimated in September,
the agency said.  U.S. production was projected at 2.224 billion bushels,
down 1.8 percent from the September estimate and up 0.3 percent
from last year. The USDA also lowered its inventory estimates
for the European Union and Canada.  “All commodities are going to be fighting for acreage in
the coming season,” said  Parker McMahan , a senior account
executive at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “Profits to the
farmer will be paramount.”  Wheat Surges  Wheat futures for December delivery surged 60 cents, the
exchange limit, or 9.1 percent, to settle at $7.1925 a bushel at
1 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The most-active contract
has jumped 50 percent since the end of June, after drought
ruined fields in Russia, and floods harmed crops in Canada.  Corn and soybean futures also jumped the limits set by the
CBOT. The USDA cut its corn-crop estimate for the second time in
as many months, predicting a 3.4 percent decline from last year.
U.S. farmers may collect 2.2 percent fewer soybeans than
estimated a month ago.  “Corn is in the driver’s seat now, and your beans and your
wheat are all going to follow,” said  Jason Britt , an analyst at
brokerage Central States Commodities Inc. in Kansas City,
Missouri. “I’d hate to say we’re starting an acreage battle on
Oct. 8, but you can make an argument for that.”  Global livestock-feed use will rise to 121.05 million tons,
up 1.9 percent from last month’s forecast. In the U.S., feed-
wheat use may climb to 4.9 million tons, or 5.8 percent more
than estimated last month.  World wheat production may total 641.44 million tons, down
from 643.01 million tons forecast in September, the USDA said.  Russian Output  Wheat production in Russia, once the world’s third-largest
exporter, may total 42.5 million tons, the USDA said. That’s
unchanged last month’s forecast and 31 percent lower than the
61.7 million produced last year.  Russia halted grain exports in August after the worst
drought in 50 years curbed output. Production forecasts by the
USDA for Ukraine and Kazakhstan also were unchanged from last
month.  “The decline in the world production has already been well
documented by the trade and by the government,” said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst with Prime Agricultural Consultants
Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  The U.S. is the world’s largest wheat exporter and ranks
third in production, behind China and India.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
