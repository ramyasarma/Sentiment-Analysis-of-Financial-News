Commonwealth Games Federation chief
Michael Fennell said that tests on the three swimming pools
being used in New Delhi showed no problems with water quality.  Tests were carried out at the games village, practice and
competition pools, he said. Australia and England are the only
teams to have reported illness among their swimmers, Fennell
said, adding that doctors agreed the problem was not likely
linked to the pool.  To contact the reporter on this story:
