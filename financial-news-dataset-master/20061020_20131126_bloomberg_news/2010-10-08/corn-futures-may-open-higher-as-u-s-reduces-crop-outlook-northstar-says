Corn futures may open 20 cents to 25
cents a bushel higher after the government cut its estimate of
the U.S. harvest, said Mark Schultz, the chief analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  Production will total 12.664 billion bushels, down from
13.16 billion projected a month ago and less than last year’s
record 13.11 billion, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today in a report. The average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News was for 12.977 billion bushels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
