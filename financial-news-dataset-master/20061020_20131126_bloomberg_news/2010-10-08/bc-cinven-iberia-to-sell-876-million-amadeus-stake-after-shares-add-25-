Amadeus IT Holding SA  shareholders
raised 617 million euros ($858 million) by selling a stake in
the flight-reservations provider after the stock gained more
than 25 percent since its  initial public offering  in April.  Private-equity firms BC Partners Ltd. and Cinven Ltd. each
sold 4.4 percent of Amadeus, cutting their respective holdings
to 13 percent, the company said in a filing. Spanish airline
Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA sold another 1.5 percent
stake, reducing its holding to 7.5 percent. The shares went for
13.5 euros each, 2.7 percent less than yesterday’s close.  The two London-based private equity funds led the 4.34
billion-euro leveraged-buyout of Amadeus in 2005. The firms took
the Madrid-based company public in April this year in an IPO
that raised 1.3 billion euros for its shareholders. Paris-based
Air France-KLM Group and  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  of Cologne also
hold minority stakes and sold stock in the April offering.  The  shares  fell 2.9 percent today to 13.475 euros at close
trading in Madrid. They were sold to the public for 11 euros
each in April. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and Morgan Stanley arranged the sale.  Latest Holdings  Following today’s transactions Air France, which didn’t
take part, becomes Amadeus’s biggest shareholder, with a 15.22
percent stake. Cinven and BC rank next, followed on 7.61
percent by Lufthansa, which also retained its full holding.  While Iberia sold stock today, it didn’t participate in
the April IPO. The free float in Amadeus has increased from 
31.92 percent of the total shares to 42.14 percent, Malek
Nejjai, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail.  Leveraged buyout firms such as BC Partners and Cinven
typically use loans secured on the targets they acquire to
finance about two-thirds of the purchase price, and cash from
their own funds for the rest. The firms seek to improve
performance at the companies they acquire or expand them before
selling them within about five years.  Cinven has reaped more than three times its original
investment in Amadeus, the fund said in a separate statement
today. The firm will keep a 13 percent stake in Amadeus and has
agreed not to sell any more stock for 90 days as part of a lock-
up agreement between the shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
