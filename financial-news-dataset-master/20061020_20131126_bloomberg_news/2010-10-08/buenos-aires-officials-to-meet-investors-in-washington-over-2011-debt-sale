Officials from the  city of Buenos
Aires  will meet with investors in Washington this weekend to
discuss a possible bond sale to finance the 2011 budget, said
 Abel Fernandez , the city’s director of public credit.  Argentina’s capital city seeks to tap international credit
markets with bonds that mature in 7 to 10 years to help pay
$350 million in debt and cover $150 million in infrastructure
projects, Fernandez said in a telephone interview. He plans to
meet with representatives of 10 investment banks on the
sidelines of the annual meetings of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank.  “We’re looking to make progress in our effort to tap
international capital markets and see what our best option is to
minimize the interest rate and maximize the maturity,”
Fernandez said. “We have time, we don’t need to sell more debt
in 2010 because we have our needs covered.”  Buenos Aires Mayor  Mauricio Macri , who said in an Oct. 6
interview that he will be a candidate for president of Argentina
next year, will use the funds to expand the city’s subway line,
improve wastewater treatment and upgrade schools and hospitals,
Fernandez said. Any new bond sale must be approved by the city’s
legislature, Fernandez said.  Buenos Aires sold $475 million of five-year bonds in March
to yield 12.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s 360 basis points, or 3.6 percentage points, above the 8.9
percent yield on Argentina’s 7 percent bonds due in March 2015,
according to pricing calculated by Bloomberg.  The province of Buenos Aires, which surrounds the capital
but has its own government, last month sold $550 million of
five-year notes to yield 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
