Morgan Stanley recommended buying
Spanish, Italian and French government bonds, while staying
short Irish and Portuguese debt.  “Two-way risk has returned to peripherals spreads, in our
view, prompting us to recommend a tactical reduction in
underweights,” Laurence Mutkin , a managing director at Morgan
Stanley & Co. International in London. “There are now
significant risks to being underweight Spain, Italy and
France, because of their yields, volatilities and weights in the
index.”  Investors should maintain, but reduce, underweights in
Ireland and Portugal, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
