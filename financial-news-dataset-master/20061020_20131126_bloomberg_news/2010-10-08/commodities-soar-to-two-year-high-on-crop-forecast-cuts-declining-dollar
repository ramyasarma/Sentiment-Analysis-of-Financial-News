Commodity prices surged to the
highest level in almost two years after the U.S. government cut
its crop-supply forecasts and the dollar slumped on speculation
the Federal Reserve will buy more debt to revive the economy.  The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19  raw materials  jumped
as much as 2.7 percent to 295.17, the highest level since Oct.
15, 2008. Every price advanced. Wheat, soybeans and corn led the
gains, each jumping the most allowed by the Chicago Board of
Trade. Copper climbed to a 27-month high, and crude oil topped
$83 a barrel.  Since the end of May, the CRB index has rallied 16 percent,
and the dollar slid 11 percent against a basket of six major
currencies, as the U.S. sought to inject more cash into the
economy and spur growth. Today, the  greenback  dropped below 82
yen for the first time in 15 years as a U.S. payrolls report
showed employers cut more jobs last month than economists
forecast.  “Everybody is printing more money except emerging markets,
and those guys are buying commodities,” said  Michael K. Smith ,
the president of T&K Futures & Options in Port St. Lucie,
Florida. “We’re going to have an inflationary spike. This is a
perfect storm for commodities going higher.”  The CRB index rose 7.81 to close at 295.11 at 5:10 p.m. New
York time. This week, the gauge gained 3.3 percent, the most
since April 2.  Crop Forecasts Cut  The U.S. Department of Agriculture today cut its domestic
corn-crop estimate for the second time in as many months,
predicting a 3.4 percent drop from last year. While farmers will
collect the most soybeans ever, the total will be 2.2 percent
less than forecast in September, the agency said. Global wheat
inventories will be 1.8 percent less than projected last month.  “The government has shocked the grain industry with the
huge cut in U.S. production,” said  David Smoldt , the vice
president of operations for FCStone LLC in West Des Moines.
“There will be some scrambling for supplies today.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose the 30 cents, or 6
percent, to close $5.2825 a bushel. Soybean futures for November
delivery soared 70 cents, or 6.6 percent, to $11.35 a bushel.
Wheat futures for December delivery jumped 60 cents, or 9.1
percent, to $7.1925 a bushel.  Reduced supplies of corn may increase costs for meat
companies and squeeze margins for makers of grain-based ethanol
such as Valero Energy Corp., Poet LLC and  Archer Daniels Midland
Co.   The shares of  Tyson Foods Inc ., the largest chicken
processor, slid $1.26, or 7.7 percent, to $15.01 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier, they touched $14.82,
an eight-month low.  Smithfield Foods Inc. , the biggest pork
producer, fell $1.08, or 6.7 percent, to $14.97, the biggest
drop in a year.  Freeport Climbs  Copper futures for December delivery increased 9.5 cents,
or 2.6 percent, to close at $3.7745 a pound. Earlier, the price
reached $3.8015, the highest level for a most-active contract
since July 8, 2008.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. , the world’s biggest
publicly listed copper producer, climbed $4.11, or 4.5 percent,
to $95.51. Earlier, the shares reached $95.91, the highest level
since Aug. 1, 2008.  Crude-oil futures for November delivery rose 99 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $82.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $83.13.  Sugar rose to the highest price in almost eight months on
concern that demand will outstrip supplies after adverse weather
damaged crops in Brazil, the biggest producer.  Cotton futures jumped to a 15-year high after the USDA
boosted a forecast for global demand. Textile mills will use
120.8 million bales in the year that began Aug. 1, up 0.2
percent from last month’s estimate, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on the story:
