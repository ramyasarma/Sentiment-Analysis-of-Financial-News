The YM Uranus, a chemical tanker that
took on water off northwestern France, will be towed to port,
France’s maritime agency for the Atlantic Ocean said.  “The ship is about to be towed and teams on board have
started” removing water from the vessel, Magali Chaillou, a
spokeswoman for the Prefecture Maritime, said by phone. Towing
lines have been attached and the operation should start shortly,
she said at 10:50 a.m. London time. The exact cargo and its risk
to the environment are being investigated, she added.  The 120-meter (390-foot) tanker was abandoned by its crew
following a probable collision with a cargo ship, the agency
said.  The crew sent an alert at 5:30 a.m. Paris time and were
rescued by helicopter from a life raft, the Prefecture Maritime
said in a  report  on its website. The ship was 50 miles (80
kilometers) southwest of the island of Ouessant, which is on the
tip of northwestern France.  The Malta-flagged YM Uranus, built in 2009, was traveling
from Porto Marghera in Italy to Amsterdam and carrying 6,000
metric tons of solvent, the agency said. It probably collided
with the bulk carrier Hanjin Rizhao. That vessel is 292 meters
long and was built this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
