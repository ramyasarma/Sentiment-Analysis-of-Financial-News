Canadian employers unexpectedly cut
positions in September, and the unemployment rate fell as people
left the workforce.  Employment  fell by 6,600 jobs, the second drop in the past
nine months, following a gain of 35,800 in August, Statistics
Canada said today in Ottawa. The  jobless rate  declined to 8
percent from 8.1 percent as 24,400 people stopped looking for
work. Economists  forecast  job growth of 10,000 and an
unemployment rate of 8.1 percent, according to the median
estimates of 17 economists in Bloomberg surveys.  The slowing labor market may give the Bank of Canada more
scope to keep interest rates unchanged at its next policy
announcement on Oct. 19. The central bank raised its  benchmark
interest rate  to 1 percent last month and said it expected a
more gradual recovery in  economic growth . Employment gains
averaged 6,600 over the past three months, down from the 75,530
average in the previous quarter.  “The headline was weaker than expected, but there were
some bright spots -- it wasn’t all gloom and doom,” said  Rudy Narvas , a senior economist with Societe Generale SA in New York,
pointing to an increase in full-time jobs. “As a whole, the
report is a wash for the Bank of Canada -- it doesn’t really
push the central bank to increase rates.”  Narvas said he expects the central bank to stand pat at the
next decision.  Modest Growth  Canada’s dollar, which initially weakened after the
Canadian report, recouped losses following the U.S. employment
release. The currency strengthened 0.1 percent to C$1.0167 per
U.S. dollar at 8:35 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0174
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 98.36 U.S. cents.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said last week in St.
Catharines, Ontario he expects “modest” third quarter economic
growth and that the unemployment rate is still too high.  Full-time  employment rose by 37,100 positions in September,
which was more than offset by a drop of 43,700 part-time jobs.  “Conversion of part-time to full-time jobs is a mild
positive buried beneath the headline as it expands hours worked,
and full-time jobs are generally better paying and more
stable,”  Derek Holt , vice-president of economics at Bank of
Nova Scotia’s capital markets unit in Toronto, said in a note to
clients. “On balance, the details to this report are more
encouraging than the mild headline drop.”  Report Details  Payroll employment  advanced  by 11,800 positions in
September, and self-employment fell by 18,400, the agency said.
Governments hired 6,500 workers and private firms added 5,300
jobs. Canada’s economy has created 349,000 jobs since September
2009, the report said, an increase of 2.1 percent.  Employment in the professional, scientific and technical
services category fell by 31,900 positions, while educational
services declined by 9,800 positions after rising by 68,400
positions in August.  Transportation and warehousing companies created 15,000
jobs in September, Statistics Canada said. Manufacturing
companies added 8,200 jobs in September.  Best Buy Co., the world’s largest consumer-electronics
retailer,  said this week  its 146 Future Shop stores will hire
4,000 people across Canada for the holiday shopping season to
supplement its current 10,000 employees.  The International Monetary Fund predicted this week that
Canada’s unemployment rate will fall to 7.5 percent next year,
compared with the 6.2 percent rate seen before the recession in
September 2008.  Average hourly wages rose 2.3 percent in September from a
year earlier, Statistics Canada said in the report, the same
pace as in August.  The U.S. also lost more jobs than forecast in September, as
employers cut staffing by 95,000 workers after a revised 57,000
decrease in August, Labor Department figures in Washington
showed today. The median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 5,000 drop and the unemployment rate
unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
