Elpida Memory Inc. fell the most in
more than a month in early Tokyo trading after the Nikkei
newspaper said the Japanese chipmaker may sell 60 billion yen
($728 million) in convertible bonds.   The shares dropped as much as 5.6 percent to 842 yen as of
9:15 local time on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest decline
since Aug. 31.   Elpida said in a statement to the exchange that is wasn’t
the source of the report.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
