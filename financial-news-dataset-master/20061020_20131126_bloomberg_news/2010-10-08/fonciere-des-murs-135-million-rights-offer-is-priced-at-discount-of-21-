Fonciere des Murs said it will seek
to raise 97 million euros in a rights offer priced at 15 euros a
share.  Existing shareholders can buy 13 new shares for every 100
held, the company said in a statement on the Les Echos website.
That’s a discount of 21 percent to yesterday’s closing price of
18.93 euros, Bloomberg calculations show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
