Allied Irish Banks  Plc’s long-term
credit rating was cut to BBB+ from A- by Standard & Poor’s,
which said Ireland’s second-largest lender will be dependent on
central bank funding for the “foreseeable” future.  S&P has a “negative” outlook on Dublin-based Allied Irish
because of the “downside risk” to the recovery of the bank’s
earnings and uncertainty over its plan to sell assets, the
ratings company said in a statement today.  Ireland’s banks are raising capital after bad debts surged
amid the collapse of a decade-long real estate boom, prompting a
bailout of the industry that may cost as much as 50 billion
euros ($70 billion). Irish-based financial firms had borrowed
119.1 billion euros from the European Central Bank as of Sept.
24, a 25 percent increase on the previous month.  The government said on Sept. 30 it would take majority
ownership of Allied Irish, which has been directed by the
nation’s financial regulator to raise 10.4 billion euros by
year-end to meet new capital standards. In the past month, the
lender agreed to sell stakes in its Polish unit, Bank Zachodni
WBK SA, and U.S. lender  M&T Bank Corp.  The bank has also put its
U.K. unit up for sale.  Allied Irish shares fell 2.9 percent to 39.5 euro cents at
the 5:10 p.m. close of trading in Dublin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
