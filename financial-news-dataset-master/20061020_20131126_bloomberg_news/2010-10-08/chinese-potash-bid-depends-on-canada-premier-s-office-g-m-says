China’s Sinochem Group won’t proceed
with its bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. without a
“positive signal” from the office of Canadian Prime Minister 
Stephen Harper that its offer will be fairly considered, the
Globe & Mail reported, citing unidentified people close to
Sinochem.  Sinochem is willing to make large concessions to the
federal and Saskatchewan governments to allay concern about
ownership of Potash passing to a Chinese state-owned company,
the newspaper said.  These include a “golden share” in Potash giving the
Canadian government a veto over any substantial changes to the
company, and Sinochem would promise to go on selling Potash’s
output to China through the Canadian company’s Canpotex unit,
the Globe & Mail said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
