The U.S. has expected that  Kim Jong Il ’s son will eventually succeed him as the leader of North
Korea, Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  said today.  North Korea officials have confirmed for the first time
that  Kim Jong Un , is his father’s heir apparent, the Associated
Press Television News reported, citing an interview with
Politburo member  Yang Hyong Sop .  Kim Jong Un, who South Korean officials say is in his late
20s, was elected to the ruling party’s No. 2 military post at a
meeting on Sept. 28. His appointment, a day after he was made a
four-star general, was an indication his father planned to
extend his family’s rule, which began with North Korea’s
founder,  Kim Il Sung .  “We’ve been seeing signs for quite a long time that the
succession was moving in this direction,” Gates said at a joint
press conference with South Korean Minister of National Defense
Kim Tae-young at the Pentagon. The minister is participating in
annual defense talks.  “There clearly were some steps taken at the party meeting,
in terms of new appointments for him,” said Gates, referring to
the younger Kim. “I’m not aware there has been any further
formal indication that he will be the successor but, frankly,
that’s the assumption we are all working under -- that he will
in fact take on that leadership role,” Gates said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
