Grain and oilseed prices rose the
most allowed by the Chicago Board of Trade after the U.S.
government said supplies will be smaller than forecast last
month, increasing the cost of producing food and fuel.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its domestic  corn-
crop estimate  for the second time in as many months, predicting
a 3.4 percent drop from last year. While farmers will collect
the most soybeans ever, the total will be 2.2 percent less than
forecast in September, the USDA said. Global wheat inventories
will be 1.8 percent less than projected last month.  Corn prices are near the highest level in two years, after
surging 41 percent since June, as unfavorable weather hurt crops
in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and exporter. The jump
in feed costs today sent shares of Tyson Foods Inc., the largest
U.S. chicken processor, to its biggest drop since July 2009 and
revived concern that food inflation will accelerate.  “People have not come to grips with the rising cost of
producing food,” said  Michael Swanson , a senior agricultural
economist at Minneapolis-based Wells Fargo & Co., the largest
U.S. farm lender. “Feed costs are going to balloon” for
livestock, dairy and poultry producers, he said.  Meat and dairy producers may lose money if they haven’t
already secured feed, Swanson said. Some hog producers may get
80 cents for a pound of pork that was produced with a $1 of
corn, encouraging reductions in the herd, he said.  Compounding tight feed supplies for domestic buyers is the
slumping dollar, which makes commodities cheaper for importers
using other currencies, Swanson said. The dollar dropped below
82 yen for the first time in 15 years on concern the economic
recovery is stalling.  Tyson, Smithfield  Tyson Foods , based in Springdale, Arkansas, fell $1.27, or
7.8 percent, to $15 at 2:18 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
A close at that price would be the biggest decline since July
20, 2009.  Smithfield Foods Inc. , the largest pork processor,
dropped 83 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $15.22, heading for the
largest slump since July 16.  The cost of meat and dairy products will rise faster than
the overall pace of food inflation next year, the USDA said on
Sept. 24. Meat costs will rise 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent, while
dairy gains 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent.  Total food costs  will
increase 2 percent to 3 percent, up from 0.5 percent to 1.5
percent this year, the USDA said.  Higher fuel prices and government subsidies will help
ethanol producers cope with the higher cost of corn. Ethanol
futures surged as much as 9.3 percent today, the most in five
years. Gasoline prices have risen 13 percent since the end of
August, while corn rallied 20 percent.  Price Limit  Corn futures for December delivery rose the 30-cent trading
limit, or 6 percent, to $5.2825 a bushel as of the 1:15 p.m.
close on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price reached a two-
year high of $5.2875 on Sept. 27.  “Corn-demand rationing will occur for most sectors between
$5.50 and $5.75 a bushel,”  Alexander Bos , a grain analyst for
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in London, said in a report to clients
today. “Corn prices may “trade above $6 bushel within the next
few weeks,” he said.  U.S. farmers will harvest 12.664 billion bushels of corn,
down from 13.16 billion projected a month ago and less than last
year’s record 13.11 billion, the USDA said today in a report.
The average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
was for 12.977 billion bushels. Flooding in June and hot, dry
weather in August cut Midwest yields.  “The government has shocked the grain industry with the
huge cut in U.S. production,” said  David Smoldt , the vice
president of operations for FCStone LLC in West Des Moines,
Iowa. “There will be some scrambling for supplies today.”  Smaller Inventories  Unsold U.S. supplies on Sept. 1, before next year’s
harvest, will total 902 million bushels, compared with the
month-ago forecast of 1.116 billion and 1.708 billion this year,
the USDA said. Supplies will be the lowest since 1997.  “We will not produce enough to meet demand from domestic
livestock producers, ethanol makers and overseas buyers,”  Alan Brugler , the president of Brugler Marketing & Management Inc. in
Omaha, Nebraska, said before the report. “We are going to run
up the price to slow demand and encourage farmers to plant more
next year.”  The U.S.  soybean crop  will be a record 3.408 billion
bushels (92.8 million metric tons), compared with 3.483 billion
projected in September and 3.359 billion gathered last year, the
USDA said. August rains failed to boost yields, and the
government reduced its acreage estimates. Analysts in the
Bloomberg survey expected 3.501 billion bushels.  Soybean Prices  Soybean futures for November delivery soared the 70-cent
trading limit, or 6.6 percent, to $11.35 a bushel in Chicago.
The oilseed, used to make livestock feed and vegetable oil, has
gained 26 percent since the end of June.  “The USDA surprised the trade with a cut in U.S. soybean
yields and an unexpectedly large cut in planted acreage,”
FCStone’s Smoldt said. “There are just too many uncertainties
about global supplies” with dry weather already delaying
planting in parts of South America, he said.  Global wheat stockpiles will total 174.66 million metric
tons on May 31, down 1.8 percent from 177.79 million estimated
last month, the USDA said. The average estimate of 13 analysts
in a Bloomberg News survey was 177.43 million tons.  Unsold supplies in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter,
may fall 5.4 percent to 853 million bushels (23.22 million
tons), from 902 million bushels estimated in September, the
department said. U.S. production was projected at 2.224 billion
bushels, down 1.8 percent from the September estimate while up
0.3 percent from last year. The USDA also lowered its inventory
estimates for the European Union and Canada.  Wheat Surges  Wheat futures for December gained the 60-cent limit, or 9.1
percent, to $7.1925 a bushel on the CBOT and are up 52 percent
the past year, after drought ruined fields in Russia and too
much rain diminished supplies from Canada.  “Possibly, there will be some switching from corn to
wheat” in feed rations, said  Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler
Commodities LLC in Augusta, Kansas. “The biggest thing is, end-
users beware, because quite honestly, they’re screwed. Talk of
$6 corn is very, very possible now.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
