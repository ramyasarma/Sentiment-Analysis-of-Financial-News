Returns for investors in Germany’s
power grid are attractive and don’t need to increase,
Handelsblatt reported, citing an interview with  Matthias Kurth ,
head of Germany’s Federal Network Agency regulator.  Power-grid operators have been speculating that the
government’s energy strategy, which calls for investment into
the expansion of the country’s grid, would prompt the agency to
let returns rise, the newspaper  said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
