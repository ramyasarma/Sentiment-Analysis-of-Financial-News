U.S. stock-index futures erased
losses, the dollar weakened below 82 yen for the first time
since 1995 and Treasuries reversed declines as a bigger-than-
forecast decrease in jobs fueled speculation the Federal Reserve
will undertake more economic stimulus.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  expiring in
December were little changed at 1,156.5 at 8:40 a.m. in New York
after declining almost 1 percent earlier. The dollar weakened as
much as 0.6 percent to 81.95 yen and the yield on the 10-year
Treasury slipped 1 basis point to 2.37 percent after climbing 4
basis points earlier.  Employers cut staffing by 95,000 workers after a revised
57,000 decrease in August, Labor Department figures in
Washington showed today. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 5,000 drop. The
unemployment rate unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent.  The jobs report is a “strong signal” that the Fed will
increase asset purchases,  Bill Gross , co-chief investment
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the
world’s largest bond fund in Newport Beach, California, said in
a Bloomberg Radio interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
