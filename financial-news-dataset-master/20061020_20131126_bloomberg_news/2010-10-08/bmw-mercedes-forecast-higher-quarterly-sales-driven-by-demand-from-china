Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and
Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, the two biggest makers of luxury
vehicles, projected higher fourth-quarter sales on surging
demand in China.  BMW, the luxury leader, today forecast a “double-digit”
percentage rise in fourth-quarter deliveries after overhauling
the 5-Series sedan and wagon.  Mercedes  said it was “very
confident” about continuing growth in the final three months
after a record September, when the manufacturer introduced
updated CL- and R-Class models.  “We have exceptional new products and intend to maintain
this upward trend,”  Ian Robertson , sales chief at Munich-based
BMW, said in an e-mailed statement. “We expect to see robust
growth in the double-digit percentage range.”  Luxury-car sales are rebounding from the financial crisis,
when wealthy consumers held back on flashy purchases. BMW and
Stuttgart, Germany-based Mercedes are both targeting 10 percent
sales increases this year.  Volkswagen AG ’s Audi forecasts record
sales in 2010, boosted by the new A1 subcompact.  “This new volume model will give us extra momentum in
Europe in the fourth quarter,”  Peter Schwarzenbauer , Audi’s
head of sales, said in a statement yesterday, adding that A1
capacity was increased 20 percent for 2011.  Audi, which aims to topple BMW has the luxury leader by
2015, increased deliveries by 16 percent in September to 102,650
vehicles. BMW sales last month rose 17 percent to 142,950 cars
and SUVs, while Mercedes posted a 13 percent gain to 118,600
vehicles. The booming Chinese economy is fueling demand.  Positive Development  “We expect sales to increase particularly rapidly in Asia,
especially in China, and the other BRIC countries,”  Joachim Schmidt , Mercedes’ top salesman, said in a statement. “The
positive development of the past several months makes us very
confident for the fourth quarter in which we will continue to
increase our sales.”  Mercedes’ sales surged 98 percent in China to 13,500
vehicles in September. BMW deliveries jumped 89 percent to
15,379, while Audi, the luxury leader in China, posted a 45
percent gain to 22,125 autos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
