Brazil’s real is headed to its eighth
straight weekly gain, its longest winning streak in six years,
as a tax increase on foreigners’ purchases of fixed-income
assets failed to slow investment in the country.  The real advanced 1.2 percent to 1.6705 per dollar at 12:57
p.m. New York time, from 1.6897 on Oct. 1. The currency
strengthened 0.6 percent today. The real gained for eight
straight weeks during the period ended Sept. 17, 2004.  Brazil’s real surged 2.1 percent on Oct. 5, even after the
government announced it was doubling the so-called IOF tax on
foreign investment in fixed-income securities to 4 percent to
stem the currency’s appreciation. The effort was overshadowed by
a Japanese interest-rate cut.  “You have this massive rate differential between developed
markets and emerging markets, and that’s creating a world where
the search for yield is a force that has to be reckoned with,”
said  Vitali Meschoulam , head of Latin America strategy at Morgan
Stanley in New York, in a telephone interview. “It explains why
it’s so difficult for the Brazilian central bank to fight
against the liquidity that we’re seeing.”  Brazilian central bank President  Henrique Meirelles  said
today in Washington that monetary policies carried out by rich
nations such as the U.S. are creating “excessive” inflows to
emerging economies, including Brazil, that can lead to the
formation of “bubbles.”  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
11.37 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
