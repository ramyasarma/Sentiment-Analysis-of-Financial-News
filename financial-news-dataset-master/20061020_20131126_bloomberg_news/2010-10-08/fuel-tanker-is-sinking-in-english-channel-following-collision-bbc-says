A fuel tanker is sinking in the
English Channel after colliding with a container ship, the
British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  The YM Uranus was carrying a cargo of heavy Pygas, a sort
of gasoline, when it struck a Panamanian bulk container 160
kilometers off the Brittany coast, the BBC said. The crew were
all safely evacuated, the news service said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
