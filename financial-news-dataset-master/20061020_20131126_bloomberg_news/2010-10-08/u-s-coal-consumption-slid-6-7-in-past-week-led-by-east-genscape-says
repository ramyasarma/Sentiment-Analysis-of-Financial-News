U.S. coal consumption tumbled 6.7
percent in the week ended yesterday from the previous seven-day
period, led by a decline in the East, according to an analysis
by  Genscape Inc.   Power-plant use in the East plummeted 7.6 percent while
consumption in the West dropped 4.9 percent, the data provider
said. Overall coal demand was down 3.3 percent from a year
earlier.  Genscape says it monitors coal use in real time at U.S.
power producers with a device that’s installed at the plants.
The company uses different models to reach its consumption
figures, making it possible for regional data to conflict with
national totals.  The U.S., which holds the world’s largest reserves of coal,
relies on the fuel for about half of its power generation,
compared with about 20 percent for natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
