A flute concerto by baroque composer
Antonio Vivaldi, missing since the middle of the 18th century,
has been discovered in a Scottish aristocrat’s papers by a
researcher, the Daily Telegraph reported.  The manuscript for Il Gran Mogol, one of a quartet of
concertos whose whereabouts were unknown, was discovered in the
papers of the Marquesses of Lothian, and Lord Robert Kerr, a son
of the third marquis, is known to have studied the flute at the
University of Edinburgh, the newspaper said.  He was killed at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, fighting
for the British government forces against the Jacobite rebels
fighting to restore the House of Stuart to the throne.  The work is to be given its first public performance since
the 18th century in Perth, Scotland on Jan. 26, the Telegraph
added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
