Uganda ’s parliament amended the
Income Tax Act to provide for revenue earned by oil exploration
companies,  New Vision  reported, citing Minister of State for
Finance Aston Kajara.  The amendment provides for the calculation of withholding
tax in petroleum agreements and the filing of quarterly and
annual oil-revenue returns, the Kampala-based newspaper
reported. Pre-production oil activities, including the
transferring of exploration interests, will be taxed under the
new law, the paper said, citing Frank Tumwebaze, a lawmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
