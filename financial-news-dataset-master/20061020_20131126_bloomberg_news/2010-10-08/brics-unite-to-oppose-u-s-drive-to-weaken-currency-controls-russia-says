Russian Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said it’s premature for the world’s financial leaders to
agree on a currency accord.  “In my view it’s too early to make a decision regarding
currency exchange rates,” Kudrin told reporters in Washington.
“Such measures aren’t yet sufficiently formulated.”  The BRIC countries are united in opposing U.S. efforts to
weaken or eliminate mechanisms to control currency fluctuations,
Russia’s Finance Ministry earlier said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
