Soybeans will open higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade after the government cut its forecast of
the U.S. harvest, according to analysts at Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. and ABN Amro Clearing LLC.  Soybeans may open 20 cents to 25 cents a bushel higher,
Mark Schultz, Northstar’s chief analyst, said from Minneapolis.
Charles Sernatinger, a vice president at ABN Amro in Chicago,
forecast a rise of 40 cents to 50 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
