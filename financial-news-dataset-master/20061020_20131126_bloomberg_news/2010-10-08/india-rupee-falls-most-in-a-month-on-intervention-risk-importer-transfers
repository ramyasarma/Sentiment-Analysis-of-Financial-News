India’s rupee fell the most in a
month on concern importers will step up dollar purchases and the
central bank may intervene following a rally that’s made the
currency Asia’s best performer of the past month.  The rupee completed a sixth weekly gain and yesterday
climbed to a two-year high as exchange data showed global funds
pumped a record $21 billion into Indian stocks this year.
Central bank Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  said this week policy
makers are monitoring capital flows and will “respond” if the
exchange rate is affected. A stronger rupee erodes the value of
Indian exporters’ overseas income.  The currency weakened on “the risk of Reserve Bank of
India intervention and importers covering their near-term”
dollar payments, J.  Moses Harding , a Mumbai-based executive vice
president at IndusInd Bank Ltd., wrote in a research note today.  The rupee declined 0.5 percent today to 44.4350 per dollar
as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, paring its advance this week
to 0.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has
surged 5 percent in the past month, the best performance among
the 10 most-traded Asian currencies, and touched 44.115
yesterday, the strongest level since September 2008.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.97 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 44.75
yesterday and 45.09 at the end of last week. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
