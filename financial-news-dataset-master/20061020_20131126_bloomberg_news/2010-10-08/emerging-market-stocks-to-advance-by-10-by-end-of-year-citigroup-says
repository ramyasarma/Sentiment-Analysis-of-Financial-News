Emerging-market equities will advance
as much as 10 percent by year-end, driven by “strong” economic
growth, low interest rates in the developed world and
“attractive” valuations, according to Citigroup Inc.  The long-term outlook for developing-nation stocks is
“very constructive,” Citigroup strategists led by Geoffrey
Dennis wrote in a research note dated yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
