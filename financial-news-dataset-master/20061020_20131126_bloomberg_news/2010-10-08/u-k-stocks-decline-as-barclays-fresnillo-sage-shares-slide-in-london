U.K. stocks  ended the week little
changed after a report showed that U.S. private employers added
fewer jobs in September than forecast.  Barclays Plc lost 2.2 percent after Nomura Holdings Inc.
sold 649 million pounds ($1.04 billion) of the British lender’s
shares in a derivative transaction with shareholder Sheikh
Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi.  Sage Group Plc  and
 Fresnillo Plc  fell after being downgraded by analysts.  Lonmin
Plc  and Xstrata Plc gained with metals prices.  The  FTSE 100 Index  dropped 0.1 percent to 5,657.61 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London, paring its gain this week to 1.2
percent. The gauge has dropped 2.9 percent from this year’s high
on April 15 as speculation grew that European governments’
austerity measures will curb economic growth while reports from
the U.S. pointed to a slowdown in the world’s largest economy.
The  FTSE All-Share Index  also retreated 0.1 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index lost 0.4 percent.  U.S. private employers added 64,000 posts in September,
less than the 75,000 expected in the poll. The  unemployment rate 
unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent. In total, U.S. employers cut
staffing by 95,000 workers in September after a revised 57,000
decrease in August, Labor Department figures in Washington
showed today. The median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 5,000 drop.  “We were expecting a less bullish number following the ADP
numbers this week,” Will Hedden, a trader at IG Index in
London, said. “The Fed is going to be forced to do something
and it’s more likely it will do so this side of Christmas. It’s
not a question of if, but of when” the Federal Reserve will add
to its asset purchases to stimulate growth.  Companies in the U.S. unexpectedly cut 39,000 workers in
September, figures from ADP Employer Services on Oct. 6 showed.
Economists had forecast that 20,000 jobs would be added.  Barclays Slides  Barclays, Britain’s third-biggest bank, dropped 2.2 percent
to 297.3 pence. PCP Gulf Invest 3 Ltd., a company controlled by
the Gulf emirate’s royal family member, bought protection
against a loss in value of its entire 6.3 percent stake in a
deal with Nomura.  Nomura today sold 220 million Barclays shares at 295 pence
apiece to hedge its commitment, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain unidentified.
Sheikh Mansour will retain 758 million shares in Barclays.  Sage  lost 4.6 percent to 269.6 pence. The U.K. software
maker was cut to “sell” from “neutral” by UBS AG, which
cited “low growth prospects.”  Fresnillo Falls  Fresnillo  retreated 3.2 percent to 1,248 pence. The mining
company was cut to “underperform” from “neutral” at BofA
Merrill Lynch Global Research, which said the shares are trading
at “a significant premium to the rest of the sector.”  Petropavlovsk Plc  dropped 4.8 percent to 1,020 pence, its
lowest price since August. Russia’s third-largest gold producer
said demand for a Hong Kong initial public offering of its IRC
Ltd. unit did not meet its “highest expectations.”  Lonmin , a platinum miner, gained 3.9 percent to 1,819
pence. Xstrata, the world’s fourth-largest copper producer,
jumped 2.9 percent to 1,296 pence. Gold rose to $1,346 an ounce
