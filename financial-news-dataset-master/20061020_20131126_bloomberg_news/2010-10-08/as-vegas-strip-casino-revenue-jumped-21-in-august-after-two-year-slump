Shares of MGM Resorts International,
Las Vegas Sands Corp. and  Wynn Resorts Ltd.  rose after  Las Vegas 
Strip gambling revenue jumped 21 percent in August, showing the
biggest U.S. casino city is emerging from a record slump.  Revenue rose to $544.4 million from $449.6 million in the
same month a year earlier, Nevada’s  Gaming Control Board  said
today in an e-mail. Strip casino proceeds increased 4.5 percent
in the first eight months of this year.  The three biggest publicly traded Las Vegas-based casino
owners noted signs of improvement on the Strip in the second
half during their most recent quarterly earnings announcements.
 Jim Murren , chief executive officer of MGM Resorts, the biggest
Strip owner, projected a “very solid” October in an interview
last month, as conventions return and vacationers help fill the
city with last-minute bookings.  MGM Resorts  rose  16 percent to $13.56 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Las Vegas Sands gained 4.3
percent to $37.30. Wynn Resorts added 5.1 percent to $93.85 on
the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Revenue for all Nevada casinos gained 12 percent to $944.5
million in August, the board said. Monthly proceeds for Clark
County, which includes downtown Las Vegas as well as the Strip,
climbed 14 percent to $806.1 million.  Convention Attendance  Resort operators in the largest U.S. casino and conference
market are booking more conventions to drive room prices higher
after slashing rates to attract gamblers and vacationers for
more than two years.  About 25.1 million people visited the Nevada city in the
eight months through August, a 2.5 percent increase from a year
earlier, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said
today on its website. Convention attendance is up 2.2 percent
and average daily rates at Vegas hotels have gained 1.3 percent
this year.  Average daily auto traffic arrivals rose 4.4 percent in
August, and air passengers declined 0.4 percent from the same
month a year ago.  Overall passenger traffic at the area’s McCarran
International Airport fell 2.4 percent in the eight months
through August, according to Clark County Department of Aviation
data released last month. That extended last year’s record 8.2
percent drop and 2008’s 7.7 percent decline, as carriers
including UAL Corp.’s United Airlines cut flights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
