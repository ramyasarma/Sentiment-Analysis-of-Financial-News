Transnet Ltd., South Africa’s state-
owned ports, rail and pipeline operator, said it may sell $1
billion worth of bonds in international markets in about three
months to pay for expansion.  “It’s to refinance maturing debt and fund the capital-
expenditure program,” Mboniso Sigonyela, a spokesman for the
company, said in an interview from Johannesburg today.  Transnet has 35.2 billion rand ($5 billion) of debt
outstanding, with 500 million rand of bonds with a floating rate
of 7.165 percent due to mature in July.  South African companies are boosting bond sales to repay
existing debt and secure longer-term financing as borrowing
costs sink. Local companies have increased bond sales by 10.6
percent to a five-year high of 57.75 billion rand so far this
year, Bloomberg data show.  Borrowing costs have slumped as the rand’s 36 percent surge
against the dollar since the start of last year reduced the cost
of imported oil, helping inflation ease to a 4 1/2-year low of
3.5 percent in August. The country’s benchmark money-market
rate, the three-month  Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate , was at
6.035 percent, near the 6.015 percent reached on Sept. 27, the
lowest since the central bank introduced its repurchase rate in
1999.  Transnet won’t “be held to any timeline” for selling
bonds, Sigonyela said. “It will depend on opportunities. We’re
not in a desperate cash situation, because we have about 6
billion rand cash in hand.”  Transnet’s acting Chief Executive Officer Chris Wells
yesterday said a planned oil pipeline between Johannesburg and
Durban will cost 14.1 billion rand to build between 2010 and
2015.  Transnet has received temporary funding for the project
from the National Treasury, which will be deducted from its
portion of the country’s fuel levy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
