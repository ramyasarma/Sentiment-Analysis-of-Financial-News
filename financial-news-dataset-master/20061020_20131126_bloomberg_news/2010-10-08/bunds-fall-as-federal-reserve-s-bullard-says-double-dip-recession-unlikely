German 10-year government bonds fell
after Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard
said the risk of a double dip recession has “probably receded
in the last six-to-eight weeks.”  The yield on the 10-year bund rose 3 basis points to 2.29
percent as of 11:15 a.m. in London.  “The big issue has been this soft patch this summer,”
Bullard said in an interview with CNBC. The double-dip “is
something I don’t think we’ll see.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
