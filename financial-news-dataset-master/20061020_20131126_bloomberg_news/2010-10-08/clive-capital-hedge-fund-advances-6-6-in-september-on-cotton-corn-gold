Clive Capital LLP’s $4 billion
commodity hedge fund returned 6.6 percent in September, the best
monthly return since May 2009, according to a report to
investors obtained by Bloomberg.  Clive Fund Ltd. increased 1.7 percent in the first nine
months, the London-based company said in the report. The figures
refer to Class B shares introduced in May 2008.  “The agriculture sector was the best performer with strong
profits in corn, cotton, soybeans and the oilseeds and vegetable
oil complex,” according to a commentary in the report of the
fund, which is managed by  Chris Levett . “The fund was
profitable in precious metals on the back of our length in gold,
platinum and palladium.”  Cotton futures jumped 18 percent in September and reached
the highest price in 15 years on concern demand from textile
mills would outstrip supply as floods destroyed crops in
Pakistan, and low temperatures and rain hurt production in China,
the biggest grower. Corn and soybeans advanced 13 percent and
9.6 percent, while gold climbed 4.9 percent, touching a record.  Clive beat average hedge fund returns globally of 3.4
percent last month, based on data from Chicago-based Hedge Fund
Research Inc., which tracks more than 2,200 such capital pools.  Hedge funds are largely unregulated investment vehicles
whose managers can trade any asset, aim to make money regardless
of whether markets rise or fall and participate substantially in
profits from money invested.  To contact the reporter on this story:
