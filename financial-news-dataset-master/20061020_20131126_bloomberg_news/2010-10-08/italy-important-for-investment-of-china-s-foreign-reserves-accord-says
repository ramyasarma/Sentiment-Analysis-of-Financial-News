Italy is an “important’ market for
the investment of China’s foreign exchange reserves, China said
in a trade and investment agreement signed with Italy.  China will “pay attention to and evaluate opportunities in
Italy’s financial market,” according to a three-year action
plan signed yesterday during Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao ’s visit
to Italy. A statement regarding the agreement was published on
the website of the State Council, China’s cabinet.  -- Li Yanping . Editor:  John Liu   To contact the reporter on this story:
