Crude oil may decline next week as
U.S. inventories increase and fuel consumption drops, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Seventeen of 33 analysts, or 52 percent, forecast crude oil
will decline through Oct. 15. Twelve respondents, or 36 percent,
predicted an increase, and four estimated prices will be little
changed. Last week, 42 percent said crude would climb.  U.S.  crude oil supplies  increased 3.09 million barrels to
360.9 million last week, leaving stockpiles 13 percent higher
than the five-year average for the period, an Energy Department
report on Oct. 6 showed.  Fuel consumption  dropped 6.4 percent to
18.5 million barrels a day, the biggest weekly decline since
Feb. 27, 2004, according to the department.  “Inventories are higher than a year ago, even when
adjusting for demand, yet prices are a good $10 higher,” said
 Tim Evans , an energy analyst with Citi Futures Perspective in
New York. “There’s just not the demand to justify the recent
rally in prices.”  Crude oil for November delivery increased 1.3 percent this
week to $82.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
third consecutive gain. Prices are up 15 percent from a year
ago. Oil in New York touched $84.43 a barrel yesterday, the
highest level since May 4.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
