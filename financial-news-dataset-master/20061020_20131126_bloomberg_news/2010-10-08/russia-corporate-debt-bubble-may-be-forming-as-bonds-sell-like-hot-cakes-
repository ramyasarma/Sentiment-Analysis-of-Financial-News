Russia’s Finance Ministry said a
“bubble” may be forming in the country’s financial markets
after a rally in company bonds.  “There’s a danger that bubbles will form again on the
financial markets,” Deputy Finance Minister  Dmitry Pankin  told
reporters in Washington, where he’s attending the annual
conference of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. In
Russia, corporate bonds are selling like “hot cakes,” he said.  “Corporations may be finding it easier to borrow and
investors aren’t being as vigilant with the quality of company
itself,” Pankin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
