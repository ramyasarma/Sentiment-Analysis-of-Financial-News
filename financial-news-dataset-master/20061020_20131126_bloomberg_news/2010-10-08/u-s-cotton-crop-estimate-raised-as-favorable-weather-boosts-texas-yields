The U.S. cotton crop will be 0.2
percent bigger than forecast a month ago, after beneficial
weather boosted yields in Texas and the Mississippi River Delta
region, the government said.  Production  will total 18.87 million bales, up from the
18.84 million projected in September, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a report. That’s 55 percent more than
the 12.19 million bales harvested last season. Nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News were expecting 18.9 million, on
average.  “The weather has been nearly perfect in most areas,”
 Peter Egli , the director of risk management in Chicago for
Plexus Cotton Ltd., a U.K.-based merchant, said before the
report. “You get more off the field when you’re not dealing
with all these problems. Texas looks good.”  Cotton futures for December delivery yesterday rose the
exchange limit of 4 cents, or 4 percent, to $1.0375 a pound on
ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price has climbed 66 percent
in the past year on tight global supplies and increased demand
from China, the biggest user.  Yields in Texas, the biggest producing state, will average
792 pounds an acre, up from 783 pounds estimated last month, the
USDA said. Last year, output in the state was 635 pounds an
acre. Yields also were raised for Mississippi and Louisiana.  The U.S., the world’s largest exporter, may export 15.5
million bales this year, unchanged from last month’s forecast,
the USDA said. That compares with 12 million bales in the year
that ended in July, the agency said.  “Adverse pre-harvest weather in several cotton-growing
areas of China may hinder production and quality, suggesting the
world’s largest importer may need to import even more fiber in
2010-11, with much of that coming from the U.S.,”  Gary Raines ,
an economist at FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville,
Tennessee, wrote in an e-mail before the report.  U.S. stockpiles  at the end of this season will be 2.7
million bales, also unchanged from last month’s estimate,
according to the report.  A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms. About 25
percent of the U.S. crop had been harvested as of Oct. 3, the
USDA said this week.  World output  will be 116.7 million bales, down from last
month’s forecast of 117 million. Global use will be 120.8
million bales, up from the September projection of 120.5
million, the USDA said. Unsold supplies at the end of the
marketing year will total 44.66 million bales, compared with the
previous estimate of 45.4 million, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
