Steve Leuthold , whose  Leuthold Core
Investment Fund  has beaten 85 percent of its competitors in the
past five years, said he boosted his stock holdings and may
invest as much as 70 percent in equities because the market is
poised to reach a new 2010 high.  The investor, who bet on stocks before the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  started the biggest rally since the Great
Depression in March 2009, said he lifted the net equity position
of the $1.32 billion Leuthold Core Investment Fund and the $1.25
billion Leuthold Asset Allocation Fund to 60 percent from 46
percent in July. The Leuthold Global Fund, which has $294.5
million in assets, has between 62 percent and 63 percent in
equities, he said.  While the benchmark measure for U.S. equities posted the
biggest September rally since 1939, it has failed to exceed the
19-month high reached in April amid concern that the European
debt crisis will slow global economic growth and after analysts
cut 2011 profit estimates for the first time in a year. Leuthold
said he sees signs stocks will keep rising.  “The market looks pretty healthy,” Minneapolis-based
Leuthold, 72, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “It’s
becoming clear that the economy is in a recovery mode. We look
at the valuations and the technical side. I wouldn’t be
surprised to see the market move to new highs maybe as soon as
the end of November.”  Services, Japan  The S&P 500 climbed to 1,160.75 on Oct. 5, the highest
level since May, after American service industries expanded more
than forecast and speculation grew that the Federal Reserve will
join Japan’s efforts to stoke economic growth. The stock index
has traded between 1,217.28 on April 23 and 1,022.58 on July 2
this year. It is valued at 12.1 times  projected  earnings for the
next 12 months, compared with a 16.5 average since 1954 using
reported results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Leuthold said he recently bought stocks of health-care
management companies and “we’ve become more enamored with”
industrial companies. The investor said he doesn’t like
 financial  shares.  Banks “are going to have continued margin pressures,”
Leuthold said. “We really don’t have much in terms of
financials. There hasn’t been a great deal of loan demand here
and the spreads are not terribly attractive for some banks.”  Less Lending  Commercial and industrial lending fell to $1.24 trillion in
the week ended Sept. 8 from $1.4 trillion a year earlier, Fed
data show. Banks’  holdings  of government debt reached a record
$1.6 trillion in the week ended Sept. 1, 15 percent more than a
year earlier, according to Fed data compiled by Bloomberg going
back to 1973.  Leuthold’s returns have lagged behind his peers during the
past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Core
fund has topped 5 percent of competitors, while the Allocation
fund is in the 33th percentile. The Global fund is beating 80
percent.  The investor says he’s pessimistic about the second half of
2011 and believes the  S&P 500  may drop as low as 850 or 900. The
index rose 0.6 percent to 1,165.15 at 4 p.m. in New York after a
worse-than-estimated report on American jobs bolstered
speculation that the Fed will enact economic stimulus measures.  “I’m concerned as to what might happen or what might not
happen next year in addressing the big gorilla in the room,
which is the huge budget deficit,” he said. “You’re going to
see trouble by the last half. It’s probably going to be related
to increasing concerns about the dollar, increasing concerns
about monetary debasement.”  Falling Dollar  Bets the Fed will weaken the currency by stepping up
purchases of government debt has driven the U.S. dollar to the
lowest level since 1995 against the yen. The  Dollar Index , which
tracks the greenback against six major currencies, has dropped
4.2 percent since Aug. 10, when the Fed said after its policy
meeting that it would keep its bond holdings level by resuming
the purchase of U.S. debt to support a recovery it described as
“more modest” than earlier anticipated.  “I do hope that they pull in their horns and recognize the
modest improvement that is taking place in the economy and don’t
do it,” Leuthold said. “This could be devastating for the U.S.
currency. What it really does is destroy wealth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
