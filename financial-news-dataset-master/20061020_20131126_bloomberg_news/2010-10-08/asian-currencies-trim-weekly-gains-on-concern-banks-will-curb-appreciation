Asian currencies rose for a sixth
week, the longest winning streak in a year, on speculation the
Federal Reserve will pump more money into its economy,
increasing funds available to invest in higher-yielding assets.  The currencies retreated from their highs yesterday on
concern regional central banks will intervene or introduce
measures to stem gains. Thailand’s baht fell from a 13-year high,
dropping 0.7 percent to 30.08 per dollar in Bangkok yesterday
and trimming its five-day appreciation to 0.5 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. South Korea’s won declined 0.5
percent to 1,120.15, paring its weekly gain to 0.9 percent.  “The basic trend remains for Asian currencies to
strengthen due to fund inflows and the economic growth story,”
 Tohru Nishihama , an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in Tokyo, said yesterday in an interview. “Given
the very fast appreciation in regional currencies recently, we
may see intervention from some central banks.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies excluding the yen, rose 0.1
percent from a week ago to 115.10. It reached 115.46 on Oct. 7,
the highest level in more than two years.  Thailand’s Prime Minister  Abhisit Vejjajiva  said the
Cabinet will consider measures next week to help reduce the
impact from the baht’s strength. Japan last month intervened in
the foreign-exchange market for the first time in six years to
rein in yen gains. Regulators in South Korea are due to start an
audit of lenders handling currency derivatives on Oct. 19.  Asian Growth  Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.4 percent in 2010,
outpacing growth of 2.7 percent in advanced countries, the
International Monetary Fund forecast on Oct. 6. Overseas
investors have pumped more than a net $37 billion into Indian,
South Korean and Taiwanese equities this year, according to
exchange data.  Taiwan’s dollar completed a sixth weekly gain after the
government Oct. 7 reported an 11th straight increase in monthly
exports for September.  “Hot money is a global problem because everyone is doing
quantitative easing, especially in America,” said  Albert Lee , a
fixed-income trader at Cathay United Bank Co. in Taipei. “More
money is coming out. This money has got to go somewhere and it
is going to Asia.”  China’s yuan rose to the highest level against the dollar
since 1993 yesterday on speculation the country will let the
currency strengthen more quickly as international leaders step
up calls for faster appreciation.  The yuan gained 0.3 percent to 6.6734 from Sept. 30, the
last trading day before a weeklong holiday. It touched 6.6703,
the strongest level since the central bank unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Malaysia’s ringgit dropped 0.9 percent this week to 3.1105
per dollar. Singapore’s currency gained 0.1 percent to S$1.3111
and the Philippine peso climbed 1 percent to 43.445. Indonesia’s
rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 8,938.  To contact the reporter on this story:
