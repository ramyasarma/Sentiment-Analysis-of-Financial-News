North Korea confirmed for the first
time that  Kim Jong Il ’s son will succeed him as the country’s
leader, the Associated Press Television News reported, citing an
interview with Politburo member  Yang Hyong Sop .  Kim Jong Un , who South Korean officials say is in his late
20s, was elected to the ruling party’s No. 2 military post at a
meeting on Sept. 28. His appointment, a day after he was made a
four-star general, was the first indication that his father
planned to extend his family’s rule, which began with North
Korea’s founder,  Kim Il Sung .  “Our people are honored to be led by the great President
Kim Il Sung and the great general Kim Jong Il,” Yang said in the
interview today in Pyongyang. “Now we also have the honor of
being led by General Kim Jong Un.”  Yang, 85, is vice president of North Korea’s Supreme
People’s Assembly and one of 17 permanent members of the
Politburo. He was one of several octogenarians retained by Kim
Jong Il in what analysts said was an attempt to safeguard the
succession.  “Our people take pride in the fact that they are blessed
with great leaders from generation to generation,” Yang told
APTN. “What I can tell you is that the great general Kim Jong
Il and general Kim Jong Un will lead us to victory with their
wise guidance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
