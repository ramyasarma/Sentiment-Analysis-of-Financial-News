Canadian Finance Minister Jim
Flaherty said that it would not be in China’s interest if a
“currency war” breaks among major economies.  “China needs western economies to sell its goods,”
Flaherty told reporters. “It is not in their interest to have
currency wars.”  Flaherty made the comments in Washington, where he is
attending international monetary meetings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
