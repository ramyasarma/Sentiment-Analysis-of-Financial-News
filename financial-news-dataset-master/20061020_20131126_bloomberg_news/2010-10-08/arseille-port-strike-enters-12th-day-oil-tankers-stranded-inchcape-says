A strike at Marseille, France’s
biggest oil port, continued for a 12th day, Inchcape Shipping
Services said in an e-mail today.  Several ships couldn’t dock at the port’s oil terminal,
including tankers carrying crude, refined oil products, bulk
chemical carriers and gas vessels, according to a statement from
the port authority yesterday.  Refineries dependent on crude imports from the port may be
forced to start halting operations from next week, Jean-Louis
Schilansky, head of refiners’ organization Union Francaise des
Industries Petrolieres, said earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
