Copper prices rose to a 27-month high
after a larger-than-forecast cut in U.S. jobs spurred
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will take more steps to
bolster the economy, weighing on the dollar.  Employers cut staffing by 95,000 workers in September,
Labor Department figures showed today. The median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was a 5,000 drop. The
dollar fell below 82 yen for the first time since 1995. The
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials rose to the
highest level in almost two years.  “The market is expecting greater stimulus,” following the
jobs report, said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services in  Chicago . “Copper will lead other metals
higher.”  Copper futures for December delivery rose 9.5 cents, or 2.6
percent, to close at $3.7745 a pound at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . Earlier, the metal reached $3.8015, the highest
level for a most-active contract since July 7, 2008.  This week, copper advanced 2.3 percent, the fourth straight
gain. The price has climbed 13 percent this year.  Metals will be “better places to park money” than
currencies, said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps manage $13.3
billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati. Copper may
drop 15 percent to 20 percent on “profit-taking” before rising
again, he said.  The metal has gained 31 percent since July 1 as the dollar
slumped and inventories dropped.  A rebound in U.S. and European demand will cause a global
copper deficit to widen, said Marcelo Awad, the chief executive
officer of London-based metal producer Antofagasta Plc. Demand
will exceed supply by 300,000 metric tons in 2010 and 400,000 to
450,000 tons in 2011, Awad said today in an interview in
Santiago.  Copper for delivery in three months rose $210, or 2.6
percent, to $8,310 a ton ($3.77 a pound) on the  London  Metal
Exchange.  Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also rose.  To contact the reporters on the story:
