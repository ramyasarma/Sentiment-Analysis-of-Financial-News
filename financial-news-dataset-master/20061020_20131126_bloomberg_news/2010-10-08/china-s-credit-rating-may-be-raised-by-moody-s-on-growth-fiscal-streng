Moody’s Investors Service put China’s
debt rating on review for a possible upgrade, sending stocks
surging in the first day of trading after a five-day holiday and
the yuan to the highest level against the dollar since 1993.  The review of the A1 ranking, Moody’s fifth-highest, will
be completed within three months, the ratings company said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The Shanghai Composite Index  jumped 2.9 percent as of 11:11
a.m. local time. The confidence in China signaled by Moody’s
contrasts with concern at the outlook for developed economies,
including in Europe, where the company this week put Irish debt
on review for a possible downgrade.  “The resilient performance of the Chinese economy
following the onset of the global financial crisis, and
expectations of continued strong growth over the medium term”
are the main reason for the review, Moody’s said in today’s
statement.  Moody’s also cited what it termed an effective stimulus
program, which is now being unwound, the central government’s
credit fundamentals, and the likely containment of losses from
record lending.  The rating review affects the government’s A1 foreign and
local-currency bond ratings, China’s A1 country ceilings for
foreign and local-currency bank deposits, and its A1 ceilings
for foreign and local currency bonds.  The yuan advanced 0.31 percent to 6.6703 against the
greenback as of 10:33 a.m. in Shanghai, from 6.6912 on Sept. 30,
the last trading day before a series of Chinese holidays. It
touched 6.6703, the strongest level since the central bank
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
