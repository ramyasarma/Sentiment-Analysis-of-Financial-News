Deutsche Bank AG’s planned takeover
of Deutsche Postbank AG may lead to job cuts at both companies,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing the offer document.  Likely cost reductions of 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion)
from the combination will come partly from unspecified job
losses at both banks, the newspaper said. Unions plan to resist
staff cuts, Handelsblatt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
