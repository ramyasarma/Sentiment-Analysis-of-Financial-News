Richard Bernstein , who was the chief
investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co. until 2009, will
manage a new global stock mutual fund for Eaton Vance Corp.,
according to a regulatory filing.  The  Eaton Vance Richard Bernstein Multi-Market Equity
Strategy Fund  will be “managed in a macro-driven, top-down
style that will emphasize and deemphasize various global equity
market segments at different times,” according to a July filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preliminary
prospectus is dated October 2010, indicating it may open for
business this month.  The fund’s holdings of U.S., developed-market and emerging-
market equities will vary based on quantitative indicators and
economic analysis, the filing says.  Bernstein joined New York-based Merrill Lynch in 1988 and
quit in 2009 after it was purchased by Bank of America Corp. of
Charlotte, North Carolina, to found Richard Bernstein Advisors
LLC. He was the top-ranked analyst in his category 10 times in
Institutional Investor magazine’s annual poll, according to his
company’s  website .  A receptionist at New York-based Richard Bernstein Advisors
said he was out of the office, and Bernstein didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Eaton Vance , based in
Boston, managed $173.3 billion as of July 31, including $57
billion in equity funds and $49.3 billion in bond and bank-loan
funds.  Robyn Tice , a spokeswoman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
