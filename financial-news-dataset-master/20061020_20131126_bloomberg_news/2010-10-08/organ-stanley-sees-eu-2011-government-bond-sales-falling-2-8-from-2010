Euro area nations may sell 925
billion euros ($1.3 trillion) of government bonds in 2011, a
decrease of 2.8 percent from this year, Morgan Stanley said.  “Austerity measures by European governments and
diversified funding sources are drivers for the lower issuance
in 2011 than that in 2010,” Elaine Lin , an analyst at the bank
in London, said today in a research report. Issuance may be
little changed at 926 billion euros in 2012, she wrote.  Sales of short-term Treasury bills, which aren’t included
in the estimates, may fall next year in Germany, France and the
Netherlands, Lin said in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
