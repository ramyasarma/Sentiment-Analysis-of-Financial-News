The yuan rose to the highest level
against the dollar since 1993 on speculation China will
accelerate gains in the currency as international leaders step
up calls for faster appreciation.  The central bank set the daily reference rate for yuan
trading at the strongest level since a dollar peg was scrapped
in July 2005 as Premier Wen Jiabao said this week China will
gradually increase flexibility in the currency. U.S. Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  reiterated yesterday that he wants
China to let the yuan rise, saying the “main problem” is that
a group of developing nations are not allowing their currencies
to strengthen.  “China realizes that it won’t be that harmful to let the
yuan appreciate a little faster,” said  David Cohen , an
economist at Action Economics in Singapore. “It may go back to
the 5 percent to 8 percent annual appreciation that we saw
during the three years” since 2005, he said.  The yuan advanced 0.31 percent to 6.6703 against the
greenback as of 10:33 a.m. in Shanghai, from 6.6912 on Sept. 30,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched
6.6703, the strongest level since the central bank unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993. China’s
financial markets reopened today after a five-day holiday.  Central bank Vice Governor Yi Gang said yesterday China
will do its part to help correct imbalances in the world economy
through a “gradual” appreciation of the yuan. The currency has
climbed 2.3 percent since a fixed-exchange rate was abandoned on
June 19.  “We want to do our contribution,” Yi said at a press
conference at the International Monetary Fund in Washington.
“Our approach would be a gradual one.”  The European Union’s trade deficit with China widened 6.7
percent to 48.1 billion euros ($67 billion) in the first half of
2010. The  U.S. deficit  climbed 16 percent to $119 billion.  China set the reference rate at 6.6830 today. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent either side of the fixing.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Simon Harvey   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
