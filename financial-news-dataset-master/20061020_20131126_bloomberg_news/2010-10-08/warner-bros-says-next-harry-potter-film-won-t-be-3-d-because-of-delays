The next “ Harry Potter ” film won’t
be shown in 3-D because Warner Bros. couldn’t convert the movie
in time for the Nov. 19 release date.  “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1” will be
distributed in the standard two-dimensional format, the  Time
Warner Inc.  studio said today in a statement.  The decision means Warner Bros. will lose the average $3-
per-ticket premium typically charged for movies shown in 3-D.
The first six films, all shown in 2-D, have averaged $903
million in global ticket sales, according to  Box Office Mojo , a
researcher based in Sherman Oaks, California.  “We were unable to convert the film in its entirety and
meet the highest standards of quality,” the studio said.  The final movie in the “Potter” series, “Harry Potter
and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2,” will be released in both 2-
D and 3-D, Warner Bros. said. It’s scheduled for release on July
15, 2011, according to the studio.  Time Warner, based in New York, gained 52 cents to $31.31
at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The
stock has gained 7.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
