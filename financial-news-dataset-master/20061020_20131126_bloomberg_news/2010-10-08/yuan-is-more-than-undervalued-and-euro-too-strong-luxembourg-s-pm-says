China’s yuan is “more than
undervalued” and the euro is “too strong today” with an
exchange rate of $1.40 to the euro, Luxembourg Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs meetings of euro-region finance
ministers, told reporters in Washington today.  Juncker said he’s “not happy” about the euro’s strength
and that the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate isn’t in line with
fundamentals.  While “others are talking to the Chinese” about their
currency, Europe is “not lecturing the Chinese publicly,” he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
