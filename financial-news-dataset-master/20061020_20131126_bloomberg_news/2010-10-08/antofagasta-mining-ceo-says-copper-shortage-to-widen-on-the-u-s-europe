Antofagasta Plc ’s  Marcelo Awad , chief
executive officer of its mining division, said recovering copper
demand in Europe and the U.S. will widen a global shortfall of
the metal.  Copper demand will surpass supply by about 300,000 metric
tons in 2010 and between 400,000 and 450,000 tons in 2011, Awad
said today in an interview in Santiago. Antofagasta, based in
London, is controlled by  Chile’s Luksic family.   Copper prices have surged more than 30 percent in the past
12 months as China, the world’s largest consumer of the metal
used in electrical wire and power cables, boosted purchases. The
first recovery in demand from Europe and the U.S. since 2008
will deepen an inventory shortage at London Metal Exchange
warehouses, Awad said.  “Chinese demand has been very strong, but we now have
added demand from the economies of Europe and the U.S.,” Awad
said. “And other economies will join this process.”  Copper demand in Europe may rise 2.5 percent this year,
Awad said. U.S. copper demand will climb 2 percent and China
will boost its usage of the metal by almost 10 percent, he said.  Antofagasta, which operates three copper mines in Chile,
will start its fourth mine called Esperanza between Nov. 15-20,
Awad said.  The company will ramp up production in the first quarter of
2011 and produce about 170,000 metric tons of copper next year.
The mine will reach its capacity of 200,000 tons a year by 2012,
Awad said.  Copper futures for December delivery rose 4.25 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $3.733 a pound at 9:52 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The most-active contract was up 1.2 percent for the week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
