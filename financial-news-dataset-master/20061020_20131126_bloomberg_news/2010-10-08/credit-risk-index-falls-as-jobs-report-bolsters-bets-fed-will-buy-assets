A gauge of corporate credit risk in
the U.S. fell to a five-month low as a bigger-than-estimated
decline in the nation’s payrolls last month bolstered bets the
Federal Reserve will increase asset purchases to support the
economy.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell 1.1 basis point to a mid-price of 97.3
basis points as of 8:54 a.m. in New York, according to Markit
Group Ltd. The index, which typically falls as investor
sentiment improves and rises as it deteriorates, is trading at
the lowest since May 3.  Employers cut staffing by 95,000 workers in September after
a revised 57,000 decrease in August, Labor Department figures in
Washington showed today. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a decline of 5,000. The
unemployment rate held at 9.6 percent.  The Fed, considering whether to add to its purchases of
Treasury bonds to stimulate the economy, said after its Sept. 21
meeting that it was “prepared to provide additional
accommodation if needed.”  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
