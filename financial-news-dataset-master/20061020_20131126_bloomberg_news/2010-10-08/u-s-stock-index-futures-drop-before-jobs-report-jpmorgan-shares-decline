U.S. stocks gained, sending the Dow
Jones Industrial Average above 11,000 for the first time since
before the May 6 crash, as worse-than-estimated jobs data raised
speculation the Federal Reserve will enact stimulus measures.  Alcoa Inc.  rose 5.7 percent after beating profit estimates.
 CF Industries Holdings Inc. , Deere & Co. and Monsanto Co. surged
more than 4.1 percent as the U.S. government cut crop supply
forecasts. Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc. dropped at
least 6.7 percent on concern feed costs will rise.  J.C. Penney
Co.  and Fortune Brands Inc. rallied more than 2.6 percent after
Pershing Square Capital Management LP disclosed stakes.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.6 percent to
1,165.15 at 4 p.m. in New York and earlier exceeded 1,165.90,
its closing level the day before the May 6 plunge. The Dow
gained 57.90 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,006.48. The dollar
 slid  below 82 yen for the first time since 1995 amid bets the
Fed will purchase Treasuries, a tactic know as quantitative
easing, to inject cash into the economy.  “The data are disappointing in terms of both overall
levels and the dynamics of job creation,”  Mohamed A. El-Erian ,
chief executive at Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs
the world’s biggest bond fund, wrote in an e-mail to Bloomberg
News. “They increase the probability of the Fed implementing
additional QE.”  Weekly Rally  More than 40 stocks in the S&P 500 rose to 52-week  highs 
today. The index rose 1.7 percent this week, including the 2.1
percent advance on Oct. 5 amid speculation the Fed would join
the Bank of Japan in taking steps to safeguard the recovery. The
gauge is down 4.3 percent from this year’s high in April on
concern U.S. unemployment and widening budget deficits in Europe
will derail global growth.  The Labor Department report that the nation lost 95,000
jobs last month was the latest evidence that the recovery from
the recession may be faltering. The data signals the Fed may buy
$1.2 trillion of Treasuries as a way to inject more cash into
the economy and spur growth,  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s
biggest bond fund at Pimco, said in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  The number of jobs lost last month was 19 times the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. It was led by a
decline in government payrolls that shows the damage being done
by rising budget deficits.  Record Streak  Private payrolls that exclude government agencies climbed
64,000, less than forecast, underscoring the concern expressed
by some Fed policy makers that the economic recovery may require
easier monetary policy. The unemployment rate held at 9.6
percent and has equaled or exceeded 9.5 percent for 14
consecutive months, the longest span of elevated joblessness
since monthly records began in 1948.  “This data supports the prevailing idea that quantitative
easing is coming by the Fed,” said  Linda Bakhshian , who manages
equity-income funds at Federated Investors Inc. in Pittsburgh.
“By doing quantitative easing, it effectively reduces interest
rates, which reduces the capital costs to businesses.”
Federated manages $337 billion.  The benchmark index for U.S. stock options fell to the
lowest level since May 3. The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index is known, dropped 3.9 percent to
20.71. The gauge, which measures the cost of using options as
insurance against declines in the S&P 500, is down from this
year’s peak of 45.79 on May 20.  Alcoa, CF  Alcoa advanced 5.7 percent to $12.89. The largest U.S.
aluminum producer topped the average analyst earnings estimate
by 67 percent and said growth in Chinese demand will help boost
global use by 13 percent this year. A gauge of  raw-materials
producers  including Alcoa rose 2 percent, the biggest gain in
the S&P 500 within 10 industries.  CF Industries, a fertilizer maker, surged 11 percent to
$109.90 for the biggest gain in the S&P 500. Its rivals also
rallied.  Agrium Inc.  climbed 7.5 percent to $81.08, and Mosaic
Co. advanced 6.6 percent to $65.61.  Deere , a maker of farming
equipment, jumped 4.8 percent to $75.35. Monsanto, the world’s

to $15.01. Smithfield, the biggest pork producer, fell 6.7
percent to $14.97.  Grain and oilseed prices rose the most allowed by the
Chicago Board of Trade after the U.S. government said domestic
and world supplies of corn, soybeans and wheat will be smaller
than forecast last month.  Corn, Soybeans, Wheat  The U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its domestic corn-
crop estimate for the second time in as many months, predicting
a 3.4 percent drop from last year. While farmers will collect
the most soybeans ever, the total will be 2.2 percent less than
forecast in September, the USDA said. Global wheat inventories
will be 1.8 percent less than projected last month.  J.C. Penney  gained 2.7 percent to $32.49 after jumping 9.1
percent yesterday. Pershing Square, the New York hedge-fund firm
led by  William Ackman , disclosed a 16.5 percent stake in  the 
company, making it the retailer’s largest investor. Pershing
plans to engage in talks with J.C. Penney’s  board  and managers
regarding the company’s performance, according to the filing.  Fortune Brands  climbed 7.4 percent, the most since
September 2009, to $55.85. Pershing Square said it took an 11
percent stake in the maker of Moen faucets and Jim Beam bourbon.  Steve Leuthold , whose  Leuthold Core Investment Fund  has
beaten 85 percent of its competitors in the past five years,
said he boosted his stock holdings and may invest as much as 70
percent in equities because the market is poised to reach a new
2010 high.  ‘Pretty Healthy’  “The market looks pretty healthy,” Leuthold, 72, said in
a telephone interview yesterday. “It’s becoming clear that the
economy is in a recovery mode. We look at the valuations and the
technical side. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the market move
to new highs maybe as soon as the end of November.”  Apple Inc.  gained 1.7 percent to $294.07. China Telecom
Corp., the nation’s third-largest mobile phone-company, may have
held “intensive talks” with the maker of iPhones to offer the
device early next year, according to Deutsche Bank AG analysts.  Micron Technology Inc.  added 6.8 percent to $7.59. The

percent to $13.60. News Corp. rose 1.8 percent to $13.88.  Adobe Systems Inc.  lost 5.9 percent to $26.99, a day after
surging 12 percent following a New York Times report that the
design-software company may have held merger talks with
Microsoft Corp. Speculation about a takeover is “nonsense,”
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people at
both companies.  Motorola Inc.  slumped 3.4 percent to $8.30. The mobile-
phone maker was cut to “hold” from “buy” at Citigroup Inc.  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.  introduced the 12th U.S. stock
