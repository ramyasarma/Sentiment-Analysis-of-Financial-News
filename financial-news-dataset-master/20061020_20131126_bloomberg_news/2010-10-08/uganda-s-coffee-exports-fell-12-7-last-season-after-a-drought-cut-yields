Coffee exports from Uganda, Africa’s
biggest exporter of the beans, fell 12.7 percent in 2009-10
after a drought cut yields, the Uganda Coffee Development
Authority said.  Shipments in the 12 months through September declined to
2.67 million, 60-kilogram (110-pound) bags, from 3.06 million
bags in 2008-09, the agency said in an e-mail from the capital,
Kampala.  Coffee export revenue in the season declined 16.4 percent
to $243.57 million from $291.29 million in 2008-09, the
authority said.  Exports in September, the last month in the season,
declined 14.7 percent to 169,728 bags, worth $19 million, from
198,988 bags a year earlier, the agency said. Robusta accounted
for 73.2 percent of the beans shipped last month, it said.  The east African country experienced a drought last year.
Uganda’s coffee is largely rain-fed because of lack of
irrigation capacity by smallholders who produce more than 95
percent of the crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
