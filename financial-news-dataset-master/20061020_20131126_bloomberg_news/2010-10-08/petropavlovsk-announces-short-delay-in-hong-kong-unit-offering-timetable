Petropavlovsk Plc, conducting an
initial public offering of its IRC Ltd. unit in Hong Kong, said
that demand did not meet the company’s “highest expectations.”  Petropavlovsk plans to publish a supplemental prospectus in
Hong Kong which will result in a “short delay” in the
timetable, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
