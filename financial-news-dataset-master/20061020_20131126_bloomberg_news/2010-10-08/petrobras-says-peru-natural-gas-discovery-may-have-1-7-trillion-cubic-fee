Petroleo Brasileiro SA  said a
discovery in Peru may hold 1.7 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable natural gas, enough to more than double the
company’s foreign reserves of the fuel.  Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled company is known,
discovered gas in the Picha 2X well in Block 58 in Peru’s Cuzco
department, according to a regulatory filing today. Gas was
found in a previous well, Urubamba 1X, in 2009, Petrobras said.  The find could more than double Petrobras’s 1.2 trillion
cubic feet of natural-gas reserves outside of Brazil, based on
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. Petrobras
says on its website that it has total reserves, including from
Brazilian deposits, of 11 trillion cubic feet.  Petrobras is exploring for gas in Peru near Camisea, the
Andean country’s largest gas fields. Petrobras plans to drill a
third well at Block 58 before year-end, Peruvian Energy Minister
 Pedro Sanchez  said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
