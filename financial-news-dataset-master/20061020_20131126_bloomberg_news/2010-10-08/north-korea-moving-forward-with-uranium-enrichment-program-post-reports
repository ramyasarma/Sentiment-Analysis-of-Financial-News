North Korea may be moving ahead with
a program to enrich uranium to make nuclear weapons, the
Washington Post reported, citing a report to be released later
today by the Institute for Science and International Security.  North Korea is capable of building a pilot plant of
centrifuges to enrich uranium, according to the  ISIS  report,
based on information from intelligence agencies, government
officials and media reports, the newspaper said.  Kim Jong IL’s regime could possess between 500 and 1,000
centrifuges, while it would take 3,000 to make enough enriched
uranium for a bomb, the Post said.  North Korea restored its Yongbyon nuclear reactor, which
had been disabled under a February 2007 accord, since six-party
disarmament talks last met in December 2008. The country told
the United Nations Security Council in September last year it
was “weaponizing” plutonium and had almost succeeded in highly
enriching uranium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
