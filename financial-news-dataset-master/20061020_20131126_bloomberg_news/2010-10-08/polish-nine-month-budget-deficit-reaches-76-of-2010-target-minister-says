Poland’s January-September central
government budget deficit widened to about 39.5 billion zloty,
or 76 percent of the limit for the full year, Deputy Finance
Minister Hanna Majszczyk told reporters in Warsaw today.  The figure compares with 36.9 billion zloty, or 71 percent
of the goal, at the end of August.  The budget is performing better than expected due to lower
than forecast spending, Majszczyk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
