Brazilian Finance Minister Guido
Mantega said the Group of 20 can strike an agreement akin to
1985’s Plaza Accord on how to manage currencies.  “We can achieve agreement about how to manage that question
of currency,” Mantega told reporters in Washington today. “We
can begin the discussion. We can arrive at agreement something
like the Plaza Accord that we had in 1985.”  “We can solve the problems if we have collective action,”
he said. “We must do that because instead we will have many
problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
