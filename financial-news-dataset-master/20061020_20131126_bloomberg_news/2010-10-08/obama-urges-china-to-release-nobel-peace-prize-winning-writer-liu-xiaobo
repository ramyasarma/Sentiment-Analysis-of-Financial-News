President  Barack Obama  called on the
Chinese government to release jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo, who
won the Nobel Peace Prize today for his struggle to promote
human rights and democracy.  “Over the last 30 years, China has made dramatic progress
in economic reform and improving the lives of its people,
lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty,” Obama said in a
statement released by the White House. “But this award reminds
us that political reform has not kept pace, and that the basic
human rights of every man, woman and child must be respected.
We call on the Chinese government to release Mr. Liu as soon as
possible.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
