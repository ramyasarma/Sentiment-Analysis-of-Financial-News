Petroleo Brasileiro SA , the Brazilian
oil company that sold shares last month in the world’s largest
offering, expects a revision of its investment plan to be ready
by the end of the first quarter, Chief Executive Officer  Jose Sergio Gabrielli  said.  Petrobras, as the company based in Rio de Janeiro is known,
plans no more share offerings and will sell debt to raise $60
billion in the next five years to finance its $224 billion
investment plan, Gabrielli told reporters today in Rio de
Janeiro.  Petrobras raised about $70 billion in a share sale in
September to help finance its investment plan, the global oil
industry’s largest. The company aims to double production to
5.38 million barrels a day by 2020 by tapping deepwater fields,
including the Tupi find, the Americas’ biggest discovery in
three decades.  “It’s an absolute certainty” that Petrobras will have to
increase its investment plan,  Scott Darling , a Dubai-based
analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a telephone interview
Oct. 6.  Petrobras may issue $15 billion a year in debt between 2011
and 2014 to pay for the expanded investment plan, Darling said
in a note to clients this week.  The company aims to have as many as 35 billion barrels of
reserves by 2014, Gabrielli said. The company will hire 14,000
people by then, he said.  Petrobras today fell to the lowest price since March 3,
2009, losing 2.2 percent to 25.30 reais, on concern its stock
sale exhausted demand for the shares. It’s down 31 percent this
year, more than the 27 percent plunge for BP Plc, the driller
that set aside $32.2 billion to pay for the worst oil spill in
U.S. history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
