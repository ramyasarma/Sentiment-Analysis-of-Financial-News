BP Plc , Europe’s second-biggest oil
company by market value, is considering an overhaul of its
trading arm to focus on emerging markets after the division’s
profitability slumped.  “There is a review underway in light of the trading
environment over the past few quarters,” said  Toby Odone , a
London-based spokesman for BP. “The aim is to increase
efficiency and make integrated supply and trading more efficient
and more profitable.”  Global oil prices have stayed between $60 and $87 since the
middle of last year and refining profit margins have narrowed,
limiting the scope for traders to make money on volatility in
the market. BP’s biggest hubs for traders are in Houston, London
and Singapore, while the fastest growth in energy demand is
coming from emerging markets such as China and India.  New York crude futures surged to a record $147 in 2008 and
then slumped to $34 within six months during the global economic
crisis. The price has now traded within a range of about $20 for
more than a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
