 Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank,
Germany’s development agency for agribusiness, added A$400
million to its existing line of 6.5 percent kangaroo bonds due
in April 2017, according to an e-mailed statement from JPMorgan
Chase & Co. which helped manage the sale.  The notes were priced to yield 107 basis points more than
similar maturity Australian government debt, according to the
