Amadeus IT Holding SA shareholders
are selling a stake in the flight-reservations provider for as
much as 629 million euros ($876 million) after the stock gained
more than 25 percent since its  initial public offering  in April.  The Spanish airline Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA and
private-equity firms BC Partners Ltd. and Cinven Ltd. are
selling a combined 10.2 percent holding at 13.25 euros to 13.75
euros, according to terms of the sale obtained by Bloomberg
News. Amadeus closed yesterday at 13.87 euros compared with its
11 euros-a-share IPO price.  Amadeus , based in Madrid, is suspended and set to resume
trading after 10:15 a.m. local time.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan
Stanley are organizing the sale, according to a filing they made
today to Spanish regulators.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
