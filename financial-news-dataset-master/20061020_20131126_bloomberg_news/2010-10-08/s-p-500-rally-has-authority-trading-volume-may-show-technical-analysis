The monthlong rally in U.S. stocks
has lifted the  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index above four
“resistance levels” on surging volume, a sign that the gain is
likely to continue, according to Strategas Research Partners.  Rising shares  accounted for more than 90 percent of trading
volume on Sept. 1, when the S&P 500 pushed through the 1,065
barrier, and on Sept. 20, when it closed above 1,131 for the
first time since May. The market had another “90 percent up
day” on Sept. 24, when the index ended the week above 1,140,
which represents the 61.8 percent  retracement  of the market’s
April peak to July low. Advancing shares dominated trading again
on Oct. 5, when the S&P 500 broke through 1,158.  “Such days are rare, particularly when they occur in
bunches,”  Christopher Verrone , head of technical analysis at
New York-based Strategas, wrote in a note yesterday. “This
tells us that the market isn’t casually challenging resistance,
but rather, is doing so with authority.”  The S&P 500 had declined as much as 16 percent from this
year’s high in April on concern that American unemployment and
widening budget deficits in Europe will derail global growth.
The gauge rose 13 percent since July 2 as the Federal Reserve
said it’s willing to ease monetary policy further to spur the
economy.  As shares rallied, the proportion of stocks on the New York
Stock Exchange trading above their averages during the previous
200 days climbed to 64 percent on Oct. 5, the highest level
since May 18, according to  Bloomberg data .  “The interaction between breadth and volume is
supportive,” Verrone said.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
