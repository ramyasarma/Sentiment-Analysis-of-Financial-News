German 10-year  bund yields  rose from
near the lowest in a month before the monthly U.S. payrolls
report as Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said the risk of a recession has “probably receded.”  Two-year notes were little changed. “The big issue has
been this soft patch this summer,” Bullard said in an interview
with CNBC. A double-dip “is something I don’t think we’ll
see.” The U.S.  jobless rate  rose to 9.7 percent from 9.6
percent in August, according to the median estimate of 83
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Germany’s trade balance
narrowed more than forecast in August as  exports  fell and
imports surged, government statistics showed.  “The market is so bullish at the moment that we need to
see more bad data to sustain it,” said  Luca Jellinek , head of
European interest-rate strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “Everyone’s waiting for the payrolls
data. Everything is riding on the Fed for the bond market.”  German 10-year yields were 4 basis points higher at 2.3
percent at 12:50 p.m. in London. The 2.25 percent security due
September 2020 fell 0.345, or 3.45 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,390)
face amount, to 99.535. Two-year yields were 1 basis point
higher at 0.81 percent.  Bund yields rose 4 basis points yesterday and European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled that he will
proceed with the gradual removal of emergency liquidity
provision. Today’s advance left bunds little changed in the
week, following a 6 basis-point drop in the previous week.  German-U.S. Spread  U.S. Treasury 10-year yields have dropped 10 basis points
this week, to 2.41 percent on speculation the Fed will renew so-
called quantitative easing. The decline narrowed the yield
spread with bunds to as little as 9.97 basis points, the least
since November according to closing prices.  Lower U.S. yields helped push the euro up against the
dollar, rising above $1.40 yesterday for the first time in eight
months. The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.3886 today.  The bonds of so-called peripheral euro-region nations were
little changed relative to benchmark German bunds. The Greek-
German 10-year yield spread was 2 basis point narrower at 753
basis points, while the  Irish-German spread  fell to 421 points
from 423. The Portuguese spread contracted 2 basis points to 399
points, while the Spanish spread was at 173 points from 177.  Greece’s cash deficit narrowed to 18.5 billion euros in the
nine months to the end of September from 25.6 billion euros in
the same period a year earlier, according to a statement from
the Athens-based Bank of Greece today.  Fitch Backs Portugal  Ordinary budget revenue rose to 36.2 billion euros from 35
billion euros a year earlier while ordinary budget spending fell
to 48.8 billion euros from 54 billion euros, according to the
statement.  Fitch Ratings considers the Portuguese government likely to
meet its budget deficit target for this year, Diario Economico
reported, citing Fitch Associate Director Douglas Renwick.  Meeting the budget deficit forecast for 2011 will depend on
whether the economy will be able to avoid a recession, the
Portuguese newspaper said, citing Renwick. Fitch is not
forecasting another recession as a “central scenario,” Renwick
said, according to Diario.  German bonds have returned 2.1 percent since June 30,
compared with 3.2 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 3.6 percent
for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
