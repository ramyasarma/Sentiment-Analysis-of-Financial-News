Gold Fields Ltd.  said the final order
book for its sale of $1 billion in bonds was twice
oversubscribed.  The South African producer of precious metals sold the
debt due in 10 years on Sept. 30 at a yield of 4.965 percent, or
245 basis points more than Treasuries of similar maturity,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 4.875 percent
coupon was the lowest by a South African company this year,
Johannesburg-based Gold Fields said today in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
