Turkey’s budget deficit narrowed in
September from a year earlier, according to preliminary data
from the Treasury.  The budget gap was 6.82 billion liras ($4.8 billion) from a
deficit of 12.85 billion liras in the same month last year, the
Treasury in Ankara said on its website today. Excluding interest
payments on debt, the budget produced a deficit of 3.76 billion
liras, compared to a deficit of 9.14 billion liras a year
earlier.  The Treasury figures are preliminary data that measure cash
inflows and outflows. The Finance Ministry will release full
budget numbers later this month.  The government may have room to accelerate spending in the
run-up to next year’s elections without breaching the target for
the budget deficit, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said Sept 21,
pointing to higher revenues as economic growth exceeds
forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
