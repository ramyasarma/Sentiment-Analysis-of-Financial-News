South Africa plans to build six
nuclear power plants by 2023 to deal with an energy shortage in
Africa’s biggest economy that has led to power rationing by
miners including  Anglo American Plc  and  BHP Billiton Ltd.   Each plant will produce “in the region of 1,600
megawatts,” Bheki Khumalo, spokesman for the Department of
Energy, said by mobile phone today. “These are indicative
figures” and the likely cost will be announced once the plans
have been approved by cabinet, Khumalo said.  South Africa is battling a power shortage after the
government halted expansion plans by state-owned electricity
utility Eskom Holdings Ltd. for four years until 2004 while it
tried and failed to convince privately owned companies to build
power plants. That resulted in a five-day shutdown of most mines
in the country in early 2008.  Eskom last year cut a five-year, 460 billion rand ($66.4
billion) expansion plan because of a lack of funding, while in
December 2008, South Africa halted plans to build a second, 12-
billion rand nuclear plant because of the global financial
crisis.  At the time, groups led by  Areva SA , the world’s largest
supplier of nuclear reactors, and Toshiba Corp.’s Westinghouse
Electric Co. were vying for the order to build the second plant.
Bultie Nel, managing director of Westinghouse South Africa,
wasn’t immediately available when Bloomberg News called seeking
comment.  Koeberg, South Africa’s only nuclear plant, started
operations in 1984 and is located about 30 kilometers (19 miles)
north of Cape Town in the Western Cape province.  The decision to build nuclear plants “must be finalized as
quickly as possible,” the Department of Energy said in a
summary of its Integrated Electricity Resources Plan.  South Africa is the world’s biggest platinum producer and
the third-largest miner of gold.  To contact the reporters on this story:
