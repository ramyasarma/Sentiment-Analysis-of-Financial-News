Qantas Airways Ltd.,  Australia’s
biggest airline, said attendants on a flight from Melbourne to
Hong Kong had to restrain a “disruptive” passenger with
handcuffs.  Hong Kong police met QF29, a Boeing 747, upon arrival
yesterday and took the passenger into custody, Sophia Connelly,
a spokeswoman for Sydney-based Qantas, said by telephone today.  “Our cabin crew were trained to deal with such a situation
and did so accordingly,” Connelly said. “The safety of
passengers was never in jeopardy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
