Russia may sell its first bonds
denominated in euros next year as the government seeks to set a
“benchmark” to help domestic companies borrow in the common
European currency, Deputy Finance Minister  Dmitry Pankin  said.  “As part of our debt strategy, we think it would be
appropriate,” Pankin told reporters in Washington, where he’s
attending the annual conference of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank.  Mexico’s recent success in selling so-called century notes
shows that “demand is high for long-term paper,” Pankin said.
“It would be interesting to take advantage of that.” Mexico
this week sold $1 billion of bonds due in 100 years in the
longest-maturity debt issued by a Latin American country.  Russia in April sold its first international bonds since
defaulting on domestic debt in 1998, raising $5.5 billion. If
the government decides to sell bonds in euros it may seek a
similar amount, though the priority continues to be selling
ruble debt to help cover the budget deficit, Pankin said.  Russia’s government is stepping up domestic borrowing to
help cover a 2010 fiscal shortfall forecast at 5.3 percent of
gross domestic product. The world’s biggest energy supplier
posted a deficit of 5.9 percent of GDP last year, its first
since 1999.  Russia borrowed a record 293 billion rubles ($9.7 billion)
in the third quarter and will seek to raise 300 billion rubles
in the last three months of this year to help finance its budget
deficit after the worst economic slump on record last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
