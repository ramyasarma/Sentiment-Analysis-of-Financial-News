Spy Anna Chapman showed up at the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to wave goodbye to a U.S.
astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts heading to the
International Space Station, the Associated Press reported.  Chapman, who has largely avoided the media since being
deported from the U.S. in July, was at the launch today as an
adviser to the president of FondServisBank, which works with
companies in the space industry, the AP said, citing an
unidentified official from Russian space agency Roscosmos. She
declined to speak to reporters.  NASA’s Scott Kelly and Russia’s Alexander Kaleri and Oleg
Skripochka are flying to the ISS on Russia’s first all-digital
Soyuz TMA-01M rocket, according to the news service.   To contact the reporter on this story:
