JSW Energy Ltd. , an affiliate of
India’s third-largest steelmaker, plans to double coal imports
to 6 million metric tons in the financial year starting April as
it expands power generation capacity.  The Mumbai-based utility plans to enter into long-term coal
contracts with suppliers and may also buy stakes in mines
overseas, Chief Executive Officer  Lalit Gupta  said in an
interview yesterday.  The company, which owns a coal mine in South Africa, plans
to quadruple output capacity at its Ratnagiri plant in western
India to 1,200 megawatts by March, Gupta said by telephone.  Indian generators increased coal imports by 16 percent to
44 million tons in the year ended March 2010 from a year earlier,
according to provisional figures from the nation’s  coal ministry .
Demand for the fuel is expected to more than triple to 2 billion
tons a year by 2030 in Asia’s second-fastest growing major
economy, where coal is used to fire more than half the current
installed capacity.  JSW Energy operates a 260 megawatt plant and a 600 megawatt
plant at Vijayanagar in the southern state of Karnataka, a 270
megawatt unit at Barmer in Rajasthan and a 300 megawatt project
at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra state, according to Gupta. The
utility is targeting generation capacity of 11,390 megawatts by
2015, according to its  website .  The company currently uses 2 million tons of coal for the
Vijayanagar plants and 1 million tons for Ratnagari, with most
of the fuel imported from South Africa and Indonesia, Gupta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
