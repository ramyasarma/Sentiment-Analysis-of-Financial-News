Taiwan’s central bank said it will
increase the interest rates it pays banks for money held in
reserve from Oct. 15 to reflect higher funding costs.  The interest the central bank pays on lenders’ reserves
that come from demand deposits will rise to 0.193 percent from
0.178 percent, while the rate for funds from time deposits will
climb to 0.934 percent from 0.855 percent,  the Central Bank of
the Republic of China (Taiwan)  said in a statement on its
website today.  The interest is paid on 55 percent of the lenders’
reserves, the central bank said.  The monetary authority increased its benchmark interest
rate for the second time this year on Sept. 30, after a jump in
home prices fueled concern the island’s economic recovery may
stoke a property bubble. Governor  Perng Fai-nan  and his board
raised the rate by 0.125 percentage point to 1.5 percent.  The average overnight interbank rate, a benchmark for the
money market, climbed to 0.221 percent today from 0.192 percent
on June 30, when the central bank last adjusted the interest
rates on reserves, according to Taipei Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
