Charles Antonucci , the former
president of Park Avenue Bank in Manhattan, pleaded guilty to
charges he lied to regulators and embezzled bank funds.  Antonucci, 59, told U.S. District Judge  Naomi Buchwald 
today that he lied to get more than $11 million in federal
bailout funds for the bank, took bribes and embezzled money and
participated in a scheme to defraud Oklahoma insurance
regulators in the $37.5 million sale of an insurer that was
later forced into receivership.  Prosecutors said Antonucci is the first person convicted of
trying to defraud the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program, which
was passed by Congress to prop up threatened banks. Antonucci
pleaded guilty to criminal counts including fraud, bribery,
embezzlement and conspiracy.  Antonucci, who was arrested in March, is free on $2 million
bail. He faces as much as 20 years in prison on the most serious
counts when he’s sentenced in April.  The case is U.S. v. Antonucci, 10-cr-507, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
