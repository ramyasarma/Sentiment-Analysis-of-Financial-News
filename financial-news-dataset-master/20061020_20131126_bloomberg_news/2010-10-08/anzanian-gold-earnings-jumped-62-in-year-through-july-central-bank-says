The value of gold exports from
Tanzania, Africa’s fourth-largest producer, jumped 62 percent in
the year through July because of increased output and a rally in
global prices of the metal, the  Bank of Tanzania  said.  The East African nation’s earnings from gold sales rose to
$1.37 billion in the 12 months to July 31, the Dar es Salaam-
based central bank said in a  report  on its website today.
Tanzania sold 38.1 metric tons of gold, 31 percent more than a
year earlier, the bank said.  The rise in gold output was partly due to the June 2009
start of production at  Barrick Gold Corp.’s  fourth mine in the
country, known as Buzwagi, the bank said. Earnings were also
helped by world gold prices, which climbed by more than a
quarter during the period, it said.  Tanzania is Africa’s largest gold producer after South
Africa, Ghana and Mali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
