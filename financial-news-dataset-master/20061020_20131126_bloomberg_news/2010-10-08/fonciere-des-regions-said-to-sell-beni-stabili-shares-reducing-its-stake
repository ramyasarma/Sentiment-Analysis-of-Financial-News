Fonciere des Regions SA is selling 23
million shares in Beni Stabili SpA in a placing managed by
Kempen & Co., according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  The sale would allow the French company to cut its stake to
below the 51 percent threshold, paving the way for Beni Stabili
to become a real-estate investment trust, said the person.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
