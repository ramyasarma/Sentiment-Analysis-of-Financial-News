Major League Baseball players,
umpires and officials will meet on Dec. 3 to discuss player-
umpire relations and may include expanded use of instant replay,
 ESPN reports .  The meeting was proposed by the MLB Players Association
after an increased number of complaints about umpires this
season according to the sports-cable network’s website, which
said it had obtained an e-mail detailing logistics for the
session.  Greg Bouris , the players union’s spokesman, declined to
comment on report. Brian Lam, chief negotiator for the World
Umpires Association, and major-league spokesman  Pat Courtney 
didn’t immediately return voice messages seeking comment.  There has been renewed support for expanded use of instant
replay this postseason. In the ninth inning of Game 1 of the
American League Divisional Series, New York Yankees outfielder
 Greg Golson  made a clean catch that was ruled a trap. Last
night, San Francisco Giants catcher  Buster Posey  was called safe
at second base on a fourth-inning steal attempt against the
Atlanta Braves. Replays showed that Posey was out. Three batters
later, Posey scored the game’s only run.  Baseball uses replay only to determine if balls clear the
outfield wall and are fair or foul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
