Manchester United  had an 83.6 million
pound ($133 million) fiscal-year loss as the team spent more on
staffing costs and didn’t recoup as much from the sale of
players.  The club had a profit of 25.6 million pounds last year,
when it benefited from the sale of  Cristiano Ronaldo  to Real
Madrid. Revenue rose 2.8 percent to a record 286 million pounds
in the 12 months ended June 30. The team announced the results
today in an e-mailed statement.  United sold Ronaldo for 80 million pounds in the 2009
offseason and didn’t make any major player purchases or sales
before this year’s campaign. While match-day revenue declined 8
percent to 100 million pounds, income from media and commercial
operations rose. Available cash increased 8.8 percent to 163.8
million pounds.  The team finished in second place last year, one point
behind Chelsea. After seven matches this season, United’s in
third place, five points behind Chelsea and a point behind
Manchester City.  To contact the reporter for this story:
