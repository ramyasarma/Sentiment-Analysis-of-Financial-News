China Vanke Co., the nation’s largest
publicly traded developer, dropped as much as 2.3 percent to
8.21 yuan in Shenzhen, leading declines by property developers,
after the Shanghai municipal government said it plans to rein in
the market by restricting new home purchases to one per
household.  Gemdale Corp dipped as much as 2.8 percent to 6.24 yuan and
Poly Real Estate Group Co. declined 3.1 percent to 11.98 yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
