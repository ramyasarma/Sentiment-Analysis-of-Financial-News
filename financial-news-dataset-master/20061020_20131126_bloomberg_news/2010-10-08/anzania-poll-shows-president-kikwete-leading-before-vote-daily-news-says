Tanzanian  President  Jakaya Kikwete 
leads opinion polls ahead of an election on Oct. 31, the  Daily
News  reported, citing a survey carried out by Research and
Education for Democracy of Tanzania.  Kikwete, the candidate of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi
party in this month’s vote, would have garnered 71 percent of
the votes had a general election been held last month, the Dar
es Salaam-based newspaper said. The East African nation’s six
opposition candidates would have jointly obtained 29 percent,
the newspaper said.  The number in favor of Kikwete dropped from 77 percent in a
poll conducted in March, it said, without providing a margin of
error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
