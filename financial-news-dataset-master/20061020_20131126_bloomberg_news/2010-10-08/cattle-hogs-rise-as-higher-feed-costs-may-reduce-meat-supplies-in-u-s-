Cattle futures jumped the most in 15
months on signs that higher costs for livestock feed will curb
U.S. meat output. Hog futures also gained.  Corn, used in animal rations, surged 6 percent on the
Chicago Board of Trade after the U.S. cut its harvest estimate.
Higher costs will mean reduced production of cattle, said
 Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar Commodity
Investments Co. in Minneapolis. Producers may feed animals less
grain, lowering weights, he said.  “For live cattle, the weights are already down pretty
hard,” Mayer said. “This would likely continue with higher
feed costs.”  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 1.775 cents, or
1.8 percent, to settle at 98.875 cents a pound at 2:08 p.m. on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the biggest gain for a most-
active contract since June 29, 2009. The commodity gained 0.5
percent this week and is up 15 percent this year.  The corn crop in the U.S. will be 3.8 percent smaller than
projected a month ago, the government said, citing lower Midwest
yields because of flooding in June and hot, dry weather in
August.  “We may see a more definitive shift toward lighter
cattle,” said  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught Futures Insights
in Altus, Arkansas. “That was what we saw in 2008 when corn
prices went to the moon.”  Corn futures reached a record $7.9925 a bushel on June 27,
2008, on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price closed today at
$5.2825.  Hogs Gain  Hog futures for December settlement gained 2.55 cents, or
3.6 percent, to 73.85 cents a pound, the biggest one-day
increase since March 29. The commodity advanced 1.3 percent this
week and has gained 13 percent this year.  “Cattle and hogs have got to go up simply because of the
corn market,” said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst at Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin. “The
general consensus is we need to keep prices up stronger to keep
people in business, with feed costs going through the roof.”  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement fell 1.325
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $1.0765 a pound, the fifth straight
decline. Prices dropped 4.1 percent this week and are down 12
percent for 2010.  Feeder cattle are young animals that weigh 500 pounds (227
kilograms) to 800 pounds. They are fattened in feedlots on corn
until they weigh about 1,200 pounds, and then sold to
meatpackers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
