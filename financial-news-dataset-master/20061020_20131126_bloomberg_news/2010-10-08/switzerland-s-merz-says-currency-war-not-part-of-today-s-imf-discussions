Swiss Finance Minister  Hans-Rudolf Merz  said the issue of a “currency war” wasn’t discussed by
International Monetary Fund officials at a meeting in Washington
today.  Asked whether currency wars were a topic, he said: “That
hasn’t played a role in today’s discussions.”  Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said Sept. 27 that
there’s already a worldwide “currency war.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
