Kenya Railways Corp., the state-owned
transport company, extended the deadline for expressions of
interest in the design of a standard-gauge railway line to Oct.
27 from June 25.  The company commented in a statement published in the
Nairobi-based Daily Nation newspaper today.  On May 17, Kenya Railways said it was seeking consultants
to design the railway line that will run from the port of
Mombasa, on  Kenya ’s eastern coastline, to Malaba on the Ugandan
border. The East African nation’s government said in September
2009 the planned railway would cost $4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
