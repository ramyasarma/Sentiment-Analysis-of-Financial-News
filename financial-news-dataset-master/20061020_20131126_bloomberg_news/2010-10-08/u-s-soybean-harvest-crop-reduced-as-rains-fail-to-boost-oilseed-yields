The U.S. soybean harvest may be 2.2
percent smaller than the month-ago forecast after August rains
failed to boost yields and the government reduced its acreage
estimates.  The crop will total a record 3.408 billion bushels (92.8
million metric tons), compared with 3.483 billion projected in
September and 3.359 billion gathered last year, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today in a report. The average
estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 3.501
billion bushels.  “There is not a shortage of soybeans in the U.S. or the
world,”  Anne Frick , a senior analyst for Prudential Bache
Commodities LLC in New York, said before the report. “We are
going to shift the focus to planting progress in South America,
where dry weather is a concern, and to the pace of U.S.
exports.”  Soybean futures have climbed 17 percent in the past year on
record Chinese purchases and reduced production in Russia and
parts of Europe. The November contract rose 3 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $10.65 a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  A bigger crop than last year would reduce feed costs for
livestock producers such as Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield
Foods Inc., and benefit oilseed processors including Archer
Daniels Midland Co. and Bunge Ltd. Co. The soybean crush spread
-- the value of the animal feed and cooking oil derived from a
bushel of soybeans, minus the cost of the oilseed -- has fallen
15 percent from a year ago.  Projected Yields  Yields are forecast at 44.4 bushels an acre, compared with
44.7 bushels projected in September and a record 44 bushels a
year ago. Analysts had projected a yield of 45 bushels.  About 76.823 million acres will be harvested, the USDA
said, down from 77.986 million estimated in September and up
from 76.372 million a year earlier. The department also lowered
its estimate for planted acreage to 77.7 million from 78.9
million.  Reserve supplies before next year’s harvest will total 265
million bushels, down from the September estimate of 350
million, the USDA said. The surplus on Aug. 31 was 151 million
bushels, up from 138 million a year earlier.  Cash prices will average $10.75 a bushel in the crop year
that began Sept. 1, up from last month’s estimate of $9.90 and
up from $9.59 in the previous year, the USDA said.  World production in the crop year that began Oct. 1 will
total 255.3 million metric tons, the USDA said, up from 254.9
million forecast a month ago. Output in the previous year was a
record 259.9 million tons.  World inventories next year before the North American
harvest are estimated at 61.4 million tons, down from 63.6
million forecast a month ago and up from 60.4 million on Sept.
