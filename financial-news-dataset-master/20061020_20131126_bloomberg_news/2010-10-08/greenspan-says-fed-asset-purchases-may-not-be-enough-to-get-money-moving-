Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said more asset purchases by the central bank may not
be enough to get “money moving” in the U.S. economy.  If the Fed increases “excess reserves and they just sit
there on the asset side of commercial banks’ balance sheets not
being relent, you’ve merely gone through an interesting
bookkeeping exercise,” Greenspan said today at a foreign-
exchange conference in New York sponsored by Bloomberg LP, the
parent of Bloomberg News.  “You’ve got to break that psychology that prevents that
current trillion” in reserves from being relent, said
Greenspan, a paid speaker at the event.  Greenspan, 84, was chairman of the Fed from 1987 until
2006, when he was succeeded by  Ben S. Bernanke .  To contact the reporters on this story:
