India’s wealthy may almost double
their assets over the next five years, as the world’s third-
fastest growing major economy boosts the country’s rich, Credit
Suisse Group AG said in its global wealth report.  While India’s wealth may rise 83 percent to $6.4 trillion
by 2015, only 0.4 percent of the nation’s adult population has
more than $100,000, the report showed. If the country’s economy
continues on its current trend, the rate of growth of this elite
group is expected to rise, Credit Suisse said.  The  International Monetary Fund  raised its 2010 economic
growth forecast for  India , citing strengthening local consumer
demand. The South Asian nation’s economy will expand 9.7 percent
this year, the Washington-based lender said in its World
Economic Outlook on Oct. 6, more than the 9.4 percent the IMF
estimated in July. The fund maintained its 2011 prediction for
India’s growth at 8.4 percent.  The proportion of Indian adults having wealth below $1,000
is roughly double the global average, the report showed. Wealth
is defined as the value of financial assets and non-financial
assets, primarily real estate, minus household debt.  China generates wealth at five times the pace of India,
 Credit Suisse  said. Total household wealth in China could more
than double to $35 trillion by 2015, outstripping Japan to
become the second highest in the world after the U.S., the
report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
