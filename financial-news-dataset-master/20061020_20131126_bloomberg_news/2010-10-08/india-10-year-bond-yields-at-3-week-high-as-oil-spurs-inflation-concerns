India’s 10-year  bonds  dropped,
pushing yields to the highest level in three weeks, on concern
rising oil prices will fuel inflation.  The wholesale price index increased 8.5 percent in
September, holding at the same level as August, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of 13 economists. The data is due on Oct.
14. Crude oil prices averaged $82 per barrel this week, compared
with $78.4 a barrel a week ago. India imports about 70 percent
of its oil and higher prices could force refiners to increase
gasoline and diesel prices.  “Crude price increase is inflationary in nature and may
prevent prices from cooling faster,” said  Sanjay Arya , a
treasurer at Bank of Maharashtra in Mumbai.  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose three
basis points to 7.98 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.24, or 24 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 98.78.  Inflation based on wholesale prices held above 10 percent
for four months since March. The central bank of India has
increased its interest rates five times this year. The
repurchase auction rate, at which it lends to banks, is at 6
percent.  The  finance ministry  sold 110 billion rupees ($2.5 billion)
of notes maturing in 2017, 2022 and 2040 today.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, rose four basis points to 6.66 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
