Mexico’s peso bond yields had the
biggest weekly decline since August on increased speculation the
Federal Reserve may ease monetary policy by buying more assets
after the U.S. reported worse-than-forecast payrolls data.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell 20
basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 6.31 percent since
Oct. 1, according to Banco Santander SA. The yield was the
lowest on record since the security was issued in 2005. The
price rose 2.19 centavos to 134.54 centavos per peso, at 5 p.m.
New York time. The yield declined three basis points today. The
weekly move was the biggest since the week ending Aug. 20.  “There is growing assurance that there will be
quantitative easing,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an economist with
Wells Fargo & Co. in New York. “This demand for yield is very
strong at this point. Emerging markets are going to see a
continued sustained move on this.”  U.S. employers cut 95,000 jobs in September, more than the
median estimate for a drop of 5,000 in a Bloomberg survey, the
Labor Department said today in Washington. The Fed said last
month it is prepared to ease monetary policy by buying assets to
bolster the U.S. economy, the biggest buyer of Mexican exports.  The peso rose 1.1 percent to 12.4142 per dollar, from
12.5505 yesterday, the strongest level since May 12. The
currency gained 0.9 percent this week.  Traders triggered $100 million of dollar options today, the
central bank said on its website. So far this month, $500
million in options have been exercised.  The bank has been auctioning $600 million in options
monthly, allowing it to purchase dollars as it seeks to boost
foreign reserves after the peso reached a record low last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
