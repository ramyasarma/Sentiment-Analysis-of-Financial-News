Cemex SAB , the largest cement maker
in the Americas, said it will acquire the interests of partner
Ready Mix USA LLC in two joint ventures for about $360 million.  The transaction, which is part of a put option by Ready Mix
USA, is expected to close in September 2011, Monterrey, Mexico-
based Cemex said in an e-mailed statement today. Cemex will take
on about $17 million of debt from one of the ventures, which
were created in 2005.  The joint venture operated by Cemex owns a cement plant in
Alabama with annual capacity of 0.9 million tons, a cement plant
in Georgia with 0.8 million tons of capacity and 12 cement
terminals, the company said. The joint venture operated by Ready
Mix USA owns 10 sand and gravel pits, 149 concrete plants and 20
concrete block makers in Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Alabama, Georgia and Florida.  Cemex’s American depositary shares  rose  11 cents to $8.38
today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have dropped 26 percent this year.  Cemex, which was forced to refinance $15 billion of debt
with its bankers last year to avoid default, has been selling
assets to repay  debt . In August, the company completed the sale
of seven aggregate quarries, three aggregate distribution
centers and a block plant for $90 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
