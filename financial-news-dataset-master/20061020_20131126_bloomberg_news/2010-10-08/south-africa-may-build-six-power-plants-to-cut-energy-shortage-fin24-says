South Africa will build six new power
plants to remedy an energy shortage in the continent’s biggest
economy,  Fin24  said, citing a report by the South African
Broadcasting Corp.  China, France and South Korea will assist in the
construction of the plants, the Johannesburg-based website said,
citing South Africa’s energy department Director General
 Nelisiwe Magubane  as saying.  The power plants are part of the government’s new energy
plan and will use “different technology,” Fin24 cited Magubane
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
