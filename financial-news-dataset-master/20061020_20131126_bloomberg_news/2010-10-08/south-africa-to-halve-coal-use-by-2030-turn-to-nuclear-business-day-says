South Africa’s government unveiled a
plan that calls for the country’s reliance on coal to be cut by
almost half by 2030 and for the use of nuclear energy to be more
than doubled, Business Day reported.  The 20-year electricity plan also proposes a
“significant” increase in the use of renewable energies, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing the Department of
Energy.  By 2030, coal is expected to contribute 48 percent to South
Africa’s energy output, renewable energy 16 percent and nuclear
14 percent, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
