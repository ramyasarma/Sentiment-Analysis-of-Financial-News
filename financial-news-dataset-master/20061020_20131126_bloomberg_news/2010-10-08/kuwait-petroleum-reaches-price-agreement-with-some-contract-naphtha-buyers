Kuwait Petroleum Corp., the biggest
Middle East exporter of oil products to Asia, reached a price
agreement with some buyers for its one-year naphtha supply
contract, two traders said today.  The state-owned company may sell its Full-Range naphtha at
$12 a metric ton over Middle East quotes and the Light grade at
a $13 premium, according to the bidders, who were involved in
the negotiations that started this week in Singapore. Not all
bidders for the December 2010 to November 2011 contract have
agreed on prices, they said.  Kuwait Petroleum  officials in Singapore and Tokyo couldn’t
be reached for comment. The company, which made an opening offer
at a premium of $15 a ton, supplies naphtha under one-year
contracts that begin in April, August and December.  Potential buyers, including traders and petrochemical
companies from Japan and South Korea, placed opening bids at
premiums near $9 a ton, the traders said.  Full-Range naphtha is sold under the current contract for
August 2010 to July 2011 at a $21 premium. Kuwait Petroleum is
offering Light grade under term sales for the first time, the
traders said.  Naphtha is used as feedstock to make petrochemicals or
gasoline. Kuwait is among 12 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps about 40 percent of
the world’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
