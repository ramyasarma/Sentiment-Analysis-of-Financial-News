             Treasury futures may rise to the
highest since February after climbing above so-called resistance
at 117 14/32, said MF Global Singapore, part of the world’s
largest broker of exchange-traded futures and options.  
 The contracts, which previous failed to break above that
level, rallied to touch 117 27/32 yesterday after Standard &
Poor’s downgraded Greece’s debt to junk. The ratings cut came as
European Union policy makers struggle to agree on measures to
ease the panic over swelling budget deficits. Futures will rise
in May toward the Feb. 26 high of 118 30/32, said Geoff Howie,
senior vice president at MF Global Singapore.  
 The contracts may “consolidate within a range defined by
support at 117 6/32 and resistance at 118 30/32,” Howie said.
The contracts may breach resistance in the event of
disagreements over “International Monetary Fund and EU aid and
its cost to Greece. It’s too early to say that the risks are
contained,” he said.  
 Ten-year futures contracts for June delivery traded at 117
17/32 today, for an implied yield of 3.87 percent, from 117
21/32 yesterday. The yield on the 3.625 percent note maturing in
February 2020 note was at 3.71 percent. Support is where buy
orders may be clustered and resistance is where sell orders may
be aggregated.
