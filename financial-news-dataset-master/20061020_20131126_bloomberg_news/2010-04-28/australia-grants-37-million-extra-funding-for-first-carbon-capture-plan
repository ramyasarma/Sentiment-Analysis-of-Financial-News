             Australia’s government will provide
an additional A$40 million ($37 million) for the nation’s first
carbon-capture project, Minister for Resources and Energy Martin
Ferguson said late yesterday.  
 The project will capture carbon dioxide emissions from the
Yallorn coal-fired power station in Victoria, southeastern
Australia, and convert the gas into minerals that can be used in
construction, Ferguson said in a statement on the ministry Web
site. The extra funding depends on the outcome of feasibility
studies, according to the statement.  
 The federal government and Victoria are already providing
A$3.5 million each for the project. Calera Corp., a California-
based carbon-capture company, is providing more than A$3.5
million, the statement said.  
 The project “will allow us to test the world’s first
carbonation process on brown coal to produce useful building
materials and reduce CO2 emissions from an existing coal-fired
power station at the same time,” Ferguson said.  
 The additional funding will come from the National Low
Emissions Coal Initiative, a government plan to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from coal, the statement said.
Australia gets about 75 percent of its electricity from coal,
according to official statistics.  
 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said yesterday the government
will shelve its carbon-trading plan because of opposition in
parliament and inaction by other nations.
