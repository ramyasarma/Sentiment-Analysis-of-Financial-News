             -- Macarthur Coal Ltd., subject of
a A$4.1 billion ($3.8 billion) takeover offer from Peabody
Energy Corp., said it hasn’t had any recent communication from
Noble Group Ltd. after the Australian Financial Review reported
the Hong Kong-based company may be preparing a new approach.  
 “We haven’t received anything from Noble,” Genevieve
Fraser, a spokeswoman for Brisbane-based Macarthur, said today.
An approach may come as early as this week, the Financial Review
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 Noble shareholders this month rejected a proposal that
would have seen the company become Macarthur’s biggest
shareholder. Macarthur is allowing Peabody, the largest U.S.
coal producer, to study its finances until May 3.  
 Macarthur’s shares fell 0.6 percent to A$15.95 at 12:24 p.m.
Sydney time on the Australian stock exchange. Peabody has
offered A$16 a share.
