             China will impose a temporary
tariff on U.S. chicken product imports from April 30, the
Ministry of Commerce said on its Web site today.  
 An initial investigation by the ministry showed that the
U.S. subsidizes its chicken industry, hurting Chinese producers,
according to the statement.
