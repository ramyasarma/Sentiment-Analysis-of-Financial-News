             Toyota Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor
Corp. fell the most in more than two months, leading declines by
carmakers in Tokyo after the yen gained against most major
currencies, reducing the value of their overseas earnings.  
 Toyota, the nation’s biggest automaker, dropped as much as
3 percent, the most since Feb. 15, to 3,585 yen and was down 1.9
percent at 3,625 yen as of the 11 a.m. trading break. Mazda
Motor Corp. fell 2.8 percent.  
 Concern that debt problems will spread after Standard &
Poor’s lowered Greece’s debt to junk and cut Portugal’s rating
caused the yen to rally against the dollar and euro, as the
crisis curbed demand for riskier, higher-yielding assets.
Toyota’s operating profit is reduced by 35 billion yen ($376
million) for each 1-yen strengthening of Japan’s currency
against the dollar, the company said in February.  
 “This is almost a Pavlovian market response to sell
carmakers with large exposures to Europe, especially Mazda,”
said Mitsuo Shimizu, an analyst at Cosmo Securities Co. in Tokyo.  
 The euro was at $1.3178 as of 9:32 a.m. in Tokyo, after
earlier dropping to $1.3145, the weakest since April 29, 2009.
Sales in Europe made up 21 percent of Hiroshima, Japan-based
Mazda’s revenue in the quarter ended March 31.  
 Mazda exports about 80 percent of domestic production and
aims to increase the ratio to 85 percent by fiscal year 2016,
President Takashi Yamanouchi said yesterday in Tokyo.  
 Toyota vs. Euro  
 Toyota estimates a 1-yen rise against the euro cuts its
operating profit by 5 billion yen, the Toyota City, Japan-based
carmaker said in February. The company earned 11 percent of
revenue in Europe in the quarter ended Dec. 31.  
 The yen gained to as much as 93 versus the dollar in Tokyo
trading today, from 93.26 at the close in New York yesterday.
Japan’s currency reached a seven-month low of 94.79 on April 5.  
 Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest carmaker, fell 1.8
percent to 3,275 yen. The Tokyo-based company estimates
operating profit is reduced by 12 billion yen for every 1-yen
strengthening against the dollar and 1.5 billion yen for a
corresponding gain against the euro.  
 Paul Nolasco, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Toyota, and Akemi
Ando, a spokeswoman for Honda, declined to comment.  
 Honda will report earnings for the fiscal year ended March
31 at 3 p.m. today. Toyota will report its results on May 11.
