             Renhe Commercial Holdings Co., a
developer of underground shopping malls in China, plans to start
marketing a sale of bonds denominated in U.S. dollars this week,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  
 Renhe will meet bond investors in Hong Kong, Singapore,
London, Boston and New York, said the person, who declined to be
identified before a public announcement. The Harbin, China-based
company hired Bank of America Corp., Bank of China Ltd.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG to manage the sale, according to
a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.
