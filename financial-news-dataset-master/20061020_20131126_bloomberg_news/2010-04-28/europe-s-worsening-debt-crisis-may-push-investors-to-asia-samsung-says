             Europe’s worsening debt crisis may
prompt investors to reroute capital to Asian emerging markets,
according to Samsung Securities Co.  
 Emerging Asia “may benefit from money inflows searching
for relatively safer assets,” Choi Seok Won, head of fixed-
income research for Samsung, said in a telephone interview from
Seoul today.  
 Greece’s credit rating was cut three steps to the junk BB+
tier by Standard & Poor’s yesterday, the first time a euro
member has lost investment-grade status since the common
currency’s 1999 debut. The downgrade came after Moody’s
Investors Service increased South Korea’s rating to A1 from A2
on April 14 as the central bank raised its 2010 economic
forecast and unemployment fell the most in a decade.  
 Junk or high-yield bonds are rated Ba1 and lower by Moody’s
or BB+ and below by S&P.  
 The cost of protecting Asian bonds from default surged to
the highest in two months today after S&P downgraded Greece and
reduced Portugal by two steps to A- from A+.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of credit-default swaps on 50
investment-grade borrowers outside Japan jumped 10 basis points
to 110.5 basis points as of 7:50 a.m. in Singapore, its highest
since Feb. 26, according to Deutsche Bank AG and CMA DataVision
in New York.  
 While Asia is better placed than Europe to weather the
sovereign downgrades, there’s some danger “systemic risk can
spur investment withdrawal from the markets,” Choi said.
