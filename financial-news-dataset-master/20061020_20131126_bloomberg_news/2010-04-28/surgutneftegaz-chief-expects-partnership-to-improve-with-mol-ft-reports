             Vladimir Bogdanov, general director
of Surgutneftegaz, said he hopes to establish “a partnership”
with Mol Hungarian Oil and Gas NyRt, noting that there is 
movement “in the right direction” after the election of a new
government in Hungary, the Financial Times reported.  
 While Surgut acquired a 21.2 percent stake in Mol last 
year, it has received a poor reception by Mol and has yet to 
secure voting rights for the Hungarian company’s annual meeting
on April 29, the FT said. Zsolt Hernadi, Mol’s executive 
chairman, has rejected holding talks with Surgut about 
cooperation, saying that the Russian oil and gas company has 
not made its intentions clear, the FT said.
