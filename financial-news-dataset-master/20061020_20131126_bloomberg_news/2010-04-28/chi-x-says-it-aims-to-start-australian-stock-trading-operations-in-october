             Chi-X Global Inc., an electronic-
trading-platform provider, is aiming to start operating in
Australia by October.  
 “The target is to launch in October,” Peter Fowler,
chief operating officer of Chi-X Australia Pty., said in an
interview in Sydney ahead of a media event today. Chi-X last
month won preliminary government approval to open Australia’s
first rival to stock-exchange operator ASX Ltd.  
 Australia’s Senate paved the way for rival exchanges when
it voted in March to hand oversight of real-time trading on
licensed markets to the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission, replacing self-regulation that allowed ASX to
supervise the nation’s main stock exchange.  
 Chi-X was the first so-called multilateral trading facility
to challenge traditional bourses, including Deutsche Boerse AG,
London Stock Exchange Group Plc and NYSE Euronext, by offering
lower fees and faster trading. Chi-X Global, a holding company
for the regional units, is owned by Instinet LLC, a subsidiary
of Nomura Holdings Inc.  
 “We have to wait until ASIC releases its updated market
integrity rules,” Fowler said. “We’ll then modify our draft
rules and present them to ASIC.  
 ‘‘Clearing and settlement issues are also being negotiated
with the ASX. ASIC will then make a recommendation to the
minister and he will issue us with a license.’’  
 Chi-X Japan KK said on April 5 that it will begin selling
trading services in Japan by about July to capture a slice of
the world’s second-largest stock market.
