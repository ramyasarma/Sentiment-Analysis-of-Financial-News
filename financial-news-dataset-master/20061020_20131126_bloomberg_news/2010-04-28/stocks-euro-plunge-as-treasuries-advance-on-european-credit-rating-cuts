             Stocks worldwide tumbled and the
cost to insure against losses in corporate debt increased after
credit rating downgrades of Greece and Portugal fueled concern
debt-laden nations are moving closer to default. The euro traded
near a one-year low versus the dollar.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 1.6 percent to 125.12
at 11:43 a.m. in Tokyo after U.S. stocks had the biggest decline
since February. The cost of protecting Asian bonds from default
surged to the highest in two months. The euro was at $1.3207,
after earlier dropping to $1.3145, the least since April 29,
2009, Standard & Poor’s 500 index futures were little changed.  
 S&P lowered Greek debt to junk and Portugal was cut two
steps as contagion from Greece’s debt crisis spreads through the
euro region. The downgrades come as German policy makers insist
Greece must outline further steps to cut its budget deficit
before they will endorse the release of funds from a 45 billion
euro ($60 billion) rescue package. European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet and International Monetary Fund
Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn will meet German political
leaders in Berlin today to promote the financial assistance plan.  
 “People are panicking about the contagion effect,” said
Sydney-based Simon Bonouvrie, who helps manage $1.7 billion at
Platypus Asset Management. “It’s an overreaction but the risk
aversion will remain until these problems are resolved.”  
 Credit-default swaps on European sovereign debt surged to
records. Contracts tied to Greek government bonds climbed 111
basis points to 821, according to CMA DataVision. Portugal rose
54 basis points to 365. Yields on 10-year Treasuries tumbled 12
basis points to 3.68 percent. Greek two-year note yields soared
to almost 19 percent and Portugal’s jumped to 5.7 percent.  
 Stocks Skid  
 All 10 of the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s industry groups
fell. The MSCI World Index lost 0.5 percent, extending
yesterday’s 2.1 percent decline. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock
Average slumped 2.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi dropped 1.3
percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index sank 1.6 percent.  
 Finance companies as a group were the biggest drag on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index amid mounting credit concerns. HSBC
Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest lender, lost 2.3 percent to
HK$79.60 in Hong Kong. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
which derives about 5 percent of its revenue from Europe and the
Middle East, dropped 2.2 percent to 498 yen.  
 Billabong International Ltd., an Australian surfwear maker
that gets 23 percent of its revenue in Europe, sank 2 percent to
A$11.56. LG Display Co., which got 18 percent of its 2009 sales
from Europe, declined 2 percent to 44,300 in Seoul.  
 Exporters Slide  
 Japanese exporters fell as a stronger yen threatened to
hurt the value of overseas income. The yen appreciated to 122.37
against the euro today from 125.62 at the 3 p.m. close of stock
trading in Tokyo yesterday. The yen strengthened to 92.82
against the dollar from 93.94.  
 Canon Inc., a camera maker that counts Europe as its
largest market, slumped 2.7 percent to 4,265 yen. Toyota Motor
Corp., which gets 10 percent of its revenue in Europe, fell 2.2
percent to 3,615 yen.  
 A gauge of material producers in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index sank 1.9 percent, the most of 10 industry groups, after
the London Metal Exchange Index of six industrial metals tumbled
4.6 percent, the most since June 22. Crude oil dropped to $82.44
a barrel, the lowest settlement price since April 19.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s No. 1 mining company, fell
2.4 percent to A$40.98, while Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
third-largest mining company, declined 2.6 percent to A$74.40.
Mitsubishi Corp., which trades commodities, lost 1.8 percent to
2,260 yen in Tokyo.  
 Asia Bond Risk  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of credit-default swaps on 50
investment-grade borrowers outside Japan jumped 10 basis points
to 110.5 basis points as of 7:50 a.m. in Singapore, its highest
since Feb. 26, according to Deutsche Bank AG and CMA DataVision
in New York.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 10 basis points to
98 as of 9:06 a.m. in Sydney, the highest since Feb. 19,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc. and CMA.  
 The Markit iTraxx Japan index jumped 8 basis points to 106
as of 9:09 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Morgan Stanley. That’s
the biggest jump since Feb. 5 and puts the index on track for
its highest close since April 1, according to CMA.  
 The euro earlier dropped to $1.3145, the least since April
29, 2009, from $1.3175 in New York yesterday. The 16-nation
currency traded at 122.87 yen from 122.88 yen and touched 122.37
yen, the weakest since March 25.  
 Euro Test  
 “With sovereign problems showing signs of contagion, the
euro is losing its allure as an alternative currency to the
dollar,” said Akio Yoshino, chief economist in Tokyo at Societe
Generale Asset Management (Japan) Inc. “The currency may test
the $1.30 mark sooner rather than later.”  
 The S&P 500 lost 2.3 percent yesterday in New York. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 3.1 percent, the most since November,
and the euro dropped below $1.32 for the first time since April
2009. Financial shares led U.S. stocks lower as the Senate’s
interrogation of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives spurred
concern of tighter regulation.  
 Yields on 10-year Portuguese bonds jumped 48 basis points
to 5.69 percent and Irish 10-year yields surged 19 basis points
to 5.10 percent. Japan’s bonds advanced, pushing 10-year yields
to the lowest level in four months. The yield fell 2.5 basis
points to 1.28 percent.  
 Ratings Downgrades  
 S&P lowered Greece’s credit rating to BB+ from BBB+ and
warned that bondholders could recover as little as 30 percent of
their initial investment if the country restructures its debt.
The downgraded marked the first time a euro member has lost
investment grade rating since the currency’s 1999 debut. S&P
also reduced Portugal by two steps to A- from A+.  
 Greece said the downgrade of its rating by S&P doesn’t
reflect the “real facts” of the economy, according to an e-
mail from the country’s finance ministry.  
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said yesterday she won’t
release funds to help Greece shore up its finances until the
nation has a “sustainable” plan to reduce its budget deficit.
Germany’s Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said Greece needs to
present a plan to overcome its debt crisis as soon as possible.
