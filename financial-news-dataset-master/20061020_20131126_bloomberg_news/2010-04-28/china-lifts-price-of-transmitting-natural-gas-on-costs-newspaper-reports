             China has raised the price of
transmitting natural gas because of higher costs of production,
the South China Morning Post said, citing an official at the
Guangdong Oil and Gas Association.  
 Gas transmission fees were increased by 8 fen per cubic
meter in some southwestern and northeastern regions on Monday,
said Kevin Zhuang Rongjin, an official at the Guangdong Oil and
Gas Association, according to the report.
