             Two bright stars, Norbert Leo Butz
as  Jeffrey Skilling  and  Marin Mazzie  as his fictional nemesis,
Claudia Roe, illuminate the Broadway production of the London
hit, “ Enron .”  
 Even better, there are two fascinating plays in it, for two
kinds of theatergoers.  
 It is a satirical drama about the collapse of the corrupt
Texas energy giant, and what could be more satisfying than
watching an evil ogre bite the well-deserved dust in what was,
in 2001, the biggest collapse in our history?  
 The semi-factual drama by  Lucy Prebble  (28 when she wrote
it) will appeal to those familiar with the case and
knowledgeable of the most esoteric aspects of accounting. The
rest of us, lacking total comprehension, can revel in the racy
dialogue, remarkable visuals and frequent humor delivered by a
virtuosic ensemble.  
 I can’t say where actual quotation and verifiable fact
commingle with the author’s lively imagination. Nevertheless,
Prebble’s writing and the production dreamed up by director
Rupert Goold are stunning enough to provide steady wonder,
involvement and delight.  
 Rodents  
 Enron’s benighted board appears, most entertainingly, as a
trio of giant blind mice. A quartet of raptors with beady eyes
appears courtesy of chief financial officer  Andy Fastow  in a
losing battle to devour Enron’s mountains of debt. The Lehman
Brothers are just that: nerdy twins in one oversize jacket,
squeaking and behaving smarmily in imperfect unison. Traders,
stock analysts and lawyers arrange themselves into a cacophonous
chorus line inspired by Adam Cork’s peppy music and Scott
Ambler’s choreography.  
 The set by Anthony Ward and Mark Henderson’s lighting
suggest the boldest science fiction -- which is just what the
Enron case calls for: the strangeness of fiction and the crooked
science of a larger-than-life swindle.  
 As Skilling, Butz gives the performances of two lifetimes.
One part is a cool scoundrel of the most thoroughgoing
duplicity, the other is the good father and boy genius afloat on
the childlike glee of his own Machiavellianism.  
 You feel for him when he declares “If your executives
aren’t waking up at four, their hearts beating out of their
chest, they’re not doing their job,” and almost believe him
when he states, “The only difference between me and the people
judging me is they weren’t smart enough to do what we did.”  
 Model Mover  
 As Fastow, Stephen Kunken gives a similarly textured
performance. Mazzie as Skilling’s defeated competitor on the
corporate ladder is the model of a mover on the make who meets
her match in Skilling. Gregory Itzin is sheer mendacious
Southern charm as the sanctimonious, pathetic chairman  Kenneth Lay .  
 “Enron” is at once an astonishing thrill ride through the
high-flying ‘90s and a chilling precursor to everything that
would follow.
