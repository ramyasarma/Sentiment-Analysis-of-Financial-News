             Japan’s retail sales rose at the
fastest pace in 13 years, adding to evidence that the nation’s
export-led recovery is benefiting consumers.  
 Sales advanced 4.7 percent from a year earlier, the Trade
Ministry said today in Tokyo. The median forecast of 15
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 3.6 percent gain.  
 Accelerating growth overseas has revived Japan’s exports
and factory output, bolstering paychecks and stabilizing
unemployment. The gains are supporting the consumer spending
rebound, helping offset price declines that threaten to curb
growth in the world’s second-largest economy.  
 “Consumers are moving away from a crisis mentality,” said
Masamichi Adachi, a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in
Tokyo. “This doesn’t mean we’ll have a recovery driven by
consumer spending, but the recent data has been relatively
strong.”  
 Today’s advance was the largest since March 1997, a month
before Japan raised the consumption tax to 5 percent from 3
percent. Higher demand for cars, machinery and clothes
contributed to the gains, the government said.  
 Seven & I Holdings Co. and Fast Retailing Co., the nation’s
biggest retailers by market value, this month raised their
profit forecasts on increased demand.  
 Revenue rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent from the
previous month, today’s report showed. Economists say reports
due April 30 will show workers’ prospects are getting brighter.  
 Job Ratio Improves  
 The ratio of job openings to applicants probably improved
for a third month in March, according to the median estimate of
28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The unemployment rate
may stay at 4.9 percent, compared with July’s postwar high of
5.6 percent, analysts surveyed said.  
 Household confidence surged to the highest level since 2007
last month, led by a gain in sentiment about jobs.  
 Even so, the economic recovery has yet to end deflation,
which the central bank has said is a “critical challenge.”
Consumer prices excluding fresh food declined 1.2 percent in
March, a 13th straight drop, according to the median estimate of
28 economists surveyed ahead of a report also due April 30.  
 Yoshinoya Holdings Co., the restaurant chain that serves
300 yen ($3) bowls of rice with stewed beef, swung to a net loss
of 8.94 billion yen from a profit a year ago. Consumer frugality
has prompted businesses to cut prices, intensifying competition
for customers, the company said this month.  
 Household outlays on services continued to drop in the
fourth quarter while those on durable goods surged 9 percent,
government data show, an indication that spending patterns
remain uneven. Government incentives have encouraged consumers
to buy energy-efficient cars and electronics. Some of those
programs will expire this year.
