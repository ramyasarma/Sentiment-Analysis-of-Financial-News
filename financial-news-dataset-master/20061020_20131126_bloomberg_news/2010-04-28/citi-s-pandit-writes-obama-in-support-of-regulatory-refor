             Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive
Officer Vikram Pandit wrote President Barack Obama
endorsing “strong regulatory reform” for U.S. banks, saying it
would restore trust and confidence in the financial system.  
 “I have been a firm advocate of strong regulatory
reform,” Pandit said in the letter to Obama obtained by
Bloomberg News. “You can count on me and the entire Citi
organization to support” overhaul efforts.  
 The letter was dated April 23, a day after Obama’s speech
in New York in which the president challenged the financial
industry to join the effort to revamp market regulations and
said what happens on Wall Street has consequences throughout the
nation.  
 Pandit’s letter was reported earlier by Politico.  
 “I believe banks should not speculate with their
capital,” that “derivatives should be cleared and settled
centrally” and that there needs to be “a strong federal
consumer authority to protect consumer interests,” Pandit
wrote.  
 “Citi has long called for prudent and thoughtful reform of
the financial regulatory system, and the letter sent to
President Obama is consistent with our March 4 testimony before
the Congressional Oversight Panel,” said Molly Millerwise
Meiners, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank.  
 A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the administration didn’t solicit the letter of support.  
 Obama is pushing to get the new regulations through
Congress. In the Senate today, Republicans refused for a second
time to let Democrats start floor debate on the Wall Street
legislation.  
 Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank, repaid in December
$20 billion of the bailout funds it received from the
government. The rest was converted into a 27 percent U.S. stake,
which the government plans to start selling, according to a
registration statement filed yesterday.
