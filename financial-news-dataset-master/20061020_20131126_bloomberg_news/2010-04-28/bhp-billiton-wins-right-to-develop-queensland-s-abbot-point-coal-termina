             BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
largest mining company, has won preferred developer status for
the construction of a coal terminal at Abbot Point port in
Australia’s Queensland state.  
 The terminal will have an initial capacity of 30 million
metric tons a year, North Queensland Bulk Ports Corp. Chairman
Leonie Taylor said in a statement today. Hancock Coal Pty has
gained developer status for a separate export facility at the
port, Taylor said.  
 Abbot Point, 25 kilometers (16 miles) north of the town of
Bowen, has one terminal and is being expanded to increase
capacity to 50 million tons of steelmaking and power-station
coal annually in 2011. Talks will now start with the Queensland
state government to negotiate development arrangements,
Melbourne-based spokeswoman for BHP Amanda Buckley said in a
separate statement.  
 “The new Abbot Point coal terminal is a key element in our
growth plans,” Hubie van Dalsen, president of BHP Billiton
metallurgical coal, said in an e-mailed statement.  
 Abbot Point exported 14.4 million tons in 2008 and 2009,
and handled 176 ships during that period, according to the
North Queensland Bulk Ports Corp Web site.
