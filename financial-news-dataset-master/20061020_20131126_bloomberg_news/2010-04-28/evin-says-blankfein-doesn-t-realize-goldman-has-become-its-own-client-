             Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan
Democrat leading hearings into Goldman Sachs Group Inc., told
the firm’s chief executive officer he is “troubled” that the
company doesn’t seem to understand conflicts of interest.  
 “You can make sure that someone you sell an investment to
knows that you believe it’s a bad investment,” Levin said to
CEO Lloyd Blankfein at the hearing today in Washington. “You
obviously don’t see that, it troubles me that you don’t see
that.”  
 “It troubles me that you don’t see that your client is
yourself, Goldman Sachs has turned itself into its own client,”
Levin said.
