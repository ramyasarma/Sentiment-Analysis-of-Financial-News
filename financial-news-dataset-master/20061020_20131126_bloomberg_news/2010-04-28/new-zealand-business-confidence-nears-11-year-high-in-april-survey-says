             New Zealand business confidence
rebounded in April, adding to signs of an acceleration in
economic growth.  
 A net 43 percent of companies surveyed expect sales and
profits will increase over the next 12 months, up from 38.6
percent in March, according to a survey by ANZ National Bank
Ltd. released in Wellington today. The net figure subtracts the
number of pessimists from the number of optimists.
