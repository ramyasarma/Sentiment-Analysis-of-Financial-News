             Hong Kong’s benchmark stock index
fell to a five-week low after credit-rating downgrades of Greece
and Portugal, and as China signaled further policy measures to
cool its property market.  
 Esprit Holdings Ltd., which makes 84 percent of its revenue
in Europe, dropped 2.7 percent. China Resources Land Ltd., a
state-controlled developer, slid 1 percent. Wheelock Properties
Ltd. soared 135 percent after parent Wheelock & Co. offered to
pay HK$6.9 billion ($889 million) to buy the unit. Wheelock &
Co., controlled by billionaire Peter Woo, declined 1.1 percent.  
 “The credit crunch may become even more exacerbated, which
will impact the recovery in the region,” said Lei Wang, a
portfolio manager of Thornburg International Value Fund, which
oversees more than $20 billion. “From an investment prospective,
I avoid sectors for which income streams will deteriorate under
those austerity programs.”  
 The Hang Seng Index dropped 1.4 percent to 20,969.99 as of
11:28 a.m. local time, set for its lowest close since March 25.  
 The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the so-
called H shares of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies, decreased
1.5 percent to 11,994.38.  
 Shares on the Hang Seng Index are priced at an average 13.9
times estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov. 16 when the
index closed at its highest level for 2009, according to
Bloomberg data. Concern that budget deficits in Europe may
derail the global recovery and speculation China’s government
will tighten money supply have contributed to a 8.6 percent drop
in the Hang Seng from its November high.  
 Esprit, HSBC Slip  
 Esprit dropped 2.7 percent to HK$57.40, the largest decline
on the Hang Seng Index. HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest
lender, fell 2.1 percent to HK$79.75.  
 Greece’s credit rating was cut three steps to junk by
Standard and Poor’s, the first time a euro member has lost its
investment grade since the currency’s 1999 debut. The ratings
company also warned that bondholders could recover as little as
30 percent of their initial investment if the country
restructures its debt. S&P reduced Portugal by two steps to A-.  
 China Resources Land slid 1 percent to HK$13.92. Hang Lung
Properties Ltd., a developer that generated 40 percent of its
fiscal 2009 revenue in China, declined 1 percent to HK$28.90.  
 China’s recent efforts to cool its property market are
“just the beginning,” the China Daily newspaper said in an
editorial today.  
 Beijing will issue policies today limiting how many homes
residents of the Chinese capital are allowed to buy, the
Shanghai Securities News reported, citing an unidentified person.  
 Developer Fund Raising  
 A halt on share sales by Chinese developers may affect 45
companies with plans to raise as much as 110 billion yuan ($16
billion), the China Daily reported, citing an unidentified
source close to the China Securities Regulatory Commission.  
 Wheelock Properties soared 135 percent to HK$12.52. Parent
Wheelock agreed to pay HK$13 in cash for each share in the unit,
a 144 percent premium above its closing price on April 16, the
company said. Wheelock declined 1.1 percent to HK$23.10.  
 PetroChina Co. dropped 1.7 percent to HK$8.95 as crude
prices retreated for a third straight day, even after Asia’s
biggest company by market value posted a 71 percent jump in
first-quarter profit, beating analyst estimate.  
 Hang Seng Index futures fell 1.2 percent to 21,012. All but
three stocks fell among the gauge’s 43 constituents.
