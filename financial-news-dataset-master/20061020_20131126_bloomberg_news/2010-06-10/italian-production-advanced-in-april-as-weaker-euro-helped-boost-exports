             Italian industrial output rose more
than economists forecast in May as a weaker euro and a global
economic recovery boosted  exports .  
 Production  climbed 1 percent from April, when it rose a
revised 0.9 percent, Rome-based  statistics office Istat  said
today. Economists had forecast a 0.8 percent increase, according
to the median of 19 estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey .  
 The International Monetary Fund on July 8 raised its
forecast for global economic growth to 4.6 percent for this year
and kept its prediction for the euro region at 1 percent.
Greece’s near default and the spread of the sovereign debt
crisis has led to an 11 percent decline in the euro this year,
making European goods cheaper abroad as economies strengthen.  
 Europe’s debt crisis has prompted governments, including
Italy’s, to adopt austerity measures to try to trim budget
deficits, threatening to crimp Europe’s recovery. Italian
business confidence fell in June from almost a two-year high and
consumer optimism declined to the lowest in 16 months.  
 Italian industrial production gained 7.3 percent in May
from a year earlier, Istat said today. Istat originally reported
a 1 percent increase in monthly production in April.
