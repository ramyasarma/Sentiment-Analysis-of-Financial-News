             (Corrects story published on June 11 to fix the market
value lost in second paragraph.)  
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission’s plan to impose halts on stocks that swing more than
10 percent may be followed by more measures to slow trading.  
 The circuit-breaker test, a response to the May 6 plunge
that wiped out $862 billion of share value in 20 minutes, began
as a pilot covering five stocks and is scheduled to expand next
week. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said yesterday the agency is
considering regulating the speed of stock orders as part of a
broader effort to rein in electronic markets.  
 Regulators are under pressure from investors and lawmakers
to show they have a grip on markets increasingly dominated by
computers trading thousands of shares in less than a second.
Different rules on as many as 50 American equity venues helped
exacerbate the May 6 selloff as some platforms were overwhelmed
with electronic instructions to sell shares.  
 The SEC needs “to explore whether bids and orders should
be regulated on speed so there is less incentive to engage in
this microsecond arms race that might undermine long-term
investors and the market’s capital-formation function,”
Schapiro said yesterday at a conference in Montreal. “The
markets have to serve that function for companies to raise
money, create jobs and allow the economy to grow.”  
 Five Minutes  
 The circuit-breaker test, scheduled to last through Dec.
10, will pause trading for five minutes when a company rises or
falls 10 percent in five minutes or less. The curbs apply
between 9:45 a.m. and 3:45 p.m. New York time. The New York
Stock Exchange began implementing them today after delaying the
program last week.  
 NYSE Euronext said five stocks -- EOG Resources Inc.,
Genuine Parts Co., Harley-Davidson Inc., Ryder System Inc. and
Zimmer Holdings Inc. -- will be covered by the halts today,
according to a statement on its website. The remaining 399
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies that NYSE lists will be
subject to the rules by June 16 -- with 54 on June 14, 172 more
on June 15 and the final 173 the final day, the exchange said.  
 Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. will activate the program with all of
its S&P 500 stocks on June 14, spokesman Robert Madden said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday.  
 As many as 250 exchange-traded funds will also be added to
the pilot, according to James Ross of State Street Global
Advisors, the second-biggest manager of ETFs. Ross, a senior
managing director at the firm, spoke in an interview from New
York, citing industry discussions with the SEC. John Heine, an
SEC spokesman, declined to comment.  
 Dark Pools  
 Schapiro, speaking at an International Organization of
Securities Commissions event yesterday, said the SEC is
examining whether electronic venues known as dark pools, which
don’t display public quotes, are preventing stocks from trading
at their appropriate prices.  
 “We are also looking at whether and to what extent pre-
trade price discovery is impaired by the diversion of desirable,
marketable order flow from public markets to dark pools,” she
said.  
 The SEC proposed rules in October that would limit the
ability of dark pools to seek new orders to match existing ones
without displaying prices. The agency is also considering
eliminating flash orders, or pricing data shown a split-second
early to a segment of market participants.  
 ETF Trading  
 BlackRock Inc. in New York and Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-
based Vanguard Group Inc. said ETFs, which made up 70 percent of
securities with trades on May 6 that were later canceled because
of excessive declines, shouldn’t be omitted from the circuit-
breaker pilot. Vanguard’s mutual funds had $1.42 trillion in
assets as of March 31, while BlackRock’s had $3.36 trillion,
making it the world’s biggest money manager.  
 Schapiro has pledged to increase the scope of the pilot to
“thousands” of additional public companies.  
 “BlackRock has been informed by a number of large
liquidity providers that when the steep decrease in U.S. equity
values neared 10 percent -- a level specified as a ‘reference’
in exchange erroneous trade rules -- the liquidity providers
steeply discounted or ceased their bids for ETFs,” the firm
said in a June 2 letter to the SEC. Companies “pulled back from
bidding for shares of ETFs that owned high percentages of stocks
perceived as vulnerable to cancellations,” BlackRock said.  
 The SEC said in a joint report with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission on May 18 that ETFs were the securities most
affected by the May 6 plunge. ETFs, whose price is based on the
value of the shares they include, declined because the price of
underlying stocks decreased. The inability of market makers to
hedge their trades on May 6 by buying and selling the
constituent stocks may also have “contributed to a lack of
liquidity in ETF shares,” regulators found.  
 “If a stock within an ETF halts and the ETF continues to
trade, market makers will back away from the ETF and stop making
markets,” Gus Sauter, chief investment officer at Vanguard,
said in an interview. This applies to firms with specific
trading obligations called designated market makers on NYSE and
“unofficial people making markets” on other venues, he said.
