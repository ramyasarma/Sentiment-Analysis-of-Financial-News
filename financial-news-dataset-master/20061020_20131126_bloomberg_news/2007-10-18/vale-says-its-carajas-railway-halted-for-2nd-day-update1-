             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce  said operations
along its Carajas railway in  Brazil  were halted for a second day
because of protests, preventing the world's biggest  iron-ore 
producer from transporting 250,000 metric tons a day.  
 A Brazilian court ordered about 400 protesters to stop
blocking the railway in Brazil's northeastern state of Maranhao,
Rio de Janeiro-based Vale said today in a statement. The court
ordered police to remove the protesters, Vale said.  
 Vale closed the railway yesterday after members of the
Landless Workers Movement, which fights for farmland to be
redistributed to the poor, blocked the tracks and threw stones.  
 Vale transports about a third of its iron ore on the
railroad that runs from the Carajas mine in the Amazon to the Sao
Luis port in the northeast of Brazil. Vale also stopped
operations at an ore-processing plant in Maranhao.
