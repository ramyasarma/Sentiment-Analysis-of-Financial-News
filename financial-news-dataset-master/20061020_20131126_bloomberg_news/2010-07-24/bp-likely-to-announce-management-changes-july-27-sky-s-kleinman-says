             BP Plc is “increasingly likely” to
make an announcement about the future of its management and
board when it releases first-half results on July 27, Sky News
Business Editor Mark Kleinman wrote on his blog today.  
 The “strongest possibility” is that Chief Executive
Officer Tony Hayward will step down, Kleinman wrote. Such a
decision would be one agreed mutually by Hayward and BP, he
said.  
 The timing of an actual departure is “unclear” as most
observers say Hayward should remain in place until a relief well
is in place in the Gulf of Mexico, Kleinman said.  
 "There is nothing behind it," BP spokesman Steve Rinehart
said by phone from Houston today.
