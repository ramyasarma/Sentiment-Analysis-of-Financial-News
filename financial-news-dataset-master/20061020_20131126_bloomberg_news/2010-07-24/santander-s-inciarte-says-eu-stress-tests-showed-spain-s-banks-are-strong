             Spain’s banking system is one of the
world’s healthiest, even after five of the country’s lenders
failed the European Union’s stress tests, an executive with the
country’s largest bank said.  
 The test results, released yesterday, proved that
“transparency is critical for the stability of the financial
system,”  Juan Rodriguez Inciarte , an executive director with
Banco Santander SA, told reporters in Washington today. The
tests showed that “the Spanish banking system is one of the
strongest,” he said.  
 Four Spanish savings-bank groups and a bank seized by
regulators failed EU stress tests for a combined capital
shortfall of 1.84 billion euros ($2.4 billion). All eight
Spanish commercial banks tested passed the examination.  
 Santander  said its Tier 1 capital ratio would stay at 10
percent in 2011, the same level as at the end of 2009, under the
most severe stress-test scenario. While earnings decline, the
lender would continue to build capital and maintain its dividend
payout policy under the most adverse scenario examined in stress
tests, the Santander, Spain-based bank said in a statement
yesterday.  
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, the country’s second-
biggest bank, said its Tier 1 capital would drop to 9.3 percent
in 2011 in the worst scenario from 9.4 percent in 2009.  
 Rodriguez Inciarte was speaking during a meeting of the
U.S.-Spain Council, which promotes cooperation between the two
countries.
