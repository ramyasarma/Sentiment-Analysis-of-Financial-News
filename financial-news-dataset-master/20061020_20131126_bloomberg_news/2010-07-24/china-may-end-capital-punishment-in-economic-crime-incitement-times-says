             China may end capital punishment for
economic crimes, abduction, kidnapping and incitement, under a
proposed amendment to its criminal code, the  Global Times 
reported yesterday.  
 The legislature will receive next month a draft bill that
would reduce the number of crimes subject to capital punishment,
the report said, without giving a source for the information.
China is the country with the longest list of crimes for which
the death penalty can be imposed, said the state-affiliated
newspaper.
