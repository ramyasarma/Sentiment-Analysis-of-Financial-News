             Tata Motors Ltd. may sell $550
million of shares with differential voting rights in overseas
markets, Economic Times reported, citing a person it didn’t
identify.  
 The company will discuss the share sale plan after some
investors “expressed discomfort” with the current discount on
such shares compared with its ordinary stock, the daily said.
Debasis Ray, a Tata Motors spokesman, declined to comment.  
 Tata Motors, India’s biggest truck maker, rose 0.2 percent
to 838.4 rupees in Mumbai trading yesterday, while its shares
with differential voting rights fell 0.7 percent to 578.1
rupees.
