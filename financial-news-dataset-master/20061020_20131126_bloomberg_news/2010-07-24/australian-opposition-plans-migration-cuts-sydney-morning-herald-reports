             Australia’s opposition Liberal-
National coalition is planning to announce cuts of more than
110,000 migrant places a year, mostly in the skilled migrant
program, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on its website,
citing a senior campaign strategist. Opposition leader Tony
Abbott may present his plans for the cuts as early as tonight,
during his debate with Prime Minister Julia Gillard, according
