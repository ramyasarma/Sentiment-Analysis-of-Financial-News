             Manchester United wants to open
talks on a new contract with striker Wayne Rooney, the Daily
Mirror said.  
 Rooney scored 34 goals last season as United’s three-year
reign as Premier League champion was ended by Chelsea. He has
two years remaining on his current contract, the Mirror said.  
 United yesterday agreed to a “long-term” extension with
defender Nemanja Vidic, who had two years left on his contract.
