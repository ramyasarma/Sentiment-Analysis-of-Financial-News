             Ernst & Young LLP’s Item Club cut
its U.K. economic growth forecasts for the next three years and
predicted the Bank of England probably won’t raise interest
rates until 2014 because of the government’s budget squeeze.  
 Gross domestic product  will rise 2.2 percent next year,
compared with a prediction in April for 2.7 percent expansion,
the research group, which uses the same forecasting model as the
U.K. Treasury, said today according to an e-mailed statement.
The economic revival will be “slow” and “patchy” as GDP
climbs 1 percent this year, the group said.  
 Bank of England policy makers mulled expanding stimulus
this month after the economic outlook “deteriorated a little”
because the government announced the deepest spending cuts since
World War II to curb the record budget deficit. The majority of
officials voted for no change to the bank’s benchmark interest
rate, overruling  Andrew Sentance ’s call for an increase.  
 “The new coalition’s plans to cut the deficit are
certainly ambitious,”  Peter Spencer , chief economic adviser to
the ITEM Club and a former U.K. Treasury official, said in the
statement. “Growth will struggle to reach 1 percent this year
but will gradually speed up in the following years to give the
U.K. a high-quality recovery based on trade and investment.”  
 The potential impact on Britain’s exports from the
sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone and the “significant”
budget tightening will mean the Bank of England will not raise
its main interest rate from a record low of 0.5 percent for the
next four years, the Item Club said. An expansion of the central
bank’s 200 billion-pound ($308 billion) bond-purchase plan
“cannot be ruled out,” the group said.  
 The economy will now grow 2.8 percent in 2012 compared with
an April prediction of 3.4 percent, and 2.9 percent the
following year compared with the earlier forecast of 3.1
percent, the Item Club said.  
 The economy extended its recovery from the recession in the
second quarter.  Gross domestic product  rose 1.1 percent, almost
four times the 0.3 percent expansion seen in the previous three
months and almost double the median  forecast  of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.
