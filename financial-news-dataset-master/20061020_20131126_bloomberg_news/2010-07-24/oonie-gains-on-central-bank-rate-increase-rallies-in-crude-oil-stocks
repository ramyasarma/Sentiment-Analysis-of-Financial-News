             Canada’s dollar strengthened against
its U.S. counterpart after the nation’s central bank raised
interest rates for the second time in two months and stocks and
commodities climbed.  
 The Canadian currency gained this week against 14 of its 16
most-traded counterparts. It rose yesterday against the
greenback as most European banks that received stress tests
passed, easing concern more aren’t strong enough to weather a
government default. Canada’s economy expanded in May, a report
next week is forecast to show.  
 “The Canadian dollar will appreciate a little bit more,”
said  Blake Jespersen , director of foreign exchange at Bank of
Montreal’s BMO Capital unit in Toronto. “The market will take
these stress tests and pretty much forget them.”  
 The currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, appreciated 2.2 percent to
C$1.0358 per U.S. dollar yesterday in Toronto, from C$1.0582 on
July 16. It fell 2.3 percent last week. One Canadian dollar
purchases 96.54 cents.  
 Canadian government bonds fell, with the benchmark 10-year
note’s yield climbing 7 basis points to 3.23 percent, from 3.16
percent on July 16. The price of the 3.5 percent security
maturing in June 2020 fell 55 cents to C$102.30.  
 Oil, Stocks  
 Crude oil for September delivery increased 3.9 percent to
$78.98 a barrel in New York and touched $79.60, the highest
level since May 6. Crude is Canada’s biggest export.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index rallied 3.6 percent and
touched a one-month high of 1,103.73. The loonie tends to follow
movements in stocks and oil.  
 Foreigners bought a record net C$23.2 billion ($22 billion)
of Canadian securities in May, Statistics Canada reported on
July 19. They purchased a record C$11.5 billion of federal
government securities, almost double the previous record of
C$6.75 billion set in January.  
 Demand for Canadian bonds has increased on signs that the
country was exiting a global recession faster than other Group
of Seven countries, and that Canada’s debt burden will be lower.  
 Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  on June 1 became the
first G-7 central banker since July 2008 to lift borrowing
costs, increasing the benchmark interest rate to 0.5 percent.  
 Carney raised the  rate  again on July 20, increasing it a
quarter-percentage point to 0.75 percent. At the same time, he
said future boosts will be “weighed carefully against domestic
and global economic developments.”  
 ‘Dovish Rate Hike’  
 “The so-called dovish rate hike sort of underpins the
uncertainty regarding the rate outlook down the road,” said
 Shaun Osborne , Toronto-based chief currency strategist in at
Toronto Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit.  
 The central-bank governor also cut the nation’s growth
forecast by 0.2 percentage point this year and next, to 3.5 and
2.9 percent respectively, and said inflation will stay close to
his 2 percent target through 2012.  
 The consumer price index rose an annualized 1 percent in
June, the slowest in seven months, after a 1.4 percent gain in
May, Statistics Canada said yesterday. The core rate that
excludes eight volatile items slowed to an annual 1.7 percent
from 1.8 percent. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast
the inflation rate would be 1 percent and the core rate 1.9
percent.  
 A slower annual inflation rate reduces pressure on the
central bank to raise interest rates later this year.  
 Canada’s gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent in May,
after slipping to zero in April, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists before Statistics
Canada reports the data on July 30.  
 The loonie, which traded on a one-for-one basis with the
greenback on April 6 for the first time in almost two years, has
gained 5.1 percent this year, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indices, the second-best
performance among its 10 developed world counterparts behind the
yen’s 10 percent increase.
