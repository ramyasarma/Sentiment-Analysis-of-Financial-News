             Banco Popolare SC will sell some
“non-strategic” assets during the second half of the year to
improve its Tier 1 capital ratio, Chief Executive Officer
Pierfrancesco Saviotti said in an interview with il Sole 24 Ore
newspaper.  
 Banco Popolare passed the stress tests conducted by
European Union regulators and published yesterday, with a 7
percent capital ratio in the test’s adverse/sovereign scenario,
surpassing the 6 percent minimum required. The bank’s capital
buffer was 931 million euros ($1.2 billion).
