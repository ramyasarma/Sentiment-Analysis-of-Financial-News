             A ground and air search is under way
in Afghanistan for two U.S. service members missing since
yesterday who may have been captured by the Taliban in
Afghanistan.  
 The two left a compound in Kabul City in a vehicle
yesterday, according to a  statement  on NATO’s website that
didn’t identify their nationality. A senior North Atlantic
Treaty Organization military officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said both were Americans. The Associated Press
reported they were U.S. Navy personnel, citing unnamed
officials.  
 The two were captured by the Taliban, Akhtar Mohammed, a
senior Taliban commander, said in a telephone interview.  
 They were driving an armored sport-utility vehicle when
they were seized in Matinai, a village in an area south of Kabul
that’s controlled by the Taliban, the Washington Post reported,
citing Afghan officials.  
 Separately, five U.S. soldiers were killed today in
southern Afghanistan by improvised explosive devices, NATO said.  
 More than 1,000 U.S. soldiers have died in the war in
Afghanistan, the Department of Defense said July 23. President
 Barack Obama  has vowed to start bringing U.S. troops home next
year.
