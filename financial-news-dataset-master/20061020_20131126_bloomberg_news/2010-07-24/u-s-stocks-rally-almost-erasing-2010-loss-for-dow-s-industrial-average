             U.S. stocks  rose this week, almost
wiping out the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s 2010 loss, after
better-than-estimated  earnings  at companies from United Parcel
Service Inc. to Apple Inc. and Ford Motor Co. lifted confidence
the economy is recovering.  
 UPS, Apple and Ford gained 4 percent or more after their
per-share profit  beat  the average analyst estimate by at least 9
percent. Genzyme Corp. jumped 21 percent, the most since 2000
and the biggest gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after
two people familiar with the matter said Sanofi-Aventis SA
approached the drugmaker about a takeover.  
 The  S&P 500  gained 3.6 percent to 1,102.66 this week,
erasing its 1.2 percent loss from July 12 to July 16. It has
gained 7 percent since June 30 in its first monthly gain since
April. The  Dow  climbed 326.72 points, or 3.2 percent, to
10,424.62, cutting its 2010 decline to less than 0.1 percent.  
 “Earnings reports are helping the market get a little more
comfortable with the fact that you can have economic growth more
moderate, and in that environment companies can still grow their
earnings and are seeing pretty good business,” said  Walter Todd , who helps manage about $835 million at Greenwood Capital
in Greenwood, South Carolina. “If that trend continues, the
market can continue to work higher.”  
 The S&P 500 has risen 7.8 percent from a 10-month low on
July 2 on optimism about corporate profits. Of the 149 companies
in the  S&P 500  that reported earnings since July 12, about 85
percent have beaten the average analyst earnings forecast,
according to Bloomberg data.  
 Takeovers, Earnings  
 Takeovers have also lifted equities. U.S. companies have
been the targets of $397 billion in announced takeover offers so
far this year, 11 percent more than at the same time last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Second-quarter earnings  season began when Alcoa Inc. posted
profit that exceeded analyst projections on July 12. S&P 500
companies will increase profits by 35 percent in 2010 and 17
percent in 2011, the fastest two-year gain since 1995, according
to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Since reaching a 19-month high of 1,217.28 in April, the
S&P 500 has lost 9.4 percent, led by financial firms and energy
producers. The gauge may rally to its June intra-day high of
1,131 if it breaks out of a so-called downtrend channel,
according to technical analysis by BGC Partners Inc., which said
the benchmark is “inching closer” to the breakout level.  
 Building Permits  
 Basic-materials makers and industrial companies gained this
week on a report saying U.S. building permits rose in June for
the first time since March. The S&P 500 Materials Index rose 7.1
percent to its highest weekly level in two months, with mining
company  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.  advancing 20 percent to
$55.90.  
 S&P 500 industrial shares jumped 7.2 percent as a group
during the week to the highest level since May.  Boeing Co. , the
Chicago-based planemaker, surged 9.7 percent to $67.93 on orders
worth $10 billion placed at the Farnborough Air Show near
London.  
 All of the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 advanced this
week except a measure of health care stocks. Each gained at
least 2.4 percent.  
 “We had a nice rally the past two weeks, but despite that
investor pessimism remains at a high level,” said  Bruce Bittles , chief investment strategist for Robert Baird & Co.
which manages $78 billion. “This rally has more room on the
upside. The earnings reports are significant.”  
 Harley-Davidson Inc. , the biggest U.S. motorcycle maker,
rose 20 percent to $28.36 in the biggest weekly gain since March
2009. A profit in the company’s consumer loan unit helped
second-quarter revenue and earnings top analysts’ estimates.  
 Shares of the pharmaceutical company  Genzyme Corp. , the
largest maker of drugs for genetic diseases, surged $10.75 to
$62.52 after two people with knowledge of the matter said Paris-
based drugmaker  Sanofi-Aventis SA  made an offer to acquire the
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company.
