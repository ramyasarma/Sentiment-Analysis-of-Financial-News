             South Africa’s ruling African
National Congress plans to discuss a proposal to nationalize the
country’s mines when it holds its national general council
meeting in September.   
 The ANC will also discuss “broadly the role of the state”
in the economy, the party’s secretary, Gwede Manatshe, told
reporters in Johannesburg today. The ANC will release documents
on the proposals next week.
