             Chelsea striker Didier Drogba may
miss the start of the Premier League season after undergoing
surgery yesterday for a groin injury.  
 Drogba, 32, is expected to return to full training in about
three weeks after the “minimally invasive” operation, Chelsea
said on its website. The Blues open defense of their Premier
League title Aug. 14 against West Bromwich Albion.  
 Drogba, 31, was bothered by the injury for part of last
season, when he led the league with 29 goals, Chelsea said. He
then played for Ivory Coast at the World Cup in South Africa.
