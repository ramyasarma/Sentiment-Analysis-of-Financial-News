             Unione di Banche Italiane Scpa has
“absolutely no” plan for a capital increase after it passed
stress tests conducted by European Union regulators, Chief
Executive Officer Victor Massiah said in an interview with la
Repubblica newspaper.  
 UBI Banca had a 6.8 percent Tier 1 capital ratio in the
test’s adverse/sovereign scenario, more than the 6 percent
minimum required. In this scenario, the bank had a buffer of 686
million euros ($886 million).
