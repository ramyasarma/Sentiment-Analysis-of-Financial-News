             Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. , the
nation’s biggest carmaker, said profit fell for the first time
in five quarters, missing estimates, as increased raw material
costs eroded gains from higher vehicle sales.  
 Net income  fell 20 percent to 4.65 billion rupees ($99
million), or 16.11 rupees a share, in the three months ended in
June, from 5.84 billion rupees, or 20.2 rupees, a year earlier,
the unit of  Suzuki Motor Corp.  said in an e-mailed statement
today. That was lower than the 6.7 billion rupee average of 24
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 27 percent
to 80.5 billion rupees.  
 Maruti’s spending on steel and other raw materials
increased 26 percent in the quarter as a reviving global economy
boosted prices of commodities. Competition for New Delhi-based
Maruti is rising as Volkswagen AG, Nissan Motor Co. and other
automakers introduce new compacts in Asia’s third-largest
passenger-car market.  
 “Raw material prices have been a severe problem for auto
companies,” said  Umesh Karne , a Mumbai-based analyst at BRICS
Securities Ltd. who has an ‘underperform’ rating on Maruti’s
shares. “Increased competition is preventing the company from
raising vehicle prices to absorb this cost.”  
 The carmaker,  54.2 percent  owned by Japan’s Suzuki, sold
283,324 cars, vans and sport-utility vehicles in the quarter in
India and overseas, compared with 226,729 a year earlier.
 Exports  climbed 38 percent.  
 Euro, Royalty  
 The weakening of the euro during the quarter hurt income
from exports, Maruti said in the statement. The euro  fell  5.8
percent against the Indian rupee during the quarter, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Europe accounted for as much as
80 percent of the company’s export revenue, Chief Financial
Officer  Ajay Seth  said in April.  
 Payment of additional royalty worth 1.9 billion rupees to
Suzuki also affected earnings, the company said.  
 Maruti  shares rose 0.3 percent to 1,358.2 rupees in Mumbai
trading yesterday. They have dropped 13 percent so far this year.  
 The carmaker aims to spend 17 billion rupees to expand the
capacity at its Manesar plant, outside New Delhi, to 550,000
vehicles in the next two years. Maruti’s factory at Gurgaon, a
New Delhi suburb, can produce 700,000 vehicles per year.  
 Volkswagen,  Toyota Motor Corp.  and other automakers have
unveiled at latest 10 new models this year in India, where
vehicle sales may reach 3 million annually by 2015, according to
a 2006 government forecast. Industrywide sales in the year ended
March increased at the fastest pace in six years.  
 India’s $1.2 trillion economy, Asia’s largest after Japan
and China, expanded 8.6 percent in the quarter ended in March
from a year earlier. The central bank expects gross domestic
product to grow 8 percent this year.
