             Reigning Horse of the Year Rachel
Alexandra outran five competitors today to capture her second
consecutive 2010 win in the $400,000 Lady’s Secret Stakes at
Monmouth Park.  
 The 4-year-old mare, the 1-9 favorite with  Calvin Borel 
aboard, covered the 1 1/8-mile race in one minute, 49 3/5
seconds, three lengths ahead of Queen Martha in the 95-degree
heat.  
 “She came through it pretty well. It was super hot. She
did what she needed to do and did it easily,” said owner
 Barbara Banke , the wife of  Jess Jackson , in a telephone
interview from Monmouth Park. Borel “didn’t want to exhaust her
in the heat. Calvin was feeling the heat himself.”  
 Rachel Alexandra stayed in second place behind Queen Martha
for most of the slow-paced race until she roared into first
coming down the stretch.  
 “It was a hot day and she kept her composure,” said
trainer  Steve Asmussen  in a television interview. “She’s doing
really well. We should have a lot of mare going into the end of
the year.”  
 Rachel Alexandra returned $2.20 to win, $2.10 to place and
$2.10 to show on a $2 bet at the Oceanport, New Jersey, track.
Queen Martha paid $2.80 and $2.40 and Ask the Moon paid $3.80.  
 Monmouth officials changed the date of the Lady’s Secret
Stakes -- moving it up one week -- increased the purse to
$400,000 from $150,000 and extended the race length to 1 1/8
miles from 1/16 miles.  
 Next Race Undecided  
 Banke said Rachel Alexandra’s next race hasn’t been
decided, although the trainer and owners are “timing the races
to get her to the Breeders’ Cup.”  
 Jackson hasn’t disclosed in which of the Breeders’ Cup
races he will enter Rachel Alexandra. The Breeders’ Cup World
Championships will be held Nov. 5-6 at Churchill Downs in
Louisville, Kentucky.  
 “Jess would like to meet Zenyatta,” Banke said. “We’ll
have to see how that shakes out.”  
 Zenyatta, a 6-year-old mare, is undefeated, winning all 17
starts, including last year’s $5 million Breeders’ Cup Class in
which she beat a field of male competitors.  
 Rachel Alexandra, who won nine straight races last year
including the 2009 Preakness Stakes and a 20 1/2-length victory
in the Kentucky Oaks, came in second in her first two races of
the 2010 campaign. She won the $214,000 Fleur de Lis by 10 ½
lengths on June 12 at Churchill Downs.
