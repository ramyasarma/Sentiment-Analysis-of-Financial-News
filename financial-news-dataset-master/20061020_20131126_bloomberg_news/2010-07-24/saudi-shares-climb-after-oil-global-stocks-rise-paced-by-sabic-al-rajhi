             Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
rose the most in two weeks, driven by banks and petrochemical
companies following advances in U.S. and European shares and
the price of oil.  
 Samba Financial Group , the second-largest publicly traded
lender in Saudi Arabia, and  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , the
world’s largest petrochemical maker, lifted the  Tadawul All
Share Index  the most since July 10. The benchmark jumped 1.6
percent to 6,187.39 at 3:30 p.m. in Riyadh.  
 “A general feeling-good factor is pervading,” said  John Sfakianakis , chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi in Riyadh.
“It is based on overall thin volumes, as oil is above $78 and
global markets performed well over the past two days.”  
 U.S., European and developing-nation markets advanced
this week. The  S&P 500  gained 3.6 percent, the  Dow  climbed
3.2 percent and the  Stoxx 600  soared 3.2 percent.  
 The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index , which tracks developing-
nation equity markets, advanced for a fourth day yesterday to
its highest level in 11 weeks.  
 Oil has risen 4.4 percent this month. Crude for September
delivery settled at $78.98 a barrel in New York yesterday. Saudi
Arabia holds one-fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves.  
 The Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and the summer holiday
season are keeping “major players” out, while  “small
investors are pushing the market up,” said Younas Malick,
senior economist at National Commercial Bank in Jeddah.  
 Samba  climbed the most in seven weeks, gaining 6.5 percent
to 59.7 riyals. Al Rajhi Bank rose 1.7 percent, the most since
July 10, to 76.5 riyals.  
 Deals With China  
 Saudi Basic, or  Sabic , increased 2 percent, the most in
almost two weeks, to 88.25 riyals. Sabic said on June 21 its
second-quarter sales rose 63 percent as demand for fertilizers
and plastics increased with the global economic recovery. The
company separately signed deals with Chinese companies to sell
them products valued at 6 billion yuan ($885.4 million).  
 Saudi Chemical Co. , a distributor of drugs made by
 AstraZeneca Plc  and  GlaxoSmithKline Plc , rose 0.7 percent to
46.6 riyals, the highest level since August 2008.  
 Saudi Arabia’s index is the only Gulf Arab index tracked by
Bloomberg that trades on Saturday.
