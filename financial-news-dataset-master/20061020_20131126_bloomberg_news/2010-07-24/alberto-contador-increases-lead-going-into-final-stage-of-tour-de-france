             Defending champion Alberto Contador
increased his lead to 39 seconds going to the final stage of the
Tour de France after Fabian Cancellara won today’s time trial.  
 Contador of the Astana team finished the 52-kilometer (32-
mile) time trial from Bordeaux to Pauillac in 1 hour, 6 minutes
and 39 seconds, 31 seconds faster than second-place Andy Schleck
of Team Saxo Bank.  
 The Spaniard can claim his third Tour title in four years
in tomorrow’s 20th and final stage ending on the Champs Elysees
in Paris. Luxembourg’s Schleck is set to finish runner-up for
the second straight year.  
 Cancellara, Schleck’s teammate, won today in 1 hour and 56
seconds for his second stage win this year. The Swiss won the
opening prologue in Rotterdam on July 3.
