             Coalition forces in Afghanistan are
undertaking a ground and air search for two U.S. service members
missing since July 23 who may have been captured by the Taliban.  
 The two left a compound in the capital, Kabul, in a vehicle
two days ago, according to a  statement  on NATO’s website that
didn’t identify their nationality. A senior North Atlantic
Treaty Organization military officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said both were Americans. The Associated Press
reported they were U.S. Navy personnel, citing unidentified
officials.  
 The two were captured by the Taliban,  Akhtar Mohammed , a
senior Taliban commander, said in a telephone interview
yesterday.  
 An armored sport-utility vehicle came under fire from
Taliban forces in the Charkh district south of Kabul late on
July 23, AP cited Samer Gul, the region’s chief, as saying
yesterday. One of the occupants may have been killed and the
other captured, Gul said, according to AP.  
 The servicemen were seized in Matinai, a village in an area
south of Kabul controlled by the Taliban, the Washington Post
reported, citing unidentified Afghan officials.  
 Separately, five U.S. soldiers were killed yesterday in
southern Afghanistan by improvised explosive devices, NATO said.  
 More than 1,000 U.S. soldiers have died in the war in
Afghanistan, the Department of Defense said July 23. President
 Barack Obama  has vowed to start bringing U.S. troops home next
year.
