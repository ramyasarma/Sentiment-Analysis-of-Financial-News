             A train crash in Switzerland
yesterday killed one woman and injured 42 people, mostly
Japanese tourists, Kyodo News reported, citing tour operators
and local police.  
 The 64-year-old-woman from Hyogo prefecture died after the
last three cars of the six-car Glacier Express sightseeing train
derailed, Kyodo said, citing  All Nippon Airways Co.  The cause of
the accident wasn’t immediately known and would be investigated,
local police said, according to the report.  
 Among the injured, 38 were Japanese tourists, and 24 of
them have been sent to hospitals, Kyodo reported. Two women are
in critical condition and remain unconscious, the news agency
said, citing Japanese travel companies. ANA Sales Co.,  JTB Corp. 
and  Hankyu Travel International Co.  said people on their tours
were in the derailed train.  
 The train operator carried out some work in June on the
tracks around where the accident occurred, though it was unsure
whether it was at the same place, Kyodo said, citing a spokesman
from the company.  
 The  Glacier Express  covers a seven-hour journey across the
Swiss Alps from Zermatt to St. Moritz, offering picturesque
views of mountain landscapes and valleys.
