             The  Rolling Stones  will start their
farewell world tour next year, bowing out after half a century
of rock ‘n roll,  the Sun  newspaper reported today, citing an
unidentified person.  
 The band, formed in 1962, is in talks with promoters  Live
Nation  about the tour, the newspaper said. The performances are
set to last into 2012, it said.  
 The four members of the Rolling Stones will have a combined
age of 268 when the tour begins, with drummer  Charlie Watts 
turning 70 while on the road, the Sun said. Bandmate  Ronnie Wood 
is 63, while  Mick Jagger  and  Keith Richards  are both 66, it
reported.  
 They performed a farewell tour of Britain in 1971 before
leaving the country to avoid taxes, the Sun said. The Rolling
Stones have sold more than 200 million albums, the paper said.
