             Mano Menezes was named coach of the
Brazil national soccer team, replacing the fired  Carlos Dunga .  
 Menezes had been the coach of Sao Paulo club Corinthians.
Dunga was dismissed July 4 after World Cup favorite Brazil was
eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarterfinals.  
 Ricardo Teixeira , president of Brazil’s soccer federation,
said Menezes wants to develop a team that will have a
competitive style but still have the “face of  Brazilian
football .” Brazil will host the next World Cup in 2014.  
 “He showed courage and also pride to have the opportunity
that all coaches dream for, which is to control the Brazilian
national team,” Teixeira said in the statement. “I am certain
that it will turn into a great job in the run-up to 2014.”  
 Muricy Ramalho was offered the job but turned it down to
remain with his club Fluminense, the federation said yesterday.
