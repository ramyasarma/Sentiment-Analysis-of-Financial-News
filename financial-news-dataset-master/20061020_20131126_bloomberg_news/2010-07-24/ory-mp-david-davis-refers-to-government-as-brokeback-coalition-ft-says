             U.K.  Prime Minister David Cameron’s
coalition government has been called the “Brokeback Coalition”
by colleagues, the  Financial Times  said.  
 David Davis , a Tory politician, used the reference to the
film about two gay cowboys at a private lunch on July 22 in
London, the FT said. Davis later said he was misheard, according
to the newspaper.
