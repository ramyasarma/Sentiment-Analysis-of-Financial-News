             Pakistan beat Australia in Test
cricket for the first time since 1995, winning by three wickets
at Headingley in Leeds.  
 Pakistan began the fourth day 140-3, needing just 40 runs
for victory. Australia claimed 4-40 before Umar Gul hit the
winning run to give Pakistan a draw in the two-Test series.
Australia, which was bowled out for 348 in its second innings,
had won the past 13 matches from Pakistan.  
 Australia was all out for 88 runs in its first innings,
while Pakistan reached 258. Australia had won the toss and
decided to bat, having taken the series opener by 150 runs.  
 The series was played in England because of security
concerns over staging games in Pakistan. It counted as a home
series for Pakistan.
