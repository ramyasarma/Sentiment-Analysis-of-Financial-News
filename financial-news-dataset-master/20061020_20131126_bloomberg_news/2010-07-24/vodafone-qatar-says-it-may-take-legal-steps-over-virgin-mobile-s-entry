             Vodafone Qatar  said it may take
further legal steps after the country’s telecommunications
regulator ruled on its dispute with Qatar Telecom QSC over
Virgin Mobile’s entry into the market.  
 Vodafone Qatar is reviewing the decision “to determine if
they may take further legal action with courts to rectify the
impact” of the matter, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 The regulator, ictQATAR,  issued a decision  that was sent to
the parties involved though it wasn’t posted on ictQATAR’s
website. A spokesman for the agency didn’t immediately respond
to a phone call or e-mail request for comment.  
 Qatar Telecom and Virgin Mobile announced in May a
partnership to set up a mobile-phone operator in the emirate.  
 ictQATAR said later that month it would investigate
complaints about unlicensed telecom services in the country
after Vodafone Qatar said it would take legal action against the
regulator for “allowing” Virgin Mobile into the market without
a license.  
 Vodafone Qatar and Qatar Telecom both said in e-mailed
statements today that they “welcomed” the regulator’s
decision. Virgin Mobile’s services will keep being offered in
Qatar, Qatar Telecom said.
