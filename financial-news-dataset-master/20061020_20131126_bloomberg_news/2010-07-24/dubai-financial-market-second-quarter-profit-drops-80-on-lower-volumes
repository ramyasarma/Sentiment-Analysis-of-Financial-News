             Dubai Financial Market PJSC , the
only Gulf Arab stock market to sell shares to the public, said
second-quarter profit dropped 80 percent from a year earlier as
trading volumes plunged.  
 Net income  was 25.9 million dirhams ($7.1 million) in the
three months through June, according to an e-mailed statement
from the company. Dubai Financial Market reported profit of
128.3 million dirhams in the second quarter last year.  
 Trading value  in the second quarter dropped 32 percent to
19 billion dirhams compared with 28 billion dirhams in the first
quarter, the statement said.  
 Dubai Financial Market is in the process of merging with
Nasdaq Dubai and has paid for two-thirds of the acquisition.
“The company effectively implemented the many stages of the
consolidation process between the two exchanges,” Chairman
 Abdul Jalil Yousuf  said in the statement.  
 On May 25, Dubai Financial Market said it will pay the
remaining third to Borse Dubai Ltd. when the merger of Dubai
Financial Market and Nasdaq Dubai has been completed.  
 Dubai Financial Market rose 0.7 percent to close at 1.52
dirhams on July 22, paring the decline this year to 19 percent.
