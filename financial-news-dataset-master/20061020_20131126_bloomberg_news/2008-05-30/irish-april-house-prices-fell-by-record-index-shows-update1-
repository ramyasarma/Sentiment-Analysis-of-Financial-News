             Irish  house prices  fell by a record
in April as demand for property declined, unemployment rose and
banks increased borrowing costs.  
 House prices decreased 9.2 percent to an average of 278,521
euros ($432,000) in April from the same month a year earlier,
according to a monthly index published by Dublin-based  Irish
Life & Permanent Plc (IPM)  today. The drop is the biggest since the
index was started in 1996.  
 Ireland's housing market was the worst performer in Europe
last year as rising  interest rates  ended a decade-long boom that
saw average prices quadruple. Builders have scaled back projects
and slashed costs to lure homebuyers deterred by higher
borrowing expenses and fears of a property-price crash.  
 ``A pattern of falling  house prices  and rising rents
suggests that potential buyers are renting, in part due to the
deterioration in affordability and also reflecting a change in
price expectations,'' said Dan McLaughlin, chief economist at
Bank of Ireland Plc in Dublin. ``Moreover, there is uncertainty
over  mortgage rates .''  
 Prices slipped 1.1 percent in April from March, after
declining 0.7 percent in March.  
 In Dublin, where about a quarter of Ireland's 4.2 million
people live, house prices fell 0.9 percent in April from the
previous month to an average of 386,658 euros. The average paid
outside the capital declined 0.8 percent to 240,392 euros.  
 The price of new homes fell by 2 percent during the month.
