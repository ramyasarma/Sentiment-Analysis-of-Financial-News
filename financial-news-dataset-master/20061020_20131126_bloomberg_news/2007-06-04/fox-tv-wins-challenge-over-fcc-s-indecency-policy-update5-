             Fox Television Stations Inc. won a
court challenge to a U.S. Federal Communications Commission rule
that expanded federal broadcast indecency policy by targeting
``fleeting expletives'' on live shows.  
 A federal appeals court in  New York  today struck down the
rule as ``arbitrary and capricious'' and ordered the FCC to hold
further proceedings on revisions to its 30-year-old policy. Fox,
part of New York based  News Corp. (NWSA) , challenged the FCC's decision
to cite the network for violating indecency and profanity rules
by airing expletives during live awards-show broadcasts.  
 The ruling may force the agency to reconsider 2006
indecency rules it applied to Fox after singer Cher and actress
 Nicole Richie  uttered profanities during the Billboard Music
Awards' shows in 2002 and 2003. Other media outlets including
CBS and NBC also urged the appeals court to toss out the rules,
which included a broader definition of ``profane.''  
 ``Score one for the First Amendment,'' said Andrew Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a Washington
based public interest law firm who represented Hollywood
creative professionals in the case.  
 News Corp.'s Class A shares fell 1 cent to $22.57 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have risen
5.1 percent this year.  
 Meaning of Words  
 ``I completely disagree with the Court's ruling and am
disappointed for American families,'' FCC Chairman Kevin Martin
said in an e-mailed statement. ``Hollywood will be able to say
anything they want, whenever they want'' if the agency can't
restrict expletives for sexual activity and defecation during
prime-time television.  
 The case also involved rulings against the networks for
expletives in the police drama ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' and a comment
by a player in the CBS show ``Survivor'' on ``The Early Show.''  
 In its ruling, the court said such words often have other
meanings.  
 ``In recent times even the top leaders of our government
has used variants of these expletives in a manner that no
reasonable person would believe referenced sexual or excretory
organs or activities.''  
 The court cited instances where President  George W. Bush 
and Vice President Richard Cheney were recorded on tape using
profanities or were reported to have done so.  
 High Fines  
 While broadcasters and the FCC have been fighting over
indecency issues for decades, the stakes increased last year
when Congress authorized a 10-fold increase in fines to as much
as $325,000 for each TV station that airs indecent material.  
 In its appeal, Fox argued the FCC revised its indecency
policy in ways that exceeded the agency's authority to regulate
content on television.  
 Fox said the FCC was making a ``radical reinterpretation''
of the broadcast indecency policy because the agency holds
broadcasters liable for isolated, even accidental, uses of
profanity during times when children are most likely in the
audience.  
 ``We are very pleased with the court's decision and
continue to believe that government regulation of content serves
no purpose other than to chill artistic expression,'' Fox said
in a statement. ``Viewers should be allowed to determine for
themselves and their families, through the many parental control
technologies available, what is appropriate viewing for their
home.''  
 `Fleeting Expletives'  
 The appeals court, by a 2-1 vote, said the FCC's new policy
regarding ``fleeting expletives'' was a ``significant departure
from positions previously taken by the agency and relied on by
the broadcast industry.'' The court said the FCC had failed to
articulate a ``reasoned basis'' for the policy shift.  
 The court also said it was ``doubtful'' the agency could
come up with rules that stand up to a constitutional challenge.  
 Schwartzman said today's decision isn't immediately
operative, as the FCC weighs an appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court. Eventually, the ruling will force the agency to nullify
``almost all'' of the changes it announced in March 2006, he
said.  
 The case is Fox v. FCC, 06-1760, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals (New York).
