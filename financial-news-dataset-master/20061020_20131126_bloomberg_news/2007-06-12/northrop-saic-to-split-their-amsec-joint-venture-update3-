             Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , the world's
largest warship builder, and  SAIC Inc. (SAI)  plan to breakup their
naval and aviation engineering joint venture Amsec LLC along
customer and product lines.  
 Northrop's Newport News segment will retain the ship
engineering, logistics and technical services units under the
Amsec name, the California-based companies said today in a
statement. SAIC will receive the aviation, combat systems and
strike-force integration-services divisions.  
 Amsec is a majority-owned subsidiary of SAIC and is
included in SAIC's financial results. The annual  revenue  that
SAIC will lose as result of the breakup is projected to be about
$200 million in 2008, the companies said. The split will have
``a negligible impact'' on SAIC's earnings per share from
continuing operations in 2008.  
 The restructuring is not forecast to be material to
Northrop Grumman's financial results, the statement said. The
split is anticipated to be completed in mid-July.  
 Shares of Los Angeles-based Northrop fell 38 cents to
$75.55 at 4:01 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite
trading. They have added 12 percent so far this year. San Diego-based SAIC fell 34 cents to $17.73.
