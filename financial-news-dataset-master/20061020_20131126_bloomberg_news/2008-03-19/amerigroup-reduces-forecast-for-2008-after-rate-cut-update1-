             Amerigroup Corp. (AGP) , a provider of
managed health care for low-income Americans, reduced its profit
forecast for 2008 after the U.S.  Federal Reserve  cut its
benchmark interest rate.  
 Full-year earnings probably will be $2.46 to $2.61 a share,
Amerigroup said in a PR Newswire statement today. The Virginia
Beach, Virginia-based company previously forecast earnings of
$2.58 to $2.73 a share.  
 The Federal Reserve reduced its main lending rate by three
quarters of a percentage point to 2.25 percent yesterday in an
attempt to prop up the economy. Amerigroup, which serves more
than 1.7 million people in 10 states and Washington, D.C., said
it expects the lower rate to affect the company for the remainder
of 2008.  
 The health-care provider is scheduled to release first-
quarter earnings on April 23.
