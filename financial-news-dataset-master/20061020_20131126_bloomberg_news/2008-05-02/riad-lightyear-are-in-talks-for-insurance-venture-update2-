             Triad Guaranty Inc., the mortgage
insurer that lost 95 percent of its market value in the past
year, is in talks with a private equity firm to create a new
mortgage guarantee company.  
 Triad and Lightyear Capital LLC are in exclusive
negotiations and expect to complete an agreement in four to six
weeks, the Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based insurer said
today in a statement. Lightyear and its partners are expected to
provide as much as $400 million, according to Triad.  
 The insurer said in an April 1 filing it may have to stop
selling coverage because the firm lacked capital after losses
caused by the worst housing slump in a quarter century.  Fitch
Ratings  cut the company's claims-paying ability to junk, saying
a deal with Lightyear would place Triad into ``voluntary
runoff.''  
 ``The company appears to be unable to attract new
capital,'' Fitch, based in  New York , said in a statement.
``Triad's margin of safety to meet policyholder obligations
could become pressured.''  
 Triad advanced 8 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $2.46 at 9:36
a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  
 Triad said some of its managers and many of its employees
may join the new company. The new insurer would provide
financial support to Triad, the statement said.  
 Fitch downgraded Triad's claims paying ability to BB from
BBB-.
