             Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF) , the
nation's biggest supermarket operator by market value, said
third-quarter profit rose 71 percent as it added new stores and
sales at existing outlets climbed.  
 Net income rose to 321 million rupees ($8 million) in the
three months ended March 31 from 187.2 million rupees a year
earlier, the Mumbai-based company said today. Sales rose 57
percent to 13.6 billion rupees.  
 Managing Director Kishore Biyani is boosting sales by
opening stores and increasing promotions to attract customers.
The company plans to almost double its Big Bazaar hypermarket
stores to 160 by the end of this year as it seeks to benefit
from rising domestic consumption. Sales at all chain stores in
 India  may rise eightfold to $97 billion by 2012, consultant
Technopak Advisors Pvt. forecast.  
 The company will have as much as 11 million square feet of
retail space in the year ending June 30 and will almost double
that to 20 million square feet by June 30, 2009, Biyani has said.  
 Biyani has expanded his businesses to include consumer
finance, retail broking and investment advice to get a bigger
share of consumer spending in India.
