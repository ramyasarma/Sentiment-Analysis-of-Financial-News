             New Zealand made one change to its
starting lineup for the Aug. 7 Tri-Nations rugby Test against
Australia in Christchurch, recalling  Piri Weepu  at scrum-half
for the injured Jimmy Cowan.  
 Alby Mathewson was named as Weepu’s backup on the bench,
while Benson Stanley replaced Israel Dagg as backline cover in
the other changes to the 22-man squad on duty for the All
Blacks’ 49-28 win in Melbourne three days ago.  
 Another victory at AMI Stadium in Christchurch would extend
New Zealand’s winning streak to nine in a rivalry stretching
back to 1903, matching the record set between 1936 and 1947.  
 The All Blacks can clinch their 10th Tri-Nations title and
the Bledisloe Cup by securing the maximum five points for a
victory and preventing the Wallabies from getting a bonus point.  
 NEW ZEALAND: Mils Muliaina, Cory Jane, Conrad Smith, Ma’a
Nonu, Joe Rokocoko, Dan Carter, Piri Weepu, Kieran Read, Richie
McCaw (captain), Jerome Kaino, Tom Donnelly, Brad Thorn, Owen
Franks, Keven Mealamu, Tony Woodcock.   
 Reserves: Corey Flynn, Ben Franks, Sam Whitelock, Victor
Vito, Alby Mathewson, Aaron Cruden, Benson Stanley.
