             China’s stocks fell the most in a
week, led by banks and property developers, on concern the
government will maintain curbs on lending.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.6 percent to 2,656 at
10:54 a.m. local time. China’s central bank in October may
increase the amount of reserves the nation’s banks are required
to keep, the Securities Times reported today, citing
unidentified officials from the banking industry. Last month’s
rally was fueled by speculation the government would relax
lending and property curbs to boost the economy.
