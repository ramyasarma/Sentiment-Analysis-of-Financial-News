             Motiva Enterprises LLC said it's in 
the process of shutting a fluid catalytic cracker at its Port 
Arthur, Texas, oil refinery to repair a valve leak.  
 Maintenance began yesterday at 8 a.m. local time and will
end at the same time tomorrow, the company said in a  filing  to
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. A leak developed
in the slide valve that controls the flow of spent catalyst at
the unit, the filing showed.  
 Motiva, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc and
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., can process 300,000 barrels a day of
crude oil at its Port Arthur refinery, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.
