             Liverpool may be sold by Aug. 31 and
the soccer club’s future remains under the control of its board,
the Guardian  reported , citing Chairman  Martin Broughton , who was
hired to oversee the sale.  
 “It still remains the objective to conclude a deal before
the end of the transfer window,” Broughton was cited as saying
last night by the Guardian.  
 Chinese businessman Kenny Huang’s bid is one of
“several,” the Guardian said. Huang approached Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc with an offer to acquire the club’s debt of
237 million pounds ($376 million) in an effort to gain financial
control, the newspaper added.  
 “Any bids that go straight to RBS, and there have been
several, come to me and are directed to” Barclays Capital, the
Guardian cited Broughton as saying. “RBS are not involved. The
control remains with the board.” Barclays Capital was appointed
April 16 to advise on the sale.
