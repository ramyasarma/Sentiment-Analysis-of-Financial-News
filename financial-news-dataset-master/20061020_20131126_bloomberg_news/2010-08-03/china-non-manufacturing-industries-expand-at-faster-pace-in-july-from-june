             China’s non-manufacturing industries
expanded at a faster pace in July.  
 A purchasing managers’ index released today by the China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing rose to 60.1 from 57.4 in
June. A number above 50 indicates an expansion and below 50 a
contraction.   
 The federation’s non-manufacturing PMI is based on data
compiled from purchasing executives from 1,191 companies in 20
sectors including building, manufacturing services and consumer
services. The figures aren’t seasonally adjusted.
