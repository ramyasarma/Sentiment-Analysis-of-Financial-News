             Hills Industries Ltd. , whose products
range from television antennas to children’s play equipment,
said fiscal full-year profit quadrupled after a turnaround in
the company’s home and hardware division.  
 Net income in the 12 months to June 30 climbed to A$40.2
million ($36.7 million), from A$9.5 million a year ago, the
Adelaide-based company said in a statement today. The shares
jumped 8.3 percent to A$2.35 as of 11:08 a.m. in Sydney.  
 Earnings at its home and hardware business recovered as it
cut the number of products to boost profitability. Australia’s
economy skirted the global recession as consumers maintained
spending and house prices climbed.  
 “We remain focused on retaining the business improvements
implemented in the 2009 and 2010 financial years,” said
 Jennifer Hill-Ling , the company’s chairman. The company has “a
number of growth initiatives in place to deliver a modest
improvement in profits for the 2011 financial year.”  
 Hills proposed a full-year  dividend  of 12.5 Australian
cents per share, an increase of 25 percent from last year.
