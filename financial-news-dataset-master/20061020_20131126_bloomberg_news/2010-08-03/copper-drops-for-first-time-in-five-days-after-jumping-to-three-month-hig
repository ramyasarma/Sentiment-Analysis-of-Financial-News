             Copper declined for the first time in
five days in Asia, as some investors sold the metal to lock in
gains after the rise to a three-month high yesterday.  
 The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to $7,470 a metric ton by
8:05 a.m. in Singapore.
