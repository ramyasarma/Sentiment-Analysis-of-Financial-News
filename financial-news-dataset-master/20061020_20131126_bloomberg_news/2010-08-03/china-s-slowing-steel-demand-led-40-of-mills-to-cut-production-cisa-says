             Slowing steel demand in China, the
world’s largest consumer of the metal, forced 40 percent of
mills to cut output or put plants on maintenance this year, the
China Iron & Steel Association said.  
 Costs of production have risen while steel prices have
dropped since April,  Luo Bingsheng , vice chairman of the China
Iron & Steel Association said today at a press conference in
Beijing.  
 “Facing higher costs and lower prices, steelmakers’
margins will be further reduced, so the situation this quarter
is very tough,” Luo said.  
 Domestic prices  of hot-rolled coil fell for seven straight
weeks to July 16, as government measures to curb property
speculation damped demand for steel. The average import costs of
iron ore, a key steelmaking ingredient, in China jumped 46.4
percent in the first half from a year ago, the steel association
said today.
