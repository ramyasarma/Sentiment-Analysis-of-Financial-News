             Geodynamics Ltd. plans to raise less
than the A$100 million it previously targeted in a share sale
expected later this year because of market uncertainty, Managing
Director Jack Hamilton said.  
 Geodynamics plans to begin producing power from a 25
megawatt plant and to demonstrate the project’s commercial
viability in early 2015 after a final investment decision in
2013, he said in an interview in Sydney. Hamilton, who
became interim managing director after Gerry Grove-White
resigned last month, said Geodynamics plans to name a permanent
replacement by the end of the year.
