             Investors should buy the “under-
owned” stock markets of Thailand and South Korea after  India 
led foreign investment into Asian emerging markets, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 Foreign investors purchased a net $5.8 billion of Indian
stocks in June and July, making up half of the $11.7 billion
going to the region’s developing markets excluding China and
Malaysia, said Credit Suisse analysts led by  Sakthi Siva . Even
amid foreign buying, the MSCI India Index’s 5.7 percent gain
since May 31 lagged behind a 9 percent advance in the MSCI Asia
excluding Japan Index.  
 Foreign investors are adding to holdings in India, whose
economy is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to expand
9.4 percent this fiscal year, the fastest pace since 2007. The
 MSCI India  has gained 3.2 percent in 2010 and is  valued  at 17.8
times estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of 13.5 times
for the regional index, according to data tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “Except for materials and telecoms, all other Indian
sectors are trading at a premium to the region,” said Siva, who
has an “underweight” rating on India. “We remain overweight
under-owned markets such as  Thailand  and  Korea ,” she said.  
 Foreigners have invested a net $10.48 billion in Indian
equities this year, adding to more than $17 billion of net
inflows in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Thailand has seen overseas investors withdraw a net
$311.6 million this year while South Korea’s net inflows of
$7.65 billion are 39 percent lower than a year earlier, the data
shows.  
 “If we aggregate net foreign buying over the past three
months, Thailand appears to be the most under-owned market,”
followed by Taiwan and Korea, said Siva, the top-ranked
strategist in Institutional Investor’s 2010 Asian poll.
