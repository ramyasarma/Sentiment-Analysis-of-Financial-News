             The yen advanced against higher-
yielding currencies after Australian reports showed retail  sales 
grew less than economists forecast and home-building approvals
unexpectedly declined.  
 The yen rose to 113.58 per euro as of 11:47 a.m. in Tokyo
from 114.00 in New York yesterday. Japan’s currency gained 0.7
percent to 78.47 per Australian dollar, and climbed 0.2 percent
to 86.32 versus the greenback.
