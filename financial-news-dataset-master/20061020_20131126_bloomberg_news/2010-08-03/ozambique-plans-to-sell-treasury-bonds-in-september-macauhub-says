             The Mozambican government plans to
issue $150 million of Treasury bonds in September, October and
November, the biggest offer since the bank was opened in 1998,
Macauhub reported, citing Mozambican Stock Exchange Chairman
Jussub Nurmamad.  
 The bonds will have a five-year maturity with a variable
interest rate of 14.3 percent to 14.5 percent, Macauhub said.
