             SKS Microfinance Ltd. , the Indian
lender backed by investors including  George Soros , received bids
for 13.5 times the stock available in an initial public offering
that’s seeking to raise as much as $347 million.  
 The company, based in Hyderabad, got 186.4 million bids for
the 13.8 million shares on offer on India’s two primary bourses,
according to data on the National Stock Exchange’s  website 
yesterday. The offer of equity for 850 rupees to 985 rupees
apiece opened on July 28 and ended yesterday.  
 The sale may help SKS, India’s largest microfinance lender,
bolster credit to the nation’s poorest in a market where about
120 million households don’t have access to banking and
financial services, according to Crisil Ratings. The company
attracted anchor investors including funds managed by Morgan
Stanley, BNP Paribas SA and Fidelity Investments.  
 Kotak Mahindra Capital Co., Citigroup Inc. and  Credit
Suisse Group AG  are managing SKS’s share sale.  
 The lender on July 27 sold 3 million shares to so-called
anchor investors, which are institutions required to hold the
shares for at least 30 days, at 985 rupees apiece, according to
an e-mailed statement. Buyers included Soros’s Quantum (M) Ltd.
as well as funds controlled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc.
