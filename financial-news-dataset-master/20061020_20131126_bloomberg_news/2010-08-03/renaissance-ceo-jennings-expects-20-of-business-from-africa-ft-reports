             Renaissance Capital Chief Executive
Officer  Stephen Jennings  said Africa “will account for 20
percent of our business” this year, the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview. Russia will carry on accounting
for about two-thirds, the newspaper said.  
 Jennings said the company is “a little bit behind in North
Africa, but we’ll attack that in the second half of the year,”
the FT reported.
