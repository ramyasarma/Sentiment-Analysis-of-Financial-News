             Research in Motion Ltd. agreed for
the first time to allow Indian security agencies to monitor its
Blackberry services in a bid to avoid a government ban, the
Economic Times reported, citing telecommunications department
documents.  
 The company offered to share technical codes for corporate
e-mail services and open access to all consumer e-mails within
15 days, the daily said. Research in Motion will provide further
details on its proposals to India’s communications ministry
today, the report said.
