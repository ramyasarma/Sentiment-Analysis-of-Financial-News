             Gasoil refining margins in Asia rose
to the highest in a week after crude oil climbed to a three-
month high on optimism the global recovery will spur demand.  
 Gasoil processing profits  climbed 7 cents to $12.53 a barrel
against Dubai crude at 10:05 a.m. Singapore time, according to
data from broker PVM Oil Associates. The spread is at its most
since July 27. September swap contracts for  gasoil  rose $1.62 to
$91.38 a barrel.  
 Refining losses from making naphtha  increased for a second
day, widening 26 cents to a discount of $4.88 a barrel.  Naphtha 
swaps rose $1.29 to $73.97 a barrel. Formosa Petrochemical Corp.
said yesterday that it wants to defer some imports of naphtha
and sour, or high-sulfur, crude after two accidents at its
Mailiao plants last month.  
 Fuel oil ’s discount to the Middle Eastern crude widened 36
cents to $5.77 a barrel.  Swaps for fuel oil  jumped $7.75 to $475
a metric ton.  
 Open-specification naphtha cargoes delivered in the first
half of September were bid at $678 a ton against offers at $681
at 8:39 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from Ginga
Petroleum Singapore Pte.  
 Naphtha  for delivery in September closed at $666.25 a ton
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
