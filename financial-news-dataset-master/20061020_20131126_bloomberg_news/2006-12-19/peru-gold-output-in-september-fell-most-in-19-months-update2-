             Peru 's  gold production  in September
tumbled 9.5 percent, the most in 19 months, led by a plunge at
 Newmont Gold Corp. (NEM) 's Yanacocha mine, the country's biggest source
of the precious metal.  
 Output fell to 16,437 kilograms from a year earlier,
including a 40 percent drop at Yanacocha, because of declining
ore grades, the Energy and Mines Ministry said today in a
statement on its Web site.  Copper output  rose 1.4 percent to
85,074 tons, including gains at Antamina and  Xstrata Plc (XTA) 's
Tintaya mine, the ministry said.  
 Peru, the world's fourth-largest copper producer and fifth-
biggest in gold, is counting on $12 billion in mining exports to
drive economic expansion of 7 percent this year. The Andean
country has benefited from a 50 percent gain in copper prices
from a year ago and a 24 percent rally in gold.  
 ``Everyone keeps exploring, so we hope there will be more
discoveries,'' Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, chief executive office of
 Southern Copper  Corp., the world's fifth-largest copper producer,
told reporters in  Lima  today. ``But all these projects aren't
going to increase output until 2009.''  
 Newmont, based in Denver, is the world's second-biggest gold
producer behind Barrick Gold Corp. The shares rose 66 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $47.23.  
 Silver output rose 5.6 percent to 273,073 kilograms, while
zinc fell 7.5 percent to 97,364 tons, and lead fell 8.3 percent
to 24,447 tons. Tin fell 22 percent, molybdenum fell 4.8 percent,
and iron rose 6.5 percent. Peru is the world's largest silver and
tin producer and third in zinc.  
 Southern Copper  
 Southern Copper aims to invest $250 million next year in
mine expansion, an upgrade of its Ilo smelter and engineering
studies at its Los Chancas and Tia Maria copper deposits,
Gonzalez said. The company also plans to invest $15 million in
exploration in Peru and $20 million each in Mexico and  Chile , he
said.  
 ``We believe prices will remain high next year, but not at
the peaks reached in 2006,'' Gonzalez said. ``Average prices will
probably be slightly less than this year, with copper prices at
around $3 a pound.''  
 Gold for February delivery rose 1.3 percent to $626.10 per
ounce on the Comex Division of the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Copper prices fell 0.2 percent to 3.0165 per pound.
