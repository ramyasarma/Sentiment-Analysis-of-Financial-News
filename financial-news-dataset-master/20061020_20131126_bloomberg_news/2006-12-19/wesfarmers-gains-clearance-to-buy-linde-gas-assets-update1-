             -- Wesfarmers Ltd., whose businesses
range from mining to insurance, gained preliminary clearance from
the antitrust regulator to buy  Linde AG (LIN) 's Australian gas assets
for about A$500 million ($392 million).  
 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission doesn't
intend to oppose the bid, Perth-based Wesfarmers said in a
statement to the Australian Stock Exchange today. The acquisition
still requires formal approval, which is expected to be granted,
the company said.  
 Chief Executive Officer Richard Goyder is making
acquisitions to give scale to existing businesses such as mining
and insurance. He agreed to pay A$700 million for OAMPS Ltd. in
September to add underwriting and broking to the insurance unit.  
 The Linde Australian business produces oxygen, nitrogen,
argon and hydrogen gas and will be run separately to Wesfarmers'
40 percent owned Air Liquide  Australia  business, which also
produces gases for the industrial and medical market.  
 Wesfarmers has complete terms with Linde and expects to
complete the deal in February, the company said.  
 Wesfarmers expects the acquisition will add to  earnings  in
the first year of ownership. Linde Australia had 2005 earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of A$37
million on sales of A$100 million.  
 Wiesbaden, Germany-based Linde is selling the assets to meet
undertakings to Australia's antitrust regulator after its
acquisition of BOC Group Plc.
