             Corus Group Plc, the subject of a
takeover battle between  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  and Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA, would be put to an auction if the offers are still
outstanding before Jan. 30, the U.K. Takeover Panel said.  
 Should a ``competitive situation'' continue to exist shortly
before Jan. 30, the panel may require ``any revised offers to be
published in accordance with an auction procedure,'' it said
today in a statement.  
 Corus said in a separate statement that an extraordinary
shareholder meeting planned for tomorrow was adjourned.  
 CSN has no comment on the subject, Jose Marcos Treiger, the
Brazilian steelmaker's head of  investor relations , said by
telephone from his office in  Sao Paulo .  
 ``This ruling will give us a clear winner by Jan. 30,''
Priya Viswanathan, a credit analyst at Frontline Capital Analysts
Pvt, in Bangalore,  India , said today in an e-mail. ``We continue
to see a greater chance of a CSN buyout, as we believe they are
likely to bid more aggressively than the Tatas.''  
 Brazil's CSN raised its offer for Corus on Dec. 11, to 515
pence a share. That's 3 percent higher than the 500 pence offered
by Tata Steel. Tata initially offered 455 pence a share on Oct.
20, and CSN topped that on Nov. 17.  
 Shares of Corus gained 3.5 pence, or 0.7 percent, to 531.5
pence in London today, valuing the company at 4.78 billion pounds
($9.39 billion). The stock has risen 80 percent this year.
