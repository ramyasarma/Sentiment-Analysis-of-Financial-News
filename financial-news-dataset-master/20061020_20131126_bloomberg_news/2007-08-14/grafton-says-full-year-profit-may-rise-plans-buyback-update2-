             Grafton Group (GN5) , Ireland's biggest
builders' merchant, said full-year profit may rise by as much as
12 percent, underpinned by growth in the U.K.  
 The Dublin-based company is ``comfortable'' with analysts
estimates that earning per share will rise to about 88 cents,
Finance Director Colm O'Nuallain said today in an interview.
Grafton also announced a share buyback program and the stock rose
49 cents, or 5.2 percent, to 9.99 euros in Dublin.  
 Grafton's U.K. business, which accounts for 60 percent of
annual sales, is helping the company withstand a cooling property
market in Ireland. Sales of Grafton's bricks, steel and plumbing
gear are under pressure as eight interest-rate rises in Ireland
since late 2005 curb demand for homes and slow building.  
 ``This is a reassuring statement and will be well
received,'' said John Sheehan of NCB Stockbrokers, who has a
``buy'' recommendation on Grafton shares. ``Grafton has the funds
to contemplate a buyback.''  
 Grafton moved its first-half earnings release to today from
Sept. 11, after shares declined 25 percent on investor concern
that slowing construction on Ireland would hurt profit.  
 ``By announcing our results early, we have given ourselves
the flexibility to buy back shares,'' said O'Nuallain. He
declined to give the price or timing of the buyback.  
 First-half net income dropped to 92.6 million euros from
101.7 million euros after the company posted a 28 million-euro
gain from the sale of property a year earlier. Revenue rose 8
percent to 1.6 billion euros.  
 Operating profit in the first half rose 16 percent to 124.4
million euros. Sales in the U.K. climbed 17 percent in the six-month period. In Ireland, sales advanced 6 percent.  
 Irish home prices fell 2.6 percent in the first half of the
year and construction shrank in July for a second month. Housing
completions will decline to about 65,000 next year from 80,000 in
2007, O'Nuallain said.
