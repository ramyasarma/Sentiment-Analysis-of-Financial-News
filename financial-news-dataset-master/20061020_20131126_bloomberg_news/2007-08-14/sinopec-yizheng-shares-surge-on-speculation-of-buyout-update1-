             Sinopec Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co. (1033) , a
unit of  Asia 's largest refiner, gained the most in almost nine
years in  Hong Kong  trading as some investors speculated the
parent company will offer to buy the stock it doesn't already own.  
 The  stock  jumped as much as 29 percent to HK$3.38 the
biggest gain since September 1998, before closing at HK$3.30.
More than 92 million shares were traded, 89 percent higher than
the three-month average.  
 Parent  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , or Sinopec, bought
the outstanding shares in four listed subsidiaries in February
last year, prompting speculation the company will offer
shareholders in its other units a premium for their stock.  
 ``This is probably caused by a new round of market
speculation that the parent will buy out the unit,'' Grace Liu,
an oil analyst with Guotai Junan Securities Hong Kong Co., said
from the southern city of Shenzhen.  
 Sinopec Yizheng is unaware of any reason for the surge in
its stock price and trading volume, the  chemical fiber producer 
said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today.
``There are no negotiations or agreements related to intended
acquisitions that are discloseable,'' it said.  
 Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co., (338)  another Sinopec unit,
rose as much as 12 percent, the biggest gain in three months,
before closing at HK$4.33 in Hong Kong.
