Solarfun Power Holdings Co., a
Chinese maker of solar components, said its board approved a
change in its name to Hanwha Solar One, after South Korea’s
 Hanwha Chemical Corp.  bought almost half the company.  The change reflects Solarfun’s business relationship with
Hanwha Chemical, which bought a 49.99 percent stake in
September, Solarfun said today in a statement.  Hanwha Chemical said in August that it will pay 434.1
billion won ($376 million) for the Solarfun shares to diversify
its revenue sources.  Shanghai-based Solarfun, which also makes silicon ingots,
wafers, photovoltaic cells and panels, aims to be among the top
three module manufacturers in the world by 2015, said Chief
Executive Officer Peter Xie.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
