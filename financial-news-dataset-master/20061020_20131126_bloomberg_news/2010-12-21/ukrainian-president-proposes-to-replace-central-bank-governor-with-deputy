Ukrainian President  Viktor Yanukovich  sent a request to parliament to replace central bank
Governor  Volodymyr Stelmakh  with  Serhiy Arbuzov , the second in
command at the Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy.  Stelmakh requested his removal, according to a statement on
Yanukovych’s website today. His term was due to end in December
2011. Arbuzov was appointed to the central bank by the president
in September, replacing  Anatoly Shapovalov , a Stelmakh ally. The
change needs the support of 300 of the country’s 450 lawmakers.  Yanukovych won the presidency in February, replacing  Viktor Yushchenko , who appointed Stelmakh in 2004. Former Prime
Minister  Yulia Timoshenko  also tried to oust the central bank
chief during political gridlock that exacerbated the country’s
economic slump and led to an international bailout in 2008.  Arbuzov, 34, was the head of PAO Ukrainskyi Biznes Bank
before becoming Stelmakh’s first deputy. UBB, the country’s 63rd
largest lender according to central bank data, is based in the
eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Yanukovych’s home town.  To contact the reporter on this story:
