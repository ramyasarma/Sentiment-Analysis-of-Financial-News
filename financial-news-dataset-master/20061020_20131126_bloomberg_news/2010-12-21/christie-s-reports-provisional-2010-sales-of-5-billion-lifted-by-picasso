Christie’s International  sold a
record 3.2 billion pounds ($5 billion) of art and other
collectibles in 2010, according to a provisional figure released
today by the London-based auction house.  The total, comprising worldwide auction and private sales,
surpassed the company’s previous high of 3.1 billion pounds for
2007, said Christie’s, which is owned by French billionaire
 Francois Pinault . The provisional 2010 sales rose 52 percent
from 2.1 billion pounds a year earlier.  Sales were boosted by star events such as the $106.5
million paid for  Picasso ’s 1932 painting “Nude, Green Leaves
and Bust” in New York in May, a record for a work of art at
auction, and by surging demand in Hong Kong. On Nov. 29, a 14.23
carat pink diamond fetched HK$179.9 million ($23.2 million) at
Christie’s, the most for a gem in Asia.  Rival auction house Sotheby’s has yet to release annual
figures for 2010. The company totaled $4.2 billion in worldwide
auction sales up to Dec. 13, according to its website. That
doesn’t include private transactions or its final week of
salesroom-based events.  So far, New York-based Sotheby’s top seller for 2010 has
been  Giacometti ’s 1961 bronze, “Walking Man I,” which fetched
65 million pounds at auction in London in February.  Christie’s will release a full breakdown of its 2010
results in January. Sotheby’s “consolidated” figures for the
year will be announced in late February or early March.  ( Scott Reyburn  writes about the art market for Muse, the
