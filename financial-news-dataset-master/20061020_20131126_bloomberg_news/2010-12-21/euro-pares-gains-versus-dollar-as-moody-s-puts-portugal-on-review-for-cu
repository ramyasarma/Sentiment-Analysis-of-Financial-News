The euro pared its gains against the
dollar and the yen after Moody’s Investors Service put
Portugal’s credit rankings on review for a possible downgrade.  The 16-nation currency rose 0.2 percent to $1.3161 as of
8:10 a.m. in London, after rising to $1.3202. The euro
strengthened 0.2 percent to 110.19 yen, down from an increase of
as much as 0.5 percent.  Moody’s placed the nation’s A1 long-term rating and Prime-1
short-term rating on review, it said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
