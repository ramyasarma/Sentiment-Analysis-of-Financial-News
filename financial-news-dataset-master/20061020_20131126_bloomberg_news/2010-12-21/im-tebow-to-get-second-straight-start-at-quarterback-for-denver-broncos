Rookie  Tim Tebow  will start his
second straight game at quarterback for the Denver Broncos
as  Kyle Orton  continues to recover from a rib injury.  Tebow, who has the National Football League’s top-
selling jersey this season, passed for 138 yards and a
touchdown in Denver’s 39-23 loss to Oakland two days ago.
He also rushed for 78 yards and another score.  “He did a lot of the things we have always thought he
could do,” Broncos interim coach  Eric Studesville  said
yesterday in a news conference. “He made plays scrambling
and running the ball. Even though we did not throw it a lot
of times, he did make some nice throws and completions that
we needed.”  The Broncos host the Houston Texans on Dec. 26, having
lost nine of their past 10 games.  Studesville informed the team of his decision to start
Tebow, 23, because Orton’s bruised ribs have shown little
improvement. Tebow, who won the 2007 Heisman Trophy as
college football’s best player, wasn’t named the starter
against Oakland until Sunday.  “We just felt that prolonging this later into the
week was not the best thing for our preparation and
practice,” Studesville said. At 3-11 overall, the Broncos
are tied with Cincinnati for the second-worst record in the
NFL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
