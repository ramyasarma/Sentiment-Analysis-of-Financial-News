Citigroup Inc. -affiliated insurance
agencies paid $2 million in fines for duping consumers of
retirement and wealth-management products, a New York State
regulator said.  A review of Citicorp Insurance Agency Inc., Citicorp
Investment Services, and SBHU Life Agency Inc. found clients had
their policies or contracts replaced after receiving inaccurate
or insufficient information about the products and fees, the
state Insurance Department said today in an e-mailed statement.  “This major fine reflects the seriousness of these
violations,” Superintendent  James Wrynn  said in the statement.
“It is imperative that consumers, especially seniors, receive a
full explanation of the pros and cons of replacing a life
insurance policy or annuity contract so they are not financially
harmed.”  The agencies agreed to address violations, fix their
complaint processes and file reports with the department
outlining their efforts, Wrynn said. Citigroup, based in New
York, is the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets.  “We are pleased to have this matter resolved,” Citigroup
said in a statement. “The examination, which covered activity
between 2003 and 2007, found certain inadvertent violations and
other issues under the Insurance Law and Department Regulations.
We have taken appropriate steps to address the Department’s
concerns.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
