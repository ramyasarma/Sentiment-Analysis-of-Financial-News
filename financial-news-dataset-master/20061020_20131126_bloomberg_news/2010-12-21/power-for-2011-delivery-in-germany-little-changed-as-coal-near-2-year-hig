German electricity for delivery next
year was little changed as coal prices traded near a two-year
high, potentially making electricity generation more expensive.  Baseload power for 2011 gained 15 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
50.15 euros ($65.85) a megawatt-hour, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg at 5:51 p.m. Berlin time. The contract
expires on Dec. 31. Baseload is delivered around the clock.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp yesterday rose as high as $119 a metric ton, its highest
in two years after rain disrupted supplies in Indonesia,
Australia and Colombia, pushing up spot prices. It traded at
$116.25 today. The fuel accounted for 18 percent of Germany’s
power generation last year. The country also gets electricity
from lignite, or brown coal, as well as from nuclear plants and
wind and solar power.  Utilities including E.ON AG and RWE AG, Germany’s two
biggest, would make a profit of 1.43 euros a megawatt-hour by
burning coal at power plants to generate electricity, taking the
cost of the fuel and carbon emissions into account. The so-
called  clean dark spread , based on 2011 prices, closed yesterday
at 1.21 euros, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Germany’s adjusted power use rose 3.7 percent in October
from a year earlier and gained 4 percent in the first 10 months
on the same period of 2009, UBS AG said in a research note,
citing utility group BDEW in Berlin.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including GFI
Group Inc., ICAP Plc, Tradition and Spectron Group Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
