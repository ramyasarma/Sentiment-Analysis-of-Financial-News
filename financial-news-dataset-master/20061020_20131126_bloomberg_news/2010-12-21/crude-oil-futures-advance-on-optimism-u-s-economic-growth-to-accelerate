Oil traded near the highest in two
weeks on speculation that economic growth in the U.S. will
accelerate next year, bolstering demand in the world’s biggest
crude-consuming country.  Futures earlier rose as much as 0.5 percent before data
tomorrow that may show U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a
faster pace than economists’ estimates. Oil stockpiles decreased
for a third week, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
analysts before an Energy Department report tomorrow.  “The economic situation can support the upside further,
although liquidation of long positions may be possible with no
change in fundamentals,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a Tokyo-based
commodity derivative sales manager at Newedge, a brokerage. “I
don’t think we can see much direction during the week, which
means continuing range-bound trade between $87 and $90.”  Crude for February delivery was at $89.49 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 12
cents, at 2:50 p.m. Singapore time. It rose as much as 40 cents
to $89.77. Yesterday, the January contract expired after gaining
0.9 percent to $88.81. Futures reached $90.76 on Dec. 7, the
highest since October 2008.  U.S. GDP grew 2.8 percent in the third quarter, up from an
estimate of 2.5 percent last month, based on the median forecast
of 69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before a Commerce
Department report.  Crude Supplies  Oil, which rallied 78 percent in 2009, has advanced 13
percent this year on signs of a global economic recovery and as
stockpiles decreased.  U.S.  crude inventories  probably fell last week as refiners
on the Gulf Coast reduced their assets for tax savings at the
end of the year, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Stockpiles dropped 3.5 million barrels in the seven days
ended Dec. 17 from 346 million, based on the median  estimate  of
seven analysts before tomorrow’s report. Supplies in the
previous week slumped 9.85 million, the most since May 2008, as
imports fell.  Gasoline inventories may have increased by a median 1.5
million barrels from 214.8 million, the survey showed.
Distillate fuel stockpiles, including heating oil and diesel,
were probably unchanged last week at 161.3 million.  Brent crude for February settlement was at $92.75 a barrel,
up 1 cent, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Yesterday, the contract climbed 1.2 percent to $92.74, the
highest settlement since Oct. 1, 2008.  Gasoline, Gasoil  Gasoline extended gains after climbing to a seven-month
high yesterday as Hovensa LLC worked to repair a fuel-making
unit that serves the U.S. East Coast, closed since Dec. 9.  The fluid catalytic cracker at St. Croix, the largest
refinery in the Caribbean, has a capacity of 150,000 barrels a
day. It supplies motor fuel and blending components to markets
including New York Harbor, the delivery point for New York
gasoline futures.  Gasoline for January delivery climbed as much as 0.3
percent to $2.3856 a gallon. Yesterday, it rose 6 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $2.3778, the highest settlement since May 3.  “Now that gasoline prices have broken to the upside, we
have to expect heating oil and crude oil prices to follow,”
 Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover Inc., an energy
adviser in New Canaan, Connecticut, said in a note.  Gasoil increased for the first time in three days amid
below-normal temperatures in parts of Europe and heavy snow that
continued to disrupt air travel. ICE Futures gasoil for January
delivery rose as much as 1.3 percent to $774 a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
