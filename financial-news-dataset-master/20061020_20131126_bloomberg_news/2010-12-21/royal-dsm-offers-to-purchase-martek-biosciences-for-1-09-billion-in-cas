Royal DSM NV, the world’s largest
maker of vitamins, agreed to buy Martek Biosciences Corp. for
$1.09 billion to add a U.S. maker of ingredients for baby food.  DSM is offering shareholders of Martek $31.50 a share in
cash, 35 percent higher than Martek’s closing price yesterday,
the Heerlen, Netherlands-based company said in a statement
today. DSM will finance the acquisition from its existing cash
and Martek will add to earnings per share immediately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
