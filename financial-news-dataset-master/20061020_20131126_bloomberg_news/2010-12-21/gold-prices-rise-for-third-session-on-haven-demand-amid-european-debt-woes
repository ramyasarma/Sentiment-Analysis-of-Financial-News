Gold prices rose for the third
straight session on speculation that Europe’s debt woes will
spread, boosting demand for the precious metal as a store of
value.  The euro fell against the dollar after Fitch Ratings said
it may lower Greece’s credit rating to below investment grade.
Gold has gained 27 percent this year, reaching an all-time high
of $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7, as Europe’s debt crisis
escalated.  “Sovereign-debt worries continue to weigh on the market,”
said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago. “Gold looks to move higher in the new year.”  Gold futures for February rose $2.70, or 0.2 percent, to
settle at $1,388.80 at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
price gained 1.1 percent in the previous two sessions.  The metal is headed for a 10th straight annual gain amid
low interest rates in the U.S. and rising commodity demand in
China. Investment in 10 leading exchange-traded  funds  backed by
gold has climbed 18 percent this year.  “There’s still a backdrop of sovereign debt in Europe and
inflation in China that will keep gold well bid,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in
Chicago.  Gains may be limited for the rest of the year, he said.  “We’re looking at a shallow correction in prices over the
next two weeks,” Klopfenstein said. “Those who have caught a
nice run in gold are looking to book profit.”  Silver futures for March delivery rose 3.9 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $29.394 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has jumped
74 percent this year.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose $8.30, or 1.1
percent, to $753.05 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Platinum futures for April delivery climbed $11.40, or 0.7
percent, to $1,727.10 an ounce.  Palladium has surged 84 percent this year. and platinum is
up 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
