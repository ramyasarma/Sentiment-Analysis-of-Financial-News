Job markets on both sides of the
Atlantic may need another five years to recover from their
current slump, according to  Dhaval Joshi , chief strategist at
RAB Capital Plc.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares indexes of the total number
of hours worked in the U.S. and U.K., as compiled by the Labor
Department and the Office for National Statistics, respectively.
Both gauges were adjusted for population changes, as Joshi did
in a report yesterday.  These indicators failed to rebound in the past two years as
U.S.  unemployment  held above 9 percent and the U.K. rate, based
on the International Labor Organization’s methodology, stayed
near 8 percent.  “The current level of joblessness appears to be the
tolerable limit of pain and equates to the economies operating
around 6 percent below capacity,”  Joshi  wrote.  Even so, he estimated that spending in the two countries
exceeds “sustainable production” by about 30 percent of gross
domestic product because of earlier economic booms. “The jobs
markets could be in a parlous state for five more years,” he
wrote, as the imbalance is resolved.  This prospect suggests declines in U.S. and U.K. government
bonds are “buying opportunities,” not the start of bear
markets, Joshi said. Losses in the current quarter caused yields
to rise 83 basis points on 10-year Treasury notes and 53 basis
points on 10-year  gilts  through yesterday. A basis point equals
0.01 percentage point.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
