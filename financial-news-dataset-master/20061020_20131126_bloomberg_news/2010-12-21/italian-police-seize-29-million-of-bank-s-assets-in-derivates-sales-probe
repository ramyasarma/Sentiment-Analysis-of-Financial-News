Italy’s finance police today seized
22 million euros of assets from Italian and foreign banks as
part of a probe into alleged fraud in the sale of derivatives to

three other municipalities 123 million euros, the finance police
said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
