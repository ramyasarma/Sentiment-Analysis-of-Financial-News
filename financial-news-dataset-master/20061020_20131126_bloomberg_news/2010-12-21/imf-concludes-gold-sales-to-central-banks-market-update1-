The International Monetary Fund said
it concluded the planned sale of about 13 percent of its gold
reserves to central banks and to market participants.  The institution agreed in September 2009 to dispose of
403.3 metric tons of bullion as part of a plan to shore up its
finances and lend at reduced rates to low-income countries. More
than half of the gold amount was acquired by the central banks
of India, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, according to past
announcements.  “The gold sales were conducted under modalities to
safeguard against disruption of the gold market,” the IMF said
in an e-mailed statement today. “All gold sales were at market
prices, including direct sales to official holders,” it said,
without disclosing the total sum raised by the institution.  Spokesman  William Murray  said the amount obtained from the
sales will be reflected in coming financial statements. Gold
prices have surged 27 percent in 2010, heading for a 10th
straight annual gain. The metal touched a record $1,432.50 an
ounce on Dec. 7 on the Comex in New York, closing today at
$1,388.80.  The IMF received $7.15 billion from its sales of 212 tons
to the central banks of India, Mauritius and Sri Lanka in 2009
and $403 million from a sale of 10 tons to Bangladesh this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
