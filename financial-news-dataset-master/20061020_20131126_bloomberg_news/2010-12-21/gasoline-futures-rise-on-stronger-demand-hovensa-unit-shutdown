Gasoline advanced on speculation
that fuel demand will rise because of the Christmas holidays and
as the continued shutdown of a key gasoline-making unit
threatened to tighten supplies in the U.S. East Coast market.  Futures gained as Hovensa LLC worked to repair the 150,000-
barrel-a-day fluid catalytic cracker at its St. Croix refinery,
the largest in the Caribbean. The plant supplied 139,000 barrels
a day of finished gasoline and blending components in September
to the East Coast, which includes New York Harbor, the delivery
point for the New York Mercantile Exchange gasoline contract.  “Gasoline seems to be paying attention to the refineries,
and we’re hearing there is a tightness in New York Harbor and
some of the cargos have not shown up,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
“And there’s the expectation the recovery is proceeding well.”  Gasoline for January delivery rose 0.95 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.3873 a gallon at 11:10 a.m. on the Nymex. Prices
touched $2.395, the highest intraday level for the front-month
contract since May 4. Futures have advanced 5.4 percent this
month.  U.S. gross domestic product grew 2.8 percent in the third
quarter, up from an estimate of 2.5 percent last month, based on
the median forecast of 69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The Commerce Department is scheduled to release its GDP estimate
at 10:30 a.m. in Washington tomorrow.  The St. Croix refinery expects to finish repairs on the
unit by Dec. 25, according to people familiar with refinery
operations who declined to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak for the plant. Hovensa has declined to
speculate when the work will be completed.  Padd 1 Supplies  Supplies of gasoline in Padd 1, which includes New York
Harbor, the delivery point of the Nymex contract, were 9 percent
below a year earlier in the week ended Dec. 10, according to the
Energy Department.  Total U.S.  gasoline demand , measured by what refiners and
blenders provide to wholesalers, reached a seven-week high.  “There’s pretty low capacity, there’s a lot of enthusiasm
over economic growth and there was a strong demand number last
week that everyone is riding,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst
with Energy Security Analysis Inc in Wakefield, Massachusetts.  U.S. gasoline inventories probably rose 1.5 million barrels
last week, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg News. Refinery use was unchanged at 88
percent.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report inventories
for the week ended Dec. 17 at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  The premium of gasoline over crude oil, or the crack
spread, based on February contracts, widened 27 cents to $10.10
a barrel.  Heating oil for January delivery gained 1.07 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.5002 a gallon. The crack spread, based on
February contracts, widened 26 cents to $16.05 a barrel.  The premium of heating oil over gasoline increased 0.12
cent to 11.29 cents a gallon. It was 17.43 cents on Dec. 15.  Regular gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.2
cent to $2.983 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
