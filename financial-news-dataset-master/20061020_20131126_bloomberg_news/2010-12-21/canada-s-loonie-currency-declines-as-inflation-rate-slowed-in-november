The Canadian dollar traded near the
lowest level in almost three weeks versus its U.S. counterpart
as a report showing slower inflation overshadowed another that
said retail sales rose more than forecast.  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, fell versus 11 of
its 16 major peers. It pared losses as stocks and crude oil, the
nation’s biggest export, rose. The consumer price index
increased less than economists anticipated, bolstering bets that
the central bank will keep interest rates on hold.  “The CPI number wasn’t enough to change perceptions of the
Bank of Canada, and the retail sales number, which might have
caused a little bit more Canadian dollar strength, actually had
a little bit of a squishy undertone,” said  David Watt , senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital unit
in Toronto. “We’re still weaker than yesterday’s close, but
it’s pretty tightly packed around that closing level.”  Canada’s dollar depreciated less than 0.1 percent to
C$1.0171 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with
C$1.0168 yesterday, when it reached C$1.0209, the weakest level
since Dec. 1. Earlier today it retreated as much as 0.4 percent
to C$1.0207. One Canadian dollar buys 98.31 U.S. cents.  Consumer  prices  advanced 2 percent in November from a year
earlier after a 2.4 percent gain in October, Statistics Canada
said today in Ottawa. The  median forecast  of 22 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 2.2 percent pace.  ‘Soft Patch’  “We’re seeing signs that Canada hit its own soft patch
late in the third quarter, early in the fourth quarter,” RBC’s
Watt said in a phone interview. “We’re seeing a pullback in
bullishness through the turn of the year, so that could be
weighing on the currency.”  Retail sales rose 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted
C$36.6 billion ($35.9 billion), another statistics agency report
showed. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a 0.5 percent
increase, according to the median of 21 estimates.  “The data is somewhat offsetting today,”  Michael Leavitt ,
a Montreal-based institutional-derivatives broker at MF Global
Canada Co., said via e-mail. “Neither one is showing a
particular trend.”  Yields on the June 2011 bankers’ acceptances contract, a
gauge of expectations for short-term borrowing costs, dropped as
much as three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.53
percent, indicating traders are paring bets for future interest-
rate increases. The yield was 1.58 percent at the end of last
week and 1.70 percent on Nov. 29.  Interest-Rate Bets  So-called Bax contracts average about 20 basis points above
the central bank’s overnight target, Bloomberg data since 1992
show. Hedge funds and money managers use the contracts to hedge
against interest-rate changes and make bets.  “There’s no rush for the bank to move anytime soon,”
 Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion
Bank’s TD Securities unit, said by phone from Toronto. “It
should perhaps undercut the Canadian dollar a little bit.”  The Bank of Canada, which next meets Jan. 18, left its
target  interest rate  at 1 percent on Dec. 7 for a second
straight time to gauge the global economic recovery after three
increases. The U.S. Federal Reserve has held its benchmark rate
in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The Canadian central bank’s overnight rate will hold steady
through the end of March 2011 and then rise to 1.25 percent by
June 30 and 1.5 percent by the end of September, according to
the weighted average of 23 forecasts by economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  Approached Parity  Canada’s currency, called the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, appreciated to C$1.0001 on Dec.
15, the strongest level since it last traded on a one-for-one
basis with the U.S. dollar on Nov. 11. It was within one cent of
parity every day from Dec. 2 through Dec. 17.  “We’ve had a breakout technically from the narrow range
we’ve been trading in the last few weeks, between par on the
downside and C$1.0140 on the topside,” TD’s Osborne said. That
“really suggests we should be trading up to the highs we had in
late November, so around C$1.0275.”  Government bonds rose, pushing the 10-year note’s  yield 
down as much as three basis points to 3.13 percent. It touched
3.125 percent yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 6. The
price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June 2020
increased 17 cents to C$102.91. Canada’s government bonds have
lost 0.2 percent this month, trimming their gain for the year to
5.9 percent, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  Crude oil for February delivery rose 1.3 percent to $89.99
a barrel in New York. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.6
percent.  Toronto-Dominion Bank agreed to buy Chrysler Financial
Corp. from Cerberus Capital Management LP for $6.3 billion in
cash, adding an auto-finance company in the second-largest U.S.
acquisition by a Canadian bank. It ranked behind TD’s $8.33
billion deal for Commerce Bancorp Inc. in 2008, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
