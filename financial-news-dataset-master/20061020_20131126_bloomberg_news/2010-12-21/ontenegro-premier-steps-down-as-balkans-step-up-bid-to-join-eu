Montenegro’s Prime Minister  Milo Djukanovic  stepped down after two decades in power, a move his
opponents said may pave the way for speedier progress toward
European Union membership.  Djukanovic will be succeeded by his deputy, Finance
Minister  Igor Luksic , the government’s press office in the
capital, Podgorica, said today in a statement. The new
administration’s focus will be on starting accession talks with
the EU and reducing the Balkan country’s budget deficit to
within EU limits next year, it said.  Djukanovic, who first became premier in January 1991, is
the last politician in the Balkans to have survived the breakup
of Yugoslavia, leading the smallest republic of the former
Yugoslav federation to independence from Serbia in 2006. The
U.K.’s Independent’s newspaper said on May 19 that he was among
the 20 wealthiest political leaders in the world.  The EU last week said Montenegro was eligible for future
membership of the bloc, while stopping short of giving it a date
for the start of entry talks.  Luksic, who is to be confirmed as the new government leader
in parliament next week, will need to lead Montenegro back to
economic growth after the global recession took its toll on
tourism, real estate and aluminum revenues, the main sources of
pre-crisis growth.  He also aims to reduce the budget deficit to 2.6 percent of
gross domestic product in 2011 from 4 percent of GDP this year,
the press office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
