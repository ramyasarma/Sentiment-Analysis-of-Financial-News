China’s appetite for oil, which
helped drive crude to the highest level since October 2008, may
ease next year as the government takes steps to tackle inflation
and work on expanding refineries slows.  The nation, the world’s biggest oil consumer behind the
U.S., may import 5.1 million barrels a day in 2011, up 6.3
percent from this year, according to the average of six analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. That compares with a 20 percent
jump so far in 2010.  China’s  inflation  accelerated to the fastest pace in 28
months in November, fueling speculation the government will
raise interest rates next year. Higher borrowing costs may
reduce the country’s sway over global commodity markets,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chinese gross domestic
product will grow 9.2 percent next year, compared with 10
percent in 2010, a Bloomberg survey of 17 economists showed.  “Chinese policy makers will continue to tighten monetary
supply and manage inflation risks, and that may result in a
slower rate of growth in oil imports,” said  Victor Shum , a
senior principal at energy consultant Purvin & Gertz Inc. in
Singapore. “Even with more modest growth, China will still be
market leading global oil demand.”  Oil surpassed $90 a barrel for the first time in more than
two years on Dec. 7 amid evidence that China, India, Brazil and
Russia will lead the global recovery, fanning demand for fuel.
Crude for February delivery was down 1 cent at $89.36 a barrel
at 9:37 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures are up
to 13 percent this year.  Monetary Policy  Consumer prices surged 5.1 percent in November compared
with a year earlier, the statistics bureau in Beijing said on
Dec. 11, increasing the likelihood the People’s Bank of China
will boost borrowing costs. The central bank raised interest
rates on Oct. 19 for the first time since 2007.  The Chinese authorities “‘are raising rates, they are
battling inflation,”  Jeffrey Currie , head of commodities
research at Goldman Sachs, said at a conference in London on
Nov. 24. “When we look into 2011, the story is not going to be
China. It is going to be Europe and the U.S.”  China will still account for more than a third of world
demand growth next year, according to the  International Energy
Agency . Consumption will increase by 500,000 barrels a day, the
Paris-based group said in its monthly oil market report Dec. 10,
compared with a global rate of 1.4 million barrels a day. North
American demand will be unchanged while Europe’s will shrink by
100,000 barrels a day, it said.  Seaborne Imports  China, the world’s second-largest importer of crude by sea,
boosted purchases 16 percent to 4.4 million barrels a day in the
past year, according to Clarkson Research Services Ltd., a unit
of London-based Clarkson Plc, the world’s biggest  shipbroker .
U.S.-bound shipments grew 2 percent while Japan’s imports rose
by 1 percent. Cargoes to the European Union shrank by 2 percent.  Slowing imports may have most impact on Saudi Arabia and
Angola, China’s biggest  suppliers.  Saudi Arabia shipped 36.7
million metric tons to China in the first 10 months of the year,
about 19 percent of its foreign purchases, according to Chinese
government data. Angola, the second-biggest source, sent 33.7
million tons. Iran sold 17.2 million tons.  Demand for oil in China may also be hurt as refiners
including  PetroChina Co.  and  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. 
reduce processing rates and build fewer plants.  Processing Rates  Crude refining rates climbed to a record in November as a
diesel shortage that left at least 2,000 gas stations without
supplies prompted plants to maximize output and postpone
maintenance operations. The shortfall has since eased, Zhang
Dafu, the chairman of the Jinling refinery run by China
Petroleum, said Dec. 9.  Processing  rose 10 percent to 36.7 million tons last month,
or 8.96 million barrels a day, according to China Mainland
Marketing Research Co., which compiles data for the National
Bureau of Statistics. That exceeded the record 8.76 million
barrels a day reached the previous month.  About 9 million barrels of crude may be processed daily in
China next year, bringing the utilization rate of available
capacity down to 64 percent from 67 percent in 2010, data from
 UOB-Kay Hian Ltd.  show.  Chinese refining capacity may expand by 400,000 barrels a
day in 2011, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of five analysts. China National Petroleum Corp.,
PetroChina’s parent, said in February it expected growth of more
than 630,000 barrels a day in 2010.  China Petrochemical Corp., the parent company of  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , or Sinopec, added 70.8 million tons
of annual refining capacity from 2006 to 2010, or about 14
million tons a year on average, according to Oilchem.net, an
industry portal. The company built 10.5 million tons of
additional capacity in the second half of this year and will add
8.6 million tons in the whole of 2011, Oilchem.net said.  -- Chua Baizhen  in Beijing and  Winnie Zhu  in Shanghai. With
