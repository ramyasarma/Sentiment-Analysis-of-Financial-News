Terrell Owens  of the Cincinnati
Bengals will miss the final two games of the National Football
League season after surgery on his left knee, the team said in a
statement.  Owens, a six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver, had surgery on
the knee yesterday and will finish the season on the injured
reserve list, Bengals spokesman  Jack Brennan  said in a telephone
interview. Orthopedist  James Andrews  performed the surgery,
Brennan said.  Owens was injured in the Bengals’ 19-17 victory over the
Cleveland Browns on Dec. 19. A year after making the playoffs,
the Bengals are 3-11.  Owens, 37, signed a one-year deal with a $2 million base
salary at the beginning of training camp and will be a free
agent at the end of the year. In 14 games this season, he has 72
receptions for 983 yards and nine touchdowns, leading the
Bengals in all three categories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
