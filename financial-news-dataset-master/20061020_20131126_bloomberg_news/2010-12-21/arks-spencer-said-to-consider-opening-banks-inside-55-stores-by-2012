Marks & Spencer Group Plc,  the
U.K.’s largest clothing retailer, is considering opening banks
inside 55 stores as part of its tie-up with  HSBC Holdings Plc ,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The outlets would give customers access to banking services
at the selected stores by 2012, said the person, who declined to
be identified because the plan is still at an early stage. Marks
& Spencer spokeswoman  Clare Wilkes  declined to comment.  Marks & Spencer, which has more than 21 million customers a
week, offers foreign exchange services at about 100 stores,
while products such as credit cards, loans and insurance are
only available online or by phone.  In offering banking at stores, Marks & Spencer will compete
with  Tesco Plc , the country’s largest supermarket chain, which
offers loans and insurance at its outlets. Cheshunt, England-
based Tesco also plans to introduce mortgages in the first half
of next year and customer bank accounts in the second half of
fiscal 2012, Finance Director  Laurie McIlwee  has said.  London-based Marks & Spencer sold M&S Money to HSBC in 2004
for 762 million pounds ($1.18 billion) as part of a cash-raising
exercise to help fend off a hostile takeover bid by billionaire
 Philip Green . The retailer still receives half the unit’s profit
after some costs. Its share of earnings in the fiscal year ended
April 3 was 30.4 million pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
