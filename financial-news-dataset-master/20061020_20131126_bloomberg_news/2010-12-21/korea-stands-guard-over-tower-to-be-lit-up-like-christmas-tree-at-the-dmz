A 30 meter (100 foot) tower that’s
been hung with lights in the shape of a Christmas tree will be
defended against possible attack from the North, Defense
Minister  Kim Kwan Jin  told lawmakers in Seoul today.  “We’ll retaliate decisively to take out the source of any
shelling,” Kim said at a National Assembly defense committee
meeting.  The planned lighting of the tower near the border is part
of “psychological warfare” between the two countries, South
Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported on Dec. 15. Kim said
the significance of the tree, which was decorated by a South
Korean church, is religious, not political.  The tower hasn’t been lit up since 2004, according to the
Korean-language newspaper report. North Korea, which suffers
from energy shortages and relies on outside handouts to feed its
24 million people, had demanded the tower be demolished,
JoongAng said at the time.  South Korea in May began radio broadcasts that can be heard
in North Korea, ending a six-year moratorium on propaganda,
after an international panel concluded the North torpedoed the
warship Cheonan, killing 46 sailors.  North Korea yesterday held back from acting on a threat to
retaliate against South Korea artillery drills held on an island
in disputed waters along the two nation’s western sea border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
