Continental AG , Europe’s second-
biggest car-parts maker, said it’s still targeting a merger with
majority shareholder Schaeffler Group after Manager-Magazin
reported the company dropped plans for a combination.  “Our goal is still a possible combination of both
companies, for which we are preparing,”  Hannes Boekhoff , a
spokesman for Hanover, Germany-based Continental, said in an e-
mailed statement today. “We regularly run through possible
options which enable the optimal form of combining because we
are convinced that both companies will profit from that.”  Schaeffler, the world’s second-biggest maker of roller-
bearings, directly and indirectly holds a 75 percent stake in
Continental after a hostile takeover in 2008. The companies have
intensified cooperation in purchasing and development and have
said a merger may start as early as late next year.  Continental’s supervisory board chairman  Wolfgang Reitzle 
advocated that Schaeffler’s shareholding be reduced to 35
percent in the long term, Manager-Magazin reported today.  A stake reduction to 35 percent is “entirely made up and
has never been discussed,” Reitzle said in the statement. There
is no concrete timeframe for a combination that’s been agreed
upon with Schaeffler, Continental said.  Schaeffler spokesman  Marcus Brans  declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
