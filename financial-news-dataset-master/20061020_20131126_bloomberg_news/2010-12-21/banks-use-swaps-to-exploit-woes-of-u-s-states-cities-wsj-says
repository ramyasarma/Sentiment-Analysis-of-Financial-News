The worsening finances of U.S.
states and cities offer banks the opportunity to profit by means
of credit derivatives, the Wall-Street Journal reported.  UBS AG has started making markets in credit-default swaps
linked to municipal bonds and other securities; sellers of the
swaps are obliged to compensate buyers if a city or state
government misses an interest payment or reorganizes its debt,

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan
Stanley met in New York to discuss standardized paperwork for
“muni CDSs,” the Journal said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
