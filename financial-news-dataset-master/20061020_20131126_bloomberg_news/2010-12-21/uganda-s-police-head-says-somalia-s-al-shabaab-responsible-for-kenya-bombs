Somalia’s al-Shabaab Islamist group,
which claimed responsibility for a July bomb attack in Uganda,
was likely to be responsible for an explosion yesterday at a bus
terminal in neighboring Kenya, Kale Kayihura, Uganda’s inspector
general of police, told reporters in Kampala today.  The explosion took place as passengers boarded a bus due to
travel to Kampala, the Ugandan capital, from Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
