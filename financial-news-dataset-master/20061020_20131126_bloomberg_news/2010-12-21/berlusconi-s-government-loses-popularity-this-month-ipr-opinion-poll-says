Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi’s government popularity fell to 24 percent from 27
percent this month, IPR marketing polls showed.  Confidence in the billionaire premier among Italians was
stable at 35 percent, Rome-based IPR said today. The monthly
polls, which measure voting intentions, surveyed 1,000 adults
each between Dec. 15 and Dec. 19.  Berlusconi survived a confidence vote on Dec. 14.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
