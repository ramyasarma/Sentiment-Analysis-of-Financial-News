Ghana’s currency, the cedi, may
continue to weaken against the U.S. dollar until mid-January,
when aid organizations resume dollar sales.  “Most of the NGOs who were coming in have halted selling
dollars,” Biggles Joseph Amponsah, a currency trader with
 Access Bank Plc  in Accra, said in a telephone interview. Ghana’s
currency “might go on depreciating until the third week of next
month” if it doesn’t reverse its slide against the U.S. dollar
before year-end.  The cedi slumped 1 percent to 1.4785 against the dollar as
of 12:51 p.m. today, according to Access Bank data.  Amponsah forecast the cedi will fall to 1.4890 against the
dollar by Dec. 24. NGOs and mining companies operating in Ghana
who finance their local operations with dollars have largely
stopped buying cedis during the holiday season, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
