Germany’s solar energy industry is
open to accelerating part of a reduction in subsidies should
installations grow too quickly, a lobby group said.  A portion of a planned cut in guaranteed prices for solar
power could be moved forward to mid-2011 from the beginning of
2012,  Carsten Koernig , head of the BSW German industry lobby,
told Focus magazine. The 13 percent reduction planned for solar
capacity added in 2012 could widen to 21 percent depending on
how many panels are installed in 2011, Koernig said. His
comments were confirmed by David Wedepohl, a BSW spokesman.  German consumers subsidize power from renewable sources as
the government seeks to reduce carbon-dioxide output and promote
solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing. Public acceptance of
that model may be at risk as household electricity bills rise on
a jump in solar installations, according to the ZEW Center for
European Economic Research.  Koernig didn’t specify the level of 2012 cuts the German
solar industry would support moving to mid-2011. Guaranteed
tariffs for panels installed next year are scheduled to be cut
by 13 percent on Jan. 1 as part of the country’s renewable
energy law, which successively reduces aid to the industry.  Some 7 to 8 gigawatts of solar capacity will be added in
Germany this year, according to Wedepohl. That compares with a
“healthy” growth rate of 3 to 5 gigawatts a year in the period
to 2020, he said, without specifying what amount the BSW expects
to be installed in 2011.  Germany pared subsidies more than planned this year after
panel prices tumbled, leading to a glut in the German market and
rising electricity costs for consumers.  German households will pay 3.53 euro cents per kilowatt-
hour of consumed electricity in renewable energy subsidies next
year, up from 2.05 cents in 2010, Germany’s four power
transmission grid operators said in October. One kilowatt-hour
is enough to power a 100-watt light bulb for 10 hours.  The government wants to boost the share of renewable energy
to at least 30 percent of gross power output by 2020, according
to the Environment Ministry’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
