The Dallas Cowboys ruled out a
return this season of quarterback  Tony Romo , who broke his
collarbone on Oct. 25 against the New York Giants.  Romo was placed on the team’s injured reserve list,
officially ending his season and opening a spot on the Cowboys’
roster,  Rich Dalrymple , a spokesman for the Cowboys, said in an
e-mail.  Romo, 30, fractured his left clavicle in a 41-35 loss to
Giants that dropped the Cowboys’ record to 1-5. The team had
said it expected his rehabilitation to take six to eight weeks.  Backup quarterback  Jon Kitna  led the team to a 4-4 record
that has the Cowboys at 5-9 with two games remaining in the
National Football League season: at the Arizona Cardinals on
Dec. 25 and at the Philadelphia Eagles on Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
