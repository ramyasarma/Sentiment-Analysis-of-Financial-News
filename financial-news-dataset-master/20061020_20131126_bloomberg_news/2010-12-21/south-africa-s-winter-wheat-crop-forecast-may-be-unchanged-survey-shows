South Africa will probably leave its
forecast for the country’s winter-wheat harvest unchanged, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  The government may say that farmers will reap 1.57 million
metric tons of the grain, the same as projected last month,
according to the median estimate of eight traders surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Forecasts ranged from 1.52 million tons to 1.57
million tons.  The government’s  Crop Estimates Committee  is scheduled to
release its fifth forecast for the winter crop today at 3:30
p.m. Johannesburg time.  Wheat for March delivery, the most active contract on the
South African Futures Exchange, fell 1 rand, or less than 0.1
percent, to 2,837 rand ($416) a ton at the 12 p.m. close in
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
