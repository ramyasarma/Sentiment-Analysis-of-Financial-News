Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., the
largest homebuilder in New Jersey, reported a fourth-quarter
loss bigger than analysts expected as revenue fell 19 percent.  The  net loss  for the quarter ended Oct. 31 narrowed to
$132.1 million, or $1.68 a share, from $250.8 million, or $3.21,
a year earlier, the Red Bank-based builder said in a statement
yesterday. The  average estimate  of eight analysts in a Bloomberg
survey was for a loss of 91 cents a share.  Builders have struggled to attract buyers since the
expiration of a federal tax credit for homebuyers in April as
foreclosures mount and unemployment lingers at almost 10
percent. Building permits, an indicator for future construction,
dropped 4 percent last month to the lowest level since April
2009, Commerce Department figures showed Dec. 16.  “The sector and this company have been through difficult
times, and it’s not over yet,” said  Robert Curran , a
homebuilding analyst at Fitch Ratings in New York.  Hovnanian’s revenue fell to $353 million from $437.4
million a year earlier. Net contracts for homes dropped 13
percent to 1,078.  Hovnanian, which has posted three straight quarterly
losses, reported its only quarterly profit since 2006 in March
because of a change in the tax code that provided builders with
higher benefits.  The company announced the results after the close of
regular U.S. trading yesterday. Hovnanian has climbed 14 percent
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading this year. The
Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilding  Index , which
doesn’t include Hovnanian, has risen 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
