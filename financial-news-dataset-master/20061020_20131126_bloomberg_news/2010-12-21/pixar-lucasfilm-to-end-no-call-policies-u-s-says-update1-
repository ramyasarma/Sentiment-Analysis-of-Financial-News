Walt Disney Co.’s  Pixar  animation
unit and  Lucasfilm  Ltd. no longer will limit their efforts to
recruit each other’s employees, the U.S. Justice Department
said.  As part of a settlement announced today, the companies will
be prevented from entering into any agreement that could
restrain the recruitment of employees, the department said in an
e-mailed statement. According to the complaint that led to the
settlement, Lucasfilm and Pixar had agreed not to recruit each
other’s animators by abstaining from direct solicitation, or
“cold calls.”  The refusal to contact the animators deprived them of an
opportunity to make more money, the Justice Department said.
“The agreement between Lucasfilm and Pixar restrained
competition for digital animators,”  Christine Varney , who heads
the department’s antitrust division, said in the statement.  The settlement with Nicasio, California-based Lucasfilm and
Emeryville, California-based Pixar stems from a broader
department investigation into the high-tech industry’s hiring
practices.  Pixar and five other companies --  Google Inc. ,  Apple Inc. ,
 Intel Corp. ,  Adobe Systems Inc.  and  Intuit Inc.  -- had reached a
similar agreement with the department in September to not
restrain their recruiting practices.  Today’s settlement, which must be approved by the U.S.
District Court in the District of Columbia, would be effective
for five years.  In an e-mail, Lucasfilm spokeswoman  Lynne Hale  said the
company believes that “everything is covered” in the Justice
Department release and declined further comment. Zenia Mucha, a
Disney spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
