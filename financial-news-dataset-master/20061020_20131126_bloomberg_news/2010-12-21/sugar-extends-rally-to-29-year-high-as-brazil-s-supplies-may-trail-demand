Sugar futures rose in New York,
extending a rally to a 29-year high, on speculation that
supplies will start running low from Brazil, the world’s largest
producer.  Brazil’s smaller cane crop in the season ending this month
may drive prices higher in the first half of 2011, C. Czarnikow
Sugar Futures Ltd. in London said today in a report. The price
has climbed 23 percent this year, partly because of adverse
weather and shipping delays in the South American country.  “The underlying fundamentals are very tight,” said  James Kirkup , the head of sugar broking at ABN Amro Markets (U.K.)
Ltd. in London. “The strength in the market is coming from New
York, mostly from fund and speculator buying.”  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.06 cent, or 0.2
percent, to close at 33.02 cents a pound at 1:46 p.m. on ICE
Future U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached 33.65 cents,
the highest since January 1981.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery climbed
$12.20, or 1.5 percent, to $810.30 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.
Earlier, the price reached $815, the highest since at least
January 1989, when Bloomberg data begins.  The  premium  for refined sweetener over raw sugar is
narrowing “because of the threat of Indian supplies in the
first quarter of 2011,” Kirkup said. “There is a small global
surplus in whites, but a deficit in raws.”  India is the second largest producer. The country
authorized exports of 500,000 tons on Dec. 15 amid projections
that output will exceed consumption for the first time in three
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
