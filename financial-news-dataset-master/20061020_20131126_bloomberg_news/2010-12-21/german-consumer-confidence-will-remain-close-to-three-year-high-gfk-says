German consumer confidence will stay
close to the highest in more than three years as unemployment
declines in Europe’s largest economy, GfK AG said.  The Nuremberg-based market research company said today that
its  consumer sentiment index , based on a survey of about 2,000
people, will slip to 5.4 from 5.5 in December. That was the
highest since October 2007. Economists forecast a gain to 5.7,
the median of 22 estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey  showed.  German households are stepping up spending as companies
boost hiring and output to meet global orders.  Unemployment  fell
for a 17th month in November and retailers forecast further
sales gains after a “dream start” to the end-of-year holiday
season, the German Retail Federation said on Nov. 29.  “Sentiment remains stable,” GfK said in the e-mailed
statement. “Consumers believe the German economy is well on
course for recovery even if they think the unusually strong
momentum over recent months cannot be fully maintained.”  GfK’s indicator of households’ economic expectations fell
to 58.8 in December from 65.8 in November. A gauge of income
expectations declined to 40.3 from 44.9, and an index of
consumers’ willingness to spend decreased to 33.8 from 39.3.  While the pace of economic expansion slowed to 0.7 percent
in the third quarter from a record 2.3 percent in the second,
private consumption was one of the main growth contributors.
Germany’s Bundesbank said on Dec. 13 that the economy probably
showed a “further robust expansion” in the current quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
