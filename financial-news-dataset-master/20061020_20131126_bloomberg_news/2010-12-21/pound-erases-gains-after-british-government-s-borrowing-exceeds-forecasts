The pound erased its gains against
the dollar after the nation’s November budget deficit swelled to
a record, exceeding economists’ forecasts.  Sterling was little changed at $1.5515 at 9:35 a.m. in
London after rising as much as 0.4 percent earlier.  Net borrowing was 22.8 billion pounds ($35.4 billion),
compared with 16.7 billion pounds a year earlier, the Office for
National Statistics said in London today. The median of 12
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey was 16.8 billion pounds.
Spending rose the most since February. The shortfall excluding
government support for banks was 23.3 billion pounds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
