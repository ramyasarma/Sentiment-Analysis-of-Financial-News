Australia put batsman Usman Khawaja
on standby for next week’s fourth Ashes Test against England as
backup for captain  Ricky Ponting , who has a broken finger.  Khawaja, the top run scorer in Australia’s Sheffield Shield
interstate competition this season, will join the squad
tomorrow, Cricket Australia said. The match at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground starts Dec. 26.  Ponting fractured the little finger in his left hand when
he parried a catch to wicketkeeper  Brad Haddin  late on day three
of the third Test in Perth, which Australia won by 267 runs to
tie the best-of-five contest at 1-1 with two Tests to play.  “While the national selection panel are confident Ricky
Ponting will be available for the Boxing Day Test, through an
abundance of caution we have named Usman Khawaja as the standby
player,” chairman of selectors  Andrew Hilditch  said in an e-
mailed statement.  Khawaja, a Pakistan-born left-hander, has scored 598 runs
at an average of 74.75 in Australia’s elite domestic competition
this season. He was also put on standby for last month’s Ashes
opener in Brisbane because  Michael Clarke  was struggling with a
back injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
