Tiger Woods had a cortisone shot in
his right ankle to alleviate lingering soreness from a 2008
injury, his agent said.  Mark Steinberg  said in an e-mail that Woods had long
planned to have the shot after the Chevron World Challenge,
which ended Dec. 5. He isn’t expected to play again until
the Farmers Insurance Open, scheduled for Jan. 27-30 in San
Diego.  Woods, who finished the 2010 golf season without a victory,
said during the  Masters Tournament  in April that he ruptured his
Achilles’ tendon while recovering from knee surgery in 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
