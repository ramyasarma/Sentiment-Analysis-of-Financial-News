Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.’s
Australian unit, previously ruled to have misled customers with
its data-service advertisements, lost a bid in Sydney federal
court to stop  Vodafone Group Plc . from publicizing its
“ infinite ” mobile-phone plans.  Australia Federal Court Judge John Nicholas today denied
 SingTel Optus Pty Ltd. ’s request for a temporary injunction
barring Vodafone from advertising the plans, which offer
unmetered calls to fixed-line and mobile-phone numbers for A$45
($45) a month.  Optus claims Vodafone’s advertising campaign is misleading
because it doesn’t sufficiently disclose that customers can’t
make unlimited calls to satellite phones, voice mail, 1-800
numbers and directory assistance, according to court documents.  “I have serious doubts as to whether the ordinary and
reasonable consumer would understand either of the television
commercials as representing that the respondent’s plan allows a
user to make an unlimited number of calls of any type,”
Nicholas wrote in his judgment.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
previously sued SingTel Optus and won an order forcing the
company to run corrective ads and pay fines. Federal Court Judge
Nye Perram ruled in October that advertisements for Optus’s
broadband service promised data services that customers weren’t
likely to receive.  The case is SingTel Optus Ltd. v. Vodafone Hutchinson
