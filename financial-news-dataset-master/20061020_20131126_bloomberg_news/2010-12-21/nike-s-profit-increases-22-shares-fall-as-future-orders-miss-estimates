Nike Inc. , the world’s largest maker
of athletic shoes reported a 22 percent increase in second-
quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates on sales gains in
China and North America.  Net income  rose to $457 million, or 94 cents a share, in
the period ended Nov. 30, from $375.4 million, or 77 cents, a
year earlier, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company said today in
a statement. Analysts projected 88 cents, the average of 16
estimates. The results mark the 18th straight quarter Nike
surpassed projections, according to Bloomberg data.  Nike has taken advantage of the rebound in consumer
spending this year by expanding its footwear offerings as
shoppers made purchases they put off during the recession,  Chris Svezia , an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group in New York,
said in an interview before the results were released.  “Footwear is certainly a driving force for consumers
because it’s cheap and it’s an accessory item,” said Svezia,
who has a “neutral” rating on Nike shares. “Nike benefits
given its global size.”  Nike  rose $2.03 to $92.30 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have  climbed  40 percent
this year.  Future orders for December to April rose 11 percent for a
total of $7.7 billion, excluding currency fluctuations, from a
year ago. That missed the 12.4 percent gain anticipated by some
analysts.  Revenue rose 10 percent to $4.8 billion. Analysts projected
$4.82 billion, the average of 13  estimates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
