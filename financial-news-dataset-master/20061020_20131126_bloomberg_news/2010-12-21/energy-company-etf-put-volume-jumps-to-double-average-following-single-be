Trading of bearish options on U.S.
energy companies jumped to 2.6 times the four-week average,
boosted by a single bet that an  exchange-traded fund  tracking 40
companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. will
retreat by February.  Almost 56,000 puts to sell the  Energy Select Sector SPDR
Fund  changed hands as of 4 p.m. in New York, nine times the
number of calls to buy. The ETF rose to the highest since
September 2008, climbing 1 percent to $66.99.  Most of the volume was concentrated in a  single trade  in
which an investor initiating a new position bought 20,000
February $66 puts and sold 10,000 February $69 puts in a spread
strategy, options strategists at Susquehanna International Group
LLP wrote in a report. Using a spread strategy caps potential
gains while cutting the cost of the trade.  “This investor is likely positioning for substantial
weakness in shares heading into February expiration,” the Bala
Cynwyd, Pennsylvania-based strategists wrote. Those contracts
expire Feb. 18.  The ETF is up 18 percent  this year , beating the 13 percent
gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The February $66 puts had an open interest of 80 existing
contracts before today, while the February $69 puts had none.
The ETF has an  open interest  of 356,791 for calls and 631,410
for puts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
