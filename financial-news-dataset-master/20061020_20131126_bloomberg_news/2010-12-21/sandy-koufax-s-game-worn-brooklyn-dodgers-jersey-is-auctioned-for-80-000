A game-worn  Sandy Koufax  Brooklyn
Dodgers jersey, hand signed by the seven-time All-Star pitcher,
sold for $80,000 on  Lelands.com .  The jersey, one of two known to have been worn in a game by
the baseball Hall of Fame left-hander, was sold two days ago,
the auction house said in a release. Lelands, a Bohemia, New
York-based online auction house, didn’t identify the buyer.  Koufax, 74, spent his entire 11-year career with the
Dodgers in Brooklyn and Los Angeles, from 1955 through 1966. He
won the Cy Young Award twice as the best pitcher in the National
League, and was a two-time World Series Most Valuable Player.
Koufax threw four no-hitters, including a perfect game on Sept.
9, 1965.  A glove used by New York Yankees catcher  Thurman Munson  in
his 1969 rookie year sold for $54,000 as part of the same sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
