Carlos Alvarez , mayor of Miami-Dade
County, Florida’s largest municipal borrower, faces a recall
election after opponents gathered sufficient signatures to
trigger a new election, the court clerk said.  The drive to recall Alvarez came after the county raised
the property-tax rate to balance its fiscal 2011 budget. The
county commission must call an election in 45 to 90 days under
the county charter,  Harvey Ruvin ,  clerk of courts .  “Today marks the beginning of the timetable laid out by
the charter,” he said from Miami in a telephone interview
today.  Miami-Dade joins  Omaha,  Nebraska and  Chattanooga , Tennessee
in mayoral recall attempts after proposed levy increases.  The increase in the property-tax rate follows a 22 percent
slump in the county’s taxable-property values from 2007 to 2010,
according to documents provided by the property appraisers’
office. The county closed budget gaps of $1 billion in the past
four years as revenue declined, Alvarez said.  Norman Braman , a car-dealership owner ranked 269th in this
year’s  Forbes 400 list  of richest Americans, led the push to
oust the mayor. The drive collected 114,349 signatures, which
were delivered to the clerk’s office on Nov. 5. The office
certified 95,499 signatures today, almost double the 51,922
necessary to initiate a new election.  “We are analyzing the data and will continue reviewing the
legitimacy of the certification process,” Alvarez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
