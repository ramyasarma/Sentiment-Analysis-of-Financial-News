Skymark Airlines Inc. , Japan’s
largest low-cost carrier, will almost triple its fleet to 50
aircraft in four years to meet rising travel demand in the
region.  The added aircraft will all be leased, President  Shinichi Nishikubo , who owns 49 percent of the airline, said today in
Tokyo.  Skymark said it plans to expand its fleet of Boeing Co.
737s and will eventually add as many as 15 Airbus SAS A380
superjumbos as it expands into international flights, offering
discounted business-class service on a Tokyo-London route. The
carrier operates a fleet of 17 737-800s, according to London-
based Ascend, which collects aviation data.  Nishikubo, who spoke at a Foreign Correspondents Club of
Japan luncheon in Tokyo, said the company had no plan to sell
shares to finance the expansion. His initial remarks didn’t
cover whether any of the Boeing 737 aircraft to be added were on
order or how much the airline expected to pay to lease them.  Skymark signed a memorandum of understanding with  Airbus 
last month covering the purchase of four A380s, with options for
two more as part of the plan to eventually add as many as 15.
The order for the first four planes is worth 1.39 billion euros
($1.8 billion), according to Airbus’s list prices.  Nishikubo also said the airline has 8 billion yen
($96 million) worth of dollars in cash and that the company
intends to continue buying the U.S. currency.  Skymark, which is listed on the start-up Mothers section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange,  rose  3.3 percent to 1,140 yen at 1:36
p.m. in Tokyo trading. The shares have almost tripled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
