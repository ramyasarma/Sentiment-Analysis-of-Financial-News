Alitalia SpA said in a statement
that it will operate only six flights to London today because of
extreme winter weather.  The carrier will run two flights to Heathrow Airport from
Milan’s Linate and four from Rome’s Fiumicino, according to the
statement. Florence’s airport is closed due to fog, the company
said, and other domestic flights are operating normally.
Intercontinental traffic is unaffected, Alitalia said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
