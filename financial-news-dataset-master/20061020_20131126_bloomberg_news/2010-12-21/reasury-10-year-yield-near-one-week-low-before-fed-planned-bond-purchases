     Dec. 21 (Bloomberg) --  Treasuries  advanced, pushing the
yield on the benchmark 10-year note toward a one-week low, after
the Federal Reserve purchased $9.4 billion of notes and
inflation-indexed debt.  Yields  have increased about 1 percentage point from their
2010 low on speculation the U.S. extension of tax cuts will spur
economic growth and widen the budget deficit. Yields rose
earlier today as a gain in stocks reduced demand for the safety
of government debt.  “The good news is that the market hasn’t fallen apart
today, but the bad news is that with the Fed purchases the
market should arguably be higher,” said  Theodore Ake , head of
Treasury trading at Societe Generale SA in New York. “Activity
levels are very light, so flows are exaggerated. That condition
should hold into next week.”  The 10-year note yield decreased four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.31 percent at 5:06 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 advanced 10/32, or
$3.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 94 9/32.  The 10-year note yield fell to 3.25 percent yesterday, the
lowest level since Dec. 10. The yield slid to the 2010 low of
2.33 percent on Oct. 8. The yield rose on Dec. 16 to 3.56
percent, the highest level since May 13.  ‘More Neutral’  “The market is more neutral near these levels given the
strength of the recent sell-off,” said  Joseph Leary , an
interest-rate strategist in New York at Citigroup Inc., one of
the 18 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed. “Fair
value for 10-years is closer to 3 percent, but we would be
reluctant to go long on the long end with so much illiquidity in
the market until the new year.” A long is a bet that an asset
will gain in value.  The 10-year note yield will slide to 3.05 percent by March
31, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
of 67 strategists and economists, with the most recent forecasts
given the heaviest weightings.  More than 65 percent of respondents in a Citigroup survey
of money managers, insurance companies and other financial
services groups expect 10-year note yields to rise by the end of
the first quarter of next year,  Neela Gollapudi , an interest-
rate strategist in New York at Citigroup, said in a telephone
interview. Gollapudi said 53 percent expect the yield will
increase to a level higher than 3.50 percent. He declined to say
how many participated in the survey.  Fed Debt Buying  The central bank bought $7.790 billion of notes today
maturing from June 2016 to November 2017 and $1.619 billion of
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities due from July 2012 to
February 2040.  Traders are adding to bets that inflation will pick up. The
 difference  between yields on 10-year notes and TIPS, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
securities known as the break-even rate, has advanced to 2.31
percentage points, up from this year’s low of 1.47 in August.
The five-year average is 2.09 percentage points.  The central bank purchased debt yesterday maturing from
2018 to 2020 and from 2014 to 2016, taking up $14.6 billion in
securities, the biggest  amount  in a single day under the second
round of quantitative easing.  Bond yields dropped earlier today as Moody’s Investors
Service said it put Portugal’s A1 long-term and Prime-1 short-
term government bond ratings on watch. It lowered Ireland’s rank
by five levels on Dec. 17 and said two days earlier that it may
reduce Spain’s rating, citing “substantial funding
requirements.”  Fitch on Greece  Fitch Ratings said today it may cut Greece’s credit rating
to below investment grade within six weeks after a review of the
nation’s “fiscal sustainability.”  The Fed authorized the extension through Aug. 1 of its
temporary dollar liquidity swap arrangements with the European
Central Bank and the central banks of Japan, Canada, Switzerland
and the United Kingdom.  The arrangements had been authorized through January, the
Fed said today in a statement. Fed officials voted in May to
restart the emergency currency-swap tool to keep Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis from spreading to U.S. markets.  Yields  rose earlier as stocks extended their advance. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.6 percent, completing
its recovery from the plunge after Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.’s collapse in 2008.  Treasuries have handed investors a loss of 2.1 percent this
month, paring this year’s returns to 5.6 percent, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Debt issued by euro-area
governments has gained 1.2 percent in 2010, with Irish and
Portuguese debt losing 13 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
