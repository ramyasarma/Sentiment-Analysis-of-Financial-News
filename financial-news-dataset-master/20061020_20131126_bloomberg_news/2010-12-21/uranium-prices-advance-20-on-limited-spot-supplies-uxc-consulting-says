Uranium prices have risen about 20
percent since October because of a limited supply of the nuclear
fuel being available to utilities, producers and traders on the
spot market, according to data provided by Ux Consulting Co.  Uranium-oxide concentrate for immediate delivery reached
$62.50 a pound in the week through to yesterday, the Roswell,
Georgia-based UxC said in a report. That compares with $52 a
pound in the week through Oct. 25.  “As spot material has remained fairly limited, spot offers
have continued to climb over the past two months,” UxC said in
the report. “Price increases did slow somewhat as the spot
price broke the $60 mark and higher than expected sales were
made toward the end of the year.”  Trading is thin as the market enters the holiday season,
UxC said. Some market participants are expecting spot demand to
increase during January, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
