Crude oil surged to a two-year high
as U.S. same-store sales jumped the most since April and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index recovered from its 2008 plunge.  Futures increased 0.5 percent after a private report showed
same-store sales climbed 4.2 percent last week. The S&P 500
rebounded to a level not seen since the day before Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. filed the world’s biggest bankruptcy in
September 2008.  “Holiday shopping appears to be strong, which is
increasing optimism about the economy in the coming year,” said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester, Massachusetts. “Prices are moving higher on
probably premature anticipation of tightness.”  Crude oil for February delivery gained 45 cents to $89.82 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since Oct. 7, 2008. Prices have climbed 13 percent
this year.  Brent crude oil for February settlement rose 46 cents, or
0.5 percent, to end the session at $93.20 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest
settlement since Oct. 1, 2008.  Prices increased from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
supplies declined 5.8 million barrels to 342 million last week.
February oil was up 62 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $89.99 a barrel
in electronic trading at 4:34 p.m.  Holiday Sales  Same-store sales at a selection of U.S. retailers posted
their biggest holiday jump according to a chain-store sales
index released today by the New York-based International Council
of Shopping Centers and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc .  Holiday retail sales are a key economic indicator in the
U.S., the world’s largest oil-consuming country.  The  S&P 500 Index  gained 0.6 percent to 1,254.60, topping
its closing level of 1,251.70 on Sept. 12, 2008, the last
trading session before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy filing.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 0.5 percent to
11,533.16.  “Equities are up, which is supportive,” said  Tom Bentz , a
broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York.
“The market continues to rise on positive economic sentiment.”  U.S. GDP grew 2.8 percent in the third quarter, up from an
estimate of 2.5 percent last month, based on the median forecast
of 69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg before a Commerce
Department report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  Chinese Demand  China, the world’s second-largest oil-consuming country,
said net oil-product imports almost doubled last month to 1.44
million tons, customs data showed in Beijing today.  China will raise the price of gasoline by 310 yuan ($47) a
metric ton and diesel by 300 yuan a ton starting tomorrow,
according to two officials who had been notified of the increase
and declined to be identified as they aren’t authorized to speak
to the media.  Inflation in China accelerated to the fastest pace in 28
months in November, fueling speculation that the government will
raise interest rates next year. Higher borrowing costs may
reduce the country’s influence over global commodity markets,
according to Goldman Sachs.  “There has been an insatiable appetite from hedge funds
and other investors as oil demand picks up,” said  Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Bache Commodities Ltd. in London. “But
if higher internal fuel prices and monetary tightening slow
Chinese growth, and Northern Hemisphere temperatures warm up,
the oil market could come off the boil.”  U.S. Stockpiles  U.S.  crude inventories  probably fell last week as refiners
on the Gulf Coast reduced their assets for tax savings at the
end of the year, the Bloomberg survey showed.  Stockpiles dropped 3.4 million barrels in the seven days
ended Dec. 17 from 346 million, based on the median  estimate  of
14 analysts before an Energy Department report tomorrow.
Supplies in the previous week slumped 9.85 million, the most
since May 2008, as imports fell.  “We’re all looking at the economic recovery and tightening
supply,” said  Carl Larry , president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions
LLC in Houston. “This isn’t like 2008 and 2009 when there was a
huge overhang in supply. This is a cold winter, the global
economy is recovering and demand is picking up.”  Gasoline inventories may have increased by 1.5 million
barrels from 214.8 million, the survey showed. Analysts were
split over whether stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category
that includes heating oil and diesel, declined or gained.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 322,469 contracts as of 4:35
p.m. in electronic trading New York. Volume totaled 554,032
contracts yesterday, 18 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.36 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
