European stocks advanced and U.S.
stock-index futures and Asian shares rallied as tensions on the
Korean Peninsula eased and China said it took “concrete
action” to help Europe limit its sovereign-debt crisis.  Mining companies climbed with commodity prices after North
Korea failed to retaliate against military drills by South Korea
yesterday. Royal DSM NV rose 1.1 percent after agreeing to buy
U.S.-based Martek Biosciences Corp. for $1.09 billion. Bilfinger
Berger SE gained 1.1 percent after Lend Lease Group agreed to
buy its Australian unit.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.4 percent to
279.5 at 8:03 a.m. in London, extending its highest level since
2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
