Townsends Inc. , a vertically
integrated chicken producer, filed under Chapter 11 on Dec. 19
to obtain additional credit that the secured lenders would only
advance with protection from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Wilmington,  Delaware .  Family-owned Townsends, based in Georgetown, Delaware, has
a capacity of producing 700 million pounds of poultry a year.
Egg production is 1.3 million a week, while the company can
generate 950,000 tons of feed annually, court papers say.  Assets are $131 million. Debt totals $127 million,
according to a court filing. Annual revenue in the most-recent
12 months was $504 million. Townsends contracts with more than
300 growers who operate 1,200 chicken houses. Townsends retains
ownership of the chickens and the feed supplied to growers.  Townsends is a smaller version of chicken producer  Pilgrim’s Pride Corp ., which emerged from bankruptcy
reorganization in December 2009 paying creditors in full.
Brazil’s JBS SA acquired 64 percent of Pilgrim’s Pride for $800
million. Existing owners retained 34 percent of the equity.  Townsends owes its secured lenders $20.7 million on a term
loan and $40 million on a revolving credit. For the Chapter 11
case, the lenders are willing to provide a new $12 million loan
and a $40 million replacement revolving credit.  Townsends also owes $8.3 million on secured 8.44 percent
notes that share some collateral with the secured lenders. A
court filing says trade debt is $21.7 million. There is $9.9
million of underfunding on a defined-benefit pension plan.  Townsends traces its financial problems to 2008 when feed
prices rose while chicken prices fell. The result was a $48.9
million loss in 2008.  The four production facilities are in  Arkansas  and  North
Carolina .  The case is In re Townsends Inc., 10-14092, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  Updates  Lehman Settles Auction-Rate Claim for $975,000    Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc . for a seventh time is seeking
an increase in the amount insurance companies may pay to resolve
claims under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. The
latest motion will allow payment of $975,000 to settle a $304
million securities-law claim related to auction-rate securities.    Northgate Minerals Corp . filed the $304 million claim
against Lehman and also initiated an arbitration against Lehman
executives under the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The resulting settlement will oblige the providers of directors’
and officers’ insurance to pay $975,000. In the process, Lehman
will receive a release.  For the policy year May 2007 to May 2008, Lehman had $250
million in so-called D&O insurance. Claims have already eaten
through the first three layers. To enable the settlement, Lehman
will hold a hearing on Jan. 13 where the bankruptcy judge will
be asked to allow payments from the fourth and fifth layers of
insurance covering liabilities between $55 million and $85
million for the policy year.  Lehman reported that cash increased about $300 million
during November, to end at approximately $21.4 billion. Cash
receipts in the month were almost $1.8 billion, the operating
report for November said.  Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. leads the Lehman
companies with $8,331 billion cash. In second place is Lehman
Commercial Paper Inc. with $4.375 billion, followed by the
holding company with $1.999 billion.  Professional fees and expenses since the case began more
than two years ago now total $1.1 billion, including $45.07
million in November professional costs plus fees for the U.S.
Trustee system.  Alvarez & Marsal LLC, the financial advisers, billed $12.6
million in November, bringing the total since September 2008 to
$382.44 million. The fees for Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP, chief
bankruptcy counsel, now total $254.58 million, including $8.74
million in November. Attorneys for the official creditors’
committee from Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy LLP have been paid
$83.53 million, including $7.88 million in September.  New York’s outgoing Attorney General Andrew Cuomo will sue
Lehman’s auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, according to a person
familiar with the matter. The suit will allege violations of New
York’s securities fraud statute, the Martin Act, said the
person. Cuomo will become  New York ’s governor on Jan. 1. For

York on Sept. 15, 2008, and sold office buildings and the North
American investment banking business to London-based  Barclays
Plc  one week later. The Lehman brokerage operations went into
liquidation on Sept. 19, 2008, in the same court. The brokerage
is in the control of a trustee appointed under the Securities
Investor Protection Act.  The Lehman holding company Chapter 11 case is In re Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555, while the liquidation
proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act for the
brokerage operation is Securities Investors Protection Corp. v.
Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420, both in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District New York   Manhattan ).  Walrath Can’t Decide WaMu Confirmation by Dec. 31  The judge presiding over the reorganization of  Washington 
Mutual Inc. said she won’t be able to decide by Dec. 31 whether
she will or won’t approve the global settlement and confirm the
Chapter 11 plan.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath held a four-day
confirmation trial that ended Dec. 7. The global settlement, the
cornerstone of the Chapter 11 plan, has a Dec. 31 deadline for
approval by Walrath.  The judge signed an order yesterday directing the parties
to confer and “advise the court” whether they agree to an
extension of the Dec. 31 deadline. Walrath said she “will not
be able to issue an opinion on the confirmation of the plan
until after Dec. 31.”  If Walrath approves the plan, it will distribute more than
$7 billion to creditors. For a summary of changes WaMu made to
its plan in October, click here for the Oct. 7 Bloomberg
bankruptcy report. To read about the settlement before it was
modified, click here for the May 24 Bloomberg bankruptcy report.
Click here to read the May 18 Bloomberg bankruptcy report for a
summary of WaMu’s plan.  The WaMu holding company filed under Chapter 11 in
September 2008, one day after the bank subsidiary was taken
over. The bank, once the sixth-largest depository and credit-
card issuer in the U.S., was the largest bank failure in the
country’s history. The holding company filed formal lists of
assets and debt showing property with a total value of $4.49
billion against liabilities of $7.83 billion.  The holding company Chapter 11 case is In re  Washington
Mutual Inc ., 08-12229, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington).  Blockbuster to Close 182 Stores by End of First Quarter 2011  Blockbuster Inc., the movie rental chain, will have closed
about 182 stores between the time it filed under Chapter 11 on
Sept. 23 and the end of the first quarter of 2011, the movie
rental chain said in a Dec. 17 bankruptcy court filing.  Blockbuster intends to continue its practice of liquidating
or transferring store fixtures and inventory on its own.  Blockbuster arranged a Jan. 11 hearing to approve the
additional store closings and be sure no landlord can stop
liquidation sales under local laws.  Since the bankruptcy filing, Blockbuster rejected
approximately 220 leases, the company told the judge. Most of
the locations were closed before bankruptcy.  Blockbuster said it is closing 72 stores by the end of the
year and about 110 more in the three months of next year.  Anticipating the Chapter 11 filing, Blockbuster negotiated
a plan with holders of 80 percent of the $630 million in 11.75
percent senior-secured notes. The plan would give them the new
stock. General unsecured creditors would have warrants for 3
percent of the stock. Holders of the $300 million in 9 percent
subordinated notes would receive nothing. After two extensions,
the deadline for filing the plan is now Jan. 14.  Dallas-based Blockbuster began reorganization with 5,600
stores, including 3,300 in the U.S., with the remainder abroad.
Among the U.S. stores, 3,000 were owned and while the rest are
franchised.  The petition listed assets of $1.1 billion against debt of
$1.5 billion. Blockbuster estimated it owes $57 million in
accounts payable in addition to the secured and subordinated
notes.  The case is In re  Blockbuster Inc ., 10-14997, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  Vitro’s New York Chapter 15 May Proceed Temporarily  Vitro SAB, Mexico’s largest glassmaker, can proceed with
its Chapter 15 petition in New York, at least until Jan. 6 when
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Russell F. Nelms in Fort Worth, Texas,
will decide if the case in Manhattan should be transferred to
Texas.  Vitro and subsidiaries are the subject of lawsuits and
bankruptcies in three courts in the U.S., not including the
bankruptcy reorganization begun this month in Mexico. Creditors
filed involuntary Chapter 11 petitions in November in Fort Worth
against U.S. Vitro subsidiaries. The parent Vitro filed the
Chapter 15 petition in New York this month immediately after
commencing court reorganization in Mexico.  U.S. bankruptcy law allows the judge with the first-filed
case to decide whether to hear later-filed cases, too. Thus,
Nelms will hold a Jan. 6 hearing on a motion by noteholders to
transfer the New York Chapter 15 case to Texas.  At a hearing yesterday, Nelms modified an automatic stay
that halted proceedings in the Chapter 15 case until the venue
issue is decided. Vitro therefore will be able to ask the
bankruptcy judge in New York for several forms of preliminary
relief in the Chapter 15 case, such as calling a halt to state
court lawsuits where Vitro is being sued by noteholders to
recover on debt that’s been in default for some two years.  Yesterday, Nelms said he would hold a separate hearing on
Feb. 10 to decide if the U.S. Vitro subsidiaries should be
thrown into Chapter 11 involuntarily.  For a summary of Vitro’s proposed reorganization and a
survey of the multiplicity of suits between Vitro and the
noteholders, click here for the Dec. 15 Bloomberg bankruptcy
report.  Vitro has been in default on $1.2 billion in bonds for
about two years. Bondholders are opposing the reorganization,
contending it shouldn’t be approved because it depends on voting
$1.9 billion of intercompany claims in favor of the plan. Vitro
previously said noteholders would recover as much as 73 percent
by exchanging existing debt for cash, new debt and convertible
bonds.  The first-filed involuntary case is In re Vitro Asset
Corp., 10-47470, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of
Texas (Fort Worth). The Chapter 15 case is In re Vitro SAB,
10-16619, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  Lipstick Building Files Income and Expense Projection  The owner of the so-called Lipstick Building on Third
Avenue in Manhattan prepared for tomorrow’s confirmation hearing
by filing a cash-flow forecast showing how the Chapter 11
reorganization plan is feasible.  The projections show rental income rising from $33.75
million in 2011 to $43.95 million in 2017. Operating income of
$22.01 million in 2011 is projected to rise to $30.3 million in
2017.  Cash flow after debt service is estimated to be $5.55
million in 2011, increasing to $5.89 million in 2017.  The building’s owner filed a prepackaged Chapter 11
petition Nov. 16 in New York designed for reducing the $210
million mortgage to $115 million. The plan was accepted by the
only two classes of affected creditors before the Chapter 11
filing. For details on the plan, click here for the Nov. 17
Bloomberg bankruptcy report.  Built in 1986, the 34-story property is on the East Side of
Manhattan, between 53rd and 54th streets. The nickname resulted
from the building’s dark pink color and elliptical shape.  The case is In re Metropolitan 885 Third Avenue Leasehold
LLC, 10-16103, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  Disclosure Approved, Advanta Sets Confirmation Hearing    Advanta Corp ., a holding company for a failed bank, will
conduct a confirmation hearing on Feb. 10 where U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Kevin J. Carey will be asked to approve the Chapter 11
plan. Carey authorized sending the explanatory disclosure
statement to creditors on Dec. 17.  The creditors’ committee, once opposed, is now urging
creditors to vote “yes.”  Under Advanta’s plan, holders of $140.6 million in
unsecured notes could be paid in full. General unsecured
creditors, with as much as $180.6 million in claims, could
recover up to 71.3 percent.  The disclosure statement says the company has $105.8
million cash. Assets for distribution eventually are projected
to $157.8 million to $179.8 million. For more details on the
plan, click here for the Nov. 15 Bloomberg bankruptcy report.  Advanta’s bank subsidiary stopped issuing new credit cards
and allowing new charges on existing cards in May 2009. It was
taken over by regulators in March 2010. The holding company
filed under Chapter 11 in November 2009.  The holding company’s petition listed assets of $363
million against debt totaling $331 million in September 2009.
Originally, Advanta listed debt as including $138 million in
senior retail investment notes and $89 million in subordinated
notes. Debt owing to trade creditors was listed as $5 million.  The case is In re Advanta Corp., 09-13931, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  Champion Home May Compete to Buy Palm Harbor Homes  Champion Home Builders Co. may compete at the auction for  Palm Harbor Homes Inc ., a court filing by two creditors of Palm
Harbor said. There will be a hearing tomorrow to set up auction
and sale procedures for Palm Harbor, a maker of factory-built
homes that filed under Chapter 11 on Nov. 29.  Funds affiliated with Centerbridge Capital Partners LLC and
Sankaty Advisors Inc. said in a bankruptcy court filing
yesterday that Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Champion signed a
confidentiality agreement and is examining financial information
about Palm Harbor. The two funds together hold almost $16
million in 3.25 percent convertible senior notes issued by Palm
Harbor. They also together control Champion, their court filing
says.  The two funds are asking the bankruptcy court to allow
buyers an additional month to conduct due diligence. They
believe that holding an auction Jan. 25 does not allow enough
time for competing bidders.  Tomorrow is also the final hearing to approve $50 million
in financing provided by the prospective buyer Fleetwood
Enterprises Inc.  Fleetwood is a venture between  Cavco Industries Inc . and a
fund advised by Third Avenue Management LLC. Fleetwood was
purchased out of Chapter 11 this year for $26 million by Cavco,
a producer of manufactured homes from Phoenix.  Palm Harbor’s petition said assets are $321 million with
debt totaling $280 million. In addition to $34 million owing to
Textron Financial Corp., there was $53.8 million owing on 3.25
percent convertible senior notes due 2024.  Palm Harbor is based in Dallas.  The case is In re  Palm Harbor Homes Inc ., 10-13850, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  MGM Consummates Prepackaged Chapter 11 Reorg Plan  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. filed a prepackaged Chapter 11
petition on Nov. 3, won the signature of the bankruptcy judge on
a Dec. 6 confirmation order, and implemented the plan yesterday,
swapping $5 billion of secured debt for most of the new equity.
There were no objections to confirmation of the plan. Creditors
voted before the Chapter 11 petition was filed. The plan pays
general unsecured claims in full while existing stockholders
receive nothing.  MGM’s assets included 4,100 feature films and 10,800
television episodes. The assets at Sept. 30 were $2.67 billion
with total liabilities listed for $5.77 billion, without
adjustments under generally accepted accounting principles. MGM
owns 62.5 percent of United Artists Entertainment LLC, which
isn’t in bankruptcy.  Los Angeles-based MGM was acquired in April 2005 in a $4.8
billion transaction by a group including  Credit Suisse Group AG ,
Providence Equity Partners Inc.,  Sony Corp . and TPG Capital.  The case is In re Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.,
10-15774, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  American Media Confirms Prepack Inside Five Weeks  American Media Inc., the publisher of supermarket tabloids
Star and National Enquirer, prevailed on the bankruptcy judge at
a confirmation hearing yesterday to approve the prepackaged
reorganization plan less than five weeks after the Chapter 11
filing on Nov. 17.  American Media told the judge the company hopes to
implement the plan as soon as tomorrow. There were no objections
to confirmation. For Bloomberg coverage of the confirmation
hearing, click here.  The plan was accepted before the Chapter 11 filing by every
class of affected creditors except holders of $7.5 million in
notes due 2011. The plan gives full payment to revolving credit
lenders while the term-loan lenders receive 70 percent in cash
with the remainder in second-lien notes, also for full payment.  Holders of the subordinated notes are to receive 98 percent
of the new stock for an estimated 53.5 percent recovery. Holders
of the 2011 notes are being given the remaining 2 percent of the
new equity for the same 53.5 percent recovery. For details on
the plan, click here for the Nov. 18 Bloomberg bankruptcy
report.  Boca Raton, Florida-based American Media listed assets of
$668 million against debt totaling $1.23 billion. Borrowed money
is almost $880 million. Liabilities include $491 million on a
first-lien obligation, including a $60 million revolving credit
and a $431 million term loan. There are $356 million in
subordinated notes.  The case is American Media Inc., 10-16140, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  Vertis Consummates Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan  Vertis Inc., an advertising and marketing services
provider, filed a prepackaged reorganization on Nov. 17,
confirmed the plan on Dec. 16, and consummated the plan
yesterday. Negotiated before the Chapter 11 filing, the plan
reduces debt by $700 million, or about 60 percent. The plan was
almost unanimously accepted by two classes of affected
noteholders. For details on the plan, click here for the Nov. 18
Bloomberg bankruptcy report.  The new filing came slightly more than two years after
Vertis and American Color Graphics Inc. merged by confirming
companion Chapter 11 reorganizations. The prior reorganizations
reduced combined debt by almost $1 billion. ACG was the third-
largest insert printer in North American.  Brentwood, Tennessee-based ACG had $528 million in debt
before the prior bankruptcy while the debt of Baltimore-based
Vertis was $1.7 billion at the holding company. Vertis was the
survivor in the merger.  The new case is In re Vertis Holdings Inc., 10-16170, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
prior cases were In re ACG Holdings Inc., 08-11467, and In re
Vertis Holdings Inc., 08-11460, both in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  AmericanWest to File Plan by February; Bank Sold  AmericanWest Bancorporation, a bank holding company that
filed under Chapter 11 on Oct. 28, announced yesterday that it
completed the court-approved sale of the bank subsidiary to
SKBHC Holdings Inc. for $6.5 million cash.  The holding company said it expects to file a Chapter 11
plan by the end of February. The assets currently consist of $6
million cash. Claims are $46 million the statement said.  The bank has 58 branches with 77,000 customers in eastern

confirmed the Chapter 11 reorganization when the bankruptcy
judge signed a plan-approval order on Dec. 17. The plan resulted
from a settlement with the unsecured creditors’ committee.  In exchange for not suing MatlinPatterson Global Advisors,
both a secured lender and the controlling shareholder, the pot
for unsecured creditors was increased by $800,000 cash plus part
of recoveries from collections of accounts receivable.  According to the disclosure statement, the settlement is
estimated to result in a recovery ranging between 10.7 percent
and 24.8 percent for unsecured creditors whose claims are
estimated to range between $30 million and $41 million. The
midpoint estimated recovery was 18.3 percent.  To settle, MatlinPatterson gave up $2.4 million of its cash
collateral. As lender, it won’t receive any distribution on a
$34.7 million deficiency claim.  The shell of the company and operating certificate are
being sold for $800,000 cash. The operating certificate allows
conducting the business as an airline.  Also known as Arrow Cargo, the company at one time operated
60 flights a week with four leased DC-10-30 and three leased
B757-200 aircraft. It was acquired in June 2008 by a fund
affiliated with MatlinPatterson. When the Chapter 11 petition
was filed, the funds were owed $72 million on secured and
unsecured term loans.  The case is In re Arrow Air Inc., 10-28831, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District Florida (Miami).  Blue Wolf Buys Gloucester in Confirmed Chapter 11 Plan  Gloucester Engineering Co. , a producer and servicer of
plastic film-extrusion equipment, secured approval of a Chapter
11 plan where the secured lender Blue Wolf Capital Fund II LP
assumes ownership in exchange for debt. The company said in a
statement that it intends to implement the plan on Dec. 31.  The bankruptcy judge in Boston approved the plan at a
confirmation hearing yesterday, court papers say. There were no
objections to the plan.  The disclosure statement said that unsecured creditors,
owed $13.6 million, should see a recovery between 3.8 percent
and 7.8 percent by splitting $500,000 cash and other
consideration.  Blue Wolf is converting $6 million of financing for the
Chapter 11 case into a new exit loan. Blue Wolf’s secured claim,
totaling almost $13.5 million, exchanges for the new equity.  Gloucester converted an involuntary Chapter 7 petition into
a Chapter 11 reorganization in June.  Based in the Massachusetts town of the same name,
Gloucester had $41 million revenue in 2009. The company was
acquired in October 2007 in a management buyout.  The case is In re Gloucester Engineering Co. Inc.,
10-12967, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston).  Watch List  Thomas the Tank Engine Owner Downgraded on Maturities  Hit Entertainment Ltd., known by children for properties
such Thomas the Tank Engine, has a Caa1 corporate rating after
yesterday’s one-level downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service.  Moody’s said that “asset sales and/or a sale of the
company may be required” in the face of “the mid-2012 maturity
of a significant proportion of its credit facilities.”  Moody’s says Hit has been in an “ongoing struggle to
generate positive free cash flow.”  The second-lien debt was demoted to Caa3.  Operating from  London  and New York, Hit exploits its
properties through television, video, publishing, licensing and
live events.  Hit is controlled by Apax Partners LLP, according to
Bloomberg data.  Downgrade  General Maritime Downgraded, Stock at All-Time Low    General Maritime Corp ., an operator of 37 crude oil and
petroleum product tankers, was downgraded by two levels
yesterday to a B3 corporate rating by Moody’s Investors Service
in view of $190 million in upcoming commitments for debt
maturities and a vessel-purchase agreement.  Moody’s projects that the commitments “will likely need to
be funded” from proceeds of vessel sales or issuance of new
equity, given that the “financial profile cannot accommodate
additional debt.”  Moody’s notes that five vessels could be sold.  Although General Maritime had $59 million cash on the books
at the end of September, liquidity covenants only allow use of
the excess above $50 million, Moody’s said.  In a downgrade earlier this month, Standard & Poor’s said
there is a “high probability of a covenant breach over the next
quarter.” The S&P corporate grade is one click lower than
Moody’s at CCC+.  For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the New York-based company
reported a $22 million net loss on revenue of $98.3 million.  The stock fell 14 cents yesterday to $3.04 in New York
Stock Exchange trading, its lowest closing price ever. The
three-year high was $22.87 on May 21, 2008.  Daily Podcast  Maturing Junk Debt, Dreier Fraud, Vertis CEO: Bankruptcy Audio  The dearth of maturing junk debt in 2011 and the mountain
