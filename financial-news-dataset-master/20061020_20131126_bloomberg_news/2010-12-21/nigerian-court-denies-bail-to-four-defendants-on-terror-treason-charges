A Nigerian judge denied bail to
Charles Okah, the brother of alleged rebel leader  Henry Okah ,
and three others who face charges of terrorism and treason over
twin car bombings on Oct. 1 that killed 12 people.  Judge Gabriel Kolawole ruled that there were no guarantees
that the suspects, if granted bail, would show up for their
trial, which he set for Jan. 12 to Jan. 18, court proceedings
show. Okah will appeal the decision, his lawyer, Oghenovo Otemu,
said in an interview.  The four defendants were charged at the Federal High Court
on Dec. 8 for the blasts near a venue in the capital, Abuja,
where President Goodluck Jonathan was attending a celebration of
Nigeria’s 50 years of independence. The Movement for the
Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, the main armed group
fighting in the southern oil region, claimed responsibility for
the explosions.  Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer. Attacks by MEND
cut more than 28 percent of the West African country’s crude
output between 2006 and 2009, according to Bloomberg data. While
the attacks decreased after thousands of fighters accepted a
government amnesty last year, MEND refused to disarm, saying its
demands were not met.  To contact the reporter on this story:
