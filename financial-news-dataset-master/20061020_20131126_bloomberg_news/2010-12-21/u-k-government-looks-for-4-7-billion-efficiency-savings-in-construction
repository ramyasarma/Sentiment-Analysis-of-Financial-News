The U.K. government said it could
cut 3 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) a year of the country’s
infrastructure bill by lowering specifications and speeding up
the way contracts are awarded.  The report for a subsidiary of the Treasury was aimed at
finding ways of getting more for less from spending on large
projects, as the government tries to cut costs without hurting
the country’s economic capacity.  The Treasury said efficiency savings on energy, transport
and flood-defense projects could cut 15 percent from the cost,
reducing bills for customers, citing the 2012 Olympic Games in
London as an example. It said U.K. spending on such projects is
between 15 and 20 billion pounds a year.  “One look at projects like the Olympics, where over 600
million pounds has been saved, shows that the U.K. can deliver
big infrastructure projects on time and within budget,” Chief
Secretary to the Treasury  Danny Alexander  said in an e-mailed
statement today. “Savings are in everyone’s interests, as it
will see the taxpayer get more value for money and will make the
U.K. a cheaper place to do business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
