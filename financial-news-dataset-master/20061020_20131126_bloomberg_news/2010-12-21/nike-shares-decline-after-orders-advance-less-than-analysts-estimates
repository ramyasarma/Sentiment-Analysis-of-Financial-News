Nike Inc. , the world’s largest maker
of athletic shoes, declined as much as 5.9 percent in extended
trading after reporting orders that fell short of some analysts’
estimates.  Nike  fell as much as $5.40 to $86.90 in extended trading
after closing today at $92.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares have  climbed  40 percent this year.  Orders for December to April rose 11 percent for a total of
$7.7 billion, excluding currency fluctuations, from a year ago.
That missed the 11.6 percent gain projected by an average of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Japanese orders fell 5 percent, the worst performer among
Nike’s markets. Nike, led by Chief Executive Officer Mark
Parker, got less than 5 percent of its revenue from that country
last quarter, compared with more than 25 percent for North
America, its biggest market.  Net income  rose 22 percent to $457 million, or 94 cents a
share, in the period ended Nov. 30, from $375.4 million, or 77
cents, a year earlier, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts projected 88 cents, the average
of 16 estimates.  Revenue rose 10 percent to $4.8 billion. Analysts projected
$4.82 billion, the average of 13  estimates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
