LeBron James  was held to 19 points
and the Miami Heat had their 12-game winning streak snapped by
the Dallas Mavericks, who got 26 points from  Dirk Nowitzki  in a
98-96 win.  James, who entered the game ranked fifth in the National
Basketball Association with an average of 24.5 points per game,
missed 11 of his 17 shots last night as the Heat lost their 14th
straight regular-season game against Dallas.  James was limited to 12 minutes in the first half because
of fouls and Dallas’s zone defense kept him in check offensively
at American Airlines Arena in Miami.  Jason Terry  came off the bench to score all 19 of his
points in the fourth quarter for Dallas, including a 3-pointer
with 1:24 left.  To contact the reporter on this story:
