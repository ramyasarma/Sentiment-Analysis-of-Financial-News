Bank of America Corp.  said that  Mark Hogan , in charge of East Coast branches of the biggest U.S.
bank, is departing after  Katy Knox  was promoted to supervise all
locations.  Hogan “is leaving the company,” said  Anne Pace , a
spokeswoman for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company.
Knox, who joined Bank of America through its 2004 purchase of
FleetBoston Financial Inc., will be in charge of banking centers
and claims and fraud divisions.  Bank of America Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan 
has installed other former FleetBoston colleagues in top posts.
 Terry Laughlin  was made a senior executive in the bank’s money-
losing mortgage unit.  Mike Lyons  joined as a strategy and
planning executive to help shrink the bank’s balance sheet.
Moynihan also promoted  Lauren Mogensen  to deputy general counsel
and corporate secretary.  Knox will report to consumer banking head  Joseph Price ,
according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported Hogan’s
resignation today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
