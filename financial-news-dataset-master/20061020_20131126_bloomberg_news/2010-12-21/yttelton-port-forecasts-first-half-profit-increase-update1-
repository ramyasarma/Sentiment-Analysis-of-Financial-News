Lyttelton Port Co. Ltd. , the largest
container terminal on New Zealand’s South Island, expects first-
half profit to increase at least 50 percent even after costs
related to Christchurch’s Sept. 4 earthquake.  Lyttelton Port forecasts net income from trading for the
six months ending Dec. 31 to be between NZ$5.5 million ($4.1
million) and NZ$6.2 million after a “strong start” to the
first half, the Christchurch-based company said in a statement.
It reported profit of NZ$3.7 million in the year-earlier period.  The timing of earthquake insurance proceeds and related
spending is “extremely difficult to forecast at this time,”
Chairman  Rodger Fisher  said in the statement. The forecast
doesn’t include impairments to the company’s assets, he said,  The port suffered damage to its wharves, cranes and other
facilities when a magnitude 7 earthquake struck the region. The
damage, mainly to paving and flat surfaces, would take months to
fix and repairs could cost “millions” of dollars, Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Davie  said in a Sept. 4 interview.  Net income from trading was NZ$5 million in the five months
ended Nov 30, the company said today. Lyttelton Port  shares  were
untraded as at 12:40 p.m. in Wellington.  To contact the reporter for this story:
