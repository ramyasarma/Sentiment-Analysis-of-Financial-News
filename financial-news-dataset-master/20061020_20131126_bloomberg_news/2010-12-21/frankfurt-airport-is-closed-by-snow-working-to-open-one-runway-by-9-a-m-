Fraport AG’s Frankfurt airport was
closed just after 5 a.m. today for snow clearance, with crews
now working toward getting one runway opened between 8 a.m. and
9 a.m., spokesman Juergen Harrer said in a telephone interview.
He said Fraport was aiming to have the other two runways open
before noon.  The airport experienced a very heavy snowfall in a short
time starting around 3 a.m., and it was determined snow-
clearance crews could not safely clear it if aircraft were using
the runways, Harrer said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
