What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that rising
demand for ethanol will reduce U.S. grain inventories and hot,
dry weather will damage crops in Argentina, said  Greg Grow , the
director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents higher in Chicago
as adverse weather in Brazil and Argentina threatens to reduce
output and increase demand for U.S. supplies, Grow said.
Soybean-meal futures may open unchanged to $1 higher per 2,000
pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open up 0.05 cent to 0.1
cent a pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange after unusually heavy rain reduced the supply of
milling-quality wheat in Australia and dry weather erodes
prospects for winter grain in the U.S. and China, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
