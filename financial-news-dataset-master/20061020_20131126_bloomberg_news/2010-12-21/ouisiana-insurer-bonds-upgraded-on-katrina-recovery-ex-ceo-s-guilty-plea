Insurance Corp.  bonds were upgraded as the state recovers from
Hurricane Katrina and management improves following the guilty
plea of a former leader, Moody’s Investors Service said.  The insurer, founded in 2003 to provide coverage for state
residents unable to get home insurance from private carriers,
had its assessment revenue bonds raised one level to Baa1, the
eighth-highest of 10 investment-grade ratings, according to a
statement today from the credit-rating firm.  Citizens probably has about $300 million in available cash,
compared with $213 million in 2008, when hurricanes Ike and
Gustav struck, Moody’s said. The insurer turned to debt markets
after incurring $1.1 billion of losses when hurricanes Katrina
and Rita pressured reserves in 2005, the costliest year in the
U.S. for storms. The insurer is also recovering from missteps by
ex-Chief Executive Officer Terry Lisotta, the ratings firm said.  “The rating upgrade reflects strengthened management and
administrative processes,” Moody’s said in the statement. The
company benefited from private insurers taking some of its
customers and from the state avoiding damage from major
hurricanes this year and in 2009, the ratings firm said.  Lisotta pleaded guilty to theft by fraud and was sentenced
in April to 30 months of hard labor for illegally taking about
$30,000 from the insurer, according to  The Times-Picayune .
Citizens can raise funds through assessments on private
insurers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
