JSW Steel Ltd. , which agreed to buy
a controlling stake in Ispat Industries Ltd., plans to assume as
much as 90 billion rupees ($2 billion) of Ispat’s debt,
according to two bankers with direct knowledge of the matter.  JSW, India’s third-biggest steelmaker, intends to refinance
the debt, the bankers said, requesting anonymity before an
official announcement. The debt restructuring may take place
within six months of the acquisition, one of the bankers said.  Refinancing the debt may save between 2 and 3 percentage
points in interest costs, the bankers said.  Ispat ’s average cost
of funds is about 12 percent, compared with about 7 percent for
Mumbai-based JSW, they said.  Ispat has total debt of about 85 billion rupees, Executive
Director Anil Sureka told reporters in Kolkata. The debt may be
refinanced “in the near future,” he said. Sharmila Banerjee,
spokeswoman at JSW, and Monaesha Pinto, Ispat’s spokeswoman,
declined to comment.  JSW today agreed to take control of Kolkata-based Ispat for
about 21.6 billion rupees in the biggest acquisition by an
Indian steelmaker in 3 1/2 years. Ispat, owned by the brothers
of billionaire  L. N. Mittal , owed about $1.5 billion to lenders
including IFCI Ltd., IDBI Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd.,
according to a company presentation in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
