South Africa’s rand strengthened
against the dollar for a second day as prices of the nation’s
commodity exports rose, boosting the foreign-earnings prospects
of Africa’s biggest economy.  The currency appreciated as much as 0.7 percent to 6.7959
per dollar and traded at 6.8119 by 4 p.m. in Johannesburg, from
a previous close of 6.8465. Against the euro, the rand added 0.1
percent to 8.9793.  Gold, which together with platinum accounts for about a
fifth of South Africa’s exports, advanced as concern that
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis may worsen boosted the appeal of
precious metals as alternative investments. Platinum also gained
after Moody’s Investors Service placed Portugal’s A1 long-term
credit rating on review for possible downgrade.  “Commodity prices are rising steadily and remain in a bull
run,” Tradition Analytics analysts, led by  Quinten Bertenshaw 
in Johannesburg, wrote in a client note today. “The conclusion
to be drawn is that for now, corporates and traders should
consider the possibility that 2011 is yet another strong year
for the rand.”  South Africa, with more than $2.5 trillion in mineral
reserves, is the world’s richest nation by “commodity wealth”
followed by Russia and Australia, Citigroup Inc. said in April.  Government bonds advanced for a third day, with the
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 climbing 4
cents to 123.89 rand. The yield on the bond declined 1 basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
