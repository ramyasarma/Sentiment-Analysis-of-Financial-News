(Corrects first paragraph to say Italy is euro region’s
third-biggest economy.)  Italy’s  unemployment rate  declined
in the three months through September from near the highest
since 2003 as the euro region’s third-biggest  economy  expanded
for a third quarter.  Joblessness fell to a seasonally adjusted 8.3 percent, from
a revised 8.4 percent, statistics institute  Istat  said today in
Rome. Economists had predicted a rate of 8.3 percent, according
to the median of four forecasts in a  Bloomberg News survey .  Household confidence  gained last month to the highest in
almost a year as Italian consumers became more optimistic about
the economic outlook. Italy’s  gross domestic product  expanded
0.3 percent in the three months through September, more than the
0.2 percent previously estimated, Istat said on Dec. 13. Growth
was sustained by a 2.8 percent increase in  exports  as  consumer
spending  advanced 0.3 percent, the institute said.  There are signs the recovery is losing momentum in the
fourth quarter and employment gains may not last. The jobless
rate climbed to 8.6 percent in October, the highest since
monthly records began in 2004, Istat said on Nov. 30. With
companies such as airline  Alitalia SpA  and Italy’s biggest home-
appliance maker  Indesit SpA  planning to reduce or relocate
workers, household spending may not rise in coming months.  Alitalia is seeking to scrap 400 jobs and outsource 300
positions to other airports by June to help the carrier break
even in 2011, newspaper la Repubblica reported on Dec. 7, citing
labor unions. Indesit said this month it is closing plants near
the cities of Bergamo and Treviso and offered workers incentives
to relocate to the central and southern cities of Fabriano and
Caserta. Those left jobless will be offered unspecified
alternative arrangements, the company said.  Layoffs’ Fund  Gains in unemployment this year were limited by the use of
a state-backed fund for temporary layoffs known as cassa
integrazione that pays redundant workers about 80 percent of
their latest salary. About 600,000 workers receive payments
under the CIG program, according to a Dec. 12  report  by CGIL,
Italy’s biggest union.  The real joblessness rate, which includes those paid by the
fund, exceeded 11 percent in the second quarter, the Bank of
Italy said in an Oct. 15 report.  Employers’ lobby  Confindustria  forecast in a report last
week that unemployment will reach 8.5 percent in 2010 and climb
to 9 percent in the fourth quarter of next year. Confindustria
revised its growth forecast for 2010 to 1 percent from a Sept.
16 estimate of 1.2 percent.  The Finance Ministry predicted in September that the $2.3
trillion economy will expand 1.2 percent this year, more than
the 1 percent it projected in May.  Istat originally reported an unemployment rate of 8.5
percent in the second quarter, the highest in seven years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
