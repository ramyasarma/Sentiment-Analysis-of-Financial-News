Germany may cut solar-power
subsidies earlier than planned,  Focus-Money  reported, citing a
spokesman at the Environment Ministry.  The industry may be ready to advance some of the cuts to
mid-2011 if the market shows strong growth next year, the
magazine reported, citing  Carsten Koernig , head of the BSW
German solar-industry lobby group.  The cut in subsidies was originally planned for Jan. 1,
2012, Focus-Money said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
