The investor group that owns the
Montreal Canadiens repaid a C$75 million ($74 million)
provincial government loan that helped finance the transaction
last year, Quebec Economic Development Minister  Clement Gignac 
said.  CH Group LP Chairman  Geoffrey Molson , whose family controls
the National Hockey League team, said the investors repaid the
loan after completing a refinancing. The loan, made by the
province’s Investissement Quebec financing arm, was to last as
long as 10 years, the government said today in a  statement  on
its website.  While CH Group never disclosed how much it paid for the
team, Montreal’s Bell Centre arena and a concert-promotion
business, ESPN reported that the price exceeded $550 million.  Besides the Molson family, the group includes Montreal-
based  BCE  Inc., Canada’s largest telecommunications company;
Solidarity Fund QFL, a Montreal-based labor-sponsored fund with
C$7.3 billion in assets; Woodbridge Co., the holding company of
Toronto’s Thomson family; Canadian transport executive  Michael Andlauer ; and  Luc Bertrand , the former chief executive officer
of the Montreal Exchange.  To contact the reporter for this story:
