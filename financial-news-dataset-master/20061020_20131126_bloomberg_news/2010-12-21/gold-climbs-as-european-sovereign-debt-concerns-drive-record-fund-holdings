Gold, little changed in London and
New York, may rise for the third straight day on speculation a
weaker dollar will boost record investment demand through
exchange-traded products.  The U.S. Dollar Index fell for the first time in three
sessions against a basket of six major currencies. Gold often
moves inversely to the dollar. Gold assets in ETPs rose to a
record  2,114.6  metric tons as of yesterday, according to data
collected by Bloomberg from 10 providers.  “We continue swinging alongside the broader market with
direction mostly from currency markets, and bullion is still
trading against the dollar,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London.  Immediate-delivery bullion rose $1.62, or 0.1 percent, to
$1,386.87 an ounce at 11:48 a.m. in London. Bullion for February
delivery on the Comex in New York increased $1.20 to $1,387.30
an ounce.  Gold has gained 26 percent this year, set for a 10th annual
gain, as the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and so-called
quantitative easing in the U.S. hurt currencies and aided
demand.  “It should push through fresh record highs early next
year,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said on Bloomberg Television’s
First Up program today. “We see it moving toward a peak of
around $1,550 by around September.”  American Eagle  gold-coin sales  plummeted, falling to 56,000
so far this month, below the 122,500 sold in November and the
612,000 during December 2009, U.S. government data show.  Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at
$29.3325 an ounce. Silver holdings in ETPs fell 0.7 percent to
15,073.22 tons as of yesterday  Spot palladium rose 0.8 percent to $748.08 an ounce, while
immediate-delivery platinum gained $4.25, or 0.2 percent, to
$1,716 an ounce.  Chinese platinum imports  jumped to 8.5 million tons,
probably on speculative demand and not increases in jewelry or
industrial demand, said  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
