Naphtha margins in Asia fell for a
second day after the cost of crude oil climbed. JX Nippon Oil &
Energy Corp. started a catalytic cracker unit at its Kashima
refinery yesterday.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for second-half February were bid at $863.75 a metric
ton to offers at $866.75 today, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. First-half March cargoes were bid at
$859.75 a ton to offers at $862.75. Yesterday, naphtha prices
for mid-February to mid-March delivery closed at $854.75,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Naphtha’s crack spread to Brent crude declined to $159.99 a
ton from $163.66 yesterday, Bloomberg calculations showed.  European exports of the fuel may reach 475,000 tons in
December, according to the median estimate of eight traders
surveyed by Bloomberg earlier this month. About 500,000 tons
were shipped to Asia in November and none in October.  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. restarted its 35,500 barrel-a-
day fluid catalytic cracker at its Kashima refinery in eastern
Japan yesterday, company spokeswoman said. The cracker was shut
on Dec. 7 because of a mechanical glitch.  Middle Distillates  January swaps for  gasoil , or diesel, were at $102.75 a
barrel, PVM data showed. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude was
unchanged at $13.23 a barrel, the lowest since Nov. 30. This
 crack spread  rose to $15.43 on Dec. 7, the widest since January
2009. It has since fallen 14 percent in the past two weeks on
signs that a fuel shortage in China is easing.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged at $1.20 a
barrel. This  regrade  has increased 15 cents from Dec. 14,
signaling that aviation fuel is relatively more profitable than
diesel for refiners compared with a week earlier.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude, a measure of refining
losses from making the fuel in Asia, was at $10.48 a barrel at
10 a.m. Singapore time, unchanged from yesterday, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates, a brokerage. The spread is at the
widest since Dec. 9.  High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for January were
unchanged at $513.75 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
