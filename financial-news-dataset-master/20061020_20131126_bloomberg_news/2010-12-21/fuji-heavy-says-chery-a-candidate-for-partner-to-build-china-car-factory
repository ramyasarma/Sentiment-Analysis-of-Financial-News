Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., owner of
the Subaru car brand, is considering Chery Automobile Co. as a
partner in China, spokesman Kenta Matsumoto said by phone from
Tokyo today.  Chery is one of several candidates and nothing has been
decided, Matsumoto said. The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier
today that Fuji Heavy and Chery plan to invest about 30 billion
yen ($360 million) to build a new 150,000 capacity plant in
China with production set to begin in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
