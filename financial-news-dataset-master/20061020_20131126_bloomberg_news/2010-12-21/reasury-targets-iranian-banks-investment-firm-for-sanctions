The U.S. Treasury Department today
said it targeted an Iranian investment firm and other entities
for financial sanctions aimed at preventing the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.  Today’s sanctions affect entities with links to the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran
Shipping Lines, the department said. The Treasury said those two
organizations have engaged in ‘illicit activities and deceptive
behavior” to avoid existing financial blockades.  The targeted firms include Bonyad Taavon Sepah, which the
Treasury said manages investments for the guard corps, along
with Ansar Bank, Mehr Bank and Moallem Insurance Company. The
Treasury also designated Liner Transport Kish for providing
weapons and other material support to Hezbollah on behalf of
Iran.  “Our policy will be to continue to impose pressure on Iran
so long as it fails to live up to its international
obligations,” said  Stuart Levey , the Treasury’s undersecretary
for terrorism and financial intelligence, in comments to
reporters in Washington. He said Iran’s government was facing
“real anxiety” from the ongoing effort to shut down its
financial channels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
