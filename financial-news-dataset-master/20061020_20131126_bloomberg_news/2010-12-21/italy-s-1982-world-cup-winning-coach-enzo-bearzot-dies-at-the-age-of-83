Enzo Bearzot, who coached Italy to a
third World Cup soccer victory in 1982, died at the age of 83,
Italy’s soccer federation FGIC said today in a statement on its
website.  Dubbed “Il Vecio”, the old one, Bearzot is remembered for
playing cards with then Italian president Sandro Pertini on the
plane back from Spain after winning the World Cup. He coached
Italy from 1977 to 1986.  “We lost an extraordinary person, an honest and brave
man,” Dino Zoff, captain of the 1982 team, told Sky Italia
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
