Satyam Computer Services Ltd. , the
software exporter embroiled in India’s biggest corporate fraud
probe, will consider relisting on the New York Stock Exchange
after filing its financial accounts as per U.S. standards.  The company is “working toward” making the  accounts  U.S.
GAAP compliant, Chief Marketing Officer  Hari Thalapalli  said in
a phone interview today. Hyderabad-based Satyam hasn’t yet made
a decision on the relisting, he said.  Satyam said in September its American depositary receipts
would be delisted from the NYSE and may trade on the over-the-
counter market. The company’s accounts may become U.S. GAAP
compliant in about six to eight months, Chairman  Vineet Nayyar 
said on Sept. 29.  Satyam  jumped 9 percent, the most since Sept. 22, to 69
rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai trading. The stock has
declined 30 percent this year after a 43 percent drop in 2009.  The company reported its first annual earnings in two years
in September after former Chairman  Ramalinga Raju  disclosed in
January 2009 that he overstated Satyam’s assets by $1 billion,
triggering a stock plunge and investor lawsuits in the U.S.  Tech
Mahindra Ltd. , based in Pune, last year acquired control of the
software-services provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
