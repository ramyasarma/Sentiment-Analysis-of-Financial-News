The ruble rose to its strongest
level this week against the dollar as Chinese assistance to
Europe boosted the appeal of emerging-market assets and oil and
metals prices rose.  Russia’s currency gained as much as 0.4 percent to 30.6649
per dollar today, the strongest since Dec. 17, before closing
0.2 percent stronger at 30.7420 by 5 p.m. in Moscow. After
climbing 0.4 percent to 40.3742 per euro, it ended the day
little changed at 40.50 against the common currency.  With the price of oil, Russia’s chief export earner, up 6.6
percent in December, the ruble has gained 2.5 percent versus the
dollar, headed for its best month since July, and 1.2 percent
against the euro. All but two of the 25 emerging-market
currencies monitored by Bloomberg strengthened against the
dollar today as Chinese Vice Premier  Wang Qishan  said the
country had taken “concrete action” to help the European Union
with its debt problems. Investors sought riskier assets amid
speculation China is investing in Europe.  “The strength of external commodity prices will drive the
ruble,”  Bartosz Pawlowski , head of currency and interest rates
strategy for central and eastern Europe, the Middle East and
Africa at BNP Paribas SA, France’s largest bank, said by phone
from London. “Our scenario of ruble strength may have been
brought forward.”  The  ruble  was steady at 35.1332 against the dollar-euro
basket used by Russia’s central bank to manage the currency and
limit swings that disadvantage exporters. The basket, which was
introduced in 2005, is calculated by multiplying the dollar-
ruble rate by 0.55, the euro-ruble rate by 0.45, then adding
them together.  ‘Top Trades’  BNP last week advised clients to take so-called long
positions on the ruble against the euro once the exchange rate
hits around 40.50 per euro, Pawlowski said, calling it one of
the bank’s “top trades” for 2011.  “The ruble is an undervalued currency,” Pawlowski said.  The currency has strengthened 1.8 percent versus the
 dollar-euro basket  this month, bound for the biggest monthly
advance since March. It has appreciated 2.1 percent against the
basket this year, the largest annual gain since 2006.  Direct ruble trading against China’s yuan started on
Moscow’s Micex exchange Dec. 16 and is currently restricted to
an hour a day. Russia’s currency was little changed at 46.1425
per 10 yuan at the 11 a.m. close of trading today.  Russia’s dollar bonds due 2020 rose today, pushing the
yield down 11 basis points to 5.03 percent. The yield on
government ruble bonds maturing 2016 fell 1 basis point to 7.60
percent.  Nickel prices in London added 0.5 percent and the price of
copper surged 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
