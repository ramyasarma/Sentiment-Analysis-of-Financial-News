Moody’s Investors Service said it
does not know if Portugal will ask for a bailout and does not
see accessing the European Financial Stability Facility as
“negative.”  Moody’s will “evaluate” the situation if Portugal does
request a bailout, Kathrin Muehlbronner, an analyst at Moody’s,
said in a telephone interview today.  Portugal may have its bond rating cut by a notch or two due
to concerns over the economy’s “sluggish” growth, Moody’s said
in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
