The Swiss franc strengthened as
investors sought a haven from fluctuations in the euro after
Moody’s Investors Service said it may cut Portugal’s credit
rating.  The Swiss currency gained against 14 of its 16 most
actively traded counterparts as Moody’s placed  Portugal’s A1
long-term rating and Prime-1 short-term rating on review,
reinforcing concerns that some European nations will struggle to
raise funds amid a slew of credit-rating and outlook changes.  “European currencies which are backed up by strong
economic fundamentals, like the Swiss franc, have
strengthened,” said  Henrik Gullberg , a currency strategist at
Deutsche Bank AG in London.  The franc appreciated 0.3 percent to 96.20 centimes against
the dollar at 9 a.m. in London. It erased declines to trade 0.1
percent stronger against the euro at 1.2652, after touching to a
euro-era record of 1.2636.  To contact the reporter on this story:
