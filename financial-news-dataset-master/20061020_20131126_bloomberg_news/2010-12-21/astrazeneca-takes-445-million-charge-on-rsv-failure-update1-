AstraZeneca Plc  will take a charge
of $445 million in the fourth quarter after stopping development
of the motavizumab drug for the prevention of a serious
respiratory disease that affects babies.  The company has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
to withdraw its pending application for approval in preventing
respiratory syncytial virus, the London-based company said in a
statement today. The drug is still being developed for use in
treatment of RSV, AstraZeneca said.  Outside advisers to the FDA on June 2 recommended against
approval of the drug because studies linked it to allergic
reactions and didn’t prove it worked better than the company’s
older medicine Synagis. Motavizumab was designed to replace
Synagis before its patent expires in 2015. AstraZeneca acquired
both medicines in 2007 with its $15.2 billion purchase of U.S.-
based MedImmune.  Almost all babies have been infected at least once with RSV
by their second birthday, often causing bronchitis or pneumonia,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.  Synagis and motavizumab were designed to prevent the virus
in high-risk children, including babies born prematurely. Babies
with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease, or with
weakened immune systems, also have a greater chance of
developing severe illness from the virus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
