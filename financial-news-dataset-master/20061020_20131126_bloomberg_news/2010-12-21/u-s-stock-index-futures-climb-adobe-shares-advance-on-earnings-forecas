U.S. stocks rose, completing the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index’s recovery from the plunge that
followed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse in 2008, after
 Adobe Systems Inc. ’s forecast added to speculation that the
fastest profit growth in 22 years makes equities a bargain.  The benchmark gauge of U.S.  stocks  rose 0.6 percent to
1,254.60 at 4 p.m. in New York, surpassing its close of 1,251.70
on Sept. 12, 2008, the last session before New York-based Lehman
Brothers filed the world’s biggest bankruptcy. The economic
expansion starting in June 2009 has driven an 85 percent surge
in the stock index since it sank to a 12-year low of 676.53 on
March 9, 2009, restoring about $7 trillion of U.S. equity value.  U.S. government and Federal Reserve spending to stimulate
the economy and more than 70 percent of S&P 500 companies
beating profit  estimates  for a record six straight quarters
drove equities. The index will end 2011 at 1,374, according to
the average forecast of 11 strategists at Wall Street’s biggest
banks, producing the biggest three-year rally since 1997-2000.  “Lehman Brothers was really the starting gun for creating
this sense of fear, and we still haven’t fully overcome that
fear, but we’re in a healing process,” said  Jeffrey Coons ,
president of Manning & Napier Advisors Inc. in Fairport, New
York, which manages $35 billion. “The aggressive moves of the
Fed right after Lehman and ongoing today have been an important
driver for the stabilization of stock prices. It’s still going
to be a difficult growth environment, but the natural
improvement in the economy is beginning to take hold.”  Adobe, Macy’s  Adobe , the top maker of graphic-design programs, rallied 6
percent.  Banks  had the biggest gain of 24 industry groups in the
S&P 500 after Canada’s Toronto-Dominion Bank agreed to buy
Chrysler Financial Corp., raising investor expectation for more
deals in the industry.  Macy’s Inc.  and Limited Brands Inc.
climbed at least 1.5 percent as a gauge of same-store sales at
U.S. retailers posted the biggest jump of this holiday season.  The S&P 500 rose for the fourth day and the 10th day in the
past 11. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average , which erased its
post-Lehman Brothers loss last month, climbed 55.03 points, or
0.5 percent, to 11,533.16.  Earnings among S&P 500 companies are projected to increase
14 percent next year and 13 percent in 2012, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge of the
biggest U.S. stocks trades for an average of 12.9 times next
year’s forecast for combined earnings, compared with an average
price-earnings ratio of 16.4 since 1956, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  ‘Increased Confidence’  “There’s increased confidence in what the future looks
like, at least in the U.S.,” said  James Dunigan , chief
investment officer at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia,
which oversees $105 billion. “Corporate earnings and forecasts
are strong and the economic picture has improved. In the event
we don’t have any bad surprises from Europe, stocks will be the
investment of choice.”  The drop in the S&P 500 totaled 46 percent between Lehman’s
failure and the bear-market low on March 9, 2009, as the worst
recession since the 1930s intensified. The index started to
rebound three months before the contraction ended in June 2009,
according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. It must
climb 25 percent to surpass its October 2007 record high of
1,565.15.  Teetered on Collapse  In the week of Lehman’s bankruptcy,  Bank of America Corp. 
took over Merrill Lynch & Co. as it teetered on collapse and the
government seized control of American International Group Inc.
The S&P 500 surged in the final two days of that week after the
government announced a plan to purge banks of bad assets and
crack down on short sellers.  The S&P 500, up 13 percent in 2010, has advanced 6.3
percent in December after losing 0.2 percent in November and
posting a combined gain of 13 percent in  September  and October,
the biggest increase during those months since 1998. The measure
has rallied 20 percent since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
suggested on Aug. 27 that he was prepared to purchase bonds to
spur economic growth.  Adobe rallied 6 percent to $30.93. First-quarter profit
will exceeded  analysts’ estimates , lifted by resurgent sales of
publishing software. Excluding some costs, profit will be 54
cents to 59 cents a share in the period ending in February, San
Jose, California-based Adobe said. Analysts had  estimated  51
cents on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jabil, Retailers  Jabil Circuit Inc.  had the biggest gain in the S&P 500,
jumping 11 percent to $19.55. The St. Petersburg, Florida-based
electronics manufacturer forecast second-quarter earnings of at
least 49 cents a share, exceeding the average of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Banks rallied the most among  24 groups in the S&P 500 ,
rising 2.1 percent collectively. Toronto-Dominion Bank agreed to
buy Chrysler Financial Corp. from Cerberus Capital Management LP
for $6.3 billion in cash, adding an auto-finance company in its
second-largest acquisition. The deal comes after Bank of
Montreal’s Dec. 17 agreement to buy Wisconsin lender Marshall &
Ilsley Corp. for about $4.1 billion in stock.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  jumped 2.6 percent to $41, while Bank
of America added 2.9 percent to $12.98.  Retailers also gained. Same-store sales at a selection of
U.S. retailers rose 4.2 percent last week as more consumers
finished shopping, according to a survey of retailers. Almost 74
percent of shoppers completed gift buying in the week ended Dec.
18. That compared with 56.6 percent a week earlier, according to
a chain-store sales index released today by International
Council of Shopping Centers and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.   Macy’s  Macy’s , the second-biggest U.S. department-store chain,
added 1.5 percent to $25.98. Limited Brands, owner of the
Victoria’s Secret chain, advanced 2.1 percent to $31.73.  Carnival Corp.  rose 4.5 percent to $45.18. The world’s
biggest cruise-line operator forecast fiscal 2011 earnings will
rise as ticket prices strengthen. Full-year  earnings  will be
between $2.90 and $3.10 a share, up from $2.47 in fiscal 2010,
Miami-based Carnival said. Analysts  predicted  $2.94, the average
of 28 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Amazon.com Inc.  climbed 0.8 percent to $184.75. The largest
online retailer is likely to sell more than 8 million Kindle
electronic-book readers this year, at least 60 percent more than
analysts have predicted, according to two people who are aware
of the company’s projections. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated, on average, 5 million Kindle sales in 2010.  Dell Inc.  gained 3.6 percent to $13.84. Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Dell  bought 7.37 million shares of the world’s
third-largest personal-computer maker on Dec. 17, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday.  Gains in U.S. stocks also followed an advance in Asian and
European equities. Chinese Vice Premier  Wang Qishan  said the
world’s second-largest economy “has taken steps to help some
European Union members counter the sovereign-debt crisis.”
Separately, Moody’s Investors Service said it doesn’t foresee
defaults or maturity extensions on euro-area debt because the
region will likely backstop weaker members, and reiterated that
Portugal will likely stay investment-grade.  To contact the reporter for this story:
