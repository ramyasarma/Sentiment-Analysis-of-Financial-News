(Corrects amounts to $65 billion in investments and
$20 billion in losses in 14th paragraph.)  Annette Bongiorno , the former aide
to  Bernard Madoff  indicted last month for her alleged role in
his massive Ponzi scheme, was ordered to surrender to U.S.
authorities after her bail was revoked by a judge in New York.  U.S. District Judge  Laura Taylor Swain  ruled today that
Bongiorno has access to millions of dollars that may help her to
flee. Swain rejected a proposal by Bongiorno’s lawyers to place
funds held by her and her husband under the supervision of a
monitor to be hired with her money.  Swain ordered Bongiorno to surrender to U.S. marshals in
southern Florida by 3 p.m. today. The federal appeals court in
New York denied a request by Bongiorno’s attorneys to delay the
order today.  “This process has been excruciating for her,” Maurice
Sercarz, one of Bongiorno’s lawyers, said in an interview after
the hearing today. “Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa - she didn’t
want to go in,” Sercarz said when asked whether Bongiorno had
expressed a desire to remain free to celebrate Christmas.  Bongiorno is charged with conspiracy, securities fraud,
falsifying records and tax evasion. She faces as long as life in
prison if convicted. She has pleaded not guilty.  Bongiorno Finances  Prosecutors told Swain in an earlier hearing that Bongiorno
has $2.4 million in cash, plus access to an undetermined amount
of money held by her husband, Rudy Bongiorno, who withdrew about
$3.8 million from a Madoff account over many years.  Prosecutors have argued that the money belongs to victims
of the Madoff fraud and can’t be used to meet the $5 million
bond originally set by Swain. The government has said it may try
to seize any funds held by the Bongiornos.  Bongiorno’s attorneys submitted information, to Swain only,
about Annette and Rudy Bongiorno’s finances. Yesterday they
filed a request that Swain approve a plan to hire a firm to
monitor the Bongiornos’ finances and report to the judge.  Swain rejected the request today, saying there is “no
condition or combination of conditions that will reasonably
assure Ms. Bongiorno’s presence at trial.”  After the hearing, Sercarz said that it will be much more
difficult to prepare Bongiorno’s defense, in a case involving
millions of documents, with his client in jail.  ‘Get Her Out’  “We’ve got to keep working to get her out,” Sercarz said.  Bongiorno, who has homes in Manhasset, New York, and Boca
Raton, Florida, is currently in the Florida house. Her lawyers
told Swain she is afraid to fly.  Bongiorno began working for Madoff in 1968 after she
graduated from high school. She oversaw about 200 accounts at
Bernard Madoff Investment Securities LLC, Madoff’s fraudulent
financial advisory firm, according to prosecutors.  Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year sentence in a North
Carolina federal prison after admitting he ran the largest Ponzi
scheme in history. At the time of his arrest in 2008, client
account statements reflected about $65 billion in non-existent
investments. Investors lost about $20 billion in principal.  The case is: U.S. v. O’Hara, 10-228, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
