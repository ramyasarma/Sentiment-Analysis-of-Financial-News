Winston & Strawn LLP ex-partner
Jonathan Bristol pleaded guilty to charges that he helped
launder almost $19 million in financial adviser  Kenneth I. Starr ’s investment fraud.  Bristol admitted today to a charge of conspiracy to launder
money before U.S. District Judge Deborah A. Batts, U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara in  Manhattan  said in an e-mailed statement.  Starr, the  New York  money manager whose clients included
actors Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes, was sentenced to
7 1/2 years in prison March 2 after pleading guilty to
defrauding nine celebrities out of $33.3 million. Bristol
admitted that he allowed Starr to wire funds in and out of his
escrow account, knowing that the funds were proceeds of Starr’s
fraud, Bharara said in the statement.  Bristol “abused his position as a partner at a prominent
New York City law firm to break the law over and over again,”
Bharara said in the statement. “Bristol should have been a
gatekeeper; instead, he was an enabler to  Kenneth Starr  and his
multimillion-dollar fraud.”  Bristol faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison
and a fine of $250,000, and agreed to pay restitution of $18.9
million, according to the statement. His sentencing is scheduled
for Sept. 26.  Bristol’s lawyer, Susan Kellman, didn’t immediately return
a call seeking comment.  The case is U.S. v. Bristol, 10-cr-1239, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
