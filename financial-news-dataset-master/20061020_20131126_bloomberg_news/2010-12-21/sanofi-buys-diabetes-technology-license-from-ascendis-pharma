Sanofi-Aventis SA  agreed to buy a
technology from Ascendis Pharma A/S that allows drugs to be
delivered in the body slowly and regularly, extending the effect
of the medicine.  Sanofi bought rights to develop and sell the technology
along with medicines for diabetes, the Paris-based company said
in an e-mailed statement today. The technology showed
“promising results” with insulin in early tests, Sanofi said.  Diabetes occurs when the body doesn’t produce or properly
use insulin, a hormone needed to convert sugar, starches and
other food into the energy needed for daily life.  To contact the reporter on this story:
