Munich Re , the world’s biggest
reinsurer, plans to work with brokers on developing coverage for
deepwater drilling in U.S. waters.  Guy Carpenter, a unit of  Marsh & McLennan Cos. ; Willis Re,
the reinsurance broker of  Willis Group Holdings Ltd. ; and Aon
Benfield, a unit of  Aon Corp. , will help develop a new “sudden
oil spill” group, the Munich-based company and Aon Benfield
said in a joint e-mailed  statement  today. Aon Benfield will
manage the initiative that expands on a plan announced
previously by Munich Re, they said.  As a response to the April blowout on the Deepwater Horizon
rig that caused the Macondo well to leak crude oil into the Gulf
of Mexico until July, Munich Re said in September that it was
planning to develop coverage for oil-drilling operators in the
region. The company said at the time it wanted to offer $10
billion to $20 billion of individual liability coverage, of
which it would commit as much as $2 billion.  Munich Re is “in the process of committing significant
capacity” to this new form of coverage along with other
reinsurers and insurers, it said today. The group “will work
alongside the oil industry to deliver a solution that will help
ensure that the product will deliver limits on a per well basis
that have not been available before in the marketplace,”
according to the statement.  Drilling operators can currently buy liability insurance
paying out a maximum of $1.5 billion covering all their
activities, Munich Re  said  in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
