France’s decision to suspend most
solar-energy projects for three months was done partly to curb
cheaper imports of Chinese solar panels, Environment Minister
 Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet  said today on  France Info  radio.  “Ninety percent of the solar panels installed in France
come from China and our import criteria must be strengthened,”
Kosciusko-Morizet said. “We are not here to subsidize the
Chinese economy but to create green jobs in France.”  European governments are revising solar policies after
realizing their subsidies were too generous and that developers
bought a majority of the panels from Chinese suppliers including
Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. rather than manufacturers such
as Q-Cells SE of Germany or Spain’s Solaria Energia & Medio
Ambiente SA.  France on Dec. 10 suspended projects for three months as it
studies whether to limit construction and further cut subsidized
rates paid to solar-power producers. The feed-in tariffs, among
Europe’s highest, sparked a boom in project applications and
France, following similar moves in Spain and Germany, is seeking
to limit the spiraling cost of clean energy for consumers.  The French halt applies to projects with a capacity of more
than 3 kilowatts. The rules will allow projects that agreed on
earning the subsidized rates more than nine months ago with
Electricite de France SA to go ahead as long as generation is
started within 18 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
