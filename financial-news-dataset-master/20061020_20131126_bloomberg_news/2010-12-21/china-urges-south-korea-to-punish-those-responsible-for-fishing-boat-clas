China urged South Korea to pay
compensation and punish those responsible for a clash between
Chinese fishing boats and the Korean Coast Guard, which left one
fisherman dead and another missing.  "China asks South Korea to severely punish perpetrators,
compensate losses to life and property on the Chinese side and
take effective measures to prevent similar incidents,"  Foreign
Ministry  Spokeswoman  Jiang Yu  told reporters in Beijing today.
"We are seriously concerned about the incident and have solemnly
raised the issue to South Korea."  South Korea maintains that the Dec. 18 collision took place
after the Coast Guard discovered about 50 boats from China
illegally fishing in South Korean waters. The Coast Guard said
four of its officers were injured when the crew from one vessel
resisted their attempts to board.  Jiang declined to specify whether the perpetrators she
referred to were from the Korean side. She also said the
incident "had no direct relation to the current tense situation
on the Korean peninsula."  "No matter in what waters, fishing boat clashes and the
causing of losses and injuries isn’t something that should have
happened," Jiang said. Neither country’s law enforcement boats
have the right to board one another’s fishing vessels, she said,
citing a bilateral fishery agreement.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story
