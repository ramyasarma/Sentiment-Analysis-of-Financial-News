Citigroup Inc. won the right to
recoup legal fees it spent to win dismissal of a lawsuit by six
former brokers who said they shouldn’t have to pay back the
balance on their signing-bonus loans totaling $1.51 million.  U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in New York granted
Citigroup’s legal-fee request in a ruling today. Kaplan
dismissed the brokers’ claims in April. The amount of the fees
isn’t determined yet.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
