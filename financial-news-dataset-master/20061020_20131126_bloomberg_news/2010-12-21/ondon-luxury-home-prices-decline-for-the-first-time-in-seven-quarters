London luxury-home prices fell for
the first time in seven quarters in the final three months of
2010 as prospects of slowing economic growth and higher taxes
deterred buyers,  Savills Plc  said.  The average value of a home in Britain’s capital costing
more than 1 million pounds ($1.54 million) fell 0.2 percent from
September through December, according to an index compiled by
the  London-based property broker . That trimmed this year’s
increase to 4.6 percent, which is down from an 8.9 percent gain
in 2009.  Savills predicts that prices of luxury homes in London
neighborhoods ranging from Islington to Richmond and Chelsea
will fall by about 1 percent next year as the government takes
steps to cut a record deficit. The cost of moving into a luxury
home will approach 10 percent of the purchase price in 2011 as
value-added and property sales taxes increase, broker W.A. Ellis
LLP estimates.  “The numbers of people looking for property have fallen
significantly over the year,”  Yolande Barnes , Savills’s head of
residential research, said in the report. “The best London
properties do not require large numbers of applicants, but
rather the right, few, highly motivated buyers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
