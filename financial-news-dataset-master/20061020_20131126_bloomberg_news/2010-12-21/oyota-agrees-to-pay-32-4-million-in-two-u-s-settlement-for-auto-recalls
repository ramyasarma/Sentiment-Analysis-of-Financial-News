Toyota Motor Corp.  agreed to pay a
combined $32.4 million in two settlements with the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration related to auto recalls,
according to a statement on the carmaker’s website.  “These agreements are an opportunity to turn the page to
an even more constructive relationship with NHTSA,”  Steve St. Angelo , Toyota’s Chief Quality Officer for North America, said
in the statement.  The settlements concern the timeliness of recalls conducted
by the company in 2005 to fix steering relay rods and to assess
pedals that may have become trapped by floormats from 2007 to
early 2010, Toyota said in the statement. The payments follow an
earlier $16.4 million U.S. fine in May for failing to alert
auto-safety regulators quickly enough about vehicle defects.  “More than the amount of the settlements, how Toyota’s
brand image will recover is a bigger concern,” said  Masatoshi Nishimoto , an analyst at consulting company IHS Automotive in
Tokyo. “Toyota’s sales growth in North America this year is
much smaller than competitors.”  Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, is battling to
recover its reputation for safety and reliability after record
recalls including the repair of more than 8 million vehicles for
problems related to unintended acceleration. Sales at the Toyota
City, Japan-based automaker have trailed rivals in the U.S. this
year, rising 0.2 percent through November, compared with a 7
percent increase at General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co.’s 21
percent growth.  Shares  in Toyota rose 1.2 percent to 3,270 yen as of 12:36
p.m. in Tokyo. The stock has fallen 16 percent in 2010, compared
with a 2 percent decline in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
