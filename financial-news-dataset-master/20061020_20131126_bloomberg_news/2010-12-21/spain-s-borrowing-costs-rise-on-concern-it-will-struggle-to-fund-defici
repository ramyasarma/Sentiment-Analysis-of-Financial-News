Spain sold 3.88 billion euros ($5.1
billion) of three- and six-month Treasury bills, near the
maximum target, as borrowing costs rose amid lingering concern
the nation will struggle to fund its deficit.  The Treasury auctioned 3 billion euros of 84-day bills at
an average yield of 1.804 percent, the Bank of Spain said today
in Madrid. That compares with 1.743 percent when the securities
were last issued on Nov. 23. The government sold 876.7 million
euros of 175-day debt at 2.597 percent, up from 2.111 percent
last month. It aimed to sell a maximum of 4 billion euros from
the two sales.  “The result looks good, especially considering the current
difficult environment for periphery and the negative rating
drift we have observed over the last week,”  Chiara Cremonesi , a
fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in London, wrote today
in a report. The six-month yield was “lower than the secondary
market ahead of the auction,” while the three-month yield was
“slightly higher than the market,” she said.  Spain is seeking to convince investors it won’t need to
follow Ireland in needing a European bailout. Moody’s Investors
Service said on Dec. 15 it may lower the nation’s Aa1 rating as
the 290 billion euros it estimates banks, the government and
regional administrations must raise next year make it
“susceptible to further episodes of funding stress.”  Costs ‘In Line’  The rising  borrowing  costs remain “in line” with what the
Treasury estimated at the start of the year, Deputy Finance
Minister  Carlos Ocana  said today as he released data showing the
central government’s budget deficit narrowed 46 percent from a
year earlier in the first 11 months of the year, to 3.68 percent
of gross domestic product. The central government targeted a
full-year shortfall of 6.7 percent.  The overall Spanish budget-deficit target of 9.3 percent
will be met this year as the better-than-targeted central
government result offsets possible slippage in local
administrations or the social-security system, he told a news
conference in Madrid.  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose four basis points
to 5.57 percent at 11:03 a.m. in London. The difference in
yield, or  spread,  between the securities and benchmark German
bunds rose four basis points to 257 basis points, compared with
a euro-era high of 298 basis points on Nov. 30.  Demand for the Spanish three-month bills was 2.14 times the
amount sold, compared with 2.34 at the last auction, the Bank of
Spain said. The bid-to-cover ratio for the six-month bills was
5.15 times, compared with 2.65 times.  The government is pre-funding for 2011 as this year’s needs
have already been met, Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said on
Nov. 26. Spain’s average cost of financing its outstanding debt
is just over 3.6 percent and the country won’t face refinancing
problems next year, Salgado said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
