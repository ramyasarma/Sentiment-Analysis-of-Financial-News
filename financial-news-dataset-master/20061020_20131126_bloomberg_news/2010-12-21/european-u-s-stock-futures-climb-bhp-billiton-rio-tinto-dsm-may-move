European stocks rose, with the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index  recovering from the slide that followed Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse in 2008, as China said it took
“concrete action” to help limit the sovereign-debt crisis.  Mining companies climbed with commodity prices. Royal DSM
NV jumped more than 3 percent after agreeing to buy U.S.-based
Martek Biosciences Corp. for $1.09 billion. UPM-Kymmene Oyj
rallied 6.8 percent after the company agreed to acquire two
rival papermakers.  The benchmark  Stoxx 600  advanced 1 percent to 281.11 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London, exceeding the 280.41 closing level on
Sept. 12, 2008, the last trading day before the collapse of
Lehman Brothers triggered six months of declines. The gauge has
gained 7.4 percent this month as investors speculated that
Europe’s debt woes will not derail the economic recovery.  “General economic news flow continues to improve and
sovereign-debt concerns are probably priced in,”  Kevin Lilley ,
a fund manager who helps oversee about $2 billion at Royal
London Asset Management, said. “We are also getting mergers and
acquisition activity coming through which is supportive.”  National benchmark indexes rose in all 18 western European
markets except Luxembourg. France’s CAC 40 Index increased 1.1
percent, Germany’s DAX Index gained 0.9 percent and the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 Index advanced 1 percent.  Chinese Help  Chinese Vice Premier  Wang Qishan  said the world’s second-
largest economy has taken “action to help some EU members
counter the sovereign-debt crisis.” China holds a record $2.65
trillion in foreign-exchange reserves.  European stocks continued their rally even after Moody’s
Investors Service said it may cut Portugal’s A1 long-term and
Prime-1 short-term government bond ratings “by a notch or two”
because of the country’s “sluggish” economic growth.  BHP Billiton Ltd., the  world’s largest mining company ,
rallied 2.9 percent to 2,584 pence in London as copper advanced
for a third day. Rio Tinto Group, the third-largest miner,
gained 2.6 percent to 4,537 pence.  Separately, London’s Daily Telegraph newspaper reported
that Rio has increased its offer for Riversdale Mining Ltd. from
A$3.5 billion ($3.5 billion), without saying where it got the
information or how much the miner has offered.  DSM jumped 3.9 percent to 42.60 euros, the highest price
since at least 1989, after the world’s largest vitamin maker
agreed to buy Martek for $31.50 a share in cash to add a U.S.
maker of ingredients for baby food in its biggest takeover in
seven years. The Heerlen, Netherlands-based company said it will
finance the acquisition from its existing cash and will
immediately add to  earnings per share .  UPM-Kymmene, Ingenico  UPM surged 6.8 percent to 12.76 euros after Europe’s
second-biggest papermaker agreed to buy Myllykoski Oyj and Rhein
Papier GmbH for about 900 million euros ($1.2 billion) in total
as the industry consolidates in response to higher production
costs and a shift in demand to digital publications. Norwegian
rival Norske Skogindustrier ASA jumped 4.3 percent to 13.35
kroner.  Ingenico SA soared 5.5 percent to 27.49 euros after board
member and shareholder Allan Green said the sale of the company
has been delayed rather than blocked. The shares fell the most
since May 2009 yesterday after the payment-terminal maker’s
board said a bidder is “not in a position to submit a binding
offer that could be accepted.”  Carnival Plc climbed 3.7 percent to 2,905 pence after the
world’s biggest cruise-line operator forecast that fiscal 2011
earnings will rise as ticket prices strengthen. Miami-based
Carnival predicted full-year earnings of $2.90 to $3.10 a share,
up from $2.47 in fiscal 2010. Analysts had predicted $2.94, the
 average of 28 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Rolls-Royce Group Plc  climbed 2 percent to 650 pence after
Citigroup Inc. raised its recommendation for the world’s second-
largest maker of engines to “buy” from “hold.”  Rival  Safran SA  rose 1.9 percent to 27.43 euros after
Deutsche Bank AG upgraded the Paris-based company to “buy”
from “hold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
