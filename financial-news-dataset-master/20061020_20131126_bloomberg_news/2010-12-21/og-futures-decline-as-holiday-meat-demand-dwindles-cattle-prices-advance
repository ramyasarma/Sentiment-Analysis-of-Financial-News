Cattle futures advanced to a two-
week high and feeder-cattle prices jumped to a record on signs
of climbing beef demand and tight supplies. Hogs declined.  In the U.S., the price of wholesale  choice beef  has gained
15 percent in 2010, and exports of the meat have gained 17
percent in the 10 months ended Oct. 31 from a year earlier,
government data show U.S. The herd on July 1 was the smallest
since at least 1973, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in
a semiannual report on July 23.  “We’ve had very good demand overseas and relatively good
demand domestically for our beef,” said  Lane Broadbent , a vice
president of KIS Futures Inc. in Oklahoma City. “These guys
that are feeding cattle are making a little bit of money. It’s a
supply-driven and a demand-driven market.”  Cattle futures for February delivery advanced 0.575 cent,
or 0.5 percent, to settle at $1.058 a pound at 1:06 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, after touching $1.06275, the
highest for a most-active contract since Dec. 7. The commodity
has climbed 23 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement rose 0.8 cent,
or 0.7 percent, to $1.22975 a pound on the CME, after touching
$1.23375, the highest for a most-active contract since the
commodity started trading on Nov. 30, 1971.  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened mostly on corn until they weigh about 1,200 pounds,
when they are sold to meatpackers.  Higher-Protein Diets  “Domestically, people tend to be on higher-protein diets
when they get into the first part of the year,” Broadbent said.
“Usually, you’ll have a little surge in demand on beef because
we’ve really spent the last month and a half in the turkey and
pork side.”  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.1 cent, or 0.1
percent, to close at 75.975 cents a pound on the CME, the first
drop in three sessions. Futures are up 16 percent this year.  The  price  of wholesale pork fell to a two-week low
yesterday, USDA data show. Most meat processors were “pretty
much” finished buying animals for the week, said  Dick Quiter ,
an account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC in Chicago.  “For meats in general, all the holiday buying is pretty
much done,” Quiter said. “There’s going to be downtime at the
packing plants at the holidays,” he said, citing Christmas and
New Year’s Day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
