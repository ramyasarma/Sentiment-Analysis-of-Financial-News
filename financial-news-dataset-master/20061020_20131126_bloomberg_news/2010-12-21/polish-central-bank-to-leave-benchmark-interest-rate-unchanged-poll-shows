The following is a survey of
forecasts for the Polish central bank’s monthly meeting on
interest rates.  The bank will leave the benchmark  seven-day reference rate 
unchanged at a record-low 3.5 percent, according to 18 out of 19
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg. The last reduction of the rate
was by a quarter-point in June 2009.  The council starts its two-day meeting today and a decision
will be announced at about noon tomorrow, followed by a press
conference at 4 p.m. in Warsaw.  The following is a list of banks predicting the rate won’t
change:  
Credit Agricole CIB in Paris expects a rate increase to 3.75
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
