Corn advanced for a fourth day to
near a six-week high on speculation that demand will climb on
rising ethanol usage in the U.S. and increased purchases by
China. Soybeans and wheat were little changed.  The March-delivery contract rose as much as 0.5 percent to
$6.0250 a bushel in Chicago and traded at $6.0225 by 4:22 p.m.
Tokyo time. The contract reached $6.04 yesterday, the highest
price since Nov. 9.  “Fundamentally, the grain is still strong on increasing
use to produce ethanol and prospects for demand from China,”
said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , the general manager of research at IDO
Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Soybeans for March delivery were little changed at $13.2625
a bushel after trading as low as $13.23 earlier. The price rose
as much as 1.5 percent yesterday to $13.295, the highest level
since Nov. 12.  Congress last week passed an $858 billion tax-cut plan that
includes incentives to help buoy demand for fuel made from crops.
A $1-a-gallon incentive for biodiesel made from vegetable oils,
which expired last year, will be extended for one year. U.S.
ethanol  output  reached a record 939,000 barrels a day in the
week ended Dec. 3, government data show.  The gains in corn and soybeans would be limited as higher
prices may encourage U.S. farmers to sell the crops from
stockpiles and investors to unwind their bets on a price rise
before the Christmas holiday, said  Toshimitsu Kawanabe , an
analyst at commodity broker Central Shoji Co.  Premium Narrows  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
December at Gulf of Mexico ports fell yesterday to 46 cents to
50 cents a bushel above March futures, compared with 49 cents on
Dec. 17, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The premium
for soybeans narrowed to 74 cents to 78 cents a bushel over
January futures, from 74 cents to 82 cents on Dec. 17.  Wheat for March delivery lost as much as 0.6 percent to
$7.65 a bushel and last traded at $7.6875. The price gained as
much as 2.6 percent yesterday.  National Australia Bank Ltd. estimated that “roughly
half” of Australia’s 24 million metric ton wheat crop will be
feed or downgraded quality this season. The cost of the overall
downgrade may approach A$1 billion ($996 million), with losses
from flooding still unclear at this stage, the bank said today.  South Korea will temporarily remove an import tariff on
milling-wheat shipments from Jan. 1 to help “stabilize” local
prices, the nation’s finance ministry said. A tariff on flour
will also be cut to 2.5 percent from 4.2 percent and the moves
will be effective until the end of June, the ministry said in an
e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
