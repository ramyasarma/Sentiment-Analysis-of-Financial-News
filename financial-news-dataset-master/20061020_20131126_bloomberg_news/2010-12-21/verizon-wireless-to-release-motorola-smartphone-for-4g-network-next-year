Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S.
wireless operator, will release a smartphone from  Motorola Inc. 
for its new, high-speed wireless network next year.  The device will be one of the phones and tablet computers
to run on the company’s so-called fourth-generation network,
 Brenda Raney , a spokeswoman, said in an interview today. Verizon
said in October it would introduce a half dozen 4G devices at
the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next month.  Verizon started offering its 4G service, with average
download speeds more than five-times faster than the company’s
3G network, this month. The new technology will cover two-thirds
of the U.S. within 18 months, and put Verizon ahead of its
largest rival  AT&T Inc. , which will introduce its own 4G service
next year.  Sprint Nextel Corp.  unveiled an HTC Corp. phone for
its 4G service earlier this year.  Verizon Communications Inc. , which co-owns the wireless
company with Vodafone Group Plc, rose 20 cents to $34.94 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4 p.m. The stock has
gained 13 percent this year. Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola
gained 12 cents to $9.  Jennifer Erickson , a spokeswoman for Motorola, said the
company plans to introduce 4G devices in 2011, without
specifying which wireless operators would carry them. The Wall
Street Journal reported on the new device for Verizon today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
