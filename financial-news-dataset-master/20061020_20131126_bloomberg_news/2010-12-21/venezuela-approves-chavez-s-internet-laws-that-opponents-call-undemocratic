Venezuela’s congress approved
separate laws last night regulating the internet and
telecommunications as part of a set of new rules opponents have
called undemocratic.  Congress approved the internet bill, article 28 of which
prohibits television, radio or internet messages that “incite,
promote or justify crime, the equivalent of war propaganda,
fomenting anxiety among the citizenry or that alter the public
order,” according to a  statement  published on the National
Assembly website.  Digital media sites responsible for transmitting messages
that fall foul of the laws can be fined up to 13,000 bolivars
($3,023) and service providers that fail to respond to
government inquiries will be fined up to 4 percent of annual
income. Article 5 of the telecommunications law declares such
networks, television broadcasts and radio a “public service,”
according to a  separate statement  on the assembly’s website.  President  Hugo Chavez , who on Dec. 17 was granted decree
powers to pass laws without congressional authorization for the
fourth time since taking office in 1999, is set to raise taxes
and fast-track legislation on housing, urban land and
agriculture. The president says the steps are necessary to
rebuild infrastructure and homes after rains left 35 people dead
and about 130,000 others living in government shelters.  His opponents say that Chavez’s request for decree powers
and the rush to push through “socialist” laws before January
are moves to undermine the new congress, which will have 67
opposition lawmakers out of the total of 165 legislators.  Chavez’s “way of governing is increasingly less democratic
and more like a dictatorship,”  Ramon Guillermo Aveledo , head of
the opposition Democratic Unity Table alliance, said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
