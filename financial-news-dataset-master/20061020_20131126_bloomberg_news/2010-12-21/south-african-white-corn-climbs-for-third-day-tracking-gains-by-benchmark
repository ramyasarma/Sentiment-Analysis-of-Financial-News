White corn in South Africa, the
largest producer of the grain on the continent, advanced for a
third day after prices climbed in the U.S., which competes for
African export markets.  White corn for March delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, rose 4 rand, or 0.3 percent,
to 1,360 rand ($199) a metric ton at the 12 p.m. close in
Johannesburg. Meal made from the grain is the nation’s staple
food. Yellow corn for March delivery fell 1 rand, or less than
0.1 percent, to 1,430 rand a ton. In South Africa the grain is
used mainly as animal feed.  The March-delivery contract rose as much as 0.5 percent to
$6.0250 a bushel in Chicago and traded at $6.0225 by 12:28 p.m.
Johannesburg time. The contract reached $6.04 yesterday, the
highest price since Nov. 9.  Wheat for March delivery fell 1 rand, or less than 0.1
percent, to 2,837 rand a ton.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
