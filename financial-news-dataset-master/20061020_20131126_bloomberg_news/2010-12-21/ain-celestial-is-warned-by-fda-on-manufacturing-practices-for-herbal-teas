Hain Celestial Group Inc.  was warned
by U.S. regulators that it used improper manufacturing practices
at a factory in Boulder, Colorado, that makes Celestial
Seasonings herbal tea.  Inadequate quality-control procedures were among the
violations inspectors found at the plant, the Food and Drug
Administration told the Melville, New York-based company in a
Dec. 3  letter  posted today on the agency’s website. The
inspectors, who visited the plant in March and April, found that
the company also failed to keep adequate records or ensure that
all employees were properly trained, the FDA said.  Six types of Celestial Seasonings tea, classified as
dietary supplements, are “adulterated” because they were made
under conditions that don’t meet the FDA’s “good manufacturing
practice” regulations, the agency said. The company failed to
make sure all equipment was working, and didn’t keep records to
ensure each batch of tea was properly manufactured, packaged and
labeled, according to the letter.  The teas cited in the FDA’s letter were Ginseng Energy,
Detox A.M., Echinacea Complete Care, Sleepytime Extra,
Sleepytime Throat Tamer and Tummy Mint. The teas are among the
company’s “All-Natural Herbal Wellness Blends,” according to
Hain’s  Celestial Seasonings  website.  Tracie Lesser, a spokeswoman for Hain Celestial, didn’t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Hain Celestial declined 39 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $27.78
at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The
stock  climbed  63 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
