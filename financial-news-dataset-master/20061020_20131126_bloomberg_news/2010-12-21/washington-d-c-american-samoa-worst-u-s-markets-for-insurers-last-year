American Samoa and Washington, D.C.,
were the worst U.S. markets for insurers in 2009 as foreclosures
and a tsunami in the South Pacific triggered customer payouts.  Insurers in Washington spent 49 percent more on claims and
other expenses than the $1.6 billion they collected in premiums
last year, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
said today in a report. In American Samoa, a U.S. territory in
the South Pacific, carriers paid out more than 13 times the
$85,000 of premiums they received.  Insurance companies including  Travelers Cos.  and  Allstate
Corp.  seek to limit risks posed by storms and economic downturns
by selling a range of policies in different regions. Mortgage
guarantee contracts, which protect lenders when homeowners fail
to meet loan payments, cost carriers nationwide more than twice
the amount they collected, the NAIC said. In Washington,
mortgage-policy payouts were seven times premiums.  The U.S. Virgin Islands, Hawaii and Puerto Rico were the
most profitable markets in 2009, the NAIC said. Overall,
insurers retained half a cent for every dollar of premium, the
NAIC said. The companies made an additional 5.4 cents on every
premium dollar through investment returns, the NAIC said.  The report included results from property-casualty,
mortgage and financial guarantee businesses. Life insurance was
excluded. In 2008, carriers posted underwriting profits in
Washington and American Samoa, according to the NAIC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
