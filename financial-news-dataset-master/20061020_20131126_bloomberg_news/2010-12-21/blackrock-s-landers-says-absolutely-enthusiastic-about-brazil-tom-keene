Will Landers  said his BlackRock
Latin America Fund is 71 percent overweight in Brazil and he’s
“absolutely” enthusiastic about the country even as the
benchmark Bovespa heads for its worst annual performance ever
versus the MSCI Emerging Market index.  “It’s still one of the cheapest markets in the world,”
said Landers, citing rising consumer spending in Brazil and
gains in commodities prices. “You have a young population
that’s better educated and upwardly mobile,” Landers said in a
Bloomberg television interview today on “Surveillance: Midday”
with  Tom Keene .  The $1.05 billion  BlackRock Latin America Fund  managed by
Landers has returned 13 percent this year, beating a 10 percent
advance in the MSCI Latin America Index. The fund has returned
20 percent in the past five years, more than 90 percent of
competitors. The  Bovespa  is down 0.5 percent this year and slid
6.6 percent from its 2010 peak on Nov. 4, trailing the emerging
market gauge, which is up 14 percent since Jan. 1.  The Bovespa is the only benchmark stock index in the
Americas to fall this year. The underperformance pushed its
price to 13.7 times reported earnings, according to weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg, a 4.5 percent discount to the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  measure of 21 developing nations’ stocks.  Brazil’s benchmark has declined on concern global economic
growth will slow and speculation President-elect  Dilma Rousseff 
may implement economic policies that will quicken inflation.  Economic Growth  In a Nov. 4 telephone interview, Landers predicted the
Bovespa would climb to 90,000 before the end of next year, a 34
percent advance from yesterday’s close, because Brazil stocks
are inexpensive and the economy is expanding. The gauge may
rally to 90,000 sometime in the second half of 2011, Landers
said.  Brazil’s economy will grow 7.5 percent this year and 4.5
percent in 2011, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey.  Brazil has a labor shortage in some industries and needs
“qualified people” for soccer’s World Cup and the Olympics.  The Bovespa gained 1.4 percent to 68,214.86 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo at 3:15 p.m. New York time today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
