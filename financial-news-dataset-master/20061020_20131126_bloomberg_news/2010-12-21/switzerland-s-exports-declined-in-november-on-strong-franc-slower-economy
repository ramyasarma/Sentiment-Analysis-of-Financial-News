Swiss  exports  declined in November
as a stronger franc made goods less competitive abroad and the
economic recovery lost some momentum.  Exports, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation,
dropped 3.4 percent from October, when they rose a revised 2.3
percent, the Federal Customs Office in Bern said in an e-mailed
statement today. Imports fell 3.3 percent from October, when
they increased a revised 1.7 percent. The trade surplus was 1.93
billion Swiss francs, down from 2.05 billion francs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
