Northam Platinum Ltd. , which
operates the world’s deepest mine for metal, said first-half
profit fell as much as 75 percent after a strike in South Africa
reduced production.  Earnings per share for the six months through Dec. 31 are
expected to be between 15 cents and 25 cents, down from 59.9
cents a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today. Safety stoppages and other interruptions led to
lower sales, it said.  A 43-day pay strike at Northam’s only mine cost the company
about 380 million rand ($56 million) in lost revenue, it said on
Oct. 18. The action ended after management agreed to pay rises
of as much as 13 percent, almost four times South Africa’s
inflation rate at the time.  Northam  fell  as much as 72 cents, or 1.6 percent, to 45.28
rand in Johannesburg, and was at 45.65 at the 5 p.m. close of
trading. The company is scheduled to release its interim
 earnings  on Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
