Treasury 10-year yields were near
the lowest level in a week before the Federal Reserve buys
government securities twice today, after two purchases
yesterday.  The central bank is  scheduled  to buy $7 billion to $9
billion of notes due from June 2016 to November 2017 and $1
billion to $2 billion of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
maturing from July 2012 to February 2040. Investors also sought
the relative safety of government securities to protect their
holdings during year-end holidays after military drills in South
Korea yesterday and as a debt crisis in Europe spreads.  “Fed purchases are one of the big factors supporting the
market,” said  Kazuaki Oh’e , a debt salesman in Tokyo at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the North American nation’s
fifth-largest lender. “It’s one of the safest places, and there
are many reasons to buy.”  Benchmark 10-year notes yielded 3.35 percent as of 11:34
a.m. in Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 traded at a price of
93 30/32. The rate dropped to 3.25 percent yesterday, the lowest
since Dec. 10.  Ten-year yields will slide to 2.98 percent by March 31,
according to a Bloomberg survey of banks and securities
companies, with the most recent forecasts given the heaviest
weightings.  Treasuries rose yesterday in Asian trading as South Korea
held artillery drills and the North threatened to retaliate.  Moody’s Investors Service said Dec. 15 it may lower Spain’s
rating, citing “substantial funding requirements,” and it
slashed Ireland’s rank by five levels on Dec. 17. Standard &
Poor’s is reviewing its assessments of Ireland, Portugal and
Greece.  The Fed yesterday bought debt maturing from 2018 to 2020
and from 2014 to 2016, scooping up $14.6 billion in debt, the
biggest amount in a single day under the second round of
quantitative easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
