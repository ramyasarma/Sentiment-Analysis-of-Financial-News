Kenya’s economy, the biggest in East
Africa, grew at its fastest pace in almost three years in the
third quarter as banks boosted loans and power generation
increased.  Gross domestic product rose an annual 6.1 percent after
expanding 5.3 percent in the second quarter, the Nairobi-based
statistics office said in an e-mailed statement today. On a
seasonally adjusted basis, the economy grew 1.3 percent from the
previous three months.  Kenya will probably meet its growth target of as much as 5
percent this year, enabling the central bank to rethink its
monetary policy, the bank said on Nov. 30. The Monetary Policy
Committee left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6
percent at the past two meetings.  Borrowing by consumers increased an annual 20 percent in
the third quarter, while lending to companies climbed 23
percent, the statistics office said. That helped to spur growth
in the financial services industry, which expanded 20.3 percent,
up from 16 percent in the second quarter.  Kenya, the world’s largest producer of black tea, earns
most of its foreign currency earnings from agriculture exports
and tourism. Exports rose an annual 15 percent in the third
quarter, while imports surged 16 percent, the statistics agency
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
