Isuzu Motors Ltd. , Japan’s largest
maker of light-duty trucks, will increase stakes in four
existing joint ventures as it seeks to raise sales and profit in
growing Southeast Asian markets.  Isuzu will raise its stakes to more than 50 percent in
ventures in Indonesia, China, Malaysia and Thailand by the end
of March 2012, President  Susumu Hosoi  said in an interview in
Tokyo yesterday.  “By taking stakes of more than 50 percent, we can control
management of these operations,” Hosoi said.  Southeast Asia is Isuzu’s biggest market, led by Thailand,
where industrywide vehicle sales will rise to at least 800,000
units next year from 750,000 in 2010, Hosoi said. Raising stakes
in the ventures will help Isuzu increase profitability from the
region, which accounts for more than half of its global light
truck sales and 26 percent of total operating profit.  The truckmaker  rose  1.6 percent to 383 yen in Tokyo
yesterday. The stock has risen 121 percent in 2010, the biggest
gainer in the Nikkei 225 Stock Index.  To keep up with demand, Isuzu plans to increase capacity in
Thailand by about 20 percent by 2013, he said.  Isuzu expects its sales in the country to rise 34 percent
to 292,000 units this fiscal year ending in March.  Isuzu currently owns 6.7 percent of its truck venture in
Thailand as well as 50 percent of an engine-making venture in
China. It also has a 44.94 percent share of an Indonesian truck
venture and 20 percent stake in another unit in Malaysia.  China  The Tokyo-based company is gradually increasing capacity to
build truck and sport-utility vehicles in China to about 100,000
units by 2012 from 65,000 units this year. Next year, capacity
will reach 80,000 units, Hosoi said.  Isuzu expects little impact from Thailand’s “eco car
project,” which the company had initially expected would shift
demand of light trucks to passenger cars, Hosoi said.  Under the program, the government offers tax breaks to
automakers and consumers for cars that get at least 20
kilometers per liter (47 mpg). Given growth in overall demand,
especially in rural areas, which are less affected by the
incentives, the demand shift should be less than earlier
expected, Hosoi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
