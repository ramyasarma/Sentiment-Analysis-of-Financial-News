Pretium Resources Inc. , a precious-
metals explorer, rose on its first day of trading after raising
C$265 million ($260 million) in its initial public offering.  The Vancouver-based company advanced to C$6.05 by the 4
p.m. close of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, up 5 cents
from the IPO price of C$6.  The company sold 44.2 million shares in the offering to buy
two northern British Columbia projects, Snowfield and Brucejack,
from Silver Standard Resources Inc.  Pretium, led by Chief Executive Officer  Robert Quartermain ,
was formed to buy and explore precious metals projects. Silver
Standard agreed on Oct. 29 to sell the two projects to Pretium
for C$450 million, which included C$215 million cash and the
rest in Pretium stock.  The company has started planning its 2011 exploration
program “to follow up on the high-grade gold intercepts
encountered in 2009 and 2010 in the Brucejack area,”
Quartermain said today in a statement.  Snowfield and Brucejack are adjoining claims totaling more
than 11,000 acres (4,450 hectares). The property is located 40
miles (64 kilometers) north of Stewart, a town on the edge of
the Alaskan panhandle, according to an October report on the
site by Wardrop Engineering Inc. that was commissioned by
Pretium.  The $3.47 billion Snowfield-Brucejack open-pit mine is to
have a 27-year life, the Wardrop report said.  Snowfield-Brucejack Projects  “The Snowfield deposit is a near-surface, low-grade, bulk-
tonnage, porphyry-style gold deposit that has the additional
potential of copper-gold and molybdenum,” the report said.
Brucejack’s “ores are dominated primarily by precious metals
(gold, silver), but some deposits may also contain variable
amounts of base metals such as copper, lead and zinc.”  The operating cost for the project is estimated at C$10.20
per metric ton milled and it will employ 617 workers. A pretax
financial model shows a 12.4 percent internal rate of return, a
5.3-year payback on the $3.47 billion in capital spending and a
net present value of $2.3 billion at a 5 percent discount rate.  Production is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of
2018, according to the Wardrop report. The next stage is a pre-
feasibility study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
