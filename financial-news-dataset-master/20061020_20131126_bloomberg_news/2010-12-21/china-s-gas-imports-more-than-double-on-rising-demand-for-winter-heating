China more than doubled imports of
natural gas last month because of increased demand for heating
during winter, the nation’s top economic planner said.  Purchases jumped 150 percent from a year earlier to 1.9
billion cubic meters, the National Development and Reform
Commission said on its  website  today, without giving comparative
figures. Imports gained 17 percent from October, it said.  The country has increased gas production and imports to
meet rising demand in winter since last month, according to the
commission. Beijing’s gas demand surged fourfold to 770 million
cubic meters from a month earlier, it said.  China’s gas consumption gained 13 percent to 10.2 billion
cubic meters in November from a month earlier, according to the
statement.  Overseas purchases of the cleaner-burning fuel climbed 130
percent to 15.3 billion cubic meters in the first 11 months of
the year. Consumption from January through November gained 21
percent to 96.9 billion cubic meters. China imports natural gas
via a pipeline from Turkmenistan and also in the form of
 liquefied natural gas  cargoes.  China’s oil-product consumption rose 15 percent to 20.07
million metric tons in November from a year earlier, the
National Development and Reform Commission  said  in another
statement on its website today.  Fuel demand gained 11 percent to 210 million tons in the
first 11 months, it said. A diesel shortage in the nation is
“gradually easing” and inventories of the fuel are rising,
according to the commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
