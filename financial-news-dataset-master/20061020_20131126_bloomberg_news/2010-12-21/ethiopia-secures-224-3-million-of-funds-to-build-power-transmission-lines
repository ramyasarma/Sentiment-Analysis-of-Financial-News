Ethiopia secured $224.3 million from
the African Development Bank to fund the construction of four
electricity transmission lines to improve its own power supply
and help development in neighboring countries, the lender said.  Additional transmission capacity is “critical and timely”
for Ethiopia’s industrial development, said Lamin Barrow, the
AFDB’s resident representative, by phone today from the capital,
Addis Ababa. The lines will connect areas in the north, east and
south-west of the country, and help expedite plans to export
power to Sudan and Kenya, he said.  Under a five-year plan, Ethiopia, which suffers from
intermittent blackouts, plans to quadruple power generation to
at least 8,000 megawatts and expand electricity coverage to 75
percent of the population from 41 percent now. A lack of
transmission lines is hindering attempts to export power, the
state-owned Ethiopian Electric Power Corp. said on Dec. 8.  The Tunis-based African Development Bank will lend Ethiopia
61 percent of the funds and donate the rest, Barrow said.  The project, which will see 948 kilometers (589 miles) of
230-volt cables laid, is scheduled to finish in Aug. 2013,
Barrow said. Eight new sub-stations will be built and another 11
upgraded under the plan, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
