CarMax Inc. , the largest U.S. seller
of used cars, declined the most in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index after expenses and inventories climbed.  CarMax  fell  $2.73, or 7.6 percent, to $33.17 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares, which
fell earlier as much as 10.3 percent, declined the most since
June 2009.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
14 percent from a year earlier to $219.7 million, CarMax said
today in a statement. The Richmond, Virginia-based company also
ended the quarter with “significantly higher” inventory, Chief
Financial Officer  Thomas Reedy  said on a conference call.  “SG&A should’ve been lower than where it came in, probably
by about $5 million or so,” said  Matt Nemer , a San Francisco-
based analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, who rates the shares
“overweight” and doesn’t own them. “People are concerned that
SG&A is going to start to be a headwind.”  Chief Executive Officer  Tom Folliard  has announced plans to
open three stores this fiscal year and five more in fiscal 2012.  “Investors are fearful that next year, growth in expenses
could get somewhat out of control,” said John Tomlinson, an
analyst at ITG Investment Research in New York, which doesn’t
give ratings on companies it covers.  CarMax’s inventory, which rose 34 percent from a year
earlier to more than 1 million units, also probably “spooked
people,” Tomlinson said. “There could be margin pressure in
coming quarters if sales are slow.”  Net income for the quarter rose to $82.4 million, or 36
cents a share, from $74.6 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier,
CarMax said. The average estimate of 15  analysts surveyed  by
Bloomberg was for a profit of 34 cents. Sales rose 23 percent to
$2.12 billion.  CarMax shares rose 48 percent this year through yesterday
as used vehicle prices have rebounded to the highest in 15
years, according to Manheim Consulting. The group’s  Used Vehicle
Value Index  climbed to 124.3 for November, the highest since the
index began in 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
