A suspicious device discovered on a
Rome subway train today wasn’t capable of exploding, Mayor
 Gianni Alemanno  said.  A package was found under a seat in an empty car on a
service track at the Rebibbia station on Rome’s B subway line at
about 10 a.m. local time, the city’s ATAC metro service said in
an e-mailed statement.  “After further checks it was determined that the device
wasn’t capable of exploding because of its rudimentary nature,”
Alemanno said in an e-mailed statement. “I can guarantee after
checks at all metro stations that there are no further risks.”  The station was cordoned off as police officers
investigated the device, news agency Ansa said. Alemanno
previously said that the discovery was “worrying.”  Subway service hasn’t been halted in Italy’s capital and
trains are running regularly, an ATAC spokesman said.  Rome was the site of violent protests by students Dec. 14
as Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  won a confidence
vote. The students opposed the government’s plan to overhaul the
country’s university system.  Last week a suspected terrorist bomber killed himself and
injured two other people in separate explosions near a central
shopping street in Stockholm.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
