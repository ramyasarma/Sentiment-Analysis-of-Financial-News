             Liverpool’s Fernando Torres will be
out of action for up to three weeks with an injury sustained
while helping Spain win the World Cup final, his club said.  
 The striker sustained the thigh-muscle injury after coming
on as a substitute in the 1-0 victory over the Netherlands in
Johannesburg. Liverpool hosts Arsenal in its first Premier
League game of next season on Aug. 15.  
 “The initial assessment was he had a mild adductor tear
and the Spanish medical staff didn’t consider it to be too
serious at the time,” Peter Brukner, Liverpool’s head of sports
science and medicine, told the club website. “He had an MRI
scan yesterday which confirmed a small tear.”  
 Torres should be able to resume training in two to three
weeks and be able to play again within three to four weeks,
Brukner said.  
 Earlier today, the Spanish soccer federation said the tear
was classified as grade 1, the least serious.
