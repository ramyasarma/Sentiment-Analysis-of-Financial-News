             Early treatment for HIV cuts
patients’ risk of death by about 75 percent, according to a
study in the  New England Journal of Medicine .  
 Researchers tested two groups of 408 adults with HIV, the
AIDS-causing virus. Among patients given antiviral drugs after
their infection-fighting cells fell below a certain level, 23
people died, exceeding the 6 deaths in the group whose
participants were provided earlier treatment, the study showed.  
 The results support findings in a previous study of medical
records published last year. The latest trial also shows early
antiretroviral treatment reduces the likelihood of tuberculosis,
a leading cause of death among HIV patients, by 50 percent.  
 “Access to antiretroviral therapy should be expanded,”
researchers including Daniel W. Fitzgerald at Weill Cornell
Medical College in New York wrote in the study.  
 In the latest trial, conducted in Haiti from 2005 to 2008,
patients were given drugs based on their level of a white blood
cell type known as CD4+. All participants had a CD4+ count of
more than 200 and less than 350 per cubic millimeter of blood.  
 The World Health Organization  recommends  patients start
antiretroviral therapy when their CD4+ count drops to 350. A
higher CD4+ count means greater infection-fighting ability
because the immune system hasn’t yet been depressed by the
virus.  
 The early-treatment group began taking a combination of
zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz within two weeks after
enrollment, the researchers said. Patients in the standard-
treatment group were given the therapy when their CD4+ count
fell to 200 or when AIDS developed.  
 $200 Per Year  
 The antiretroviral drugs cost about $200 per person
annually, according to the study.  
 Zidovudine and lamivudine are sold as Combivir by a
subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline Plc, while Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. sells efavirenz as Sustiva.  
 Truvada and Atripla, respectively a two- and three-drug
combination, are the world’s biggest-selling AIDS medicines and
are made by Foster City, California-based  Gilead Sciences Inc.   
 A previous study, published in the same journal in April
2009, reviewed 17,000 HIV patient records and found that people
who received treatment at earlier stages of infection reduced
the risk of early death by as much as 94 percent.  
 Tuberculosis is the leading infectious killer of HIV
patients and accounts for about 13 percent of AIDS deaths
globally, the United Nations AIDS agency said on its  website .
