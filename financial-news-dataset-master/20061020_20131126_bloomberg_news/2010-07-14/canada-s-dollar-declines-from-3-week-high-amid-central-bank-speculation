             Canada’s dollar pared losses as
oil rose and U.S. equities reversed an earlier decline, raising
the allure of higher-yielding assets and currencies of countries
that depend on gains in commodities for growth.  
 The currency was the third-best performer among the
greenback’s 16 most-traded counterparts last week, rising 2.8
percent on speculation higher borrowing costs weren’t fully
reflected in the exchange rate. Crude oil rose to a two-week
high after a U.S. government report showed that inventories
declined three times as much as expected last week. Oil is
Canada’s biggest export.  
 “There is modest risk appetite coming back with stocks and
oil up and continuing speculation that the Bank of Canada will
raise rates next week,” said  Michael Gregory,  a senior
economist in Toronto at Bank of Montreal, the nation’s fourth
largest lender. “There is enough momentum in the economy to
keep things humming along for now.”  
 The Canadian currency was little changed at C$1.0309 per
U.S. dollar at 12:20 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0300 yesterday,
when it touched C$1.0277, the strongest level since June 23. One
Canadian dollar buys 97 U.S. cents.  
 The Bank of Canada next meets July 20 to determine  interest
rates  after a report showed last week that employers added
93,200 jobs in June, about five times as many as the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Policy makers
lifted the target lending rate on June 1 to 0.5 percent and said
future moves would depend on the pace of growth in Canada
weighed against signs of an uneven global recovery.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2 percent today.
