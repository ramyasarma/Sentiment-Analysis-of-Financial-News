             Stayton SW Assisted Living, the
senior living provider formerly known as Sunwest Management
Inc., won court approval of its reorganization plan that sells
assets in a transaction valued at $1.3 billion.  
 U.S. District Judge  Michael Hogan  in Eugene, Oregon,
approved the company’s restructuring proposal yesterday after
finding that the plan was feasible and provided the maximum
value to the estate’s creditors, according to a company
statement today.  
 Under the Oregon-based company’s plan, a joint venture of
Blackstone Real Estate Advisors VI LP, Emeritus Senior Living
and Columbia Pacific Advisors will buy 149 senior living
facilities for about $1.3 billion including cash, securities and
debt, according to the statement. Existing Sunwest investors
have the choice of receiving cash or securities in the new
company.  
 “I’m very pleased,” Chief Restructuring Officer  Clyde Hamstreet  said in the statement. “Now, we can focus our
attention on closing the Blackstone transaction.”  
 That sale should be ready to close by Aug. 1, Hamstreet
said.  
 The non-senior living assets, including apartments, office
buildings and undeveloped land, will be put into a new entity
that will be run by Sunwest’s receiver and liquidated, according
to the statement. The proceeds will be distributed to the
estate’s creditors and investors, the company said.
