             Wheat rose to a six-month high on
signs that output will be less than expected in exporting
countries near the Baltic Sea, boosting demand for supplies from
the U.S., the world’s largest shipper.  
 Ukraine lowered its grain-output forecast by 6.7 percent to
42 million metric tons after rains delayed harvests and eroded
crop quality, Interfax reported today. Researcher SovEcon said
last week that Russia’s worst drought in at least a decade may
reduce the country’s wheat production by 21 percent.  
 Reduced supplies from the Baltic will mean “some higher
demand” for U.S. wheat, said  Jon Marcus , the president of
Lakefront Futures and Options LLC in Chicago. “That’s the only
thing that’s bullish right now.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery advanced 9.75 cents,
or 1.8 percent, to $5.59 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after touching $5.66, the highest price for a most-active
contract since Jan. 12. Wheat has jumped 16 percent in July,
partly as hot weather hurt crops in Russia and France while
excessive moisture threatened grain in Canada.  
 U.S. exports may improve as importers seek alternative
supplies, said  Alexander Bos , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.
in London.  
 The world’s biggest shippers of wheat are the U.S., Canada,
Australia, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
