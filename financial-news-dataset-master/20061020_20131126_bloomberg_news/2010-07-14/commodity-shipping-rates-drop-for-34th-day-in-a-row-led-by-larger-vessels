             The  Baltic Dry Index , a measure of
commodity-shipping costs, fell for the 34th consecutive day, the
longest decline in almost nine years, as rates plunged to hire
larger iron ore carriers.  
 Rents for capesize ships that haul iron ore to make steel
fell 17 percent, the most since October 2008. Steel prices in
China, the biggest iron-ore consumer, are likely to drop 10
percent for the rest of the year, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a
note on July 12. Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., the biggest publicly
traded steelmaker in China, cut steel prices for a second month.  
 “Iron ore buying has really fallen off,”  Peter Norfolk ,
research director at Freight Investor Services Ltd. in London,
said by phone today. A “rapid increase in steel production has
led to oversupply. It’s not taken long for increased steel
output to overrun demand.”  
 The Baltic Dry Index of rates on international trade routes
fell 81 points, or 4.5 percent, to 1,709 points, according to
the London-based Baltic Exchange. Rates have dropped everyday
starting May 27, the longest retreat since Aug. 15, 2001.  
 Chinese  prices  for 25 millimeter (1 inch) rebar, a steel
product used to reinforce concrete, have fallen 2.6 percent this
month while iron-ore stockpiles rose 4.8 percent, according to
data from Antaike Information Development Co.  
 This year the three biggest iron ore miners, Vale SA, Rio
Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd., moved away from a 40-year
custom of pricing supplies annually by signing quarterly
contracts. Material is selling under contract at $145 to $150 a
metric ton in the current three-month period, according to
Arctic Securities ASA. That compares to a spot  price  of $117.60.  
 Delaying Purchases  
 Chinese buyers may be delaying purchases in anticipation of
lower contract prices in the fourth quarter, Norfolk said.  
 Capesize rents fell to $12,278 a day, the lowest since
January 2009. Operating expenses for the vessels, once financing
is taken out, are about $7,000 a day, according to Guy Campbell,
head of dry-bulk at London-based  Clarkson Plc , the world’s
biggest shipbroker.  
 Daily rates for smaller panamaxes, which compete for coal
and iron-ore cargoes and also transport grains, gained 1.7
percent to $15,941. Supramaxes, used for  fell 2.5 percent and
 handysizes  lost 1.6 percent, according to the exchange.
