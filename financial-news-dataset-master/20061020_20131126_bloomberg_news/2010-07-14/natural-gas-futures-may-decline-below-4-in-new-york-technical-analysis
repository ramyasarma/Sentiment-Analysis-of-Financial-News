             Natural gas may fall below $4 per
million British thermal units if the August contract breaks
below a key supporting level, according to a technical analysis
by  Chris Kostas , a senior analyst at Energy Security Analysis
Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts.  
 A break below the August contract’s all-time low of $4.07
per million Btu, reached on May 6, will send the futures below
$4 before it expires on July 28, and gas futures will approach
$3 by September, according to Kostas.  
 “It’s going to spell trouble for the bears if we break
into a new contract low and we can go down to the lower $3”
range, said Kostas. “It’ll be bearish for the August contract,
the September contract and the October one.”  
 Natural gas for August delivery fell 3.4 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $4.354 per million Btu yesterday on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 The futures have declined in six of the past seven days and
are down 12 percent from a month ago even as forecasts showing
above-normal temperatures in the U.S. signaled stronger demand
from power plants.  
 “It’s supposed to be hot and the trend is still bullish,”
said Kostas. “But if it doesn’t hold we could move lower.”
