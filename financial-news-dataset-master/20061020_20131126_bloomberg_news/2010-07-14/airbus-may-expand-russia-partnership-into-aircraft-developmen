             Airbus SAS , the world’s largest
planemaker, said it may expand its partnership in Russia by
jointly developing a future aircraft, not the 150-seat jet now
planned by a Russian state-controlled company.  
 It will take time to move beyond an existing alliance in
Russia that creates freighters from A320 single-aisle passenger
planes, Airbus Chief Executive  Tom Enders  said yesterday in an
interview in Yekaterinburg. Russia’s  OAO Irkut Corp.  will
develop the MC-21 on its own, Enders said.  
 “We have always said this is a long-haul strategy,” he
said. “We start small then we go to bigger projects like the
freighter conversion. And then maybe, some day, we will be able
to also develop aircraft together.”  
 Irkut has said it intends to develop a 150-seater that
would challenge Airbus’s own single-aisle A320 as well as Boeing
Co.’s 737 series. The plane is in a preliminary design phase and
management will give further details about planned development
at the Farnborough International Airshow next week.  
 “Russian colleagues have already decided on the MC-21,”
Enders said. “I think the development has started. We don’t see
a replacement of our very successful single-aisle family A320
family for the next 15 years or so.”  
 Enders was in Yekaterinburg, a city in Russia’s Ural
Mountain region, as part of a delegation with German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel.   
 Enders said Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, is seeing
signs of a nascent recovery in the commercial aircraft business
following a recession in 2009.  
 “We saw signs of it at the Berlin air show” in June, he
said, and he is “cautiously optimistic” that the recovery will
be evident at Farnborough.  
 Airbus is owned by European Aeronautic, Defense & Space Co.
