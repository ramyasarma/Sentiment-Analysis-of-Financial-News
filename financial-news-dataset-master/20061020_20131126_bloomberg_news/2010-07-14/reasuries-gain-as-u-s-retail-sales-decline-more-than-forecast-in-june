             The Treasury’s $13 billion sale of
30-year bonds may draw a yield of 4.108 percent, according to
the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the
Federal Reserve’s 18 primary dealers.  
 The auction is the second reopening of the $16 billion 30-
year debt sale on May 13, and the securities mature in May 2040.
They yielded 4.094 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due
by 1 p.m. New York time.  
 The last sale of 30-year securities, on June 10, drew a
yield of 4.182 percent.  
 The bid-to-cover ratio at last month’s offering, which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount sold,
was 2.87. The average ratio for the past 10 sales is 2.61.  
 Indirect bidders, the class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 36 percent of the securities at
the June sale. At the May offering, they purchased 32.5 percent.
The average for the past 10 sales is 36.4 percent.  
 Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors who place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 20.3 percent of
the last sale, less than the May auction’s 21.8 percent. The
average for the past 10 offerings is 15.6 percent.  
 The 30-year bond was reintroduced in February 2006 after
the government suspended it in 2001.  
 The debt has outperformed other U.S. government securities
this year, returning 12 percent to investors, compared with a
5.3 percent gain for the broader Treasury market, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  
 The Fed’s primary dealers trade government securities with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions. The government sold $21 billion in 10-year notes
yesterday and $35 billion of 3-year debt on July 12.
