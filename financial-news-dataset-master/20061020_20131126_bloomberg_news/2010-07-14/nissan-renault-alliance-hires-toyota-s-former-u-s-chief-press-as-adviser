             The Renault SA- Nissan Motor Co. 
alliance has hired  Jim Press , former head of Toyota Motor
Corp.’s U.S. unit, as a consultant for the group’s global sales
and marketing.  
 Press, 63, who most recently was Chrysler LLC’s vice
chairman and president, has worked for Renault-Nissan for about
four months, said  Simon Sproule , a spokesman for the alliance.  
 “He’s visited with our dealers in the States, Europe and
Japan and has already begun providing substantial input,”
Sproule said by phone today.  
 Toyota in 2007 named Press to its board of directors, the
first such appointment of a non-Japanese executive. He left the
company later that year to join Chrysler.
