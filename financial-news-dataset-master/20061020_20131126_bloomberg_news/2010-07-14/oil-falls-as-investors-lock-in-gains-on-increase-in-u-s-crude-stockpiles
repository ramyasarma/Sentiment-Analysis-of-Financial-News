             Crude oil fell in New York as
investors sold contracts to lock in price gains after an
industry report showed an increase in U.S. inventories. Oil for
August delivery declined as much as 33 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$76.82 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
