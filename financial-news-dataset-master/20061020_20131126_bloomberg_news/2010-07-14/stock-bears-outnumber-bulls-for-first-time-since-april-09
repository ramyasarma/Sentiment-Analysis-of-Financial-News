             The level of bullish sentiment about
the U.S. stock  market  fell below the level of bearishness for
the first time since April 2009, according to a survey of
newsletter writers.  
 The proportion of bullish publications tracked by  Investors 
Intelligence trailed bearish ones by 2.2 percentage points,
declining to 32.6 percent, the lowest level since March 2009.
Individuals’ optimism about equities also fell to its lowest
level since March 2009, 21 percent, according to a survey last
week by the American Association of Individual Investors. The
Standard and Poor’s 500 Index has  rallied 7 percent  from July 2
through yesterday.  
 Some analysts regard investor sentiment as a contrarian
indicator and believe increased pessimism is a sign the market
is poised to rebound.  Barton Biggs , the hedge-fund manager who
was among the first investors to turn bullish at the start of
the bull market in 2009, said July 2 that he slashed his equity
holdings in half that week. The S&P 500 has rallied every day
since then.  
 “It swings a little too much to one side, and we have a
rally,”  Peter Boockvar , an equity strategist at Miller Tabak &
Co.in New York, said in an interview.  
 The Investor Intelligence survey is typically a lagging
indicator, said  Michael Burke , co-editor at New Rochelle, NY-
based Investors Intelligence.  
 “Probably next week people will get a little more
bullish,” he said in an interview. “We’re in the earnings
season now, and that’ll make people a little more optimistic.”  
 The following are results from Investors Intelligence’s
analysis of investment newsletters for July 7 through yesterday.
