             Oil traded near its highest level in
two weeks in New York before a report forecast to show that
crude inventories declined last week in the U.S., the world’s
largest energy user.  
 Futures pared losses of 0.4 percent as European equity
 markets  advanced for a seventh day and the U.S. dollar gave up
earlier gains versus the euro. The Energy Department will
probably report that inventories fell 1.5 million barrels last
week, a Bloomberg News survey of 14 analysts shows.  
 “While fundamentals in Europe and the U.S. remain
problematic, the oil price in the last 24 hours has defied
gravity,” said  Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Bache
Commodities Ltd. in London. “The steady stock market and
continued belief in strong growth in emerging economies are both
helping.  
 Oil for August delivery traded for $77.11 a barrel, 4 cents
lower in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
as of 8:51 a.m. London time, having dropped as much as 34 cents
to $76.81 a barrel. Yesterday, the contract jumped $2.20, or 2.9
percent, to $77.15, the highest level since June 28. Brent crude
for August settlement was 2 cents higher at $76.67 on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
