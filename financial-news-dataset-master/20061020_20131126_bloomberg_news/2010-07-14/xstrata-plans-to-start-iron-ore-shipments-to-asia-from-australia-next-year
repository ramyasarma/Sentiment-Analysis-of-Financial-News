             (Corrects to remove reference to percentage of iron in
concentrate in second paragraph of story moved on July 14.)  
 Xstrata Plc, the world’s biggest
thermal coal exporter, plans to start its first shipments of
iron ore concentrate from Australia to Asia during the first
half next year.  
 The project, part of the $542 million underground expansion
of the Ernest Henry copper mine in Queensland state, is
targeting production of 1.2 million metric tons of magnetite
concentrate a year, Zug, Switzerland-based Xstrata said in an
emailed statement.  
 “The magnetite concentrate will be sent by rail from
Cloncurry to Townsville,” Xstrata said in the statement, making
it the first iron ore concentrate producer in Queensland. “We
expect first shipments to Asia from the Townsville port in the
first half of 2011.”  
 Xstrata this month resumed work on the Ernest Henry
expansion after the Australian government amended a planned mine
tax. The Ernest Henry underground mineral resource contained 72
million tons of probable reserve at 1 percent copper and 22
percent magnetite, Xstrata said in a December statement.
