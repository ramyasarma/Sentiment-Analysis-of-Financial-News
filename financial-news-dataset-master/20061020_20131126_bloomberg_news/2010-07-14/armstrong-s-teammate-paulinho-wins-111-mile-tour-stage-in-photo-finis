             Portugal’s Sergio Paulinho of the
RadioShack team won stage 10 of the Tour de France, beating
Vasil Kiryienka in a photo finish.  
 Luxembourg’s  Andy Schleck  kept the race-leading yellow
jersey, retaining a 41-second lead over the defending champion
 Alberto Contador . Both finished in the same pack of riders at
the end of the 111-mile stage between Chambery and Gap.  
 Paulinho, a teammate of seven-time champion  Lance Armstrong , broke free of the leading six-man group with about 10
miles left although he was chased down by Belarus’s Vasil
Kiryienka of the Caisse d’Epargne team.  
 With less than a mile left, the Portuguese darted out in
front and just held off a late charge by Kiryienka.  
 The stage over rolling terrain included a category 1 and
category 2 climb, the second and third-most difficult. Many of
the riders stayed bunched together during the stage and finished
some 14 minutes behind Paulinho.  
 Schleck wrested the lead from two-time runnerup Cadel
Evans, who lost more than eight minutes on a mountain climb
yesterday. Armstrong remains in 31st place, 17 minutes behind.
The Tour ends July 25 in Paris.
