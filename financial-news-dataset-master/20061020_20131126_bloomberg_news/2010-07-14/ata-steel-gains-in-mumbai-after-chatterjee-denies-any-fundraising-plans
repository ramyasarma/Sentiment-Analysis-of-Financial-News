             Tata Steel Ltd., India’s biggest
producer, rose in Mumbai trading after Chief Financial Officer
Koushik Chatterjee said the company doesn’t plan to raise funds.
The shares gained as much as 2.1 percent to 519.40 rupees and
traded at 515.95 rupees, up 1.4 percent, as of 9:04 a.m. in
Mumbai. The benchmark Sensitive Index rose 0.8 percent.  
 “I can tell you we are not looking to raise funds at the
moment,” Chatterjee said today in a phone interview, denying a
Financial Chronicle report.  
 The company will raise $2 billion by issuing fresh equity
in the coming three months to finance its expansion projects in
India and abroad, the Financial Chronicle reported, citing a
banker it didn’t identify. The money will be raised in three
parts and the company is in the process of finalizing a lead
arranger for the offering, the report said.
