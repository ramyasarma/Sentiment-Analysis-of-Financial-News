             John Malone , the billionaire
chairman of  Liberty Media Corp. , said he’s invested a portion of
his family’s fortune in the currencies of Australia, Canada and
Norway amid concern that the long-term value of the U.S. dollar
may decline.  
 Malone, 69, whose net worth was valued at $2.4 billion by
Forbes in March, said he’s more comfortable with the monetary
and fiscal discipline of those countries compared with the U.S.,
in an interview in Denver broadcast today with Bloomberg
Television’s “In the Loop with  Betty Liu .”  
 “Although the dollar has come back, those currencies have
still held pretty well,” Malone said.  
 The Australian dollar has climbed about 11 percent against
the U.S. dollar over the past year, while the Canadian dollar
has gained 9.5 percent and the Norwegian krone has risen 3.7
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Malone said he’s become more conservative in protecting his
assets. “I used to carry a meaningful amount of personal debt.
I am now quite liquid.”  
 Malone said he’s avoiding investing in gold. “I’m not a
gold bug. There’s just something about gold that seems
artificial to me,” he said.  
 “The vast bulk of my wealth is still in U.S. equities and
companies that I’ve founded or I am still a major investor in,”
Malone said. “I feel good about the companies. I’m worried
about the macro environment.”  
 Liberty, based in Englewood, Colorado, has controlling
interests in the Starz Entertainment cable networks, global
cable systems and the QVC shopping channel.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  has rebounded from a 10-
month low on July 2, paring its decline year-to-date to 2.1
percent. It has risen 21 percent in the past year.
