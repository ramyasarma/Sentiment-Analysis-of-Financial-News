             The U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission, citing 153 deaths in the past four years, voted to
ban drop-side cribs in the agency’s first across-the-board
overhaul of regulations for infant beds in almost three decades.  
 “We’ve seen a number of tragedies because we had such a
weak crib standard,” CPSC Chairman  Inez Tenenbaum  said today as
the agency voted 5-0 to approve  a notice of proposed rulemaking .
The agency was following a mandate from Congress, she said.  
 A spate of company recalls involving more than 9 million
drop-side cribs over five years led the government to warn
parents in May to stop using the products because of suffocation
and strangling risks. The new rules would ban the sale of new
and used drop-side cribs and prohibit their use in hotels, day-
care centers and other commercial facilities.  
 “The proposed rule is a very strong standard that will
address all aspects of crib construction and provide an
effective margin of safety,” Commissioner  Nancy Nord , the
CPSC’s senior Republican, said in a statement. “I do have a
concern, however, about the effective date and that the
retroactive nature of the” rule may have consequences.  
 “We certainly do not want to create a situation where
people stop using cribs and place their babies to sleep in
unsafe environments,” Nord said.

 Regulators will review public comments before making the
rules final by the end of the year, Tenenbaum said. The agency
last approved a comprehensive crib standard in 1982, she said.  
 Drop-side cribs have been popular because one side can be
raised or lowered on tracks, providing parents with easier
access to the bed. Infants can suffocate or be strangled when
the hardware fails and a side detaches, creating a gap.  
 Other crib hazards involve added soft bedding, insufficient
mattress support and broken slats. The agency has documented 153
crib deaths since Nov. 1, 2007, including 65 suffocations.  
 Williams-Sonoma Inc. ’s Pottery Barn Kids business today
 recalled  82,000 of the cribs for hardware than can break. The
CPSC said it received 36 reports that the cribs’ drop-sides
malfunctioned or detached, resulting in seven minor injuries.
The cribs were sold from January 1999 through March 2010.  
 LaJobi Inc., owned by  Kid Brands Inc. ; Bexco Enterprises
Inc.’s Million Dollar Baby unit; Jardine Enterprise Ltd.;
Simmons Juvenile Products, and Child Craft Industries Inc.
recalled drop-side cribs in June.  
 The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, which has
started a crib-safety initiative, is offering consumer
information on its  website . There’s a list of manufacturers and
downloadable guides to safe sleep on the site, the CPSC said.
