             A sale by  Northrop Grumman Corp.  of
its shipbuilding unit to General Dynamics Corp. would trigger
competition concerns, the U.S. Defense Department said.  
 The two companies are the military’s main shipbuilders.  
 “If that number were reduced, that would be problematic
for us,”  Geoff Morrell , the Defense Department’s spokesman,
said in an interview yesterday. “In that context, it’s of
interest and a potential concern.”  
 Northrop Chief Executive Officer  Wes Bush  said this week
that the Los Angeles-based company will shut its yard in
Avondale, Louisiana, by 2013, move work to Mississippi, and seek
to spin off or sell its entire shipbuilding unit.  
 General Dynamics, based in Falls Church, Virginia, runs
three yards: Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine; Electric Boat in
Groton, Connecticut, and Nassco in San Diego. Northrop’s yards
are in Avondale; Pascagoula, Mississippi and Newport News,
Virginia.  
 If Northrop sells its ship unit to a company other than
General Dynamics, the Pentagon’s concerns would be “largely
alleviated,” Morrell said.  
 General Dynamics spokesman  Rob Doolittle  said he couldn’t
immediately comment.  
 ‘Watching Closely’  
 “We will be watching closely to see what they decide to
do,” Morrell said.  
 Northrop, the third-largest U.S. defense contractor, fell
54 cents to $56.45 at 10:47 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. General Dynamics declined 75 cents to $60.86.
Northrop’s shares had gained 2 percent this year before today,
compared with a 9.6 percent drop for General Dynamics, the
Navy’s second-largest shipbuilder by sales.  
 Lockheed Martin Corp.  is the world’s biggest defense
contractor.  
 Northrop executives said yesterday that the company has
interested parties and may take several quarters to decide on
the unit’s future. The plan to consider options, after nine
years of expansion, is part of a strategic review of its
businesses, including military aircraft, missile technology and
defense electronics.  
 A spinoff is the primary focus, Bush said.  
 The ship division may be worth as much as $4.6 billion in a
sale at an average industry multiple, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg. Shrinking naval orders may be a factor driving the
move, said  Jon Kutler , chief executive officer at Admiralty
Partners, a Los Angeles-based private-equity firm specializing
in aerospace and defense.  
 Avondale will close after work on LPD-17 class Navy
transport ships wraps up in 2013, and operations will be moved
to Pascagoula to reduce costs and increase  efficiency , Bush
said. The company also will shut two smaller Louisiana yards in
Tallulah and Waggaman, he said.
