             France striker  Thierry Henry  joined
the New York Red Bulls from Barcelona, the Major League Soccer
team said today on its  website .  
 He’ll make his U.S. debut against English Premier League
club Tottenham, north London rival of his former club Arsenal,
in a July 22 warmup match at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New
Jersey. He joins on a “multiyear contract,” the team said.
Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  
 The 32-year-old has played for Barcelona, Arsenal, Juventus
and Monaco. His 51 goals are a record for the French national
team, for which he’s played 123 times including in the 1998
World Cup-winning side and the 2000 European champion team. He
was the top scorer in the Premier League four times.  
 “I’m a competitor and I don’t like to lose,” Henry said
on the Red Bulls’ website. “I just want to win and try to do
everything in my power to win the game.”  
 Henry is the latest big-name European veteran to sign with
an MLS club. The most prominent has been  David Beckham , the
former English national team captain, who joined the Los Angeles
Galaxy in 2007.  
 “Thierry is not only a world-class player who will
undoubtedly improve our squad, but he has shown most importantly
throughout his career that he is a winner,” said Erik Soler,
general manager and sporting director of the Red Bulls. “He has
made it clear to us that he is committed in the short and long
term to help in our vision of making our organization the
premium franchise in Major League Soccer.”  
 Henry will hold a press conference tomorrow at Red Bull
Arena.
