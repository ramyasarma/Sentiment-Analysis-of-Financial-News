             BaWang International (Group) Holding
Ltd. said a report that two of the company’s products contain a
substance that may cause cancer was “inaccurate and
unfounded,” according to a statement today to the Hong Kong
stock exchange.  
 “The directors of the Company are of the view that the
Group’s products do not pose any health or safety issues to the
users,” the statement said. “All products of the Company
comply with the stringent requirements of the current legal and
regulatory manufacturing standards in China and have passed all
related quality control tests,” it said.  
 Samples of BaWang’s anti hair-loss formula shampoo and its
Royal Wind brand endorsed by Chinese pop singer Faye Wong had 10
parts per million of 1,4-dioxane, a substance that may cause
cancer, Next Magazine reported, citing test results by Hong
Kong-based inspection and analysis company SGS.  
 The company is seeking advice on what actions it may take
against the publisher of the magazine, it said. Shares of the
company will resume trading July 15, it said.
