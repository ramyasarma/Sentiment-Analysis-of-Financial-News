             Honda Motor Co. , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker, plans to open a new hybrid plant by 2013 while
scrapping plans to build a mini-vehicle factory, Nikkei English
News reported.  
 Honda will resume construction of the hybrid plant in
Saitama prefecture north of Tokyo, which had been suspended,
Nikkei reported, without saying where it got the information.
The automaker has decided to drop plans “entirely” for a 50
billion yen ($567 million) minivehicle plant in Yokkaichi, Mie
prefecture, the report said.  
 Yasuko Matsuura , a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based
carmaker, declined to confirm or deny the report.  
 Honda  fell  1.7 percent to 2,694 yen as of 9:30 a.m. in
Tokyo trading, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
declined 1.1 percent.  
 The carmaker’s decision to cancel the minicar factory also
means it won’t develop new commercial minivehicles, Nikkei
reported.
