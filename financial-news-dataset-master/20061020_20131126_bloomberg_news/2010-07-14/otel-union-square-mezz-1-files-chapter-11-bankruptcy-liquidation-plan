             Hotels Union Square Mezz 1 LLC and
Hotels Union Square Mezz 2 filed a joint liquidation plan today
that would wind up the bankruptcy cases relating to the  W New
York  Union Square hotel.  
 The New York hotel, which features  Rande Gerber’s  Underbar,
is operated by a unit of White Plains,  New York-based Starwood
Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. , the third-largest U.S. lodging
company. Under the terms of the plan, W Hotel Management Inc.
will continue to manage the hotel under its existing agreement.  
 Hotels Union Square Mezz 1 was put into bankruptcy in March
by junior mezzanine lender LEM that took over ownership of the
Manhattan luxury property in December from  Dubai World .  
 LEM, an affiliate of Lubert-Adler Real Estate Funds, paid
$2 million at a foreclosure auction on Dec. 8 to assume the debt
on two mezzanine notes as well as the mortgage payments on the
hotel after Dubai World defaulted.  
 The case is Hotels Union Square Mezz 1 LLC, 10-10971, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
