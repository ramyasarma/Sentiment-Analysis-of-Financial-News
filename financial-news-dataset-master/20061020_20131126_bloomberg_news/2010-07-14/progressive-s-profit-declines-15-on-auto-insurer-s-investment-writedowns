             Progressive Corp. , the fourth-
largest U.S. auto insurer, said profit fell 15 percent on
investment writedowns.  
 Second-quarter  net income  dropped to $211.9 million, or 32
cents a share, from $250.1 million, or 37 cents, in the year-
earlier period, the Mayfield Village, Ohio-based company said
today in a statement. Operating income, which excludes
investment losses, was about 36 cents a share, matching the
average  estimate  of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The insurer had its main operating subsidiaries downgraded
by Standard & Poor’s on June 10 on the possibility that
investments will falter. The units were cut to AA from AA+ on
“vulnerability to earnings volatility” from investments.  
 “Progressive tends to have a modestly more aggressive
investment portfolio,” said  Paul Newsome , an analyst with
Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in Chicago. “They have a little
more equity exposure than is typical for public companies. With
the financial markets where they were, that meant more
impairment charges” in the three months ended June 30.  
 Progressive had an investment loss of $39.5 million before
taxes in the three months ended June 30 compared with a $15.9
million investment gain in the year-earlier period. The stock
portfolio had a 5.7 percent decline in June while fixed-income
holdings added 0.6 percent.  
 Book Value  
 The insurer has been adding highly rated securities such as
Treasuries to limit writedowns after the decline of more
volatile holdings cost $1.45 billion before taxes in 2008. Book
value per share, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose to
$9.44 from $9.26 as of March 31.  
 The insurer climbed 27 cents to $20.11 at 4:02 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Progressive has advanced
12 percent this year, beating the 8.3 percent gain in the 24-
company  KBW Insurance Index.

 Premium revenue increased 4.3 percent to $3.59 billion from
$3.44 billion in the year-earlier period. Progressive’s total
personal auto insurance policies rose to 7.97 million from 7.81
million in March, led by a 15 percent increase in the number of
customers who signed up through direct channels including the
Internet or mail.  
 The insurer had an underwriting profit margin of 7.3 cents
on every dollar it collected in premiums for the quarter,
compared with a 7.4 cent margin in last year’s second quarter.  
 “Underwriting was a little better than I expected,” said
Newsome. Outside of the investment portfolio, “results looked
pretty good.”  
 Allstate, Geico  
 Progressive is seeking to gain market share as it competes
against  Allstate Corp.  and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s  Geico Corp.
selling coverage to individuals. Chief Executive Officer  Glenn Renwick  is adding customers through the Internet and attracting
clients who own motorcycles, mobile homes and boats.  
 Claims costs for Progressive rose 3.5 percent in the six
months ended June 30 to $4.97 billion. Travel on U.S. roads in
April rose 1.2 percent from the year-earlier month to 255.9
billion miles, according to the  Federal Highway Administration .
The agency has not yet reported results for May and June. More
miles driven may result in a higher frequency of claims for auto
insurers.
