             The construction of new offshore
wind parks in Germany may be delayed as a government agency
refuses to grant building permits because of environmental
concerns,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing an
internal document.  
 The  Bundesamt for Naturschutz , an agency for the protection
of the environment, said construction work on the foundations
for the windmills is driving porpoises from their natural
habitat and is harming crustaceans and other marine life, FTD
reported.  
 Companies specializing in offshore wind parks may now face
higher costs as licensing processes become more complex and
investments are jeopardized, FTD said.
