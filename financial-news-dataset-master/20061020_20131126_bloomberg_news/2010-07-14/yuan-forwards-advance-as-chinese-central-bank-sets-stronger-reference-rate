             Yuan forwards strengthened after the
central bank set the reference rate stronger, spurring
speculation the authorities will permit more appreciation.  
 The People’s Bank of China set the so-called central parity
rate 0.07 percent higher at 6.7755 per dollar, following the
biggest decrease in two weeks yesterday. Most of Asia’s
emerging-market currencies rose against the greenback today
after a bond sale by Greece eased concern Europe’s debt crisis
will derail a global recovery.  
 “It’s a mixture of a weaker dollar, better risk appetite
and the steady lowering of the yuan fixing,” said  Emmanuel Ng ,
a currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in
Singapore. “Currently, the spot’s year-to-date annualized
appreciation is running at about 1.5 percent. We expect room for
it to run towards 2 percent.”  
 Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.13 percent
to 6.6583 per dollar as of 5:54 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting
bets the currency will gain 1.7 percent from the spot rate of
6.7745, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 China’s overseas  sales  jumped 43.9 percent in June from a
year earlier to $137.4 billion, the customs bureau said July 10.
The trade surplus more than doubled to an eight-month high of
$20 billion.  
 Ng said the yuan’s spot rate may appreciate to 6.6915 by
the end of this year. The currency, which is allowed to trade up
to 0.5 percent either side of the reference rate, has climbed
0.8 percent since China ended a two-year-old peg on June 19.  
 Bonds Advance  
 Government bonds gained for a third day after the finance
ministry sold one-year notes at a lower yield than analysts
forecast.  
 The ministry sold 30.01 billion ($4.4 billion) of debt due
in a year at an average yield of 1.87 percent, six basis points
less than the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 China’s June  inflation  rate was 2.9 percent, the 21st
Century Business Herald reported today, citing market rumors.
That would compare with 3.1 percent in the previous month.
Growth in industrial production may have slowed to 13.6 percent
from 18.5 percent, according to the newspaper.  
 The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures lending costs
between banks, slid for a sixth day, the funding center data
showed. The rate declined 19 basis points to 1.8 percent, the
lowest level since May 20.  
 “June figures won’t look good, and slower economic outlook
would further drive down bond yields,” said  Hu Hangyu , a
Beijing-based analyst with Citic Securities Co., China’s biggest
listed brokerage. “A previous funds shortage has eased a lot
with the repurchase rate sliding.”  
 The yield on the 2.83 percent government note due in May
2017 fell two basis points to 2.78 percent, and the price of the
security added 0.12 per 100 yuan face amount to 100.30,
according to the National Interbank Funding Center. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.
