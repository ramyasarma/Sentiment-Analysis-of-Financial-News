             Canada will spend C$2.6 billion
($2.5 billion) to build two supply ships for its navy, Defense
Minister  Peter MacKay  said.  
 The ships will be built in Canada and the country may buy a
third, MacKay told reporters today in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The
vessels will supply fuel, ammunition, spare parts, food and
water and serve as a base for helicopters.  
 The investment is part of Canada’s  shipbuilding program 
under which two shipyards, chosen through a competitive process,
will build the large ships. Other shipyards will build smaller
vessels, according to the program’s  website .
