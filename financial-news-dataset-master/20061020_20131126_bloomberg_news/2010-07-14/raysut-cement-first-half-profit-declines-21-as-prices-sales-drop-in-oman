             Raysut Cement Co. , the biggest Omani
cement maker by market value, posted a 28 percent drop in
second-quarter profit as sales and prices fell after competition
from companies in the United Arab Emirates. The shares fell to
the lowest in more than a year.  
 Net income declined to 6.84 million rials ($18 million)
from 9.46 million rials in the year-earlier period, according to
Bloomberg  calculations  based on first-half figures provided by
the company today. That was above the 6 million-rial forecast by
EFG-Hermes Holding SAE and United Securities.  
 “The inflow of cement from U.A.E. and the price
competition in the northern market in Oman, as well as the
demand recession in the export segment have impacted the volume
of sales and revenue,” Raysut Chairman  Mohammed Bin Alawi Ali Muqaibal  said in a statement. The supply of cement from the
U.A.E. will continue affecting prices although demand is likely
to rise because of new infrastructure projects, it said.  
 First-half profit was 13.6 million rials compared with 17.3
million rials in the year-earlier period, according to the
 statement to  the Muscat bourse. Sales dropped 27 percent to 36
million rials in the period.  
 Raysut shares  fell 3 percent to 1.32 rials, the lowest
since June last year, in Muscat today. The stock has lost 11.5
percent this year, compared with a 2.4 percent drop
in the benchmark  MSM 30 Index .
