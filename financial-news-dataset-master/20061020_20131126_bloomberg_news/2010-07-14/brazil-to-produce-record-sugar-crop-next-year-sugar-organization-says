             Sugar production in Brazil and
India, the top two producers, looks promising in the year
starting October, with a possible record crop from South
America, the International Sugar Organization said today.  
 Brazil, the largest grower, may have a record crop of about
41 million metric tons in the 2010-2011 year, compared with 36
million tons in the current year, Peter Baron, ISO’s executive
director, said in an interview in Indonesia.  
 India may produce about 26 million tons next year and
export about 500,000 tons, Baron said.  
 Production in China will probably increase by 20 percent to
15 million tons, Baron said. Still, the country may need to
import as much as 2 million tons next season, he said.  
 “We may start to see price pressure in October, but it’s
not a dramatic pressure,” Baron said before the 16th Asia
International Sugar Conference that starts in Bali, Indonesia
tomorrow.
