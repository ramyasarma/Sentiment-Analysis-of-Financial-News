             Crude oil in New York must challenge
resistance around $80 a barrel to move higher, or test support
at $72.50, to break out of its range, according to technical
analysisJ1ZD1DRGLXRK"></a>Oil for September delivery, which will become the front-
month contract on July 21, is stuck in a $72.50-to-$80 range,
said  Veronique Lashinski , a senior research analyst for Newedge
USA LLC in Chicago. To move higher the contract will have to
challenge resistance near the $80 level that was reached between
June 16 and 28.  
 Crude oil for September delivery touched $80.82 a barrel on
June 21 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
intraday level since May 14. The contract rose $2.15, or 2.9
percent, to $77.59 yesterday. West Texas Intermediate oil is the
benchmark grade used by the Nymex.  
 “Despite today’s strong price action, WTI is still trading
within its recent range,” Lashinski said in an interview.  
 The next target would be $80.90, the upper end of a “broad
cloud,” Lashinski said. A so-called cloud, or Ichimoku chart,
analyzes the mid-points of historic highs and lows. Technical
analysts study past trading patterns and prices to forecast
market changes.  
 The contract will have to break through support in the
$72.50 area to move lower, Lashinski said. September oil settled
at $72.51 on July 6, the lowest level since May 25.
