             Australia’s federal Cabinet has
agreed to a climate change policy, including a commitment to set
an interim carbon price it will implement to reduce carbon
emissions over the next two years, the Australian Financial
Review reported without saying where it got the information.  
 The government will seek to build a consensus with the
business community on a short-term, market-based mechanism, with
a consultative process to review its emissions trading plan
after 2012 also planned, the newspaper said.
