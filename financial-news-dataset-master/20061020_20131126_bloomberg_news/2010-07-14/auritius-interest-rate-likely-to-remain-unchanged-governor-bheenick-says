             Mauritius’s central bank said it
will probably leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a
sixth consecutive meeting as it monitors the impact of the
European debt crisis on its economy.  
 “We think it’s broadly appropriate where we have it now,”
central bank Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said in an interview
in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi today. “If there had been no
euro crisis it could be different, but now it’s quite
complicated with our exports and tourism affected.”  
 The central bank last reduced the benchmark rate by 1
percentage point in March 2009. Europe is the leading trade
partner of Mauritius, an island about 500 miles (805 kilometers)
off the east coast of Madagascar that earns most of its foreign
currency from tourism and exports of sugar, clothing and
textiles.  
 The Bank of Mauritius left the repo rate at 5.75 percent at
its last rate-setting meeting, it said on June 22. The bank last
cut the rate by 1 percentage point in March 2009. Policymakers
at Mauritius’s central bank typically meet to decide on the key
interest rate about four times a year, according to its website.
