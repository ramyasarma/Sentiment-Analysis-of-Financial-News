             More than 80 officers were injured
in three nights of rioting in Belfast, Northern Ireland  police 
said.  
 At least 82 officers were hurt July 11-12 and an unknown
number were injured last night, a spokeswoman for the Police
Service of Northern Ireland said by phone today.  
 Police were attacked with gasoline bombs, bricks and other
missiles in nationalist areas of Belfast. The worst violence was
in Ardoyne, a Catholic district in north Belfast. Police used
water cannons and batons to respond to the attacks, which
involved hundreds of persons.  
 Disturbances began July 11 on the eve of the peak of the
pro-British Protestant marching season. The July 12 marches
commemorate a Protestant victory over Catholics in 1690 and
nationalist residents in Ardoyne protested that one of the
marches passed through their district. The violence spiraled
began after police removed the protesters from the road the
parade was scheduled to pass through.  
 Dissident republicans, opposed to Northern Ireland’s U.K.
link, were blamed by local politicians for organizing the
violence, which also broke out in Derry in the north-west of the
province, and Lurgan in county Armagh.
