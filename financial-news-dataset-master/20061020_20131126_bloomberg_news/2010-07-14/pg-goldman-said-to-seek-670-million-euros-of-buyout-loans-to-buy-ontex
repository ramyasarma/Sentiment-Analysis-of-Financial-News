             TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.’s buyout arm are seeking to raise at least 670 million
euros ($851.7 million) of financing to back their bid to buy
Belgian diaper maker  Ontex NV , three people familiar with the
situation said.  
 Lenders including Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs
are working on loans, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private.  
 Candover Investments Plc, a London-based private equity
firm, has been seeking at least 1.2 billion euros to sell
Ontex for a year, according to people with knowledge of the
situation. The company’s cash flow rose 59 percent to 150.3
million euros in 2009, according to its website.  
 Sophie Bullock , a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs, and a spokesman for TPG in London declined to comment.  
 Candover acquired Zele, Belgium-based Ontex in 2003. After
raw material and transport costs climbed, the company was forced
to sell assets in 2007 to pay down debt, restructuring 700
million euros of senior and mezzanine loans.
