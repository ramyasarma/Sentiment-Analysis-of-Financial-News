             U.S. Steel Corp. , the country’s
second-largest steelmaker, said workers were injured in an
explosion and fire at a Pennsylvania coke plant.  
 The cause of the explosion today at one of the nine
batteries at the Clairton plant is unknown pending an
investigation,  Erin DiPietro , a spokeswoman for Pittsburgh-based
U.S. Steel, said today in an e-mailed statement. An undetermined
number of workers were taken to local hospitals with unspecified
injuries, she said.  
 The  plant , located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of
Pittsburgh, is the largest coke manufacturing plant in the
country with annual production capacity of 4.7 million tons,
U.S. Steel said on its website. The effect of the blast on the
plant’s operations will be assessed later, DiPietro said. Coke
is a coal derivative used to make steel.  
 Fifteen workers were injured, including 14 with burns,
after a coke oven exploded around 9:30 a.m. local time, the
Associated Press reported, citing an Allegheny County spokesman.
At least three people were critically injured, AP said.  
 U.S. Steel rose 71 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $43.30 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The shares 
have declined 21 percent this year.  
 Nucor Corp. , based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is the
largest U.S. steelmaker by 2009 sales.
