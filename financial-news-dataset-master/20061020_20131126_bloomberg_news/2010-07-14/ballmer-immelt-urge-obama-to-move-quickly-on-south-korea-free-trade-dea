             Chief executive officers of
 Microsoft Corp. , General Electric Co.,  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  and
other large U.S. companies urged President  Barack Obama  to move
quickly on his pledge to pass a free-trade agreement with South
Korea.  
 “Decisive and quick progress on the Korea agreement is
especially vital given that the European Union and Korea have
signed their own trade pact which, once implemented, will put
U.S. companies and their workers at an even greater
disadvantage,” the executives wrote in a letter to Obama today.  
 The letter was signed by Microsoft’s  Steve Ballmer , Jeffrey
Immelt of GE, Wal-Mart’s  Michael Duke  and nine other chief
executives. The pending agreement with South Korea, which was
signed in 2007, is opposed by unions and  Ford Motor Co. , which
argues that the Asian nation keeps unfair technical barriers to
its exports while enjoying free access to the U.S. market.  
 The executives said the administration’s vow to make
progress on automobile and beef exports to Korea should “be
accomplished quickly and take into account the fact that
progress on each of these issues has already been made.”  
 The Obama administration vowed to alter the pact’s auto
provisions in order to address the concerns of Ford, the unions,
and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman  Sander Levin , a
Michigan Democrat.  
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce  estimates  that failure to
enact the accord with the world’s 14th-largest economy means the
loss of $35 billion in exports and 345,000 jobs. South Korea
signed a rival agreement with the European Union last year that
calls for 99 percent of commerce to be duty-free within five
years. That deal is awaiting ratification.  
 The trade negotiations have security implications and are a
sign of U.S. commitment to South Korea as a critical strategic
ally in Asia. Tensions in the region remain elevated after an
international panel last month blamed North Korea for sinking
the South Korean warship Cheonan in March.  
 Obama is aiming to wrap up efforts on the pact in time for
a summit of the Group of 20 leaders in Korea in November.
