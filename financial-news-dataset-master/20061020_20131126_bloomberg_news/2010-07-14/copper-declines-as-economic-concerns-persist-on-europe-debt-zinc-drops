             Copper declined as concerns about
the strength of the global economic recovery persist. Zinc fell.  
 Copper for three-month delivery lost 0.3 percent to $6,665
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 3:00 p.m. in
Shanghai. Zinc dropped 1 percent to $1,845.75 a ton.  
 Portugal had its credit rating reduced two levels to A1 at
Moody’s Investors Service yesterday on prospects for weak
economic growth and a growing debt burden. Copper, used in
construction and home appliances, has dropped 9.4 percent this
year on signs that growing budget deficits from Greece to Spain
may slow the global economic recovery.  
 “Euro-zone issues are not over yet,” Lu Chenghong, a
trader at Hong Kong Sancharm Investment & Trading Co., said from
Shanghai today. “We don’t see an up reason for metal prices
unless China’s demand shows solid signs of improvement after the
summer lull.”  
 Copper for October delivery rose as much as 1.7 percent to
53,200 yuan ($7,854) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange and
closed at 52,910 yuan. Zinc added as much as 2 percent to 15,160
yuan a ton and closed at 15,105 yuan a ton.  
 China’s State Council Information Office will hold a
briefing on the nation’s first-half economic performance in
Beijing tomorrow. Statistics may show China’s economic expansion
slowed in the second quarter, compared with the first three
months of the year.  
 Wait and See  
 “Open interest dwindled as investors chose to wait and see
how the wind blows on the day,” Liu Jia, an analyst at Jinrui
Futures Co., said from Shenzhen today. Open interest refers to
the combined number of buy and sell positions held by traders.  
 Nickel in London was unchanged at $19,550 a ton at 3:02 p.m.
in Shanghai. The nickel market may swing to a greater deficit
than expected this year because of supply disruptions and
greater Chinese demand, said Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., the
biggest producer in Japan.  
 World demand may exceed supply by 40,000 metric tons this
year, up from the company’s forecast in April of 36,000 tons,
 Toru Higo , general manager of the Tokyo-based company’s nickel
sales and raw material department, said. This would be the first
deficit since 2006, he said.  
 Lead in London fell 0.6 percent to $1,814 a ton, aluminum
added 0.2 percent to $1,998.25 a ton, while tin lost 0.6 percent
to $17,900 a ton at 3:03 p.m. in Shanghai.
