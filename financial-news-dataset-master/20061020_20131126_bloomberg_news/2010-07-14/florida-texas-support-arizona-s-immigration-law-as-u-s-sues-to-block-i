             Florida, Texas and seven other
states filed a brief supporting Arizona’s immigration law aimed
at cracking down on illegal migrants after the U.S. government
sued to block enforcement of the law.  
 Arizona’s statute doesn’t establish an immigration policy
that would interfere with federal law, countering the U.S.
argument, the states said in the filing today in federal court
in Phoenix. The law isn’t an “obstacle” to Congress’
objectives, the states wrote.  
 “The federal government seeks to negate this pre-existing
power of the states to verify a person’s immigration status and
similarly seeks to reject the assistance that the states can
lawfully provide to the federal government,” the states wrote
in the filing.  
 The U.S. sued July 6, arguing that under the Constitution
immigration is a matter for federal policy only. The lawsuit
seeks an injunction barring Arizona from enforcing the law,
which is set to take effect July 29.  
 The states, in their filing, asked U.S. District Judge
 Susan Bolton  to reject the U.S. injunction request. Bolton
scheduled a hearing in the case for July 22.  
 Representatives of the U.S. Justice Department didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.  
 Police Requirements  
 The Arizona law makes it a state crime to be in the U.S.
illegally. The statute requires local police officers who come
in contact with someone for law enforcement reasons to check the
individual’s immigration status if they suspect the person lacks
proper documentation.  
 Alabama, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
South Dakota and Virginia, plus the territory of the Mariana
Islands, also joined in today’s brief supporting Arizona.  
 The U.S. lawsuit followed court challenges by the  American
Civil Liberties Union  and an Arizona police officer who doesn’t
want to enforce the statute. Challengers to the law claim it
will hinder law enforcement efforts, making people less likely
to attend community meetings or come forward to report crimes
out of concern that their appearance or accent may cause police
to question their citizenship.  
 Arizona Governor  Jan Brewer , who signed the law, has said
current U.S. policies have resulted in the state being “under
attack” from Mexican drug and immigrant-smuggling cartels.  
 The case is United States of America v. State of Arizona,
2:10-cv-01413, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona
(Phoenix).
