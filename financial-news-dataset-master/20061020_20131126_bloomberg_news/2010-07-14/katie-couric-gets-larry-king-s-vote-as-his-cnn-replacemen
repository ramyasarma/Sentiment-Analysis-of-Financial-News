             Larry King  says “CBS Evening News”
anchor  Katie Couric  is the best choice to succeed him as host of
a prime-time CNN talk show.  
 “Katie has experience; she’s a good interviewer,” King
said today. “She has a magic name. All things being equal, she
would have a big edge.”  
 King, who announced on June 29 that his last show will be
Nov. 19, said in an interview he has no role in picking his
replacement. Couric, who left NBC’s “Today” show in 2006 for
CBS, hasn’t said she is interested. Her contract with New York-
based  CBS Corp.  expires in 2011.  
 Couric’s spokesman,  Matthew Hiltzik , said she is reporting
from the Gulf Coast, is enjoying her job and will leave the
speculation to everyone else.  
 “Katie has the utmost respect for Larry and his
contributions have been invaluable,” Hiltzik said.  
 Alan Berger , Couric’s agent, has said she doesn’t want the
job, according to King. Hiltzik, speaking for Berger, said the
comments were “lighthearted” and Berger meant to convey “that
no one could replace Larry King.”  
 CNN, owned by  Time Warner Inc. , is seeking permission from
NBC to talk to  Piers Morgan , the “America’s Got Talent” judge,
about taking over for the 76-year-old King, according to two
people with knowledge of the discussions.  
 Barbara Levin , a spokeswoman for CNN, declined to comment.  
 King said he doesn’t know Morgan beyond interviewing him on
his show. The 25-year CNN veteran has “a rooting interest” for
“American Idol” host and radio DJ  Ryan Seacrest , whom he
describes as a friend.  
 “What I don’t know is whether Ryan is political,” King
said.  
 King also said he doesn’t expect CNN to dramatically alter
its straight news format to air shows that are more partisan in
tone, regardless of who is chosen to succeed him.  
 “I hope that they won’t,” King said. “They say that they
won’t. CNN is a brand.”
