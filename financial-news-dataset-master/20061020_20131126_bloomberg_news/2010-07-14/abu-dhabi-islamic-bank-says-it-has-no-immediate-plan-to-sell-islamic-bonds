             Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC , the
United Arab Emirates’ second-biggest bank complying with Islamic
banking rules, said it has updated its Islamic bond or sukuk
program and has no immediate plans to sell bonds.  
 “We will monitor the market and may look into issuance on
an opportunistic basis,” Abu Dhabi Islamic said in an e-mailed
response to questions from Bloomberg News late yesterday.  
 State-controlled Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank plans to raise as
much as $5 billion from the sale of sukuk under a trust
certificate program, according to a  base prospectus  dated July 8
posted by the bank on the London Stock Exchange’s website
yesterday. The bonds will be issued from “time to time” in any
currency, the prospectus said. HSBC Holdings Plc is the lead
arranger of the bond program, according to the prospectus.
