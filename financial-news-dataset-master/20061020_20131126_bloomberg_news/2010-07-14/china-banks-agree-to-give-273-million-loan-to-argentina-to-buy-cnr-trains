             China Citic Bank Corp. and China
Development Bank Corp. agreed to lend Argentina’s Ministry of
Economy and Public Finance $273 million to help the country buy
high-speed trains from  China CNR Corp.   
 CNR plans to export 20 high-speed trains and 220 passenger
cars to Argentina and provide support services and parts, China
Citic Bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 The agreement on the 10-year loan was reached yesterday
during a visit to Beijing by Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner . Other deals included a $150 million
credit line between  China Development Bank  and the National Bank
of Argentina.  
 China, which has the world’s second-biggest railway network
after the U.S., is exporting its rail technology overseas. The
country’s rail ministry has said it plans to expand the national
network to 120,000 kilometers (74,500 miles) of track by 2020
from 86,000 kilometers at the end of last year.
