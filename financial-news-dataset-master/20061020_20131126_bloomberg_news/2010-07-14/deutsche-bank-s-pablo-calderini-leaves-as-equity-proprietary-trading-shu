             Deutsche Bank AG ’s  Pablo Calderini ,
the head of equity proprietary trading, is leaving to join a
hedge fund as Germany’s biggest bank winds down the business for
buying and selling stocks with its own money.  
 Calderini, 46, has been with Deutsche Bank for about 14
years and helped establish the company’s emerging-markets
business, according to an internal memo confirmed by spokesman
 Michael Golden . No replacement will be named for New York-based
Calderini because the remaining equity proprietary unit will be
folded into the regular equity flow business.  
 Anshu Jain , the head of Deutsche Bank’s corporate and
investment bank, cut capital available for equity proprietary
trading by 90 percent and closed the credit proprietary trading
desk after the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. The U.S. government is close to introducing the
biggest rewrite of Wall Street rules since the 1930s including
limits on potentially risky activities like proprietary trading.  
 “The switch to a hedge fund is logical because proprietary
trading is being increasingly regulated at banks,” said  Andreas Plaesier , a Hamburg-based financial analyst at M.M. Warburg.
“Equity prop trading was relatively volatile at Deutsche Bank
so it has turned the focus to flow trading.”  
 Investment Plans  
 Jain, 47, reorganized the equities unit after losses in
2008 and the business posted the best result since 2007 in the
first quarter of this year, helped by profitable equity
proprietary trading. Deutsche Bank plans to spend about
1.6 billion euros ($2 billion) on hiring and technology for the
global markets unit in the next two years to break into the top
five in U.S. cash equities and commodities.  
 “Pablo has led the development of a number of cornerstone
businesses in our sales and trading platform,” Jain said in the
memo. “Most recently Pablo led our equity propriety trading
business, including its successful transformation since the
crisis to a highly liquid, less capital intensive strategy.”  
 Separately, Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank said today it
hired  Dixit Joshi  of  Barclays Capital  as head of equities for
Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The firm yesterday named
 Jeffrey Mayer , who previously worked at  UBS AG  and Bear Stearns,
as head of global markets for North America.
