             German stocks  gained for a seventh
day as Infineon Technologies AG advanced after Intel Corp.
reported earnings that topped estimates, offsetting declines by
carmakers.  
 Infineon  rose 2.4 percent, the highest close in more than
three weeks. Gildemeister AG advanced after Equinet AG lifted
its recommendation on the stock. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and
 Daimler AG  led declines. Biotest AG and CTS Eventim AG both
dropped by more than 7 percent.  
 The  DAX Index  rose 0.3 percent to 6,209.76 in Frankfurt,
having earlier risen as much as 0.6 percent and declined as much
as 0.5 percent. The gauge has climbed 8.7 percent following the
European Union’s May 10 unveiling of a 750 billion-euro ($921
billion) loan package aimed at stopping the euro region’s
weakest members from defaulting. The broader  HDAX Index  also
gained 0.3 percent.  
 “With Intel’s results, the technology sector has started
strongly into the quarterly earnings season and will inspire not
only the competition like Infineon, but the entire market,”
said  Stefan Risse , strategist at CMC Markets in Frankfurt.  
 Infineon, Europe’s second-biggest chipmaker, gained 2.4
percent to 5.31 euros. Intel, the world’s largest, said third-
quarter sales will be $11.6 billion, plus or minus $400 million.
Analysts had estimated $10.9 billion on average, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  
 Allianz SE increased 1.8 percent to 87.15 euros after
Credit Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation for Germany’s
biggest insurer to “outperform” from “neutral.”  
 Gildemeister Climbs  
 Gildemeister AG  gained 3.7 percent to 10.60 euros. The
German cutting-tool maker founded in 1870 was raised to “buy”
from “reduce” at Equinet AG, which said “demand should pick
up strongly in coming quarters.”  
 BMW and  Daimler , the world’s biggest makers of luxury cars,
lost 1.4 percent to 41.55 euros and 0.6 percent to 43.55 euros,
respectively. European carmakers fell 0.7 percent today after
posting the best performance among 19 industry groups in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index yesterday when  BMW  lifted its earnings
projections.  
 CTS Winning Streak Ends  
 CTS Eventim sank 7.6 percent to 39.10 euros, ending its
longest winning streak in a year. The ticketing company was
downgraded to “underperform” from “outperform” at Credit
Agricole Cheuvreux.  
 Biotest  slumped 12 percent to 29 euros, the stock’s biggest
drop since 2002. First-half earnings before interest and taxes
fell to 23.7 million euros from 31.2 million euros, the company
said, citing a “further downturn in the prices for plasma
proteins.” Revenue increased 4 percent, Biotest said.  
 A report today showed European inflation slowed in June and
industrial production increased less than economists forecast in
May as the economy struggled to gather strength.  
 Consumer prices in the 16-member euro region rose 1.4
percent from a year ago after increasing 1.6 percent in May, the
European Union statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Industrial production rose 0.9 percent in May from the previous
month, a separate report showed today. Economists forecast
output to rise 1.2 percent, the median of 27 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey showed.
