             Argentina’s President Cristina
Fernandez de Kirchner failed to convince China’s President Hu
Jintao to end a ban on Argentine soybean oil imports, newspaper
Clarin  reported , without saying how it obtained the information.  
 The presidents agreed yesterday in a meeting in Beijing to
form a committee to study problems in the countries’ bilateral
relationship, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper reported today.  
 China’s Agricultural Minister Sun Zhengcai promised his
Argentine counterpart, Julian Dominguez, that he will visit the
South American country in September with “all the problems
solved,” the newspaper said.  
 China in April banned soybean oil shipments from Argentina,
which supplied about 75 percent of total imports until then.
