             The rand pared earlier losses versus
the dollar after South African retail sales in May rose 4.6
percent, more than the 3.7 percent median estimate of nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest economy traded 0.2 percent
weaker at 7.5469 as of 11:33 a.m. in Johannesburg. Before the
data were released, the rand depreciated as much as 0.5 percent.
