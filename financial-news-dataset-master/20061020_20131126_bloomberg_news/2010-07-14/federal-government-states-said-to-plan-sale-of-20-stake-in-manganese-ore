nation’s largest producer of the ore, a government official with
direct knowledge of the matter said.  
 The federal government will sell a 10 percent stake, and
the governments of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh will sell 5
percent each, the official said, declining to be identified as
the proposal hasn’t yet been approved by the cabinet. The
federal government intends to invite investment banks as early
as today to compete to manage the share sale, the person said.
