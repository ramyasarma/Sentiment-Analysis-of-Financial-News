             BYD Co. , the Chinese maker of cars
and rechargeable batteries backed by  Warren Buffett , may delay
an A-share listing in China to seek “better timing” for the
sale after stock markets fell.  
 BYD’s  board of directors  requested a 12-month extension
until Sept. 7, 2011, to prepare a listing, the Shenzhen-based
company said in a  statement  to Hong Kong’s stock exchange today.
Shareholders will vote on the proposal at an Aug. 30 meeting.  
 The request comes after BYD’s Hong Kong-listed shares
 declined  more than 30 percent from their highest level this year
on April 7. The company, founded by chairman  Wang Chuanfu , said
in July 2009 it plans to sell as many as 100 million Class A
shares in Shenzhen and use the proceeds to develop its auto and
rechargeable-batteries businesses.  
 “The domestic and global stock markets are not performing
well, so we would like to have enough time to choose a better
timing for the share sale,” Paul Lin, a spokesman for  BYD , said
by phone today.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, has slumped 25 percent this year on
concern government efforts to curb inflation and property
speculation will slow the economy.  
 BYD  rose  1.4 percent to close at HK$55.15 today in Hong
Kong trading, trimming its decline this year to 19 percent. The
 stock  has jumped fivefold since the company raised HK$1.4
billion ($180 million) selling shares for HK$10.95 each in an
initial public offering in Hong Kong in July 2002.  
 ‘Missed Best Timing’  
 The company aims to raise 2.85 billion yuan ($421 million)
in the planned  China share sale  to fund lithium-battery and
solar power-battery projects as well as vehicle and parts
production and development projects, it said in a separate
 statement  today.  
 BYD  was the fastest-growing carmaker by sales in China last
year, more than doubling deliveries to 448,397 vehicles.  
 The company’s sales to dealers rose 3.3 percent in June
from a year earlier to 35,400 vehicles, lagging behind a 23
percent industrywide rise, according to the  China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers .  
 “ BYD  has no control over the A-share sale approval process
as it is purely up to the regulators as to when they can
actually go ahead with the sale,” said  Ricon Xia , an analyst at
Daiwa Institute of Research in Hong Kong. “ BYD  missed the best
timing for the share sale when demand for their cars was
soaring.”  
 Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 
holds a 10 percent stake in  BYD . The Chinese company plans to
offer all-electric e6 hatchbacks in the U.S. this year,
following the domestic success of its gasoline-powered F3,
China’s best-selling car last year.
