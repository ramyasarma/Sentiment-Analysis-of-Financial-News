             The New Jersey Nets hired  Billy King 
to succeed  Rod Thorn  as general manager. King was president of
the Philadelphia 76ers from 2003 to 2007.  
 King is the second major hire for new Nets owner  Mikhail Prokhorov , after coach  Avery Johnson  joined the team last month.
Terms of King’s contract weren’t disclosed.  
 King, 44, replaces the 69-year-old Thorn, who decided to
step down after 10 seasons with the Nets that included two trips
to the National Basketball Association Finals.  
 “He has all of the qualities we’ve been looking for in a
candidate: professionalism; good relations with the league,
players and agents; and strong communications skills,”
Prokhorov said in a statement. “Most importantly, Billy is
ambitious. He wants to win.”  
 King joined the 76ers in 1997 and was promoted to team
president after the 2002-03 season. He was fired by the 76ers in
December 2007 and replaced by former Nets GM  Ed Stefanski .
