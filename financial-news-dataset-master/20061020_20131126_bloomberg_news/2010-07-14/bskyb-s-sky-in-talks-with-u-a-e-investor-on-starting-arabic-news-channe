             British Sky Broadcasting Group
Plc’s  Sky News channel is in talks with an Abu Dhabi-based
private investor to set up an Arabic news service, its first
foreign-language channel.  
 Sky News would run the free, 24-hour channel from Abu
Dhabi as a 50-50 joint venture and could start broadcasting
within 24 months if talks are successful, it said in an e-
mailed statement today.  
 “This venture would build on our existing strengths as an
international news provider and bring the Sky News brand to a
new audience,” John Ryley, head of Sky News, said in the
statement. “Discussions are progressing well and we look
forward to bringing a new approach to Arabic-language news.”  
 BSkyB already broadcasts Sky News in English in the Middle
East. The company, which rejected a 7.8 billion-pound ($11.9
billion) offer from  Rupert Murdoch’s   News Corp.  for the 61
percent of the broadcaster that News Corp. doesn’t already own,
aims to boost its brand and gain viewers outside the U.K. with
the new channel.  
 The service would compete with Arabic channels including
Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya. Saudi Arabia’s Prince  Alwaleed Bin Talal , who has a 7 percent stake in News Corp., will also start
a news television channel “in the near future,” Kingdom
Holding Co. said last week.
