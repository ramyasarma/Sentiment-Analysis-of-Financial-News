             Oil slipped from a two-week high as
equities retreated, while rising U.S. inventories spurred
speculation that a recovery in demand is failing to take root.  
 Futures fell as much as 0.9 percent as  European equity
markets  reversed earlier gains. The industry-funded American
Petroleum Institute said yesterday that U.S. crude, distillate
and gasoline stockpiles gained last week.  
 Oil for August delivery fell as much as 70 cents to $76.45
a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and traded for $76.55 as of 1:29 p.m. London time.
Yesterday, the contract jumped 2.9 percent to $77.15, the
highest level since June 28.  
 “While fundamentals in Europe and the U.S. remain
problematic, the oil price in the last 24 hours has defied
gravity,” said  Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Bache
Commodities Ltd. in London. “The market will struggle to
penetrate $78.”  
 Brent crude for August settlement declined 42 cents to
$76.23 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The August Brent contract expires tomorrow. The more active
September contract fell 50 cents to $76.23 a barrel.  
 The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute said
yesterday that U.S. crude, distillate and gasoline stockpiles
gained last week. Crude  stockpiles  increased 1.74 million
barrels to 353.5 million, according to the API report.  
 Energy Department Report  
 The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. today in Washington. The report may show
that inventories fell 1.5 million barrels last week from 358.2
million, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Refineries probably operated  at 89.8 percent of capacity
last week, unchanged from the previous week, according to the
median of analyst responses. Utilization rates in the week ended
July 2 were at the highest level since January 2008.  
 Analysts were split over whether  gasoline inventories 
increased or declined last week. Supplies probably rose 350,000
barrels from 219.4 million, according to the survey. Fourteen
respondents gave product-supply forecasts. Seven analysts
anticipated an increase, five said there was a decline, and two
estimated no change.  
 Crude oil in New York must challenge resistance around $80
a barrel to move higher, or test support at $72.50, to break out
of its range, according to  Veronique Lashinski , a senior
research analyst for Newedge USA LLC in Chicago.  
 New York oil for September delivery, which will become the
front-month contract on July 21, touched $80.82 a barrel on June
21 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest price since
May 14. The contract fell 65 cents to $76.94 a barrel today
after rising $2.15, or 2.9 percent, yesterday.  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
responsible for 40 percent of global supply, will release its
monthly market report tomorrow. Yesterday,  the International
Energy Agency  forecast that global oil demand will increase at a
slower pace next year, as advanced nations trail China and other
developing countries, in its first assessment of 2011.
