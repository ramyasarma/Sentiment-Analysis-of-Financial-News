             NYSE Arca proposed constraints on
market orders to avoid trades taking place far away from a
security’s current price, according to a statement from NYSE
Euronext.  
 The exchange has filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission plans to introduce the new “price collar,”
according to the statement, in an effort to avoid erroneous
trades like those that occurred during the May 6 market rout
that erased $862 billion from U.S. equities in 20 minutes.  
 Securities listed on Arca represented 13.8 percent of
overall volume on May 6, according to a joint report by the SEC
and the Commodites Futures Trading Commission. Cancellations 
occurred in 225 Arca equities, accounting for 69 percent of 
equities with broken trades that day, the report said.
