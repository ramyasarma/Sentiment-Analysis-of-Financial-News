             Argentines expect prices to rise 25
percent over the next year, according to the median estimate in
a monthly survey by Buenos Aires-based Torcuato Di Tella
University.  
 Expectations remained unchanged from last month’s report,
the university said in an e-mailed report today.  
 The Di Tella poll of 1,205 people was conducted by
Poliarquia Consultores from July 1 to July 12 and has a margin
of error of 3.5 percentage points.
