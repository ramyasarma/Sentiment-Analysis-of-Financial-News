             Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index  gained for
a sixth day, rising 0.7 percent to close at 1,687.94, the
highest since April 27.  
 Kenya’s  All-Share Index  climbed 0.6 percent to close at
75.57, while the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index 
increased 0.3 percent to 24,842.01, according to an e-mailed
note to clients by Renaissance Capital. Namibia’s  FTSE/Namibia
Overall Index  retreated 0.5 percent to 762.14 and the  Ghana
Stock Exchange All-Share Index  dropped for a second day, falling
0.2 percent to 6,265.64.  
 The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  
 Harel Freres Ltd.  (HFRERES MP), which produces 75 percent
of Mauritius’s processed sugar, rose 0.4 rupee, or 1.3 percent,
to 31.6 rupees, the highest close in a month.  
 Harel Freres offered to buy Saint Andre Sugar Estate Co.
and would issue new stock to Saint Andre shareholders, it said
in a statement distributed by the Stock Exchange of Mauritius
after the market closed yesterday.  
 Intercontinental Bank Plc  (INTERCON NL), a Nigerian lender
bailed out by the country’s central bank last year, gained 8
kobo, or 4.9 percent, to 1.72 naira, the highest in almost six
weeks. The bank won a U.K. court order freezing 83 million
pounds ($126 million) in assets held by its former Chief
Executive Officer  Erastus Akingbola .  
 The bank won the global freeze in January in a lawsuit
accusing Akingbola of using the bank’s money to help buy
apartments in London and enrich entities he controlled. The bank
yesterday won permission from a judge to add new claims to the
case, alleging that Akingbola wrongfully directed the lender to
buy its own shares, resulting in a loss.  
 Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd.  (KNCB KN), the East African
nation’s biggest lender by assets and outlets, gained 24 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to 18.05 shillings, the highest since July 8.  
 The stock was upgraded to “hold” from “sell” at
Renaissance Capital.  
 Sasini Ltd.  (STCL KN), a Kenyan tea and coffee grower, fell
5 cents, or 0.4 percent to 14.05 shillings. The average price of
African tea declined to $2.12 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) at the
world’s biggest sale of the leaves in Kenya’s port city of
Mombasa from $2.16 at the previous auction, Tea Brokers East
Africa Ltd. said in an e-mailed report from the city today.
