             Japan’s newest political force will
“leverage” its popularity to push the government and the Bank
of Japan to set an inflation target of 2 percent and seek
further monetary easing, party chief  Yoshimi Watanabe  said.  
 Watanabe’s “ Your Party ,” formed less than a year ago, won
10 seats in the July 11 election for the  upper house  of
parliament. His group garnered almost 8 million votes, the
third-best tally behind Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s  Democratic
Party of Japan  and the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party .  
 “We can now use our leverage to push for our agenda,”
Watanabe, 58, said in an interview today in Tokyo. “Our
priority is anti-deflation legislation because Japan’s economy
faces the risk of a double-dip recession. We want to revise the
BOJ law so the central bank and the government can agree on a
goal of 2 percent inflation within two to three years.”  
 The ruling DPJ, which lost 10 seats in the upper house race,
and most opposition parties agree on the need to end more than a
decade of  falling prices  that threatens Japan’s economic
recovery. The BOJ under political pressure unveiled a 10
trillion yen ($112.5 billion) loan program in December for banks
and doubled the facility in March. In June, the bank released
details of a separate 3 trillion yen plan to encourage lending
to companies.  
 The central bank cut its benchmark  interest rate  to 0.1
percent in December 2008.  
 “The BOJ bears certain responsibility for the fact that
Japan is still in deflation,” Watanabe, a former LDP financial
services minister, said. He said the law guaranteeing the
central bank’s independence should be revised to allow more
government input.  
 “Theoretically it would be beneficial to discuss the right
to dismiss the BOJ governor,” he said.
