             Qatar Islamic Bank , the Gulf state’s
biggest lender complying with Muslim banking rules, posted a 35
percent drop in second-quarter profit that fell short of analyst
estimates.  
 Net income fell to 301 million riyals ($80 million) from
462.4 million riyals a year earlier, according to Bloomberg News
calculations based on an e-mailed release of first-half net
income of 601 million riyals. The mean estimate of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a second-quarter profit
of 353 million riyals.  
 The results marked the fourth straight quarterly decline in
profit for the bank. The bank’s Islamic loan portfolio rose 45
percent to 28.6 billion riyals in the first half from 19.7
billion riyals a year earlier, Qatar Islamic said.  
 “Strong loan growth hasn’t really lifted earnings,” Murad
Ansari, a Riyadh-based equity analyst at EFG Hermes KSA, said in
a telephone interview. “That’s disappointing.”  
 Qatar’s government has sought to bolster lenders, including
Qatar Islamic, by acquiring stakes in banks and purchasing their
real-estate assets. Qatar Islamic said it sold a 5 percent stake
to the country’s sovereign wealth fund late last year for 956
million riyals. Last month, the bank bought 1.25 billion riyals
of Islamic bonds offered by the government.  
 Qatar Islamic plans to sell as much as $750 million of
bonds this year in its first Islamic debt offering, Chief
Executive Officer  Salah Mohammed Jaidah  said in May.  
 The bank’s shares fell 3.7 percent this year compared with
a 0.9 percent gain for the QE Index of leading Qatari companies.
Qatar Islamic shares rose 1.5 percent to 75 riyals on the Qatar
Exchange today. Earnings were reported after the close of
trading.
