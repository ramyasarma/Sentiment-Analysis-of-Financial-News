             The ruble gained for a third day
against the dollar to its strongest level in nearly two months
as optimism about the global economic recovery boosted the
appeal of emerging-market assets.  
 The Russian currency added 0.7 percent to 30.5250, heading
for its strongest close since May 18, by 11:32 a.m. in Moscow.
The yield on Russia’s dollar bonds due 2020 fell 10 basis points
to 5.178 percent, the lowest since April.  
 Crude for August delivery traded near its highest level in
two weeks before a report forecast to show that inventories
declined last week in the U.S., the world’s largest energy user.  
 “Looks like a new wave of optimism in the global markets
resulting from good earnings in the U.S.,” said  Denis Korshilov , head of foreign-exchange trading at Citigroup Inc. in
Moscow. Korshilov said companies are buying the ruble to make
tax payments due after July 15.  
 Investors pared bets that the ruble will weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 30.7219
per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of 30.7830 on
July 13. The contracts are a guide to expectations of currency
movements as they allow foreign investors and companies to fix
the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The currency weakened 0.2 percent to 38.8375 per euro,
leaving it at 34.2758, the strongest since June 28, against the
central bank’s  target  currency basket, which is used to manage
swings that hurt Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
