             Ashmore Group Plc , a U.K. money
manager that focuses on emerging markets, said assets under
management rose 7 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, boosted
by inflows into debt, currency and special situations funds.  
 Assets climbed to $35.3 billion at the end of June from $33
billion three months earlier, the London-based firm said in a
statement today. Net inflows totaled $2.9 billion.  
 The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  dropped 9.1 percent in the
quarter as concern about Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis spread,
leading investors to shun riskier assets. That triggered an
underperformance of Ashmore funds, which declined by $600
million in the period, the firm said.  
 The fund manager, which first sold shares in 2006, focuses
on emerging markets through local currency, distressed debt and
private equity funds.
