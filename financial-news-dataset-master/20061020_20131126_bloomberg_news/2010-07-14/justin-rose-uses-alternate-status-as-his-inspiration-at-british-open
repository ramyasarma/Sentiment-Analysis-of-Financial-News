             Justin Rose ’s long day waiting on
the practice tee at St. Andrews inspired the Englishman to make
the field at this year’s British Open.  
 Rose was the first alternate the last time the Open was
played on the Old Course in 2005 and waited on the driving range
from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. for someone to drop out, which didn’t
happen. He was in the same situation a month later at the U.S.
PGA Championship and again didn’t get to play.  
 “That spurred me on,” Rose said today at press conference
today at St. Andrews. “I just did not like the feeling. I
wanted to be a part of it, felt I should be a part of it.”  
 Two wins in the U.S. in the past six weeks guaranteed that
Rose will be playing when the Open begins tomorrow. It’s his
ninth appearance in the championship and his first at the
Scottish course known as the “Home of Golf.”  
 “To me it’s the Open to play,” said Rose, who will be
paired with top-ranked  Tiger Woods  and Colombia’s  Camilo Villegas  in the first two rounds. “It’s the one I wanted to
play. I’m glad it worked out.”  
 The 29-year-old Rose made his debut at the Open as an
amateur in 1998, pitching in on the final hole to finish fourth.
As a professional, his best finishes have been 12th in 2007 and
a tie for 13th last year.  
 Rose has two wins in his last three starts on the U.S. PGA
Tour. He has four top-10 finishes in 15 starts this season and
is third on the U.S. money list with almost $3.2 million.  
 “Confidence comes with good play and there’s certainly
been some of that recently for me to enjoy,” he said.  
 Rose, No. 16 in the  Official World Golf Ranking , is among
five top golfers expected to challenge to become the first
Englishman to win the Open since  Nick Faldo  in 1992.  
 English Contenders  
 Third-ranked  Lee Westwood , No. 7  Luke Donald , No. 8  Ian Poulter  and No. 10  Paul Casey  have each come close in recent
years. Westwood and Donald both finished in the top five last
year, while Poulter was runner-up to  Padraig Harrington  as Casey
tied for seventh in 2008.  
 “You look at the world rankings, you look at the
opportunity for us, it’s probably better than it’s been, dare I
say numbers-wise, ever,” Rose said. “Just using that basis, I
think one of us will be in contention Sunday afternoon.”
