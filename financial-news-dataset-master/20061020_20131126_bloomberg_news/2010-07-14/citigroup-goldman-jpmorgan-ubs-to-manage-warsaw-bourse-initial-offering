             Poland chose Citigroup Inc., Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG to manage the
initial public offering of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, central
Europe’s biggest equity market.  
 Ipopema Securities SA, KBC Groep NV, Societe Generale SA,
and PKO Bank Polski SA will be bookrunners for the November
offering of a 63 percent stake, the Treasury Ministry said on
its website today. Bank Ochrony Srodowiska SA, Alior Bank SA,
Banco Espirito Santo SA, IDM SA and Wood & Co. will also help
manage the offering.  
 The sale is part of a government plan to raise 25 billion
zloty ($7.8 billion) in 2010 to help finance the widening budget
deficit. Poland this year sold stakes in insurance, energy,
copper and coal mining companies.  
 Poland’s only stock exchange has total capitalization
exceeding $150 billion, according to Bloomberg data. More than
500 companies trade on its main market and NewConnect platform
for smaller companies. The Treasury Ministry didn’t give any
valuation for the stake.  
 Poland last year tried to sell a majority stake in the
bourse, soliciting bids from the London Stock Exchange Group
Plc, NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and Deutsche Boerse
AG. It received no binding offers.
