             European stocks  closed little
changed after a six-day rally pushed valuations to the highest
level in two months, offsetting a record profit forecast from
Intel Corp., the world’s biggest chipmaker.  
 ICAP Plc led declining shares after saying trading volumes
“slowed significantly” in June.  BP Plc  fell 2.3 percent as the
company delayed testing of a new cap placed over its leaking
Gulf of Mexico oil well. Technology companies limited the drop,
with ASML Holding NV gaining 3.1 percent on better-than-
estimated profit.  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  slipped less than 0.1 percent to
255.92, paring earlier losses in the final hour of trading. The
measure had risen 8.2 percent over the previous six days,
leaving the gauge trading at more than 16 times its companies’
reported profits, the highest  valuation  since May, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 “The market needed a breather it was looking as if it got
a little bit ahead of itself,” said  Mike Lenhoff , London-based
chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities Ltd., whose parent
company oversees $33 billion. “Earnings are coming in a little
bit better than expected but the season is just getting under
way. The market might not be quite confident enough about
whether it should be pushing forward or not.”  
 National benchmark indexes rose in 11 of the 18 western
European markets. Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 percent, while the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 0.3 percent and France’s CAC 40 declined
0.1 percent.  
 Retail Sales  
 In the U.S., a report today showed  retail sales  fell in
June for a second month, indicating the pace of economic
recovery moderated heading into the second half of 2010.
Purchases decreased a more-than-projected 0.5 percent following
a 1.1 percent May drop, Commerce Department figures showed.  
 ICAP  dropped 4.6 percent to 416.1 pence after the biggest
broker of transactions between banks  said “volumes slowed
significantly in June as customers’ and end investors’ risk
appetites reduced.” The company also said analysts’ profit
forecasts appear “reasonable.”  
 Numis Securities Ltd. lowered its recommendation for  ICAP 
to “hold” from “add,” saying they do not expect to
materially change their earnings estimates of 350 million pounds
($534 million).  
 BP  dropped 2.3 percent to 401 pence as the company delayed
testing the oil-well cap to give scientists more time to study
the procedure used to measure pressure levels and crude fell
below $77 a barrel.  
 Acergy, ITV  
 Acergy SA, a U.K. provider of oil services, sank 5.4
percent to 97.8 kroner as Chief Executive Officer  Jean Cahuzac 
said BP’s leaking well may delay deepwater projects beyond 2011.  
 ITV Plc  declined 3.9 percent to 52.4 pence after BofA
Merrill Lynch Global Research lowered its recommendation for the
U.K.’s biggest commercial broadcaster to “underperform” from
“neutral,” citing the shares “expensive” valuations.  
 ARM Holdings Plc led a  gauge  of technology companies to
two-week high, limiting declines in the Stoxx 600. The shares
rallied 3.1 percent to 318.5 pence as Intel, whose processors
run more than 80 percent of the world’s personal computers,
reported second-quarter sales of $10.8 billion, topping the
average analyst estimate of $10.3 billion. Net income was $2.89
billion, or 51 cents a share.  
 The chipmaker said its gross-profit margin will reach 66
percent this year and forecast third-quarter sales of about
$11.6 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $10.9 billion in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 U.S. Earnings  
 Intel’s results followed better-than-estimated profit from
Alcoa Inc. and CSX Corp. yesterday, among 23 companies in the
S&P 500 to announce earnings this week. Earnings for the gauge’s
companies are projected to have climbed 34 percent in the second
quarter and by the same amount in 2010, according to analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 STMicroelectronics NV, Europe’s biggest chipmaker,
increased 2.3 percent to 6.92 euros and Infineon Technologies AG
rose 2.4 percent to 5.31 euros.  
 ASML  jumped 3.1 percent to 25.15 euros after reporting
second-quarter net income of 239 million euros ($304 million) as
chip companies increased spending to meet demand. That compared
with a net loss of 104 million euros a year earlier and beat the
average analyst estimate of 203 million euros.  
 London Stock Exchange Group Plc climbed 3.6 percent to
626.5 pence after reporting a 0.8 percent increase in first-
quarter sales to 158.2 million pounds as the bourse made more
money from technology.

                          July 14 (Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li from Santa Clara, California, about the outlook for sales.
     Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, reported record second-quarter sales and topped analysts' estimates with its forecast for this period, allaying concern that a rebound in technology spending is losing steam. Smith also discusses the company's investments in China. (Source: Bloomberg)
