             Hyundai Elevator Co. , South Korea’s
largest elevator-maker by sales, plans to sell 80 billion won
($67 million) of bonds to repay maturing debt, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  
 The two- and three-year notes may pay coupons of 5.9
percent and 6.3 percent respectively, said the people, who asked
not to be identified before a final decision.  
 Investors are demanding a higher risk premium to buy the
debt because of a conflict with creditors, who said this month
they won’t provide new loans to Hyundai Elevator and eight
affiliates until the group signs an agreement to reorganize its
finances, one of the people said.  
 Senior unsecured debt issued by the Icheon, Gyeonggi-based
company is rated A, the sixth-highest investment grade by Korea
Investors Service Inc. The average coupon paid on A rated two-
year notes issued by South Korean companies was 4.67 percent
yesterday and 5.2 percent on three-year bonds, according to data
compiled by the Korea Financial Investment Association.  
 Telephone calls to Hyundai Elevator’s main office seeking
comment weren’t answered.  
 Hyundai Elevator has 80 billion won in bonds  due  in
November and paid a 6.5 percent coupon when it sold 30 billion
won of three-year notes last September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.
