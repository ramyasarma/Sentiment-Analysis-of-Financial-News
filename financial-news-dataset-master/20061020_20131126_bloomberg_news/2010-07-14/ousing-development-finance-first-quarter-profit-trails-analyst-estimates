             Housing Development Finance Corp. ,
India’s largest mortgage lender, posted a less-than-expected 23
percent gain in first-quarter profit amid increasing competition
from rivals.  
 Net income rose to 6.95 billion rupees ($149 million), or
23.54 rupees a share, for the three months ended June 30, from
5.65 billion rupees, or 19.16 rupees, a year earlier, according
to a Bombay Stock Exchange statement today. That missed the 7.53
billion rupee average of 12  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Housing Development Finance, based in Mumbai, this month
extended a program offering loans for as low as 8.25 percent as
competition with rivals including  State Bank of India Ltd. , the
nation’s largest lender, and ICICI Bank Ltd. to fund new home
buyers increased in Asia’s third-largest economy.  
 “HDFC is conservative in comparison to lenders like SBI
and ICICI,” said  Deepak Tiwari , an analyst at K.R. Choksey
Shares & Securities Pvt., who rates the stock as a “hold.”
“They have chosen to grow at the same rate over the last
several quarters to maintain asset quality.”  
 Shares of HDFC closed in Mumbai trading at 3,076.85 rupees,
up 0.4 percent. The stock  pared gains  of as much as 2.6 percent
earlier in the day following the results announcement.
