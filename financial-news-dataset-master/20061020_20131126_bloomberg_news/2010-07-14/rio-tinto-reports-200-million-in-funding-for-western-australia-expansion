             Rio Tinto Group , the world’s second-
largest iron ore producer, approved $200 million in spending to
start expanding its Pilbara iron ore operations in Australia by
50 percent.  
 The money will be used to start dredging work ahead of the
development that will take annual capacity to 330 million metric
tons by 2016, the London-based company said today in a
statement. Rio now has capacity of 220 million tons a year.  
 Rio revived its expansion studies last week after Australia
reduced a planned mine profit tax. The world’s  third-largest
mining company  “remains cautious” while it awaits the final
legislation, Rio’s Chief Executive Officer of Iron Ore  Sam Walsh 
said in the statement.  
 Rio  gained  1.9 percent to A$67.81 at 10:22 a.m. Sydney time
on the Australian stock exchange. The company is scheduled to
report its production for the second quarter later today.  
 The expansion to 330 million tons a year capacity will be
completed in stages with increments to 225 million tons by the
first quarter of next year, 230 million tons by the second
quarter of 2012 and 280 million tons in the first half of 2014,
Rio said today. Dredging of the Cape Lambert port needs
government and other approvals, it said.
