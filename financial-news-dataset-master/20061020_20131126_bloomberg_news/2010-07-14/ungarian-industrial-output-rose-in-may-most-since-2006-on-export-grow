             Hungary recorded the biggest annual
increase in industrial  output  in May since December 2006 as
improved export demand and a revival in domestic spending helped
the country exit its worst recession since 1991.  
 Production advanced 13.7 percent, rising for a fifth month,
after climbing 9.7 percent in April, the statistics office said
in a revised report today. The data matched the preliminary
estimate. Output gained 5.4 percent in the month, the most since
January.  
 The first  European Union  member to get an  International
Monetary Fund -led bailout in 2008, Hungary cut spending to meet
the terms of its loan. The measures damped local demand and the
country is looking to the euro region, which buys 60 percent of
products made or assembled in Hungary such as Audi cars and
Nokia phones, to support its recovery. Production declined 22.1
percent in the year-earlier period.  
 Hungary exited its recession in the fourth quarter and
growth accelerated in the first three months of the year. The
 economy shrank  6.3 percent last year as exporters including the
local units of Alcoa Inc. and Suzuki Motor Corp. scaled back
output to cope with faltering global demand. The central bank
expects gross domestic product to grow 0.9 percent this year.
