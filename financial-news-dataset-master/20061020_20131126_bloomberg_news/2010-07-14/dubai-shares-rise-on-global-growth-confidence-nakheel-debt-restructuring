             Qatar shares advanced to the highest
level this month, leading Gulf markets higher, on increased
confidence in the global recovery after Singapore raised its
economic growth forecast. Saudi shares retreated as oil fell.  
 The  QE Index  climbed 0.9 percent to 7,018.48, the highest
since June 28.  Qatar Islamic Bank , the Gulf state’s biggest
Shariah-compliant lender, led the gain.  Qatar Insurance Co. 
advanced 4.1 percent, the most in two months. The  Bloomberg GCC
200  slipped 0.1 percent and Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share
Index  lost 0.7 percent.  
 “Gains in global markets, especially Asia, helped push up
local shares,” said Humam al-Shamaa, economic adviser at Al-
Fajer Securities LLC, a U.A.E. brokerage.  
 The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index  climbed 1.4 percent, poised for
the highest close since June 22, after Singapore raised its
growth forecast for a third time this year as manufacturing
output surged and after Intel Corp., the world’s biggest
chipmaker, raised its profit forecast. The  MSCI World Index  of
developed nations added 0.1 percent.  
 Oil for August delivery retreated 0.9 percent to $76.48 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Saudi Arabia holds
21 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves.  
 Qatar Islamic Bank increased 1.5 percent to 75 riyals, the
highest since May 18. The company with the third-heaviest
weighting on Qatar’s index posted a first-half profit of 601
million riyals ($165 million) after the market closed. It didn’t
give comparative figures. Qatar Insurance advanced the most
since May 10, increasing to 68.7 riyals.  
 In Saudi Arabia,  Filing & Packing Materials Manufacturing
Co.,  the plastic-bag maker, decreased 5.6 percent, the most
since May 25, to 26.8 riyals, after it said second-quarter
profit fell 26 percent to 2.95 million riyals ($786,708).  
 Dubai’s  DFM General Index  declined 0.2 percent after
earlier climbing as much as 0.7 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index  rose
0.2 percent and Bahrain’s  gauge  added less than 0.1 percent. Abu
Dhabi’s  benchmark  increased 0.4 percent and the  Kuwait Stock
Exchange Index  gained 0.6 percent.
