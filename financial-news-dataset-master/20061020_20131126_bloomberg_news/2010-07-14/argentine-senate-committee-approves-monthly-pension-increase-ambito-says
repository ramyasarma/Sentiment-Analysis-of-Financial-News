             Argentina’s Senate Budget Committee
yesterday approved a proposal to raise the minimum monthly
pension payment to the equivalent of 82 percent of the minimum
wage, newspaper  Ambito Financiero  reported.  
 The bill would raise the monthly pension payment to 1,230
pesos ($313) per month, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said,
citing opposition Senator  Gerardo Morales . The bill will go to
the Senate floor for debate in two weeks, Ambito said.  
 The spending increase required by the proposal would push
the social security system into default and undermine the
government’s finances, Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  told the
committee yesterday, according to the newspaper.
