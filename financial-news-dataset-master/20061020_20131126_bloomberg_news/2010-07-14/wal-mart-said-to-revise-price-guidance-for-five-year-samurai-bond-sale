             Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
biggest retailer, revised its price guidance for sales of five-
year Samurai bonds, according to a person with direct knowledge
of the transaction.  
 The retailer told investors it may price fixed-rate bonds
to yield between 30 basis points and 35 basis points more than
the yen swap rate, said the person, who asked not to be
identified as the information is private.  
 Wal-Mart also plans to sell floating-rate notes yielding
between 45 basis points and 50 basis points more than the three
month London interbank offered rate for yen, the person said.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities Co. and Mizuho Securities Co. are helping the
Bentonville, Arkansas-based company sell the bonds, according to
a July 12 filing with Japan’s Finance Ministry.  
 Samurai bonds are yen-denominated debt sold in Japan by
overseas borrowers and a basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
