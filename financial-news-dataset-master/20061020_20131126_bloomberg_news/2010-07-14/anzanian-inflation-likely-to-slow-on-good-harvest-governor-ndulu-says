             Tanzania’s inflation rate will
likely fall for the third straight month in July after good
rains raised crop supplies and lowered food prices, Central Bank
Governor Benno Ndulu said.  
 Inflation slowed to 7.2 percent in June compared with 7.9
percent a month earlier and 9.4 percent in April, the Dar es
Salaam-based National Bureau of Statistics said on July 12.   
 “With agriculture we had a very good season, good rains,
plenty of food and other crops,” Ndulu told reporters today in
the Kenyan capital, Nairobi today. “In July, inflation could go
down even further.”
