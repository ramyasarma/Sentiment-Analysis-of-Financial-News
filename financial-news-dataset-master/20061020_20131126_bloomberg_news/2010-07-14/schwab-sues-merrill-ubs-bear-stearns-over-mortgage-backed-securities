             Units of  Bank of America Corp. ’s
Merrill Lynch & Co.,  UBS AG  and Bear Stearns Cos. were sued by
 Charles Schwab Corp.  over claims they lied or omitted
information on mortgage-backed securities it bought from them.  
 Schwab, an independent online broker, claims it paid the
firms $130 million for three securities, and that more dubious
securities are likely to turn up if the suit is allowed to go
forward. The complaint was filed June 29 in state court in San
Francisco, where Schwab is based.  
 The securities dealers lied or didn’t disclose information
about loans underlying the bonds they sold, including the loan-
to-value ratios of mortgages and the number of properties that
were not primary residences, according to the complaint.  
 Bill Halldin , a Bank of America spokesman, said the
securities Merrill Lynch issued that are identified in the suit
are “performing well, are not in default, and therefore we
don’t believe there’s any basis for the complaint.” Merrill
Lynch is the world’s largest brokerage.  
 Schwab said that when the dealers offered and sold the
securities, they “made numerous statements to Schwab about the
certificates and the credit quality of the mortgage loans that
back them” that were “untrue” or “omitted,” according to
the complaint. Schwab also said the firms weren’t truthful about
how much they departed from their own standards in making the
loans.  
 JPMorgan Chase declined to comment, spokesman  Joe Evangelisti  said in an e-mail.  
 UBS spokeswoman  Karina Byrne  didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment after regular business hours yesterday.  
 Wells Fargo & Co.  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , which acquired
Bear Stearns in 2008, are also named in the complaint.  
 The case is Charles Schwab v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith, 10-501151, California Superior Court (San Francisco).
