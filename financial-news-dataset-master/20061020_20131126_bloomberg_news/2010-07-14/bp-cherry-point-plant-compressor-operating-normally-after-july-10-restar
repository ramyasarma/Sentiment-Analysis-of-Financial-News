             BP Plc  restarted a compressor at its
Cherry Point refinery in Washington after a malfunction led the
unit to fail July 10, a state agency said.  
 An estimated 1,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide was released
into the atmosphere between midnight and 3:00 a.m. July 10 after
a compressor failed on the plant’s hydrocracking unit, according
to a report from the Northwest Clean Air Agency.  
 Repairs were made and the compressor restarted, the report
said. Operations are normal at the plant, a person familiar with
the refinery’s operations said, asking not to be identified.  
 BP’s Cherry Point refinery has a capacity of 225,000
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The plant supplies about 20 percent of Washington’s
gasoline requirements and fuels four out of every five plans at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to BP’s  website .
