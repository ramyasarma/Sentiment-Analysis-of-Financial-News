             The euro slid against the yen as
Europe’s industrial output rose less than economists forecast
and Spain’s financial institutions borrowed a record amount from
the European Central Bank.  
 Sterling touched a two-month high versus the dollar as the
U.K.’s unemployment fell and the number of jobless benefit
claimants dropped to the lowest in a year. The euro rallied
yesterday against the dollar after Greece sold Treasury bills at
a rate below the 5 percent charged by the European Union when it
rescued the nation from default.  
 “We doubt if the euro’s recent gains will be sustained,”
said  Ian Stannard , a currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in
London. “The industrial output data this morning was weaker
than expected. There’s still a lot of skepticism about the
health of the banking sector in the euro region.”  
 The euro fell 0.3 percent to 112.56 yen at 7:40 a.m. in New
York, from 112.90 yesterday. The euro slid 0.2 percent to
$1.2699, from $1.2724, after touching $1.2739 yesterday,
matching the high on May 12. The dollar dropped 0.1 percent to
88.62 yen, from 88.74.  
 The pound appreciated as the Office for National Statistics
said today in London that unemployment was 2.47 million in the
quarter through May, declining for the first time since January.
The number of people claiming jobless benefits in June fell by
20,800, more than the median forecast of 22 economists.  
 Sterling advanced 0.4 percent to $1.5241, from $1.5178,
after touching $1.5291, the highest level since May 3. The pound
appreciated 0.7 percent to 83.29 pence per euro.  
 Europe’s Output  
 The 16-nation currency advanced versus the yen as Eurostat
in Luxembourg reported that industrial production in the euro
area increased 9.4 percent in May from a year ago. The median
forecast of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was for an
11.4 percent gain.  
 A report from the Bank of Spain showed Spanish lenders
borrowed a record 126.3 billion euros ($161 billion) from the
ECB in June as investors shunned the nation’s banks.  
 Spain’s banks increased borrowing 48 percent from 85.6
billion euros in May. That compares with a drop of 4 percent to
496.6 billion euros that the ECB provided lenders in the whole
euro area. Spanish banks haven’t sold any bonds publicly in the
past two months on concern the nation won’t be able to cut its
deficit without hurting the economy.  
 The extra  yield  that investors demand to hold Spain’s
government bonds compared with benchmark German debt has widened
to 2 percentage points, from 0.59 percentage point at the start
of the year.  
 Singapore’s Growth  
 Asian currencies rose earlier after a government report
showed Singapore’s economy accelerated to a record 18.1 percent
pace in the first half, adding to signs the region is shrugging
off the European debt crisis.  
 Singapore’s gross domestic product expanded at a 26 percent
annualized rate in the second quarter from the previous three
months, after a revised 45.9 percent gain in January to March,
the trade ministry said.  
 The growth “should reinforce the view that fears
from the euro zone crisis may be exaggerated,”  Philip Wee ,
senior currency economist in Singapore at DBS Group Holdings
Ltd., wrote in a research note. “Sentiment should remain
constructive, not only for the Singapore dollar, but also other
Asia ex-Japan currencies and commodity currencies.”  
 South Korea’s won jumped 0.8 percent to 1,202.33 against
the greenback, and Singapore’s dollar was little changed at
S$1.3750 after touching a three-week high of S$1.3733.

                          July 14 (Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li from Santa Clara, California, about the outlook for sales.
     Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, reported record second-quarter sales and topped analysts' estimates with its forecast for this period, allaying concern that a rebound in technology spending is losing steam. Smith also discusses the company's investments in China. (Source: Bloomberg)
