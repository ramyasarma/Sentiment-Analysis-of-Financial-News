             German government spokesman
Christoph Steegmans said Chancellor Angela Merkel’s main policy
initiatives, including the budget for 2011 and health policy
changes, will be largely unaffected by a changed majority in the
Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament. Steegmans spoke at a
regular government press conference in Berlin.
