             Portugal’s Sergio Paulinho of the
RadioShack team won stage 10 of the Tour de France, beating
Vasil Kiryienka in a photo finish after the pair broke away from
the leading group with 10 miles left.  
 The stage was a 111-mile ride between Chambery and Gap. Race
leader Andy Schleck and second-placed Alberto Contador were
following in the main pack of riders.
