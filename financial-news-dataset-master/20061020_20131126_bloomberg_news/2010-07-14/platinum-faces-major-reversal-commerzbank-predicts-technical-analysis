             Platinum prices may face months of
declines, possibly losing more than $200 an ounce with a “major
reversal” under way, according to a technical analysis from
Commerzbank AG that cited trading patterns.  
 Platinum, used in auto catalysts, has fallen about 13
percent since touching a 21-month high of $1,756.25 an ounce on
April 27. The metal traded today at $1,533 an ounce after
rebounding 2 percent last week, the first weekly climb in three.  
 “Once this minor corrective rebound has run its course, we
look for downside pressure to resume,”  Karen Jones , a London-
based technical analyst, wrote in a report. A fall to $1,442
“would confirm that a major reversal lower has been taking
place,” Jones wrote. The 200-week moving average at $1,383 is
“then coming to the fore again,” Jones said.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to try to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A decline in platinum prices would
curb producers’ profits, while making car parts cheaper.  
 Further declines for platinum may be “in store for the
weeks and months ahead,” with a 38.2 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the 2008 decline to $1,306.84 an ounce being a
possible medium- to longer-term target, she wrote.  
 The significance of 38 percent comes from the Fibonacci
sequence, which is used by some traders to try to predict points
of resistance and support as markets repeat parts of earlier
movements. Resistance points are marked by clusters of orders to
sell, while supports are the reverse of that.
