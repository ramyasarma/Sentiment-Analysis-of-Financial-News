             Sugar loading at Brazil’s main port
is halted for the second consecutive day because of rain,
increasing a record backlog of vessels waiting to transport the
sweetener, said Copersucar SA.  
 The same vessels that were docked yesterday are still
waiting to be loaded, a spokesman for Copersucar, who can’t be
named because of company’s policy, said today.  
 Today there are 107 delayed vessels at six Brazilian sugar
ports, up from 103 yesterday when rainfall started, according to
 Santos Associados Consultoria Ltda . and shipping company Unimar
Agenciamentos Maritimos Ltda. The number of vessels waiting in
the  Santos Port  rose to 74 from 70 yesterday.  
 Brazilian ports are struggling to keep up with demand for
the sweetener. The country, the world’s biggest producer,
accounts for 54 percent of the world’s exports, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.  
 Rainfall started yesterday and is expected to continue
until Saturday, the port of Santos said on its website.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.2 cent, or 1.2
percent, to 16.97 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Before today, the price tumbled 36 percent this year on
forecasts that rising output will end two years of supply
deficits.  
 Copersucar, based in Sao Paulo, owns the second-largest
sugar terminal at the port of Santos. It is a sugar and ethanol
cooperative with 39 associate mills.
