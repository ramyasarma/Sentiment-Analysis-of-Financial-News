Chairman  Pham Thanh Binh  was suspended from his post as the
government began an investigation into financial difficulties at
the state-controlled company.  
 Prime Minister  Nguyen Tan Dung  decided on the probe to
review Binh’s “responsibilities and to investigate and clarify
faults,” according to a statement on the government’s website
today. Deputy Minister of Transport  Nguyen Hong Truong  was
appointed as the replacement chairman, the government said.  
 Vinashin, as the shipbuilder is known, doesn’t have enough
funds for some projects after its customers and lenders were hit
by the global recession that started in 2008, the  Ministry of
Transportation  said July 1. The company also over-diversified
its businesses and hasn’t managed its cash flow and debt
properly, according to the transport ministry statement.  
 The Hanoi-based shipbuilder will transfer some companies
and projects unrelated to its main business to other
corporations to pare debts and add capital to ongoing
shipbuilding contracts, the ministry said.  
 The government passed the proceeds from Vietnam’s first
overseas bond sale, a $750 million security sold in 2005, to
Vinashin.
