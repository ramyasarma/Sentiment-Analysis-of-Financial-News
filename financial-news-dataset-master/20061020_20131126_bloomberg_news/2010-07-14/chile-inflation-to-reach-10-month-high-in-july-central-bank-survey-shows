             Chile’s consumer prices may rise the
most in 10 months on higher transport costs and taxes on loans,
a  survey of traders  and investors showed.  
 Prices may increase 0.6 percent this month from June,
according to the median forecast of 38 money-market traders,
pension and mutual fund managers and insurance companies in a
central bank survey published today. That would be the biggest
monthly gain since September.  
 The country’s  central bank  will lift its benchmark interest
rate a half-point to 1.5 percent at a monetary policy meeting
tomorrow and raise borrowing costs to 3 percent in six months
and 4.5 percent in 12 months, according to today’s survey.  
 The central bank raised the interest rate on June 15 for
the first time since September 2008 as growing consumer spending
and a lag in output caused by the 8.8-magnitude earthquake in
February pushes up prices. July’s price data will reflect an
increase in ticket prices on Santiago’s public transport system
and an increased duty on lending.  
 Inflation may accelerate to 3.5 percent in 12 months,
today’s survey showed. Policy makers target annual inflation of
3 percent.  
 Chile’s peso will strengthen to 535 per U.S. dollar in
seven days, today’s survey showed. The peso slid 0.2 percent to
536.53 at 10:02 a.m. New York time today.
