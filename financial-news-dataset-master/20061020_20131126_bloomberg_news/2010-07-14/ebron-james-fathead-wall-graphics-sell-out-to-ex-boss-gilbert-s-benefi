             The  LeBron James  Fathead wall
graphic discounted with a link to Benedict Arnold has sold out.  
 Fathead LLC’s  website sold the last of more than 1,000
James “Slam Dunk” products for $17.41, down from original
prices as high as $99.99. The discount price also signifies the
year 1741, when Arnold, a colonial army officer who  offered to
surrender  West Point to the British for money during the
Revolutionary War, was born.  
 Fathead, based in Livonia, Michigan, is owned by  Dan Gilbert , who also runs the Cleveland Cavaliers, where James
played seven years and was named the National Basketball
Association’s Most Valuable Player the last two seasons.  
 James jumped to the Miami Heat as a free agent last week.
Gilbert called his former star’s departure a cowardly betrayal
and drew a $100,000 fine from NBA Commissioner  David Stern .  
 Michael Layne, Fathead’s director of Internet marketing,
said another version of the graphic showing James in a yellow
Cavs’ uniform had sold more than 500 copies since its release
last weekend at a “Declaring Independence” price of $17.76.  
 Layne also said that the company would sell a Fathead
graphic of James in a Heat uniform later this year.  
 “I’m sure we could come up with a fun number for the
price,” he said in an e-mail. “In fact, we’ve been kicking
around a pre-order special at $63.01.”  
 James and his All-Star teammates with the Heat,  Dwyane Wade 
and  Chris Bosh , will wear the numbers 6, 3, and 1 next season.
