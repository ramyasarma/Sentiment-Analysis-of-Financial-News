             FriendFinder Networks Inc. , the
owner of Penthouse magazine, delayed its bid for  Playboy
Enterprises Inc.  a second time since Playboy founder  Hugh Hefner ’s $123 million offer to take the company private.  
 An “offer is forthcoming,” FriendFinder Chief Executive
Officer  Marc Bell  said yesterday in an interview. He declined to
say when his closely held company will bid for Playboy, after
originally saying an offer might come July 12 and later pushing
that back to yesterday.  
 FriendFinder’s bid is taking longer than Bell expected
because his “lawyers are taking their time,” he said.  
 Hefner, with partner Rizvi Traverse Management LLC, plans
to offer $5.50 apiece for Playboy’s Class A and Class B shares,
Playboy disclosed July 12. The offer, which exceeds either
class’s July 9 closing price by more than 30 percent, values
Chicago-based Playboy at about $185 million.  
 The 84-year-old founder of Playboy already owns 69.5
percent of the Class A voting stock and 27.7 percent of the
Class B non-voting stock. In a posting on Twitter, Hefner
responded to the potential competing bid from FriendFinder.  
 “Penthouse really isn’t in the picture,” Hefner said.
“I’m buying, not selling.”  
 Lawsuit Filed  
 In response to Hefner’s bid, other Playboy shareholders
filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington,
Delaware.  
 “The going-private Plan is the product of a flawed process
designed to sell PEI to Hefner and Rizvi Traverse on terms
detrimental” to stockholders of Playboy,  Carmella P. Keener ,
the lawyer representing shareholders, said in the complaint.  
 FriendFinder, based in Boca Raton, Florida, operates adult-
themed websites such as AdultFriendFinder.com and Cams.com. The
company this year postponed an initial public offering that was
planned to raise as much as $240 million, according to a U.S.
Securities & Exchange Commission regulatory filing. The company
was selling a 49 percent stake and said it would use the
proceeds to pay down debt.  
 The company lost money in 2006, 2007, 2008 and for the
first nine months of 2009, according to the SEC filings. It had
$409.5 million in long-term debt as of Sept. 30, 2009, the most
recent figures available because the offering was delayed.  
 Bell said that about half of FriendFinder’s debt is held by
insiders and the company would have no problem financing a
purchase of Playboy.  
 “Financing is not an issue for us,” Bell said. “There’s
no debt issue.”  
 Playboy  Class B  shares fell 18 cents to $5.37 yesterday on
the New York Stock Exchange, following a 41 percent jump on July
12. The  Class A  shares declined 12 cents to $5.42 yesterday and
gained 36 percent on July 12.
