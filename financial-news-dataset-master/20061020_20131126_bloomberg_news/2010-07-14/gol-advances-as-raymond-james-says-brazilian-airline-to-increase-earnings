             Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA ,
Brazil’s largest airline by market value, gained for a sixth
day, its longest winning streak in eight months, as Raymond
James & Associates Inc. raised its rating on the stock, citing
“earnings momentum.”  
 Gol advanced 1.8 percent to 23.37 reais, while the Bovespa
stock index slipped 0.3 percent.  Tam SA , the second-biggest,
rose 1.3 percent to 28.05 reais. Gol was raised to
“outperform” from “underperform” at Raymond James, while Tam
was upgraded to “outperform” from “market perform.”  
 “Latin America, we believe, is the best airline market in
the world for investment because of its high growth,” wrote
analysts  James Parker  and  Duane Pfennigwerth  in a note to
clients. “Earnings momentum for both Gol and Tam is expected to
build considerably over the next several quarters.”  
 Gol sold $300 million of senior notes to yield 9.25
percent, according to a regulatory filing yesterday. The company
will use the proceeds to pay back debt due to mature in the next
three years.  
 Moody’s Investors Service said in a statement today that it
raised Gol’s corporate debt rating to Ba3 from B1, citing
improved operating performance and its debt issuance. The rating
outlook is stable, Moody’s said.  
 Tam said its board approved a plan to buy Tam Milor Taxi
Aereo, Representacoes, Marcas e Patentes SA for 169.9 million
reais ($96.5 million), according to a regulatory filing
yesterday.
