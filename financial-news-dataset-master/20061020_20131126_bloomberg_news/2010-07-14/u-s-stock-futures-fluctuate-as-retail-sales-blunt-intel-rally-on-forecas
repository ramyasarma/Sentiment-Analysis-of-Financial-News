             U.S. stock futures swung between
gains and losses as Intel Corp.’s profit forecast lifted
technology companies, offsetting declines in consumer companies
after a government report showed retail sales fell in June.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less
than 0.1 percent to 1,089.2 at 8:58 a.m. in New York after
rallying as much as 0.9 percent earlier.            
 “There’s a wrestling match between the macro activity,
which is weakening, and excellent execution by companies, which
are lean and mean and the business models are staring to work,”
said Michael Mullaney, who manages $9 billion at Fiduciary Trust
Co. in Boston.
