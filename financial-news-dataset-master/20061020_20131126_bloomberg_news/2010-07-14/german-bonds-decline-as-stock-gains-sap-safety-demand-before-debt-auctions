             German 10-year bund yields stayed
near the highest this week after a wave of securities auctions
across Europe fueled concern that supply will overwhelm demand
for government debt as the global economy recovers.  
 German five-year securities dropped as the country sold 4
billion euros ($5.1 billion) of debt at a higher yield. Italy’s
borrowing costs also rose at a sale of bonds maturing in 2040.
Greece led losses in so-called peripheral European bond markets,
a day after the country sold bills at an interest rate below the
5 percent charged in the European Union’s bailout.  
 “We are still positioned for bunds to be on the back
foot,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank in London. “The auctions
weren’t stars. They were average at best.”  
 The yield on the 10-year German bund increased one basis
point to 2.66 percent as of 4 p.m. in London. The 3 percent
security maturing in July 2020 fell 0.10, or 1 euro per 1,000-
euro face amount, to 102.96. The yield increased to 2.67 percent
earlier, the most since July 9. The yield has rebounded from a
record low of 2.5 percent on June 8.  
 Losses on Greek two-year notes pushed the yield up 36 basis
points to 9.86 percent. The 10-year yield increased six basis
points to 10.38 percent.  
 Greek Spread  
 The  extra yield  investors demand to hold Greek 10-year
securities instead of bunds of a similar maturity was at 759
basis points. The spread was 965 basis points on May 7, the most
since before the euro’s 1999 debut.  
 Greece triggered a crisis of confidence in Europe’s debt
market after Prime Minister  George Papandreou’s  socialist Pasok
party won elections in October and said the budget deficit was
more than 12 percent of gross domestic product, twice the
previous government’s estimate. That sparked a surge in bond
yields as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service cut
the nation’s ratings to below investment grade.  
 Portuguese 10-year bonds declined today, pushing the yield
up eight basis points to 5.61 percent. The nation sold 1.68
billion euros of bonds today, a higher amount than indicated by
the debt agency before the auction.  
 The country had its credit rating cut two levels to A1 at
Moody’s Investors Service yesterday on prospects for weak
economic growth and a growing debt burden.  
 The securities due June 2012 were issued at an average
yield of 3.159 percent, the debt agency said. That compares with
an average yield of 1.715 percent at previous auction of the
same-maturity debt on April 14. The auction attracted bids for
2.3 times the amount offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio
of 2.5 in April.  
 German, Italian Sales  
 The five-year securities sold by Germany today were priced
to yield an average 1.6 percent, compared with 1.47 percent at a
May 26 sale. Demand for the securities exceeded supply by 1.8
times, up from 1.1 times at the previous auction. The yield on
the 2.5 percent securities maturing in April 2015 increased
three basis points to 1.62 percent.  
 Italy sold about 6.8 billion euros of securities maturing
between 2015 and 2040. The 5 percent security maturing September
2040 was priced to yield an average 5.08 percent compared with
4.84 percent at a March 12 auction. The 2015 bonds yielded 2.85
percent at today’s sale, down from 2.91 percent in June.  
 The German 10-year yield has risen in the past week as some
investors bet gains stoked by the sovereign-debt crisis won’t be
sustained as the economic recovery gathers pace.  
 “There is a tendency from the outside to be excessively
pessimistic,” European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said at the press conference last week. “The figures
don’t confirm this pessimism.”  
 German debt has returned 6.7 percent so far this year,
compared with 5.3 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 6 percent for
U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts’ Societies. Greek
bonds lost 18 percent, the indexes show.
