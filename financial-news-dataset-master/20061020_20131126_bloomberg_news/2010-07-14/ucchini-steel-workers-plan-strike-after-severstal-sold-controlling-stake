             Lucchini SpA workers plan to strike
on July 22 after  OAO Severstal  sold a controlling stake in the
steel company to its Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Mordashov  in
preparation for offloading the business to an outside investor.  
 Workers at Piombino in Tuscany are “worried for the future
of the plant because of Mr. Mordashov’s disengagement and the
absence of an agreement with banks on debt restructuring,”
Italian labor unions Fiom-Cgil, Fim-Cisl and Uilm-Uil said in a
joint statement on their websites.  
 Severstal, which still owns a stake in Lucchini, said by e-
mail that the Italian company confirmed unions will hold a
gathering on July 22. Lucchini officials didn’t immediately
respond to calls to their office by Bloomberg News.
