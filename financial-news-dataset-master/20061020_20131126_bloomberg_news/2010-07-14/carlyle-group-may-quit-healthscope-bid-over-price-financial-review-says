             The Carlyle Group may exit the TPG-
led bidding group for Healthscope Ltd. due to disagreement over
pricing, the Australian Financial Review reported in its Street
Talk column, without saying where it got the information.  
 The consortium, which includes TPG, Blackstone Group LP and
Carlyle Group, is competing with Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts for
Healthscope, with final bids due tomorrow, the newspaper said.
