             Former Prime Minister  Gordon Brown  “repeatedly and often angrily” rejected Chancellor of 
the Exchequer  Alistair Darling ’s proposed economic forecasts,
telling him to bring back better ones, former Business Secretary
 Peter Mandelson  said in his memoirs.  
 The account supports the claim of the Conservative
government that Brown’s Labour administration changed forecasts
to suit policy, something Darling has denied.  George Osborne ,
who succeeded Darling as chancellor after Labour lost the
election in May, set up an Office for Budget Responsibility to
provide independent economic predictions.  
 As Darling prepared his April 2009 Budget, Brown told him
“the whole Treasury forecast was wrong and insisted that
orthodox methods couldn’t be applied to measuring the structural
deficit,” Mandelson wrote in his memoirs, “The Third Man,”
published today. Brown argued that taxes would pay down the
deficit once growth returned.  
 “Alistair told Gordon he was being ludicrously optimistic,
not only about growth prospects but about Britain’s ability to
support such a large, and expanding, deficit,” Mandelson wrote.
“Britain’s credit status might be downrated.”  
 In May 2009, a month after the Budget statement, Standard &
Poor’s put the U.K.’s AAA rating on negative outlook.
