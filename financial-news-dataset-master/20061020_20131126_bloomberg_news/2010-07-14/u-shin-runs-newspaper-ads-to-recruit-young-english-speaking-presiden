             U-Shin Ltd ., a Japanese manufacturer
that supplies  Volkswagen AG  and other carmakers, will run
newspaper advertisements seeking a young, English-speaking
president from outside the company.  
 “We are looking for someone aged 30 to 49 who can
negotiate directly with the top management of foreign
companies,” President  Koji Tanabe , who has headed Tokyo-based
U-Shin since 1978, said yesterday by telephone, confirming a
 report  in the Sankei newspaper.  
 Japanese companies typically promote top managers from
within their ranks. Exceptions include  Howard Stringer , who
spent more than 30 years in broadcasting in the U.S. before
joining Sony Corp., and Nissan Motor Co.’s  Carlos Ghosn , who was
recruited from Renault SA in 1999.  
 The job’s starting salary of 35 million yen ($394,000) may
be increased according to performance and the offer is open to
non-Japanese, Tanabe said. The ad will run in the morning
editions of the Yomiuri and Nikkei newspapers on July 25.  
 “Unfortunately, the seniority system remains strong in our
company and many of our elderly employees aren’t competitive,”
Tanabe, 76, said. “Also, there is no one who can speak English.
But I’m confident that we can find a good candidate through the
advertisement.”  
 U-shin, which has  posted  net losses in three of the past
five business years, forecasts a 2.5 billion yen profit for the
year ending Nov. 30 as it adds revenue from new customers. The
company, whose stock has climbed 54 percent this year, makes
components including car lock sets and keyless entry systems.
