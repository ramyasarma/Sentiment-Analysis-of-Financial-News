             China, the second-largest corn
consumer, may import at least 2.3 million metric tons in 2010 as
output lags behind demand, Bank of America-Merill Lynch said.  
 The country’s area planted to the grain may drop 1.5
percent and demand may expand 3.4 percent, Timothy Bush, a vice
president at Merill Lynch, said in Hong Kong today.
