             Cattle futures rose to an eight-week
high on signs that U.S. meat processors are paying more for
animals as profit gains. Hog prices jumped the most since April.  
 Slaughterhouses paid 93 cents a pound on average for  steers 
for immediate delivery this week, up 1.3 percent from a week
earlier and 12 percent more than a year earlier, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. Processors including Tyson Foods Inc.
and Cargill Inc. boosted  beef sales  in the first two days of the
week to 14.69 million pounds (6,663 metric tons), up 12 percent
from a year earlier, according to the USDA.  
 “Demand is stronger than the trade thought it was going to
be through the middle of the summer,” said  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.
“The packers have been keeping a profitable margin and will
continue to have some very good profit.”  
 Cattle futures for October delivery rose 1.125 cents, or
1.2 percent, to 93.4 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 93.7 cents, the highest
level for a most-active contract since May 14.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement were unchanged
at $1.13625 a pound.  
 Hog futures for October settlement rose 1.575 cents, or 2.1
percent, to 75.8 cents a pound, the biggest gain for a most-
active contract since April 30. The price has climbed 29 percent
in the past year after farmers reduced the breeding herd to the
smallest on record.
