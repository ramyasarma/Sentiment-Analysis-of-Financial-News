             Lincoln National Corp. , the insurer
that paid back a $950 million U.S. rescue, posted the  biggest
decline  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after Credit Suisse
Group AG downgraded the firm on the risk of impairment charges.  
 Lincoln  dropped  $1.45, or 5.7 percent, to $24.04 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading. Credit Suisse cut
the Philadelphia-based company to “neutral” from
“outperform,” a rating it had since June of last year.  
 “We see heightened risk of Lincoln realizing impairments”
tied to reserves, the cost of guaranteeing minimum returns for
clients, or goodwill, said  Thomas Gallagher , a New York-based
analyst at Credit Suisse, in a note today.  
 Lincoln repaid its government bailout in June through stock
and  bond offerings . Life insurers were cut off from traditional
sources of funding after stock and bond markets fell in late
2008, and at least 12 carriers applied to Treasury for bailouts.  
 Ten analysts tracked by Bloomberg advise buying Lincoln,
nine say hold, and one has a “sell” rating. The insurer has
slipped about 3.4 percent this year, compared with the 1.8
percent decline in the S&P 500.
