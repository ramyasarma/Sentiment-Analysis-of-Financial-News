             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  slid 47.25, or 0.2 percent, to 27,448.69 at 1:59
p.m. in Johannesburg after gaining 1.1 percent yesterday.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 Anglo Platinum Ltd.  (AMS SJ), the world’s biggest platinum
producer, dropped 11.50 rand, or 1.6 percent, to 725 rand,
heading for its biggest slide in a week. Platinum prices may
face months of declines, possibly losing more than $200 an ounce
with a “major reversal” under way, according to a technical
analysis from Commerzbank AG that cited trading patterns.  
 Cie Financiere Richemont SA  (CFR SJ), the world’s second-
largest luxury-goods maker, lost 56 cents, or 2 percent, to
28.20 rand, paring yesterday’s 2.5 percent gain. The world’s
biggest jewelry maker said its first-quarter sales continued the
“trend” seen in the period before Christmas, without
elaborating. The company commented today in its annual report,
repeating a statement it made with its full-year results.  
 Telkom South Africa Ltd.  (TKG SJ) fell for a sixth day,
sliding 26 cents, or 0.8 percent, to 33.30 rand. Africa’s
largest fixed-line phone company may lose more executives after
Chief Financial Officer  Peter Nelson  quit yesterday, Business
Day reported, citing an official at the company it didn’t
identify. Chief Executive Officer  Reuben September  stepped down
July 7, the company said earlier this month.
