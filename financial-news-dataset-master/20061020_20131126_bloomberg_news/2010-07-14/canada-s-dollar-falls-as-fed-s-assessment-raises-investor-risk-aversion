             Canada’s dollar fell from a three-
week high after the Federal Reserve noted increased risks to the
U.S. recovery, reducing the appeal of higher-returning assets.  
 The loonie, as the currency is known, weakened against its
U.S. counterpart by the most in two weeks as oil fell and
equities retreated from their highs for the day. Minutes from
the Fed’s June meeting showed that the economic outlook has
“softened.” Oil is Canada’s largest export, while the U.S. is
the nation’s biggest trading partner.  
 “The market in general reacted a little bit on the dovish
side and sent equities and the Canadian dollar back down,” said
 Steve Butler , director of foreign-exchange trading in Toronto at
Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada’s third-largest lender.  
 The currency weakened 0.4 percent to C$1.0338 per U.S.
dollar at 4:24 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0300 yesterday, when it
touched C$1.0277, the strongest level since June 23. One
Canadian dollar buys 96.73 U.S. cents.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which had rallied 7
percent over the previous six sessions, slipped 0.02 percent.
Crude oil fell 0.1 percent. The loonie tends to fluctuate with
equities and commodities as a proxy for risk.  
 The Fed lowered its forecast for 2010 growth to a range of
3 percent to 3.5 percent versus 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent in
April, the minutes show.  
 The Bank of Canada next meets July 20 to determine  interest
rates . Policy makers lifted the target lending rate on June 1 to
0.5 percent and said future moves would depend on the pace of
growth in Canada weighed against signs of an uneven global
recovery.  
 ‘Growing Risk’  
 “The U.S. outlook is clearly a growing risk for the Bank
of Canada,” said  Michael Gregory , a senior economist in Toronto
at Bank of Montreal, the nation’s fourth-largest lender.
“Trimming growth and inflation numbers is something the Bank of
Canada is probably doing internally, which we’ll see next
week.”  
 Employment rose by 93,200 in June, following gains of
24,700 in May and April’s record 108,700, Statistics Canada said
last week. The jobless rate fell to 7.9 percent, the least since
January 2009, from 8.1 percent.  
 “Domestic demand has that much more forward momentum,”
said Gregory, who predicts the central bank will raise rates by
0.25 percent. The global economy is “probably as worrisome as
back in June” when they increased the rate for the first time
since April 2009, he said.
