             South Korea’s won strengthened for
the first time in three days after Singapore reported better-
than-expected economic growth and a debt sale by Greece eased
concern Europe’s debt crisis will derail a global recovery.  
 Currencies and benchmark stock indexes advanced across the
region’s developing economies after Singapore reported
annualized growth of 26 percent for the second quarter, beating
the 23 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said he was
“satisfied” after the country sold Treasury bills at a lower
rate than the country pays for European aid.  
 “Greece’s successful bond issuance will pressure the won
to strengthen,” said  Park Jae Sung , a currency dealer at Woori
Investment & Securities. “That direction will gain momentum if
stocks gain. But the market is cautious of possible intervention
at 1,190 against the dollar.”  
 The won climbed 1 percent to 1,200 per dollar as of 9:42
a.m. in Seoul, after retreating 1.4 percent in the last two days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Park forecast the won
will trade between 1,190 and 1,200 today.  
 The  Kospi  index rose 1.3 percent, headed for a two-year
high, as overseas investors  bought  more Korean shares than they
sold for a fifth day. Equities were in demand after  Intel Corp. 
reported record second-quarter sales and  Posco , Asia’s third-
largest steelmaker, said second-quarter profit almost tripled.  
 Singapore’s government today raised its 2010 economic
growth forecast for the third time this year, predicting
expansion of as much as 15 percent. Its previous prediction was
for a maximum rate of 9 percent. South Korea last month boosted
its 2010 estimate to 5.8 percent, from a December projection of
5 percent.  
 South Korea’s government bonds fell. The yield on the 3.75
percent note due June 2013 rose three basis points to 3.99
percent, the highest level in four months for a benchmark three-
year  note . A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.

                          July 14 (Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li from Santa Clara, California, about the outlook for sales.
     Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, reported record second-quarter sales and topped analysts' estimates with its forecast for this period, allaying concern that a rebound in technology spending is losing steam. Smith also discusses the company's investments in China. (Source: Bloomberg)
