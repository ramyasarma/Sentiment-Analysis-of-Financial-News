             Cocoa futures rose the most in seven
months after a report today showed demand from European food
companies jumped the most in almost a decade.  
 Usage in the second quarter climbed 13 percent to 328,704
metric tons from a year earlier, data from the European Cocoa
Association showed. That’s the largest increase since the third
quarter of 2000.  
 “This is big,” said  Tom Mikulski , a senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “People are
worried about the supply situation in the short term.”  
 Cocoa for September delivery climbed $108, or 3.5 percent,
to $3,153 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the most since
Dec. 16. Earlier, the price reached $3,164, the highest level
for a most-active contract since May 7. The commodity has gained
16 percent in the past 12 months.  
 “Funds are probably behind the move and squeezing physical
buyers” out of the market, said  Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.  
 German cocoa-processing rose 11 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, the Association of the German
Confectionery Industry said today.  
 On the Liffe exchange in London, cocoa futures for
September delivery advanced 39 pounds, or 1.6 percent, to 2,436
pounds ($3,717) a ton.
