             Avexa Ltd.  climbed in Sydney trading
after the company said it entered into a licensing agreement in
China to develop a potential class of treatments for HIV.  
 Avexa  gained  12 percent to close at 3.7 Australian cents.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 1.9 percent.  
 The Melbourne-based drug developer will receive 50 percent
of revenue from the drugs in China under the agreement with
Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, which will bear
development costs in the country, Avexa said in a statement
today. Avexa retains all development and marketing rights
outside the China region, the company said.
