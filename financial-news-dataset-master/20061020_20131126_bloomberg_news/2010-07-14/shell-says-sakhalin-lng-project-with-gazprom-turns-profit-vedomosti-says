             Royal Dutch Shell Plc said its 
liquiefied natural gas venture with OAO Gazprom on Russia’s 
Sakhalin Island reached operational profitability, Vedomosti 
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser.  
 Shell is seeking licenses to produce oil in Russia, both by
itself and with domestic companies, Voser was cited as saying 
in an interview published in the Moscow-based newspaper today.  
 Voser also reiterated Shell’s interest in joining Russia’s 
second LNG project, run by OAO Novatek on the Yamal Peninsula 
in the Arctic, Vedomosti reported.
