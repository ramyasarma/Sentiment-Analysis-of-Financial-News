             Thousands of villagers in China’s
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region clashed with workers and
destroyed equipment at an aluminium plant that they say poisoned
their water and flooded 100 homes, the South China Morning Post
reported, citing Jingxi county officials.  
 The Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy said
yesterday more than 100 people were hurt in the clashes and at
least 10 vehicles were damaged by angry villagers, according to
the report.  
 The confrontation erupted on July 11 when the workers tried
to construct a road next to Lingwan, Jingxi county said in a
statement, according to the Morning Post.
