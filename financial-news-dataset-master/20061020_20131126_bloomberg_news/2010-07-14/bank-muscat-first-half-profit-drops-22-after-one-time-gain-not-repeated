             Bank Muscat SAOG , Oman’s biggest
bank by assets, reported an 87 percent rise in second-quarter
profit as it set aside less money to cover bad loans.
Profit still fell short of some analysts’ estimates.  
 Net income advanced to 22.5 million rials ($58.4 million)
from 12.02 million in the year-earlier period, according to
Bloomberg News’ calculations based on the bank’s first-half
results posted on the Muscat bourse today. National Bank of
Kuwait SAK  forecast earnings  of 36 million rials, while EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE said profit would be 26 million.  
 Bank Muscat set aside 20.7 million rials in the first half
to cover bad loans compared with 51.5 million rials a year
earlier, it said in the statement today. Gross loans rose 2
percent to 4.06 billion rials from a year ago, while customer
deposits advanced 11 percent to 3.6 billion rials.  
 Bank Muscat’s first-half profit fell 22 percent as a one-
time gain from the sale of its stake in India’s HDFC Bank Ltd.
last year wasn’t repeated. Net income fell to 47 million rials
from 60.4 million rials a year earlier.
