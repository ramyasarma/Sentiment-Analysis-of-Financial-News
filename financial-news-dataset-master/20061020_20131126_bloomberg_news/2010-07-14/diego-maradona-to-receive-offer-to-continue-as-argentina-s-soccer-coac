             Argentina’s soccer federation will

federation spokesman Ernesto Cherquis Bialo said at a news
conference in Buenos Aires province.  
 Maradona and federation President Julio Grondona are
expected to meet next week to discuss the offer, Cherquis Bialo
said today.  
 “There is no ‘Plan B’” for another person to take the
