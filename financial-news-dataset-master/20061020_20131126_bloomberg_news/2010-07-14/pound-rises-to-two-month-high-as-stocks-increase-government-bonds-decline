             The pound rose to its highest level
in more than two months against the dollar as British jobless
claims fell more than expected, boosting speculation the economy
may continue to strengthen as the government cuts spending.  
 Sterling gained against 13 of its 16 most-traded peers. The
number of people claiming jobless benefits in June fell by
20,800, the Office for National Statistics said, more than the
median forecast of 22 economists for a drop of 20,000. Bank of
England policy maker  Andrew Sentance  told the Reading Post
newspaper that officials need to start raising interest rates.
Britain sold 2.25 billion pounds ($3.4 billion) of 2046 bonds.  
 “The claimant count today has fallen for the fifth month
in a row, and that’s encouraging,” said  Chris Turner , head of
foreign-exchange research at ING Groep NV in London. “Maybe
there are some doubts emerging about how slow U.K. growth is
going to be this year.”  
 The pound gained as much as 0.7 percent to trade at
$1.5291, the strongest since May 3, and was at $1.5266 at 4:30
p.m. in London. The U.K. currency strengthened 0.3 percent to
83.58 pence per euro.  
 Sterling has gained 7.3 percent since reaching a low for
the year of $1.4231 on May 20, helped by confidence that the
coalition government formed after the May 6 election will reduce
the deficit without sending the nation back into recession. The
currency was boosted yesterday as data from the Office for
National Statistics showed consumer prices rose at a faster pace
than analysts estimated in June.  
 Inflation Hawks  
 UBS AG today scrapped its recommendation to sell the pound
against the dollar, as the U.K. currency had surpassed the
bank’s upper limit to protect against greater losses.  
 While the Bank of England last week held the benchmark rate
at a record low, Sentance last month made the first push to
raise rates in almost two years.  
 “Inflation still provides some support for the rogue hawks
on the Monetary Policy Committee,” ING’s Turner said today.  
 U.K. 30-year bonds fell, with the yield two basis points
higher at 4.21 percent, after the nation sold 4.25 percent
securities due in 2046 for an average yield of 4.17 percent.  
 Ten-year bonds yields were also two basis points higher at
3.40 percent.
