             A policeman and two militants were
killed when suspected al-Qaeda fighters attacked an intelligence
headquarters in southern Yemen, the ruling party website said.  
 About 20 al-Qaeda gunmen mounted the raid in the province
of Abyan,  almotamar.net  cited a local official as saying. The
militants were armed with grenades and assault rifles, said the
official. Seven suspects were later detained in Abyan, he said.  
 Five people died in twin assaults on the intelligence and
security service headquarters in the town of Zinjibar, Agence
France-Presse reported earlier, citing a Yemeni security
official. Those killed included three policemen and two
militants, AFP said.  
 The Yemen-based wing of al-Qaeda claimed responsibility
for a June 19 attack on the intelligence headquarters in the
nearby city of Aden that killed 11 people, including seven
security personnel.  
 Yemen, an impoverished Arabian Peninsula nation, has been
under U.S. pressure to crack down on al-Qaeda since the local
arm of the group claimed responsibility for a failed attempt to
blow up an American airliner on Dec. 25.
