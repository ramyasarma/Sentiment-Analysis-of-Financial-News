             Cotton futures fell to a five-month
low on forecasts for higher production and signs of weak retail
sales in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter. Orange juice
also dropped.  
 The U.S. cotton crop may be 50 percent bigger than last
year because farmers planted more and favorable growing
conditions are expected to improve yields, the Department of
Agriculture said last week.  Global output  will jump 13 percent
in the year starting Aug. 1, the USDA said. Sales at U.S.
retailers fell in June for a second month, government figures
showed today.  
 “U.S. production is doing very well,” said  Scott Joss ,
the president of ClearTrade Inc. in Chicago. “There’s no major
weather problem or anything. The pressure is on cotton to trend
lower.”  
 Cotton for December delivery fell 1.3 cents, or 1.7
percent, to 73.35 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price touched 73.21 cents, the lowest level for a
most-active contract since Feb. 12.  
 Based on chart patterns, today’s close below 73.55 cents
will “encourage shorts to move into the market and longs to
liquidate,” Joss said. “Prices may head down to 71.79 cents.”  
 Cotton has slipped 3 percent this year.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery dropped 2.8
cents, or 2 percent, to $1.3885 a pound in New York, halting a
two-day rally.
