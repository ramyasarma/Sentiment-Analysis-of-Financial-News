             ICAP Plc , the biggest broker of
transactions between banks, said first-quarter sales rose 8
percent from a year ago and that the range of analysts’ annual
profit forecasts “appears reasonable.” Shares fell.  
 Analysts are expecting profit before tax, amortization and
impairments, ICAP’s preferred measure, of 336 million pounds
($511 million) to 360 million pounds for the year ending March
2011, the London-based broker said. First-quarter pretax profit
rose 5 percent, ICAP said before its annual meeting today.  
 ICAP  fell as much as 5.6 percent to 411.7 pence, the
biggest drop in a month, after Chief Executive Officer  Michael Spencer  said trading slowed “significantly” in June as
investor risk appetite waned. The broker’s stock had risen 7.65
percent this month until yesterday and is now up 2.17 percent.  
 “The shares performed well in the run-up to the statement
and there may have been a feeling they would upgrade their
guidance,” said  Sarah Ing , an analyst at Singer Capital Markets
Ltd. in London. “They came out with a statement saying things
were good as expected and there doesn’t seem to be the momentum
for the shares to continue their run.”  
 The slowdown in June followed “buoyant levels of trading
activity in most financial markets during the first two
months,” benefiting ICAP, Spencer said in the statement.  
 ICAP has been  investing  to take advantage of regulatory
changes in its markets as authorities worldwide demand greater
transparency and more-efficient market infrastructure. The
company said it plans to focus on organic growth this year and
will also expand in Brazil.  
 Electronic broking on the company’s EBS and BrokerTec
currency and bond platforms increased 37 percent to $798 billion
a day on average in the quarter ended June 30. Fixed-income
transactions on BrokerTec rose 40 percent to $626 billion a day,
according to the statement.  
 ICAP was  trading  at 412.3 pence at 11:29 a.m. in London,
valuing the broker at 2.7 billion pounds. The stock has slipped
4.1 percent this year.
