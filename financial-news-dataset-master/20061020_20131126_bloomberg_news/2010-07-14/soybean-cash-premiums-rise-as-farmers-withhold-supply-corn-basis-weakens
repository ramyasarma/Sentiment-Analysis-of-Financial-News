             Cash premiums for soybeans shipped
to export terminals near New Orleans widened relative to Chicago
futures as the threat of crop damage this year discouraged
farmers from selling 2009 supplies. Corn premiums declined.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 92 cents to 98 cents a bushel above August futures,
compared with 81 cents to $1.02 yesterday, government  data  show.
The  average premium  is the highest since September. The corn
premium was 40 cents to 44 cents above September futures, down
from 42 cents to 45 cents.  
 “Soybeans are still hard to buy,” with U.S. inventories
on June 1 at the lowest level in six years, said  J.C. Hoyt , the
director of risk management for Cash Grain Bids Inc. in Bozeman,
Montana. Corn is becoming more available, after record corn
harvest last year. “Farmers are taking advantage of this rally
to clean out remaining supplies,” Hoyt said.  
 Soybean futures for August delivery rose 2.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $9.975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
fifth gain in six sessions, partly on concern that hot, dry
weather will damage crops in August. The price touched $10.09 on
July 12, the highest level for the contract since April 26. Last
week, the contract gained 5.2 percent, the most since October.  
 U.S. soybean inventories totaled 571 million bushels as of
June 1, down 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said on June 30. The reserve will drop
to 175 million bushels by Aug. 1, before this year’s harvest,
the USDA said.  
 Corn futures for September delivery jumped 9 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $3.8425 a bushel on the CBOT. The contract has
surged 15 percent since June 29, the day before the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said farmers planted less of the grain
this year than they had planned.
