             Inflation in Zimbabwe is expected to
slow to between 4 percent and 5 percent by year-end, Finance
Minister Tendai Biti said.  
 “Inflation rose to 6.1 percent in May, but we still think
that by year-end in December we’ll be able to contain it at
between 4 and 5 percent,” Biti said by phone today from the
capital, Harare. Inflation data for June should be released by
the country’s statistics office tomorrow, he said.
