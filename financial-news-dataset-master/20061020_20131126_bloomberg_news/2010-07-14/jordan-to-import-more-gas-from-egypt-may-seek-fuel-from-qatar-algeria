             Jordan ’s energy minister said the
country plans a nearly fourfold increase in natural gas imports
from Egypt and will explore purchases from Qatar and Algeria.  
 Jordan, which imports almost all its energy, is scheduled
to sign an agreement in two weeks that will raise gas supplies
for power plants to 330 million cubic meters from 240 million
cubic meters starting early 2011, Jordanian Energy Minister
 Khalid Irani  said today in an interview.  
 The countries also agreed to build a pipeline network to
bring 500 million cubic meters of Egyptian gas to feed houses
and industries in Jordan, Irani said.  
 Jordan started importing gas from Egypt in 2003, receiving
about 300 million cubic feet a day through a link across the
Gulf of Aqaba that also feeds Syria and Lebanon.  
 Egypt’s gas exports dropped by about 30 percent because
of technical faults in that country’s installations, Ghaleb
Maabreh, the general manager of Jordan’s  National Electric Power
Co ., said June 23.  
 Jordan’s electricity company reported a loss of 40 million
dinars ($56 million) after the Egyptian shortfall forced the
company to use heavy fuel oil, which is more expensive than
natural gas, he said.  
 Jordan, whose power use may double in 10 years, is also
considering importing gas from Qatar and Algeria, Irani said.
