             The Australian and New Zealand
dollars advanced to two-month highs as stocks gained in the
U.S., boosting investor appetite for riskier assets.  
 “We have a continuous risk-on environment with a good
acceleration in the stock market,” said  Fabian Eliasson , head
of U.S. currency sales at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New
York.  
 Australia’s currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 88.44 U.S.
cents at 12:48 p.m. in New York, from 88.33 cents yesterday. It
touched 88.71 cents, the highest level since May 14. New
Zealand’s dollar added 0.6 percent to 72.36 U.S. cents after
reaching 72.55 cents, the highest level since May 10.  
 U.S. stocks rose as Intel Corp.’s forecast of record yearly
profit bolstered confidence earnings growth will justify the
equity recent market’s rebound.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.2 percent after
earlier dropping 0.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
increased 0.2 percent.  
 The New Zealand dollar fell earlier as reports on housing
and retail sales raised concern the nation’s economic recovery
will be slower than anticipated.

                          July 14 (Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li from Santa Clara, California, about the outlook for sales.
     Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, reported record second-quarter sales and topped analysts' estimates with its forecast for this period, allaying concern that a rebound in technology spending is losing steam. Smith also discusses the company's investments in China. (Source: Bloomberg)
