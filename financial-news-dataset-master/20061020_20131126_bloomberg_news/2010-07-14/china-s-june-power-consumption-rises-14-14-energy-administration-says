             China’s power consumption rose at
the slowest pace since February because of weakening demand from
heavy industries, adding to signs that the economy leading the
world recovery is cooling.  
 Power use in the second-largest energy consuming nation
increased about 14 percent in June to 352 billion kilowatt-hours,
the National Energy Administration said today on its  website .
That compares with monthly growth of at least 20 percent from
March to May.  
 Today’s data follow weaker June readings for manufacturing
indexes and a measure of the services industry after the
government cracked down on property speculation and as the
effects of stimulus measures fade. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
earlier this month reduced its 2010 growth forecast for the
Chinese economy to 10.1 percent from 11.4 percent.  
 “The power numbers show a slight slowdown, primarily
because of slower manufacturing in China,”  Dave Dai , an analyst
at the Daiwa Institute of Research, said by phone from Hong Kong.  
 China’s first-half power consumption jumped 22 percent to
2.01 trillion kilowatt-hours, the administration said. The
country started operating 33.83 gigawatts of hydro and coal-
fired power plants in the first half, it said.  
 Power demand from industrial users rose 15.7 percent to
267.2 billion kilowatt-hours in June, compared with 23.3 percent
in May and 25.6 percent in April, according to the China
Electricity Council, which compiles monthly data for the energy
administration.
