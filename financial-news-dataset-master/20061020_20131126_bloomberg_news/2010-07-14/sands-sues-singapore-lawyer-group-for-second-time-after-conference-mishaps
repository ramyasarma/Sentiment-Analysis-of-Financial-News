             Las Vegas Sands Corp .’s Singapore
casino has filed a second lawsuit against a lawyers’ group that
refused to pay its bills for a May conference, even as both
sides discuss a settlement.  
 The latest suit comes after Sands Chairman  Sheldon Adelson 
said June 23 that he was ready to settle with the lawyers “any
day they want” and he would “rather make love than war.”  
 Marina Bay Sands Pte., a unit of Sands, is seeking
S$641,246 ($466,496) from IPBA 2010 Pte over unpaid bills,
according to a lawsuit filed with the Singapore High Court on
June 28. The organizer of the Inter-Pacific Bar Association
conference said in its June 8 lawsuit Sands misrepresented a
“complete disaster” as a world-class venue.  
 Sands, which hasn’t served the latest lawsuit, and IPBA met
for settlement talks late last week,  Yap Wai Ming , chairman of
IPBA’s organizing committee, said yesterday in an e-mailed
response to questions.  
 The casino resort has six months to formally turn over the
papers to IPBA, following which the law group will have eight
days to respond, according to court papers.  
 Lisa Williamson, a spokeswoman for Marina Bay Sands,
declined to comment.  
 IPBA paid S$200,000 of the S$841,245.75 bill, according to
court papers. Sands will deduct S$300,000 from its latest claim
if it manages to recover the amount from an earlier lawsuit, the
resort said in court papers.  
 ‘Limelight Again’  
 Sands  “wanted to see if we could resolve everything and
they would discontinue the actions later,” Yap said. “Once
they serve on us, we are obliged to respond and they may not
want this in the limelight again.”  
 Delegates at the conference complained of unfinished rooms,
power failures, closed facilities and lost luggage. The Bar
Association’s annual general meeting discussed an
“unprecedented” motion empowering it to sue Sands, according
to IPBA’s lawsuit.  
 Sands used the attendance of Singapore Minister Mentor  Lee Kuan Yew  at the event to speed up its casino permit, according
to the June 8 suit.  
 The conference, chaired by  Lee Suet Fern , daughter-in-law
of Lee Kuan Yew, was held May 2-5, only days after Las Vegas
Sands opened parts of the $5.5 billion resort. The resort was
originally scheduled to open at the end of 2009.  
 The case is Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd. v IPBA 2010 Singapore
Pte Ltd. S464/2010 in the Singapore High Court.
