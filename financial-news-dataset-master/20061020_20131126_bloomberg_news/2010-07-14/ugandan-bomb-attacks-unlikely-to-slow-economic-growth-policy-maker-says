             Bomb attacks in Uganda this week
that killed 74 people and injured dozens more are unlikely to
slow economic growth in the East African nation, said central
bank Deputy Governor  Louis Kasekende .  
 “This shouldn’t have a major impact on the economy,”
Kasekende said today in an interview in the Kenyan capital,
Nairobi. “We are monitoring and will use our forex store if
need be to intervene. But right now, we don’t see the need.”  
 The central bank currently has foreign currency reserves of
about $2.6 billion, Kasekende said. Uganda’s currency, the
shilling, which has weakened 17 percent against the dollar since
Nov. 17, has traded little changed since the bomb blasts.  
 Somalia’s Islamist al-Shabaab militia claimed
responsibility for two bomb attacks on July 11 in Kampala, the
Ugandan capital. The blasts occurred at separate venues where
crowds had gathered to watch the soccer World Cup final.  
 Uganda’s economic growth will accelerate to 6.4 percent in
the fiscal year through June 2011 and 7 percent the year after,
according to a  report  on the International Monetary Fund’s
website dated May 17. Economic growth was forecast at 5.6
percent in the 2009-10 financial year, the Washington-based
lender said.  
 Uganda, with a population of 31.9 million and a $16.6
billion economy, is the second-biggest coffee grower in Africa
after Ethiopia.
