             Ecopetrol SA , Colombia’s state-run
oil company, plans to invest $80 billion through 2020 to more
than double daily output to 1.3 million barrels of crude.  
 Colombia’s largest company reiterated that it plans to
produce 1 million barrels of oil daily in 2015, the Bogota-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 Ecopetrol is expanding its search for oil in Colombia,
Brazil, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Peru to meet its production
goals. Last month, the company won rights to explore domestic
blocks in a government auction.  
 Colombia aims to use its armed forces to help scout for new
reserves of oil, the commander of the armed forces said in an
interview July 12. South America’s third-largest oil producer
after Venezuela and Brazil is training a military unit to help
perform seismic testing to locate potential reserves, General
Freddy Padilla said.  
 Rising output at Ecopetrol will help increase overall
production in Colombia to 1 million barrels a day by next year,
according to the nation’s Mines and Energy Ministry.  
 Ecopetrol produced an average of 586,400 barrels of oil per
day in the first quarter. In May, all companies in Colombia
produced 764,000 barrels daily, according to government figures.  
 Ecopetrol rose  0.5 percent to 2,875 pesos at 9:14 a.m.
local time. The stock has climbed 16 percent this year.
