             European Union carbon permits fell
to their cheapest level in three months, taking their relative
strength index to a 17-month low, before a key vote on a
regulation setting rules for auctions of allowances from 2013.  
 EU permits for December lost as much as 0.7 percent to
13.75 euros ($17.49) a metric ton, the lowest level since April
14. They traded at 13.95 euros as of 8:52 a.m. on London’s
European Climate Exchange, below a 200-day moving average of
14.10 euros.  
 The contract’s 14-day relative strength index, a measure of
the speed of price changes, dropped to as low as 27.9 today, the
weakest level since Feb. 17, 2009. Readings above 70 indicate a
price may be poised to fall, and readings below 30 indicate it
may be poised to rise  
 The EU’s 27 member states are divided over a regulation on
carbon auctions before today’s vote in the climate change
committee, composed of national experts and chaired by the
European Commission, the bloc’s regulator.  
 The  EU , which has given away most of its emission
allowances for free, will start selling a majority of them after
2012. The commission wants to give governments a possibility of
having their own auctioning platforms to run alongside a central
platform for the bloc, according to a draft document obtained by
Bloomberg News.  
 The procedure to approve and list a national platform is
the “only major aspect standing in the way of a successful
vote,”  Jos Delbeke , director general for climate at the
commission, said earlier this month.  
 The U.K. and Germany, Poland and Spain have already
expressed preferences for individual auctions. The U.K.
government said last week the commission’s proposal “imposes a
set of discriminatory rules” and makes the option of running a
national platform “essentially unviable.”
