             Credit Suisse Group AG ’s offices in
Germany were searched today in a probe into allegations that its
employees may have helped clients evade taxes.  
 Thirteen Credit Suisse (Deutschland) AG locations were
raided as part of the investigation,  Johannes Mocken , spokesman
for the Dusseldorf prosecutors’ office, said in a phone
interview. Investigators seized substantial amounts of data
during the day, Mocken said.  
 “There is a lot of material to go through, so we won’t be
able to finish all searches today,” said Mocken. “At least in
the Frankfurt Credit Suisse offices, we will have to continue to
work tomorrow.”  
 Germany has been rattled by probes that showed people hid
assets in accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein to avoid
paying taxes. Former  Deutsche Post AG  Chief Executive Officer
 Klaus Zumwinkel  in January received a two-year suspended
sentence and must pay a 1 million-euro ($1.27 million) penalty
for avoiding about 970,000 euros in taxes.  
 German government officials bought disks containing bank
data that have helped them locate possible tax evaders. The
purchases stirred debate over whether it is legitimate to
acquire data that must have been stolen from the banks and use
it for law enforcement.  
 Data Disk  
 The case that prompted today’s raids began after German
authorities obtained a disk with data that prompted probes
against some 1,100 customers of Zurich-based Credit Suisse,
Switzerland’s second-biggest bank. Dusseldorf prosecutors are
investigating 175 cases, including some against Credit Suisse
employees. The rest of the cases were referred to other
prosecutors based on where the suspects live.  
 The bank is cooperating with the authorities, Credit Suisse
spokesman  Bjoern Korschinowski  said by telephone. He declined to
comment further because the probe is ongoing.  
 The searches were authorized by a Dusseldorf court, which
held that there is evidence to suggest Credit Suisse employees
may have helped clients evade government levies. No suspects
have been identified yet, according to the statement. About 150
investigators took part in the raids.  
 UBS AG , the largest Swiss bank, avoided prosecution in the
U.S. last year by admitting it helped clients evade taxes from
2000 to 2007. The bank paid a $780 million penalty and agreed to
disclose the secret account data for more than 4,700 clients.  
 Seventeen UBS clients, two bankers and three alleged
enablers of tax crimes have been charged since the bank signed
the deferred-prosecution agreement. Another 15,000 U.S.
residents sought to avoid prosecutions last year by disclosing
offshore accounts.
