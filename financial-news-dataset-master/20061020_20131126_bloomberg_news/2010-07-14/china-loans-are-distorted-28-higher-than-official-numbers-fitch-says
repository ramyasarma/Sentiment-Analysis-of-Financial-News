             Chinese  bank lending  in the first
half was 28 percent higher than official numbers suggest as more
loans were repackaged into investment products, “distorting”
credit data, Fitch Ratings said.  
 After adjusting for “informal securitization,” new loans
stood at about 5.9 trillion yuan ($871 billion) in the first six
months, topping People’s Bank of China data of about 4.6
trillion yuan posted this month, Fitch said in a statement today.  
 The central bank said last week that money and loan growth
in the first half was “reasonable” after banks awarded a
record 9.59 trillion yuan of lending last year. China’s policy
makers have ordered banks to limit  new credit  at 7.5 trillion
yuan this year to alleviate the threat of  asset-price bubbles .  
 At the end of June, more than 2.3 trillion yuan in
outstanding credit was in investment products and off the
balance sheets of Chinese banks, Fitch estimated in today’s
release, up more than ten-fold from the end of 2007.  
 Credit-backed investment products are “frequently marketed
as substitutes for bank deposits, and investors commonly believe
there is an implicit commitment from banks to repay investors
upon maturity,” Fitch said. “These implicit obligations
currently are not included in financial statements, and
represent a hidden call on liquidity.”  
 China Banking Regulatory Commission  placed a temporary ban
on “informal securitization” earlier this month, according to
Fitch.
