             U.S. stock-index futures rose as a
report showed retail sales increased in June excluding
automobiles and gasoline and Intel Corp. boosted its profit
forecast for the year.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September rose 0.2 percent to 1,091.9 at 8:33 a.m. in New York.
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased 0.2 percent to
10,313.  
 Excluding autos, gasoline and building materials, which are
the figures used to calculate gross domestic product, sales rose
0.2 percent after a 0.2 percent decrease the prior month, the
Commerce Department said.  
 Futures pared gains earlier after mortgage applications
fell to the lowest level in more than 13 years. The Mortgage
Bankers Association’s index decreased 2.9 percent in the week
ended July 9, the Washington-based group reported today. The
association’s purchase index declined 3.1 percent to the lowest
level since December 1996 and the refinancing gauge fell 2.9
percent after reaching its highest level since May 2009.  
 The S&P 500 has rebounded more than 7 percent from a 10-
month low on July 2, paring its drop for the year to 1.8
percent, amid optimism that second-quarter earnings will
overshadow disappointing home sales, manufacturing and jobs
data. Analysts predict earnings in the S&P 500 grew 34 percent
last quarter, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The S&P 500 plunged 16 percent between April 23 and July 2,
reaching its lowest valuation relative to earnings in a year, on
concern a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe is spreading and
economic growth in China and the U.S. is slowing. The benchmark
gauge closed up 1.5 percent yesterday, a sixth day of gains and
the longest winning streak since April 15.
