             Some of the flow of oil from  BP
Plc ’s Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico has been stopped as the
company prepares to begin a pressure test.  
 The company will close valves to raise the pressure inside
the well in six-hour intervals. The test will determine whether
a containment cap can remain in place without causing the well
to burst open elsewhere.  
 “This is an important test,” BP Senior Vice President
Kent Wells told reporters on the call today. “We’re proceeding
with overabundance of caution,”  
 BP may require 48 hours of test data to determine whether
it can safely seal the leak and stop the spill, which began
after an April 20 rig explosion.  
 The procedure was delayed more than 24 hours after Energy
Secretary  Steven Chu  and a team of experts said more analysis
was needed, National Incident Commander  Thad Allen  said. Wells
said earlier today the delay also pushed back the schedule for a
relief well being drilled to plug the well by a day or two.  
 The Macondo well has been leaking as much as 60,000 barrels
of oil a day, according to a government estimate, since the
drilling-rig blast that killed 11 workers.
