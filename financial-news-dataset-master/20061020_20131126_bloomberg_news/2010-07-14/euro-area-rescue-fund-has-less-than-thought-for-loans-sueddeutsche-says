             The euro-area rescue fund can
provide fewer loans than originally thought because rating
agencies require guarantees that exceed the size of the credit
volume, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported, citing a document from
the German government it obtained.  
 Members of the euro area can lend each other as much as 366
billion euros rather than the anticipated 440 billion euros, the
newspaper said, citing the document. Rating agencies require the
16 euro countries to provide as much as 20 percent more
guarantees than the actual loan amount, Sueddeutsche said.
