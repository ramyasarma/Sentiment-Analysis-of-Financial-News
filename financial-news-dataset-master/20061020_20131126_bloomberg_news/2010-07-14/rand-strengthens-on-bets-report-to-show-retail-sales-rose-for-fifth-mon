             South Africa’s rand strengthened to
a 2 1/2-week high against the dollar before a report that is
expected to show retail sales rose for a fifth month as a
recovery in Africa’s biggest economy gains momentum.  
 The currency appreciated for a second day, gaining as much
as 0.4 percent to 7.5086 per dollar, the strongest since June
24, and traded 0.1 percent up at 7.5262 by 10a.m. in
Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.5355.  
 Retail  sales probably rose an annual 3.7 percent in May
after increasing 3.2 percent the previous month, according to
the  median estimate  of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Pretoria-based  Statistics South Africa  is scheduled to release
the data at 11:30 a.m. local time.  
 “We should see an increase in retail sales but off of a
very low base,” said  Ian Cruickshanks , head of research at
Nedbank Treasury in Johannesburg. “The consumer side of the
economy is recovering but quite slowly.”  
 Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of South
Africa’s economy, has been slow to rebound from last year’s
recession, which caused 870,000 job losses. Sales have gradually
improved after the central bank lowered its benchmark rate by
5.5 percentage points since the end of 2008 to boost growth.  
 Government bonds rose for a seventh day, with the benchmark
13.5 percent security due September 2015 gaining 12 cents to
124.51 rand. The yield on the bond fell 3 basis points to 7.65
percent.  
 Investors increased bets that South Africa’s central bank
may lower its 6.5 percent benchmark interest rate when it next
meets on July 22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of
 three-month contracts  for cash in three months fell 1 basis
point to 6.28 percent, the lowest since the central bank first
introduced its repurchase rate in 1999.
