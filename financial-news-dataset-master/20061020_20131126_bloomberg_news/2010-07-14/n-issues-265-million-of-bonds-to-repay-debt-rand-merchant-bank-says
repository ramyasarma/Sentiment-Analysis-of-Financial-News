             MTN Group Ltd. , Africa’s biggest
mobile-phone operator, sold 2 billion rand ($265 million) of
bonds to repay existing debt, Rand Merchant Bank, which arranged
the sale with  Standard Bank Group Ltd. , said in an e-mail.  
 The Johannesburg-based company sold 750 million rand of
9.36 percent notes due July 2015 yesterday that were priced to
yield 1.57 percent above South Africa’s benchmark 13.5 percent
government bond, Barry Martin, co-head of debt capital markets
at RMB, said by telephone. MTN issued a further 1.25 billion
rand of 10.13 percent bonds due July 2017 at a spread of 1.69
percent above the government bond of similar maturity, he said.  
 “The credit spreads were at the low end and on some
instruments tighter than the price guidance provided to
investors ahead of the auctions, which is an indication of
strong investor support for MTN,” Andrew Costa, head of debt
capital markets at Standard Bank, said in the statement.  
 The sale followed an auction of 1.5 billion rand of notes
by MTN last week and forms part of a 10 billion-rand note
program registered with the JSE Ltd., which runs South Africa’s
bond and stock exchanges, RMB said in the e-mail.
