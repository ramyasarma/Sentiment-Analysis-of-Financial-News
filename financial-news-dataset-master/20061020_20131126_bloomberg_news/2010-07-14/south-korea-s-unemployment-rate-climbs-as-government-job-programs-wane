             South Korea’s  unemployment rate  rose
for the first time in five months in June as government
employment programs began to wind down.  
 The jobless rate climbed to 3.5 percent from 3.2 percent in
May, which was the lowest level since October 2008, Statistics
Korea said today in Gwacheon, citing seasonally adjusted figures.
The rate hit a 10-year high of 4.8 percent in January.  
 South Korea last week joined India, Malaysia and Taiwan in
raising interest rates as a recovering economy threatens to
stoke inflation. The central bank this week boosted its 2010
economic growth and inflation projections, supporting the case
for further increases in borrowing costs.  
 “Policy makers will closely watch if the economy can
sustain its momentum amid Europe’s debt crisis before making
their next move,” said  Lee Sang Jae , a senior economist at
Hyundai Securities Co. in Seoul. “The key is how much local
demand will recover as exports remain strong.”  
 The unadjusted  jobless rate  was 3.5 percent in June,
compared with 3.2 percent in May, today’s report showed. The
number of employed people increased by 314,000 to 24.28 million
last month from a year ago.  
 ‘Private Sector’  
 “The private sector is leading the job market recovery,”
Finance Minister  Yoon Jeung Hyun  said at a ministerial meeting
in Gwacheon today. “Strong economic growth forced the central
bank to raise the interest rate last Friday. They will decide
the pace and scope of further rate increases after considering
various factors.”  
 The economy will expand 5.9 percent in 2010, more than the
5.2 percent predicted in April, the central bank said this week.
It trimmed the estimate for next year to 4.5 percent from a
previous 4.8 percent.  
 Bank of Korea Governor  Kim Choong Soo  said yesterday that
Asian nations are focusing on promoting domestic demand,
consumption and investment as the global economy isn’t growing
strongly.  
 The Finance Ministry said June 24 that South Korea’s
economy may add 300,000 jobs this year, more than its previous
forecast of 250,000 jobs, after shedding 72,000 last year. The
annual jobless rate will be 3.7 percent, it said.  
 The won closed 0.9 percent lower at 1,212.30 per dollar in
Seoul yesterday, the biggest decline since June 29, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It has retreated 3.9 percent so far
this year, Asia’s worst performance.  
 The number of people self-employed or working in the
public-service sector rose 2.3 percent and hiring in the
manufacturing sector climbed 4.7 percent, today’s report showed.
People employed in the construction industry increased 3.8
percent from a year earlier, while jobs in the agricultural,
fishery and forestry sectors declined 2.1 percent.
