             Hungary’s Cabinet will today discuss
the European Central Bank’s stance on the government’s plan to
cut  Magyar Nemzeti Bank  President  Andras Simor ’s salary, MTI
reported, citing government spokesman Peter Szijjarto.  
 The ECB this week said the plan to cut Simor’s salary by 75
percent threatened to undermine the bank’s independence and a
salary reduction should only be applied to his successors.
