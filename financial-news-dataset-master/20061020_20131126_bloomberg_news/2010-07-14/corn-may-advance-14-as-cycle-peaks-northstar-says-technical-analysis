             Corn prices are likely to rise 14
percent before the start of the U.S. harvest in September, when
the 40-week cash-price cycle will peak, according to  Mark Schultz  at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.  
 Global consumption of feed grains including corn, sorghum
and barley will exceed production for a second straight year,
said Schultz, a chief analyst for the Minneapolis-based broker
and consultant.  
 The 40-week cycle in cash-corn prices in central Illinois
reached its most-recent trough on June 30. The day before, the
Department of Agriculture said U.S. farmers planted less than
they had intended this year and indicated usage of corn rose 26
percent during the quarter that ended May 31.  
 “This rally will not be driven by a U.S. supply problem,”
Schultz said. “This rally will be about rising global demand”
for food, animal feed and fuel made from corn.  
 China’s corn production likely will lag behind demand after
planting dropped 1.5 percent and demand increases by at least 3
percent this year, Schultz said. China is poised to become a net
corn importer in the marketing year ending Sept. 30 for the
first time in at least 14 years after drought parched crops last
year, the USDA has said.  
 “Chinese demand for imports is going to be stronger than
people expect,” Schultz said. “Any additional weather problems
in the U.S. or China” could push up cash prices as much as 21
percent at cycle’s peak, Schultz said.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 9.25 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $3.9625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest gain since July 7.
