             Benin dismissed and arrested
Security Minister  Armand Zinzindohoue  for his involvement in a
finance company that took deposits from people and hasn’t
returned the funds, Work Minister Gerard Kuassi said.  
 President  Thomas Boni Yayi  on July 8 fired Zinzindohoue,
who was arrested yesterday after a commission of inquiry found
he was involved in the company, known as ICC Services, Kuassi
told reporters in Cotonou, the country’s commercial hub, today.  
 ICC Services, which was set up to provide funds to women
who own small businesses, hasn’t paid interest on deposits since
May, Kuassi said.  
 ICC Services Director General Emile Tegbenou told members
of the commission that Zinzindohoue received money to facilitate
the company’s activities, Kuassi said. Tegbenou has been jailed
in a prison in Cotonou.  
 ICC Services’s banking account has been blocked and a
committee led by Development Minister  Pascal Irenee Koupaki  will
is investigating the company and determining how to pay back
depositors.
