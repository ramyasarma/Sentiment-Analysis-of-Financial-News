             Spain and the Netherlands, which met
in the World Cup final, moved past record five-time world
champion Brazil to the top of FIFA’s world soccer rankings.  
 Spain moved up one place to the  top ranking , while the
Netherlands jumped two spots. Brazil, which lost to the Dutch in
the quarterfinals in South Africa, is third.  
 Five of the top 10 slots are held by European teams, with
No. 4 Germany, a surprise semifinalist, seventh-ranked England
and Portugal, which dropped five places to eighth. Argentina is
fifth, with Uruguay, the only non-European team to make the
semifinals, rising 10 spots to sixth. That’s the highest-ever
ranking for Uruguay, which along with No. 9 Egypt and 10th-
ranked Chile was the biggest riser in the top 10.  
 “These three teams have benefited from disappointing
performances by two giants of international football, Italy
(11th, down 6) and France (21st, down 12),” FIFA said today in
a statement. “The 2006 finalists pay the price for group-stage
elimination in South Africa and, together with Croatia, no
longer find themselves among the 10 best teams.”  
 Chile rose eight spots and Egypt gained three. Italy and
France didn’t reach the knockout stages after failing to win any
matches at the World Cup, which Spain won in a 1-0 victory over
the Netherlands on July 11. Brazil was beaten 2-1 by the Dutch
in the quarterfinals.  
 Croatia dropped five spots to 15th, while Greece in 12th,
and the U.S., tied with Serbia in 13th, rose one place each.
Paraguay, which lost to Spain in the quarterfinals, and Peru
were the biggest gainers in the top 50, rising 15 spots to No.
16 and No. 38, respectively. Peru didn’t qualify for the World
Cup.  
 South Africa, the host of the tournament, rose 17 spots to
66th while Ghana, which lost to Uruguay in the quarterfinals,
was up nine places to 23rd. Nigeria fell 9 spots to 30th, and
Cameroon declined 21 places to 40th.
