             Asian borrowers may sell a record
amount of bonds in dollars this year as concern fades that
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis will slow global economic growth,
according to  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc .  
 Sales started the year “like a house on fire” before
hitting “a bit of a wall” after Greece’s credit rating was cut,
 John Wade , the bank’s head of primary debt markets for Asia-
Pacific, said at a briefing in Singapore yesterday. As stress
tests on European banks calm investors “we might even be able
to challenge last year’s record,” he said.  
 Sales of bonds denominated in dollars, euros or yen in Asia
outside Japan jumped to a record $56.7 billion last year from
$16.3 billion in 2008 and $37.9 billion in 2007 as bank lending
slowed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies and
governments raised $30.2 billion this year, the data show.  
 The International Monetary Fund this month raised its
forecast for global growth in 2010 to 4.6 percent, the biggest
gain since 2007, compared with an April projection of 4.2
percent. European regulators are examining the strength of the
region’s banks to determine if they can survive potential losses
on sovereign-bond holdings and are counting on the stress tests
to reassure investors about the health of financial institutions.  
 Sale Pipeline  
 Money managers outside Asia are “getting comfortable”
with the region and there’s a “large pipeline” of bond sales
awaiting the right market conditions, Wade said.  
 So-called G3 currency sales this month rose to $3.3 billion
compared with $2.5 billion in June and $3.2 billion in May,
Bloomberg data show. Woori Bank, State Bank of India and  PTT
Exploration & Production Pcl  either sold or started marketing
dollar bond sales yesterday.  
 RBS is ranked the No. 14 underwriter of G3 currency sales
in Asia outside Japan this year with a 2.8 percent market share,
according to Bloomberg data. Market leader Deutsche Bank AG has
a 13.9 percent share.  
 “It’s not just financial institutions and high-yields,”
planning sales, Wade said. “Some sovereigns are thinking of
coming back to the market and Korean corporates are always
coming as they have massive dollar funding requirements.”  
 When  Korea Exchange Bank  sold $500 million of 4.875 percent
bonds on July 7 it received more than $2 billion in orders from
195 accounts, a person familiar with the matter said at the time.  
 Woori Bank, a unit of South Korea’s third-largest financial
institution by market value, sold $600 million of 4.75 percent
bonds yesterday priced to yield 300 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  
 The bonds, sold at 99.356 cents on the dollar, were trading
at 99.432 cents as of 9:50 a.m. in Singapore, according to RBS.
