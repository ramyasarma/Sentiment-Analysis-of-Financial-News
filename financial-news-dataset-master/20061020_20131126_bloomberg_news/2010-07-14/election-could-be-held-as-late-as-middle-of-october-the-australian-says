             Prime Minister Julia Gillard may not
hold an election until as late as mid-October, the Australian
said without citing anyone.  
 Gillard convened a strategy meeting this week to examine
all possible dates for an election until the end of the year,
the newspaper said. The most likely dates are the end of August
or the middle of September, the newspaper said.  
 Local media have speculated that Gillard could as early as
this week dissolve parliament and call an election.
