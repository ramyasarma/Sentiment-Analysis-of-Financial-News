             U.S. stocks rose, extending the
longest rally for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since 2006, as
Intel Corp.’s forecast of record yearly profit bolstered
confidence earnings growth will justify the market’s rebound.  
 Intel jumped 3.3 percent as technology companies led the
S&P 500 to a seventh straight advance. Cisco Systems Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Microsoft Corp. climbed more than 1.2
percent to help lead gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  
 The  S&P 500  climbed 0.2 percent to 1,097.64 as of 12:09
p.m. in New York, its seventh straight advance. The gauge has
rallied more than 7 percent from a 10-month low on July 2. The
 Dow average  increased 20.28 points, or 0.2 percent, to
10,383.30.  
 “Intel has reach over both consumer and investment
spending, and also has reach throughout the world,” said
 William Greiner , president and chief investment officer of Scout
Investment Advisors in Kansas City, which manages $7.5 billion.
Its results show that “businesses in general are making the
leap toward investment spending. It’s positive from the
standpoint of stock prices being fundamentally undervalued” on
a historical basis relative to profits.  
 Benchmark indexes retreated earlier as a second straight
month of declines in retail sales indicated the economic
recovery moderated heading into the second half of 2010.  
 S&P 500 Rebounds  
 The S&P 500 rebounded from a 10-month low on July 2, paring
its drop for the year to 1.8 percent as of yesterday, amid
optimism that second-quarter earnings will overshadow
disappointing home sales, manufacturing and jobs data. Analysts
predict earnings in the S&P 500 grew 34 percent last quarter,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The  S&P 500  plunged 16 percent between April 23 and July 2,
reaching its lowest valuation relative to earnings in a year, on
concern a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe is spreading and
economic growth in China and the U.S. is slowing.
      Intel  gained 3.3 percent to $21.71 for the biggest advance
in the Dow average. The company, whose processors run more than
80 percent of the world’s personal computers, reported record
second-quarter sales and topped analysts’ estimates with its
forecast for the current period, allaying concern that a rebound
in technology spending is losing steam.  
 Third-quarter sales will be $11.6 billion, plus or minus
$400 million, the Santa Clara, California-based company said
after the market closed yesterday. Analysts had estimated $10.9
billion on average, according to a Bloomberg survey. Intel said
its gross profit margin will reach 66 percent this year, while
its second-quarter earnings also topped estimates.  
 AMD, Nvidia  
 Advanced Micro Devices , which is due to report profit
tomorrow, gained 1.1 percent to $7.61.  Nvidia , the second-
largest maker of graphics chips, rose 1.1 percent to $11.04.  
 Other technology companies also helped boost the Dow. Cisco
Systems rose 3 percent to $23.78. Hewlett-Packard gained 2.4
percent to $47.88, and Microsoft Corp. advanced 1.4 percent to
$25.48.  
 U.S. stock-index futures rose as much as 0.9 percent before
exchanges opened. The gains began to erode after weekly data
from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed requests for
purchase financing dropped to the lowest level in more than 13
years.  
 Futures extended their declines after the retail sales
report. Purchases decreased 0.5 percent, more than expected,
following a 1.1 percent May drop, the Commerce Department said.
Excluding auto dealers, demand fell 0.1 percent, matching the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Target, Home Depot  
 Target, the second-biggest U.S. discount retailer, fell 0.8
percent to $49.51. Home Depot, the largest U.S. home-improvement
retailer, dropped 0.6 percent to $28.48.  
 Yum! Brands Inc.  declined 2 percent to $40.69. The owner of
the KFC and Taco Bell restaurant chains boosted its fiscal-year
2010 per-share profit forecast to $2.43 after markets closed
yesterday, falling short of the $2.48 expected by analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 Expeditors International of Washington Inc.  rose 5.2
percent to $39.10 for the biggest gain in the S&P 500. The
manager of cargo ships said second-quarter profit was at least
38 cents a share, topping the 31-cent average analyst estimate.
