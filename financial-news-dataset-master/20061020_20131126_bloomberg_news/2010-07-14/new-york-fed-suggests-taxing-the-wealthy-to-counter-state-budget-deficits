             Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
researchers said states facing budget deficits should consider
temporarily raising income taxes on their wealthiest residents
and relying more on sales taxes to make up the shortfalls.  
 In a  report  issued today focusing on the recession’s impact
on the budgets of  New York  and  New Jersey , the Fed branch also
recommended the states create “rainy day” funds to protect
against future revenue gaps, plan in advance for spending cuts
and reduce reliance on personal income taxes, which are affected
by changes in the economy.  
 “One approach to smoothing revenue streams is to reduce
reliance on cyclically sensitive tax bases and raise revenues
from less-volatile sources, notably sales taxes,” wrote  Richard Deitz , Andrew Haughwout and  Charles Steindel , the co-authors of
the report.  
 “Temporarily raising income taxes on high-income
households during a downturn” would have the advantage of
placing “a larger burden on households that are less liquidity-
constrained,” they said. The tax would be removed once the
economy begins to improve.  
 In New York, Governor  David Paterson  and the Legislature
have failed to enact a budget due April 1 as the administration
and lawmakers battle over spending cuts to close a $9.2 billion
gap in its $130 billion spending plan. New Jersey Governor
 Christopher Christie  has struggled with a record $11 billion
deficit in that state’s $29.4 billion budget.  
 Tax Surcharges  
 New York enacted temporary tax surcharges in 2003 and 2009
that boosted rates on households with incomes of more than
$300,000. Paterson and state Senate leaders have opposed higher
taxes on the wealthy in future budgets.  
 New Jersey’s Democratic lawmakers in May unsuccessfully
sought an income-tax surcharge on residents earning at least $1
million a year. The plan was opposed by Republican Christie, who
insisted upon spending limits.  
 Across the U.S.,  states have reduced spending  by $74
billion since 2008 and more than half raised taxes and fees in
2009, the  National Association of State Budget Officers  has
reported.  
 In Nevada, the worst economy since the 1930s produced a May
unemployment rate of 14 percent, surpassing the 9.5 percent U.S.
rate, and falling home values led to a 12 percent revenue
decline of $95 billion between September 2008 and year-end 2009,
according to the U.S.  Census Bureau .  
 Stimulus Money  
 Federal economic stimulus aid helped close an estimated
$162.5 billion in budget gaps among the 50 states in 2010, the
report stated, citing a study by the  Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities , a Washington-based policy research group. In May,
the center anticipated additional state deficits of at least
$112 billion for the 2011 fiscal year, according to the report.  
 “This fiscal stress has been particularly acute in states
that have relied heavily on tax revenues from economic sectors
hit hard by the recession,” such as the financial industry, the
Fed report stated. “As the financial crisis took hold, however,
tax revenues from this industry dropped rapidly, contributing to
the emergence of large budget holes in both states.”  
 The New York Fed is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that,
along with the Board of Governors, comprise the U.S. Federal
Reserve System.
