             Paint makers  Sherwin-Williams Co.
and  Valspar Corp.  fell in New York after analysts downgraded the
shares amid concerns that earnings will be hurt by a weak U.S.
housing market and raw-material shortages.  
 Sherwin-Williams , based in Cleveland, dropped $1.97, or 2.7
percent, to $71.25 as of 11:11 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Valspar, based in Minneapolis, declined
$1.12, or 3.4 percent, to $31.41.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by  Robert Koort 
issued a report today cutting Sherwin-Williams, the biggest U.S.
paint retailer, to “sell” from “neutral” because of
potential slowing economic growth in the second half and “a
cautious view on U.S. housing.” Koort, based in Houston, cut
his price target on the shares to $71 from $77.  
 Paint makers are raising prices as they try to overcome
shortages of ingredients such as  acrylic  and  titanium dioxide .
Gains in paint sales slowed in June at Lowe’s Cos. stores partly
because raw-material shortages have reduced the availability of
some Valspar products, said Longbow Research analyst  Dmitry Silversteyn .  
 “We are growing increasingly concerned with lost volumes
due to raw-material shortages, high prices of scarce raw
materials and the possible need for Valspar to build inventory
of high-priced raw materials, all of which may depress gross
margins below our previous expectations,” Silversteyn said
today in a report.  
 Silversteyn downgraded shares of Valspar, the world’s
sixth-biggest coatings maker, to “neutral” from “buy” and
reduced his 2010 and 2011 earnings estimates.
