             Peru signed a free-trade agreement
with a trading bloc comprising Switzerland, Iceland,
Lichtenstein and Norway, said Foreign Trade Minister Martin
Perez.  
 The four European nations, which make up the European Free
Trade Association, signed the accord today in Lima, Perez said.  
 Peru exported almost $4 billion to EFTA countries last
year, led by sales of gold to Switzerland, according to Lima-
based research company Veritrade.  
 The Andean country may increase exports to $33 billion next
year and $40 billion in 2013, the Finance Ministry said May 31.
Commodities account for three-quarters of Peru’s exports.  
 Peru concluded free trade negotiations with the European
Union in May.
