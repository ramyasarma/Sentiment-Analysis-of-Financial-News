             Crude oil will climb to as much as
$90 a barrel by the end of this year and $100 in 2011, T. Boone
Pickens, the billionaire energy hedge-fund manager, said
today.  
 The price of oil will “move up here pretty quick in the
third quarter,” Pickens, chairman of Dallas-based BP Capital
LLC, said today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio.
Pickens said he expects oil prices in the range of $85 to $90 a
barrel by the end of 2010 and $95 to $100 a barrel in 2011.
