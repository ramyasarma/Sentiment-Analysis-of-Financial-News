             Russian stocks declined the most in
almost two weeks after oil retreated from a two-week high,
hurting the outlook for producers in the world’s biggest energy
exporter.  
 Oil companies  OAO Gazprom Neft  and  OAO Lukoil  fell more
than 1.5 percent. The  Micex Index  of 30 stocks retreated 0.7
percent to 1,358.6 at the close in Moscow, its first loss in
four days. The gauge reversed earlier gains of as much as 0.9
percent.  
 U.S. stockpiles of crude oil, gasoline and distillate fuel
increased last week, the American Petroleum Institute said
yesterday. An Energy Department report today may show that
supplies of crude oil slipped 1.5 million barrels last week from
358.2 million, according to the median of responses in a
Bloomberg News survey. Crude declined 0.4 percent to $76.87 at
the close of equities trading in Moscow.
