             Investors last week opened the
fewest accounts to trade Chinese stocks in five months even as
the nation’s equities climbed the most this year.  
 Individual investors created 217,557  accounts , data from
the nation’s clearing house showed today, a 22 percent drop from
the previous week and the lowest for a five-day trading week
since the period ended Feb. 12.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  jumped 3.7 percent last week,
2010’s biggest gain, on speculation the government will wind
back tightening measures that helped make the gauge Asia’s worst
performer this year. The index has slumped 25 percent since
December on concern government efforts to curb inflation and
property speculation will slow growth in the world’s third-
largest economy.  
 “Institutional investors sometimes use account openings as
a contrary indicator,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China
Securities Co. in Shanghai. “When the number drops to a very
low level, that can signal a good bottom-fishing opportunity to
big players.”  
 The Shanghai Composite rose 0.8 percent to 2,469.63 as of
9:46 a.m. local time.  
 China’s national pension fund bought more than 2 billion
yuan ($295 million) of A shares recently, the Securities Times
reported July 7, citing unidentified people familiar with the
situation and without giving a timeframe.
