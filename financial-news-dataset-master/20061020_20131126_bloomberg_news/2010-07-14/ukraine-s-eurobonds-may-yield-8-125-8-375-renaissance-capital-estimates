             Ukraine’s Eurobonds, which the
government is selling to cover this year’s budget deficit, will
probably carry a yield of 8.125 percent to 8.375 percent,
Renaissance Capital said.  
 “The timing of the bond placement is favorable,” the
Moscow-based investment bank said in a report today.  
 Ukraine needs to raise $2 billion in Eurobonds this year to
cover its fiscal shortfall. The government selected JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and VTB Capital to lead the issuance.  
 Deputy Premier  Serhiy Tigipko  said last week the government
was not going to “take money at any cost.” The government,
which started its road show in Munich on July 6, would consider
a yield of 8.5 percent too high, Finance Minister Fedir
Yaroshenko said July 7.
