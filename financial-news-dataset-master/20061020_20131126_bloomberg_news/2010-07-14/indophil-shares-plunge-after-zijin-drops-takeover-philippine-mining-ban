             Indophil Resources NL  fell the most
in more than eight years in Sydney trading after Zijin Mining
Group Co. dropped its A$545 million ($482 million) takeover
offer and a local government mining ban in the Philippines.  
 Indophil shares fell 50 percent to 55 cents at 10:15 a.m.
Sydney time on the Australian stock exchange. That’s the most
since May 6, 2002. They haven’t traded since June 10.  
 Zijin, China’s largest gold producer, canceled its purchase
last month after an outgoing governor approved a ban on open-pit
mining in the Philippine province of South Cotabato, location of
the $5.2 billion Tampakan project. Indophil, which has a one-
third stake in the largest untapped gold and copper deposit in
Southeast Asia, said today it’s in talks with other groups.  
 “Tampakan is a world class mine project - assuming they
have a licence to dig,” said  Ben Potter , market strategist at IG
Markets Ltd. in Melbourne said by phone. “The stock traded
north of A$1 before the Zijin takeover bid, so a more than 50
percent drop is factoring a very bearish scenario.”  
 “Indophil has received strong expressions of interest from
credible and substantial parties comprising Chinese and non-
Chinese groups,” the Melbourne-based company said today in a
statement. The company opened a data room for potential
acquirers, it said.  
 President  Benigno Aquino , who took office this month, a day
after the province banned open-pit mining, has said he will
press for an agreement that will protect the environment while
allowing the project to proceed.  
 “Indophil is very high risk, but President Aquino coming
out to say he’ll try and get some agreement is positive,” IG
Market’s Potter said. “It’s a case of ‘watch this space.”
