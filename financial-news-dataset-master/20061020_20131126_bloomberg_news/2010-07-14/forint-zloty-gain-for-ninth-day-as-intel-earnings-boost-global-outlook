             Hungary’s forint and Poland’s zloty
strengthened for a ninth day against the euro as Intel Corp.’s
sales report boosted confidence that the global economic
recovery is sound.  
 The forint advanced 0.4 percent to 276.97 per euro as of
9:55 a.m. in Budapest, for a gain of 3.4 percent in its longest
series of increases since 2005. The zloty added 0.3 percent to
4.0577 per euro, giving it a 2.7 percent appreciation in its
longest winning streak since April 2008. The two currencies both
lost 6.7 percent versus the euro in the second quarter, which
made them the world’s worst performers.  
 Equities rallied worldwide and the euro gained against the
dollar, heading for a two-month high, after Intel, the world’s
biggest chipmaker, reported record second-quarter sales and
Singapore raised its 2010 growth forecast. This added to
optimism Europe’s debt crisis won’t slow the global recovery, a
day after Greece sold bonds at a rate below what the country
pays for European Union aid.  
 “The forint and zloty are being helped by the firmer
euro,”  Nigel Rendell , senior emerging-market strategist at RBC
Capital Markets in London, wrote in an e-mail. “It seems that
issues relating to the budget and debt problems are, for now,
being put on the back burner, with attention focusing instead on
the extent and duration of the U.S. and global recovery.”  
 The zloty and forint typically outperform the euro when it
rallies against the dollar, Rendell wrote.
