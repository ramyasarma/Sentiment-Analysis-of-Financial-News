             AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. , the
second-largest U.S. movie-theater chain, filed for an initial
stock sale of $450 million to reduce debt.  
 The company, based in Kansas City, Missouri, didn’t
disclose the number of shares to be sold or their proposed price
in a  regulatory filing  today.  
 AMC is raising cash after the purchase in May of closely
held Kerasotes Showplace Theatres LLC of Chicago for $275
million in cash. As of April 1, the company had $2.27 billion in
debt, according to the filing.  
 The company plans to repay all $198.3 million of loans
outstanding under a term loan facility, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, according to the filing. It also intends to retire all
$240.8 million of its 12 percent senior discount notes due 2014.  
 AMC is owned by Marquee Holdings, an investment company
controlled by private-equity investors including JPMorgan
Partners LLC and Apollo Global Management LLC.
