             Australia Ratings Pty Ltd. , a new
credit assessment company, said it won the first license from
the country’s market regulator to provide grades on debt
products sold to individual investors.  
 Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch
Ratings didn’t apply for retail licenses after new rules came
into force on Jan. 1, meaning companies can’t use their ratings
when seeking to market debt to individuals.  
 That “has left a gap in the market which Australia Ratings
seeks to fill,” Managing Director  Chris Dalton  said in an e-
mailed statement. Dalton worked at Standard & Poor’s for 18
years, including eight as head of its Australia and New Zealand
unit, according to the statement.  
 Australia’s government introduced the retail license to
help resolve potential disputes between investors and credit
assessment agencies over the accuracy of the ratings they
assign. S&P said in November it halted plans to get a license
because the disputes resolution process being proposed would
interfere with the global consistency of its ratings and may
force it to disclose confidential information.  
 Moody’s and Fitch add a disclaimer on ratings announcements
saying they are unable to provide advice to retail investors.  
 Australia Ratings, based in Melbourne, also holds a license
to give ratings on products for wholesale investors, according
to its statement.
