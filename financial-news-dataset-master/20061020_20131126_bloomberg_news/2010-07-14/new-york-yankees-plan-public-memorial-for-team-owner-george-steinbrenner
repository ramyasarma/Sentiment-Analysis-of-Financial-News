             George Steinbrenner ’s family will
hold a private funeral service for the New York Yankees owner,
who died yesterday at the age of 80.  
 A public memorial is being planned and details will be
announced next week, the Yankees said in a statement.  
 “We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks for the many
kind words of condolence,” Steinbrenner’s family said in a
statement. “We have been deeply moved by the generous
outpouring of love and affection for George.”  
 The Yankees won seven of their 27 World Series titles
during Steinbrenner’s 37-year tenure as owner. Steinbrenner’s
sons, Hal and Hank, are now running the team, which said
yesterday it will wear uniform patches for the rest of the
season to honor the man who was known as “The Boss.”  
 The Yankees, who have Major League Baseball’s best record
at 56-32, next play in two days with a home game against the
Tampa Bay Rays. The Yankees’ Old-Timers Day celebration is
scheduled for July 17 at Yankee Stadium.  
 Seven members of the Yankees’ 1950 championship team will
be in attendance, including Hall of Famers  Yogi Berra  and  Whitey Ford , while former players such as  Reggie Jackson ,  Rickey Henderson  and  Rich “Goose” Gossage  also will participate.
