             Pakistan reached 114-1 at stumps on
the third day of the first cricket Test and trails Australia by
325 runs.  
 Facing what would be a world-record victory target of 440,
Pakistan lost one wicket in the final session at Lord’s in
London when  Imran Farhat  was dismissed for 24. Salman Butt is on
58 and Azhar Ali has 28.  
 Australia totaled 334 runs in its second innings. Resuming
today on 100-4, it lost nightwatchman  Mitchell Johnson , bowled
by  Umar Gul  for 30.  
 Simon Katich , who made 80 in the first innings, was out for
83 and  Marcus North  made 20. Steve Smith (12) and Tim Paine (47)
followed, with Doug Bollinger the last man out on 21. No. 10
batsman Ben Hilfenhaus got an unbeaten 56 in 84 balls. Gul ended
on 4-61.  
 Pakistan had crumbled to 148 all out in its first innings
yesterday, Shane Watson taking 5-40. Australia was all out for
253 in its first innings.  
 It’s the first neutral Test at the “home of cricket”
since 1912 and is being held there because of security concerns
over staging matches in Pakistan. The two-match series counts as
a home event for Pakistan.
