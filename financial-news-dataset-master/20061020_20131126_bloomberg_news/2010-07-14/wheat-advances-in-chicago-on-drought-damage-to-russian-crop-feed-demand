             Wheat futures rose in Chicago,
erasing earlier declines, on prospects for reduced production in
Russia and more demand for the grain to feed livestock.  
 Russia’s wheat crop harvested from next month may be 51
million metric tons, down from 61.7 million tons last year,
because of drought, Rabobank analyst  Luke Chandler  said. Hot,
dry weather will persist in parts of Russia through July 17,
according to the Federal Hydrometeorological Service.  
 “The news continues to look poor in terms of what yields
might be,” Chandler said by phone from London today. “If
you’ve got a lot less wheat supplies in Russia and Europe then
places like Egypt, North Africa will have to turn to the U.S. as
supplier and the U.S. is the one part of the world where it’s
looking like they have continued high stockpiles.”  
 Wheat for delivery in September rose 0.5 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $5.4975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at
1:31 p.m. London time. Prices had dropped as much as 0.7
percent.  
 November futures for milling wheat, used to make bread,
climbed 1.9 percent to 164.75 euros ($209) a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe in Paris.  
 Higher corn prices are supporting wheat as ranchers and
farmers may turn to wheat for livestock feed because it’s lagged
behind gains in corn prices, Chandler said. Corn jumped 8.3
percent in the second quarter, more than twice the advance in
wheat prices.  
 “We’ve seen a shift in corn, and that underpins wheat’s
value,” Chandler said.  
 Corn for December delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $3.8875 a
bushel and soybeans for November delivery increased 0.5 percent
to $9.5925 a bushel.
