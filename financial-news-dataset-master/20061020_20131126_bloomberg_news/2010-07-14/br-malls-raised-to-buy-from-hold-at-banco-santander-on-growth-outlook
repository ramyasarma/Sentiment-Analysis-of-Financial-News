             BR Malls Participacoes SA was raised
to “buy” from “hold” by Banco Santander SA analysts led by
Flavio Queiroz, who cited the company’s “strong” growth
prospects, its “robust track record” in turning around
acquired units and the growth in rental prices.  
 The shares may rise to 32.50 reais next year, compared with
this year’s forecast of 28 reais, the analysts said.
