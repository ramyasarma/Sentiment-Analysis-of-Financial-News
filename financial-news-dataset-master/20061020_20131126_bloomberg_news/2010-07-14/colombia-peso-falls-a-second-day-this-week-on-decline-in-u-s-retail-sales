             Colombia’s borrowing costs declined
to the lowest level this year at a government debt auction after
economists lowered inflation forecasts and as speculation
mounted that the country’s credit rating will be raised to
investment grade.  
 The yield on Colombia’s securities due July 2024 fell to
7.84 percent from 8.19 percent at the last auction on June 23,
the Finance Ministry said in a statement. The yield on the
fixed-rate bonds, known as TES, that are due June 2016 fell to
7.13 percent from 7.64 percent at the previous auction.  
 “People are pretty bullish on Colombia and that’s
reflected in appetite both for external and local debt,” said
 Francisco Chaves , a fixed-income strategist at Bogota-based
brokerage Corredores Asociados SA. “Inflation is controlled and
the improved view for investment grade is pushing gains in
TES.”  
 The decline in yields in today’s TES auction comes even
after the government said July 2 it would sell an additional 2
trillion pesos ($1.07 billion) of local debt to replace revenue
from the scrapped sale of power company Isagen SA.  
 Economists lowered their expectations for year-end
inflation to 3.06 percent in a central bank survey this month,
compared to 3.11 percent in the June survey. The central bank
targets inflation of 2 percent to 4 percent this year.  
 Credit Rating  
 Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, which rates Colombia
BB+, or one level below investment grade, on July 7 raised its
outlook on the country’s credit rating to positive from stable.
The move follows comments from  Alessandra Alecci , an analyst
with Moody’s Investors Service, who said in a June 30 interview
that the agency is “optimistic” on Colombia and that there is
“potential” for the nation to move toward investment grade.  
 Moody’s rates Colombia’s foreign debt Ba1, or one level
below investment grade with a stable outlook. Colombia is rated
BB+ by Fitch Ratings.  
 Speculation an upgrade would lure more foreign investors to
the country’s financial assets has helped push yields on
Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020 to a four-
year low.  
 The yield fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
to 7.54 percent at 3:04 p.m. New York time, according to
Colombia’s stock exchange. That’s the lowest level on a closing
basis since March 29, 2006. The bond’s price rose 0.433 centavo
to 123.739 centavos per peso.  
 Colombia’s peso erased an earlier decline, gaining 0.1
percent to 1,871.65 per U.S. dollar, from 1,872.65 yesterday.
The peso has jumped 9.2 percent this year, the best performance
among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Demand for the fixed-rate securities due 2016 and 2024
auctioned today equaled 1.2 trillion pesos, more than twice the
450 billion pesos offered.
