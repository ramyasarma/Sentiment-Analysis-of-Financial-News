             Zijin Mining Group Co.  is unlikely
to restart copper production for at least six months at its
Zijinshan mine after a leak of waste water polluted a local
river, the South China Morning Post reported, citing company
secretary Zheng Yuqiang.  
 It would better if more time were taken to fix any problem
areas before production resumed, the newspaper cited Zheng as
saying.
