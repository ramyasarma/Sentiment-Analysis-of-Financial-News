             A divergence in gold options is
signaling the metal’s rally may pause as Europe’s sovereign-debt
concerns ease, said William O’Neill, a partner at Logic
Advisors.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY shows open interest in options that
allow the holder to buy gold at $2,000 an ounce by December 2011
has surged 11-fold since May 11 on the Comex. At the same time,
open interest to buy at $1,500 by the end of the year has
slumped 33 percent, signaling that traders are “less
optimistic” on short-term prospects for bullion, O’Neill said.  
 “People are starting to think we’ll see some financial
stability in the next few quarters that will probably cause a
bullish pause for gold,” O’Neill said yesterday in a telephone
interview from Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. “Down the road,
there are still uncertainties and the threat of inflation that
will keep prices supported.”  
 On the Comex in New York, gold futures have surged 32
percent in the past 12 months, reaching a record $1,266.50 on
June 21. Yesterday, the price climbed 1.2 percent to $1,213.50.  
 The December 2011 $2,000 call contract is the most widely
held option, followed by the December 2010 $1,500 call.  
 “The short-term indicators look a little shaky,” O’Neill
said. “People should take profit for now while maintaining a
longer-term bullish view.”
