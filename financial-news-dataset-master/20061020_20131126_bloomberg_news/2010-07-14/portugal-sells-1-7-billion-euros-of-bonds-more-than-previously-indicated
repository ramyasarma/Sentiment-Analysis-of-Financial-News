             Portugal sold 1.68 billion euros
($2.1 billion) of bonds due in 2012 and 2019, a higher total
amount than indicated by the country’s debt agency before
today’s auction.  
 The securities due June 2012 were issued at an average
yield of 3.159 percent, the country’s debt management agency
said. That compares with an average yield of 1.715 percent at a
previous auction of the same-maturity debt on April 14. The
auction attracted bids for 2.3 times the amount offered,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.5 in April.  
 The bonds due June 2019 were issued at an average yield of
5.304 percent. That compares with an average yield of 4.129
percent at a previous auction of the same-maturity debt on July
28, 2009. Today’s auction attracted bids for 1.5 times the
amount offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.6. in
the July 2009 sale.  
 The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, on July 8 said the
total indicative amount for both bonds in today’s auction would
range between 1 billion euros and 1.5 billion euros.
