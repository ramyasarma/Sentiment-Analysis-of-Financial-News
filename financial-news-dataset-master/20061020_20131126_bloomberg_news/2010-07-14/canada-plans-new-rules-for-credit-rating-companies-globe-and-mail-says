             Canadian provinces’ securities
regulators will announce new measures July 16 to strengthen
accountability of credit-rating companies, the Globe and Mail
reported.  
 The new rules would give the regulators authority to the
demand changes to the way the rating companies such as Moody’s
Investors Service Inc. and DBRS Ltd. operate, the newspaper said
today, citing unidentified people.  
 The agencies would have to sign a code of conduct to deal
with issues such as conflict of interest, the Globe said.
