 Terrorist bomb attacks in Uganda
this week are unlikely to slow economic growth, central bank
Deputy Governor Louis Kasekende said in an interview in Kenya’s
capital, Nairobi.  
 “This shouldn’t have a major impact on the economy,”
Kasekende said today. “We are monitoring and will use our forex
store if need be to intervene. But right now, we don’t see the
need.”  
 The country currently has foreign currency reserves of
about $2.6 billion, he said.
