             Seven-time Tour de France champion
 Lance Armstrong  said he’ll cooperate with a “credible and
fair” investigation following doping allegations made by former
teammate  Floyd Landis .  
 Landis sent e-mails to cycling officials in April and May
alleging wrongdoing by Armstrong and other members of a team
that was sponsored by the United States Postal Service. Federal
authorities have issued subpoenas against witnesses, the New
York Times reported today.  
 “As long as we have a legitimate and credible and fair
investigation I will be happy to cooperate but I’m not going to
participate in any kind of witch-hunt,” Armstrong told
reporters at the Tour de France today. The comments were
confirmed in an e-mail from Armstrong’s spokesman Mark Higgins.  
 Armstrong denied that he was a shareholder of Tailwind
Sports, which owned the team that was sponsored by the U.S.
Postal Service.  
 “I never had any dealing, any dealings with the Postal
Services,” Armstrong said.  
 Armstrong, who hasn’t failed a drugs test and repeatedly
denied doping, is riding his last Tour de France with a team
sponsored by RadioShack Corp. Landis, stripped of his 2006 Tour
win for doping, detailed what he said was the subterfuge in e-
mails in May that accused Armstrong of transfusing blood in 2003
and 2004. Armstrong rejected the claims.  
 Armstrong is in 31st place after 10 stages of the race and
ended the first Alps portion with his bid for an eighth and
final victory in tatters.  
 Crashed Out  
 The Texan crashed just before the first of two climbs on
July 11th and struggled to recover. He finished the eighth
stage, to Morzine-Avoriaz, 11 minutes, 45 seconds behind winner
 Andy Schleck  of Luxembourg.  
 “The Tour’s finished for me,” Armstrong said afterward.
“But I can stay in the race, try and win stages, help the
team.”  
 The 38-year-old Armstrong, who came out of retirement to
place third at last year’s race, said in June this will be his
final time riding the Tour de France. The American said that,
for the remainder of the race, which ends July 25 in Paris,
he’ll try and “appreciate the fact that I’m not coming back.”
