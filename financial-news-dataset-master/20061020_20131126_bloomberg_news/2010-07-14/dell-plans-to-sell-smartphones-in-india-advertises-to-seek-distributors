             Dell Inc. , the third-biggest
personal-computer maker, will sell its smartphones in India to
enter the world’s second-largest wireless market.  
 The company, based in Round Rock, Texas, which already
sells computers to home users and businesses in the world’s
second-most populous country, placed an advertisement in local
newspapers today, saying it is making “a move into mobile
phones” and sought distributors with “retail reach.”  
 “India is one of the key markets for Dell and as we work
on the plans to bring smartphones to this market, we continue to
explore various go-to-market options,” Mahesh Bhalla, a general
manager who oversees the local unit’s consumer division, said in
an e-mailed response to a query about the company’s plans.  
 Dell, which follows  Apple Inc.  and  Research  in Motion Ltd.
to India, is seeking to tap a market where users are expected to
exceed 771 million by 2013, according to researcher Gartner Inc.
India had about 618 million mobile-phone accounts as of end-May,
according to the nation’s  telecom regulator , second only to
China’s market in size.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Michael Dell  led his namesake
company into the smartphone market in 2009 and set up a new
communications group in December, headed by former Motorola Inc.
phone chief  Ron Garriques , to develop phones and other mobile
gadgets.
