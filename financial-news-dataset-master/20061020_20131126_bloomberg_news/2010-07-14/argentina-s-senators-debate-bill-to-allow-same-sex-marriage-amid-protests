             Argentina’s Senate will discuss
today a government-supported bill to allow same-sex marriage, a
proposal that raised complaints by the Roman Catholic Church.  
 Miguel Pichetto , head of the ruling coalition bloc, told
reporters that he’s confident a majority of lawmakers will vote
for the bill. He said the measure was similar to laws in
European countries including Spain and Belgium.  
 Thousands of people marched in Buenos Aires streets
yesterday at rallies in favor and against same-sex marriage.
Argentine Cardinal  Jorge Bergoglio  said July 8 that the proposal
isn’t “a political fight but an intention to destroy God’s
plan,” according to newspaper InfoBae.com.  
 “The bill doesn’t force people to get married with people
of the same sex, it simply takes account of a pre-existing
reality,” President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said in a
July 12 news conference in China. “It’s very worrisome to
listen to expressions like ‘war of God’ or ‘projects of the
devil’ and things that recall the times of the Inquisition.”  
 The bill was approved in May by the lower house of
Congress.
