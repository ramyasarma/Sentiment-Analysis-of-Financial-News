             Mitsui & Co., Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. may decide by
November whether to make a joint bid for a high-speed railway
project in Brazil, Nikkei English News said, without citing
anyone.   
 The winning bidder will build and operate the railway to
connect Rio de Janeiro and Campinas via Sao Paulo, the report
said.    
 Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. decided last year not to bid
as a main contractor after determining that demand for the
service would be insufficient, the report said.
