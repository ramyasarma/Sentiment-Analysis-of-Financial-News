             Exports of Angolan crude oil from
the Girassol field operated by Total SA may be canceled or
delayed because of production difficulties, according to a
trader with knowledge of the matter.  
 The Paris-based company declared force majeure, meaning
scheduled deliveries may not be made because of circumstances
beyond the seller’s control, according to the trader. Total
officials in Paris didn’t immediately return calls seeking
comment today, which is a public holiday in France.  
 Exports from the Girassol field were originally planned to
average 193,548 barrels a day in August, according to loading
schedules. The trader declined to be identified because the
information isn’t public.
