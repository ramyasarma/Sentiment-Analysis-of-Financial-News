             Pakistan’s trade deficit narrowed by
22.7 percent in June as exports climbed and imports fell.  
 The trade gap narrowed to $1.41 billion in the last month
of the fiscal year, from $1.82 billion a year ago, according to
a faxed statement from the Commerce Ministry in Islamabad.  
 “The decline in oil prices from last year was one of the
main factors in narrowing the trade gap,” said  Muhammed Imran ,
head of research at Arif Habib Securities Ltd., in Karachi.
“The revival of demand for Pakistani textile from overseas
helped.”  
 Overseas sales rose 19.5 percent to $1.82 billion, while
imports fell 3.45 percent to $3.22 billion, the data show.  
 Pakistan is seeking to boost exports to sustain growth in a
country where the World Bank estimates a quarter of the
population lives on less than a dollar a day.  
 Pakistan’s trade deficit narrowed 10.5 percent to $15.3
billion in the 12 months ended June 30, from $17.1 billion a
year earlier. Exports rose 9.6 percent to $19.4 billion and
imports dropped 0.3 percent to $34.7 billion in the 12 month
period.
