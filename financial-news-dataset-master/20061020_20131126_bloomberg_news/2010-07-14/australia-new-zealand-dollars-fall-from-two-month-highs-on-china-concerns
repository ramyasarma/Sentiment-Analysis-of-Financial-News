             The Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell on speculation ebbing growth in China will lead to
diminished demand for exports from the South Pacific nations.  
 The currencies followed declines in stocks after government
data showed China’s  gross domestic product  growth eased to 10.3
percent in the second quarter and industrial production cooled
more than forecast in June. The Aussie and the kiwi, as the
currencies are known, extended losses as reports showed
manufacturing in the New York and Philadelphia regions expanded
at the slowest pace this  year.  
 The Chinese data “effectively put a lid on the rally and
Aussie has drifted back down as dollar-yen comes under
pressure,” said  Sue Trinh , a senior currency strategist in Hong
Kong at Royal Bank of Canada. “The market is rather jittery.”  
 Australia’s dollar fell 0.9 percent to 87.72 U.S. cents at
12:26 p.m. in New York from 88.51 cents yesterday when it
reached to 88.71 cents, the highest level since May 14. The
currency declined 2 percent to 76.66 yen.  
 New Zealand’s dollar weakened to 72.22 U.S. cents after
rising yesterday to 72.55 cents, the strongest since May 10. The
currency slid 1.4 percent 63.100 yen.  
 China’s second-quarter gain in GDP was less than an 11.9
percent increase in January-March from a year earlier. Inflation
cooled to 2.9 percent in June, the statistics bureau also
reported in Beijing today. Industrial output rose 13.7 percent,
less than all but one of 27 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index and the Philadelphia Fed’s gauge fell in July, reflecting
the slowest pace of manufacturing expansion this year.  
 The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index slid 0.8 percent and the
Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.9 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  dropped 1 percent, halting a seven-day rally.  
 A New Zealand manufacturing  index  rose to 56.2 from a
revised 54.4 in May, Bank of New Zealand Ltd. and Business New
Zealand, a Wellington-based employer group, said on the group’s
website. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion.
