             New Zealand’s energy industry cut
emissions of greenhouse gases by 7 percent last year, the
Ministry of Economic Development said in a statement today.  
 Emissions from electricity generation fell 24 percent,
driven by relatively higher lake levels that cut reliance on
more emissions-intensive thermal power output, the ministry
said.
