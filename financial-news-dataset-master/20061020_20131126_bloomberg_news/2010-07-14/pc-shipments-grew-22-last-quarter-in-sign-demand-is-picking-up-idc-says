             Global personal-computer shipments
rose 22 percent in the second quarter, a sign consumer demand is
picking up even amid lingering concerns about the pace of
economic recovery, according to research firm IDC.  
 Hewlett-Packard Co.  remained the market leader, though its
share fell to 18.1 percent from 19.7 percent a year earlier,
Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC said in a statement today.
 Dell Inc.  recaptured the No. 2 spot, pushing Acer Inc. to third.  
 The replacement of aging systems, the introduction of
lower-cost machines and the fact that much of the world doesn’t
own a computer are all driving growth, said Jay Chou, an
analyst at IDC. The results allayed concerns that a rebound in
technology spending might slow, partly because of the European
debt crisis. The increase was in line with IDC’s projection of
23 percent.  
 “The PC vendors can pat themselves on the back a little
bit,” Chou said in an interview. “Given the uncertainty in
Europe and fears of slowdown in places like China, we still did
pretty well.”  
 Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, had 13 percent of the
market, while Taiwan’s Acer had 12.6 percent. Both companies
lost market share from a year earlier.  Dell  benefited from
improving business demand and strong growth in the Asia-Pacific
region and Latin America, IDC said.  
 Beijing-based  Lenovo Group Ltd. , in fourth place, posted 47
percent growth to give it 10.2 percent of the market, according
to IDC.
