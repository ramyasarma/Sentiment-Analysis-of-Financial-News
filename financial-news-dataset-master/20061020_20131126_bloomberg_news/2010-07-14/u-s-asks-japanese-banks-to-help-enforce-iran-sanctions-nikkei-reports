             Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc. were asked directly by the U.S. to help enforce
toughened sanctions against Iran, Assistant Secretary of
Treasury David Cohen told Nikkei English News.  
 Cohen visited the banks yesterday and briefed officers
there on the U.S.’s newest unilateral sanctions, Nikkei said.
Cohen said in an interview that the three banks “are major
international financial institutions” with operations around
the globe, including Iran.
