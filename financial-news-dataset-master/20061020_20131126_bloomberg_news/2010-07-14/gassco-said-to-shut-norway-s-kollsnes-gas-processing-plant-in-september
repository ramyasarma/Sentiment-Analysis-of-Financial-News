             Gassco AS, Norway’s  natural-gas
pipeline  operator, will suspend exports from its Kollsnes gas-
processing plant in September as it closes for maintenance,
according to six people with knowledge of the work schedule.  
 Kollsnes is scheduled to shut for two weeks from Sept. 12,
two of the people said, declining to be identified because the
information hasn’t been publicly released. The other four didn’t
give specific dates. Bygnes-based Gassco spokeswoman  Lisbet Kallevik  declined to comment when reached by phone today.  
 Norway, the world’s second-biggest gas exporter after
Russia, is the U.K.’s largest foreign supplier of the fuel.
Kollsnes receives gas from offshore fields including  Statoil
ASA -operated Troll, Kvitebjoern and Visund, and sends it via
pipelines under the North Sea to Britain and mainland Europe.
Gassco has said it will shut its other processing plant for
almost three weeks next month.  
 Kollsnes can process as much as 143 million cubic meters (5
billion cubic feet) of gas and 69,000 barrels of natural-gas
liquids a day, according to Gassco’s  website . It often handles
less in summer, when demand for heating fuels is lower.  
 Gassco said in March it plans to shut the Kaarstoe gas-
processing facility on Norway’s west coast, capable of handling
88 million cubic meters a day, from Aug. 18 through Sept. 7.  
 Troll produced 2.4 billion cubic meters of gas in May,
Kvitebjoern pumped 520 million cubic meters and Visund 102
million cubic meters, according to the  Norwegian Petroleum
Directorate .
