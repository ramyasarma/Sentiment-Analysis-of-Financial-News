             Crude oil was little changed,
retreating from a two-week high with U.S. equities after minutes
from the Federal Reserve showed policy makers saying the
economic outlook has “softened somewhat.”  
 Oil declined as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped for
the first time in seven sessions. Prices rose earlier after an
Energy Department report showed that inventories of crude oil
declined more than expected, refineries bolstered operating
rates and fuel stockpiles increased.  
 “Oil is coming back down along with the S&P 500, which
continues to a major guide for the market,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “We’ve
also got a tug of war between the crude and fuel inventories in
today’s report.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery slipped 11 cents to settle at
$77.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures
reached $78.15 today, the highest intraday price since June 29.  
 Oil on the Nymex for August delivery is 41 cents a barrel
lower than for September, the smallest divergence between front-
month contracts since April 20.  
 Brent crude for August settlement increased 12 cents to end
the session at $76.77 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. August Brent futures expire tomorrow. The more-
active September contract slipped 7 cents to $76.66 a barrel.  
 The S&P 500 declined 0.4 percent to 1,090.72 at 3:12 p.m.
and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 36.53 points, or 0.4
percent, to 10,326.50. The indexes gained after the oil market
settled, closing little changed.  
 ‘Softening’ Outlook  
 “The economic outlook had softened somewhat and a number of
members saw the risks to the outlook as having shifted to the
downside,” minutes released today in Washington said. “The
changes to the outlook were viewed as relatively modest and as
not warranting policy accommodation beyond that already in
place.”  
 Crude-oil  supplies  fell 5.06 million barrels, or 1.4
percent, to 353.1 million, the most since September, according
to the Energy Department. Stockpiles were forecast to slip 1.5
million barrels, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Refineries
operated at 90.5 percent of capacity, the highest level since
January 2008.  
 Inventories have dropped 12 million barrels in three weeks
to the lowest level since March 19. It’s the longest string of
declines since December. Supplies are 7 percent above the five-
year average for the period, the department said.  
 “On the face of it, the crude oil number looks very
bullish, but on second look it’s not so worrisome,” said  Rick Mueller , director of oil markets at Energy Security Analysis
Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts. “We still have more than 350
million barrels of oil, so stocks are by no means tight.”  
 Fuel Stockpiles  
 Gasoline supplies climbed 1.6 million barrels to 221
million in the week ended July 9, the report showed. The 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News were split over whether
inventories would rise or fall.  
 Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, increased 2.94 million barrels to 162.6
million, almost three times the size of the gain forecast.  
 Gasoline for August delivery slipped 1.56 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.0665 a gallon in New York. Heating oil
for August delivery declined 1.13 cents, or 0.6 percent, to end
the session at $2.0361 a gallon.  
 Fuel demand tumbled 4 percent to 18.8 million barrels a
day, the lowest level since April 23. It was the biggest one-
week decline since March.  
 “The demand numbers don’t look good,” said  Michael Lynch ,
president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
Massachusetts. “They show that consumers are holding back
because of uncertainty about the economy.”  
 Technical Resistance  
 Crude oil in New York must challenge resistance near $80 or
test support at $72.50 to break out of its range, according to
 Veronique Lashinski , a senior research analyst for Newedge USA
LLC in Chicago.  
 New York oil for September delivery, which will become the
front-month contract on July 21, touched $80.82 a barrel on
June 21 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest price
since May 14.  
 Crude oil will climb to as much as $90 a barrel by the end
of this year and $100 in 2011,  T. Boone Pickens , the billionaire
energy hedge-fund manager, said today.  
 Prices will “move up here pretty quick in the third
quarter,” Pickens, chairman of Dallas-based BP Capital LLC,
said today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio with  Tom Keene .
Pickens said he expects oil in the range of $85 to $90 a barrel
by the end of 2010 and $95 to $100 a barrel in 2011.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 591,708
contracts as of 5:03 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 683,536
contracts yesterday, 9.6 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.28 million contracts.
