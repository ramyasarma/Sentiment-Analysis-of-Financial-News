             The Green Bay Packers’ net income
rose by about 30 percent to $5.2 million in the fiscal year
ending March 31, team officials said.  
 Mark Murphy , chief executive of the National Football
League’s only publicly traded franchise, said that despite a
record $258 million in revenue, operating profit declined by
more than half, to $9.8 million from $20.1 million. That’s
driven by the player costs that have prompted owners in the
U.S.’s most-watched television sport to seek a new labor
contract.  
 “It really highlights the concerns we’ve had,” Murphy
said in a conference call with reporters. “It’s obviously not a
good situation when you’ve got player costs growing at a rate
twice that of your revenue.”  
 NFL owners voted unanimously in May 2008 to end the
league’s labor agreement with players two years early, clearing
the way for a work stoppage after the 2010 season.  
 Kevin Mawae , president of the  NFL Players Association , said
in a statement that the Packers’ figures represented “1/32nd of
the financial information we’ve requested in response to their
demand that we give back $1 billion and increase our risk of
injury by playing two additional games.”  
 Murphy said that since the previous agreement was signed in
2006, player costs have risen about 11 percent, or about twice
as much as revenue. Incremental revenue increased $132 million
since 2006, with $123 million going to players.  
 Expenses Up  
 The Packers’ operating expenses rose to about $248 million
from $228 million, including a $22 million increase in player
costs to about $161 million from $139 million, he said.  
 Revenue grew about $10 million, to $258 million, Murphy
said, primarily because money shared among the league’s 32 teams
increased to $157 million from $147 million. Local revenue has
remained flat at around $100 million for three years after a
peak in 2007, he said.  
 “The only growth we’ve seen in revenue in recent years has
been on the national side,” Murphy said.  
 The increase in the Packers’ net profit was driven by
declining investment losses, according to  Larry Weyers , the
team’s treasurer.  
 Green Bay Packers, Inc. has been a publicly owned non-
profit corporation since August 1923,  according to  the team’s
website. More than 110,000 people own about 4.8 million shares,
without receiving a dividend. Shares cannot be resold, except
back to the team for a fraction of the original price.
