             South African bonds snapped a six-
day rally after a report showed retail sales jumped more than
analysts estimated, damping bets the central bank will lower its
benchmark interest rate next week.  
 The 13.5 percent security due September 2015 declined 25
cents to 124.15 rand by 4:19 p.m. in Johannesburg, sending the
yield by 4 basis points higher to 7.72 percent.  
 Retail sales  advanced an annual 4.6 percent in May after
gaining a revised 2.9 percent in April, Pretoria-based
 Statistics South Africa  said on its website today. The  median
estimate  of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for an
increase of 3.7 percent.  
 “The stronger-than-expected number confirms in our minds
that rates will be unchanged next week, given that overall there
has likely not been a sufficient surprise to the South African
Reserve Bank’s outlook since the last meeting on recent data,”
said  Peter Attard Montalto , an emerging-markets analyst at
Nomura International Plc in London.  
 Bond yields have dropped 38 basis points since the end of
last month as investors increased bets that South Africa’s
central bank will cut its 6.5 percent  benchmark rate  when it
meets on July 22 to boost the economy. Consumer spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of the economy, has been slow to rebound
from last year’s recession, even after the central bank lowered
its key rate by 5.5 percentage points since the end of 2008.  
 “The repo will be kept flat at next week’s monetary policy
committee meeting,”  Michael Keenan , a currency strategist at
 Standard Bank Group Ltd.  in Johannesburg, wrote in a client note
today.  
 Money-market investors reduced bets of a rate cut, forward-
rate agreements showed. The cost of  three-month contracts  for
cash due in one month increased 3 basis points to 6.43 percent.  
 The rand traded 0.4 percent weaker at 7.5683 per dollar,
from a previous close of 7.5355. Earlier, the rand appreciated
as much as 0.4 percent to 7.5086, the strongest since June 24.
