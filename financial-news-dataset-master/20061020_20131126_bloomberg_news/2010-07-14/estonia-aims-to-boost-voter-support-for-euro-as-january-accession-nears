             Estonia’s government wants to boost
public support for the euro, which remains below 50 percent, as
the Baltic nation prepares to adopt Europe’s single currency in
less than six months.  
 The government wants voter support for the currency switch
to rise to 65 percent, compared with 45 percent today, said Tea
Varrak, the chancellor of the Finance Ministry, at a press
conference in the capital Tallinn today.  
 The program will target the former Soviet republic’s
Russian speakers and senior citizens, where opposition to the
currency switch is most pronounced, Varrak said.  
 The Russian-speaking minority, mainly living in the north
east of the country, makes up about 30 percent of Estonia’s 1.3
million inhabitants. Estonia won European Commission backing on
May 12 to become the euro area’s 17th member.  
 Varrak said a commission report, which has yet to be
published, on Estonia’s preparedness for euro adoption will
mainly focus on “speeding up and intensifying” efforts to
prevent businesses from rounding prices up as they convert to
euros. Most of the recommendations from the mission, which
visited Estonia in May, have already been implemented, she said.
