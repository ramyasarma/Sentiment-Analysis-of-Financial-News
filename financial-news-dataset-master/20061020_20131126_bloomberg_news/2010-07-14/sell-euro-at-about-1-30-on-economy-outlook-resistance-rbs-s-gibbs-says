             Investors should sell the euro
should it strengthen to about $1.30, anticipating so-called
technical resistance and a worsening European economy, according
to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 “Significant” resistance levels are around $1.3275, which
was a “staging point in March and April this year before the
deeper falls,”  Greg Gibbs , a foreign-exchange strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Sydney, wrote in a note to
investors today. “The rally in the euro and, recently,
stability in European debt markets still must be viewed in the
context of rapid and dramatic deterioration over the preceding
six months.”  
 The euro was little changed against the dollar at $1.2726
as of 8:37 a.m. in London, down from the two-month high of
$1.2739 reached yesterday.  
 “The European economy will start to show the strain of
tighter conditions in its financial system from six months
earlier,” Gibbs wrote.  
 Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, currency or index.
Support is where buy orders may be grouped, and resistance is a
level where sell orders may be clustered.
