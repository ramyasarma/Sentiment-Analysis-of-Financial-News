             State-controlled  Grupa Lotos SA ,
Poland’s second-largest oil refiner, rose the most in almost two
months after the government decided to seek a buyer for its
entire stake in the company.  
 Lotos  jumped  as much as 3.9 percent to 30.8 zloty in Warsaw
trading today, rising the most since May 26. It traded at 30.6
zloty at 11:00 a.m., which valued the government’s 53 percent
stake at 2.11 billion zloty ($660 million). The benchmark WIG20
Index rose 0.6 percent.  
 The Treasury and Economy ministries agreed yesterday to put
the government’s shares in Gdansk-based Lotos up for sale,
Treasury Minister  Aleksander Grad  said in an interview with Tok
FM radio today.  
 Completing the sale of the entire holding will require a
separate decision from the cabinet, which will review offers
from potential bidders, Grad said.  
 Poland, which earlier this year sold 11 percent of Lotos on
the stock exchange, raising 406 million zloty, is seeking an
industry investor that could provide access to oil fields,
Deputy Treasury Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski has said.  
 The Treasury Ministry, the formal owner of the stake, needs
approval from the Economy Ministry, which is responsible for
oil-sector policy, to change current rules that require the
government to own more than 50 percent.  
 Grad, a member of parliament representing the senior
coalition party Citizens Platform, planned to get consent for
the sale in May from Economy Minister  Waldemar Pawlak , who heads
the junior coalition Peasants Party.
