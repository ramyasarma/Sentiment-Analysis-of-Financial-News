             Canada’s main stock index declined
after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting
said that the economic outlook has “softened somewhat.”  
 The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 49.44
points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,623.40 at 2:24 p.m. in Toronto.
The decline in Canada was led by Suncor Energy Inc., which
dropped 1.2 percent to C$32.78, and Manulife Financial Corp.,
which slid 1.6 percent to C$15.46.
