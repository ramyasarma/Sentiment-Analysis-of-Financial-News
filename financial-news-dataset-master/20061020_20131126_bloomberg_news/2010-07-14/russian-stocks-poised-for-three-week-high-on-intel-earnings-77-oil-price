             Russian stocks headed for their
highest level in three weeks after Intel Corp. reported record
second-quarter sales and oil, the country’s chief export, traded
at $77.  
 OAO GMKN Norilsk Nickel , Russia’s largest miner, increased
1.9 percent. Oil producer  OAO Rosneft  advanced 1 percent,
helping to push the  Micex Index  of 30 companies higher by 0.4
percent to 1,373.86 as of 11:38 a.m. in Moscow.  
 Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, beat sales estimates
in the quarter, renewing optimism about technology spending. The
Santa Clara, California-based company said corporate spending is
strengthening, signaling the economy isn’t sliding back into a
recession, and forecast third-quarter sales at $11.6 billion,
exceeding analyst estimates of $10.9 billion in a Bloomberg
survey. Oil neared a two-week high and last traded at $77.18 a
barrel in electronic trading in New York.  
 “The combination of Intel’s better-than-expected second-
quarter results and stronger crude will be favorable both for
the equity market and the ruble,”  Chris Weafer , chief
strategist at UralSib Financial Corp., said in an e-mailed
report today.  
 The Micex has rallied 3.9 percent in the last four days,
helping to pare a 10 percent loss since its April 15 peak.
