             Altos Hornos de Mexico SA said it is
resuming normal levels of coal production today in Mexico’s
northern state of Coahuila after railroads repairs were
completed following disruptions from Hurricane Alex.  
 The Coahuila-based steelmaker known as Ahmsa had been using
some coal reserves to offset a drop in output after Hurricane
Alex caused flooding at mines and impeded transportation on some
roads, said company spokesman  Francisco Orduna .  
 Production “has normalized,” he said, today in a
telephone interview from Monclova, Coahuila. Ahmsa reduced
output by 25,000 metric tons last week, he said.  
 Ahmsa, Mexico’s largest steelmaker, said July 12 it was
evaluating the effects of the storm on short- and medium-term
earnings after some facilities were “severely affected.”  
 Rain from Hurricane Alex on July 1 and July 2 washed out
roads and bridges in the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and
Tamaulipas. Hurricane Alex swept through the region in late
June. It peaked as a Category 2 hurricane, reaching 100 miles
per hour, on June 30.  
 The steelmaker produces about 3 million tons of liquid
steel a year, according to the company’s website.
