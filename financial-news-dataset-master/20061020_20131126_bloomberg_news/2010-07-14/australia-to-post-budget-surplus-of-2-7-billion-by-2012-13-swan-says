             Australian Treasurer  Wayne Swan 
projected a higher-than-expected A$3.1 billion ($2.7 billion)
surplus in three years on surging tax revenue from mining
companies as the government prepares to call an election.  
 The economy will expand 3 percent in 2010-11, less than the
3.25 percent forecast in May, Swan said in Canberra today. The
government will raise an additional A$6 billion in resource
company tax because of higher commodity prices, he said.  
 Swan released the first update to the nation’s outlook
since  Julia Gillard  ousted  Kevin Rudd  as prime minister on June
24. The leadership change was followed by the biggest jump in
consumer confidence in 13 months, a report today showed.  
 “Australia’s economy continues to lead the developed world,
with a strong employment outlook and the budget back on track to
return to surplus in three years,” Swan said in a statement
released in Canberra.  
 Swan boosted the forecast 2012-13 surplus to A$3.1 billion
from the A$1 billion predicted in May. He also narrowed the
2010-11 deficit projection to A$40.4 billion from A$40.8 billion
and the 2011-12 gap to A$10 billion from A$13 billion.  
 The figures will have little bearing on the outlook for the
supply of government bonds, said  Joshua Williamson , an economist
at Citigroup Inc. in Sydney. Australia needs between A$50
billion and A$60 billion of ongoing supply to function, he said.  
 ‘Strong Demand’  
 “There’s very strong demand” for Australia’s AAA-rated
debt, Williamson said by telephone. “There will continue to be
pressure for the government to continue issuing bonds, certainly
above that amount, even when we’ve gone back to surplus.”  
 The unemployment rate will drop to 4.75 percent in 2011-12,
Swan said in today’s statement. A report last week showed the
 jobless rate  held at 5.1 percent in June from the revised
reading for May, almost half the level of the U.S.  
 Swan said the government remains committed to capping
spending growth at 2 percent a year on average until the surplus
reaches 1 percent of gross domestic product.  
 Gillard pledged to call an election this year after her
elevation triggered a rebound in opinion polls for the ruling
Labor Party. Speculation the ballot may be announced as early as
this week intensified after Governor-General  Quentin Bryce , whom
the prime minister must ask to dissolve parliament, altered her
travel plans.  
 Mining Tax  
 Since taking over from Rudd, Gillard has struck a deal with
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , Rio Tinto Group and Xstrata Plc to water down
the mining tax to a 30 percent levy on coal and iron ore
projects and vowed to reach a consensus on action to tackle
climate change. No new climate policy has been announced.  
 The revenue numbers behind the scaled back levy were based
on modeling provided by BHP, Rio and Xstrata, Treasury Secretary
 Ken Henry  told a Senate committee yesterday.  
 Swan reiterated that the mining tax will contribute A$10.5
billion in the two years from July 1, 2012, to fund roads, rail
and ports, tax cuts for small businesses and government
contributions to pension savings for low-income workers.  
 A Westpac Banking Corp. and Melbourne Institute survey of
1,200 consumers conducted between July 5 and July 11 and jumped
11.1 percent to 113.1 points.  
 Bryce’s decision to delay travel boosted the likelihood the
national election will be held on Aug. 28, the Sydney Morning
Herald newspaper reported yesterday after Gillard signaled that
a vote announcement could be made within days.  
 The governor-general will be out of Australia from July 17-
21, according to a statement released by her office two days ago.
