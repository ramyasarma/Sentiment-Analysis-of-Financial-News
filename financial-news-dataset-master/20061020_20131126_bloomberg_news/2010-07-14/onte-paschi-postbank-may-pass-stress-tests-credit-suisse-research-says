             Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA
and Deutsche Postbank AG are unlikely to fail European stress
tests, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  
 Credit Suisse said in a July 8 research note that the two
lenders may be forced to raise capital. The Swiss brokerage said
in a note published today that it revised its research after new
information from the Committee of European Banking Supervisors.
According to its new research, Monte Paschi and Deutsche
Postbank are among the majority of banks that will likely pass
the stress tests, the note said.
