             Brazil’s real fell from a two-month
high as declines in stock-index futures and a more-than-forecast
drop in U.S. retail sales sparked concern the global economic
recovery may be slowing.  
 The real dropped 0.3 percent to 1.7629 per dollar at 9:24
a.m. New York time, from 1.7570 yesterday.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2
percent. Brazil’s Bovespa index fell 0.8 percent. Sales at U.S.
retailers fell in June 0.5 percent, following a 1.1 percent May
drop, Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington.  
 “The gyrations in anxiety about global growth is what is
driving the real,” said  Roberto Melzi , a strategist at Barclays
Plc in New York. “We’ve had a strong rebound in equities in
recent weeks, but if this falters, it shouldn’t be a surprise to
see a decline in the real.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 11.23 percent.
