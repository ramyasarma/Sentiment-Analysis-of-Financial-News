             Komatsu Ltd., the world’s second-
largest construction equipment maker, gained as much as 6
percent in early Tokyo trading after raising its full-year
profit forecast to reflect increasing demand.  
 The shares touched 1,799 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
higher than yesterday’s 1,698 yen closing price, making the
stock the biggest gainer in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.
