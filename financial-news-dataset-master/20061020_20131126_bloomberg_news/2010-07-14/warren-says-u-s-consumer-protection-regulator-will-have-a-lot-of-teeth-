             Elizabeth Warren , the Harvard
University professor credited with conceiving the consumer
financial-protection regulator, said the agency included in the
Wall Street rules overhaul will have “a lot of teeth.”  
 The agency, which will combine consumer watchdogs from
several regulators into a central bureau at the Treasury
Department, may change the way credit cards, mortgages and
other debt are sold, Warren said today in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop with  Betty Liu .”  
 “It has a lot of capacity to reshape the consumer credit
market in a way that just works, becomes a real functioning
market again, a market where consumers can see the products and
say, ‘Oh, that’s how much it costs that’s how much risk is
associated with it,’ and make comparisons,” she said.  
 Warren, who is serving as chairman of the congressional
panel overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, has been
touted as a possible head of the new regulator by Representative
 Barney Frank , the Massachusetts Democrat who led lawmakers in
crafting the rewrite of financial-industry regulation. She
declined to say whether she’d be interested in the job.  
 “Right now this thing still hasn’t passed Congress,” she
said in the interview.  
 The Senate may vote as soon as tomorrow to approve the
legislation and send it to President  Barack Obama  for his
signature. The House approved the measure last month.  
 Lobbyists  
 Lobbyists including  Travis Plunkett  of the Washington-based
Consumer Federation of America have lauded Warren for leading
efforts to create the new regulator, which she said will force
lenders to alter their business practices.  
 “There’s going to be some changing in the industry because
the old model of let me pretend to charge you with one price but
hit you with all the fees on the back end is really going to
have to go away,” Warren said in the BTV interview.  
 Business lobbyists say the consumer agency should be headed
by someone who understands the credit industry.  
 “We are concerned about the overreach of this bill to
regulate mid-sized and large businesses that had nothing to do
with the financial crisis,” said  Tom Quaadman , vice president
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center on Capital Markets
Competitiveness.
