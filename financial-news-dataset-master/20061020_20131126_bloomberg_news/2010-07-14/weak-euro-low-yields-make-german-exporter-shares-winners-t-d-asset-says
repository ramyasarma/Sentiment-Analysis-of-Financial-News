             German exporter stocks are
attractive because they benefit from a weaker euro and a decline
in bond yields that has made it cheaper for them to borrow,
according to  T&D Asset Management Co.   
 Long-term yields in Europe’s largest economy may decline
even further after the release of stress tests on the region’s
banks this month, said  Yuichi Onsen , who helps manage the
equivalent of $28 billion as chief strategist at the unit of
Japan’s biggest listed life  insurer  in Tokyo.  
 “Germany is the only winner in the euro zone,” Onsen said
in an interview with Bloomberg yesterday. Exporters can benefit
from the weakening euro and lower debt yields, he said.  
 Onsen recommended the shares of automobile, machinery and
electronics companies. Germany’s  DAX Index  has gained 3.9
percent this year, compared with a 14 percent decline for
Spain’s 35 IBEX Index and a 7.6 percent drop for France’s CAC 40,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The euro has weakened 11 percent against the dollar in 2010
and 15 percent versus the yen. The single currency traded at
113.21 yen as of 12:52 p.m. in Tokyo after sliding to an eight-
year low of 107.32 on June 29 on concern Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis will derail the region’s growth.  
 Germany’s 10-year bund  yielded  2.63 percent after falling
to 2.50 percent on June 8, the lowest in at least 21 years.  
 Bund yields are likely to remain low after European Union
regulators carry out stress tests on 91 banks and release the
results on July 23, Onsen said. “Yields won’t likely rise this
year,” he said.  
 The stress tests are unlikely be a cause of concern about
the Greek debt holdings of German and French banks after Greece
cut its budget deficit more than planned in the first half,
Onsen said.  
 Companies on the DAX are  projected  to post a 29 percent
jump in earnings per share this year, according to analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

                          July 14 (Bloomberg) -- Sean Callow, a currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp, talks with Bloomberg's Linzie Janis about European Union stress tests for banks and the outlook for the euro.
     The euro rose for a second day versus the yen after Greece sold Treasury bills at an interest rate below the 5 percent charged by the European Union when it rescued the nation from default. Callow speaks from Sydney. (Source: Bloomberg)
