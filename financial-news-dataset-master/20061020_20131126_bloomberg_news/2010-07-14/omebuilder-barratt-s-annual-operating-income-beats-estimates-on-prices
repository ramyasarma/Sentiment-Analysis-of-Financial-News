             Barratt Developments Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest homebuilder by volume, reported full-year operating
profit that beat analysts’ estimates after cutting costs and
selling more expensive homes and fewer apartments.  
 Profit for the 12 months through June was at least 85
million pounds ($129 million), the London-based company said in
a statement today. The average estimate of seven analysts was
75.9 million pounds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “This improved operating performance, combined with our
success in agreeing terms on higher-margin land, means that the
group is well positioned to secure further margin growth in what
continues to be a challenging market,” Chief Executive Officer
 Mark Clare  said in the statement.  
 The U.K. homebuilding market is being held back by
“constraints on the availability of mortgages and the overall
economic concerns,” Clare said on a conference call with
reporters. Mortgage approvals are at about half the level they
were at the peak of the housing boom in 2007.  
 Operating profit in the second half equaled about 5.5
percent of sales, compared with 1.8 percent a year earlier, the
construction company said.  
 Fewer Mortgages  
 U.K. house prices fell the most in four months in June as
supply increased, Halifax said on July 8. Banks expect to award
fewer mortgages in the third quarter as lending conditions may
tighten, the Bank of England said a week earlier.  
 Barratt fell 0.7 percent to 104.3 pence in London trading,
bringing the decline for the past six months to 24 percent. In
February 2007, before the U.K.’s worst housing crash in 25
years, the shares were priced at 845 pence.  
 Barratt sold 11,377 homes in the year and said that forward
sales, or properties paid for but not yet built, rose 27 percent
to 591.7 million pounds as of June 30. Barratt bought 13,359
plots of land, boosting the total it owns to 50,700, it said.  
 Barratt’s net debt was 375 million pounds at the end of
June, about 230 million pounds lower than six months earlier,
Barratt said. Average selling prices rose 11 percent to 174,000
pounds as houses accounted for 60 percent of sales compared with
46 percent a year earlier, the company said.  
 Barratt is scheduled to publish its full results for fiscal
2010 on Sept. 8.
