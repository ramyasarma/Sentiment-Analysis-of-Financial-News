             E.ON AG , Germany’s largest utility,
completed installing wind turbines at its 207-megawatt Roedsand-
2 offshore wind park in Denmark and expects it will reach full
capacity in August, about two months earlier than planned.  
 The facility installed many of the Siemens AG turbines at a
rate of about one a day and the majority now supply power to the
Danish grid,  Frank Mastiaux , head of E.ON’s renewable power
division, said today in an interview in Duesseldorf.  
 Roedsand-2 will produce power at full output from Aug. 15,
compared with an earlier estimate of October, E.ON said today in
a note distributed by the Nord Pool power exchange.  
 E.ON made an investment decision on the project in April
2008. It won a government tender to build the wind farm in 2006
with Danish partner Dong Energy A/S, which subsequently sold its
80 percent stake in the venture to E.ON.
