             Manchester City striker  Emmanuel Adebayor  sued a Togolese journalist over a report that the
soccer player asked his teammates in  Togo ’s national side to
postpone a match and attend a party he organized.  
 Adebayor is seeking damages of 100 million CFA francs
($194,000) for slander, said the reporter, Agboklou Koami
Prosper, who denied any wrongdoing. The case will be heard in a
court in the capital, Lome, today.  
 “I will go to the court this morning without any fear
because I have the evidence that I have not slandered” Adebayor,
Prosper, who works for Radio Victoire FM in Lome, said in a
phone interview.  
 Adebayor’s lawyer, Attoh Messan, didn’t answer his mobile
phone today when called for comment.  
 Prosper said Adebayor organized a party at a nightclub in
Lome on July 1, the day that Togo was scheduled to play Chad in
a qualifying match for the Africa Cup of Nations tournament. The
two sides drew 2-2.  
 The game was the first international match Togo has played
since its team was attacked while attending this year’s Africa
Cup of Nations finals in Angola. Separatist rebels shot at a bus
the team was traveling in, killing the driver, Togo’s assistant
coach and the squad’s press officer.  
 Adebayor announced his retirement from international
football in April following the attack.
