             India’s stocks advanced to the
highest level in 29 months, led by Tata Steel Ltd. and the
nation’s biggest exporters amid signs a global economic rebound
may drive demand for their products.  
 Tata Steel , which gets more than 80 percent of its sales
abroad, climbed for the fifth day.  Asian stocks  rose today after
Intel Corp., world’s biggest chipmaker, reported record second-
quarter revenue.  Wipro Ltd. , which derives about three-quarters
of its sales from software exports, advanced.  
 “Intel’s forecast is a sentiment boost for the global
economy,” said  Alex Mathews , head of research at Geojit BNP
Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi. “The international
cues are supporting the Indian markets. Indian exporters are
likely to benefit if the global recovery is strong.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 85.07, or 0.5 percent, to 18,070.97 at 11:29 a.m. in
Mumbai, poised for its highest close since Feb. 15, 2008. The
measure is advancing for a fifth day after the International
Monetary Fund said India’s economy may expand this year at the
fastest pace since 2007.  
 The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.7 percent to 5,436.20. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.7 percent
to 2,302.98. The gauges are extending a rally as the Nifty index,
which tracks the 50 biggest companies, surpassed 5,400 yesterday,
suggesting it can extend gains to the next resistance level of
5,474 and then to 5,517 Mathews said.

 Tata Steel added 1.3 percent to 515.35 rupees. Wipro
increased 0.8 percent to 407.1 rupees, paring yesterday’s 1.4
percent loss.  
 The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index  rose 1.3 percent, on course for
its highest close since June 22. Intel boosted its profit
forecast for the year to a record after corporations resumed
spending on computers.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  11.2 billion rupees  of Indian
equities on July 12, increasing total investments in the stocks
this year to 373.5 billion rupees, according to the nation’s
market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.
