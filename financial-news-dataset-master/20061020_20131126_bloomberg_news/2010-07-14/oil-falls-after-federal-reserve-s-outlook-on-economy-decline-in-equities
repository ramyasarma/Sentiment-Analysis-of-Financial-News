             Crude oil fell for a second day
after China’s economic growth eased and the Federal Reserve said
the U.S. outlook has “softened,” adding to concern fuel demand
will slow in the world’s two biggest energy consumers.  
 Oil declined as Asian stocks dropped from a three-week high,
following a pullback in U.S. equities. China, the second-largest
energy user, posted growth of 10.3 percent in the quarter ended
June, down from 11.9 percent in the first three months of the
year, signaling a deeper second-half slowdown that may add to
risks for the global economy.  
 “There are a growing number of indicators that point to a
slowing U.S. economy,” said  David Land , chief market analyst at
CMC Markets Ltd. in Sydney. “The Federal Reserve’s revised
assessment of the economy and weaker-than-expected retail sales
figures put a dampener on things.”  
 Crude for August delivery fell as much as 54 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $76.50 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $76.66 at 2:38 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract slipped 11 cents to
settle at $77.04 after reaching $78.15, the highest intraday
price since June 29.  
 U.S.  retail sales  dropped 0.5 percent in June, easing for a
second month, the Commerce Department said yesterday. A report
today may show June industrial production declined, based on a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  
 Inflation in China, Asia’s second-largest economy after
Japan, cooled to 2.9 percent in June and industrial output rose
less than estimated, the statistics bureau said today. The data
indicated the government succeeded in measures to temper growth
and offered Premier  Wen Jiabao  more room to scale back
restrictions on bank lending in coming months.  
 Fuel Supplies  
 Oil has lost 3.5 percent this year amid speculation rising
supplies in the U.S. signaled a slowdown in consumption.  
 Fuel demand  dropped  4 percent to 18.8 million barrels a day
in the week ended July 9, the biggest one-week decline since
March, according to data from the Energy Department yesterday.  
 Gasoline stockpiles climbed for a third week as  production
jumped  to a record 9.51 million barrels a day. Stockpiles
reached 221 million barrels, 4.3 percent above the five-year
average, the report showed.  
 Commercially held  crude inventories  fell 5.06 million
barrels to 353.1 million, the biggest drawdown since September,
the department said.  Refineries  boosted utilization to 90.5
percent of capacity, the highest rate since January 2008.  
 Stockpiles of distillate fuel, including heating oil and
diesel, increased 2.9 million barrels to 162.6 million, 24
percent above the five-year average.  
 Brent crude for August settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange fell as much as 58 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $76.19 a barrel. It was at $76.35 at 2:36 p.m. Singapore time.
The contract, which expires today, gained 12 cents yesterday to
settle at $76.77. The more actively traded September future was
down 43 cents at $76.23.
