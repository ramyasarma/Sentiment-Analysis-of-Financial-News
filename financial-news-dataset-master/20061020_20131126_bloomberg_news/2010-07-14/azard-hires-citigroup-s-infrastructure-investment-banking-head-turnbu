             Lazard Ltd ., the investment bank
whose clients this year have included the government of Greece,
hired  Jonathan Turnbull , the head of Citigroup Inc.’s
infrastructure investment-banking group.  
 Turnbull, 42, joined as a managing director in Lazard’s
energy, power, and infrastructure group, the Bermuda-based firm
said in a statement today. He worked at Citigroup and
predecessor Salomon Brothers since 1990.  
 Lazard’s recent clients include the Long Island Power
Authority and Papua New Guinea on its $15 billion liquefied
natural gas development project, the firm said. The firm
counseled  Transurban Group , the Australian toll-road operator,
on its defense against an unsolicited bid from a group including
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Ontario Teachers’
Pension Plan, Lazard said.  
 George Bilicic , head of Lazard’s energy, power, and
infrastructure group, recently hired  Thomas Suozzi , the former
county executive in New York’s Nassau County, as a special
adviser.  
 Lazard also rehired  Felix Rohatyn , who counseled New York
City during its financial crisis in the 1970’s, as an adviser to
Chief Executive Officer  Kenneth Jacobs .
