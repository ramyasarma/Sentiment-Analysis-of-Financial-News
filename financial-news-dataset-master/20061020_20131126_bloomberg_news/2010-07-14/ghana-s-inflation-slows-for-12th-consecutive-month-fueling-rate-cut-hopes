             Ghana’s  inflation rate fell for the
12th consecutive month in June, fueling expectations that the
central bank will cut interest rates on July 16.  
 Inflation slowed to 9.5 percent from 10.7 percent a month
earlier, Grace Bediako, a statistician at the Ghana Statistical
Service, told reporters today in the capital, Accra.  
 “Everything still supports a Bank of Ghana rate cut of at
least 100 basis points on Friday,” said  Razia Khan , a London-
based Africa analyst with Standard Chartered Plc.  
 The Bank of Ghana lowered its policy rate to 15 percent in
April and has cut a total of 3.5 percentage points since
November as inflation has slowed from a five-year peak of 20.7
percent in June. Price-growth has eased after Ghana’s cedi,
which fell 15 percent against the U.S. dollar in the first half
of 2009, gained 3 percent over the past 12 months.  
 The inflation rate may rise in the second half of the year
as the government raises the wages of state employees and the
West African nation starts to produce oil,  Sampson Akligoh , an
analyst with Accra-based Databank Financial Services, said in an
e-mailed comment. He increased the upper limit of his forecast
for year-end inflation to 11.5 percent from 11 percent.  
 The latest inflation figure shows Ghana is “bringing the
fiscal situation under control,” said Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  in a statement handed to reporters in Accra. The
government reaffirms its commitment to ensuring “a lowering of
interest rates” and stabilization of the cedi, he said.
