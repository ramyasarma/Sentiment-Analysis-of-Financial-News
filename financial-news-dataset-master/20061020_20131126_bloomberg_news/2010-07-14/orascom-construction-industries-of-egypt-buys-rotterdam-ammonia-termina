             Orascom Construction Industries , the
biggest publicly traded builder in the Middle East, acquired
MICRO Chemie BV, which owns and operates ammonia storage tanks
in Rotterdam, as it expands its fertilizer distribution network.  
 MICRO Chemie has a 25-year lease renewable for another 25
years on a Rotterdam port terminal, which opened in 2002, Cairo-
based Orascom said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.
The value of the transaction wasn’t disclosed.  
 “The acquisition is a very small one,” said Omar Taha, a
Cairo-based analyst at  Beltone Financial . “However, the company
continues to expand its global presence, formulating an
integrated global fertilizer producer, with a vast distribution
network.”  
 The terminal has a permit to receive up to 600,000 tons of
ammonia and deliver up to 550,000 tons and has waterway access
that can accommodate large tankers and smaller barges. It can
deliver to France, Germany and the Netherlands on the River
Rhine and is also accessible by rail, Orascom said.  
 Royal DSM NV agreed in March to sell two unprofitable
agrochemical businesses to Orascom Construction Industries for
310 million euros ($418 million), allowing Orascom to acquire
more fertilizer companies in Egypt.  
 Shares of Orascom Construction rose less than 0.1 percent
to 232 Egyptian pounds at 11:55 a.m. in Cairo today, valuing the
company at 48.1 billion pounds ($8.44 billion).
