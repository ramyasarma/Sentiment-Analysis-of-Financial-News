             EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG
will boost its stake in Czech power utility PRE Group to 69.9
percent from 28.5 percent by swapping its stake in a district
heating company, Financial Times Deutschland reported.  
 Germany-based EnBW will give up its holding of about 24
percent in heat supplier Prazska Teplarenska in exchange for a
stake Honor Invest owns in PRE, the newspaper said, citing
several unidentified people familiar with the matter.
