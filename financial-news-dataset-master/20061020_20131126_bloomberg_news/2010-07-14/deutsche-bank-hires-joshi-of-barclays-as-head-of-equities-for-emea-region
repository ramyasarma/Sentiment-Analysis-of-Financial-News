             Deutsche Bank AG  hired  Dixit Joshi 
as head of equities for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  
 Joshi is joining from  Barclays Capital , the investment
banking unit of Barclays Plc, where he was the head of equities
for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Frankfurt-based bank
said in an e-mailed statement today. He will report to Deutsche
Bank’s Global Head of Equities  Garth Ritchie  and will be based
in London.  
 Joshi oversaw Barclays’ resumption of European stock
trading last year, as the London-based bank returned to a
business it abandoned in 1997 when it sold Barclays de Zoete
Wedd’s money-losing European equities and corporate finance
unit.  
 Before joining Barclays in 2003, Joshi worked at Credit
Suisse First Boston. He will start in his newly created role at
Deutsche Bank in October.
