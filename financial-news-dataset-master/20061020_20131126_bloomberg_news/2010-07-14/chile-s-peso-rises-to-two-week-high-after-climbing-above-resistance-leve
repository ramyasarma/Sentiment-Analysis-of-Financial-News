             Chile’s peso gained the most in two
weeks after breaching a technical resistance level as emerging
market stocks rose for a fifth day amid signs of global growth.  
 The peso strengthened 0.7 percent to 531.65 per U.S.
dollar, the biggest gain among seven Latin American currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, after earlier touching a two-week high of
530.95.  
 “It would appear that the peso broke through a strong
level at 534 and that there were stop-losses at that level, so
sales orders were executed,” said  Luis Morales , a currency
trader at Banco de Credito & Inversiones in Santiago.  
 Chile’s peso previously traded in a range between 534 and
549 all month. The currency fell 0.4 percent earlier today as
copper, Chile’s biggest export, declined before recovering after
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index climbed as much as 1 percent as
Intel Corp. reported record second-quarter sales and Singapore
raised its 2010 economic growth forecast.  
 The median forecast of 38 traders and investors in a
central bank survey published today was that the peso would be
at 535 in seven days and rise to 530 in the next three months.  
 The one-year interest rate in pesos rose for a third day to
a 17-month high of 3.22 percent as traders  positioned  themselves
for a forecast half-point interest rate increase tomorrow. All
except one of 16 economists in a  Bloomberg survey  estimate the
central bank to lift its benchmark rate to 1.5 percent.
