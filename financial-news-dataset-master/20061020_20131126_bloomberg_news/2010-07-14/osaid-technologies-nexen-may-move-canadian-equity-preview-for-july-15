             Most  Canadian stocks  fell as oil
producers declined after two indexes of U.S. regional economic
activity failed to meet economists’ forecasts.  
 Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
dropped 1.2 percent as crude futures slipped. Nexen Inc., an oil
and gas producer with operations on  five continents , gained 3.6
percent after reporting earnings that topped the average analyst
forecast by 55 percent. Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest
base-metals and coal producer, lost 2 percent as economic growth
slowed in China.  
 Among  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  stocks, 129
declined, 96 advanced and four were unchanged. The equity
benchmark decreased 6.71 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,613.45 at
3:15 p.m. in Toronto.  
 “The lower manufacturing data out of the U.S. plays a big
part just because we’re linked so closely to the U.S. market,”
said  Arthur Salzer , who oversees about C$160 million ($153
million) as a money manager at MacNicol & Associates Asset
Management Inc. “What we’re seeing is a muted recovery. When
you combine that with the slower economic growth coming out of
China, we’re not going to have an overheating anytime soon.”  
 The S&P/TSX had built on last week’s 3.3 percent rally,
climbing 0.4 percent over the past three days as Alcoa Inc., CSX
Corp. and Intel Corp. kicked off the earnings-reporting season
by surpassing analyst estimates. Second-quarter earnings for
S&P/TSX materials and energy stocks are forecast to increase 48
percent and 33 percent, respectively, from last year, according
to National Bank of Canada. Those two industries make up 46
percent of Canadian stocks by market value.  
 U.S. Manufacturing  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s  Empire State Index ,
which tracks manufacturing activity in New York and adjacent
areas, fell to 5.1 in July, lower than the median economist
estimate of 18. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
general economic index, which covers Delaware and parts of
Pennsylvania and New Jersey, dropped to its lowest level since
August 2009.  
 Economic growth in China slowed to a year-over-year gain of
10.3 percent in the second quarter, down from 11.9 percent in
the first quarter, the country’s National Bureau of Statistics
said.  
 Metals and oil declined, with crude oil retreating 0.5
percent in New York.  
 Suncor lost 1.2 percent to C$32.44. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-largest energy company by market
value, decreased 0.9 percent to C$36.45. Penn West Energy Trust,
the country’s second-biggest energy trust, slipped 0.9 percent
to C$20.51.  
 Earnings Surge  
 Nexen rose 3.6 percent to C$22.14 after reporting net
income of C$255 million ($248 million), a 12-fold increase from
the second quarter of 2009. The operating loss at its Long Lake
oil sands project dropped 67 percent.  
 Fertilizer companies surged as agricultural commodities
climbed on concerns hot, dry weather may damage U.S. crops.
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, the world’s largest fertilizer
producer, increased 4.3 percent to C$101.13. Agrium Inc.,
Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer, rallied 4.4 percent
to C$62.  
 Producers of  base metals and coal  slumped on the economic
data from China, the world’s largest consumer of copper and
producer of steel.  
 Teck retreated  2 percent to C$33.81. Copper producer Taseko
Mines Ltd. fell 2.7 percent to C$4.20, ending a seven-day streak
of gains.  
 Acquisition  
 Molybdenum producer Thompson Creek Metals Co. sank 6.2
percent to C$9.29 after agreeing to buy Terrane Metals Corp. in
a deal Thompson Creek valued at C$650 million.  Terrane  soared 15
percent to C$1.34 after surging as much as 18 percent, the most
in almost eight months. Goldcorp Inc., the gold producer that
owns 58 percent of Terrane’s outstanding shares, dropped 1
percent to C$42.58.  
 BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. advanced 1.4
percent to C$57.40 after rival Apple Inc. scheduled a press
conference for tomorrow to discuss its iPhone 4 smartphone.
Consumer Reports said this week it wouldn’t recommend the phone
because of problems with reception.  
 Gammon Gold Inc., which mines in Mexico, jumped 6.9 percent
to C$5.87 after saying production at its Ocampo mine increased
in the second quarter.
