             Peru’s sol fell from a 23-month high
after the central bank made a record purchase of dollars to curb
gains in the local currency.  
 The sol dropped 0.2 percent to 2.8210 per U.S. dollar at
4:02 p.m. New York time, from 2.8158 yesterday, the strongest
level since Aug. 7, 2008.  
 The central bank  bought  $493.5 million at an average 2.8158
soles per dollar, it said on its website, topping its last
record daily purchase of $479 million in January 2008. The
central bank has bought $4.28 billion this year as a faster-
than-forecast economic rebound forces policy makers to raise
borrowing costs.  
 “It’s natural that a growing economy, where there are
long-term investment projects, is going to receive more currency
inflows,” said  Ricardo Villamonte , head trader at Banco de
Credito del Peru in Lima. “The central bank has been paying
less for the dollars it buys, maybe to allow the sol to
strengthen in line with the fundamentals, though at a pace
determined by the bank.”  
 Long-term capital inflows may rise to the equivalent of 5.2
percent of GDP this year, compared with 4.8 percent last year,
the central bank said in a June 18 report.  
 The central bank began buying dollars earlier than usual
today after a 0.3 percent gain yesterday, Villamonte said. The
bank tends to buy dollars toward the end of the trading session.  
 ‘Early Intervention’  
 “The early intervention was a bit of a surprise, but
responds to the break below 2.81 as heavy inflows are coming
into the country on account of strong growth and expected
tightening to control inflation,” New York-based 4Cast Inc said
in an e-mailed report.  
 The central bank raised its  reference rate  by a quarter-
percentage point to 2 percent last week, the third straight
increase.  
 Gross domestic product  may have risen at a “double-digit”
rate in the second quarter, and might grow 6 percent this year,
Finance Minister  Mercedes Araoz  said July 12.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 5.45 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s local
unit. That’s the lowest yield in eight weeks.  
 Foreign investors are buying bonds in emerging markets with
solid macroeconomic fundamentals such as Peru, said Scotiabank
analyst  Estefany Castillo  in a July 12 report.
