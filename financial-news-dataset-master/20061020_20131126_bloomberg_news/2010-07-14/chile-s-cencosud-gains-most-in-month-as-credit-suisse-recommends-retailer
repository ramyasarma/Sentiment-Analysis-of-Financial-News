             Cencosud SA  rose the most in 18
months after Credit Suisse Group AG named the Santiago-based
company as its preferred Chilean retailer, initiating coverage
with an “outperform” rating on earnings growth prospects.  
 Chile’s largest retailer by sales rose 5.2 percent to a
record 2,694.3 pesos, the biggest advance since January 2009.  
 The operator of home-improvement outlets, department stores
and supermarkets is Credit Suisse’s top pick among Chilean
retailers, analysts  Antonio Gonzalez ,  Vanessa Quiroga  and  Marcel Moraes  wrote in a research note. They rated rivals  Empresas La
Polar SA  “outperform” and  SACI Falabella  and  Ripley Corp SA 
“neutral.”  
 “Cencosud took the 2009 crisis as a chance to make a pause
on its aggressive expansion phase and emerged as a much stronger
operator,” they wrote. “We forecast profitability levels above
historic standards for the following years.”  
 La Polar increased 1.3 percent, Ripley gained 1 percent and
Falabella climbed 0.9 percent. Chile’s Ipsa index gained 0.2
percent.
