             Vegetable oil imports by India, the
second-biggest user after China, dropped for a sixth month in
June as rising domestic inventories deterred buyers.  
 Purchases fell to 732,232 metric tons from 780,679 tons a
year earlier, the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India said
today in an e-mailed statement. Stockpiles were at 1.11 million
tons on July 1 from 1.075 million on June 1, the group said.  
 Imports may jump as much as 24 percent to 2.6 million tons
in the quarter ending Oct. 31 to meet demand during the festival
season,  Govindlal G. Patel , who has been trading vegetable oils
for four decades, said yesterday in an interview. The price of
Malaysian palm oil, which touched an eight-month low last week,
may rise 18 percent to 2,800 ringgit a ton by November, he said.  
 “The declining trend will be reversed in the coming months
as domestic supply is going down,” said  B.V. Mehta , executive
director of the association. “Imports are bound to pick up as
demand increases because of the festivals.”  
 Palm oil for delivery in September gained as much as 1.3
percent to 2,384 ringgit ($746) and traded at 2,374 ringgit at
4:50 p.m. local time on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange.  
 India overtook China as the biggest buyer of the commodity
in 2009, helping the edible oil to a 57 percent annual gain. The
two countries, along with Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia, mark
their important festivals in the quarter ending September, with
communal meals stoking edible oils consumption.  
 Crude palm oil purchases by India advanced 19 percent to
421,462 tons in June from a year earlier, the association said.
Imports of soybean oil and sunflower oil were 192,649 tons and
34,559 tons each, it said.  
 Incoming shipments of palm oil may exceed 500,000 tons on
 average  each month through October, with soybean oil purchases
at about 200,000-250,000 tons, Patel said.  
 Vegetable oil imports in the November-June period fell 4
percent to 5.58 million tons, the association said.  
 Palm oil makes up almost 80 percent of the purchases.
