             Cyrte Investments BV may have  sold
330 million reais  ($187.8 million) of voting stock in Vivo
Participacoes SA yesterday, Valor Economico reported, without
saying where it got the information.  
 Morgan Stanley coordinated the sale of 2.7 percent of the
Brazilian mobile-phone company’s common shares at 89 reais each,
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.   
 Officials at Delta Lloyd NV, which owns 85 percent of
Cyrte, didn’t immediately return an email and phone call from
Bloomberg News requesting comment today.
