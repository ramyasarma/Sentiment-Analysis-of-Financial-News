             Vontobel Holding AG , a Swiss private
bank, is marketing structured notes that track the stocks of
fashion companies including Hugo Boss AG, Polo Ralph Lauren
Corp. and Hermes International SCA.  
 The two-year note is aimed at private banks and asset
managers, according to  Georg Vonwattenwyl , Vontobel’s Zurich-
based head of financial products distribution. The bank will
issue as much as 20 million euros ($25 million) of the  notes ,
which start trading July 16 on the SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd. and
Germany’s Stuttgart and Frankfurt bourses.  
 Luxury goods companies in Europe are expected to post sales
growth of 7 percent on average this year, after slumping 6.6
percent in 2009, according to a Vontobel report. Fashion
companies returned about 50 percent last year, according to the
Swiss bank, almost double the 27 percent gain in the  MSCI Europe
Index  of 461 stocks.  
 “We have seen some interest in the fashion story this
year,” Vonwattenwyl said. “The global development of wealth
and the demand for luxury products, particularly in Asia, should
benefit these stocks in the future.”  
 Vontobel’s notes will return to investors any gain or loss
on the basket of 11 stocks that also includes Bulgari SpA,
Burberry Group Plc, Coach Inc., Cie Financiere Richemont SA,
Louis Vitton Moet Hennessy SA, Swatch Group AG, Tiffany & Co.
and Tod’s SpA.  
 The Swiss bank issued similar notes in 2004 that earned
20.3 percent for buyers that held them for all of their 18-month
term.
