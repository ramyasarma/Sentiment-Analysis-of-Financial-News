             Apple Inc.  is increasingly likely to
recall its iPhone 4 after complaints about poor reception and a
critical review from Consumer Reports, according to a betting
company that tracks odds for such events.  
 Paddy Power Plc , Ireland’s biggest bookmaker, said the
chances that Apple will ultimately recall the phone have
increased following what it described a “betting frenzy” after
the Consumer Reports review. The consumer organization said on
July 12 it wouldn’t recommend the phone because of its tendency
to lose signal strength when held in a certain way.  
 “If the current betting trends are to be believed, it now
seems certain that a recall is in the cards,” Paddy Power said
in a press release.  Natalie Kerris , an Apple spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately return messages left outside of business hours.  
 Paddy Power first offered odds of 2-to-1 against a recall,
meaning a bet on a recall would pay $2 plus the initial $1 if
such an event occurred. Now those odds are 4-to-6, meaning a
winning bet of $1 would pay $1.66 if a recall were to occur.  
 Consumer Reports said it wouldn’t recommend the latest
iPhone until the signal problem is fixed, though the device
otherwise received high ratings. The test results showed that
when a user covers the phone’s lower-left side, where two parts
of the antenna meet, the loss of signal strength may lead to
dropped calls in areas where  AT&T Inc. ’s coverage is weak,
Consumer Reports said.  
 On July 2, Apple blamed the problem on software that helps
display the phone’s signal strength, and has promised to issue a
free fix to iPhone owners. It hasn’t specified when that fix
will be available.  
 Recall Costs  
 Analysts have started to estimate the impact of an iPhone
recall on the company’s earnings.  Toni Sacconaghi , an analyst at
Sanford Bernstein & Co. in New York, put the price tag at $1.5
billion, though he said a recall is “highly unlikely.” A more
likely step would be issuing rubber cases to cover the phone’s
bottom-left corner, which would cost Apple $1 or less per phone,
he said in a report.  
 Vijay Rakesh , an analyst with Sterne Agee & Leach in
Chicago, estimated that a recall would cost Apple less than $100
million.  
 Apple rose $2.41 to $254.21 at 11:15 a.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock had risen 19
percent this year before today.
