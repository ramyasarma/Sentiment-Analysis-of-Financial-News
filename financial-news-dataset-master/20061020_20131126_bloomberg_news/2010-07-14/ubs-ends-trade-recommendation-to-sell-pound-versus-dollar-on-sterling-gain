             UBS AG ended a trade recommendation
to sell the pound against the dollar after the U.K. currency
rose, surpassing the bank’s upper limit to protect against
greater losses.  
 “We exit our short pound-dollar trade,”  Gareth Berry , a
strategist at the Swiss bank in Singapore, wrote today in an
investor note. “The rationale for being short sterling is still
intact,” he said.  
 The pound rose 0.7 percent to $1.5281 as of 11:48 a.m. in
London.
