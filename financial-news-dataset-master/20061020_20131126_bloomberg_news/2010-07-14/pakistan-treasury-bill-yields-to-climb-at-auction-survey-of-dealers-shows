             Pakistan’s central bank will sell
100 billion rupees ($1.17 billion) of treasury bills in an
auction today at yields higher than in the previous sale,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 The  State Bank of Pakistan  will offer benchmark six-month
treasury bills at 12.35 percent, according to the median
forecast of eight money-market dealers and one economist. It
sold similar-maturity notes at 12.30 percent in the previous
auction on June 16. The monetary authority will sell three-month
paper at 12.14 percent, compared with 12.10 percent, and one-
year notes at 12.45 percent, compared with 12.41 percent.  
 The central bank plans to  raise  535 billion rupees from
treasury bills this quarter, according to its website. It kept
its benchmark discount rate unchanged at 12.5 percent in the
last review in May, after  inflation  accelerated to a three-month
high of 13.26 percent in April. Policy makers cut the discount
rate three times last year by a cumulative 2.5 percentage points.
The central bank is due to review the discount rate this month.  
 Treasury-bill auctions, held every two weeks, are an
indication of the central bank’s stance on lending to commercial
banks. The central bank will unveil the results of the sale
after 2 p.m. local time. Pakistan raised 115.4 billion rupees at
the previous auction.
