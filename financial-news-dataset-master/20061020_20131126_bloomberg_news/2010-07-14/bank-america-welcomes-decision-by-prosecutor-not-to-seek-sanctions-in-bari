             Bank of America Merrill Lynch said
it welcomed a decision by a court in Bari, Italy, which decided
not to seek sanctions against the bank for its role in municipal
derivatives contracts. The bank said in an e-mailed statement
that the court “recognized the efficiency of the organizational
model adopted by Bank of America.”
