             Vestas Wind Systems A/S , the world’s
largest wind-turbine maker, plans to hire 850 workers at its
Colorado plants in the United States over the next year and a
half after winning orders in North America.  
 “Throughout 2009 we didn’t see any orders in the U.S.
whatsoever,” Vestas spokesman Michael Holm said in a telephone
interview from the company’s Randers, Denmark, headquarters.
“That is changing. We see the market is easing up.”  
 Vestas lost a net 82 million euros ($104 million) in the
first quarter after tighter financing led customers to delay
renewable-energy projects. The company  said  on April 28 that
renewed market momentum will lead it to hire 3,400 workers
worldwide this year, a majority of them in the U.S., where
Vestas operates three plants and will open a fourth next year.  
 “We don’t see a fall in demand for our products,” Holm
said. “But to some extent customers are still facing financing
challenges, so sometimes negotiations on firm orders take
longer.”  
 Vestas has announced several orders for wind turbines in
the United States and Canada this year, including the company’s
largest ever order, for turbines totaling 1,500 megawatts to be
installed and maintained in North America, South America and
Europe in 2011 and 2012 for  EDP Renovaveis SA .  
 The hiring of 850 workers was reported earlier today by the
Coloradoan.
