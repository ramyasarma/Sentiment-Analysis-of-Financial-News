             Bank of America Corp.  hired ex-
Deutsche Bank AG investment banker  Henry Ayliffe  in Australia,
said a person with direct knowledge of the move.  
 Ayliffe, who led Deutsche Bank’s general industries team in
Hong Kong until this year, will run advisory for small companies
in Australia at Bank of America, said the person, declining to
be identified because the hiring hasn’t been publicly announced.  
 Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank has lost at least three
senior bankers in Asia since April including  Peter O’Malley , who
led Asian natural resources coverage, people familiar with the
matter said in May. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America is the fifth-ranked merger adviser in Australia this
year, Bloomberg data show. It wasn’t in the top ten in 2009.  
 Ayliffe, who worked at Merrill Lynch & Co. before Bank of
America bought the brokerage in January 2009, will start in
Sydney next month as a managing director, the person said.  
 Lucinda Horne , a spokeswoman for Bank of America in Sydney,
declined to comment.
