             Sales at U.S. retailers fell in June
for a second month, indicating the expansion will moderate in
the second half of 2010, economists said before a report today.  
 Purchases  decreased 0.3 percent following a 1.2 percent
drop in May, according to the  median  estimate of 75 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Other reports may show the cost of
imported goods declined and inventories climbed.  
 Target Corp.  and  Gap Inc.  were among retailers whose sales
trailed forecasts, signaling a lack of jobs and a loss of wealth
are restraining spending, the biggest part of the economy. The
financial turmoil caused by the European debt crisis and cooling
inflation led the Federal Reserve to renew a pledge to hold
interest rates near zero, minutes of the policy makers’ last
meeting will show today.  
 “Consumer spending has downshifted a bit,” said  Zach Pandl , an economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. in
New York. “It supports the case for a relatively slow, choppy
recovery. The Fed will certainly take the softer data into
consideration, and any tightening is clearly off the table.”  
 The Commerce Department’s sales figures are due at 8:30
a.m. in Washington. Economists’ estimates ranged from a decline
of 0.8 percent to a 0.5 percent gain.  
 One source of weakness was automobiles. Vehicles sold at an
11.1 million annual pace in June, the slowest in four months,
 industry data  showed. General Motors Co. and  Ford Motor Co. , the
two largest U.S. automakers, reported lower-than-projected
demand.  
 Purchases  excluding automobiles  fell 0.1 percent following
a 1.1 percent drop in May, according to the survey  median .  
 Debt Crisis  
 Europe’s debt crisis poses a risk to the U.S. recovery as
sliding share prices hurt household wealth and shake consumer
and business confidence. The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  has
fallen 10 percent from its April 23 high. The S&P Supercomposite
Retailing  gauge  is down 18 percent from this year’s peak on
April 26.  
 “Less supportive” financial conditions were cited by Fed
officials on June 23, when they reaffirmed forecasts for a
“moderate” pace of growth and kept interest rates unchanged.
At 2 p.m., policy makers will release minutes of the meeting
along with their updated economic projections.  
 The outlook for household spending also reflects the waning
of government incentives such as rebates to buy energy-efficient
appliances that spurred retail sales earlier this year.  
 Trailing Estimates  
 While an industrywide measure of sales at stores open at
least a year rose in June for the 10th consecutive month,
results trailed analysts’ estimates. Sales at 30 chains rose 3.1
percent after a 2.7 percent gain in May, Retail Metrics Inc.
said on July 8. Analysts estimated a 3.5 percent increase.  
 Minneapolis-based Target, the second-largest U.S. discount
retailer, reported a gain that included strong demand for food
and clothing and “particularly soft” purchases of electronics
and music.  
 Teen clothing chain  American Eagle Outfitters Inc.  posted a
drop from a year earlier compared with forecasts for an
increase, and said weak sales necessitated deeper promotions.
Same-store sales were unchanged at Gap, the San Francisco-based
owner of Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores.  
 “June was a difficult month with lighter traffic than we
anticipated,” Gap’s Chief Financial Officer  Sabrina Simmons 
said in a July 8 statement.  
 Department stores fared better last month as price cuts and
record-high temperatures on the East Coast pushed more shoppers
into air-conditioned malls.  Nordstrom Inc. , J.C. Penney Co. and
Macy’s Inc. topped analysts’ average estimates.  
 Trimming Forecasts  
 Economists trimmed projections for consumer spending this
year to an average of 2.4 percent from 2.5 percent a month ago,
according to this month’s Bloomberg survey taken July 1 to July
8. They also marked down the 2010 growth estimate and said the
jobless rate, which reached a 26-year high of 10.1 percent in
October 2009, will average 9.6 percent this year.  
 The  cost  of imported products fell 0.4 percent in June
after decreasing 0.6 percent the prior month, an 8:30 a.m.
report from the Labor Department will show, according to the
survey median.  
 A Commerce Department report at 10 a.m. will show business
 inventories  expanded 0.2 percent in May after rising 0.4 percent
the prior month, the survey showed.
