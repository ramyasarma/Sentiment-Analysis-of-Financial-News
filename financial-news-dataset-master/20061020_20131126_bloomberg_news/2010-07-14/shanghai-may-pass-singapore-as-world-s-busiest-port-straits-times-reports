             Shanghai may overtake Singapore to
become the world’s busiest container port this year, helped by a
strong rebound in global trade, the Straits Times said.  
 Shanghai handled more containers between April and June,
the report said, citing data compiled by port authorities. In
the first six months of this year, Singapore moved 14.05 million
20-foot standard containers and Shanghai 13.85 million, it said.
