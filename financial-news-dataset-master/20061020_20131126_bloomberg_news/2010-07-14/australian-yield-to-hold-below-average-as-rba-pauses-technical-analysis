             Australian two-year  yields  will
probably stay below their 200-day average as traders bet the
central bank will extend a pause in interest-rate increases,
according to National Australia Bank Ltd.  
 The two-year note yielded 4.48 percent as of 11:22 a.m. in
Sydney, versus the 200-day average of 4.59 percent. The rate
fell below the barrier in June as a debt crisis in Europe led
traders to cut bets that the Reserve Bank of Australia would
increase  borrowing costs .  
 “Given the global fragility in markets, that will prove
quite a strong resistance point,” said  Peter Jolly , the Sydney-
based head of market research for the investment-banking unit at
National Australia, the nation’s largest bank by assets. “To
break above that, the market is going to have to anticipate more
Reserve Bank rate hikes.”  
 The yield was above the 200-day average in March, April and
May as traders correctly bet on central bank  rate  increases. The
Reserve Bank boosted its target for overnight bank lending by a
quarter percentage point in each of those three months, bringing
it to 4.5 percent.  
 Reserve Bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  kept the rate unchanged
at the June and July meetings amid concern European government
efforts to cut spending would curb global economic growth.  
 For bond yields, a resistance level is one where orders to
buy may be clustered.
