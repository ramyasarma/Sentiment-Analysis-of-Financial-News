             Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  fell as concern increased that an economic recovery may
stall after reports showed U.S. retail sales declined and the
Federal Reserve cut its growth forecast.  
 American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. , a
carmaker that counts North America as its biggest market,
retreated 0.8 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo.
Those of Canon Inc., which is the world’s largest maker of
cameras and gets about 80 percent of its revenue outside Japan,
lost 1.1 percent as the yen strengthened. ADRs of BHP Billiton,
the world’s biggest mining company, lost 0.9 percent from the
Sydney close as copper prices declined.  
 “It’s hard to eliminate concerns about the future,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in assets in
Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “However, shares
have significant upside potential in terms of valuations.”  
 Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,780 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,790 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,780 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index sank 0.4 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index slid 0.3 percent in Wellington.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. In New York yesterday, the index slipped less than 0.1
percent as the decline in retail sales and the Federal Reserve’s
assessment that the economic outlook has “softened”
overshadowed Intel Corp.’s forecast for record profit.  
 U.S. Retail Sales  
 Sales at U.S. retailers dropped 0.5 percent in June, more
than projected, after declining 1.1 percent in May, Commerce
Department figures showed yesterday in Washington.  
 “The economic outlook had softened somewhat and a number
of members saw the risks to the outlook as having shifted to the
downside,” according to minutes released yesterday of a June
meeting of Federal Reserve officials. U.S. central bankers
lowered their central tendency forecast for 2010 growth to a
range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent versus 3.2 percent to 3.7
percent in April, the minutes showed.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has dropped 2.3 percent in 2010,
compared with a 1.8 percent decline for the  S&P 500  and a 0.8
percent gain by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.3 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 13.4 times for the S&P 500 and 11.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  
 The yen appreciated to as much as 88.24 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 88.92 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 112.42 from 112.99. A stronger yen reduces
income at Japanese companies when overseas revenue is converted
into their home currency.  
 Copper futures for September delivery lost 0.3 percent
yesterday in New York.  
 The Chinese government is scheduled to announce figures for
second-quarter gross domestic product and its June consumer
price index this morning.
