             Poland’s sale of five-year bonds
attracted the lowest investor demand in 10 months after an
unexpected acceleration of inflation fueled speculation the
central bank will increase borrowing costs.  
 The government sold 2.03 billion zloty ($635 million) of
the fixed-coupon security due in April 2015, according to the
Finance Ministry’s Bloomberg page. Bids totaled 2.81 billion
zloty, compared with 1.5 billion to 3 billion zloty offered by
the ministry. That was the lowest auction demand for Polish
five-year debt since the Sept. 9 offering of April 2014 paper.  
 The consumer price index rose 2.3 percent in June from the
same month a year earlier, compared with a 2.2 percent inflation
rate in May, the statistics office in Warsaw said yesterday. The
median forecast of economists and a July 1 estimate by the
Finance Ministry were both for inflation to slow to 2.1 percent.  
 “The higher-than-expected June CPI released yesterday is
likely to intensify rate-hike speculations, which could dampen
interest in Polish bonds for now,” Societe Generale SA analyst
 Esther Law  in London wrote in a report before today’s auction.  
 The average yield at today’s auction rose to 5.37 percent
from 5.14 percent on May 12, according to the ministry. The
five-year bonds dropped after the auction, sending the yield up
five basis points to 5.41 percent as of 1:42 p.m. in Warsaw.
