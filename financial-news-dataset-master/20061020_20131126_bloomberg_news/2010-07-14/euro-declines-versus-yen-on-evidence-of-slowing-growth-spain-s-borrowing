             The yen advanced against most of its
major counterparts as Federal Reserve minutes indicated
increased risk to the economic recovery, discouraging investors
from buying higher-yielding assets.  
 The dollar pared its loss versus the euro on revived demand
for safety as the minutes of the central bank’s June 23 meeting
showed central bankers were concerned about lingering high
unemployment and risks that inflation may decelerate further.  
 “It’s a risk-aversion trade that’s pushed up the yen,”
said  Sacha Tihanyi , a currency strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia
in Toronto. “The Fed is a little more cautious in their growth
and inflation outlook.”  
 The yen appreciated 0.4 percent to 112.48 versus the euro
at 4:07 p.m. in New York, from 112.90 yesterday. The euro traded
at $1.2740, compared with $1.2724, after touching $1.2778, the
highest level since May 11. The dollar slid 0.5 percent to 88.29
yen, from 88.74.  
 Brazil’s real dropped 0.8 percent to 50.09 yen and Mexico’s
peso slid 0.8 percent to 6.95 yen on speculation the Fed’s
minutes led investors to reduce trades in which they borrow
where interest rates are low to buy higher-yielding assets
elsewhere. Japan’s target lending rate of 0.1 percent makes the
yen popular for funding such transactions.  
 “The economic outlook had softened somewhat and a number
of members saw the risks to the outlook as having shifted to the
downside,” the minutes released today said. “The changes to the
outlook were viewed as relatively modest and as not warranting
policy accommodation beyond that already in place.”  
 Fed’s Stance  
 If the economic outlook worsened, policy makers would need
to consider whether additional stimulus was appropriate,
according to the minutes.  
 U.S.  retail sales  decreased 0.5 percent in June after
falling a revised 1.1 percent in the previous month, the
Commerce Department reported today in Washington. The median
forecast of 75 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
0.3 percent drop.  
 “This reinforces some of the sentiment in the market with
regards to the weak data coming out of the U.S.,” said  Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at Barclays Plc in New York.
“It increases the perception that this might be the beginning
of a slowdown.”  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  ended the day little
changed after a six-day rally.  
 The euro fell earlier versus the yen as a report from the
Bank of Spain showed the nation’s lenders borrowed a record
126.3 billion euros ($161 billion) from the European Central
Bank in June, up 48 percent from 85.6 billion euros in the
previous month. That compares with a drop of 4 percent to 496.6
billion euros that the ECB provided lenders in the euro area.  
 Fitch on Spain  
 Fitch Ratings has a stable outlook on Spain, a spokesman
for the company said in a telephone interview today.  
 “There was a rumor in the morning that Spain might be
downgraded by a ratings company, but that was denied,” said
 Hidetoshi Yanagihara , a senior currency trader at Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. in New York.  
 The pound touched a two-month high versus the dollar as the
U.K.’s unemployment fell and the number of jobless benefit
claimants dropped to the lowest in a year.  
 The number of unemployed was 2.47 million in the quarter
through May, declining for the first time since January, the
Office for National Statistics said. The number of people
claiming benefits in June fell by 20,800, compared with the
median forecast of 20,000.  
 Stronger Pound  
 Sterling rallied 0.5 percent to $1.5254, from $1.5178,
after touching $1.5297, the highest level since May 3. The pound
appreciated 0.4 percent to 83.49 pence per euro.  
 Most major Asian currencies rose versus the dollar after a
report showed Singapore’s economy accelerated to a record 18.1
percent pace in the first half, adding to signs the region is
shrugging off the European sovereign-debt crisis.  
 The growth “should reinforce the view that fears from the
euro zone crisis may be exaggerated,”  Philip Wee , senior
currency economist in Singapore at DBS Group Holdings Ltd.,
wrote in a research note. “Sentiment should remain
constructive, not only for the Singapore dollar, but also other
Asia ex-Japan currencies and commodity currencies.”  
 South Korea’s won jumped 0.8 percent to 1,202.33 against
the greenback. Singapore’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to S$1.3740
after touching S$1.3727, the strongest level in three weeks.
