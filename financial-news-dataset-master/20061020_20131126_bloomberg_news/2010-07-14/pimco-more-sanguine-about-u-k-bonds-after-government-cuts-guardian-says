             Pacific Investment Management Co.,
the world’s biggest bond investor, is more optimistic about
investing in U.K. government bonds after the budget cuts
announced by the government, the Guardian reported, without
saying where it got the information.  
 Pimco, which has $1 trillion of assets under management,
also takes the view that the eurozone’s debt troubles make U.K.
gilts relatively more attractive, the newspaper said.  
 In January, it warned that gilts were “on a bed of
nitroglycerine,” the Guardian said.  
 On July 12, Standard & Poor’s maintained its
negative outlook on Britain’s top credit rating, saying its
projections for the economy are less optimistic than those in
last month’s emergency budget.
