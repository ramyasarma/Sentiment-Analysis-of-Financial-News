             Fiat SpA  may shift auto brand Chief
Executive Officer  Lorenzo Sistino  to its industrial unit as part
of a plan to spin the business off from carmaking, Il Sole 24
Ore reported, without saying how it got the information.  
 Turin-based Fiat may appoint Sistino as head of either
truckmaker Iveco SpA or agricultural equipment producer Case New
Holland, Sole said. Fiat may hire a new chief for its auto brand
from outside the company, the newspaper said.
