             Russia’s parliament passed a law
that bans anyone convicted of a crime from becoming a police
officer, RIA Novosti reported.  
 Ex-cons already serving in the police will be dismissed,
the state-run news service reported today. Lawmakers also
approved imposing harsher sentences for police officers who are
convicted of crimes than for civilians, RIA said.  
 President Dmitry Medvedev must sign the bill for it to
become law.
