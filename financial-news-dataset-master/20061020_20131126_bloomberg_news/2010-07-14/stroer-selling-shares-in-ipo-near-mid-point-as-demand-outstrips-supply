             Stroer Out-of-Home Media AG , the
Cologne, Germany-based outdoor advertising company, priced its
initial public offering at 20 euros a share, near the mid-point
of its original range.  
 The offer “was oversubscribed several times” and the
volume including an over-allotment option totals about 393.9
million euros ($501 million), the company said in a statement
today. Stroer will receive proceeds of 275 million euros, before
the deduction of IPO expenses, it said. Full exercise of the
over-allotment option would provide the company with an
additional 35.8 million euros of capital.  
 The price range for the shares, which will start trading in
Frankfurt tomorrow, had been narrowed to 20 euros to 20.50 euros
apiece from 17 euros to 24 euros originally, terms of the sale
showed yesterday.  
 The number of new shares to be issued was dependent upon
the price fixed for each share, to ensure that Stroer received
275 million euros in proceeds. At the IPO price of 20 euros,
13.75 million shares will be issued, according to the statement.  
 Stroer, which has more than 1,400 employees, intends to use
the proceeds to repay debt and fund expansion, Chief Financial
Officer  Alfried Buehrdel  said on July 5. After IPO costs of
approximately 36.8 million euros, 151 million euros will be used
to settle debts and at least 81 million euros will go toward
acquisitions in Poland and Turkey. An additional unspecified
amount will be invested in new digital billboards.
