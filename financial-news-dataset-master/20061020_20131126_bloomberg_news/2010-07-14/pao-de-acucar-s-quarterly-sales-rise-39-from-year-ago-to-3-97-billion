             Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar , Brazil’s biggest retailer, rose to the
highest price in five months in Sao Paulo trading after saying
second-quarter sales rose 39 percent from a year earlier.  
 Net sales increased to 7 billion reais ($3.97 billion), the
Sao Paulo-based company said in a regulatory filing today. Sales
excluding its Ponto Frio stores rose 13 percent, while those at
stores open more than a year climbed 11 percent.  
 The numbers “confirm the positive trend of a strong
recovery,”  Juliana Campos , an analyst at Ativa Corretora in Rio
de Janeiro, wrote in a note to clients. The brokerage is
reviewing its “neutral” recommendation on the stock, Campos
wrote.  
 Shares gained 1.7 percent to 64.50 reais, the highest price
since Feb. 19. Lojas Americanas SA, Brazil’s biggest discount
retailer, increased 2.5 percent to 13.30 reais while Lojas
Renner SA, the country’s largest publicly traded clothing
retailer, advanced 4.5 percent to 51.40 reais.
