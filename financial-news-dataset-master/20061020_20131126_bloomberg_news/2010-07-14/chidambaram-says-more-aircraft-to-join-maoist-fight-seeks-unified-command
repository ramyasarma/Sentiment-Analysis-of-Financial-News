             India will provide more helicopters
to aid police forces battling Maoist guerrillas, Home Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram told a security meeting of chief
ministers from rebel-hit states in New Delhi today.  
 The aircraft will be used to supply forces and move
security personnel, Chidambaram told the meeting, according to a
statement issued by the government. The Home Ministry will also
strengthen police posts and ask the administrations of four
states to create a unified command to take on the rebels, the
statement quoted Chidambaram as saying.
