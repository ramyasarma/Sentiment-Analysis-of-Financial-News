             U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
pressed Facebook Inc., the world’s most popular social-
networking service, to remove a page on which users can post
tributes to dead murderer Raoul Moat.  
 Moat murdered his former girlfriend in northeast England
and seriously injured a policeman before shooting himself on
July 11 after eluding police who were hunting him for about a
week. Facebook today featured a page entitled “R.I.P. Raoul
Moat You Legend!” with around 30,000 followers.  
 “It is absolutely clear that Raoul Moat was a callous
murderer, full stop, end of story,” Cameron told lawmakers
during his weekly question-and-answer session in Parliament in
London today. “I cannot understand any wave, however small, of
public sympathy for this man.”  
 Cameron’s spokesman  Steve Field  later told reporters that a
government official would ensure that Facebook was made aware of
the prime minister’s view.
