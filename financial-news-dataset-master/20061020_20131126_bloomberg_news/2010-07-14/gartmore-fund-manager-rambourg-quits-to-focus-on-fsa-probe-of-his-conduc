             Guillaume Rambourg,  who was
suspended by the U.K. fund manager  Gartmore Group Ltd.  in an
internal probe after allegations he broke internal policy, has
announced his resignation from the company.  
 Rambourg said he is leaving the firm after 14 years to
focus on the investigation by the Financial Services Authority
into his conduct, the London-based fund manager said in a
statement today.  
 “I have been faced with a challenging set of circumstances
which has resulted in me not being able to optimally fulfil my
duties in the best interests of shareholders and investors,”
Rambourg said in the statement. “I have, therefore, concluded
that in the short term at least it is in nobody’s interests to
continue in my current reduced capacity.”  
 Gartmore  shares fell 31 percent on March 30 after the firm
said it was investigating fund manager Rambourg for breaking
internal rules by directing orders to buy or sell stock from
favored brokers. Rambourg, who previously helped run the firm’s
two biggest hedge funds with  Roger Guy , returned to work at
Gartmore as an investment analyst in April.  
 The FSA said last month that it is conducting its own
investigation into the actions of Rambourg after he was
reinstated by Gartmore.
