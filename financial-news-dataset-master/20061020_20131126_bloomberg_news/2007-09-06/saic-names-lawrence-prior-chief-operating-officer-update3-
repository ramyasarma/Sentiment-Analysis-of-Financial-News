             SAIC Inc., the defense contractor
that first sold shares to the public in October, promoted
Lawrence B. Prior III to chief operating officer to fill a
position left vacant more than a year.  
 Prior, 51, had been president of the intelligence, security
and technology group and will take the new post on Oct. 1, San
Diego-based SAIC said today in a statement. The position has
been vacant since Duane Andrews retired in February 2006, said
Connie Custer, an SAIC spokeswoman.  
 The intelligence group has more than 11,000 employees of
SAIC's total of more than 44,000. It is the largest unit at the
company, and one of the biggest contractors to U.S. intelligence
agencies. Prior had a leadership role in the company's initial
public offering, as well as in SAIC's acquisitions, the
statement said.  
 SAIC rose 13 cents to $17.86 at 4:02 p.m. in  New York  Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained less than one
percent so far this year.
