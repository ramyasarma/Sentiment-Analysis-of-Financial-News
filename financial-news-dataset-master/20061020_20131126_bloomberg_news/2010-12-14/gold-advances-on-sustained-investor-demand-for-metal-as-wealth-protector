Gold gained for a second day in
New York as a weaker dollar boosted demand for the precious
metal as an alternative investment.  The dollar fell to a three-week low against the euro on
speculation the Federal Reserve may signal today it’s open to
increasing debt purchases beyond the $600 billion already
announced. Gold, which usually moves inversely to the greenback,
reached a record $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7.  “The U.S. dollar weakness is driving gold,”  Peter Fertig ,
owner of Quantitative Commodity Research Ltd. in Hainburg,
Germany, said today by phone. “There’s still an argument for
further implementation of quantitative easing in the U.S. That
would benefit gold.”  Gold for delivery in February rose 50 cents to $1,398.50 an
ounce by 8:43 a.m. on the Comex in New York.  Gold will average $1,550 next year, up from a previous
forecast of $1,400, UBS AG analyst  Julien Garran  said in a
report yesterday. Platinum and palladium are also among the
bank’s top picks for next year, Garran said.  Gold gained 28 percent this year, set for a 10th annual
gain, as investors lost confidence in currencies and bought
precious metals as a protection of wealth. Further government
bond purchases by the Fed are “certainly possible,” Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said in an interview broadcast on  CBS  Corp.’s
“60 Minutes” on Dec. 5.  ‘Safety Drive’  “We expect European debt concerns, continuing implications
of quantitative easing and an ongoing safety drive to fuel
investor demand,” UBS’s Garran said. “Absolute faith in fiat
currencies remains shaky. Gold is currently behaving as a
currency rather than a commodity.”  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products rose 2.98 metric
tons to 2,096.39 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14. Silver holdings gained 51.02 tons to 15,090.16
tons, the highest amount since at least February, data from four
providers show.  Platinum for January delivery gained $7.70, or 0.5 percent,
to $1,705 an ounce and palladium for March delivery added $5.55,
or 0.7 percent, to $758 an ounce. Silver for March delivery fell
10.9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $29.515 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
