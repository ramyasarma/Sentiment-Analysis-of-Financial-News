Corn dropped as investors locked-in
gains after prices climbed to a one-month high yesterday on
optimism that demand for commodities may grow as China refrained
from raising interest rates. Wheat also declined.  Corn for March delivery dropped as much as 0.7 percent to
$5.845 a bushel in Chicago before trading at $5.8775 at 3.09
p.m. Singapore time. The most-active contract surged as much as
2.6 percent yesterday to $5.89, the highest level since Nov. 10.
Wheat for March delivery lost 0.6 percent to $7.755 a bushel.  “Profit-taking activities” after sharp gains yesterday
may be driving prices lower, said  Ker Chung Yang , an analyst at
Singapore-based Phillip Futures Pte.  “The market was retreating on a firmer tone in the dollar
and cautious trading after a rally yesterday,” Han Sung Min, a
broker at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul, said today.  The  Dollar Index , which tracks the currencies of six major
U.S. trading partners, gained as much as 0.2 percent after
falling as much as 1.2 percent yesterday to a one-week low on
speculation that the Federal Reserve will buy Treasuries beyond
the $600 billion already announced.  “We see a lot of ups and downs in the market today, which
are not related to fundamentals at all,”  Wayne Gordon , a senior
analyst at Rabobank Groep NV, said by phone from Sydney. “It’s
more related to financial-market issues.”  Soybeans for January delivery gained 0.2 percent to $13.15
a bushel after falling as much as 0.5 percent. The most-active
contract advanced 3.2 percent yesterday, the biggest gain since
Dec. 1.  Large areas of Argentina are likely to get very dry weather
in the near term, supporting soybean prices, Ker said.  Corn futures, set for the biggest annual advance in four
years, may extend gains to end the year strongly, according to
Barclays Capital.  “Commodity markets in general, with perhaps the exception
of natural gas, look set to see out the year on a strong note,
and this is no less the case for the agricultural sector,”
according to a report dated yesterday by analysts including
 Philip Roberts . “Corn, in particular, has been strong, and we
expect the 5 1/2-month trendline support in the $5.40 area to
keep any downside move in check.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
