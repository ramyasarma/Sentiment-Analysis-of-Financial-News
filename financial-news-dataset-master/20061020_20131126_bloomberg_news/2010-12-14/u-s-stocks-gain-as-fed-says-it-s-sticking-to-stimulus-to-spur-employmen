U.S. stocks maintained gains after
the Federal Reserve said its plan to purchase $600 billion in
Treasuries by June remains unchanged because the economic
recovery is insufficient to bring down unemployment.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.4 percent to
1,245.43, its highest level on a closing basis since Sept. 19,
2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 65.39 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 11,493.95.  The S&P 500 has risen about 19 percent since Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke indicated on Aug. 27 that he was considering
pumping more cash into financial markets through bond purchases.
The Fed announced after its November meeting that it would buy
$600 billion in Treasuries.  Today’s advance for the S&P 500 sent the index close to
1,251.7, its last closing level before the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., which worsened the financial crisis and
preceded a 46 percent plunge in the index through March 2009.  Fed officials were projected to make no change to their
stimulus package at today’s meeting, according to 38 of 39
analysts in a Bloomberg survey Dec. 7-8. Bernanke may find his
options for reducing unemployment near a 26-year high
constrained after Republicans take control of the House of
Representatives next month.  Stock futures gained in premarket trading after Commerce
Department figures showed that purchases at U.S. retailers
increased 0.8 percent, following a 1.7 percent gain in October.
The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for a 0.6 percent rise.  Separately, the Labor Department said that the producer
price index increased 0.8 percent from the prior month after a
0.4 percent rise. Excluding more volatile food and energy costs,
it was smallest year-over-year gain in five months at 1.2
percent.  U.S. equities extended gains after the Commerce Department
said inventories in the U.S. rose less than forecast in October,
restrained by the biggest drop in retail stockpiles in more than
a year as merchants had trouble keeping up with surging demand.
The 0.7 percent increase in inventories compared with a 1.4
percent jump in sales in October that was the biggest gain in
seven months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
