New Jersey  collected 3.8 percent
more revenue in the first five months of the fiscal year than
projected in its budget as income taxes ran almost 13 percent
above estimates, the state treasurer said.  The “welcome development” may help New Jersey avoid mid-
year budget cuts, Treasurer  Andrew Sidamom-Eristoff  said in a
statement today.  Revenue for the July-through-November period totaled $9.82
billion, exceeding the $9.46 billion the state anticipated
collecting, he said. Income-tax collections, the state’s biggest
source of revenue, were $3.43 billion, compared with a forecast
of $3.04 billion.  He said the higher collections may be due to residents
moving up income-tax payments to avoid potential higher federal
rates in January, or because of early year-end company bonuses.  “The good news is that we are right on target for the
first five months of 2010, but collections during the first four
months of calendar 2011 will determine whether the faster growth
we’re seeing in New Jersey incomes is real and can be
sustained,” Sidamon-Eristoff said.  Sales taxes, the second-largest source of revenue, trailed
estimates by 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
