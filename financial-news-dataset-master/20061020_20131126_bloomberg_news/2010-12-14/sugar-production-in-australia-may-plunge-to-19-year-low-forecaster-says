Sugar production in Australia, the
third-largest exporter, may plunge to the lowest in almost two
decades as wet weather forces producers to leave some cane
unharvested this season.  Output may drop 21 percent to 3.58 million metric tons, the
Australian Bureau of Agricultural & Resource Economics &
Sciences, or Abares, said in an e-mailed  report  today. That
would be the lowest level since the 1991-1992 season.  Raw sugar prices in New York gained to a 29-year high this
year on concern that production would be lower than expected in
Brazil, the largest exporter, and India.  Queensland Sugar Ltd. ,
Australia’s biggest shipper, cut its export outlook this month
because of above-average rainfall.  “This has reduced the area harvested and lowered the sugar
content of cane,” the Canberra-based forecasting bureau said.
The production forecast today assumed that about 3 million tons
of cane intended for harvest would remain in the field, it said.
Abares in September estimated a harvest of 4.55 million tons,
compared with production last season of 4.52 million tons.  Raw sugar futures rose 4.7 percent to 30.49 cents a pound
on ICE Futures U.S. in New York yesterday on signs that heavy
rains may limit supplies from India, the second-biggest grower.
The price reached 33.39 cents on Nov. 11, the highest level
since 1981.  Australia’s commodity forecaster cut its export outlook to
2.4 million tons, from 3.2 million tons in September, and
shipments in the year ended June 30 of 3.2 million tons.  Queensland Sugar , which handles more than 90 percent of
Australia’s exports, on Dec. 6 reduced its shipment forecast to
2.2 million tons, from 2.9 million to 3 million tons earlier
this year.  Global sugar demand will exceed supply in the marketing
year that ends Sept. 30, ABN Amro Bank NV and VM Group said last
week, reversing an earlier forecast for a surplus.  Demand will reach 165.3 million tons, almost 3 million tons
more than supply, ABN Amro and VM Group said in a report Dec.
10. The biggest deficit will be in Asia, with a 13.9 million-ton
shortage. The previous global forecast was for a surplus of 1.2
million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
