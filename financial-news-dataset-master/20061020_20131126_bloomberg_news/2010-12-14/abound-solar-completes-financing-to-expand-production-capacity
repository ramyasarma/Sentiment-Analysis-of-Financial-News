Abound Solar Inc. , a closely held
maker of thin-film solar modules, raised $110 million from
investors and closed on a $400 million government loan guarantee
to increase its production capacity.  The funding round included existing investors, led by Invus
Group, and two new backers,  BP Plc ’s  alternative energy  unit and
West Hill Investors, the Loveland, Colorado-based company said
today in a statement.  “We’re beginning the process of scaling up and becoming a
major manufacturer,” Chief Executive Officer  Tom Tiller , 49,
said in an interview. “We’re really pleased that all of our
existing shareholders took part and that we were also able to
attract two new ones.”  A quarter of the $400 million loan guarantee from the
Department of Energy will help Abound double annual production
at its Longmont, Colorado, plant to 200 megawatts by 2012. The
rest will be used to complete by 2014 what may become the
largest U.S. module factory, with 640 megawatts, in Tipton,
Indiana, the company said. The DOE guarantee was awarded in
July.  U.S. solar manufacturers exported $723 million worth of
panels and equipment last year, and domestic sales reached $2.6
billion, the Solar Energy Industry Association said today in a
 report .  Tiller said about 90 percent of Abound’s sales are in
Europe, and most of the production from the expanded factories
will be exported to the European region.  Abound employs about 450 workers now and plans to hire
1,200 more workers over the next three years, Tiller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
