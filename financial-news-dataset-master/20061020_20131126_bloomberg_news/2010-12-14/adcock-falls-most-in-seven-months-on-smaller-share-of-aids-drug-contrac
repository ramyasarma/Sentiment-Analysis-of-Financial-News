Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd. ,
Africa’s largest over-the-counter drug company, fell the most in
a year after a rival got a bigger portion of a 4.16 billion-rand
($610 million)  contract to supply AIDS treatments .  Adcock declined as much as 4.25 rand, or 6.9 percent, to
57.42 rand, the biggest intraday drop since Dec. 9, 2009. The
stock was down 4.4 percent at 58.99 rand at the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg.  Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd.  gained as much as
2.9 percent after saying it won about 40 percent of the tender.  Adcock’s share of the South African tender fell to 4
percent, or 116.9 million rand, compared with 21 percent of the
3.17 billion-rand contract awarded in 2008, the Midrand-based
company said in a statement today.  Cipla Medpro South Africa
Ltd. , the third-biggest drugmaker, won about 15 percent, or 633
million rand of the new contract, it said.  It’s “good news for Aspen at the expense of Adcock,”
 Sasha Naryshkine , an investment manager at Vestact in
Johannesburg, said in an interview today. “The business comes
with a low margin, but at least it keeps the factory going.”  South Africa has more people living with the AIDS-causing
virus than any other country, with one in six between the ages
of 15 and 49 infected, according to the Geneva-based Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.  The tender runs from Jan. 1 through December 2012 and its
value to the company is 3.6 billion rand, Aspen, the largest
maker of generic medicines in the Southern Hemisphere, said.  Aspen  gained 2 rand, or 2.2 percent, to 94.50 rand, while
Cipla Medpro, once a takeover target for Adcock, gained 19
cents, or 2.7 percent, to 7.18 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
