Poland plans to narrow its budget
deficit by about 1 percentage point of gross domestic product
each year, with the aim of exiting the European Union’s
excessive deficit procedure in 2012, Finance Minister Jacek
Rostowski was quoted as saying in an interview published today
by Dziennik Gazeta Prawna.  Rostowski said the European Commission’s offer to take
pension costs into account in determining whether a country had
excessive deficit or debt is “crucial” to Poland, Dziennik
reported. With Poland’s debt to private pension funds included,
“it would be very difficult for us to enter the euro area as
our debt according to the EU’s definition would be above 60
percent of GDP on a sustained basis,” Dziennik quoted Rostowski
as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
