Kenya ’s shilling pared earlier gains
after the central bank bought dollars in the domestic foreign-
exchange market.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.9 percent to 79.85 per dollar, before trading at 80.55
at 13:44 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi. It closed at 80.60 on
Dec. 10. Kenyan financial markets were closed yesterday for a
public holiday.  The  Central Bank of Kenya  announced earlier it planned to
buy $8 million in the domestic market. The bank later said it
purchased an unspecified amount of dollars at 80.5650 each.  “The Central Bank of Kenya offered to buy dollars to
stabilize the market as demand by businesses rose in a bid to
settle their invoices before year-end,” John Muli, a dealer at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
