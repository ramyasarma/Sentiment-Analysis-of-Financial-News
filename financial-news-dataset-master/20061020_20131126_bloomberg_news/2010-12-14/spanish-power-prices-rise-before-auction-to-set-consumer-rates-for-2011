Wholesale power prices in Spain rose
this month ahead of an auction that’s used to set the rate
consumers will pay for electricity in the next three months.  Spanish power for first-quarter delivery has averaged about
49.75 euros ($67) a megawatt-hour in December compared with
44.40 euros in November, according to broker prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The surge leaves the benchmark price above the 46.90
euro level on Sept. 21 when the previous auction was held.  The increase of recent days signals utilities such as
Endesa SA and Iberdrola SA may be able to charge consumers a
higher price in the first three months of 2011.  Homes pay a fixed tariff set each quarter on the basis of
the power auction plus an additional charge for use of the grid
that is determined by the government.  The government has set the grid charge below the cost of
delivering power every year since 2005, racking up debts of 14.6
billion euros that consumers must repay to power companies from
future bills.  Spanish regulators are concerned that price increases ahead
of quarterly power auctions boost costs for consumers while
utilities benefit from declining prices following the sale to
increase their profit margins, Cinco Dias newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
