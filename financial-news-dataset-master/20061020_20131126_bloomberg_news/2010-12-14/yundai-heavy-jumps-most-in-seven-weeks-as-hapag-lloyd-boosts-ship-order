Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. , the
world’s largest shipbuilder, jumped the most in more than 11
months in Seoul trading after Hapag-Lloyd AG increased a
container-ship order by about $754 million.  The shipping line expanded the capacity of six on-order
ships to 13,200 boxes each and ordered four additional vessels
of the same size, it said in a  statement  on its website
yesterday. The move boosted the order value to $1.45 billion
from 793.9 billion won ($696 million), Hyundai Heavy said today.  STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co.  also rose after the company
and an affiliate won a $912 million ship order from another STX
Group company. Demand for new vessels has rebounded this year as
trade recovers from the global recession and as shipping lines
prepare for the completion of work to widen the Panama Canal.  “The order news helped lift shares of shipbuilders
today,” said  Song Jae Hak , a Seoul-based analyst at Woori
Investment & Securities Co. “The recent rise in vessel orders
and prices, as well as increasing orders in non-traditional
shipyard areas like power plants, have brightened the outlook
for shipbuilders next year.”  Hyundai Heavy, based in Ulsan, South Korea, rose 8.9
percent, the most since Jan. 7, to close at 417,000 won. That’s
the highest closing since January 2008. The benchmark Kospi
index rose 0.6 percent.  STX Offshore  jumped 8.3 percent, the most in about a month,
to 23,550 won. The company and its Dalian, China shipyard will
build 20 vessels to carry wood pulp for STX Pan Ocean Co., the
shipbuilder said in an e-mailed statement today.  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. , the world’s
second-biggest shipyard, surged 6.2 percent to close at 32,650
won, the highest since September 2008.  Hapag-Lloyd will use its 10 vessels, due for delivery from
mid-2012 to the end of 2013, on Far East routes, it said in its
statement. Work to widen the Panama Canal, which will allow
larger vessels to use the waterway, is due to be completed in
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
