The pound traded near the highest
level in three weeks against the dollar as a report showed U.K.
inflation remained above the government’s 3 percent limit last
month.  Consumer prices rose 3.3 percent from a year earlier after
a 3.2 percent increase in October, the Office for National
Statistics said today in London. That’s the highest since May
and exceeded the 3.2 percent median forecast of 33 economists in
a Bloomberg survey. Sterling advanced above $1.59 for the first
time since Nov. 23. The U.K.  housing-market gauge  stayed close
to the lowest in 18 months in November. Government bonds were
little changed before tomorrow’s sale of debt due 2016.  “Inflation expectations are bolstering sterling,” said
 Jane Foley , a senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “There seems little scope for any
moderation in inflation, given there’s an increase in sales tax
next month. This suggests the chances of further quantitative
easing by the Bank of England are extremely slim.”  The pound was at $1.5870 as of 12:18 p.m. in London, from
$1.5862 in New York yesterday. It reached $1.5911 earlier.
Sterling depreciated 0.5 percent to 84.83 pence per euro.  “There’s been an element of profit-taking into the year-
end as investors sell their dollars,”  Simon Smollett , a
currency analyst at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank
in London, said in a telephone interview.  Inflation  Inflation has been above the government’s 3 percent limit
for nine months and a sales-tax increase in January may add to
prices in 2011. Bank of England Deputy Governor  Charles Bean 
said yesterday the strength of inflation has increased the risk
to price expectations and there may also be less slack in the
economy than previously thought.  Bank of England policy makers last week held their asset-
purchase program unchanged at 200 billion pounds ($318 billion).
Governor  Mervyn King  has said that consumer-price gains will
stay “elevated” next year. Inflation has been stoked by higher
costs of imports, partly reflecting the weakness of the pound.  The number of real-estate agents and surveyors saying
prices fell exceeded those reporting gains by 44 percentage
points, compared with minus 49 points in October, the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors said today.  Sterling has lost 0.6 percent in the past week, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, which track
a basket of 10 developed-country currencies.  Since the end of 2009, Britain’s currency has lost 4.5
percent, compared with a 9 percent decline by the euro and a 2.5
percent loss by the dollar.  Government Bonds  U.K. government bonds pared earlier gains, with the 10-year
gilt yield holding at 3.55 percent. The two-year yield fell one
basis point to 1.15 percent.  The Debt Management Office plans to sell 3.5 billion pounds
of securities maturing in January 2016 tomorrow and 825 million
pounds of inflation-protected securities due 2042 on Dec. 16.  Gilt futures may drop as low as 116.94, should the price of
the March 2011 contract close below a so-called support level at
117.93, UBS AG said, citing trading patterns.  A closing break below 117.93, the low from Dec. 8, “will
signal further downside to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement
level at 116.94, which we have set as our next target point,”
 Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy at UBS
in London, wrote in an e-mailed report.  The gilt futures contract expiring in March rose less than
0.1 percent to 118.00, after declining to 117.78 earlier.  Gilts returned 5.6 percent this year, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. Treasuries gained 5.9 percent and
German debt, the euro-area’s benchmark securities, returned 5.8
percent, the EFFAS indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
