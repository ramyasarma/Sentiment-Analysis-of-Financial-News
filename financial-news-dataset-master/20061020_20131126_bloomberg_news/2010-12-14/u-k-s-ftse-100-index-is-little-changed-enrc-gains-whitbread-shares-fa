U.K. stocks  advanced for a fourth
day, sending the FTSE 100 Index to the highest level in 2 1/2
years, as U.S. retail sales exceeded economists’ forecasts.  BP Plc rallied 3.2 percent as the oil company sold fields
in Pakistan to Hong Kong-based investment group United Energy
Group Ltd. Imagination Technologies Group Plc gained 5.7 percent
after the chip designer reported increased earnings. Whitbread
Plc retreated 2.8 percent after saying sales growth slowed at
its Premier Inn brand.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  rose 0.5 percent to 5,891.21 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London, the highest level since June 2008.
The gauge has climbed 1.4 percent so far this week as China
refrained from raising interest rates and economic reports
boosted confidence in the global recovery. The  FTSE All-Share
Index  also gained 0.5 percent today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index 
retreated by the same amount.  “Once again we have seen investors’ ongoing appetite for
risk,” said  Yusuf Heusen , London-based senior sales trader at
IG Index. “U.S. markets have also kept momentum going with
November retail sales rising more than forecast. Any selloffs
are proving to be very short lived.”  Stocks extended gains today after a report showed  sales at
U.S. retailers  rose more than forecast in November, boosting
confidence in the economic recovery. Purchases increased 0.8
percent following a 1.7 percent gain in October that was larger
than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said.  BP, Shell  BP jumped 3.2 percent to 473.1 pence after selling the
Pakistani assets to United Energy for $775 million as part of
its plan to pay for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  Separately, Jefferies rated the oil producer “hold” in
new coverage and set a price estimate of 475 pence. The firm
also initiated coverage of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  with a “buy”
recommendation and a price target of 2,350 pence. The stock rose
1.1 percent to 2,089.5 pence.  Imagination Technologies gained 5.7 percent to 380 pence as
the U.K. chip designer that has Intel Corp. as its largest
shareholder reported a 16 percent increase in first-half sales
to 44.1 million pounds ($70 million) while net income almost
doubled to 11.7 million pounds.  Whitbread dropped 2.8 percent to 1,740 pence as the company
reported slowing sales growth. Revenue at Premier Inn outlets
open at least a year rose 8.7 percent in the third quarter and
9.6 percent for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year. Total
comparable sales for the quarter gained 6.8 percent compared
with 7.5 percent for the 39 weeks.  Lonmin Slips  Lonmin Plc lost 1.1 percent to 1,864 pence as the platinum
producer failed to reach a wage agreement with South Africa’s
National Union of Mineworkers. Should both parties fail to reach
a resolution next week, a certificate of non-resolution may be
issued, paving the way for strike action, the NUM said.  Carpetright Plc  fell 1.8 percent to 782 pence. The U.K.’s
biggest carpet retailer reported a 10 percent decline in fiscal
first-half profit to 7 million pounds as demand in the U.K. and
Ireland declined.  Betfair Group Plc also retreated, tumbling 16 percent to
990 pence. The British Internet-gambling company that sold
shares to the public in October posted a 5.3 percent decline in
