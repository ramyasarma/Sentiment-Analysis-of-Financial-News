A drop in OPEC spare production
capacity will signal a “second stage” in the oil market’s
recovery, lifting crude higher than $100 a barrel by the second
half of 2011, according to  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
supply more oil, reducing its spare capacity, as global
inventory levels “normalize” from an overhang cause by the
recession, the bank said in its 2011 commodities outlook dated
yesterday. The 12-member group, which pumps about 40 percent of
the world’s crude, said at a Dec. 11 meeting it will maintain
production targets at levels agreed in December 2008.  “Inventories have declined rapidly in recent months as
global demand growth has accelerated to one of the highest
levels on record,” Goldman analysts led by London-based  Jeffrey Currie  said in the report. “We expect global demand growth to
remain strong at over 2 million barrels a day.”  Oil has risen 11 percent this year on speculation the
global economic rebound will boost fuel consumption. The
International Energy Agency, in its monthly report Dec. 10,
upgraded its demand forecast for next year, citing gains in
North America and China. Futures for January delivery on the New
York Mercantile Exchange traded at $90.76 a barrel on Dec. 7,
the highest since October 2008, and were above $88 today.  OPEC members with formal output quotas, which excludes
Iraq, produced 26.7 million barrels a day last month, 1.9
million more than targeted, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Nigeria, Iran and Angola exceeded their quotas the
most in volume terms.  “As OPEC spare capacity is drawn down through the second
half of 2011, we expect the market to begin to transition back
to a structural bull market, with WTI crude oil prices rising
back above $100 a barrel,” the analysts wrote.  Price Forecasts  Goldman Sachs, in yesterday’s report, predicted West Texas
Intermediate crude, the benchmark grade traded in New York, will
rise to $89 a barrel within three months, $100 within six months
and $105 within a year. Oil last traded above $100 in October
2008 as commodities and equities fell following the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  The first stage in the oil market’s recovery started with
the decline in inventories, the bank said.  Crude stockpiles  in
the U.S., the largest oil-consuming nation, declined earlier
this month to 355.9 million barrels, according to the Energy
Department. That’s 9.8 percent above the five-year average, down
from more than 13 percent two months ago.  Supplies  probably dropped  2.6 million barrels in the week
ended Dec. 10, based on the median estimate from 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News before the department’s weekly report
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
