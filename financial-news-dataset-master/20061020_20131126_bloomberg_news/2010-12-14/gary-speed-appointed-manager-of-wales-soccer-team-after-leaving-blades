Gary Speed was named manager of the

said on its website.  Speed spent the past four months as manager of Sheffield
United. The 41-year-old fills the void left by the resignation
of John Toshack on Sept. 9.  Speed made 85 appearances for Wales, a record for an
outfielder player. He appeared in 677 games for Leeds, Everton,
Newcastle, Bolton and Sheffield United from 1988-2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
