The New York Jets suspended strength
and conditioning coach Sal Alosi without pay for the rest of the
National Football League season for tripping a Miami player
during yesterday’s loss to the Dolphins.  Alosi was also fined $25,000, the Jets said in an e-mailed
statement, and will miss any playoff contests.  The 33-year-old assistant coach apologized today for the
incident and said he’d accept whatever punishment the Jets or
the league gave him.  “After reviewing the facts and consulting with the league
office, we determined that this was the most appropriate
discipline,” Jets General Manager  Mike Tannenbaum  said in the
statement. “I have spoken with Sal. He understands the severity
of his actions and has apologized to all parties involved in the
incident.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
