U.S. investors added more money to
money-market mutual funds in November than they have in almost
two years as they took out cash from stock and bond funds in a
period of rising interest rates.  Money funds attracted a net $24.7 billion, the most since
January 2009, Chicago-based  Morningstar Inc . said today in a
report. Investors pulled $1.9 billion from stock funds and $1.5
billion from bond funds, led by $7.6 billion in withdrawals from
municipal-bond funds.  “Investors retreated in a big way in November,”  Kevin McDevitt , editorial director at Morningstar, wrote in the
report.  U.S. stock funds had net redemptions of $4 billion in
the month, suggesting investors prefer the safety of money
funds over the risk of owning equities as rising inflation
expectations make bonds less attractive. Tax-exempt bonds had
their worst monthly returns of 2010 in November amid rising U.S.
Treasury yields and record state and local fixed-rate debt
sales. Bond prices fall as yields climb.  Bill Gross ’s  Pimco Total Return Fund , the world’s largest
mutual fund, suffered its first withdrawals in two years.
Investors pulled $1.9 billion from the $250 billion fund last
month, Morningstar data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
