Samsung Electronics Co. , the world’s
largest maker of televisions and flat screens, agreed to buy
shares in two medical-equipment makers as part of the parent
group’s plans to expand into new businesses.  The company will acquire a controlling 43.5 percent of
diagnostic ultrasound device maker  Medison Co.  and 100 percent
of Prosonic Co., a manufacturer of transducer probes and cables,
from Consus Asset Management Co., the Suwon, South Korea-based
electronics maker said in a statement today. Financial terms
weren’t disclosed.  The company said ultrasound diagnostic devices are a
logical entry point because of the similarities and potential
synergies with Samsung’s electronics business and technologies.
Samsung Group said in May it plans to invest 23.3 trillion won
($20 billion) in five new “growth engines,” including healthcare
equipment, by 2020.  Samsung Electronics rose 0.4 percent to 934,000 won at
11:40 a.m. in Seoul trading, compared with the 0.3 percent gain
by the nation’s benchmark Kospi index.  Samsung bought 68 percent of Ray Co., a closely held South
Korean dental-equipment maker, Chenny Kim, a Samsung spokeswoman,
said on Sept. 1.  Samsung will pay at least 300 billion won for the Medison
stake, the Chosun Ilbo said today, citing unidentified industry
officials. Jason Kim, a Samsung spokesman, declined to confirm
or deny the report, citing confidentiality of the contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
