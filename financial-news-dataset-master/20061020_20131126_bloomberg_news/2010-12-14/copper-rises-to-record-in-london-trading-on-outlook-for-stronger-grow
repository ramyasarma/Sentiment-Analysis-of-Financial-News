Copper rose to a record for a second
day in London before a U.S. report that may signal growth in the
world’s biggest economy as the Federal Reserve prepares to
discuss interest rates and bond purchases.  U.S. retail sales in November probably jumped for a fifth
consecutive month, economists said before a Commerce Department
report today. The dollar fell today on speculation the Fed may
signal it’s open to increasing debt purchases to boost growth.  U.S. fiscal stimulus and “improving economic data” are
supporting copper, said David Thurtell, an analyst at Citigroup
Inc. in London.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as $37 to
the all-time high of $9,262 a metric ton, and was at $9,259.75 a
ton at 10:47 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange. Copper for
delivery in March climbed as much as 0.5 percent to $4.227 a
pound on the Comex in New York, the highest price for a most-
active contract since May 2008.  The U.S. retail sales report is due at 1:30 p.m. London
time.  Copper has gained 25 percent this year as declining
stockpiles signaled more demand. German investor confidence
improved for a second month in December as the recovery in
Europe’s largest economy shows signs of broadening.  German Confidence  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict developments six months ahead, increased to 4.3 from
1.8 in November. Economists expected a gain to 3.9, according to
the median of 36 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  LME inventories of copper have shrunk 30 percent this
year, set for the first annual drop since 2004. They rose 450
tons to 350,900 tons today, daily exchange figures showed.  Open interest in the December LME copper contract is 15,347
contracts, each for 25 tons, or 383,675 tons in total.  “The open interest on futures exceeds the total level of
stocks in LME warehouses, so that’s keeping the tightness
sustained,” said Robin Bhar, an analyst at Credit Agricole SA’s
investment-banking unit in London.  The  U.S. currency  declined as much as 0.4 percent against a
basket of currencies. A slumping dollar makes metals priced in
the currency cheaper in terms of other monies and spurs demand
for raw materials as an alternative investment.  Copper’s “probably going to be $5 a pound ($11,023 a ton)
in a year’s time,”  John Stephenson , a fund manager at First
Asset Investment Management Inc., said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. “There’s really no supply coming on ‘till 2012, 2013
in an appreciable way.”  Aurubis Outlook  Aurubis AG, Europe’s largest copper smelter, said copper
demand will grow “further” next year, supported by global
economic growth.  Immediate-delivery LME copper’s premium to three-month
metal rose 63 percent yesterday to $70. Prices moved on Nov. 8
to a so-called backwardation, when nearby metal trades above
longer-term contracts, potentially signaling supply concern.  The fee to borrow copper for next-day delivery, the so-
called tom-next spread, jumped to a premium of $10 today,
compared with a discount of $2 yesterday and the highest since
July 2009. An increase in the fee usually indicates tightening
supply.  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME rose 0.4 percent to
$26,250 a ton. Prices reached a record $27,500 on Nov. 9. The
metal has jumped 55 percent this year, leading advances on the
exchange, after production was disrupted in Indonesia and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Aluminum rose 0.8 percent to $2,350 a ton and nickel
climbed 1.5 percent to $24,890 a ton. Lead gained 0.5 percent to
$2,451 a ton and zinc added 0.9 percent to $2,343.25 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
