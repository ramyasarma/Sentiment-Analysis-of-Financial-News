Pioneer Food Group Ltd. , a South
African food company, said it started reducing the price of
bread and wheat flour as part of a record penalty for anti-
competitive behavior at some of its units.  “The price of standard white and brown loaves of bread was
reduced by an average of 30 cents on Dec. 3,” Pioneer Managing
Director  Andre Hanekom  said in a statement e-mailed by the
Competition Commission today. The price of flour was cut by an
average of 350 rand ($51) a metric ton from Dec. 10, it said.  Pioneer, which produces Weet-Bix cereal and Heinz Tomato
Ketchup, earlier this year settled antitrust penalties worth
1.05 billion rand for price-fixing in flour and corn processing,
and collusion over flour, bread and corn prices.  The latest price cuts are aimed at reducing earnings from
Pioneer’s bread and bakery division by 160 million rand, part of
the total 660 million rand fine it agreed with the Competition
Commission, Hanekom said by mobile phone. “Further price
reductions will depend on volumes,” he said.  Pioneer has also started paying the 500 million rand cash
portion of the fine, having last week paid 67 million rand,
Hanekom said. “We will pay 217 million rand next year and
another 217 million the following year,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
