Yahoo! Inc. , owner of the largest
U.S. Web portal, is cutting about 600 jobs, or about 4 percent
of its  workforce , part of an almost two-year turnaround effort.  The notification process began today and most of the cuts
will come from the product group, said  Kim Rubey , a spokeswoman
for Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo. The company plans to
offer workers severance packages and outplacement services.  “Today’s personnel changes are part of our ongoing strategy
to best position Yahoo for revenue growth and margin expansion
and to support our strategy to deliver differentiated products
to the marketplace,” the company said in an e-mailed statement.
“We’ll continue to hire on a global basis to support our key
priorities.”  Chief Executive Officer  Carol Bartz , who joined  Yahoo  in
January 2009, made a larger round of cuts last year, in addition
to shutting underperforming websites. The company has struggled
to stanch a migration of users and advertising dollars to
Facebook Inc., which Yahoo now sees as its biggest rival.
Facebook passed Yahoo as the top seller of online display ads in
the U.S. a year ago, based on the number of times an ad is
viewed, according to Reston, Virginia-based ComScore Inc.  Yahoo  fell 7 cents to $16.63 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock is little changed in
value this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
