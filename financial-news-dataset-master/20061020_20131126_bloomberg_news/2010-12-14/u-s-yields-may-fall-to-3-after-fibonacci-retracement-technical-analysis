Treasury 10-year yields may fall
back toward 3 percent as technical indicators show the debt has
been oversold, according to  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce .  The rate surged to 3.49 percent yesterday, crossing the
61.8 percent retracement from the April high of 4 percent and a
low of 2.33 percent on Oct. 8, based on a series of numbers
known as Fibonacci sequence.  “Yields may fall toward 3 percent toward year-end, before
possibly retesting the 61.8 percent retracement level to form a
double-top,” said  Kazuaki Oh’e , the Tokyo-based executive
director of fixed income, currencies and distribution at
Canada’s fifth-largest lender.  The yield’s 14-day relative strength index is showing
"slightly excessive movement," Oh’e said. The RSI was at 73
yesterday, exceeding the 70 level some traders see as a sign an
asset’s value is poised to change direction.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
double-top occurs when a currency or security makes two
consecutive peaks of about the same height.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
