Brazil’s Securities Regulator, known
as CVM, said Sadia’s former Chief Financial Officer Adriano
Ferreira is prohibited from managing public companies for three
years, in a judgement concluded today in Rio de Janeiro.  CVM fined three former Sadia board members 400,000 reais,
and six others 200,000 reais, and found Cassio Casseb, Alcides Tapias,
Marcelo Fontana, and Roberto Faldini not guilty of 2008
irregularities in derivatives operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
