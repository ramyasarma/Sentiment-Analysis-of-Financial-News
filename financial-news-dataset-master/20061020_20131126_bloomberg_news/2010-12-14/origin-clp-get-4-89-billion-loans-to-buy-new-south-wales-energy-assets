Origin Energy Ltd. and CLP Holdings
Ltd. obtained A$4.9 billion ($4.89 billion) of loans to help
fund their acquisitions of New South Wales electricity assets.  Origin got an underwritten A$2.2 billion bridge facility
maturing in one to two years, and a A$1.1 billion three- to
five-year loan, also underwritten, that will be marketed to
other lenders in early 2011, according to a presentation filed
to the Australian stock exchange today. CLP Australia Finance, a
unit of Hong Kong-based CLP Holdings, signed a A$1.6 billion
revolving acquisition loan due May 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  CLP and Origin outbid AGL Energy Ltd. to gain customers in
Australia’s most-populous state as the local government sold
energy assets to bolster its finances. CLP unit TRUenergy
Holdings Pty is buying assets including the retail electricity
business EnergyAustralia for A$2.04 billion, while Origin is
paying A$3.25 billion for Country Energy and Integral Energy,
along with the rights to trade output generated by the Eraring
power station, the state said in an e-mailed statement today.  Origin will refinance some of its debt facilities with a
share sale within 12 months, the Sydney-based company said.  CLP’s facility was arranged by Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd., Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., National
Australia Bank Ltd. and Westpac Banking Corp., Bloomberg data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
