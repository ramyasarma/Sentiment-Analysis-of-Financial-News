Time Warner Cable Inc., the second-
largest U.S. cable operator, has named Chief Financial Officer
 Rob Marcus  president and chief operating officer.  Marcus replaces  Landel Hobbs , who is leaving the company,
New York-based Time Warner Cable said in a statement.  The executive changes are occurring as Time Warner Cable
struggles with subscriber losses as customers were hit with home
foreclosures and unemployment. Subscribers are also turning to
phone and satellite rivals, as well as to free Internet video
services.  The company lost 155,000 basic-video subscribers last
quarter and is experimenting with premium services, such as
appointments for technicians, and lower-priced video packages.  The cable industry also has been wrestling with fee
increases from programmers, which are typically passed along to
customers.  Marcus, a lawyer, joined Time Warner Cable in 2005 and has
served as CFO since 2008, the company said. He previously worked
as  Time Warner Inc. ’s senior vice president of mergers and
acquisitions. Marcus will continue as CFO temporarily while a
successor is sought, the company said.  Time Warner Cable  rose  31 cents to $64.94 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 57
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
