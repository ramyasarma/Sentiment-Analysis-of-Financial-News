Slovakia never considered dropping
the euro and talk about countries switching back to their
national currencies is "extremely risky" as it undermines
efforts to stabilize the region, Premier  Iveta Radicova  said.  Parliament Speaker  Richard Sulik  yesterday said Slovakia
needs a "Plan B" in case Europe’s debt crisis spreads further.
The government of the newest euro-area member "hasn’t for one
second" considered switching back to the Slovak koruna, Radicova
said at a conference today in Bratislava, the capital.  "Our task is to stabilize the euro," she said. "Any
thoughts about alternatives are weakening the stabilization
mechanism and I consider them extremely risky."  European Union leaders will meet in Brussels this week to
hash out a permanent crisis-resolution mechanism to replace the
440 billion-euro ($580 billion) stability fund created in May in
an attempt to halt the spread of the region’s sovereign-debt
woes. The current mechanism is scheduled to expire in 2013.  Radicova said today she would support the creation of a
permanent mechanism as long as it includes sanctions for fiscal
laggards, a possibility of a regulated sovereign bankruptcy with
private sector sharing losses. Slovakia, which adopted the euro
in 2009, is the only country in the 16-member block to reject
participating in a bailout of Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
