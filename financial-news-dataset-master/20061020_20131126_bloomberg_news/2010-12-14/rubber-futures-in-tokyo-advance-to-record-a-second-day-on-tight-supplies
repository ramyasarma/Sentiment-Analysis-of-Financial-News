Rubber extended a rally to an all-
time high as persistent rain in Thailand, the top producer and
exporter, lowered output, adding to worries over tightening
supply ahead of low-production season early next year. The cash
price in Thailand also reached a record.  May-delivery rubber on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange climbed
as much as 1.2 percent to 400.1 yen per kilogram (4,794 a metric
ton) before settling at 396.1 yen. The price has advanced 43.5
percent this year.  Shipments from Thailand decreased after heavy rainfall and
flooding pared latex production, worsening a supply shortage as
demand expands led by China, the largest user. Supply may drop
as Thai farmers reduce tree-tapping during the so-called
“wintering” season, said Kazuhiko Saito, an analyst at broker
Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  “Investors increased futures purchases on expectation that
tightening supply will boost prices in coming months,” Saito
said by phone today. “Manufacturers have no other options but
to buy the raw material as they draw down inventories.”  The  cash price  in Thailand climbed to a record 141.05 baht
a kilogram from 138.55 baht yesterday, the  Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand  said on its website today.  “Investors remain worried over limited supply from top
producers in Southeast Asia,”  Chaiwat Muenmee , analyst at DS
Futures Co., said today by phone from Bangkok.  Crude rubber stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses fell
7.6 percent to 6,816 tons at the end of last month, according to
data from the Rubber Trade Association of Japan.  Tire Prices  Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. , the second-largest
Japanese tiremaker, said it would increase product prices in
overseas markets by as much as 15 percent from January because
of record prices.  The announcement came after  Bridgestone Corp. , the world’s
largest tiremaker, said last week it would raise Japanese prices
of truck and bus tires by an average of 7 percent in March.  China’s sales of passenger cars including multipurpose and
sport-utility vehicles increased 29.3 percent to 1.34 million
last month, higher than the previous record of 1.32 million in
January, according to the  China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers . The pace of growth was the fastest since April.  Car sales in India rose 21 percent to 161,497 units last
month, according to the Society of Indian Automobile
Manufacturers. Rubber deficit in the country, the second-largest
consumer, may widen to 840,000 tons in 2020 from 175,000 tons
next year, Vinod Simon, president of the All India Rubber
Industries Association, said this month.  May-delivery rubber in Shanghai rose as much as 1.9 percent
to a one-month high of 35,990 yuan ($5,408) a ton before closing
at 35,535 yuan. The contract climbed to a record 38,920 yuan on
Nov. 11.  To contact the reporters on this story:
