Canadian stocks fell for the first
time in four days after Best Buy Co. cut its profit forecast and
the U.S. Federal Reserve said the economic recovery has been
“disappointingly slow.”  EnCana Corp., Canada’s largest natural gas producer,
decreased 1.7 percent as the fuel retreated on forecasts for
milder U.S. weather. Agrium Inc., Canada’s second-biggest
fertilizer producer, lost 1.7 percent as wheat futures slumped
the most in a month. Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest
lender by assets, dropped 0.9 percent as financial stocks
declined for the first time in six days.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  slipped 15.78
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,280.08.  “Some of the economic data have been improving over the
last couple of months, and I think a lot of investors are
looking for confirmation of that trend,” said  Youssef Zohny ,
who helps oversee C$50 million ($49.8 million) as an associate
portfolio manager at Van Arbor Asset Management Ltd. in
Vancouver. “What’s put a little bit of cold water on that today
is the forecast from Best Buy.”  The S&P/TSX rose 2.7 percent this month through yesterday
as oil rallied 5.4 percent and copper 10 percent. The index
gained as China refrained from raising interest rates even after
reporting record exports and manufacturing growth that surpassed
most economists’ estimates.  The Canadian benchmark erased earlier gains after the
statement from the U.S. central bank. Ten-year government-bond
yields in the U.S. and Canada increased to their highest levels
since May and June, respectively.  Missing Estimates  Best Buy, the world’s largest consumer-electronics
retailer, reported profit that trailed the average of 24
estimates in a Bloomberg survey by 10 percent. The company,
based in Richfield, Minnesota, also reduced its earnings
 forecast  for the year ending in February.  An index of  S&P/TSX energy stocks  fell from a 26-month high
as natural gas futures dropped 3.7 percent.  EnCana declined 1.7 percent to C$28.38. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., the country’s second-largest energy company by
market value, lost 0.6 percent to C$43.01. Petrobank Energy and
Resources Ltd., which produces oil and gas in Canada and
Colombia, decreased 2.4 percent to C$41.51.  TransGlobe Energy Corp., which produces oil and gas in
Egypt and Yemen, plunged 11 percent to C$15.20 after announcing
a 28 percent increase in its capital budget for next year. The
drop was the most in a day for TransGlobe in two years.  Wheat Retreat  Fertilizer stocks retreated as wheat futures fell 2.2
percent after surging 25 percent this year through yesterday.  Agrium dropped 1.7 percent to C$81.52. Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest fertilizer producer by
market value, slipped 0.4 percent to C$138.  Minefinders Corp., which produces gold and silver in
Mexico, sank 7.2 percent from a 10-month high to C$10.87. The
company, which had 66 million shares outstanding on Nov. 30,
said it will sell 13.7 million shares at C$11.10 a share.  Royal Bank, which derived  23 percent  of its revenue from
the U.S. in the third quarter, retreated 0.9 percent to C$52.34.
Toronto-Dominion Bank, which has about 1,300 U.S. branches, lost
0.5 percent to C$73.49. Manulife Financial Corp., North
America’s fourth-biggest insurer, decreased 0.7 percent to
C$16.67 to send the S&P/TSX Insurance Index to its first decline
this month.  To contact the reporters on this story;
