Telus Corp. , Canada’s third-largest
wireless carrier, predicted 2011 earnings that may top analysts’
estimates, helped by lower debt financing costs.  Earnings will likely rise to C$3.50 to C$3.90 a share, the
Vancouver-based company said today in a statement. Revenue will
climb 1 percent to 4 percent to C$9.93 billion ($9.8 billion)
and C$10.2 billion.  Analysts were expecting  profit excluding
some costs of C$3.58 a share on sales of C$9.99 billion,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Telus, whose shares have climbed 37 percent this year,
reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates last
month, helped by new wireless subscribers, lower reorganization
costs and savings from bond refinancing. The company is also
benefiting from the commodity-driven economy in its base in
Western Canada that has cushioned consumers better than in
Ontario, home to  Rogers Communications Inc. , Canada’s largest
wireless carrier.  Telus  rose  30 cents to C$46.71 at 4 p.m. on the Toronto
Stock Exchange.  Earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and
depreciation will climb by as much as 6 percent next year, Telus
said. The company left its 2010 forecasts unchanged at C$9.7
billion to C$9.95 billion in sales and C$3.10 to C$3.30 a share
in profit.  Telus also said it will make a C$200 million contribution
to its defined-benefit pension plans, bringing them to about 97
percent funding. The contribution will cut 2011 pension expenses
by C$13 million and cash taxes by C$57 million.  BCE Inc., Canada’s second-largest wireless carrier, last
week announced a C$750 million contribution to its pension plan
that will help eliminate a deficit in 2014, cut pension costs
and boost adjusted earnings by 3 cents a share in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
