Somalia’s government banned several
international aid agencies, including the United Nations
Children’s Fund, Unicef, and the International Committee of the
Red Cross, after they didn’t attend a scheduled meeting.  The ministry of water, minerals and energy had called the
meeting for 10 a.m. yesterday, Abdirahman Yusuf Farah, deputy
minister, told reporters in the capital, Mogadishu, today.  “These agencies failed to came to the meeting, so the
ministry decided to officially ban them from working in
Somalia,” Farah said. He didn’t say how long the ban would
last.  The other agencies to be banned were Daryeel Bulsho Guud
DBG and the Norwegian Refugee Council. Many of Somalia’s poor
have depended on aid for years in a country that hasn’t had a
functioning central administration since the ouster of former
dictator  Mohamed Siad Barre  in 1991.  No one answered the phone at the Unicef Somalia Support
Center in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, when Bloomberg called
seeking comment today.  “Officially we didn’t receive a statement from the
transitional federal government,” Yves Van Loo, a spokesman for
the ICRC delegation for Somalia, said in a phone interview from
Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
