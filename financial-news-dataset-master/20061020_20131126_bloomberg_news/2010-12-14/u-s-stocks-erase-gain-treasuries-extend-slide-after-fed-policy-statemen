U.S. stocks erased gains as
Treasuries extended their retreat after the Federal Reserve
announced that it will continue its $600 billion asset-purchase
program to stimulate the economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,240.2 at 3:25 p.m. in New York after rallying as much as 0.5
percent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped 21 basis
points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 3.48 percent. The Dollar
Index, a gauge of the currency against six major peers, climbed
0.2 percent to 79.463.  "The U.S. Treasury market is getting hammered," said Peter 
Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York. 
"For the first time in this multi-year experiment on the part 
of the Fed, the bond market has taken over and has pushed back 
against the Fed's goal of keeping interest rates low. Stock 
investors have to learn to start paying attention to it."  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
