Japan reached an agreement with the
U.S. to maintain its funding for hosting American military bases
at the current level for the next five years, halting a decade-
long decline.  Japan will continue to pay about 188 billion yen ($2.25
billion) a year, according to a document released today by the
Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry. Under the agreement,
Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s government will reduce some labor and
utility costs while increasing spending to improved insulation
and other environmental concerns.  The U.S. has about 47,000 troops  stationed  in Japan as part
of a 50-year-old security treaty. More than 75 percent of the
American bases are on the southern island of Okinawa, which has
caused tensions with the local residents. Ties between the two
countries soured during an eight-month dispute over relocating a
U.S. Marine base on Okinawa.  “The agreement shows a deepening Japan-U.S. alliance,”
Chief Cabinet Secretary  Yoshito Sengoku  told reporters today in
Tokyo. “It’s a message by the two governments to keep the
alliance working for peace and stability throughout East Asia.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
