Hong Kong’s benchmark stock index 
rose to the highest level in more than a week as exporters
gained ahead of a report expected to show U.S. retail sales
climbed in the world’s biggest economy.  Li & Fung Ltd., the No. 1 supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
advanced 1.6 percent.  Techtronic Industries Co. , the maker of
Hoover vacuum cleaners and Ryobi power tools, increased 5.7
percent. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s largest
maker of the lightweight metal, climbed 1.3 percent after metal
prices gained.  The  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.5 percent to 23,431.19, its
highest close since Dec. 2. Gains were limited ahead of a
meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve today at which policy makers
will discuss increasing their bond purchase program.  Exporters benefit from “the economic recovery story,
though it won’t be a smooth one,” said  Steven Leung , director
of institutional sales at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The
market is generally quiet and investors in Hong Kong are
cautious. There isn’t much interest to get into the market at
this point.”  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies climbed 0.9 percent to 12,865.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
