UniCredit SpA , Italy’s biggest bank,
raised its forecast for Bulgarian  gross domestic product  this
year and next, citing rising exports.  The economy will grow 0.1 percent this year, compared with
an earlier estimate for a 0.5 percent contraction, and GDP will
expand 2.8 percent in 2011, instead of 2.2 percent, UniCredit
said in an e-mailed report today. The government estimates 0.7
percent economic growth in 2010 and 3.6 percent in 2011. GDP
shrank 5 percent in 2009.  Bulgaria, the poorest EU country, is emerging from its
deepest economic slump in 12 years after a three-year lending
boom stalled and foreign investment dried up. The economy grew
0.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the first
annual increase after six quarters of contraction.  “The export-led portion of the economy fully regained its
competitiveness and is again creating new jobs," UniCredit said.
"Excessive enthusiasm would be premature, the economy still
needs to face the challenge of rebalancing domestic demand-
oriented sectors."  Exports may grow 12.1 percent this year and 6.2 percent in
2011 after a 10.3 percent contraction in 2009, UniCredit said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
