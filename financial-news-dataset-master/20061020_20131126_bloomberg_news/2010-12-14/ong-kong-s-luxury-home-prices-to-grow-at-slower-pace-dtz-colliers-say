Hong Kong’s luxury home prices,
which have gained more than 60 percent since early 2009, may
grow at a slower pace in 2011 as government measures to curb
real estate values divert investments to other property sectors,
according to real-estate brokers DTZ and Savills Plc  The value of luxury homes, classified as those with an area
of at least 100 square meters (1,076 square feet) by the  Hong
Kong Monetary Authority , may rise 8 percent in 2011,  Ricky Poon ,
executive director of residential sales at Colliers
International in Hong Kong, told reporters in a briefing today.  Hong Kong on Nov. 19 intensified a yearlong battle to curb
surging  home prices  with additional taxes and policies a day
after the International Monetary Fund warned that asset
inflation may derail the city’s economy. Homes sold within six
months of purchase will now incur a 15 percent stamp duty, and
down payments will increase for most mortgages, with those for
homes costing at least HK$12 million ($1.5 million) rising to 50
percent from 40 percent.  “The government measures may lead some investors to switch
to investing in office and retail properties,” said  Charles Chan , a Hong Kong-based managing director at the valuation
department of Savills who expects luxury home price to rise
about 10 percent to 20 percent next year.  Hong Kong’s residential transactions may fall as much as 35
percent in 2011 from 2010 after the government measures to make
homes more affordable, according to  Midland Holdings Ltd.,  the
city’s biggest realtor by market value.  Overall home prices may drop by as much as 10 percent over
the next three months, according to Collier’s Poon.  The share of luxury homes for real estate transaction over
HK$100 million ($12.9 million) in value fell to 17 percent in
the fourth quarter from 26 percent in the third quarter,
according to Alvin Yip, co-head of China investment at DTZ. By
contrast, the share of office properties rose to 48 percent in
the fourth quarter from 33 percent in the third, he said.  “The recent measures are affecting buyers’ appetite toward
luxury residential properties,” said Yip. “Office is expected
to remain popular over the next year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
