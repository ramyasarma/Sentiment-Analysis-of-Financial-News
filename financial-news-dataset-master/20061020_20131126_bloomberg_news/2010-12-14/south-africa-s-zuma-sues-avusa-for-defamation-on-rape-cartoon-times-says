South African President  Jacob Zuma 
sued Avusa Media for defamation, claiming 5 million rand
($731,000), after it published a cartoon of him preparing to
rape Lady Justice, the  Times  reported, citing court documents.  The Sept. 7, 2008, cartoon published in the Sunday Times
newspaper damaged his reputation, Zuma claims, according to the
Johannesburg-based newspaper. The  Sunday Times’  former editor-
in-chief and the cartoonist are respondents in the lawsuit,
together with  Avusa .  The cartoon was understood by readers to mean that the
President abused the justice system, according to the court
papers, the Times said.  Zuma’s spokesman Zizi Kodwa’s mobile phone wasn’t answered
when called by Bloomberg News and the phone wasn’t taking
messages. No one was available at Avusa Ltd. to comment when its
head office in Johannesburg was called out of normal office
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
