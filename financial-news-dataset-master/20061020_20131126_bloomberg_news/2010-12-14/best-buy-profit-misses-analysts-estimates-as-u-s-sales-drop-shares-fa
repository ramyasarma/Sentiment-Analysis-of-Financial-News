Best Buy Co. , the world’s largest
consumer-electronics retailer, lowered its annual earnings
forecast and reported an  unexpected  4.4 percent drop in third-
quarter profit, citing weaker demand for televisions and
entertainment gadgets in the U.S.  Net income fell to $217 million, or 54 cents a share, in
the three months ended Nov. 27, from $227 million, or 53 cents,
a year earlier, the Richfield, Minnesota-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts projected 60 cents, the average
of 24  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The shares sank.  Best Buy said its U.S. market share for the full year will
decline because of weaker-than-expected sales of televisions,
computers and video game software. The retailer and rivals
including  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  have cut prices for electronics
to lure U.S. consumers pinched by unemployment.  “The U.S. business was pretty miserable,”  Joe Feldman , an
analyst at Telsey Advisory Group in New York, said in an
interview, referring to Best Buy. “Sales are going to places
like Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target, Costco and Sears.”  Full-year profit will drop to $3.20 to $3.40 a share,
reduced from a previous forecast of $3.55 to $3.70. Analysts
 predicted  $3.59, on average. The company earned $3.10 last year.  Third-quarter sales fell 1.1 percent to $11.9 billion last
quarter, missing the $12.4 billion average of analysts’
estimates.  Best Buy  tumbled $5.64, or 14 percent, to $36.06 at 9:21
a.m. before the opening of the New York Stock Exchange. Before
today, the shares had increased 5.7 percent this year.  Industrywide sales at U.S. retailers rose more than
forecast in November as holiday shopping got under way.
Purchases increased 0.8 percent, following a 1.7 percent gain in
October that was larger than previously estimated, according to
Commerce Department figures released today in Washington. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was a
0.6 percent rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
