European Union carbon permits fell
for a second day as German power prices declined, weakening
demand for emission allowances.  EU permits for delivery this month lost 0.4 percent to
14.47 euros ($19.37) a metric ton as of 4:39 p.m. on London’s
ICE Futures Europe exchange. Allowances for December 2011
dropped 0.5 percent to 14.78 euros, extending their loss to 1.7
percent so far this month.  German baseload power for next year lost as much as 1.5
percent to 48.90 euros a megawatt-hour, the lowest price since
Nov. 30, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg. Lower
prices can reduce the incentive to sell electricity forward,
curbing demand for CO2 permits.  UN carbon credits for delivery in December 2011 advanced
0.6 percent to 11.50 euros before an EU meeting scheduled to
discuss a proposal to ban certain offsets from the use in
Europe’s cap-and-trade program.  The Climate Change Committee, composed of representatives
of national governments, will for the first time debate a draft
measure by the European Commission to prohibit the use of UN
offsets related to hydrofluorocarbon-23 and nitrous oxide for
compliance in the EU as of Jan. 1, 2013.  The International Emissions Trading Association today
called on the commission and the EU’s 27 member states to
reconsider the proposed ban. The bloc could consider delaying
the planned entry into force of the ban to May 1, 2013, and
provide for banking of international credits from emission
reductions achieved up to Dec. 31, 2012, Geneva-based IETA said.  The Climate Change Committee may also vote tomorrow on a
draft EU regulation setting carbon-efficiency benchmarks to
assign a dwindling supply of free emission permits to industries
when the next trading period starts in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
