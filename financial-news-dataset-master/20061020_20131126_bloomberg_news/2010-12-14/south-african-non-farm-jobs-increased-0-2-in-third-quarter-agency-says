South Africa, which has the highest
 unemployment  rate of 62 countries tracked by Bloomberg, added
fewer jobs in the third quarter than the previous three months,
as the economy’s recovery lost momentum.  Employment in formal, non-agricultural industries rose 0.2
percent, or 17,000, to 8.15 million, Pretoria-based  Statistics
South Africa  said in a report on its website today. That’s down
from a revised 46,000 jobs created in the second quarter.  The government’s goal is to create 5 million jobs by 2020
to help cut the unemployment rate to 15 percent from 25.3
percent currently. That requires economic growth of between 4
percent and 7 percent a year, according to a plan published by
Economic Development Minister  Ebrahim Patel  on Nov. 23.
Expansion of Africa’s biggest economy will be “disappointing”
at less than 3 percent this year, central bank Governor  Gill Marcus  said on Dec. 8.  “To create more jobs, companies need to have confidence
that the economy is growing and demand for their products will
increase,” said Salomi Odendaal, an economist at Citadel
Investment Services in Cape Town. “While growth rates in
sectors such as the automotive industry have picked up, the
actual level of activity is still very low.”  Growth Slows  Economic  growth  slowed to an annualized 2.6 percent in the
third quarter, as the rand’s rally against the dollar and weak
global demand led to a slump in manufacturing, the statistics
office said on Nov. 23.  The  manufacturing  industry, which accounts for 15 percent
of the economy, shed 7,000 jobs in the third quarter from the
previous three months, when it cut 17,000 jobs, the statistics
office said today. Employment in construction dropped 1.7
percent, or 7,000 jobs, in the quarter.  That was offset by a 0.7 percent increase in jobs in the
retail trade industry, a 0.2 percent rise in employment in
financial services and a 1.2 percent jump in mining jobs, the
statistics office said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
