Canadian stocks  fell for a second
day as the U.S. dollar rose and metal prices dropped after
Moody’s Investors Service said it might cut Spain’s credit
rating.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer of the
metal, declined 1.5 percent as the U.S. currency rose against 14
of 16 major counterparts. Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s biggest
base-metals and coal producer, lost 2.3 percent as copper fell
the most in three weeks. Toronto-Dominion Bank, the country’s
second-largest lender by assets, decreased 1.1 percent as
financial shares slumped.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  retreated 51.01
points, or 0.4 percent, to 13,229.07 after Moody’s said it may
reduce Spain’s credit rating by one or two levels from Aa1.  “Any negative news like that gives investors another
reason to pause a little bit and say, ‘What’s really going on
here?’,” said  Adrian Mastracci , a money manager at KCM Wealth
Management Inc. in Vancouver and leader in the Globe & Mail’s
annual stock-picking competition for financial professionals.
“Nobody really knows how it’s going to shake out.”  The S&P/TSX is  outgaining  the S&P 500 for the seventh
straight year due in part to a 34 percent surge in the Canadian
benchmark’s raw-materials stocks through yesterday. Gold jumped
28 percent on concern that central-bank efforts to boost the
money supply will fuel inflation, while copper soared 26 percent
as the Chinese economy grew faster than 10 percent for the first
three quarters of the year.  Funding Stress  The U.S. dollar climbed the most in three weeks against
currencies of six major trade partners today after the
announcement from Moody’s led investors to sell euros. Spain’s
funding requirements “make the country susceptible to further
episodes of funding stress,”  Kathrin Muehlbronner , an analyst
at Moody’s, said in a report.  Gold futures, which tend to move in an opposite direction
from the U.S. currency, fell 1.3 percent to $1,386.20 an ounce
in New York.  Barrick dropped 1.5 percent to C$52.75. Agnico-Eagle Mines
Ltd., Canada’s fifth-largest gold producer, declined for a
 seventh day , slumping 2.6 percent to C$80.79. Semafo Inc., which
mines gold in Africa, sank 5 percent to C$11.44. Silver reseller
Silver Wheaton Corp. lost 3.5 percent to C$38.07 as the metal
retreated 1.8 percent.  Copper fell from a 31-month high in New York. Teck declined
2.3 percent to C$56.54. First Quantum Minerals Ltd., Canada’s
second-largest publicly traded copper producer, lost 2.7 percent
to C$111.92.  Gas Slips  Most  S&P/TSX energy companies  retreated as natural gas
slipped to a two-week low.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the country’s second-
biggest energy company by market value, fell 1 percent to
C$42.50. Nexen Inc., an oil and gas producer with operations on
 five continents , dropped 1.8 percent to C$22.03. Pacific
Rubiales Energy Corp., which produces oil in Colombia, declined
3.7 percent to C$32.28.  TD and Royal Bank of Canada, which derive a higher portion
of their revenue from the U.S. than do any other Canadian banks,
retreated as the Canadian dollar gained for a sixth day against
its U.S. equivalent.  TD decreased 1.1 percent to C$72.68. Royal Bank, the
largest Canada-based bank, slipped 0.7 percent to C$52.  BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. fell 2.3 percent
to C$59.48. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter
 earnings  tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story;
