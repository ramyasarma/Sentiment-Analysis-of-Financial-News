Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi 
will probably lose today’s confidence ballot by two votes,
prompting as many as 60 of his lawmakers to defect and help form
a new government without him, said a former ally of Berlusconi.  “There are those 50, 60 lawmakers of Berlusconi’s party
who, once Berlusconi has fallen, will betray him in a second,”
said  Luca Barbareschi , who quit Berlusconi  People of Liberty
party  to join with rebel lawmakers who are trying to bring down
the prime minister.  He said that Berlusconi will likely lose today’s key no-
confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament by “a couple
of votes” and that would prompt as the lawmakers to abandon the
premier.  The  Northern League , Berlusconi’s main coalition ally, is
also ready to “pull the plug” on the premier, he said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
