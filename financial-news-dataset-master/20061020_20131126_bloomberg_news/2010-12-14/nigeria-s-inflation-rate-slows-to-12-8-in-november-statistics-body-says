Nigeria’s  inflation rate slowed for
a third consecutive month in November, the National Bureau of
Statistics said.  The rate declined to 12.8 percent, compared with
13.4 percent a month earlier, the bureau, based in the capital,
Abuja, said today in a statement published on its  website .  The three straight slowdowns mean the Central Bank of
Nigeria should begin “quantitative easing,” said  Ayo Teriba ,
chief executive officer of Economic Associates Ltd., a Lagos-
based company that advises businesses, in a phone interview.  The bank, which is targeting an inflation rate of less than
10 percent, kept its key lending rate at 6.25 percent on Nov.
