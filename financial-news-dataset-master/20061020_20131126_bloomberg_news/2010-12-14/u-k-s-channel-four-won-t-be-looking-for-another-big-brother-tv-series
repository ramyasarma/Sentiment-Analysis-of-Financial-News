Channel Four Television Corp., the
U.K. publicly-owned broadcaster that’s commercially funded,
won’t attempt to replace the “Big Brother” television series
with a similar show as the contract ends.  The broadcaster, which opted not to renew the rights deal
for the show after 2010, will aim for a “more balanced”
schedule, with a number of “quite big hits,” Chief Executive
Officer  David Abraham  told a committee of U.K. lawmakers,
according to a statement today.  “Big Brother was the kind of show that happens in the
television industry once in a decade and we should not be
looking for the next Big Brother,” Abraham said.  The series, which started in the U.K. in 2000, reached more
than 10 million viewers. The series showed the life of a group
of contestants who live isolated from the outside world in a
house monitored by cameras and microphones. London-based Channel
Four will trial new programs at the beginning of next year,
Abraham said.  The lawmakers said today they “do underestimate the size
of the challenge facing Channel 4” as it tries to retain
ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
