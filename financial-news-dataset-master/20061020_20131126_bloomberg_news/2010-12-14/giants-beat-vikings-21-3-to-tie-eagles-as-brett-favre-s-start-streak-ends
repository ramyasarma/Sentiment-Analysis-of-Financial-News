The New York Giants beat the
Minnesota Vikings 21-3 behind rushing touchdowns from  Ahmad Bradshaw  and  Brandon Jacobs  to tie the Philadelphia Eagles for
the division lead.  Vikings quarterback  Brett Favre  sat out the game with a
shoulder injury, ending his National Football League-record
streak of 297 straight starts, a run that started 18 years ago.  Without Favre, the Vikings’ offense was held to 164 total
yards at Ford Field in Detroit. The game, originally scheduled
to be played yesterday, was moved after the roof of the
Metrodome in Minneapolis partially collapsed because of snow.  Bradshaw and Jacobs each had more than 100 rushing yards
for the Giants, who improved to 9-4 to tie the Eagles atop the
National Football Conference’s East Division. The Giants host
the Eagles on Dec. 19.  New York scored three straight touchdowns after the Vikings
took a 3-0 first-quarter lead on a 21-yard field goal by  Ryan Longwell .  Jacobs, who ran for 116 yards, gave the Giants a 7-3 lead
with a one-yard touchdown run midway through the second quarter.
The Giants scored again eight seconds before halftime as
quarterback  Eli Manning , who made his 100th straight start,
threw a six-yard touchdown pass to  Kevin Boss .  Bradshaw pushed the Giants’ lead to 21-3 with a 48-yard
touchdown run with 2:55 left in the third quarter. Bradshaw had
103 rushing yards for the Giants, who have won three straight
games since a 27-17 loss in Philadelphia on Nov. 21.  Tarvaris Jackson  started in place of Favre and had 118
passing yards and an interception for the Vikings, who had a
two-game winning streak snapped to fall to 5-8. It was the first
loss for interim coach  Leslie Frazier , who was promoted when
 Brad Childress  was fired last month after a 3-7 start.  To contact the reporter on this story:
