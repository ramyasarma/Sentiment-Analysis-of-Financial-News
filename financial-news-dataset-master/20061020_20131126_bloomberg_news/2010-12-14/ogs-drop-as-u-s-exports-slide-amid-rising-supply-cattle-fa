Hog prices fell as demand for U.S.
pork declined amid rising supplies. Cattle futures also dropped.  U.S. pork shipments fell 9.5 percent in October from a year
earlier, according to the most-recent U.S. Department of
Agriculture data. Hog  carcasses  averaged 208.88 pounds (94.7
kilograms) on Dec. 10, USDA data show. Weights have climbed 4.4
percent since Sept. 1.  “It’s another month of poor exports,” said  Paul Beere , a
market adviser at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield, Wisconsin. “That doesn’t bode very well for future
demand, especially with pork production being up, mostly due to
weights being higher.”  Hog futures for February settlement dropped 0.2 cent, or
0.3 percent, to 76.125 cents a pound at 1:07 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The commodity has gained 16 percent this
year.  Meatpackers have processed 844,000 hogs this week, down 0.8
percent from a week earlier, according to USDA data. The  price 
of hogs for immediate delivery fell 2.2 percent yesterday to
65.48 cents a pound.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.425 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $1.04525 a pound. The price is up 21 percent
this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement declined 1.075
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.18825 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
