U.S. stock-index futures advanced
after retail sales growth topped economists’ estimates and
investors awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s policy
meeting.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March gained 0.2 percent to 1,238.2 at 8:40 a.m. in New York.
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased 0.1 percent to
11,377. Futures  erased  gains earlier after Best Buy Co.’s
earnings and profit forecast trailed estimates.  Retail purchases increased 0.8 percent, following a 1.7
percent gain in October that was larger than previously
estimated, Commerce Department figures showed today in
Washington. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 0.6 percent rise. Excluding autos,
gasoline and building materials, which are the figures used to
calculate gross domestic product, sales climbed 0.9 percent, the
most since August.  The S&P 500 is up 18 percent since Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke indicated on Aug. 27 that he was considering pumping
more cash into financial markets through bond purchases. The
central bank announced after its November meeting that it would
buy $600 billion in Treasuries in a second round of quantitative
easing.  The S&P 500 yesterday rose 0.06 point to 1,240.46 and
climbed as high as 1,246.73 earlier in the day, almost
surpassing 1,251.7, its last closing level before the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sent the gauge to a 46 percent
plunge through March 2009.  Fed officials are likely to make no change to their
economic stimulus package when they meet today in Washington for
the last time this year, according to 38 of 39 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey Dec. 7-8. Bernanke may find his options for
reducing unemployment near a 26-year high are constrained after
Republicans take control of the House of Representatives next
month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
