Lance Armstrong ’s comeback helped
add $32 million in sales last year for the company that runs the
Tour de France.  Amaury Sport Organisation said the seven-time champion’s
duel with  Alberto Contador  encouraged Volkswagen AG’s Skoda and
France Telecom SA’s Orange among other companies to renew
advertizing agreements, according to a company filing.  Sales from ASO’s sports events rose 20 percent to 145.2
million euros ($195.4 million) and the Tour’s global television
audience increased 10 percent. Net income fell 1.2 percent to
31.8 million euros.  “The Armstrong-Contador duel was certainly not irrelevant
to the success” of the race, said the Dec. 1 filing to a
company registry in Nanterre, France, mailed to Bloomberg News.
The financial targets of the Tour de France were “slightly”
surpassed, the filing added.  Contador won the 2009 race and Armstrong finished third on
his return after three years of retirement. Armstrong, 39,
finished 23rd this year in what he said will be his last time
competing in the Tour.  ASO, owned by the Amaury family, also controls smaller
events like the Paris-Dakar rally and Paris marathon. The rally
was held in Latin America the last two years because of
terrorist concerns in northern Africa.  Financial support from Chile and Argentina helped make the
car race “slightly” more profitable in 2010, the filing said,
without being more specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
