Imagination Technologies Group Plc ,
the U.K. chip designer that has  Intel Corp.  as its largest
shareholder, aims to license designs to mobile-phone operators
after the purchase of Web-telephone company HelloSoft.  The acquisition of HelloSoft gives the company access to
companies such as Skype Technologies SA, the largest provider of
international Web calling, Imagination Technologies Chief
Executive Officer  Hossein Yassaie  said today in a phone
interview.  “Skype is a customer of HelloSoft for a set of handsets,”
Yassaie said. “There is no reason why every operator would not
want to have that service. It is able to deliver Skype-like
technology to everyone.”  Imagination Technologies agreed to buy San Jose,
California-based HelloSoft in November for as much as $47
million to integrate Internet voice and video calling services
into its own chip designs. Imagination Technologies said today
first-half sales rose 16 percent to 44.1 million pounds ($70
million) while net income almost doubled to 11.7 million pounds.  Imagination Tech shares gained as much as 5.7 percent to
380 pence in London trading and were up 5.1 percent as of 10:23
a.m. The stock of the Kings Langley, England-based company has
climbed 57 percent this year.  Skype, based in Luxembourg, in August announced plans for
an initial public offering.  EBay Inc.  sold most of its stake in
Skype last year for about $2 billion to a group led by private-
equity firm Silver Lake. Skype had $705 million in revenue last
year, a 28 percent increase from 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
