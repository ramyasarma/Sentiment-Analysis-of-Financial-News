First Solar Inc. , the world’s
biggest maker of thin-film solar modules, said 2011 sales will
climb to $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion on increasing demand for
renewable energy in the U.S. and Canada.  First Solar was expected to have revenue of $3.62 billion
next year, up from about $2.6 billion this year, according to
the average of 40  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Net
income will be $8.75 to $9.50 a share, the Tempe, Arizona-based
company said in a statement today. That’s higher than the
average analyst estimate of $8.53 a share.  “We are benefitting from diversifying global partner
demand and an increase in revenue from utility-scale projects,”
Chief Executive Officer  Rob Gillette  said in the statement.  First Solar also said it agreed to sell its 290-megawatt
Agua Caliente project in Yuma County, Arizona, to a unit of  NRG
Energy Inc.  The project has a 25-year power purchase agreement
with  PG&E Corp. ’s Pacific Gas & Electric Co.  The statement was released after the close of regular U.S.
trading. First Solar climbed $3.46, or 2.5 percent, to $140.50
at 4:22 p.m. in late trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
