European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said European governments should consider
extending and broadening the region’s bailout fund, stepping up
pressure on leaders to fight the fiscal crisis.  “We’re calling for maximum flexibility and maximum
capacity, quantitatively and qualitatively,” Trichet told
reporters at an event in Frankfurt late yesterday, responding to
a question whether the European Financial Stability Facility
should be able to buy government bonds.  The ECB is pushing governments to shoulder more of the
burden in tackling the fiscal crisis after Ireland was forced
last month to seek a bailout, sparking concern that contagion
will spread through the euro region. The ECB last week bought
the most sovereign debt since June and Spanish bonds today fell
for a seventh day as it paid more in a debt sale.  “The Governing Council is clearly quite reluctant to step
up its own bond purchases so therefore, they’re implicitly
calling on governments to address tensions in bond markets,”
said  Julian Callow , chief European economist at Barclays Capital
in London. “At the end of the day, the ECB is concerned about
its long-term credibility.”  Capital Base  Council member  Ewald Nowotny  said on Dec. 10 that European
central banks have been forced to take on “a whole range of
extra risk” and may need more capital. Trichet said he has “no
particular comment” on the topic. Vice President  Vitor Constancio  said on Dec. 10 that an increase of the rescue fund
and more flexibility would be “helpful.”  EU leaders meeting in Brussels for a summit in two days are
divided over the next steps in containing the debt crisis.
Germany and France have rejected increasing the bailout fund and
dismissed calls by Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg to issue joint
euro-region government bonds. Trichet yesterday signaled support
for the German and French position.  “In the previous period, the ECB had said that it was not
necessarily appropriate to have such type of bonds,” Trichet
said. “We were very clear on that. At this stage, there is no
new position on the Governing Council of the ECB.”  Governments across the region have embarked on programs to
bring deficits back in line with the European Union’s budget
rules. The Irish government last week pledged spending cuts
worth 6 billion euros in 2011 ranging from child benefits to
government salaries to push down the country’s budget shortfall.  Soothe Tensions  “I am sure that the program is suited to bring about a
sustainable stabilization of the Irish economy and soothe
tensions in financial markets that are associated with the Irish
fiscal problems and the reorganization of its banking sector,”
Trichet said. “The program will also contribute to restoring
confidence and safeguarding financial stability in the euro area
as a whole.”  Several euro-area governments are facing “difficult”
market conditions, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said
today. Belgium had the outlook on its credit rating cut to
“negative” from “stable” by S&P and Spanish bonds fell as
the country paid higher costs to sell more than 2.5 billion
euros of securities.  The extra yield that investors demand to hold Spanish 10-
year government bonds rose nine basis points to 257 basis points
today. It touched a euro-era closing high of 283 points on Nov.
30.  Trichet also said that governments need to do more to
toughen fiscal rules and they stopped short of more automatic
penalties that the ECB had demanded.  Quantum Leap  “These proposals in our view do not yet represent the
quantum leap in economic governance that is needed to be fully
commensurate with the monetary union we have created,” Trichet
said. Sanctions should be applied in a “quasi-automatic” way
and include fines and “possible limitations of voting rights
for member states in persistence violation,” he said.  The Frankfurt-based central bank on Dec. 2 delayed its
withdrawal of unconventional measures, extending unlimited
liquidity supply for the financial sector into the second
quarter of 2011. The ECB that day also kept its benchmark
interest rate at a record low of 1 percent.  “We consider the two tools we’re utilizing, the standard
measures, the interest rates, and the non-standard measures, as
being relatively independent,” Trichet said. “We could go up
and down with one tool and let the other unchanged and do the
same with the other tool.”  Addicted Banks  The ECB is seeking ways to reduce banks’ dependence on
emergency-liquidity measures. A “small number of institutions”
is “excessively reliant on central bank liquidity,” it said in
a report published last week.  “We look at all elements that would permit us to be back
at a normal situation, which calls for our own non-standard
measures to be progressively phased out” and “for banks to
have a normal attitude” towards ECB liquidity, Trichet said.
“We try to help the overall move in this direction. Of course
we have to take into account reality.”  Trichet said the ECB is “extraordinarily attached” to
keeping its monetary policy stance “unchanged” at the moment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
