Most  Canadian stocks  rose after an
bigger-than-forecast increase in U.S. retail sales signaled that
consumer spending will support the economic recovery.  BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. climbed 1 percent
after at least two analysts boosted their share-price estimates
on the stock. Minefinders Corp., which produces gold and silver
in Mexico, tumbled 8.5 percent after announcing a share
offering. Telus Corp., Canada’s third-largest wireless carrier,
gained 1 percent after saying 2011 earnings may top analysts’
forecasts.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  increased 14.69
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,310.55 at 10:44 a.m. in Toronto.
Among stocks in the index, 135 advanced, 94 declined and five
were unchanged.  The S&P/TSX rose 2.7 percent this month through yesterday
