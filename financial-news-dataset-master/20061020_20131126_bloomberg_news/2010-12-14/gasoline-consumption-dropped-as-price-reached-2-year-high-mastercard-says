U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump
slid 2.7 percent last week as retail prices rose to the highest
level in 25 months, according to data in a  MasterCard Inc. 
SpendingPulse report.  Motorists bought an average 9.18 million barrels of the
fuel a day in the week ended Dec. 10, the second-biggest
payments network company said today. That’s the first decline in
three weeks and biggest week-to-week drop since Sept. 10.  Fuel demand was 1.3 percent below the same period a year
earlier. That’s the largest drop in year-over-year consumption
since Oct. 29.  The  average pump price  for regular gasoline rose 9 cents to
$2.96 a gallon, the highest level since Oct. 17, 2008. The price
was 13 percent above a year earlier.  Averaged over four weeks, gasoline consumption was 9.27
million barrels a day, down 0.3 percent from a year earlier. The
four-week average has been below the year-earlier level for 12
consecutive weeks.  Fuel use slipped last week in six of the seven geographic
regions. Demand was down 3.8 percent on the Gulf Coast and in
the Lower Atlantic, 3.4 percent on the West Coast, 2.5 percent
in the Central Atlantic, 2.1 percent in the Midwest and 1.7
percent in the Rocky Mountain area. Consumption rose 3 percent
in New England.  Through Dec. 10, drivers had purchased 0.4 percent more
gasoline in 2010 than during the same period in 2009, the same
as the prior week, MasterCard said.  The highest demand this year was 9.71 million barrels a day
in the week ended May 28. The lowest was 8.84 million in the
week ended Sept. 10.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc.  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
