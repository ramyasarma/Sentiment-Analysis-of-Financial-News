Qatar hasn’t any plans to issue
bonds to cover the cost of the 2022 soccer World Cup that will
be hosted by the Persian Gulf state, Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad
Bin Jasim Bin Jaber Al-Thani said.  The costs involved were already “70 percent to 80
percent” covered by the government, Sheikh Hamad said today at
the opening of a courtroom at Qatar Financial Centre.
Infrastructure for the event would take about seven years to
build, and most of the projects were already planned before the
country won the right to host the World Cup, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
