Finance Bank Zambia Ltd., the
country’s biggest privately owned lender, is operating normally
and customers shouldn’t be concerned about reports of higher
than normal withdrawals, the Bank of Zambia said.  “There is absolutely no cause for alarm regarding a run,”
Kanguya Mayondi, spokesman for the Lusaka-based central bank,
said by phone today. Bank of Zambia officials are watching all
39 branches and normal banking occurred on Dec. 11 and
yesterday, he said.  Finance Bank, partly owned by  Credit Suisse Group AG ,
experienced high withdrawals by depositors concerned the bank
will close, the Post reported, citing unidentified Finance Bank
officials.  FirstRand Ltd.  of South Africa has been managing
Finance Bank since Dec. 11 after the central bank accused the
Zambian bank of breaching financial laws.  The central bank hasn’t imposed limits on withdrawals to
“continue instilling confidence,” Mayondi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
