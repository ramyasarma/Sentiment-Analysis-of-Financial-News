Optimism among U.S. chief executives
in the fourth quarter rose to the highest level since the start
of 2006 as business leaders projected increased sales,
investment and  hiring , a private survey showed.  The  Business Roundtable’s  economic outlook index climbed to
101 after falling in the previous quarter for the first time
since the beginning of 2009, the Washington-based group said
today. Readings higher than 50 coincide with an economic
expansion. The gauge, which increased from a third-quarter
reading of 86, rose to 102 in the  first quarter  of 2006.  Forty-five percent of respondents said they will add to
payrolls, an increase of 14 percentage points, while 80 percent
said they expect sales will grow in the next six months, up from
66 percent in the third quarter. Businesses need to pick up
hiring to lower an unemployment rate that’s been at 9.5 percent
or higher for 16 straight months, the longest such stretch since
record-keeping began in 1948.  “Demand is returning as evidenced by anticipated sales
increases, and that is good news. When demand increases, capital
expenditures and employment follow, which is what we expect to
see in the next six months,”  Ivan G. Seidenberg , chairman of
the Business Roundtable and chief executive officer of New York-
based  Verizon Communications Inc. , said in a statement.  Fifty-nine percent of executives said they plan to spend
more on equipment, up from 49 percent, the survey showed.  The executives forecast U.S. economic growth of 2.5 percent
in 2011 after projecting 1.9 percent growth for 2010 in the
previous survey. That compares with the 2.6 percent median
estimate of economists for 2011 surveyed by Bloomberg News from
Dec. 2-8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
