Rabobank International  won a S$5.2
million ($4 million) award in a contract dispute with the
Singapore unit of  Motorola Inc. , a U.S. mobile phone maker.  The Singapore Court of Appeal overturned an earlier ruling
that said the bank wasn’t entitled to payments from Motorola,
according to a  decision  released publicly today.  Rabobank, based in the Netherlands, sued Motorola
Electronics Pte, claiming under its contracts it was entitled to
money  Jurong Technologies Industrial Corp.  owed Motorola. Jurong
is under judicial management, the equivalent of bankruptcy
protection.  Rabobank rejected an offer from Motorola to settle the case
a week before the appeal hearings started in January, according
to the ruling.  The case is Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank
BA vs. Motorola Electronics Pte CA52/2010 in the Singapore Court
of Appeal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
