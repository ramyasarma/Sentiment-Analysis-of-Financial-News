Canada’s index of  leading economic
indicators  rose for the second straight month in November, led
by increases in housing and stock prices.  The index rose 0.3 percent, matching the revised gain from
October, Ottawa-based Statistics Canada said today. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted the index would rise 0.5
percent, based on the median of nine estimates. The average
monthly increase over the past decade is 0.3 percent.  The index’s measure of housing starts and resales rose 2
percent, after six previous declines, and stock prices increased
2.8 percent, the report said.  The Bank of Canada kept its key lending rate at 1 percent
Dec. 7. Governor Mark Carney said yesterday that further
monetary policy tightening after three rate increases earlier
this year would be “carefully considered.”  Six of the index’s 10 components increased in November,
three were unchanged and one declined. New factory orders rose
0.7 percent and furniture and appliance sales were unchanged
after four previous declines. Business and personal services
employment fell 0.4 percent, Statistics Canada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
