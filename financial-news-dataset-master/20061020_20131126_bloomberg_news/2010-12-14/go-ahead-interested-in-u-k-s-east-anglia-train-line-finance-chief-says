Go-Ahead Group Plc will consider
bidding for the U.K.’s East Anglia railway franchise to build up
commuter-train  operations , Finance Director Nick Swift said.  Long-distance services “are not really what we do,” Swift
said today in an interview in London. “We prefer higher-
density, commuter-type of operations. East Anglia fits into that
category, so East Anglia would be of interest.”  National Express Group Plc’s East Anglia train-operating
 franchise  expires next year. U.K. Transport Secretary Philip
Hammond said on Dec. 7 that he may award a shortened contract
for the routes and then seek a longer-term agreement starting in
2013. Go-Ahead Group’s current rail franchises include the
Southern, Southeastern and London Midland lines.  Swift also said a U.K. antitrust probe of the country’s bus
industry is likely to be concluded in a few months. “We don’t
expect it to be too significant” because regulators will
probably find the market is competitive, “so we’re not
expecting anything too bad to come out of that,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
