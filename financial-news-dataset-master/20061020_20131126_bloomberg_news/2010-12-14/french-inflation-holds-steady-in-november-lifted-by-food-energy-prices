French inflation held steady in
November, suggesting companies are struggling to pass on higher
energy costs as the economy weakens.  Consumer prices, based on a harmonized European Union
method, rose 1.8 percent from a year earlier, the Paris-based
national statistics office  Insee  said today. That’s in line with
the median estimate of 10 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
In the month, prices rose 0.1 percent.  Rising oil prices are leaving French consumers with less
money to spend just as companies are seeking ways to cut costs.
French  industrial output  unexpectedly fell in October and wage
growth slowed in the third quarter. The European Commission said
last month the French economy will expand at a weaker pace than
the 16-member euro region this year.  “Inflation should reach its high for 2010 in December,”
said  Dominique Barbet , senior economist at BNP Paribas in Paris.
Still, service prices will be “restrained by the moderation in
wage growth,” he said.  Energy prices rose 0.9 percent from October and jumped 10
percent from a year earlier. Excluding food and energy costs,
consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in the year and fell 0.1
percent from October, Insee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
