The New Zealand earthquake that
damaged more than 100,000 homes in September may cause
insurance-industry losses of as much as $5.5 billion, according
to reinsurer  PartnerRe Ltd.   The cost may be at least $4.5 billion, the Bermuda-based
company said late yesterday in a statement. PartnerRe said its
losses from the quake, which severed water and sewage lines in
and around Christchurch, New Zealand’s second-largest city, will
range from $140 million to $160 million, more than twice the $64
million that the company projected on Nov. 3.  Cost estimates have been climbing as claims come in since
the Sept. 4 quake. Risk Management Solutions, which helps
insurers manage catastrophe risk, estimated total costs from the
quake of NZ$2.1 billion ($1.6 billion) to NZ$3.5 billion on
Sept. 15. New Zealand’s government said on Dec. 13 that the cost
would be NZ$5 billion, after more than 160,000 claims were
received by the state-owned disaster insurer.  Homeowners and businesses often postpone submitting claims
until “they begin to understand the level of damage they have
experienced,” said  Jayanta Guin , senior vice president at AIR
Worldwide, a catastrophe modeler, in an e-mail. The delay “is
consistent with other major events like the Chile earthquake of
2010 or the Northridge, California earthquake of 1994.”  AIR has estimated insured losses from the New Zealand quake
may be between NZ$2.7 billion and NZ$6 billion.  Hannover Re , Germany’s second-biggest reinsurer, estimated
the cost to insurers from the 7.1-magnitude quake would be $4
billion. Chief Executive Officer  Ulrich Wallin  said at a
conference in Monte Carlo on Sept. 13 that Hannover’s loss won’t
be a “three-digit million-euro figure.”  Chile, California  The quake that occurred in Chile this year may cost the
industry as much as $8 billion, according to catastrophe-
modelers AIR and Eqecat Inc. The most expensive earthquake in
U.S. history is the Northridge temblor that struck Los Angeles
in 1994, causing about $22 billion in insured damages in 2009
dollars, according to  data  compiled by Munich Re, the world’s
largest reinsurer  “In the case of Northridge, it took several years before
all the insurance losses were tallied,” Guin said.  PartnerRe fell $1.57, or 2 percent, to $77.87 at 4:03 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company has
advanced about 4.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
