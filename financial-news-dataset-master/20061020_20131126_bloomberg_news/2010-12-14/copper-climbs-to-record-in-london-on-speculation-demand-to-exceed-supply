Copper climbed to a record in London
and rose to a 31-month high in New York on expectation demand
will outpace supply as the global economy extends a recovery,
and as investors sought alternatives to a weakening U.S. dollar.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.4 percent to $9,259.75 a metric ton,
surpassing the previous peak of $9,248 a ton yesterday.  Futures on the Comex in New York climbed as much as 0.5
percent to $4.2260 a pound, the highest level since May 2008,
when they touched a record $4.6206.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
