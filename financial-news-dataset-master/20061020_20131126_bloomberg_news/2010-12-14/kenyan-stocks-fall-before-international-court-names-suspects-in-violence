Kenyan shares fell for a second day
ahead of an announcement tomorrow by the  International Criminal
Court  in which six of the main suspects alleged to have been
involved in post-election violence in 2008 will be identified.  The 55-member  Nairobi Stock Exchange’s All-Share Index 
declined as much as 0.7 percent to 78.25 points and was at 78.34
points at 2:22 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital. A close at that
level would be the lowest since Dec. 7.  “There is a sense that the political risk factors have
spiked,”  Aly Khan Satchu , a Nairobi-based independent stock
market analyst, said in a phone interview. “There is a little
bit of nervousness about tomorrow’s announcement.”  Ocampo said earlier this month he will file cases against
six Kenyans for committing crime against humanity during the two
months of ethnic clashes that followed a disputed presidential
election in December 2007. As many as 1,500 people were killed
and 300,000 others displaced in the fighting.  Among the top 10 losing stocks were four lenders, including
 Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the biggest by market value,
 Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd. , the second-largest by market
value,  National Bank of Kenya Ltd. , a state-owned lender and  NIC
Bank Ltd.   “A lot of the froth is being taken off the top performers
in the banking sector,” Satchu said. “Investors are of the view
they are better off bagging the gains instead of waiting for the
full-year performance,” announcements next year, he said.  Lenders in  Kenya  have posted higher profit this year amid
accelerating economic growth after the central bank slashed
interest rates to a record low to boost credit extension to
businesses and households.  Barclays dropped 1 shilling, or 1.7 percent to 59
shillings; Standard Chartered declined 6 shillings, or 2.3
percent, to 250 shillings; National Bank lost 50 cents, or 1.3
percent, to 37.5 shillings; and NIC Bank fell 50 cents, or 1
percent, to 48 shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
