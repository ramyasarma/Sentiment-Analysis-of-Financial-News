Copper dropped for the first time in
three days as some investors sold the metal to lock in gains
following its climb to an all-time high. Zinc, tin, aluminum and
nickel advanced.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell as
much as 0.6 percent to $9,166.75 a metric ton, and traded at
$9,222 at 2:25 p.m. in Singapore. The contract reached a record
$9,248 a ton yesterday after China refrained from raising
interest rates, boosting the demand outlook in the biggest user.  “The potential for tightening in China will continue to
hang over investors’ heads but everything the government has
done so far has had little effect,” said Li Yaozhong, head of
metals research at Yongan Futures Co. “We’ll get a little bit
of profit-taking along the way but the uptrend remains intact.”  Copper surged yesterday after China, which on Dec. 10
raised reserve-requirement ratios for banks by half a percentage
point, didn’t raise borrowing costs even as inflation jumped by
the fastest pace in more than two years. The metal has gained 25
percent this year on stronger demand and declining stockpiles.  “The fundamentals are looking good, especially for
copper,” Li said from Beijing. Until the Chinese government
takes additional steps or “statistics start showing some
slowdown, we’re going to see commodity prices move higher.”  The metal for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange traded 0.5 percent higher at 69,090 yuan ($10,379) a
ton, after gaining as much as 1 percent earlier. Futures on the
Comex in New York dropped as much as 0.5 percent to $4.1850 a
pound, after climbing to a 31-month high of $4.2225 yesterday.  Higher Prices  “It’s probably going to be $5 a pound in a year’s time,”
 John Stephenson , a fund manager at First Asset Investment
Management Inc., said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It
continues to be the most important industrial base metal and it
will continue to be in demand, and there’s really no supply
coming on till 2012, 2013 in an appreciable way. So I think it
will be very tight in 2011, I think prices will continue to go
higher.”  Aurubis AG, Europe’s largest copper smelter, said the
“positive trend” in 2010 will continue in 2011, with copper
demand growing further, “borne along by the global economic
recovery.”  “In light of the expected high copper price, we believe
global mining output will pick up further,” the company said in
an e-mailed statement today. “This should lead to improved
availability of copper concentrates in the medium term due to
newly opened copper mines and thus a recovery of the treatment
and refining charges.”  The fees to turn copper concentrate from mines into refined
metal may rise for 2011 contracts to at least $60 a ton for
treatment and 6 cents a pound for refining, compared with 2010
contract rates of $46.50 a ton for treatment and 4.65 cents a
pound, according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  Aluminum in London rose 0.7 percent to $2,348 a ton, zinc
gained 1 percent to $2,345 a ton and lead increased 0.6 percent
to $2,454 a ton. Nickel climbed 0.5 percent to $24,660 a ton,
and tin advanced 0.7 percent to $26,330 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
