Egypt will start a 140-megawatt
combined-cycle power plant in February that will be the North
African nation’s first facility to use solar energy, a spokesman
at the Electricity and Energy Ministry said.  “As soon as we have confirmed that all parts are working
properly in harmony, the plant will start operations,” Aktham
Abou El-Ella said today by phone from Cairo.  The plant in Kuraymat, an uninhabited flat desert area
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Cairo, will have a
solar capacity of 20 megawatts. The facility will also include
turbines that run on natural gas and steam, according to the
website of the ministry’s  New and Renewable Energy Authority .  Egypt, the most populous Arab country, plans to generate 20
percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, including
12 percent from wind power, according to the ministry. The
country’s generating capacity reached 22,750 megawatts in the
fiscal year ended in June.  The Ministry signed an engineering, procurement and
construction contract with Iberdrola SA of Spain in 2007,
according to the ministry’s  website . Cairo-based  Orascom
Construction Industries  is doing the construction work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
