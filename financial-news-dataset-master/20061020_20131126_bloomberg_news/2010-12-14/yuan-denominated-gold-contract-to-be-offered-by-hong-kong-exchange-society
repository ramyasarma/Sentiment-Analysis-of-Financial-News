The  Chinese Gold & Exchange Society ,
Hong Kong’s only bourse for spot precious metals, said it will
introduce a yuan-denominated gold contract next year.  The contract size will be 1 kilogram, with a minimum purity
of 99.95 percent, the exchange said today in an e-mailed reply
to questions from Bloomberg News. The Financial Times reported
the exchange’s plans earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
