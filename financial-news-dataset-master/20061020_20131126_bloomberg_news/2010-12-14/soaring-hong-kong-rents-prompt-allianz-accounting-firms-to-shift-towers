Surging office  rents  in Hong Kong
are prompting firms including  Allianz Global Investors  to shift
out of the city’s most expensive towers as competition for prime
space heats up along with the region’s growth.  Prime office rents in the Central business district soared
34 percent in the six months ended September from a year
earlier, the biggest gain worldwide, according to property
broker  CB Richard Ellis Group Inc.  Office rents in the area may
climb as much as 30 percent next year, said  Gavin Morgan , head
of markets at  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.   Top-tier buildings such as  Cheung Kong Center  and
 International Finance Centre  have raised rents as banks
including  HSBC Holdings Plc  and Barclays Plc expand after the
financial crisis. The city now has the world’s most expensive
occupancy costs after London’s West End. Shares of Hong Kong
landlords have outperformed the main  property index  on the
city’s stock exchange this year.  Tenants in Central “are reassessing whether it’s still
within their budget to stay in the district,” said  Simon Lo ,
Hong Kong-based director of research and advisory at  Colliers
International . Some tenants such as professional services or
consulting firms “have a much lower threshold for rents,” he
said.  Moving Out  Cheung Kong Center, the 12-year-old office building owned
by  Li Ka-shing , Hong Kong’s richest man, may see as many as five
tenants move out by the end of 2011, according to people with
knowledge of the matter.  The IFC towers I and II, both owned by  Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd.  and  Henderson Land Development Co. , are seeing
at least three tenants depart this year and next.  Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd. ’s Exchange Square complex will
lose another tenant to Sun Hung Kai’s International Commerce
Centre in West Kowloon, across Victoria Harbour, following moves
by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG.  Allianz Global, the investment unit of  Allianz SE , Europe’s
largest insurer, which occupies about 20,500 square feet in
Cheung Kong Center, will shift to nearby Citibank Plaza,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter. McKinsey
& Co. is also looking at moving, according to two people.  Patience Chan, a spokeswoman for Allianz in Hong Kong,
declined to comment, as did Glenn Leibowitz, a Shanghai-based
McKinsey spokesman.  Laura Cheung , a spokeswoman for  Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. , which owns and operates Cheung Kong Center,
declined to comment on its tenants.  Hutchison  is 49.9 percent-
owned by Li’s developer  Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd .  Attracting New Tenants  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose current lease for its
85,000 square feet of space expires in November 2011, is in
discussion with Cheung Kong Center’s building management about a
possible renewal, Joanne Oswin, a Hong Kong-based operation
partner at the accounting firm, said in an interview.  Even with such departures, Cheung Kong Center won’t have
problems attracting new tenants, said  John Siu , general manager
for southern China at real estate services firm Cushman &
Wakefield Ltd. in Hong Kong. Barclays, the U.K.’s third-largest
bank, moved into the building earlier this year.  “It is one of the few top-tier office buildings in Hong
Kong and many companies believe that being there gives you a
sense of prestige and market influence,” said Siu.  Change in Profile  Cheung Kong Center, built on the site of the former Hilton
hotel, charges its new tenants between HK$140 ($18) and HK$150 a
square foot per month on average, according to Seattle-based
Colliers and Cushman & Wakefield of New York. The average rent
in Citibank Plaza, owned by  Champion REIT , is HK$110 per square
foot and in  Swire Pacific Ltd. ’s Pacific Place in Admiralty
district from HK$95 to HK$100, according to Colliers.  “We’re seeing a change in the profile of tenants in
Central’s top office buildings,” said Jones Lang LaSalle’s
Morgan, who is based in Hong Kong. “Many of the support
departments in the big banks or professional firms providing
these services to them are moving their operations away to non-
core districts.”  Singapore-listed Hongkong Land, the biggest landlord in
Central, has  jumped  39 percent this year, outpacing the 6
percent gain in the Hang Seng Property Index which tracks Hong
Kong’s seven biggest builders that doesn’t include the company.  Swire, Wharf  Swire, which also owns the Taikoo Place office complex in
Hong Kong’s Island East district, has  gained  34 percent this
year, and Wharf Holdings Ltd., owner of the Times Square and
Harbour City commercial complexes, climbed 25 percent.  Accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP is moving its entire
local operation, now in IFC II and Li’s Hutchison House, to
Citic Tower in Admiralty, adjacent to Central, next year,
according to spokeswoman  Queenie Yuen . The firm has agreed to
take up nine floors at the tower, owned and run by  Citic Pacific
Ltd. , an arm of China’s biggest state-owned investment company.  ING Groep NV , the biggest Dutch financial-services company,
in October moved its investment management and insurance units
to the ICC from IFC I, said spokeswoman Jessie Hsieh. London
Stock Exchange Group Plc in July moved its Hong Kong office from
IFC II to ICC.  Rents in IFC II, Hong Kong’s second-tallest skyscraper
after the ICC, and IFC I, are about HK$140 per square foot,
according to Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle, the second-
largest publicly traded commercial property broker. Rents at ICC
are about HK$55 and may rise as much as 30 percent over the next
two years, according to property consultant Knight Frank LLP.  More Departures  Simmons & Simmons , a London-based law firm, will move out
of its 21,000 square-foot space on the 35th floor of Cheung Kong
Center in May for Pacific Place, Paul Li, Simmons & Simmons’s
China head, said in a phone interview.  Deutsche Bank AG will complete its relocation to the ICC
from Cheung Kong Center this year, said Singapore-based
spokesman  Mark Bennewith . Bloomberg LP, the parent company of
Bloomberg News, is a tenant in Cheung Kong Center.  “The reason why we haven’t heard new tenants moving in yet
is because some of the ones that are moving out still have a few
months to a year in their contract and landlords won’t normally
need to rush to sign up new tenants,” said Cushman &
Wakefield’s Siu.  That space will probably be filled by separate small
offices of hedge funds or investment banks, he said.  Gateway to China  Occupancy costs, which include rent, taxes and service
fees, were $184.21 a square foot a year in Central, compared
with $193.69 in London’s West End, according to a report from
Los Angeles-based CB Richard Ellis, the world’s largest
commercial property broker.  Hong Kong’s government raised this year’s growth forecast
to 6.5 percent as the city, a gateway to China, benefits from
growth on the mainland.  The jobless rate fell to 4.2 percent for the three months
ended Oct. 31, the lowest level in 20 months. The city’s number
of financial professionals rose to a record 37,694 by July,
eclipsing the previous high reached in November 2008, the
Securities and Futures Commission said in August.  PwC, which also has offices at the Edinburgh Tower and
Prince’s Building in Central, leased about 100,000 square feet
of office space in 2008 at the Manulife Financial Centre in the
Kowloon East district. Rents in that district, a 30-minute
subway ride from Central, are currently between HK$20 and HK$30
a square foot, said Colliers’ Lo.  Professional services’ firms “are going to be reviewing
their cost base as a result of rising rents in Central,” said
 Rhodri James , Hong Kong-based executive director of office
services at  CB Richard Ellis . “Some of them will be moving all
or part of their operations to more cost-efficient buildings
outside the area.”
