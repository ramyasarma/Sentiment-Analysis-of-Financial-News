Lesotho will begin construction next
year of an $87 million wind farm, the first in the mountainous
African kingdom, which will add as much as 30 megawatts to the
nation’s electricity grid.  An environmental impact assessment is under way and the
facility is due to be fully operational before the end of 2012,
Lehlohonolo Khoboko, a consultant to the builders, said in a
phone interview from the capital, Maseru, today.  South Africa’s Netgroup and its local partner Powerdev
signed an agreement with Lesotho’s government to build the plant
in October. It will be situated at Letseng-La-Terai in the
Mokhotlong district, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of the
capital, and will boost the country’s electricity output to more
than 90 megawatts, said Khoboko.  The country currently produces 72 megawatts at the Muela
hydropower plant, which is due to reach a full capacity of 110
megawatts when the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water
Project is completed in 2017.  “This is an exciting project and it brings with it huge
technological challenges for Lesotho,” said Khoboko.  The original plan had called for the windmill stems to be
80 meters (260 feet) tall, and were reduced to 60 meters because
the country’s roads have too many hairpin bends to transport
anything bigger, he said.  In addition to Letseng, Sani Pass and Masetise in Quthing,
280 kilometers south of Maseru, have also been identified as
potential sites for wind farms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
