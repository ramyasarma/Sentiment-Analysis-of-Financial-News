Yahoo! Inc. , owner of the largest
Web portal in the U.S., plans to eliminate about 650 jobs, or 5
percent of its  workforce , part of its two-year-old turnaround
effort, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The company is set to make the cuts as early as today, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter
hasn’t been made public.  Chief Executive Officer  Carol Bartz , who joined  Yahoo  in
January 2009, made a larger round of cuts last year, in addition
to shutting underperforming websites. The company has struggled
to stanch a migration of users and advertising dollars to
Facebook Inc., which Yahoo now sees as its biggest rival.
Facebook passed Yahoo as the top seller of online display ads in
the U.S. a year ago, based on the number of times an ad is
viewed, according to Reston, Virginia-based ComScore Inc.  Yahoo  fell 7 cents to $16.63 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock is little changed in
value this year.  Kim Rubey , a spokeswoman for Sunnyvale, California-based
Yahoo, declined to comment.  Yahoo’s job cuts were previously reported by the All Things
Digital and TechCrunch blogs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
