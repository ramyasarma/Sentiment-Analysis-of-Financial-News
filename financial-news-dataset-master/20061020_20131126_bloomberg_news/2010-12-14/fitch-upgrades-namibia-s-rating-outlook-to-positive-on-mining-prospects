Fitch Ratings Ltd. revised Namibia’s
outlook on its ratings to positive from stable because of the
resilience to the global economic recession and “strong
prospects” for the mining sector, the agency said.  Uranium output is expected to quadruple by 2015, London-
based Fitch said in a statement e-mailed late yesterday. The
southern African country is the fourth largest producer of the
metal, which is processed into fuel for nuclear power plants.
Fitch rates Namibia’s long-term foreign debt at BBB-.  “The immense growth of the uranium sector will strengthen
Namibia’s credit fundamentals,”  Veronica Kalema , director in
Fitch’s sovereign group, said.  Uranium rebounded to the highest in more than two years as
Asian utilities secure material for the next decade and China
builds stockpiles, according to Macquarie Bank Ltd. Asia may
operate 300 nuclear power reactors by 2030, up from 115 units
today, inspection and certification agency Lloyd’s Register
Group said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
