At least three people died and seven
were wounded in pre-dawn fighting in the south of the  Somali 
capital, Mogadishu, between pro-government forces and rebel
fighters.  The clashes erupted after fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked
al-Shabaab militia and the Hisbul Islam group attacked
government bases in the south of the city.  “The peace haters attacked early this morning at around
6.00 a.m.,” Colonel Hassan Musse, a government army commander,
said in a phone interview today. “We shelled them in their
entrenchments as soon they began firing rocket-propelled
grenades.”  Those killed and injured in the violence sustained shrapnel
and bullet wounds, Ali Muse Sheikh, director of Mogadishu’s
ambulance service, said in a phone interview.  Rebel fighters from groups including al-Shabaab, the
militia that the U.S. accuses of having links to al-Qaeda, have
been fighting the Somali government for the past three years.
Most of southern and central Somalia has been seized by the
insurgents, while President  Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed’ s
government controls only parts of Mogadishu.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ouster of former dictator  Mohamed Siad Barre  in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
