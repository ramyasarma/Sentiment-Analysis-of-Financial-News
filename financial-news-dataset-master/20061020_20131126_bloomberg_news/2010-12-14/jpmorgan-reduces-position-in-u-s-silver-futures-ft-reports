JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced a large
position in the U.S. silver futures market, the Financial Times
said, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.  The decision was made to try to deflect public criticism of
its dealings in silver, the FT said. The bank’s silver positions
would from now on be “materially smaller” than in the past,
according to the paper. Two calls and an e-mail to  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a New York-based spokeswoman at JPMorgan, were not
immediately answered outside of office hours.  Comex silver surged 77 percent this year, extending the 49
percent rally in 2009. Prices climbed to a 30-year high of
$30.75 an ounce on Dec. 7 as investors sought precious metals as
a store of value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
