Shares outstanding in the  iShares
Gold Trust , the fourth-largest exchange-traded fund backed by
bullion, jumped the most in more than four years yesterday.  The number of  shares held  rose by 27 million, or 7.6
percent, to 383,550,000, the biggest gain since February 2006,
according to Bloomberg data. About 28 million shares changed
hands yesterday in a single block transaction that was equal to
more than 90 percent of the day’s volume. The trade, which
occurred at 1:41 p.m. in New York at $13.6762 a share, was worth
about $383 million.  Soros Fund Management, which according to Soro’s website
manages about $27 billion, added a stake in the iShares Gold
Trust in the third quarter after cutting its holding in the SPDR
Gold Trust, the biggest fund backed by bullion. Investors have
accumulated record amounts of the precious metal this year,
sending assets in global exchange-traded products up 17 percent,
data from 10 providers show.  Shares outstanding of the SPDR Gold Trust were unchanged
yesterday at 424,700,000. Yesterday at 1:40 p.m., about 2.8
million shares of SPDR Gold Trust were traded in a single block
transaction that was equal to more than 20 percent of the day’s
volume.  Gold futures, which touched a record $1,432.50 an ounce on
Dec. 7, rose $6.30, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $1,404.30 an
ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The metal, up 28
percent this year, is headed for the 10th straight annual gain.  Lance Berg , a spokesman for the iShares fund, and Natalie
Zarechnak, a spokeswoman for the SPDR fund, declined to comment
