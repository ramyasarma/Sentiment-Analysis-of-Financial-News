“The King’s Speech,” a film about
efforts by Britain’s George VI to overcome his stutter, led
Golden Globe nominations with seven, including one for  Colin Firth  as best actor.  “The Fighter,” a drama about Irish-American boxer Micky
Ward, and “The Social Network,” the fictionalized story of the
founding of Facebook Inc., received six nominations each, the
Hollywood Foreign Press Association said today during a press
conference in Beverly Hills, California.  Nominations often signal likely candidates for Academy
Awards, Hollywood’s top honor, and the publicity they generate
can lift box-office and DVD sales. Ticket revenue in the U.S.
and Canada may surpass last year’s record $10.6 billion,
according to Los Angeles-based Hollywood.com Box-Office.  “They have agreed two-thirds of the time on best picture
for the past 30 years,”  Tom O’Neil , author of the book “Movie
Awards,” said in an interview.  The organizations last chose the same best picture in 2009,
when director  Danny Boyle ’s “Slumdog Millionaire” won both.
The Oscar nominations for 2010 films will be announced Jan. 25.  Sony Pictures received the most nominations of any studio
with 14, including “The Social Network.” Weinstein Co.,
distributor of “The King’s Speech,” had 10 nominations. Fox
Searchlight, owned by  News Corp ., and Viacom Inc.’s Paramount
Pictures, each received seven. Relativity Media LLC, the film
finance and production company controlled by  Ryan Kavanaugh , and
 Walt Disney Co.  had six apiece.  “The King’s Speech” stars Firth as George VI, who turns
to an eccentric speech therapist, played by  Geoffrey Rush , to
overcome his stammer. Rush and  Helen Bonham Carter  received
nominations for their supporting roles.  Best Dramas  Other best-drama nominees include “The Fighter,” “The
Social Network,” “Black Swan” and “Inception.”  In the best musical or comedy category, “Alice in
Wonderland,” “Burlesque,” “The Kids Are All Right,” “Red”
and “The Tourist” will compete for the Golden Globe.  The 68th Annual Golden Globe Awards show, to be hosted by
comedian  Ricky Gervais , will be broadcast live on NBC starting
at 8 p.m. New York time on Jan. 16. The nominations for 25
categories were read today by actors Josh Duhamel,  Katie Holmes 
and  Blair Underwood  during a televised news conference.  The Oscar telecast, to be hosted by James Franco and  Anne Hathaway , will be shown Feb. 27 on Walt Disney Co.’s ABC.  Golden Globe Nominees  BEST MOTION PICTURE - DRAMA  Black Swan - Fox Searchlight Pictures
