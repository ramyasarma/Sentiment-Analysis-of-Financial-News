Spain sold 2.5 billion euros ($3.4
billion) of Treasury bills, below the maximum target for the
auction, as contagion from Ireland’s bailout prompted a surge in
the country’s borrowing costs.  The Treasury sold 1.99 billion euros of 12-month bills and
523 million euros of 18-month bills, the Bank of Spain in Madrid
said today. The average yield on the 12-month bills was 3.449
percent, compared with 2.363 percent when similar-maturity
securities were sold on Nov. 16, and the 18-month paper yielded
3.721 percent, up from 2.664 percent in November. The Treasury
set a maximum target of 3 billion euros for the auction.  The  gap  between Spanish and German bond yields surged on
Nov. 30 to the widest since the start of the euro amid
speculation Spain may follow Ireland into a European Union
bailout. Faced with higher debt costs, Finance Minister Elena
Salgado said on Nov. 26 the Treasury will issue less debt than
planned at the last auctions set for the year, including bond
sales on Dec. 16, as the state has met its 2010 financing needs.  “The big story is going to be Thursday,” said  Gianluca Salford , a fixed-income strategist at JP Morgan in London. “All
the other peripheral countries have been out of the market for
December, liquidity is poor, final demand is poor, so
technically the situation for Spain is bad,” even as falling
prices may mean the bonds perform better after the next sale.  Bond Purchases  Spanish bonds continued to decline on the secondary market
after the sale, with the 10-year bond yield rising to 5.53
percent. The spread widened to 256.2 basis points, compared with
247.7 basis points yesterday and an average of 15 basis points
for the first decade of monetary union. The gap reached a euro-
era intraday record of 298 basis points on Nov. 30. The euro
strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.3436.  The European Central Bank increased its bond purchases last
week as part of its package of measures aimed at easing the
sovereign debt crisis. The Frankfurt-based ECB said it completed
2.667 billion euros of purchases, the most in 23 weeks, after
settling 1.965 billion euros the previous week. The bank hasn’t
said which countries’ securities it is buying.  As the sovereign-debt crisis spreads from Ireland to Spain,
Portugal and Italy, European leaders meet in Brussels on Dec. 16
and Dec. 17. On the agenda are discussions about the creation of
a permanent rescue mechanism to replace the existing bailout
fund that expires in 2013.  Spain has repeatedly said it doesn’t need external help and
is making banks and regional governments provide investors with
additional data in an attempt to disprove suspicions about the
country’s fiscal and financial health.  Banks will start publishing additional information about
their real-estate exposure and wholesale funding next year. This
is necessary as “the perception of reality is much worse than
reality itself,” Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez
Ordonez said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
