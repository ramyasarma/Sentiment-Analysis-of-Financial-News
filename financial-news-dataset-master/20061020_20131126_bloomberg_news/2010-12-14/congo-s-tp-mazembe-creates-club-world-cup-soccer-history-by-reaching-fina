TP Mazembe Englebert became the
first African team to reach the final of FIFA’s  Club World Cup 
by beating Brazil’s Sport Club Internacional 2-0 in Abu Dhabi.  Second-half goals from Mulota Kubangu and Dioko Kaluyituka
last night lifted the  Congolese team  into the Dec. 18
championship match against European champion Inter Milan or
Asian Champions League winner Seongnam Ilhwa of South Korea.  By beating 2006 Club World Cup champion Internacional, TP
Mazembe became the first team from outside Europe and South
America to reach the final of the 10-year-old event contested by
the champions of the continental soccer confederations.  “It was time for Africa to reach the final and
unfortunately it has been at our expense,” Internacional coach
Celso Roth told the tournament website.  “There’s no dishonor
in that, African football is improving all the time and I don’t
see anything shameful in losing to an African team.”  European clubs have won the past three editions after
Brazilian teams took the title in 2000, 2005 and 2006.  Rafael Benitez ’s Inter Milan faces Seongnam Ilhwa in the
other semifinal today. European teams have won all three
previous meetings with Asian clubs at the tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
