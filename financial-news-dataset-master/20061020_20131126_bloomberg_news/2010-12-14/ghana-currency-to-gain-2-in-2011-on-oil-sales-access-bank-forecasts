Ghana’s currency, the cedi, will
gain 2 percent against the dollar in 2011 after the West African
nation starts exporting oil,  Access Bank Plc  forecast.  “Next year I’m seeing it around 1.44 after oil sales
begin,” Kwabena Owusu, a trader with the Accra office of Access
Bank, said in a phone interview today.  Ghana is due to begin pumping oil from its offshore Jubilee
field tomorrow.  The cedi was trading at 1.4680 to the dollar at 1:44 p.m.
Accra time, down 0.2 percent since 9:02 a.m., according to
Access Bank and Bloomberg data. Demand for dollars to finance
oil and gas imports ahead of Jubilee production continued to put
pressure on the cedi, he said.  Speculation that the Bank of Ghana may sell dollars
tomorrow at a rate below 1.44 to the dollar hadn’t eased
pressure on the cedi, Owusu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
