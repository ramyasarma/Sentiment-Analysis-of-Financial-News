Three pregnant lawmakers whose votes
could be decisive in today’s no confidence against Italian Prime
Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said they will cast their vote in the
Parliament’s lower house, newswire Ansa reported.  The three deputies, including  Federica Mogherini , 37, who
was due to deliver her child yesterday, are likely to vote
against Berlusconi, ANSA added.  “I’ll be there unless my water breaks,” Mogherini, a
Berlusconi opponent, was quoted as saying.   To contact the reporter on this story:
