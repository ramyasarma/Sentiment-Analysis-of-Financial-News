Corn fell from a one-month high on
speculation that demand for the grain used in livestock feed may
decline because of increasing supplies of lower-quality wheat.  Wet weather may result in 60 percent of the wheat crop in
three Australian states being classified as feed quality,
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said on Dec. 10. As
much as 30 percent of the country’s estimated 14.3 million
metric tons of exports may be for feed, said  Wayne Gordon , an
analyst at Rabobank International in Sydney.  “U.S. corn-export sales could slow as Asian feed producers
buy more Australian wheat,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice
president at Price Futures Group Inc. in Chicago. “Export
demand is a little slow” after prices rose, Scoville said.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 1.25 cents, or 0.2
percent, to close at $5.8725 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $5.89,
matching the highest for a most-active contract since Nov. 10.  The commodity has climbed 57 percent since the end of June
as adverse weather reduced U.S. production.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
