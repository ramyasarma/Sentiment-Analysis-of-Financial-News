RWE AG shelved its 65 megawatt
biomass-fed power station at Stallingborough, England, while the
company reviews its investment program amid changes to Germany’s
energy policy, the company said today.  “RWE is currently reviewing its medium-term plan which
includes the investment programme,” Steve Thomas, a Swindon-
based spokesman, said by e-mail. As part of that, RWE has put
the Stallingborough project on hold and will report on the
review in Spring 2011, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
