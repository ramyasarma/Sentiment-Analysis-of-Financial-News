Bharti Airtel Ltd.  plans to expand
its mobile network coverage in Madagascar by about 25 percent in
2011 to attract customers in rural areas, Heiko Schlittke, the
company’s director in the country, said.  The expansion will offer services to a further 5 million to
6 million people, Schlittke said yesterday in an interview in
Antananarivo, the capital. The company plans to invest $50
million over 18 months and wants to increase customers to 3.2
million in Madagascar within a year from 2 million now, he said.  “Competition is centered on the big cities but we believe
the country is still under-serviced in terms of communication,
and the biggest opportunity for growth is in rural areas,”
Schlittke said.  Orange SA is Bharti Airtel’s main competition in the Indian
Ocean island nation of about 20 million people, he said. New
Delhi-based Bharti bought most of Zain’s assets in Africa for $9
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
