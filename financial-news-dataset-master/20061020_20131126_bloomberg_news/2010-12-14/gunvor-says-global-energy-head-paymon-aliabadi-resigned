Paymon Aliabadi , who led Gunvor
International BV’s expansion outside of oil markets, has left
the Amsterdam-based company.  He left for personal reasons, a company official said by
telephone. The official declined to provide further details and
asked not to be named in line with company policy.  Aliabadi was based in Gunvor’s main office in Geneva, where
he oversaw the expansion into electricity, natural gas, coal,
freight and emissions this year. Gunvor handles about a third of
Russia’s seaborne oil exports.  Aliabadi joined Gunvor in 2009 from Essent Trading
International, where he was managing director. He previously was
vice president of energy commodities at Sempra Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
