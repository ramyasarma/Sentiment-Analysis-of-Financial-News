Volkswagen AG ’s Audi luxury unit
said China will replace Germany as its biggest market in 2011
“at the latest” as sales in the country boom, Audi Chief
Financial Officer  Axel Strotbek .  Audi aims to deliver one million vehicles in China, where
it outsells rivals  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and  Daimler AG ’s
Mercedes-Benz, over the next three years, Strotbek told
reporters in Munich yesterday. The Ingolstadt, Germany-based
carmaker’s sales in Germany and China in 2010 are neck-and-neck.  “I think we’ll see growth of about 8 percent,” Strotbek
said of the Chinese economy. Chinese car sales have historically
outpaced GDP growth, the China Automobile Industry Association
said last week.  Audi, whose eleven-month Chinese sales surged 50 percent to
209,800, will invest 11.6 billion euros ($15.6 billion)
worldwide outside of China on new products, plants and
technologies over the next five years, Strotbek said. The
booming Chinese market will help Audi reach another year of
record sales in 2011, he said.  The carmaker is targeting worldwide deliveries of more than
1.08 million units in 2010, a rise of 14 percent from 2009.
Eleven-month sales climbed 15 percent to 1 million vehicles,
surpassing Audi’s full-year sales record set in 2008.  Audi aims to sell 30,000 of the new A1 compact this year of
the 50,000 the carmaker is producing, Strotbek said.  “The orders for the car are higher than expected,” the
CFO said. “Our goal is to sell 100,000 cars in 2011” when the
A1, introduced in September, will be expanded to markets
globally except for China and the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
