LontohCoal Ltd. , the closely-held
South African coal mining company, has hired Samsung Securities
Asia Ltd. as lead manager of its initial public offering in Hong
Kong, Chief Executive Officer  Tshepo Kgadima  said.  The energy producer with thermal and steel-making coal
assets in South Africa and Zimbabwe plans to raise as much as
$500 million selling shares in Hong Kong and may list in the
first half of next year, Kgadima said in an interview on
Bloomberg TV today.  “We have been talking to a number of private equity funds
as well as sovereign wealth funds,” he said in Hong Kong.  The proceeds from the share sale will be used to develop
LontohCoal’s mines in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo
provinces, as well the Lubimbi coal fields in Zimbabwe, where
production is expected to start next year, the CEO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
