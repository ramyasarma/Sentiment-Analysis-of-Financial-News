Fiat SpA , the Italian carmaker which
runs Chrysler Group LLC, will invest 3 billion reais ($1.77
billion) to build a car factory in Brazil as it seeks to boost
sales in the company’s second-biggest market.  “Brazil, where we expect to sell more than 1 million cars
per year by 2014, is strategic to our expansion,” Chief
Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said in a statement today.
The new plant in the state of Pernambuco will have annual
production capacity of 200,000 units and will make vehicles for
Latin American markets, Fiat said.  Brazil accounted for 18 percent of Fiat’s 50 billion euros
($66.9 billion) in revenue in 2009, more than any country except
Italy. Fiat is focusing on emerging markets such as Brazil to
increase revenue and counter a slump in European sales.  Fiat aims to increase Brazilian vehicle deliveries to more
than 1 million in 2014 from 737,000 in 2009, with average annual
growth of 6.5 percent, the Italian company said in April. Fiat
had 22.7 percent of the Brazil car market last month, down from
25 percent a year earlier, according to the National Vehicle
Manufacturer’s Association in Sao Paulo.  “We expect a positive contribution from Brazil, a market
which is growing healthily,” Fiat sales chief  Andrea Formica 
said Dec. 2, commenting on the outlook for next year.  Uno Compact  Fiat started selling its new Uno compact in Brazil during
the second quarter. It delivered 63,400 of the cars through the
end of September, the automaker said in October.  Fiat  in October led a seventh consecutive monthly drop in
European car sales. The carmaker’s deliveries in the region
plunged 33 percent in October, according to the European
Automobile Manufacturers Association.  The investment announced today is part of a 10 billion-
reais plan for Brazil through 2014. The new plant may create as
many as 3,500 jobs, Fiat said.  Fiat, which acquired a 20 percent stake in Auburn Hills,
Michigan-based Chrysler last year, has said it will raise the
holding to 35 percent by the end of next year. Marchionne plans
to take the U.S. automaker public in the second half of 2011.  The Italian carmaker is spinning off truck and tractor
divisions to focus on carmaking. The carving out of operations
including Iveco and  CNH Global NV  into Fiat Industrial SpA will
give Marchionne two entities to facilitate future alliances.  Fiat Industrial’s shares are scheduled to begin trading in
Milan Jan. 3. The Italian Stock Exchange approved the listing
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
