Resource Capital Funds  and the
Australian tax office agreed to resolve a court dispute, less
than two weeks after the Denver-based private-equity firm
criticized the authority’s handling of the case.  The  Australian Taxation Office  and Resource Capital Fund
III LP, one of the buyout firm’s funds, “reached agreement to
resolve the outstanding issues relating to the current
proceedings,” they said in a joint statement e-mailed today.
They didn’t say whether the deal included a financial settlement.  The Australian newspaper  said  Dec. 4 that the tax office
had frozen Resource Capital’s local assets, alleging its
offshore structure may allow it to avoid taxes. The ATO was
seeking A$43 million ($42.8 million) in tax, penalties and
interest, the newspaper said, citing court documents in Perth,
Western Australia.  Resource Capital, which invests exclusively in mining, said
this month that its structure complied with Australian tax rules,
calling the ATO’s conduct “unfortunate.” The firm said it
would have held “full and open” talks with authorities if they
had made contact before the court proceedings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
