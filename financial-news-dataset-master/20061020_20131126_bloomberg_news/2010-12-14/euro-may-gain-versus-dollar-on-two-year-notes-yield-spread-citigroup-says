The euro may gain versus the dollar
as Federal Reserve Treasury purchases widen the yield spread
between German and U.S. two-year notes, Citigroup Inc. said  “With the European Central Bank still perceived as more
hawkish than the Fed, euro-dollar should continue to receive
cyclical underpinning by the two-year rate differential,”
 Valentin Marinov , a currency strategist at Citigroup in London,
wrote in a report today. “There may be indications by the Fed
that it could accelerate its bond purchases going forward if the
upside pressures on the Treasury yields persevere.”  The euro gained 0.1 percent to $1.3401 as of 2:21 p.m. in
London, leaving it up 1.3 percent over the past two days.  Germany’s two-year government note yielded 46 basis points
more than the similar maturity U.S. security, down from 48 basis
points yesterday, which was the most since Nov. 22, based on
closing prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
