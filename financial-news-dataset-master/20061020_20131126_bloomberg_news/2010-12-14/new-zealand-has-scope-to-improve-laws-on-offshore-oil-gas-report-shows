New Zealand’s offshore petroleum
operations would benefit from improvements to laws covering
health, safety and the environment, a report prepared for the
government shows.  The review was undertaken by Auckland-based law firm  Atkins
Holm Joseph Majurey  in partnership with  Environmental Resource
Management , Economic Development Minister  Gerry Brownlee  said in
a statement today. The government is seeking feedback and posted
the report on the ministry website.  While the  report , which assessed New Zealand’s regulations
against countries including Australia, Norway and the U.K.,
found the nation compares favorably, there was “room for
improvement,” Brownlee said.  Among the recommendations is a call for increased funding
to ensure existing agencies have adequate expertise to fulfill
their functions. It also suggests the ministry be legally
empowered to require and consider health, safety and
environmental information when resources are allocated.  “We can learn from jurisdictions with mature petroleum
industries, so that New Zealand can capture the benefit of their
experience,” Brownlee said. “At the same time, there will be
issues peculiar to New Zealand.”  Submissions are due Feb. 15, he said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
