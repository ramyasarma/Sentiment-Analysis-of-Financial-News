Tacita Dean , a British artist known
for her work with film, has been commissioned to create the next
installation for the lobby of London’s  Tate Modern , Tate said.  From Oct. 11 2011, Dean will fill the Turbine Hall with her
creation. She will come after China’s  Ai Weiwei , who has paved
the hall with 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds that can be
seen -- though not walked on -- through May 2, 2011.  The commission is part of a series that Unilever is
sponsoring for five years ending in 2012 to the tune of 2.16
million pounds ($3.43 million).  “We've never really had anyone who has approached the 
Turbine Hall from the point of view of filmmaking, and the role 
and importance of the camera in articulating and animating 
space,” said Tate Modern Chief Curator Sheena Wagstaff in an
interview at a press lunch.  Dean -- born in 1965 in Canterbury -- was shortlisted in
1998 for the  Turner Prize , the U.K.’s top contemporary-art
award. Three years later, she got her own show at Tate Britain.  Her body of work frequently incorporates the sea, and links
contemporary episodes with past tales and myths. The 1996
“Disappearance at Sea” was inspired by the life of the U.K.
sailor Donald Crowhurst, who set off in 1968 on a solo voyage
around the world and never came back.  Of the 11 artists preceding Dean in the Turbine Hall,
 Olafur Eliasson  is among the most popular. His “The Weather
Project” (2003-4) was a glowing representation of the sun.  Other participants in the Unilever series include Doris
Salcedo, who, through April 2008, showed “Shibboleth,” a 167-
meter crack in the concrete floor of the hall; and  Carsten
Hoeller , who installed slides between October 2006 and April
2007 that visitors could zip down.  The two British artists who have shown work in the Turbine
Hall so far are  Rachel Whiteread  (2005-6) and  Anish Kapoor 
(2002-3).  To contact the writer on the story:
