Canada’s dollar fluctuated as
commodities including crude oil swung between losses and gains
and the greenback declined against most of its major
counterparts before a U.S. Federal Reserve policy statement.  The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, weakened
against 13 of its 16 major peers after Bank of Canada Governor
 Mark Carney  said yesterday its “persistent strength” poses a
risk to the recovery. The Federal Open Market Committee is
scheduled to issue a statement at 2:15 p.m.  “The U.S. dollar is getting beaten up and Carney’s
comments are a headwind,”  David Watt , senior currency
strategist in Toronto at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
unit, said via e-mail. “Despite the U.S. dollar’s renewed
downward pressure, oil prices are going nowhere right now.”  The Canadian currency dropped as much as 0.4 percent to
C$1.0111 per U.S. dollar and rose 0.3 percent before trading at
C$1.0054 at 11:57 a.m. in Toronto, up 0.2 percent. It closed at
C$1.0074 yesterday, when it touched C$1.0028, the strongest
level since Dec. 7.  Crude oil for January delivery traded at $88.69 a barrel in
New York, up 0.1 percent, after earlier falling as much as 1
percent. The Standard & Poor’s/Toronto Stock Exchange Composite
Index rose 0.1 percent after falling 0.1 percent.  Productivity Rises  Canadian labor  productivity  unexpectedly rose 0.1 percent in
the third quarter after falling in the previous three-month
period, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists
predicted the measure of worker output per hour would fall 0.1
percent, the median of 14 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Canada’s index of leading  economic indicators  rose 0.3
percent in November, the second straight gain, led by increases
in housing and stock prices, the statistics agency said.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted the index would
rise 0.5 percent, based on the median of nine estimates.  Sales at U.S. retailers rose 0.8 percent in November, more
than forecast, as holiday shopping got under way, a sign
consumers will play a bigger role in the recovery.  Canadian government bonds fell, pushing the 10-year note
 yield  up nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.33
percent. It touched 3.348 percent, the highest level since June
21. The price of the 3.5 percent security due in June 2020
decreased 76 cents to C$101.39.  To contact the reporter on this story:
