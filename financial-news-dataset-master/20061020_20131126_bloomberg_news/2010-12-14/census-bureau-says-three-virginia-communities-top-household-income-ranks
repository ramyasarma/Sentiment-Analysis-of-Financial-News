The U.S. Census Bureau said today
that three communities in Virginia were the only counties in the
country with median household income over $100,000 a year.  The counties are Fairfax and Loudoun while the third area
is the city of Falls Church, which is deemed a “county
equivalent” by the federal government. All are located in the
northern part of Virginia within commuting distance of
Washington, D.C.  To contact the reporter on this story:
