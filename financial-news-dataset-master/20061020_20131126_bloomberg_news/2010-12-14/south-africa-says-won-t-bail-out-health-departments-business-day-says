South Africa’s National Treasury
won’t bail out provincial health departments that overspend or
amass bank overdrafts, Business Day reported, citing Finance
Minister Pravin Gordhan.  Offering bailouts undermined the constitution and rewarded
departments that didn’t comply with public financial laws, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Gordhan as saying.  Provincial health departments had overdrafts of 8 billion
rand ($1.2 billion) through March this year, Business Day said,
citing department of health data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
