Asian  stocks  rose, lifting the
regional benchmark index to its highest level since July 2008,
as increasing commodity prices boosted raw material shares.
Japanese exporters fell as the yen climbed against the dollar.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s No. 1 mining company,
advanced 0.5 percent in Sydney after copper prices reached a
record and crude oil prices advanced.  Cnooc Ltd. , China’s
largest offshore oil producer, climbed 0.8 percent in Hong Kong.
Reliance Industries Ltd., owner of the world’s biggest refining
complex, gained 1.3 percent in Mumbai.  Canon Inc. , the world’s
biggest camera maker, sank 0.5 percent after the yen’s advance
against the dollar soured its earnings outlook.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.9 percent to 135.5, the
highest level since July 24, 2008, as of 7:46 p.m. in Tokyo.
About three stocks gained for every two that fell. The gauge
dropped 0.3 percent last week as concern grew that China’s
central bank would raise interest rates. The bank instead
increased lenders’ reserve ratio requirements.  “Fears of an interest rate increase in China have not come
to fruition so far,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1
billion in Melbourne at Pengana Capital Ltd. “There’s a sense
of relief in markets. This may be only temporary as Chinese
authorities become increasingly concerned about the possibility
of inflationary pressures undermining the economy’s longer-term
growth prospects.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 0.2 percent, while
the broader Topix index rose 0.5 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index advanced 0.2 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index
climbed 0.6 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.5
percent.  S&P 500 Futures  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
advanced 0.6 percent to its highest level in a week as inflation
slowed, giving the central bank room to hold interest rates
steady after the fastest increase of any Asian country this year.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 0.2
percent today. In New York, the index gained 0.06 point to
1,240.46, after rising as much as 0.5 percent, as the Senate
started to vote on President Barack Obama’s tax-cut agreement
with Republicans, and investors turned their attention to the
Federal Reserve meeting on Dec. 14.  Material and energy stocks rose the most among the 10
industry groups represented on the MSCI Asia Pacific gauge. BHP
Billiton, also Australia’s biggest oil producer, climbed 0.5
percent to A$45.65 in Sydney.  Rio Tinto Group , the world’s
third-largest mining company, gained 0.2 percent to A$87.90.  OZ Minerals Ltd. , an Australian copper and gold mining
company, jumped 5.8 percent to A$1.73, while in Seoul, Korea
Zinc Co., the world’s largest producer of refined zinc, advanced
3.9 percent to 304,000 won.  Cnooc, PetroChina  Cnooc climbed 0.8 percent to HK$18.48 in Hong Kong and
 PetroChina Co. , the nation’s biggest oil company, gained 0.6
percent to HK$10. Reliance increased 1.3 percent to 1,055.25
rupees in Mumbai, the biggest contributor to the Bombay Stock
Exchange Sensitive Index’s gains today.  Commodities rallied and the dollar weakened yesterday after
China refrained from increasing interest rates. The Standard &
Poor’s GSCI  Index  of commodities advanced 1.3 percent at 5 p.m.
in New York as copper futures surged to a record high of $9,248
a metric ton in London.  Crude oil for January delivery increased 0.9 percent to
settle at $88.61 a barrel in New York, while the London Metal
Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals including
copper, zinc and aluminum rose 2.2 percent.  ‘Markets Taking Relief’  While Chinese inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in
more than two years, the central bank kept its benchmark
interest rate unchanged. That helped boost optimism that the
world’s fastest-growing major economy will keep fueling the
global expansion and demand for raw materials.  “One of the big macro-risks out there has been a Chinese
policy error,” said  Prasad Patkar , who helps manage about $1.8
billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “Markets
are taking a bit of relief that they’re not going to overdo
it.”  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. , the world’s largest
shipbuilder, jumped 8.9 percent to 417,000 won in Seoul after
saying that Hapag-Lloyd AG increased an order to 10 container
ships from six. Deliveries of the ships will take place between
July 2012 and November 2013, it said.  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.  rose 2.2 percent to NT$115
in Taipei after a research note from Mirae Asset Securities Co.
cited speculation that it will form a solar venture with  GCL
Poly Energy Holdings Ltd.  Hon Hai’s  Foxconn Technology Co.  unit
jumped 6.7 percent to NT$111.  U.S. Retail Sales  In Tokyo, NTN Corp., the world’s third-biggest bearing
maker climbed 5.2 percent to 449 yen after Credit Suisse Group
AG raised its investment rating to “outperform” from
“neutral.”  Li & Fung Ltd. , the No. 1 supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
advanced 1.6 percent to HK$45.40 in Hong Kong ahead of a report
that’s expected to show U.S. retail sales climbed as demand
recovers in the world’s biggest economy.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. ,
the biggest Hong Kong-listed clothier, gained 2 percent to
HK$38.85.  U.S. retail sales probably climbed in November for a fifth
consecutive month, economists said ahead of a Commerce
Department report later today. The median estimate of 62
economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for a 0.6 percent gain
following a 1.2 percent increase in October.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 11 percent through
yesterday in 2010, matching the gain by the S&P 500 and beating
the 9.1 percent increase by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.8 times estimated
 earnings  on average, compared with 14.5 times for the S&P 500
and 12.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Canon, Honda  Canon fell 0.5 percent to 4,080 yen in Tokyo after the yen
appreciated to 83.11 against the dollar, compared with 84.15 at
the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday. Honda Motor Co.,
with about 80 percent of its sales outside Japan, lost 0.2
percent to 3,170 yen. A stronger yen potentially reduces the
value of overseas revenue for Japanese companies.  “The yen’s appreciation will weigh on exporters” in Japan,
said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at Tachibana
Securities Co.  AGL Energy Ltd. , Australia’s largest electricity retailer,
slumped 4.9 percent to A$15.07 in Sydney after failing to buy
power assets from the New South Wales state government amid
reports that rival Origin Energy Ltd. and a unit of CLP Holdings
Ltd. succeeded.  To contact the reporter for this story:
