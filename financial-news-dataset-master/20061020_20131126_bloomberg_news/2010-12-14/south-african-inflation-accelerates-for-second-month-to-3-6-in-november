South African inflation accelerated
for a second month in November as gasoline costs increased,
while remaining inside the central bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent
target range.  The  inflation  rate rose to 3.6 percent from 3.4 percent in
October, the Pretoria-based statistics office said on its
 website  today. The  median estimate  of 18 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 3.5 percent. Prices rose 0.2 percent in the month.  The government increased gasoline prices by 2.5 percent on
Nov. 3 as crude oil climbed above $80 a barrel. The rand’s 12
percent rally against the dollar in the past six months has
helped to offset price pressures, keeping inflation inside the
central bank’s target band and enabling Governor  Gill Marcus  to
cut the benchmark interest  rate  three times this year to 5.5
percent.  “Inflation will probably average 4.5 percent next year and
accelerate a bit faster in 2012,” said  Jean-Francois Mercier ,
an economist at Citigroup Inc. in Johannesburg. “I wouldn’t be
too worried about inflation, not where the rand is at the
moment. We don’t see any further rate cuts.”  The rand was at 6.8386 against the dollar as of 11:50 a.m.
in Johannesburg, little changed from 6.8360 before the data was
released. The yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, was
unchanged at 7.36 percent.  Marcus said on Nov. 18 that inflation will probably average
4.3 percent this year and next. The bank has cut the key rate by
6.5 percentage points since December 2008 to help pull the
economy out of recession.  Growth in Africa’s biggest  economy  is still subdued, easing
pressure on inflation. Gross domestic product rose an annualized
2.6 percent in the third quarter, down from 2.8 percent in the
previous three months, the statistics office said on Nov. 23.  “The recovery has been fragile, with disappointing
growth,” Marcus said at the bank’s annual general meeting on
Dec. 8. Private sector investment is still “extremely
subdued,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
