Angolan President  Jose Eduardo  dos
Santos said Africa’s second-biggest oil producer is open to
finding new partners to help build a refinery at Lobito on the
country’s Atlantic coast.  “Angola is still open to including new partners in this
project,” dos Santos told reporters today in Pretoria, the
capital of South Africa, where he held talks with President
 Jacob Zuma .  PetroSA Ltd. of South Africa is still working out details
of a joint venture with Sonangol SA, Angola’s state-run oil
company, to build the refinery, Zuma said after the two
countries signed an agreement to collaborate on the project.  The Lobito plant will have the capacity to produce 200,000
barrels of oil a day, almost five times as much as Angola’s only
other refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
