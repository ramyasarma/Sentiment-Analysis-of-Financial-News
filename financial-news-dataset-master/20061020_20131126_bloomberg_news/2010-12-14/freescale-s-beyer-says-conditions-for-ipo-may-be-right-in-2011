Freescale Semiconductor Inc. , taken
private in a $17.6 billion buyout in 2006, may be ready for an
initial public offering in the coming year, Chief Executive
Officer  Rich Beyer  said.  The Austin, Texas-based chipmaker has  reorganized  its debts
and improved its performance, building “credibility in the
marketplace,” Beyer said. If the economy continues to recover
and the semiconductor industry grows next year, the company will
be in a position to sell shares, he said.  “We believe that we will be in a position to do an IPO,” he
said yesterday in an interview in San Francisco. “We have a
capital structure that works.”  Freescale , the largest supplier of chips to U.S.
automakers, will aim to raise more than $1 billion to pay down
$1.2 billion of debt coming due in 2014, Beyer said. The company
piled on debt when it was taken private by  Blackstone Group LP ,
Carlyle Group, Permira Advisers LLP and TPG Capital. Those
investors won’t sell their own shares yet and will allow the
company to raise cash with new equity in the IPO, Beyer said.  The company’s net loss narrowed to $156 million last
quarter, while sales jumped 29 percent to $1.15 billion. It
ended the quarter with $1.07 billion of cash and paid out $144
million in interest.  Freescale has a loan of about $560 million coming due in
2012, then $1.2 billion more in 2014. In 2016, Freescale must
 repay  about $3 billion.  Before 2016, “there will be many opportunities to pay it
down, to do converts that eliminate some of it,” Beyer said. “I
believe the capital structure is not scary to the financial
community.”  Separately, Freescale, which also supplies the main chips
in Amazon.com Inc.’s Kindle and Sony Corp.’s Reader electronic
readers, said the market for those devices hasn’t been hurt by
 Apple Inc. ’s iPad. Improvements in the reading experience on
dedicated readers will continue to outpace that offered by more
general tablets computers, Beyer said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
