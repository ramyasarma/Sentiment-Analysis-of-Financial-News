Taiwan’s dollar, Asia’s best-
performing currency this quarter, finished with an 0.5 percent
gain after retreating from a 13-year high on suspected central
bank intervention.  The currency rose as much as 2.3 percent to NT$29.890
versus the greenback, its highest since October 1997, before
trimming its gain to close at NT$30.45. The currency has
advanced 4.5 percent this quarter as global funds bought $1.5
billion more local shares than they sold this month, boosting
net purchases for the year to $8 billion.  “Strong foreign inflows and solid economic growth are
drivers of the Taiwan dollar’s gain,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-
based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial
Bank. “The central bank won’t allow such a big rise in the
currency. It’ll come in to smooth the moves.”  The monetary authority has bought U.S. dollars in late
trading most days since April to combat appreciation that poses
a threat to exports, according to two traders familiar with the
matter who asked not to be identified.  China Trade  Relations with China have improved since Taiwan President
 Ma Ying-jeou  won election in March 2008, abandoning his
predecessor’s pro-independence stance. The island has been self-
ruled since  Chiang Kai-shek ’s Nationalists fled the mainland in
1949 after losing to  Mao Zedong ’s Communists in a civil war.  Under the terms of a trade pact signed in June, China
agreed to open markets in 11 service sectors such as banking and
to cut duties on Taiwanese imports that were worth $13.8 billion
last year, or about 16 percent of the total.  Taiwan’s third-quarter growth of 9.8 percent was the
fastest among Asia’s 10 largest economies, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Taiwan’s Council for Economic Planning
and Development forecast gross domestic product will increase 5
percent in 2011, the Economic Daily reported yesterday.  The island’s government bonds rose today, dragging the
yield on benchmark 10-year  notes  down from a nine-month high.
The rate on the 1.125 percent security due September 2020 fell
two basis points to 1.482 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market, the island’s biggest exchange for bonds. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on the story:
