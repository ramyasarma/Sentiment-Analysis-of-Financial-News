Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s victory in a confidence motion ushered in a period
of political dealmaking to avoid another leadership challenge in
the remaining two years of his term.  Berlusconi said today he’d reach out to lawmakers who
opposed him yesterday in a no-confidence motion that he survived
with 314 votes, short of a majority in the 630-seat Chamber of
Deputies. The  yield premium  on Italian bonds over comparable
German bunds rose 2 basis points today to 161.  The vote “is a relief for Berlusconi for now,”  Lavinia Santovetti , an economist at Nomura International in London, said
in a telephone interview. “However, the outcome doesn’t change
the political situation that much in that Berlusconi won’t have
much of a majority,” meaning “a general election next spring
is a distinct possibility.”  Berlusconi said he was open to “a new relationship” with
many of the lawmakers who tried to topple him. Efforts to
broaden his coalition may prompt divisions among his allies and
still result in early elections, derailing efforts to curb
spending, cut debt and increase competitiveness. The risk
premium on Italian bonds has more than doubled this year as the
debt crisis engulfed the euro region.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
bonds over comparable German bunds surged to a euro-era record
of 212 basis points on Nov. 30 on concern about contagion after
Ireland’s bailout request. The Italian spread narrowed 2 basis
points to 159 basis points after the vote.  ‘Political Stalemate’  “Prolonged political stalemate is not good news,”  Chiara Corsa , a UniCredit SpA economist, said yesterday in a note to
investors. “It will prevent the government, whatever it will
be, from pushing ahead with the agenda of structural reforms
that Italy urgently needs in order to increase its low-growth
potential.”  In the decade since the start of the euro in 1999, Italy’s
annual economic growth averaged 0.6 percent, compared with 1.6
percent for the euro-zone.  Berlusconi won after persuading enough rebel lawmakers to
back him, saying the country couldn’t afford political turmoil
amid investor concerns over Italy’s debt load, the second
biggest in the euro region after Greece. Italy has fared better
than other so-called peripheral economies such as Spain and
Portugal with the lowest yield premium of the four.  Brush With Disaster  The vote was called after  Gianfranco Fini , co-founder of
Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party, broke with the premier in
July and began campaigning for his ouster. It was his latest
brush with political disaster.  The premier survived criminal allegations of bribery, false
accounting and tax fraud and still has two corruption trials
pending against him. Berlusconi says the charges are politically
motivated and denies any wrongdoing.  Ties to young women led his wife to file for divorce and
publicly accuse him of “consorting with minors.” The rift with
Fini deepened after Berlusconi admitted intervening with Milan
police on behalf of a 17-year old nightclub dancer in their
custody who had attended a party at his Milan mansion.  On the eve of the confidence vote, Berlusconi said he’d
seek to open his government to his opponents and bring Fini
supporters and members of the Union of Centrists party into his
Cabinet if he retained power. In an “appeal to all the
moderates,” he told senators he may “enlarge the government
majority” and “reinforce the government team,” an idea
rejected by Northern League leader  Umberto Bossi  on Dec. 12.  Ally’s Aim  Bossi, whose support has helped Berlusconi win three
elections, has been the driving force behind fiscal federalism,
a move to shift power to local governments in setting some taxes
and keeping more levies for services including health and
police.  Pier Ferdinando Casini ’s centrists’ party opposes the
overhaul, which has been approved but lacks implementing
legislation.  If the government is “expanded to include Casini or
individual deputies from the UDC who do not want elections,”
then “the implementing decrees of fiscal federalism are dead,”
 Robert Leonardi , senior lecturer in European politics at the
London School of Economics, said in an interview.  Bossi said after the vote that the Northern League wouldn’t
oppose opening to Casini’s party, Ansa news agency reported.
“There’s no veto against the UDC,” he was quoted as saying.  Before the parliamentary showdown, opposition leaders
called on prosecutors to investigate Berlusconi for vote buying
-- charges he denied. In the end, three Fini supporters switched
back to Berlusconi and a fourth abstained, giving the victory to
the three-time premier who has led the government for eight of
the past 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
