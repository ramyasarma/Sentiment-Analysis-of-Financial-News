Asian stocks advanced, lifting the
benchmark index to a five-week high, Taiwan’s dollar reached the
strongest level in 13 years and rubber rose to a record on
speculation central banks will adopt policies to support global
economic growth.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.7 percent to 135.18
as of 5 p.m. in Tokyo, set for the highest close since Nov. 8,
while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.1 percent following a
six-day gain. Taiwan’s currency touched NT$29.89 versus the U.S.
dollar, the most since October 1997, before closing at NT$30.45.
Rubber jumped as much as 1.2 percent to 400.1 yen. Futures on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.2 percent. The dollar
fell toward a one-week low against the euro as Treasuries slid.  Stocks are rallying before reports today that may show
improvements in U.S. retail sales and German investor confidence.
Policy makers at the Federal Reserve will discuss increasing
their bond purchase program and the Reserve Bank of India will
probably keep borrowing costs unchanged this week, after China
surprised investors by refraining from an interest-rate increase
over the weekend.  “We’re reasonably optimistic,”  Stephen Wood , New York-
based chief market strategist for Russell Investments, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “The Federal Reserve in the U.S.
has taken an ABD, or anything but deflation, policy. That’s
going to provide a floor under asset prices.”  Five stocks  advanced  for every three that fell on the MSCI
Asian index, which has jumped 12 percent this year. Gauges of
energy and raw material producers posted the biggest gains among
the measure’s 10 industry groups, with  Inpex Corp.  advancing 2.6
percent and  Korea Zinc Co.  jumping 3.9 percent.  Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co.  rose 2.2 percent in Taipei amid
speculation it will form a solar venture with GCL Poly Energy
Holdings Ltd., according to Mirae Asset Securities Co.  ‘Substantial’ Returns  “Absolute returns in 2011 should be substantial for Asian
equities,”  Ajay Kapur , Hong Kong-based head of Asian equity
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a report. “The economic
cycle is inflecting up. US policy is remarkably easy, as is
Europe, while Asia is tightening somewhat.”  The Taiwan dollar, Asia’s best-performing currency this
quarter, pared a gain of as much as 2.3 percent to close 0.5
percent higher on signs the central bank intervened to curb its
advance. It’s appreciated 4.5 percent this quarter. Global funds
bought $1.3 billion more local shares than they sold this month
through yesterday, boosting net purchases for the year to $7.8
billion. South Korea’s won rose 0.5 percent to 1,140.35 per
dollar, while the Malaysian ringgit climbed 0.4 percent to
3.1285 against the greenback.  Inflows, Growth  “Strong foreign inflows and solid economic growth are
drivers of the Taiwan dollar’s gain,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-
based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial
Bank.  The dollar fell against 15 of its 16 major counterparts
amid prospects that yields on U.S. assets will shrink. Fed
policy makers meeting today may signal that they are open to
boosting debt purchases beyond the $600 billion already
announced to spur job growth and avoid deflation. The central
bank has kept its target rate for overnight loans between banks
at a record-low range of zero to 0.25 percent since December
2008.  The greenback fell to $1.3456 per euro from $1.3391
yesterday, when it reached $1.3434, the weakest since Dec. 6.
The dollar fetched 83.29 yen from 83.39 yen yesterday, when it
touched 83.11 yen, the lowest since Dec. 7.  German Confidence  The euro was at 112.09 per yen from 111.67 before  data  from
the ZEW Center for European Economic Research that may show
German investor expectations rose to 3.9 this month from 1.8 in
November, while Italian lawmakers begin debating a no-confidence
motion against Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s government
today.  Yields  on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed two
basis points to 3.30 percent after dropping four basis points
yesterday. U.S. retail sales likely increased 0.6 percent in
November after advancing 1.2 percent in October, according to
the  median estimate  of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Japanese bonds rose before the central bank’s Tankan data
tomorrow that may show waning sentiment among manufacturers,
sending the yield on the benchmark 20-year bond lower by six
basis points to 2.07 percent.  Rubber for May delivery gained for a fifth day and settled
at 396.1 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Shipments from
Thailand decreased after heavy rain and flooding reduced latex
production, worsening a supply shortage as demand expands led by
China, the world’s largest consumer.  Copper, Oil  Copper was little changed at $9,230 a metric ton, after
rising to an all-time high on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday, while crude oil added 0.2 percent to $88.74 a barrel
after jumping 1 percent to $88.61 in New York yesterday amid a
cold spell in the U.S.  The cost of protecting corporate and sovereign bonds from
non-payment fell in the Asia-Pacific region, with the Markit
iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan
declining two basis points to 104 basis points, Credit Agricole
CIB prices show. The risk benchmark is heading for its lowest
close since Nov. 22, according to CMA in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
