The Development Bank of Southern
Africa Ltd. may triple investment in Angola, Africa’s second-
biggest oil producer, to $3 billion, South African Trade and
Industry Minister Rob Davies said.  The plan was outlined in one of five agreements signed
between the neighbors today during a visit by Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos to South Africa. The deals, which
include plans to collaborate in the telecommunications industry
and build an oil refinery together, are testament to the two
countries’ “determination to forge a strategic partnership,”
South African President Jacob Zuma told reporters in Pretoria.  Dos Santos’s three-day visit is his first official trip to
South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994. Zuma, who
presides over the continent’s biggest economy, in August last
year initiated closer relations with Angola when he visited the
capital, Luanda.  The Industrial Development Corp. of South Africa Ltd., a
state-owned lender that has $2 billion in foreign investments in
Africa, also plans to increase funding for Angola’s energy
industry, Davies said in an interview.  “We want to emphasize the importance we give to the
private sector, because it can be the engine for the economy,”
dos Santos said.  Oil accounts for about 90 percent of Angola’s 12 billion
rand ($1.8 billion) in exports to South Africa, according to the
ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
