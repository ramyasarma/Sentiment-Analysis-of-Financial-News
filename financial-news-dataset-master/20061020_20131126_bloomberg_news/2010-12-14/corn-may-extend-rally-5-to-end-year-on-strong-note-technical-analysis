Corn futures, set for the biggest
annual advance in four years, may extend gains to end the year
on a strong note, according to Barclays Capital.  “The commodity markets in general, with perhaps the
exception of natural gas, look set to see out the year on a
strong note, and this is no less the case for the agricultural
sector,” according to a report dated yesterday by analysts
including  Philip Roberts . “Corn, in particular, has been strong,
and we expect the 5 1/2-month trendline support in the $5.40
area to keep any downside move in check.”  Corn futures, which have rallied 42 percent this year, are
set for the biggest yearly gain since 2006 as rain and drought
reduced global  grain crops . The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of 19 raw materials has advanced 13 percent this year
after a 23 percent gain in 2009.  “On the back of trend resumption signaled by widening
Bollinger bands and the bullish” moving average convergence-
divergence crossover, a close over the range highs in the $5.80
area may drive futures to resistance of $5.97 and to test the
$6.17 high, the bank said.  Moving average convergence-divergence is a momentum
indicator, while Bollinger bands, developed by analyst John
Bollinger, are based on historical price swings. The bands
narrow and widen to reflect the size of those moves, and
represent possible support and resistance levels.  Corn for March delivery declined as much as 0.7 percent to
$5.8450 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade today. The most-
active contract surged as much as 2.6 percent yesterday to $5.89,
the highest level since Nov. 10, before ending at $5.8850.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
