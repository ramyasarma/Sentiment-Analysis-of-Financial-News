Raw sugar rose to a one-month high
in New York on concern that output in Brazil, the world’s
largest producer, will be lower than estimated. Cocoa also
gained, while coffee declined.  Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South, the world’s largest
producing region, fell 18 percent in the second half of
November, industry association Unica said. The group also cut
its forecast for the cane crop to 560 million metric tons, from
an Aug. 26 estimate of 570.2 million.  “Falling output in Brazil is helping the market stay
firm,”  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at Newedge
USA, wrote in a report today.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.29 cent, or 1
percent, to settle at 30.78 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, prices climbed to 31.27
cents, the highest level since Nov. 11. The most-active
contract gained 6.2 percent in the previous two sessions.  Production in Australia, the third-largest exporter, may
plunge to the lowest in almost two decades as wet weather
forces producers to leave some cane unharvested, the Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said
today. Output may drop 21 percent to 3.58 million tons in the
year ending June 30, the lowest since 1991-1992, the agency
said.  “Bullish news has been pouring from every part,”  Naim Beydoun  of Swiss Sugar Brokers in Rolle, Switzerland, wrote in
a report dated yesterday.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery gained
$14.20, or 1.9 percent, to $769.40 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for March delivery rose $50, or 1.7 percent,
to $2,940 a ton in New York. In London, cocoa futures for March
delivery gained 45 pounds, or 2.4 percent, to 1,944 pounds
($3,071) a ton.  Robusta coffee futures for March delivery fell $11, or 0.6
percent, to $1,923 a ton on NYSE Liffe, declining for the first
time in six sessions. The price gained 2.4 percent last week.
Arabica coffee for March delivery declined 0.85 cent, or 0.4
