The number of condominiums put up
for sale in Tokyo and surrounding areas rose for a 10th straight
month in November, suggesting that Japanese property developers
expect a recovery in demand to continue.  The number of new condominiums put on the market rose 0.8
percent in November from a year earlier, the Real Estate
Economic Research Institute said in a report released in Tokyo
today. The rising streak was the longest since the period ended
February 2000 when sales rose for 18 months straight.  To contact the reporters on this story:
