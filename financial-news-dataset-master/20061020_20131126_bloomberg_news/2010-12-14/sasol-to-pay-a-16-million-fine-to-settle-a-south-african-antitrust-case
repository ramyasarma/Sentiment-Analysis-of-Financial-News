Sasol Ltd. , the largest producer of
motor fuels made from coal, agreed to pay 112 million rand
($16.4 million) to settle an antitrust case after agreeing that
it “indirectly” fixed polypropylene prices in South Africa.  The penalty is 3 percent of the Johannesburg-based
company’s 2009 turnover derived from polypropylene products, the
Competition Commission said in a statement today. Sasol’s
contravention was of a “technical” nature and there was no
“intentional agreement to fix prices,” the company said in a
separate statement.  Sasol earlier this year agreed to pay 251 million rand and
sell five fertilizer blending plants after breaking anti-cartel
rules. In 2008, it was fined 318 million euros ($407 million) by
the European Union for its part in a wax cartel. South African
authorities are probing other company operations.  Sasol is South Africa’s largest supplier of polypropylene,
made of propylene. Polypropylene is used to make rigid plastics
products from chairs to bottle tops.  The Competition Commission also found Sasol charged
“excessive prices” for propylene and polypropylene, the
commission said. Sasol doesn’t agree with the commission and is
contesting the allegations, the company said.  Shares  in Sasol fell as much as 2.38 rand, or 0.7 percent,
to 327.30 rand, and were at 329.50 rand at the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
