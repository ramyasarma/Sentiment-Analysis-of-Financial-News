The benchmark price of tea in
Malawi, Africa’s largest producer of the crop after Kenya, fell
6.8 percent at an auction today as demand waned ahead of the
start of a new crop, according to Van Rees BV, a tea trading
unit of Netherlands-based NIBC Principal Investments.  The top grade of tea, known as pekoe fannings, fetched
$2.20 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) at the sale in the commercial
capital,  Blantyre , down from $2.36 at the previous sale two
weeks ago, the tea trader said in an e-mailed report today.  The auction “was one of the smallest sales of the year,”
said  Emmanuel Phiri , a manager at Van Rees, by phone from the
city. There was limited demand “because buyers are waiting for
fresh leaves” which are due from Dec. 28, he said.  Supplies at the sale rose 20 percent to 134,380 kilograms
while revenue jumped 49 percent to $217,184, Van Rees said.  Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign exchange earner,
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from Malawi,
followed by South Africa and Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
