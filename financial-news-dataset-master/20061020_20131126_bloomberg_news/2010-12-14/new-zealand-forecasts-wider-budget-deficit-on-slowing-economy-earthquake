New Zealand’s budget cash deficit
will be wider than the government’s earlier forecast as a
slower-than-projected economic recovery curbs tax receipts and
the worst earthquake in 80 years increases costs.  The cash deficit will be NZ$15.6 billion ($12 billion) in
the year ending June 30, wider than the NZ$13.3 billion forecast
in May’s budget, the Treasury Department said in a statement
released in Wellington today. The deficit is forecast to narrow
to NZ$9.69 billion in 2012 and will disappear by 2016, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
