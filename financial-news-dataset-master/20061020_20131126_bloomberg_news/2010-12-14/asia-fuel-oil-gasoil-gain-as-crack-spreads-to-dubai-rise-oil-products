Asian fuel oil and gasoil swaps rose
as crack spreads to Dubai crude gained, signaling increased
profit for refiners. Naphtha’s premium to Brent crude retraced
some of yesterday’s drop.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for January increased $2.25, or
0.4 percent, to $509.25 a metric ton at 12:30 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates, a brokerage.
That’s the highest since Dec. 6. Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai
crude, the Asian benchmark, narrowed 40 cents to $10.03 a
barrel, indicating losses from making the residue were the
narrowest in a week.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged for a second day at $9 a ton, PVM said. This
 viscosity spread  has widened 13 percent so far this month,
meaning bunker, or marine fuel, prices have gained less than
higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  January  gasoil , or diesel, swaps rose 45 cents, or 0.4
percent, to a one-week high of $102.85 a barrel, according to
PVM. The premium to Dubai crude climbed 50 cents to $14.47 a
barrel. This  crack spread  was at $15.43 on Dec. 7, the widest
since January 2009.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was down for a second day at
$1.05 a barrel, the narrowest since Nov. 22, based on PVM data.
This  regrade  has lost 37 percent this month, signaling it’s less
profitable to produce aviation fuel compared with diesel.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for second-half January delivery were bid at $847.50 a
ton against offers at $850.50, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. That’s up from yesterday’s close of
$844.75.  Naphtha’s crack spread to Brent crude gained $3.69 to
$161.42 a ton, retracing some of yesterday’s 5.5 percent drop,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The difference has
narrowed about 6 percent in December.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday rose to $7.40 a
barrel, the most since Dec. 7, Bloomberg calculations showed. A
widening  reforming margin  shows motor fuel is more profitable
compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
