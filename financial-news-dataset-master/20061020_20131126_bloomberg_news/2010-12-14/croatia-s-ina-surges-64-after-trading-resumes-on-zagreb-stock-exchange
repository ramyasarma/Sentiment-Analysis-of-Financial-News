INA Industrija Nafte d.d.  surged 64
percent to its highest in two years amid speculation Croatia’s
pension funds are trying to outbid an offer from Hungary’s  Mol
Nyrt.  for a minority stake in the country’s biggest oil refiner.  The shares biggest intraday gain on record lifted the
price to 2,830 kuna at 1:15 p.m. in Zagreb, its highest since
September 2008. INA resumed trading today after market regulator
suspended the stock on Dec. 3 following an offer from Mol, which
owns 47 percent of INA, to buy an additional 8 percent.  The Croatian  government  on Dec. 10 said it may take “steps
to protect its strategic interests in the energy sector.” The
country’s pension funds are considering a counteroffer as they
estimate the shares are worth more than Mol’s bid, Poslovni
Dnevnik reported on Dec. 6.  “We see the news positive for INA as it provides
additional upside coming from the counteroffer,” analyst
 Philipp Chladek  at Raiffeisen Centrobank AG in Vienna, wrote in
an e-mail today. Croatian cigarette maker  Adris Grupa d.d.  may
also bid for the INA stake, he wrote.  Mol on Dec. 2 offered to pay 2.24 billion kuna ($407
million) for the 8 percent stake, or 2,800 kuna per share. The
Croatian government owns 45 percent.  INA Chairman  Zoltan Aldott  yesterday said Mol’s offer is
fixed and the Hungarian company won’t enter a bidding war if the
Croatian government makes a counteroffer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
