Swiss stocks rose after the
government raised its economic growth forecast, industrial
production climbed across the euro region and ahead of a U.S.
Federal Reserve meeting.  Julius Baer Group Ltd., the 120-year-old private bank,
gained 1.9 percent and  Panalpina Welttransport Holding AG , the
Swiss freight forwarder, rose 5.8 percent.  Logitech
International SA , the world’s biggest maker of computer mice,
tumbled 3.2 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies increased 0.4 percent to 6,545.84 at the 5:30
p.m. close of trading in Zurich. The measure has rallied 10
percent since July 5 as rising corporate earnings, the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s purchase of $600 billion of treasuries and a
bailout of Ireland boosted investor sentiment. The broader  Swiss
Performance Index  added 0.3 percent today.  “The economic outlook has an impact but very few stocks
only give you Swiss exposure,” said Zurich-based  Philipp Leibundgut , who advises the Valartis Swiss Mid & Small Cap
Selection Fund. “I see pretty robust growth continuing in the
manufacturing sector.”  Switzerland’s government raised its economic growth
forecast for 2011, led by consumer demand and stronger-than-
expected exports.  Swiss gross domestic product will rise 1.5 percent next
year instead of 1.2 percent projected in September, the State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Bern said today in a faxed
statement. The economy will expand 1.9 percent in 2012. For
2010, the government left its forecast unchanged at 2.7 percent.  Fed Meeting  U.S. Federal Reserve officials will probably make no change
to the size of the stimulus when they meet today in Washington
for the last time this year, according to 38 of 39 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey on Dec. 7-8. Fed Chairman  Ben Bernanke , in an
interview broadcast on Dec. 5, told CBS Corp.’s “60 Minutes”
that the recovery may not be self-sustaining and more purchases
of debt beyond the $600 billion approved by the Fed through June
are “certainly possible.”  A report today showed sales at U.S. retailers rose more
than forecast in November as holiday shopping got under way.
Purchases increased 0.8 percent following a 1.7 percent gain in
October that was larger than previously estimated, the Commerce
Department said.  Another report today said German investor confidence
improved for a second month in December as the recovery in
Europe’s largest economy showed signs of broadening.  ZEW Center  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict developments six months ahead, increased to 4.3 from
1.8 in November. Economists expected a gain to 3.9, according to
the median of 36 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Industrial production increased across the 16-nation euro
region October led by orders for capital goods such as machinery
and tools. Output in the 16-nation euro region rose 0.7 percent
from September, when it fell a revised 0.7 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.  Julius Baer advanced for a fourth day. Shares climbed 1.9
percent to 43.91 Swiss francs, the highest since Oct. 2 2009,
after Cheuvreux added the bank to its “selected” list and
raised its price estimate for the stock to 51 francs from 46
francs.  SGS SA , the world’s biggest goods inspector, increased 1.5
percent to 1,667 francs after Deutsche Bank AG raised its price
estimate for the stock to 1,700 francs from 1,500 francs.  “We believe SGS is a long-term structural growth story and
should continue to benefit from targeted acquisitions,” wrote
analysts in a note to clients today.  Panalpina surged 5.8 percent to 123.8 francs after  Goldman
Sachs Group , Inc. raised its price estimate for the stock to 170
francs from 150 francs.  Logitech dropped 3.2 percent to 18.84 francs after Barclays
Plc initiated coverage of the stock with an “underweight”
rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
