Japan’s  stocks  rose for a second day,
led by financial shares, on speculation tax breaks will be
maintained and after Deutsche Bank AG restated its
“overweight” rating on bank shares.  Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest brokerage, rose 1.5
percent after a report yesterday that the Financial Services
Agency opposes an end to reduced capital-gains taxes. Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc., the nation’s largest bank by market
value, increased 0.5 percent. NTN Corp., a bearing maker, and
 Olympus Corp. , an optical-equipment maker, jumped at least 3.6
percent after analysts raised the companies’ ratings.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 0.2 percent to
10,316.77 in Tokyo, its highest close since May 14. The  Topix 
index increased 0.5 percent to 901.89 with more than three times
as many stocks advancing as declining. It was the Topix’s first
close above 900 since June 21.  “Money is flowing into lagging Japanese stocks such as
brokerages and banks as the markets are awash with excess
liquidity,” said  Yoshihiro Ito , chief strategist at Okasan
Online Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his policy
board announced on Nov. 3 an additional $600 billion of Treasury
purchases through June to bring down the jobless rate and avert
deflation. In the five weeks since the announcement, foreigners
have been net buyers of Japanese stocks, according to Tokyo
Stock Exchange data.  Corporate Tax Cut  The Topix has lost 0.6 percent in 2010, compared with a
gain of 11 percent by the S&P 500 and 9.1 percent by the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
15.6 times estimated  earnings  on average, compared with 14.5
times for the S&P 500 and 12.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Securities companies have declined 18 percent and banks are
down 5.1 percent this year, compared with drops of 2.2 percent
by the Nikkei and 0.6 percent by the Topix. Brokerages had the
second-largest year-to-date decline among the Topix’s 33
industry groups after mining companies.  Nomura climbed 1.5 percent to 527 yen, the highest since
June 23, and was the most  actively traded stock  by value in
Japan. Daiwa Securities Group Inc., the second-biggest, rose 2.9
percent to 427 yen. Mizuho Securities Co. leapt 4.1 percent to
228 yen.  Yesterday two government officials said Japan may extend a
capital-gains tax break by a year after the Financial Services
Agency opposed ending it in 2011 as scheduled.  Tax Break  “Gains in brokerages indicate investors are thinking a
full-fledged recovery has started,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a
senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion.  Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called for a 5 percentage
point cut in the nation’s corporate tax rate, Kyodo News
reported, citing government officials it didn’t identify.  “A tax cut would be positive for Japanese companies and
expectations for corporate earnings will increase. This should
support the market,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co.  Mitsubishi UFJ increased 0.5 percent to 433 yen. Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-biggest bank by
market value, rose 0.6 percent to 2,805 yen. Mizuho Financial
Group Inc., the No. 3, gained 0.7 percent to 144 yen.  Machinery Makers Rise  Deutsche Bank analyst  Yoshinobu Yamada  restated his rating
on Japan’s banking sector at “overweight,” saying “banks
excluding Resona Holdings Inc. are unlikely to recapitalize for
at least the next year or two.”  Machinery makers  extended yesterday’s gain after Credit
Suisse raised its rating on NTN, a bearing maker, to
“outperform” from “neutral” today. NTN leapt 5.2 percent to
449 yen, a level not seen since Jan. 21. SMC Corp., a maker of
directional-control devices, advanced 0.8 percent to 14,370 yen.
Komatsu Ltd., the world’s second-largest maker of earth movers,
rose 1.2 percent to 2,491.  A gauge of machinery makers was the second-strongest
support to the Topix among its 33 industry groups.  Inpex Corp., Japan’s No. 1 oil explorer, rose 2.6 percent
to 480,000 yen, the highest close since July 5.  Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. , the nation’s second-biggest oil driller,
climbed 3.9 percent to 3,170 yen. The index group that includes
those companies had the  biggest increase  in the Topix. JX
Holdings Inc., Japan’s No. 1 oil refiner and copper producer,
advanced 1.7 percent to its record high of 556 yen.  Crude oil for January delivery increased 0.9 percent to
settle at $88.61 a barrel in New York yesterday. Copper futures
rose to a record of $9,235.25 in London.  Olympus , an optical-equipment maker, climbed 3.6 percent to
2,556 yen and was the biggest support for the Nikkei 225. The
company had its rating increased to “buy” from “hold” at
Deutsche Bank AG.  New products launches will help boost earnings through
March 2013, said  Yoshikazu Higurashi , a Deutsche Bank analyst,
in a report dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter for this story:
