Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. SA ,
the world’s second-largest bottler of Coke drinks, is offering
94 million euros ($125.8 million) to take full control of the
 Nigerian Bottling Company plc , or NBC.  Coca-Cola HBC, which has a 66.4 percent stake in NBC, is
offering the other holders the money to cancel their
shareholding in the Nigerian bottler, Athens-based Coca-Cola HBC
said today in an e-mailed statement.  If approved by NBC’s other shareholders, the transaction
will take place during the second quarter of 2011 and NBC would
be delisted from the Nigerian Stock Exchange, according to the
statement.  The proposed move will result in cost savings, reduce
complexity and allow NBC to fully use the financial strength and
resources of its parent, Coca-Cola HBC said.  The volume of cases shipped by Coca-Cola HBC rose 5 percent
to 610.5 million euros in the third-quarter reflecting “strong
volume performance” in “key markets” such as Nigeria, the
company said Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
