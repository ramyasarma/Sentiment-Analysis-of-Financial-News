U.S. retail sales will climb more
than anticipated this holiday season as shoppers snap up gifts
at the last minute, according to an industry index.  Sales in the week ended Dec. 11 rose 0.8 percent, according
to the ICSC-Goldman Sachs Weekly Chain Store Sales Index. Same-
store sales at some U.S. retailers may rise as much as 4 percent
in November and December, compared with an earlier projection of
up to 3.5 percent, according to a statement today.  Last week comparable-store sales rose 3.1 percent from a
year ago, according to the index. Fewer consumers have finished
holiday shopping compared with the same time last year, “which
suggests a stronger late-buying rush over the next two weeks,”
said  Michael Niemira , the International Council of Shopping
Centers’s chief economist.  The findings contrast with results at  Best Buy Co. , the
world’s largest consumer-electronics retailer, which today
lowered its profit forecast for the year, saying U.S. sales fell
more than expected.  Some shoppers are picking up more jewelry, with sales
poised to climb 6 percent to $4.39 billion, according to Los
Angeles-based researcher IBISWorld Inc. That compares with a
drop of about 10 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
