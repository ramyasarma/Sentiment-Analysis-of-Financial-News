Boeing Co.  said it fully opened an
antenna reflector for its satellite built for billionaire  Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared wireless venture, resolving a malfunction
discovered after its November launch.  The satellite is part of Falcone’s effort to build out a
so-called fourth-generation wireless service aimed at competing
against  AT&T Inc.  and Verizon Wireless. Falcone is required by
the Federal Communications Commission to supplement his network
with satellite coverage.  “All deployment indicators are nominal,” Boeing said in a
statement e-mailed by Angie Yoshimura, a spokeswoman. She said
in an interview the malfunction was resolved last night.  Boeing, based in Chicago, said it will continue testing the
satellite over the coming months before handing operations over
to LightSquared.  Falcone, 48, is the founder of the Harbinger Capital
Partners hedge fund, the parent of Reston, Virginia-based
LightSquared.  "LightSquared is proceeding on schedule with its roll-out
of the nation’s first integrated wireless broadband and
satellite network,’’ Martin Harriman, a LightSquared executive
vice president, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
