Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  won a confidence motion in the Senate, setting up a
showdown in the Chamber of Deputies where his government may be
toppled two years before its term ends.  Berlusconi, 74, triumphed in the upper house, where he has
a majority, by 162 to 135, Senate Speaker  Renato Schifano 
announced. The premier’s political fate will be decided by the
lower house, where debate is under way. Final results there
should come by 2 p.m. in Rome.  Vote estimates indicate the thinnest possible margins.
Newspaper  La Repubblica  estimated the Chamber of Deputies, the
630-seat lower house, will bring down Berlusconi by 313 to 312.
Corriere della Sera reckons the incumbent winning by 313 to 312.  A loss in the Chamber vote would force Berlusconi to offer
his resignation to President  Giorgio Napolitano . The president
would then consult parties to see if another government can be
formed with or without Berlusconi as its head, before calling
for a vote. Even with his popularity at record low levels, polls
indicate that the premier’s coalition might win re-election.  To contact the reporters on this story:
