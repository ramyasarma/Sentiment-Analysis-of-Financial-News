The following table details the 
differences between small-town and big-city life in America
based on estimates released today by the U.S. Census Bureau.  The estimates are compiled from 2005-2009 data from the
American Community Survey, the last survey before the 2010 Census 
count is released Dec. 21. U.S. metropolitan statistical
areas are those with urban areas of 50,000 or more 
people. The so-called ‘micropolitan’ areas have at least
one cluster of 10,000 but less than 50,000 inhabitants.  SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau                           To contact the reporter on this story:
