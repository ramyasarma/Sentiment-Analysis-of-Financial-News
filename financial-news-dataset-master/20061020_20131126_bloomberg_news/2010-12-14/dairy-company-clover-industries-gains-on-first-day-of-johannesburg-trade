Clover Industries Ltd. , South
Africa’s largest dairy supplier, rose on its trading debut on
Johannesburg’s stock exchange and said it plans to take full
control of its beverages and Botswana units.  The stock  gained  as much as 50 cents, or 5 percent, to 11
rand, and closed at 10.90 rand at 5 p.m. local time, giving the
company a market value of about 1.9 billion rand ($278 million).  “We’ve got lots of plans,” Chief Executive Officer  Johann Vorster  said in a speech in the city today. “We want to
expand.”  Clover raised 575 million rand in a three times
oversubscribed share offer before the listing, selling 54.8
million  shares  at 10.50 rand each to investors including
Fidelity International and Allan Gray Ltd. It will start talks
in February to buy out minority shareholders in its South
African beverage and Botswana businesses, Vorster said today,
declining to estimate the value of the two transactions.  The company, which supplies more than a quarter of South
Africa’s fresh milk, will use the funds raised in the private
placement to expand output, reorganize logistics and cut debt.
Clover will consider raising more funds after the listing should
it find acquisition candidates, Vorster said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
