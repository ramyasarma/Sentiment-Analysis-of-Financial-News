Turkish bond yields dropped to a
record low on expectations the central bank will cut the
benchmark interest rate.  Two-year benchmark  bond yields  fell as much as 11 basis
points to 7.33 percent and were at 7.36 percent at 10:12 a.m. in
Istanbul.  Yields have fallen from 7.69 percent on Dec. 12 since
Deputy Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci said the bank may cut
the one-week repo rate to limit the current-account deficit. The
central bank’s monetary policy committee, which has kept its
benchmark rate at 7 percent for a year, holds its next
rates meeting on Dec. 16.  “Rate cut expectations have created very serious moves in
bonds and currency,” said Cem Tozge, a fund manager in Istanbul-
based Ata Yatirim Mengul Degerler AS said in a phone interview.  Basci made his suggestion in a paper published over the
weekend on the central bank’s website. He also called for higher
reserve requirements for banks, to curb consumer lending.  The lira gained 0.3 percent to 1.5017 per dollar at 10:15
a.m. in Istanbul.  A 50 basis points rate cut by the central bank may not
deter investors from buying Turkish bonds and currency, said
Ercan Uysal, head of research in Standard Unlu Menkul Degerler.  A rate of “6.5 percent is still higher than 0 percent,”
Uysal said in a phone interview, referring to the low interest
rates in developed economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
