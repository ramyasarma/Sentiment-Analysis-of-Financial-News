Crude oil dropped after the Federal
Reserve said it would retain its plan to buy $600 billion of
Treasuries by June, strengthening the dollar.  Futures fell 0.4 percent as the Open Market Committee said
today that it would maintain the program because the economic
recovery is insufficient to bring down unemployment. An Energy
Department report tomorrow may show that oil supplies dropped
last week, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “There were rumors that the Fed would increase the
stimulus beyond the $600 billion,” said  Jason Schenker ,
president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based
energy consultant. “The dollar has strengthened some since the
announcement.”  Crude oil for January delivery declined 33 cents to settle
at $88.28 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures
are up 27 percent from a year ago. Prices reached $90.76 a
barrel on Dec. 7, the highest level since October 2008.  Brent crude oil for January settlement increased 2 cents to
end the session at $91.21 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures exchange.  The U.S. currency rose 0.1 percent to $1.3383 per euro at
2:49 p.m. in New York. Earlier, the dollar dropped as much as
0.8 percent to $1.3499, the lowest level since Nov. 23. A
stronger dollar reduces the appeal of commodities as an
alternative investment.  The Fed agreed to expand bond purchases last month, a move
called quantitative easing, to increase economic growth.  “We’re getting some good economic news, which will enable
the Fed to refrain from increasing quantitative easing, and
potentially pull back in the future,” said  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy.  U.S. Optimism  Optimism among U.S. chief executives in the fourth quarter
rose to the highest level since the start of 2006 as business
leaders projected increased sales, investment and  hiring , a
private survey showed. The  Business Roundtable’s  economic
outlook index climbed to 101, the Washington-based group said
today. Readings higher than 50 signal an expansion.  Gasoline inventories  increased 2 million barrels in the
week ended Dec. 10, according to the median of 17 analyst
responses in a Bloomberg News survey. Crude-oil  supplies 
probably dropped 2.5 million barrels. Analysts were split over
whether stockpiles of distillate fuel rose or fell.  Gasoline for January delivery declined 2.2 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.2964 a gallon in New York, the lowest settlement
since Nov. 30.  “The failure to stay above $90 last week hangs over the
market,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at
Tradition Energy, a Stamford, Connecticut-based broker. “At the
same time we’ve got speculators trying to bid this higher, and
that won’t change until they either run out of money or go
somewhere else.”  Hedge Funds  Managed money, including hedge funds, commodity pools and
commodity-trading advisers, increased  net-long positions  by
42,603 futures and options combined to 206,807 the week ended
Dec. 7, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in its
Commitments of Traders report on Dec. 10.  “We’ll continue playing around $90 and maybe strike at
$100 before the year’s end,” Armstrong said.  Global oil demand has exceeded supply by more than 900,000
barrels a day on a seasonally adjusted basis since May, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said in an e-mailed report yesterday. Goldman
said it expects the world oil market to remain in deficit in the
first half of next year. Crude will average $100 a barrel in
2011 and $110 a barrel in 2012, according to Goldman estimates.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil-exporting country,
won’t immediately increase production when prices reach $100 a
barrel, according to Banque Saudi Fransi.  “In order for Saudi Arabia to push other OPEC members to
do something, prices have to remain at $100 for a long period
and not only for some weeks or a month,”  John Sfakianakis ,
chief economist at the Riyadh-based bank, said today by phone.
“This is not likely to happen soon.”  OPEC Targets  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries kept its
output quota unchanged at a Dec. 11 meeting in Quito, Ecuador.
OPEC has maintained a target of 24.845 million barrels a day
since December 2008, the longest period without a change since
it was first used in 1982.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 538,397 contracts as of 3:22
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 692,514
contracts yesterday, close to the average of the past three
months. Open interest was 1.38 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
