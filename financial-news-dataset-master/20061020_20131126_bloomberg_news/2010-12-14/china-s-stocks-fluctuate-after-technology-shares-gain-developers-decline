China’s stocks  rose to the highest
in a month as computer software companies rallied on speculation
the government will boost investment in the industry as part of
new economic reforms, overshadowing declines by energy producers.  UFIDA Software Co. and  China National Software & Service Co. 
advanced at least 1.8 percent after Shanghai Securities News
reported the government will maintain preferential policies for
the industry. Jiangxi Wannianqing Cement Co. climbed to the
highest since September 2007 after saying profit may more than
double this year.  PetroChina Co. , the country’s biggest listed
company, snapped a two-day, 5 percent advance as oil retreated.  The  Shanghai Composite Index  climbed for a third day,
adding 4.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,927.08 at the 3 p.m.
close, the highest since Nov. 15. The gauge jumped 2.9 percent
yesterday, the most in eight weeks, after the central bank
refrained from raising borrowing costs. The  CSI 300 Index  rose
0.3 percent to 3,269.47.  “The market needs a break here and some small-cap stocks
in industries the government is seeking to support will continue
to outperform,” said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief
investment officer at Jingxi Investment Management Co., which
manages about $120 million. “We had a nice run-up after the
central bank decided not raise interest rates over the
weekend.”  The Shanghai gauge has lost 7.4 percent since reaching an
almost seven-month high on Nov. 8 on concern that monetary
tightening will curb economic growth. The central bank on Dec.
10 ordered lenders to park more money with the central bank for
the third time in five weeks to soak up excessive liquidity.  Support Plan  A gauge of technology stocks advanced 1.4 percent, the
second most among the 10 industry groups in the CSI 300.
Software companies rose on the outlook for increasing government
support for new strategic industries after the conclusion of the
so-called economic work conference this past weekend.  China plans to have more than 10 software companies each
with annual sales exceeding 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) over
the next five years, the Shanghai Securities News reported today,
citing Zhao Xiaofan, Vice Chairman of China Software Industry
Association. The government will not change its policy for
supporting the industry, the newspaper cited Zhao as saying.  UFIDA climbed 1.8 percent to 24.79 yuan. China National
Software advanced 3.2 percent to 24.30 yuan.  Shandong Langchao
Cheeloosoft Co. , a software company, jumped 7.2 percent to 17.77
yuan, the biggest gain since Nov. 4.  ‘Reasonably Priced’  “IT services, software are areas that people are ignoring
at the moment,”  Hugh Simon , co-manager of the Dreyfus Greater
China Fund, said yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview.
“As you want to be more efficient and go up the value chain as
a manufacturer, you have will have to use more software. They
are reasonably priced.”  ISoftStone Holdings Ltd., a Beijing-based information
technology services provider, raised $141 million pricing its
U.S. initial public offering at the top of the forecast range.
The sale was the 40th U.S. IPO from a mainland company in
2010, capping a record year that exceeded the 37 deals in 2007
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Jiangxi Wannianqing Cement jumped by the 10 percent daily
limit to 13.09 yuan after saying net income may increase between
100 percent to 150 percent this year on increased sales and
product prices.  Other cement makers also gained. Anhui Conch Cement Co.,
China’s biggest cement maker, rose 4 percent to 30.77 yuan.
 Huaxin Cement Co. , the Chinese affiliate of Holcim Ltd., climbed
7.9 percent to 31.98 yuan.  Oil Stocks  PetroChina, the country’s biggest listed company, slid 1.1
percent to 11.82 yuan after surging 4.4 percent yesterday. The
shares trade at 17.7 times reported earnings, compared with 15.3
times at the beginning of October.  Other energy companies also fell as crude prices declined
from a four-day high in New York. China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp., Asia’s biggest oil refiner, also known as Sinopec, lost
0.8 percent to 8.29 yuan.  ICBC, the nation’s biggest listed lender, dropped 0.2
percent to 4.27 yuan. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the third
largest, fell 0.4 percent to 2.65 yuan.  The central bank extended a temporary 50 basis point
increase in the reserve requirement for some of the nation’s
lenders by three months, said two people briefed on the matter.  Separately, China is likely to set a target of at least 7
trillion yuan of new loans for 2011, according to two people
briefed on the matter.  While a quota of more than 7 trillion yuan would be less
than the previous two years, it would exceed estimates made by
UBS AG and Bank of America Corp. in the past month, suggesting
the government may avoid stepping up a clampdown on  lending .  The central bank has a target of 7.5 trillion yuan of new
loans for 2010, a ceiling that was almost breached in the first
11 months of the year, and has forced banks to set aside more
deposits as reserves three times in five weeks.  -- Zhang Shidong . Editors:  Allen Wan ,  Richard Frost   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
