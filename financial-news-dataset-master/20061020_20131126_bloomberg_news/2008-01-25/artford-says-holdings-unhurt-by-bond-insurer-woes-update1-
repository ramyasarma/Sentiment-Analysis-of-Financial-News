             Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG)  said it expects no material impact on its municipal bond
holdings related to the struggles of the financial guarantors
that insure the securities.  
 Hartford has $13.5 billion in municipal bonds, about half
of which are insured, said  Ramani Ayer , chief executive officer
of the Hartford, Connecticut-based insurer, in a conference call
today.  
 The largest U.S. insurance companies, including  American
International Group Inc. (AIG) , MetLife Inc. and Hartford fell in New
York trading in the last two weeks on concern the value of their
fixed-income portfolios may decline if bond guarantors lose
their top ratings.  Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ)  became the first
bond insurer to lose its AAA grade after Fitch Ratings
downgraded the company Jan. 18.  
 Travelers Cos., (TRV)  the second-largest U.S. commercial insurer,
said Jan. 22 that any reduction in value on its $14.1 billion of
insured municipal bonds would be ``immaterial'' if the coverage
on the securities evaporated.  
 Hartford declined $2.18, or 2.7 percent, to $77.71 at 10:43
a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
has dropped about 15 percent in the past year.
