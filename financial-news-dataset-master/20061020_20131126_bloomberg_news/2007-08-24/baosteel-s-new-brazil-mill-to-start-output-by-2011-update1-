             Baosteel Group Corp.,  China 's
biggest steelmaker, expects to start production at a new mill in
 Brazil  by 2011 to help meet growing demand in the Asian country.  
 Baosteel will begin construction of the $3.6 billion mill
``as soon as environmental permits are approved,'' Zhao Kun, a
Baosteel vice president, said today at a press conference in
Vitoria, Brazil. Cia. Vale do Rio Doce, the world's largest
iron-ore producer, will own a 20 percent stake in the mill.  
 ``Baosteel is short of slabs, and we need products for the
domestic market,'' Zhou said through a Chinese interpreter.
``About half the slabs will go to meet domestic Chinese needs.
The rest will go to the international market or to China if we
need them in the future.''  
 Shanghai-based Baosteel is seeking to expand output abroad
to cut costs and secure supplies of raw materials, while Vale
aims to increase domestic sales of  iron ore , the main steel-
making ingredient. The mill will be Baosteel's first outside of
its home country, and the company has no immediate plan to build
others, Zhao said.  
 The mill at the port of Ubu in Anchieta will produce 5
million metric tons of steel slabs a year, Zhao said. Anchieta
is about 360 kilometers (225 miles) northeast of Rio de Janeiro.  
 It's more cost efficient to ship slabs to China than iron
ore. Ships will carry coal back to Brazil on the return trip,
Zhao said.  
 Vale Investment  
 Vale will hang on to its 20 percent stake for eight to 10
years, said James Pessoa, the Vale executive who will jointly
run the venture. Vale will also invest in a railway and port
facilities.  
 Rio de Janeiro-based Vale is taking minority stakes in
projects like Baosteel's to build up domestic production and
secure long-term contracts for its iron ore, said Gabriel Stoliar, head of new project development for Vale. Vale also has
a 10 percent stake in Cia. Siderurgica do Atlantico, a joint
venture with  Germany 's ThyssenKrupp AG.  
 Baosteel said July 17 it may double production to as much
as 10 million metric tons at the Brazilian plant in order to
meet demand in the South American country.
