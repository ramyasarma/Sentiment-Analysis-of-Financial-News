             U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  pledged to cut the tax rate on company profits,
saying he wants to create the most competitive corporate-tax
regime of any major economy.  
 From April 2011, corporation tax will fall by 1 percentage
point each year over the next four years, taking the rate to 24
percent in 2014, Osborne told Parliament in London in his
emergency budget today. The rate for small companies will fall
to 20 percent in 2011 from 21 percent.  
 With the record budget deficit requiring cuts to public
spending over the next five years, the government is counting on
private companies to take over as the engine of economic growth.
Today’s tax reductions will save companies more than 4 billion
pounds ($6 billion) by April 2015, Treasury documents show.  
 “I want a sign to go up over the British economy, that
says ‘Open for Business,’” Osborne said. “Corporation-tax
rates are compared around the world, and low rates act as
adverts for the countries that introduce them. Our current rate
of 28 pence is looking less and less competitive.”  
 The main corporation-tax rate has fallen from 33 percent
since the last Labour government took office in 1997, with
 Gordon Brown  using his last budget as finance minister in 2007
to cut the levy from 30 percent to its present level.  
 International Comparisons  
 The U.K. rate compares with levels as high as 39 percent in
the U.S., 34 percent in  France  and 30 percent in Germany,
according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.  
 Osborne, whose Conservative Party formed a coalition with
the Liberal Democrats after inconclusive May 6 elections, said
the tax cuts will be partially financed by reducing allowances
for capital spending from 2012.  
 In February, Civitas called for the U.K. corporation-tax
rate to be reduced to 15 percent over the next 10 years to boost
competitiveness. The independent policy-research group said
Britain has failed to keep pace with cuts elsewhere in the OECD,
where the average rate fell to 26.3 percent last year from 37.7
percent in 1996.
