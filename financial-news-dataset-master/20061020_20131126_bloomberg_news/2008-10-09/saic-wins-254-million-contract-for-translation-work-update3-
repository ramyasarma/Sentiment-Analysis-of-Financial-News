             SAIC Inc. (SAI) , the San Diego-based defense
contractor specializing in computer services, said it won a
contract valued at more than $254 million to provide translation
services to the  Defense Intelligence Agency .  
 The six-month award can be extended for a total of four
years, the company said in a statement. The work will be
performed primarily overseas for the National Media Exploitation
