             The Dutch Parliament will wait for
a final proposal on the aid plan for Greece before taking a vote
on the Netherlands’ contribution of as much as 1.8 billion euros
($2.4 billion).  
 Work on the European Union-International Monetary Fund
financing mechanism for Greece has “intensified” and “will be
concluded in early May,” EU spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen
told reporters in Brussels today. German Chancellor Angela
Merkel said yesterday that she won’t release funds until the
Greek government has a “sustainable” plan to cut its deficit.  
 Greece, which has 8.5 billion euros of bonds coming due in
May, last week asked the EU and the IMF to activate the 45
billion-euro emergency funding package. European finance
ministers are seeking swift agreement on the aid program amid
concern that any delay may trigger a further sell-off of Greek
bonds and spread to other markets.  
 Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager today informed
lawmakers in The Hague by telephone “about the developments of
the past days” on the Greek aid plan, spokesman Ruud Slotboom
said by phone. De Jager said on April 15 that he sees
“sufficient parliamentary support” to pass the aid package.
The Parliament will await a final proposal before taking a
decision, Slotboom said today.  
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou requested activation
of the aid mechanism on April 23 after failing to convince
investors the government could tackle the deficit.
