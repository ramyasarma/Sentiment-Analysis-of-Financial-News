             Lazard Ltd., the biggest non-bank
merger adviser, reported its second straight loss on higher
compensation costs and a restructuring charge for staff cuts.  
 The loss for the first three months of 2010 was $33.5
million, or 38 cents a share, compared with a loss of $53.5
million, or 77 cents, in the same period a year earlier, the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said today in a statement.
Adjusted earnings were 46 cents a share, beating the 18-cent
average estimate of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Compensation expenses drove the loss for a second quarter
as Lazard recognized costs related to deferred stock awards and
severance payments. Lazard’s revenue from advising on mergers
and acquisitions climbed from a year earlier even as companies
completed a lower value of deals in the quarter.  
 “Over the last two years, in addition to aggressively
hiring senior bankers, we’ve also right-sized the firm in both
asset management and the financial-advisory business, to make
sure we have the right skill sets for the new world,” Chief
Financial Officer Michael Castellano said in an interview. “I
think we’ve now got the right manpower complement to be able to
drive growth in both of the businesses.”  
 Lazard fell 41 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $38.21 yesterday
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained
28 percent last year after falling 27 percent in 2008.  
 Revenue Increase  
 Operating revenue rose 67 percent from a year earlier to a
first-quarter record of $456.9 million. Operating revenue from
financial-advisory services climbed to $269.1 million as fees
from advising on both mergers and restructuring jumped more than
50 percent.  
 Revenue from merger and acquisition and strategic advisory
climbed 53 percent from a year earlier to $147.6 million. That’s
down 13 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009.  
 Asset management revenue climbed 78 percent from a year
earlier to $183.7 million. Assets under management increased 4
percent to $135 billion from Dec. 31, with net inflows of $3
billion in the quarter.  
 “Both financial advisory and asset management had their
best first quarters ever,” Castellano said. “We’re continuing
to gain global market share in the M&A business.”  
 Compensation costs climbed 35 percent from a year earlier
to $275.5 million. The firm’s compensation ratio fell to 60
percent of revenue, excluding one-time charges, compared with 75
percent in the first quarter of 2009. The firm also recorded a
one-time $87.1 million expense tied to staff reductions.  
 Kenneth Jacobs  
 Kenneth Jacobs was named chief executive officer in
November after the death of Bruce Wasserstein, the preeminent
Wall Street dealmaker who took Lazard public in 2005. Jacobs,
who has worked at the firm for 22 years, had served as deputy
chairman and CEO of North American businesses since 2002,
shortly after Wasserstein arrived.  
 Lazard said last month that Castellano will retire on March
31, 2011. He will be replaced by Matthieu Bucaille, who served
as deputy chief executive officer of Lazard Freres Banque in
Paris.  
 Lazard has been using its restructuring-advisory business
to counter weakness in mergers and acquisitions. It was the
second-ranked adviser in 2009 bankruptcy liquidations, according
to Bloomberg data, and advised debtors or creditors in the top
10 Chapter 11 bankruptcies in 2009.  
 Companies worldwide completed $358.9 billion of deals in
the first quarter, down 25 percent from the same period in 2009
and 52 percent from the first quarter of 2008, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  
 Financial Advice  
 Lazard was the seventh-ranked financial adviser on
announced deals and 12th-ranked on completed takeovers in the
first quarter. The firm advised on completed deals totaling more
than $33.9 billion, including Kraft Foods Inc.’s acquisition of
Cadbury PLC.  
 Lazard employees own more than a quarter of the firm,
excluding the estate of Wasserstein. Because the stakes owned by
employees can be converted into common stock, the company
reports earnings as though the stakes were fully exchanged
instead of treating them as minority interest.  
 Evercore Partners Inc., the investment bank founded by
former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, reported
earnings last week that beat analysts’ estimates as advisory
revenue climbed from a year earlier.
