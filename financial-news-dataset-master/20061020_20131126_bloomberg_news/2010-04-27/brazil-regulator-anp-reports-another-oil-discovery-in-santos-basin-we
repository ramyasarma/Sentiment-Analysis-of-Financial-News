             Brazil’s government found more
evidence of oil at a deepwater well it’s drilling as part of a
plan to swap crude reserves for new shares in state-controlled
Petroleo Brasileiro SA.  
 The find was made in well 2-ANP-1-RJS at a water depth of
1,889 meters (6,198 feet), the National Petroleum Agency, or
ANP, said on its website. The oil regulator announced a previous
find at the same well on March 1.  
 Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based oil producer is
known, is seeking to sell new shares by the end of July and swap
some stock for the rights to 5 billion barrels of government-
owned reserves. The ANP is drilling near the offshore Tupi
field, which may hold as much as 8 billion barrels of reserves,
making it the largest discovery in the Americas since 1976.  
 The ANP may not find 5 billion barrels of reserves at the
first well and plans to start drilling a second well in May,
Florival Carvalho, ANP’s superintendent of planning and
research, said April 14. It may take until mid-June to finish
testing the first well, and an additional two months to test the
second, he said.  
 Petrobras will also use proceeds from its share sale to
help finance as much as $220 billion in investments through
2014, the largest spending plan of any oil company.  
 Petrobras fell 76 centavos, or 2.3 percent, to 32.55 reais
at 4:13 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading. The stock has declined 11
percent this year, more than 2 percent drop for Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index.
