             The rand dropped for the first time
in three days, the worst performer among 15 major currencies, as
commodities fell and concern that Greece’s aid package may be
delayed prompted investors to sell emerging-market assets.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest economy depreciated as
much as 1 percent to 7.40336 per dollar, snapping its biggest
two-day gain in eight weeks. It traded 0.9 percent weaker at
7.3978 by 3:52 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a close of 7.3288
yesterday. Today is a public holiday in South Africa.  
 There will be no decision on aid for Greece until the
International Monetary Fund works out a plan of cuts with the
government in Athens, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
yesterday. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks from 22
developing countries snapped a two-day rally, and copper
declined 1.4 percent, the most in seven days, in London.  
 “It’s not very shocking after a big rally” for the rand
to weaken, said Bartosz Pawlowski, a London-based emerging-
markets strategist at BNP Paribas SA. “There is some correction
in the rand as global markets are generally weak.”  
 South Africa, with more than $2.5 trillion in mineral
reserves, is the world’s richest nation by “commodity wealth”
followed by Russia and Australia, according to research by
Citigroup Inc. Lead, nickel, zinc and aluminum prices also
declined.  
 Government bonds fell, raising the yield on the benchmark
13.5 percent security due September 2015 by half a basis point
to 7.75 percent. The bond’s price lost 3 cents to 124.88 rand.
