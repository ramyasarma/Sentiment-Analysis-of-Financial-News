             Comdirect Bank AG, the German
online broker controlled by Commerzbank AG, said first-quarter
net income climbed 23 percent, helped by higher commission
income and reduced costs.  
 Net income rose to 15.7 million euros ($21 million) from
12.7 million euros in the year-earlier period, the Quickborn-
based company said in an e-mailed statement. Net commission
income advanced 13 percent to 38.8 million euros, while
administrative expenses dropped 8 percent to 48.6 million euros.  
 Comdirect stuck to a target for pretax profit of 150
million euros to 170 million euros by 2013 and to boost the
number of customers to 3 million.
