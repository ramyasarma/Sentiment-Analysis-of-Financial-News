             Airbus SAS unions will hamper
production at Toulouse until April 30 by preventing delivery of
plane sections in support of their demand for a pay rise of 3.5
percent, French daily Les Echos said, without citing anyone.  
 The unions have rejected an offer of 1.9 percent, according
to the newspaper. The Toulouse factory won’t be completely
blocked by the action, Les Echos cited an unidentified spokesman
as saying.
