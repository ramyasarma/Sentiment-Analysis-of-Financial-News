             The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate bonds rose after Greece and
Portugal were downgraded by Standard & Poor’s, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 27 basis
points to 449, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at 4:31
p.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and an increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 7.25 basis points to 96.25,
JPMorgan prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from
default also increased, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index
of 25 banks and insurers up 18 at 134.25, the highest since May,
and the subordinated index 14 higher at 195.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
