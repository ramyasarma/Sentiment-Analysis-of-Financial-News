             A rally in Malaysia’s government
bonds that has pushed yields to the lowest levels this year
makes it attractive to receive fixed interest rates via swaps
contracts, according to RHB Research Institute.  
 Three-year yields have slid 27 basis points in 2010 as
overseas investors bought local debt to profit from a rally in
the ringgit, Asia’s best-performing currency. Fund inflows will
push yields and swap rates lower over the next four weeks as the
central bank is unlikely to raise borrowing costs before July,
RHB predicted in a research note yesterday.  
 The gap between three-year yields and swap rates is at a
six-month high of 45 basis points and may narrow to about 30 to
35 basis points, Kuala Lumpur-based RHB forecasts.  
 “The downward pressure on yields may cause swaps to follow
suit,” according to RHB, a unit of Malaysia’s fourth-largest
lender, RHB Capital Bhd. The bond-swap spread “indicates the
three-year interest-rate swap is cheap,” it said.  
 RHB recommends receiving the three-year swap at 3.379
percent as it may track a 10- to 15 basis-point drop in
benchmark yields over the next four weeks.  
 The ringgit reached 3.1710 per dollar yesterday, the
strongest level since May 8, 2008, and was at 3.1858 as of 11:05
a.m. in Kuala Lumpur. The currency has rallied 7.6 percent
against the dollar and 15.8 percent versus the euro this year.  
 Overseas investors increased holdings of government bonds
in Malaysia for an eighth straight month in February to a total
of 47 billion ringgit ($14.8 billion), the highest level since
May 2008, according to Bank Negara Malaysia data. Foreign funds
may step up purchases of government bonds to 70 billion ringgit
by year-end, RHB said in a report on April 7.  
 Rate Outlook  
 The 3.21 percent bond due in May 2013 yielded 2.97 percent
yesterday, according to Bursa Malaysia. It may drop to 2.85
percent, making the securities a “trading buy,” RHB said in
the report.  
 Interest-rate swaps are agreements in which investors
exchange fixed payments for floating rates or vice a versa. The
variable rate is tied to a three-month interbank offered rate,
or Klibor, in Malaysia.  
 Slower inflation will allow the central bank to delay its
next interest-rate increase until July at the earliest, RHB
predicts. Policy makers next meet on May 13.  
 Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in March from a year
earlier, versus 1.2 percent in February, the government said on
April 23. Economists had forecast a 1.5 percent gain.  
 Bank Negara raised its overnight rate to 2.25 percent on
March 4 from a record-low 2 percent. Policy makers may increase
the rate to 3 percent by the end of the second quarter of next
year, according to the median estimate of 12 economists in a
Bloomberg survey, with the most recent forecasts given the
heaviest weightings.
