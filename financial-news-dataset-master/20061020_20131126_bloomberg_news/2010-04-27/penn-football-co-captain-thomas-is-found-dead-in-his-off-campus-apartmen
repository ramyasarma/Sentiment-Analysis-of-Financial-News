             University of Pennsylvania football
co-captain Owen Thomas was found dead yesterday afternoon at his
off-campus apartment.  
 No foul play is suspected, said university spokeswoman Lori
Doyle.  
 Thomas, a 21-year-old junior defensive end from Allentown,
Pennsylvania, who was enrolled in the Wharton School, was named
second-team All-Ivy League last season and was one of four
players at the Philadelphia school who was elected captain for
the 2010 season.  
 It’s the second time in five years the football program has
had to deal with a player death, according to the
Philadelphia Inquirer. Kyle Ambrogi, a senior running back from
Havertown, Pennsylvania, committed suicide on Oct. 10, 2005.  
 “The Penn football family is deeply saddened today with
the news of the sudden death of one of our shining lights,”
Penn Coach Al Bagnoli said in a statement. “Owen was a
remarkable young man, a true scholar-athlete, an ambassador for
Penn, a tremendous teammate and leader on and off the field.”  
 Thomas, 6-foot-2 and 240 pounds, helped lead Penn to the
2009 Ivy League championship and finished second in the league
with six quarterback sacks.
