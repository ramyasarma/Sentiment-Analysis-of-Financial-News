             Swedbank AB said that in the three
Baltic countries, where it is the largest lender, it is likely
to return to profit in Estonia first, declining to say when that
may be. The likelihood that Estonia will join the eurozone in
January 2011 has increased, Chief Executive Officer Michael Wolf
said in a telephone conference with journalists today.
