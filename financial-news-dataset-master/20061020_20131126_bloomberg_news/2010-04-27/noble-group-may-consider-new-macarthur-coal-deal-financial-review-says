             Noble Group Ltd. may be considering
making a new approach to Macarthur Coal Ltd. as early as this
week, the Australian Financial Review reported in its Street
Talk column without saying where it got the information. A
proposed deal that would have seen Noble become Macarthur’s
largest shareholder was rejected by Noble shareholders.
Macarthur is in talks with Peabody Energy Corp., which made a
A$4.1 billion cash offer for the company.
