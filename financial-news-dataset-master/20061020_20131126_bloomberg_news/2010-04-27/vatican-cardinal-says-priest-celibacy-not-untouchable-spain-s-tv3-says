             The Roman Catholic Church is open
to discussing whether priests must remain celibate, Cardinal
Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican’s second-in-command, told Spain’s
channel TV3 in an interview.  
 Celibacy is not “untouchable” and some Catholic priests
in the church’s Greek-rite tradition lead married lives, the
Vatican secretary of state told the Catalan-language station in
an interview posted on its Web site today. Still, the centuries-
old celibacy rule remains “a positive and fruitful tradition.”  
 The Vatican is struggling to respond to a wave of child
sex-abuse allegations against priests in several countries,
including Pope Benedict XVI’s native Germany. Austrian Cardinal
Christoph Schonborn wrote in March that there may be a link
between celibacy and pedophilia by priests. Bertone said there’s
no direct connection between celibacy and “the deviant behavior
of certain priests,” according to an April 25 interview he gave
to Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia.  
 The Vatican on March 12 denied it’s secretly planning to
scrap the rule of priestly celibacy within 50 years. The denial
came after Italian newspaper la Repubblica reported the Church
is studying ways to loosen the requirement that priests abstain
from sexual activity in an effort to rebuild its image in the
wake of the sex-abuse scandals.
