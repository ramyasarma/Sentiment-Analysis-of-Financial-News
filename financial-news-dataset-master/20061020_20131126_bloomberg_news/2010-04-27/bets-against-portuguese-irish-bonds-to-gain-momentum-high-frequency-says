             Investors will add to bets against
the bonds of European nations including Portugal and Ireland
unless governments find a way to ease concern that they won’t be
able to service their debt, High Frequency Economics said.  
 “Unless the governments come up with some meaningful way
to assuage investor concerns, we think speculation against bond
markets in Portugal and Ireland will continue to gain momentum
after yesterday’s sell-off,” Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist
in Valhalla, New York, wrote in an investor note today. “Things
also stand to deteriorate in Italy and Spain,” he said. “We
advocate multiyear restructuring of bond obligations now, before
markets seize up with unknowable consequences.”
