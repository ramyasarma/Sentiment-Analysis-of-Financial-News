             Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak
said Syria has provided rockets and missiles to the Hezbollah
militia in Lebanon that pose a threat to stability in the
region.  
 “We do not intend to provoke any kind of major collision
in Lebanon or with Syria but are watching closely these
developments,” Barak said at a joint press conference at the
Pentagon with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates.  
 Gates said both Syria and Iran are giving Hezbollah weapons
of “ever-increasing capability” and “this is obviously
destabilizing for the whole region.”
