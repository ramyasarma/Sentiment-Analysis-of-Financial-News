             U.S. stock-index futures declined,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will fall for a
second day, amid concern European Union assistance won’t stop
Greece’s debt crisis from spreading.  
 Futures on the S&P 500 expiring in June dropped 0.3 percent
to 1,204.6 as of 11:11 a.m. in London.
