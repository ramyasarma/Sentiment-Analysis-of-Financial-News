             The medium-term outlook for the
euro remains “extremely challenging” because of risks the
Greek debt crisis persists and extends to other countries in the
region, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 Regardless of how Greece “is resolved in the short term,
investors will remain underweight euro for the foreseeable
future and a short-covering rally on a short-term resolution
would be limited,” Greg Gibbs, a currency strategist in Sydney,
wrote today in a report. The euro is “defying gravity,” which
is “at odds with European sovereign debt markets,” he said.  
 The euro traded little changed at $1.3376 as of 7:35 a.m.
in London.
