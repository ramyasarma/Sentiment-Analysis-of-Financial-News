             Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
facing fraud allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, has the worst-performing actively traded corporate
bonds from a benchmark offering this year.  
 Goldman Sachs’s 5.375 percent bonds due 2020 have fallen
3.9 cents on the dollar since being issued on March 1 to 95.9
cents as of 9:52 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The debt yields 2.17 percentage points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries.  
 The debt has declined 5.18 cents since April 15, the day
before the SEC said New York-based Goldman Sachs created and
sold securities linked to subprime mortgages in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson & Co. helped pick the underlying loans and bet against
the vehicles.  
 Goldman Sachs executives, including Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, are scheduled to appear today
before a Senate subcommittee. The SEC’s allegations “are
completely unfounded in law and fact and we will vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation,” Goldman
Sachs said April 16 in a statement.  
 Financial company bonds yielded 1.93 percentage points more
than benchmarks as of yesterday, an increase of 0.07 percentage
point from April 15, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s U.S. Financial Corporate Index.  
 Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the bonds.  
 Benchmark offerings are typically at least $500 million.
