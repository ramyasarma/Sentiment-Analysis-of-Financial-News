             CBH Resources Ltd., an Australian
lead and zinc mining company, rose 12 percent in Sydney after
recommending shareholders accept a takeover from Japan’s Toho
Zinc Co. that’s higher than an offer from Nyrstar NV.  
 Toho, which holds 24 percent of CBH, offered to buy all of
Sydney-based CBH’s shares at 24 cents apiece and its convertible
notes for A$1,000 each, or 100 percent of their issue price,
valuing CBH’s shares and notes at about A$361 million ($333
million), the company said today in a statement. CBH closed at
23 cents on the Australian stock exchange, the highest since
June 19, 2008.  
 The bid trumps an offer of 19.5 cents a share from Balen,
Belgium-based Nyrstar, the world’s largest zinc producer, which
valued CBH’s shares and notes at A$311 million. Toho earlier
offered to raise its holding in CBH, which controls the Rasp
lead and zinc project, to 49.9 percent by paying 30 cents a
share.  
 Toho’s latest offer needs acceptance from holders of 90
percent of CBH stock to be accepted, CBH said.
