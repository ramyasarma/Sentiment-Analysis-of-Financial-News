             Former Colombian President Ernesto
Samper said he knew of a plot involving presidential candidate
Juan Manuel Santos to overthrow his government, Caracol Radio
reported.  
 Samper said Santos was part of a coalition involving
paramilitaries, drug traffickers and guerrillas that tried to
“bring down” his 1994 to 1998 government, according to an
interview with Bogota’s Caracol radio.  
 Santos is the “sweet cream on the poisoned cake,” said
Samper, was investigated by Colombia’s chief prosecutor while in
office for receiving $6 million in campaign donations from the
Cali drug cartel. He was cleared of any wrongdoing by Congress.  
 A spokeswoman for Santos, who heads the ticket for the La
U party, declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg.
