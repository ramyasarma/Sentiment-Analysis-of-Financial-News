             Southwest Airlines Co., the largest
low-fare air carrier, was fined $200,000 for failing to comply
with federal rules for bumping passengers from flights, the U.S.
Transportation Department said.  
 Federal rules require airlines with oversold flights to
seek volunteers willing to give up their seats for pay.
Passengers who are bumped involuntarily are entitled to a
payment of as much as $800, must be given a written statement as
to their rights and told how the carrier decides who to remove
from a flight, the agency said.  
 The department assessed the fine after passenger complaints
and an inspection at the Dallas-based airline’s headquarters,
the agency said in the statement today.  
 The Transportation Department in 2008 doubled the payments
passengers get for being involuntarily bumped, which was the
first increase since 1978.
