             Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid
said he’s ready to move forward with a climate-change bill
before taking up the issue of overhauling U.S. immigration laws.  
 “The energy bill is ready, we will move that more quickly
than a bill we don’t have,” Reid told reporters today in
Washington. “I don’t have an immigration bill.”  
 Reid said he told Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina last week that he wanted to proceed with climate-
change legislation before taking up immigration. Graham, working
on both issues, pulled out of talks to proceed with a global-
warming bill on April 24 to protest that President Barack Obama
and Senate leaders may act first on immigration laws.  
 “I don’t know why Senator Graham has decided that he wants
out of what he’s doing,” Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said.  
 Immigration and energy are “equally vital” to economic
and national security, Reid said. “We’ve ignored both of them
for far too long. I’m committed to doing both this session of
Congress.”
