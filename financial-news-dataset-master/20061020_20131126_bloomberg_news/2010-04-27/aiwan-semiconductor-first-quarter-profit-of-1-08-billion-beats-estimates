             Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co., the world’s No. 1 contract manufacturer of chips, forecast
record revenue after posting profit that beat analyst estimates
on rising demand for components used in computers, handsets and
games machines.  
 Revenue this quarter will be NT$100 billion ($3.2 billion)
to NT$102 billion, Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told
investors today in Taipei. The average estimate of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for revenue of NT$97.2 billion. First-
quarter net income was NT$33.7 billion, surpassing the NT$30.6
billion average of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Taiwan Semiconductor, which makes components used in Apple
Inc. iPhones and Sony Corp. games consoles, is seen as a
bellwether for the chip industry because its products are used
in a broad range of electronics products. The company joins
clients including Texas Instruments Inc. and STMicroelectronics
NV in forecasting sales this quarter that surpass estimates.  
 “We’ve got a lot of new product cycles, whether it’s a
tablet, a smartphone, or a flat-panel,” said Steven Pelayo, an
analyst at HSBC Holdings PLC in Hong Kong. “End demand has been
stronger than expected just about everywhere.” He rates Taiwan
Semiconductor “neutral”  
 First-quarter consolidated revenue more than doubled to
NT$92.2 billion, exceeding the company’s forecast for NT$89
billion to NT$91 billion and the NT$90 billion average of 17
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 ‘Very Positive’  
 TSMC climbed 0.3 percent to close at NT$63.70 in Taipei
before the earnings announcement. The stock has lost 1.2 percent
this year, compared with a 0.5 percent decline in the benchmark
Taiex index.  
 “Customers are very positive and the overall macroeconomic
environment is improving,” said Dan Heyler, an analyst at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch, who rates TSMC “neutral.”  
 Taiwan Semiconductor Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Morris Chang today raised his outlook for the global PC industry
to 17 percent growth, from an earlier 14 percent forecast, and
said the market for handsets will climb 13 percent from last
year, compared with a previous 12 percent estimate.  
 “Handsets, PCs and digital products are all growing quite
strongly,” Chang said today. The stronger full-year outlook
means quarter-to-quarter growth will be “below seasonality,”
which doesn’t reflect a weaker overall market, he said.  
 Industry Revenue  
 Chang, 78, raised his outlook for global chip-industry
revenue growth this year to 22 percent, from a January estimate
of 18 percent, and forecast a 7 percent expansion next year,
deputy spokesman J.H. Tzeng said April 14. The custom chip-
making market, about half of which TSMC controls, will climb 36
percent, Chang said today, compared with an earlier forecast for
29 percent.  
 Texas Instruments, the second-largest U.S. chipmaker,
yesterday said sales this quarter would be at least $3.31
billion, more than the $3.23 billion average of analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  
 STMicroelectronics, Europe’s largest chipmaker, on April 22
posted a 40 percent rise in first-quarter revenue to $2.33
billion, as sales of chips used in washing machines and
television set-top-boxes climbed.  
 Intel Corp., the world’s largest chipmaker, on April 13
forecast second-quarter sales of $10.2 billion, plus or minus
$400 million, compared with an average $9.72 billion estimate of
34 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Gross margin, a key industry measure, which tracks the
percentage of sales left after deducting cost of goods sold, was
47.9 percent for the first quarter, worse than the 48.1 percent
average of seven analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey,
and in line with the company’s forecast for 46.5 percent to 48.5
percent.  
 Gross margin will be 48 percent to 50 percent this quarter,
compared with the 48.8 percent average of seven analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.

                          April 27 (Bloomberg) -- Doug Freedman, an analyst at Broadpoint AmTech Inc., talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li about Texas Instruments Inc.'s performance and growth outlook.
     Texas Instruments, the second-largest U.S. chipmaker, predicted sales and profit that topped analysts’ estimates, helped by demand for semiconductors used in industrial machinery, phone networks and cars. Freedman, speaking from San Francisco, also discusses the outlook for Intel Corp. and the semiconductor industry. (Source: Bloomberg)
