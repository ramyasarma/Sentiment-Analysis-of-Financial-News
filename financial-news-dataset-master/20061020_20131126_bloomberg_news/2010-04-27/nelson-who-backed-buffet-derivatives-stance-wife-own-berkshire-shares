             Senator Ben Nelson, who supported
an exemption to proposed derivatives rules sought by Warren
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., owned as much as $6 million
worth of stock with his wife in the Omaha, Nebraska-based
company, financial disclosures show.  
 A Nebraska Democrat, Nelson reported last year that he
owned between $500,000 and $1 million of stock in Berkshire in
2008, and his wife owned between $1 million and $5 million.
Senators report their holdings each year in broad ranges. New
financial disclosure reports are due May 15.  
 Nelson and his wife, Diane, owned more shares in Berkshire
than any other member of Congress, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group.  
 The senator, 68, said his ownership of stock in Berkshire,
a Nebraska company with “probably hundreds of thousands of
shareholders,” didn’t pose a conflict of interest or an
appearance of ethical impropriety. He said he had owned the
stock since before he became governor and his wife had been a
Berkshire stockholder for 30 years.  
 “It doesn’t influence my decision at all; never has, never
will,” said Nelson, who was governor from 1991-1999.  
 Berkshire sought a provision that would exempt previously
written derivatives contracts from proposed rules on collateral,
according to a Democratic aide speaking on condition of
anonymity. Berkshire owns derivatives tied to about $63 billion
in assets.  
 Main Street Concerns  
 Asked whether the derivatives issue would cause him to vote
against the financial overhaul legislation, Nelson said, “I am
looking to be in favor of the bill, I just want to make sure it
does in fact deal with the Wall Street issues and not overextend
to deal with Main Street issues that are not part of the
problem.”  
 Nelson said earlier today that he and his staff spoke with
Berkshire Hathaway representatives, not Buffett, “all along the
way” in order “to understand the issue and why it’s
important.”  
 He told reporters that he is “hopeful that these matters
will be taken care of,” because “you can’t take property.”
The legislation has “got to be done right or it’s not going to
stand up” to legal challenges, he said.  
 The Berkshire-sought provision isn’t in the legislation
that Senate Democrats have tried for two days to bring up for
debate. Nelson was the only member of his party to support the
Republicans in blocking consideration of the measure in votes
today and yesterday.  
 Republican Mike Johanns, Nebraska’s other senator, is
seeking the same exemption to the proposed derivatives rules.
