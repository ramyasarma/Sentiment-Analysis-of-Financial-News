             Brazilian policy makers are poised
to raise borrowing costs at the fastest pace since President
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office in 2003 after central bank
chief Henrique Meirelles pledged “vigorous action” on
inflation, the futures market shows.
     The biggest two-day surge in six months on yields of the
overnight interest rate futures contract due in July reflects
expectations that Meirelles will raise the benchmark Selic rate
2.25 percentage points to 11 percent by the June policy meeting,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield gap between
the July 2010 and January 2021 futures shrank to the narrowest
since August today on bets higher borrowing costs now will make
it possible to avoid more increases in years ahead.  
 Investors drove up fixed-rate bond yields on concern the
central bank won’t raise rates fast enough to rein in inflation
after Meirelles, 64, held the rate at a record low 8.75 percent
last month as he considered a run for elected office. Yesterday
he called on the next government to be “very serious” in
fighting rising prices, and in an April 25 interview said the
bank was ready to “take the necessary measures” to keep the
economy from overheating.  
 “There has been some flip-flopping by the central bank and
the statements were confusing,” said Kieran Curtis, who manages
about $2 billion in fixed-income emerging-market assets
including Brazilian bonds at Aviva Investors in London. “If
they feel they need to move aggressively, they will.”  
 Inflation Pick-Up  
 Inflation in the year though mid-April accelerated to an
11-month high of 5.2 percent, above the government’s 4.5 percent
target. Economists predict inflation will end the year at 5.4
percent, according to a central bank survey published yesterday.  
 Yields on the interest-rate futures contract due in July
rose seven basis points yesterday to 9.52 percent, the highest
level since June, following a six basis-point jump on April 23.
They fell one basis point to 9.51 percent today.  
 The increase in the July contract reflects expectations
policy makers will raise the benchmark Selic rate 75 basis
points, or 0.75 percentage point, at their two-day meeting that
starts today and at each of the next two meetings, Bloomberg
data show.  
 2021 Contracts  
 The yield on contracts maturing in January 2021 fell 27
basis points in the past three days to 12.54 percent as traders
bet higher interest rates will contain inflation expectations in
years ahead.  
 The yield gap between the January 2021 and July 2010
contracts narrowed to 3.03 percentage points today, the smallest
difference in at least eight months, from 4.1 percentage points
at the end of last year.  
 Brazil’s real fell 1.4 percent today to 1.7713 per dollar,
its first drop in three days, as credit-rating downgrades of
Greece and Portugal spurred investors to reduce holding of
higher-yielding assets.  
 Finance Minister Guido Mantega said in New York yesterday
that the government may take more measures to limit gains in the
currency. The real hasn’t traded beyond 1.69 per dollar since
October, when the government levied a 2 percent tax on foreign
purchases of stocks and bonds to arrest the currency’s
appreciation. The real will end the year at 1.75 per dollar,
according to the median forecast of 17 economists.  
 Dollar Bonds  
 The extra yield investors demand to own Brazilian dollar-
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries widened 18 basis points today
to 1.94 percentage points, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.
indexes. The yield gap touched 1.67 percentage points on April
15, the narrowest since October 2007. The average spread for
emerging-market dollar debt overall swelled 21 basis points to
2.64 percentage points.  
 The cost of protecting Brazilian bonds against default for
five years rose 11 basis points to 129 basis points, according
to CMA DataVision prices. The cost dropped to 110 basis points
on April 15, the lowest in seven months.  
 Marfrig Alimentos SA, the world’s fourth-largest
meatpacker, plans to sell 10-year dollar bonds as soon as this
week to take advantage of falling borrowing costs, a person
familiar with the transaction said yesterday. The yield on the
Brazilian company’s 9.625 percent note due in 2016 dropped 0.83
percentage point to 8.69 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 Rising Inflation  
 Traders’ expectations for inflation have surged since the
March 17 policy meeting where the central bank’s decision
surprised more than half of the 57 analysts who predicted an
increase in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Yields on government 10 percent fixed-rate bonds due 2013
climbed 64 basis points to 12.66 percent since the meeting. The
yield on the inflation-linked bond due that year fell 35 basis
points in the first 15 days after the decision to 6.2 percent
before climbing to 6.81 percent today. The gap between the two
securities touched the widest since January 2008 on April 23.  
 Investors are pricing in too many interest-rate increases
and betting on a further advance in bond yields would be
unprofitable, said Guillermo Osses, who helps oversee $50
billion in emerging-market assets at Newport Beach, California-
based Pacific Investment Management Co., manager of the world’s
biggest bond fund.  
 ‘Target Band’  
 “This has been one of the central banks in the world that
has been able to keep inflation within its target band,” said
Osses, who predicted the central bank will raise the Selic by 50
basis points tomorrow and by 3 percentage points at most by mid-
2011.  
 Policy makers haven’t lifted the benchmark rate by as much
as 2.25 percentage points in a three-month period since raising
it 4.5 percent percentage points between December 2002 and
February 2003. Lula, 64, who steps down at the end of this year,
took office that January.  
 “If they go for 50 basis points now rather than 75, the
risk is that market expectations for inflation continue to
worsen,” said Marcelo Carvalho, chief Brazil economist for
Morgan Stanley, who raised his forecast for growth this year to
6.8 percent from 5.8 percent. “Then the central bank finds
itself forced later on to do more than it may have planned
initially.”
