             Anthony Kim said he will miss 2-3
months of the U.S. PGA Tour season after thumb surgery.  
 “It’s going to happen, it’s just a matter of when,” Kim
said in a news conference today in Charlotte, North Carolina,
site of this week’s Quail Hollow Championship. “The doctor told
me when the pain gets too hard to deal with, that’s when I
should do it.”  
 Kim said he’s trying to lock up a spot on the U.S. team for
the Ryder Cup, scheduled for Oct. 1-3 in Wales, before
scheduling surgery. Kim has a detached ligament at the base of
his left thumb, an injury he said has been bothering him for
about 16 months,  
 While he’s second behind Phil Mickelson in the team point
standings, he would lose valuable points if he skips any of the
season’s three remaining major tournaments -- the U.S. Open in
June, British Open in July and the PGA Championship in August.
The top eight in points plus four captain’s picks make the U.S.
team.  
 “We play four majors a year, but we only play one Ryder
Cup every two years,” said Kim, who finished third at the
Masters Tournament this month. “That event is very special to
me.”
