             Palm oil fell for the first time in
four days as the outlook for substitution demand eased after its
discount to rival soybean oil narrowed.  
 Palm oil for July delivery dropped 0.2 percent to 2,554
ringgit ($800) a metric ton at 3:40 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur,
declining from an 11-day high yesterday on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange.  
 “With soy inventories in 2010-11 expected to reach near-
record levels and the discount between crude palm oil and soy
oil quite narrow currently, we see limited upside to crude palm
oil prices in 2010,” said Sunaina Dhanuka, a plantation analyst
at Macquarie Securities in Kuala Lumpur.  
 Soybean oil in Chicago for July delivery gained 0.5 percent
to 39.95 cents a pound. That put its premium over palm oil at
$80.49 a ton, according to Bloomberg data, which compares with
the past 12-month average of $130.63. The premium was at its
narrowest in three weeks at yesterday’s close, spurring today’s
gains in soybean oil.  
 The U.S., Brazil and Argentina, the largest producers of
soybeans, will contribute to a record crop this year. Soybeans
are crushed for meal for animal feed and oil for cooking and
biofuels.  
 Palm oil, the cheapest feedstock for biofuels, also tracked
crude oil lower. The world’s most-consumed edible oil has
tracked crude oil’s weekly movements for the past 11 weeks.
Crude oil in New York for June delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
$83.64 a barrel at 3:50 p.m. Singapore time.  
 In China, palm oil traded in Dalian rose for a third day,
rising 0.2 percent at 7,010 yuan ($1,027) a ton.
