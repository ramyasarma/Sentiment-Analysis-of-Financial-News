             PetroChina Co., Asia’s biggest
company by market value, posted a 71 percent jump in first-
quarter profit, beating estimates, as demand in the world’s
fastest-growing major economy surged and oil prices rebounded.  
 Net income rose to 32.5 billion yuan ($4.8 billion), or
0.18 yuan a share, from 18.97 billion yuan, or 0.10 yuan, a year
earlier, PetroChina said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. That’s better than a median estimate of 30.9
billion yuan in a Bloomberg survey of six analysts.  
 PetroChina increased first-quarter production to help
supply the world’s biggest car market and factories meeting
overseas orders for Chinese-made goods. The Beijing-based
company also benefited from the more than doubling in oil prices
from last year’s low in February.  
 “PetroChina is in a strong position to increase profit
this year, especially if oil prices remain high and it maintains
this kind of production,” said Neil Beveridge, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. in Hong Kong. “These are a very
strong set of numbers and they are well above estimates.”  
 First-quarter crude oil output rose 2.1 percent to 210
million barrels, with realized prices up 89 percent to $70 a
barrel, China’s biggest energy company said in its earnings
statement. Natural gas production climbed 17 percent to 610
billion cubic feet.  
 The nation’s oil demand may increase 5 percent this year,
China National Petroleum Corp., PetroChina’s state-controlled
parent, said in February. The unit’s profit may rise by a third
to 138.2 billion yuan in 2010, according to a median estimate of
14 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Consumption Rises  
 The shares rose 37 percent in Hong Kong trading in the past
12 months, compared with the 43 percent gain in the benchmark
Hang Seng index. PetroChina retreated 1.4 percent to HK$9.10
today, before the earnings announcement.  
 PetroChina also gained from government-set increases in
oil-product prices that rose an average of 26 percent compared
with the first quarter of last year, said Grace Liu, an energy
analyst at Guotai Junan Securities in Shenzhen.  
 The government last raised gasoline and diesel prices by as
much as 4.6 percent on April 14. China has now adjusted prices
10 times since introducing a mechanism in December 2008 that
allows the state to revise prices when crude-oil costs change
more than 4 percent over 22 working days.  
 PetroChina’s first-quarter fuel sales climbed 27 percent to
27.05 million metric tons as crude oil processing rose 16
percent to 215 million barrels.  
 Overseas Acquisitions  
 The Chinese economy grew 11.9 percent in the first three
months, the fastest in almost three years. PetroChina’s revenue
jumped 75 percent to 318.8 billion yuan during the period.  
 To help meet domestic demand, PetroChina plans to spend at
least $60 billion in the next decade on overseas acquisitions.
The company and Royal Dutch Shell Plc last month agreed to pay
A$3.5 billion ($3.2 billion) for the Australian gas producer
Arrow Energy Ltd.  
 The scale of operations continued to expand in the first
quarter and PetroChina achieved “rapid growth” in its overseas
oil and gas business, the company said in the earnings statement.  
 PetroChina wants half its oil and gas output to come from
overseas by 2020, Chairman Jiang Jiemin said in an interview on
March 25. Less than a tenth of production now comes from abroad.  
 Twenty out of 33 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg rate
PetroChina shares as a buy. Five rate the stock as a sell.
