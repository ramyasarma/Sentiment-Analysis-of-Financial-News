             Indophil Resources NL, the takeover
target of China’s Zijin Mining Group Co., said Chinese
regulatory approval for the offer is taking longer than expected.  
 The A$545 million ($504 million) bid will be extended to
May 14, Melbourne-based Indophil, a mining company, said in a
statement to the Australian stock exchange today.  
 “Some of the offer conditions have already been signed off
by Zijin, with some key conditions remaining,” Indophil said.
“Approval of the offer by Chinese regulatory authorities has
been slower than Indophil and its shareholders expected.”  
 Zijin in December agreed to buy Indophil Resources to gain
a stake in Southeast Asia’s largest untapped copper and gold
deposit. Gold consumption in China may double in the next 10
years, boosting prices as supplies fail to keep pace with
“insatiable appetite,” the World Gold Council said in March.  
 Zijin Mining dropped 1.9 percent to HK$6.16 at 12:29 p.m.
in Hong Kong trading. Indophil Resources rose 1.8 percent to
A$1.165 in Sydney. Zijin had bid A$1.28 a share.  
 “The bid is being reviewed and in the approving process,”
Zhao Jugang, head of board secretary office at Zijin, said today
by phone.
