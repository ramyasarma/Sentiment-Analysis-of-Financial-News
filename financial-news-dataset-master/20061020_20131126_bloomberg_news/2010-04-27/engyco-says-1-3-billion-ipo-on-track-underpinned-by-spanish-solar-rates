             Engyco said it’s pushing ahead to
raise as much as 1 billion euros ($1.33 billion) in a initial
stock offering, supported by a new report on rates paid in Spain
for solar power.  
 The Jersey-based company told Bloomberg New Energy Finance
in an e-mailed statement that the IPO “is not being
postponed,” refuting an April 25 report in the Observer
newspaper.  
 A roadshow with investors is “ongoing and there has been
good investor feedback,” said Archie Berens, a spokesman for
Engyco at Pelham Bell Pottinger, a public relations firm. The
company had never set a firm date for the IPO, only a rough
target of late April or early May.  
 Yesterday, Spanish industry minister Miguel Sebastian said
the government had not considered making cuts to solar feed-in
tariff “retroactive.”  
 The statement eased investors’ concerns that the new
tariffs will reduce the return on existing Spanish solar and
wind assets. Newspapers and investment bank analysts had
speculated the tariff reductions might affect both new
photovoltaic projects and those already getting above-market
rates for electricity they generate.  
 “Clearly the statement by the Spanish industry minister is
good news and underpins Engyco’s confidence,” Berens said.  
 Engyco is led by Alexander Voigt, the founder of Solon SE
and Q-Cells SE, former United Utilities Group Plc Chief
Executive John Roberts and former Solon Chief Executive Thomas
Krupke.
