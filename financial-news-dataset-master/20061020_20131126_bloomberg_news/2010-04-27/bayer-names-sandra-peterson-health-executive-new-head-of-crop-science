             Bayer AG named the first woman to
its top management, selecting former diabetes division head
Sandra Peterson to run the crop treatments unit.  
 Peterson, 51, will replace Friedrich Berschauer on Oct. 1,
Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer said in an e-mailed statement
today.  
 Her appointment continues a management shakeup at the
German drugs and chemicals company, whose three business units
produce fertilizers and other chemicals for plants, plastics and
medicines. Peterson will join a new team of top managers being
created for designated chief executive officer Marijn Dekkers.  
 Dekkers will succeed Werner Wenning on Oct. 1 to become the
first outsider to lead the 147-year old German company. Former
Novartis AG executive Joerg Reinhardt was named to lead Bayer’s
drugs division on April 21.  
 As head of Bayer’s Medical Care unit, Peterson worked to
revive the company’s blood glucose meter business, introducing
Didget, the first glucose meter to plug into a game console for
children.
