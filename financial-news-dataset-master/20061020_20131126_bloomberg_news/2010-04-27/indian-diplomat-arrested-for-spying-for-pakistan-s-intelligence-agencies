             A diplomat working for the Indian
embassy in Islamabad was arrested for spying for Pakistan’s
intelligence agencies, the Press Trust of India reported, citing
officials it didn’t name.  
 The diplomat was arrested last week after she was summoned
by India’s foreign ministry, the news agency said.  
 “We have reasons to believe that an official in the High
Commission of India in Pakistan had been passing information to
Pakistani intelligence agencies,” Vishnu Prakash, spokesman for
India’s foreign ministry, said in a statement today. “The
matter is currently under investigation.”
