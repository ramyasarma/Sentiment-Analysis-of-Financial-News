             Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was
little changed at 4,880 at the close of trading in Sydney. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.4 percent to 3,291.91 in
Wellington.  
 The following were among the most active shares in the
market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company
names.  
 Australia:  
 CSL Ltd. (CSL AU), the world’s second-biggest maker of
treatments made from blood, fell 4.2 percent to A$32.50 after
Credit Suisse Group AG cut the stock to “neutral” from
“outperform,” citing the impact of U.S. health-care reforms.  
 Today’s share loss follows a 7.3 percent drop on April 23,
when CSL last traded, after larger rival Baxter International
Inc. cut its 2010 earnings forecast, saying the U.S. overhaul
will trim full-year profit.  
 Gunns Ltd. (GNS AU), Australia’s biggest woodchip exporter,
rose 3.8 percent to 54.5 Australian cents following a market
update in which the company said John Gay will retire as
director and chairman ahead of the company’s annual meeting in
November.  
 Infigen Energy (IFN AU), the Australian wind power producer
formerly known as Babcock & Brown Wind Partners, tumbled 15
percent to A$1.025 after scrapping a plan to sell its U.S.
business.  
 Nexus Energy Ltd. (NXS AU) declined 9.2 percent to 29.5
Australian cents after the company said gas production from the
Longtom field has ceased.  
 New Zealand:  
 Fisher & Paykel Appliances Holdings Ltd. (FPA NZ), the
appliance maker part-owned by China’s Haier Corp., rose 5.1
percent to 62 New Zealand cents. Rival Whirlpool Corp. yesterday
raised its earnings forecast after reporting a 7 percent
increase in first-quarter sales in the U.S., Fisher & Paykel’s
third-largest market.  
 New Zealand Windfarms Ltd. (NWF NZ), operator of the Te
Rere Hau project near Palmerston North, rose 8.7 percent to 25
New Zealand cents. Nine-month revenue increased tenfold from a
year earlier to NZ$3.1 million, the Christchurch-based company
reported today.  
 Telecom Corp. (TEL NZ), New Zealand’s biggest telephone
company, dropped 0.5 percent to NZ$2.19 after Communications
Minister Steven Joyce said he asked the country’s
telecommunications regulator to review a recommendation that
price controls aren’t necessary.
