             A U.S. unit of AstraZeneca Plc, the
U.K.’s No. 2 drugmaker, accused nine rivals of patent
infringement over plans to market a generic version of the
cholesterol-control drug Crestor.  
 Among the defendants are units of Israel’s Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world’s largest generic-drug
maker, and Switzerland’s Novartis AG, according to complaints
made public today in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  
 AstraZeneca businesses “will be substantially and
irreparably harmed” by the infringement “unless those
activities are precluded by this court,” the company said in
its complaint. The patents expire in 2018 and 2022.  
 Crestor logged $4.5 billion in sales last year, according
to Bloomberg data. The medicine has been prescribed for more
than 19 million patients, with more than 240 million
prescriptions worldwide, the company said in the lawsuit.  
 Also sued were units of Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., Apotex Inc.,
Par Pharmaceutical Co., Mylan Inc., Glenmark Pharmaceuticals
Ltd., Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Sun Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd.  
 AstraZeneca American depositary receipts, each representing
one ordinary share, fell $1.28 to $43.63 at 12:44 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 The cases include AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP v. Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., 10-cv-00346, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  
 To see the patents: 6,858,618 and 7,030,152.
