             The European Union and the
International Monetary Fund may have to lend Greece 150 billion
euros ($201 billion) over three years to keep the nation from
the bond markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  
 The EU and the IMF will need to inject more than three
times the existing $60 billion aid package to give Greece the
time to enact economic reform including reducing nominal wages
by as much as 20 percent, Erik Nielsen, chief European economist
with Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients today. Even a 75
billion-euro, 18-month lending program implies “important risks
and could lead to debt restructuring,” he wrote.  
 “The IMF-EU dealing with the present liquidity issue will
be more pronounced and longer than I had originally envisaged,”
the London-based Nielsen said. “I suspect that some haggling is
now going on between the IMF and the Euro-zone on the burden
sharing of a bigger program, but I rather doubt that the
Europeans can do more than the already announced 30 billion euro
for the first year.”
