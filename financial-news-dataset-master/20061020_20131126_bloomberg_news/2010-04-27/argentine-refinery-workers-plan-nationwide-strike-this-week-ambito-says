             Argentine oil workers plan to go on
strike at refineries in seven locations after two months of
salary talks failed, threatening to cause a fuel shortage,
Ambito Financiero reported.  
 Workers, seeking a 32 percent salary increase, plan a
complete halt at the units starting April 30 for an indefinite
period of time, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said, citing
Alberto Roberti, secretary general of the Federation of Oil, Gas
and Biofuel Workers.  
 The refineries are located in Lujan de Cuyo, La Plata,
Bahia Blanca, Salta, San Lorenzo, Dock Sud and Campana, Ambito
said, without naming any company.  
 Spain’s Repsol YPF SA, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Brazil’s
Petroleo Brasileiro SA are among oil producers that own
refineries at the locations.
