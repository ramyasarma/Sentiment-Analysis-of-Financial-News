             Sanlam Ltd., the largest South
Africa-based insurer, and Principle Capital Holdings SA entered
into a agreement in which Sanlam and some of the company’s
management will buy four million pounds ($6.16 million) of
shares in Principle.  
 The funds will be used to develop the business, the
companies said in a statement today. Sanlam and the other
investors will subscribe for a further four million pounds to
develop the business should certain fundraising and cost-saving
conditions be met.  
 Principle’s listing on the Alternative Investment Market
would be cancelled through the transaction. Principle, which was
founded in 2005 and invests in U.K. small-cap companies it
considers to be undervalued, will hold an extraordinary general
meeting for shareholders to vote on the agreement on May 19, it
said.
