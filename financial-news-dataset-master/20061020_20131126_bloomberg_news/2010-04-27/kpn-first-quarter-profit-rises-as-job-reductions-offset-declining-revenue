             Royal KPN NV, the largest Dutch
phone company, said first-quarter profit rose more than
analysts estimated as job cuts offset a drop in sales in the
Netherlands.  
 Net income advanced to 448 million euros ($599 million),
or 28 cents a share, from 317 million euros, or 19 cents, a
year earlier, The Hague-based company said in a statement
today. Analysts had predicted a 405 million-euro profit, the
average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 KPN, led by Chief Executive Officer Ad Scheepbouwer, cut
945 jobs in the first three months to protect profitability
after customers reduced spending and regulations forced tariff
cuts. The company has eliminated 8,512 jobs in the Netherlands
since 2005 and said it is on schedule to increase that total to
10,000 this year.  
 “The cost reductions are impressive,” said Rene Verhoef,
an Amsterdam-based analyst at Fortis Bank Nederland. “They are
ahead of expectations and of schedule. Verhoef has a “buy”
recommendation on the shares.  
 KPM climbed 1.2 percent to 11.16 euros at 12:18 p.m. in
Amsterdam trading.  
 KPN expects to raise prices by 1 percent to 1.5 percent in
2010 in the Netherlands, Chief Financial Officer Carla Smits-
Nusteling said on a call with reporters today, confirming an
announcement the company made in December.  
 Cost Cuts  
 First-quarter sales declined to 3.28 billion euros from
3.40 billion euros a year earlier. The average estimate of 19
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 3.32 billion euros.  
 Revenue in the Netherlands dropped 5 percent to 2.29
billion euros because of regulatory pressures and as clients of
computer-services unit Getronics continued to postpone
investments.  
 First-quarter earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization rose to 1.32 billion euros from
1.23 billion euros a year earlier.  
 KPN said it plans to keep cutting expenses even if the
Dutch telecommunications business returns to revenue growth, by
cutting spending on information technology, vacating buildings
and lowering personnel costs.  
 Operational expenses also declined on lower mobile
termination rates and roaming tariffs.  
 Dutch telecommunications regulator OPTA plans to further
reduce so-called termination rates for calls to mobile
customers by 83 percent to 1.2 euro cents a minute by Sept. 1,
2012, The Hague-based regulator said yesterday.  
 KPN is studying OPTA’s proposed rate cuts but doesn’t
expect them to affect its outlook, Scheepbouwer told reporters
on a call.  
 Revenue Forecast  
 The company repeated it expects revenue this year will be
“in line with” last year’s 13.5 billion euros, with Ebitda
forecast at more than 5.5 billion euros.  
 “KPN is suffering from margin pressures similar to those
exhibited across the whole of industry,” said Saeed Baradar, a
telecommunications sales specialist at Societe Generale SA in
London. “Although the company confirms its 2010 and 2011
outlook, I really do not believe that the visibility exists for
the end of this year, no matter 2011.”  
 KPN will also study TDC A/S’s Sunrise unit in Switzerland
again after Swiss regulators halted its merger with France
Telecom SA’s local Orange unit last week, Scheepbouwer said on
a conference call with analysts. He said he “doubts” that KPN
will pursue Sunrise. KPN was previously interested in buying
Sunrise in 2008.  
 Sales at the iBasis Inc. unit, a wholesaler of
international calling minutes, fell to 193 million euros from
199 million euros a year earlier.  
 Sales in Germany, where KPN is the third-largest wireless
operator, dropped 0.8 percent to 768 million euros. Service-
revenue decline slowed to 0.7 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter.
