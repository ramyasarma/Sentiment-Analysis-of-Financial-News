             OAO Protek, the drug wholesaler
raising $400 million in Russia’s biggest initial public offering
since 2007, received more than $1 billion of investor orders
after pricing the shares near the bottom of its target range,
three people familiar with the deal said.  
 The company set the price at $3.50 per share after initial
guidance of $3.10 to $4.50, Protek said in an e-mailed
statement. Protek is the largest IPO in Russia since property
developer LSR Group raised $772 million in 2007.  
 Protek advanced 7.7 percent to $3.77 in its first day of
trading today on the RTS.  
 “The current Russian IPOs show investors are demanding a
discount,” Chris Weafer, chief strategist at UralSib Financial
Corp., said in a phone interview. “There is interest in Russia,
but only if the price is right. Investors will no longer pay a
premium for Russia exposure.”  
 Companies are returning to Russia’s main stock exchange
after a rally in commodity prices helped lift the dollar-
denominated RTS 11 percent this year, beating so-called BRIC
markets in Brazil, India and China. Renaissance Capital and UBS
AG, which are joint global coordinators and bookrunners of the
Protek offering, predict $20 billion of Russian offerings this
year.  
 Even as stocks rally, companies priced share sales at the
lower end of their ranges after investors lost money in United
Co. Rusal’s sale in January, the first public offering of a
Russian company in Hong Kong. Rusal, the world’s largest
aluminum producer, ended today at HK$8.55, or 21 percent below
its IPO price of HK$10.80, and has never recouped declines since
it started trading three months ago.  
 ‘Demanding Discounts’  
 Russian Sea Group this month set its IPO price at the
bottom of its $6-$8 per share range, in an offering that raised
a total of $90 million rather than the $174 million it
originally sought, according to a company statement on April 16.
The stock dropped 1.7 percent today to $5.75 and is down 4.2
percent from its IPO price.  
 “The valuation and pricing is the key to any IPO and it’s
a delicate negotiation process between the banker and the
company,” said Tom Mundy, a strategist at Renaissance Capital,
which is advising on 16 listings, said by phone.  
 At least two other companies plan IPOs over the next month.
Kuzbass Fuel Co. is seeking to raise $295-$398 million, the
company said April 19. Agriculture holding OAO Rusagro aims to
raise as much as $250 million in May, according to two people
familiar with the deal.  
 UralChem Holding Plc, the maker of nitrogen-based
fertilizer, said April 19 it is looking for as much as $642
million from an IPO in London.
