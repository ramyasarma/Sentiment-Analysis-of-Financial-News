             Cotton futures declined for a
second straight day on concern that a rally to a two-year high
was overdone. Orange juice also fell.  
 Before retreating yesterday, cotton jumped as much as 1
percent to the highest price since March 2008, on speculation
that a recovery in the global economy will lift demand for
textiles. The 19-commodity Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index slid as
much as 2 percent.  
 “This is a follow-through of yesterday’s action,” said
Mike Stevens, an independent trader in Mandeville, Louisiana.
“Some investors are liquidating as the market looks overbought
at current level.”  
 Cotton for July delivery fell 0.69 cent, or 0.8 percent, to
85.2 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price
gained 5.7 percent last week, the most since mid-February, and
is up 61 percent from a year ago.  
 In another ICE market, orange-juice futures for July
delivery declined 0.55 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $1.364 a pound
in New York. The price has gained 5.7 percent this year.
