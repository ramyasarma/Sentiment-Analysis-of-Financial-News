             European Central Bank council
member Ewald Nowotny said raising borrowing costs too early
would hurt an economic recovery in the 16-nation euro region.  
 While the ECB has started a “cautious” exit from its
unconventional measures, a “premature” increase in the
benchmark interest rate would undermine a recovery, Nowotny said
today in a speech at Princeton University, according to an e-
mailed statement from Austria’s central bank, of which he is
also governor.  
 The euro-area economy doesn’t face any threats of inflation
or deflation at the moment, Nowotny said.
