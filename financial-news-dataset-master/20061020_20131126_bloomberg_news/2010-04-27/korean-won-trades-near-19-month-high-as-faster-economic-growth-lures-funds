             South Korea’s won traded near a 19-
month high as better-than-expected economic growth figures
fanned overseas demand for the nation’s equities.  
 Global funds added to their holdings of Korean shares for
the fifth day in a row after the central bank today said gross
domestic product increased 1.8 percent from the final quarter of
last year, when it rose 0.2 percent. Economists forecast 1.5
percent growth, a Bloomberg survey showed. The Kospi stock index
slipped from a 22-month high after concern about proposed U.S.
financial reforms contributed to a 0.4 percent retreat in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  
 “Strong gross domestic product data was good but the
market will be dominated by sentiment factors,” said Thomas
Harr, senior currency-strategist at Standard Chartered Bank.
“We could see it potentially break 1,100 this week.”  
 The won traded at 1,104.95 per dollar as of 10:09 a.m. in
Seoul, from 1,103.80 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has gained 5.3 percent this year and
yesterday touched 1,102.85, its strongest level since Sept. 12,
2008.  
 The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, fell two basis points to
2.91 percent. The change reflects reduced speculation on the
extent to which the Bank of Korea will raise its benchmark rate
from a record-low 2 percent in the coming 12 months.  
 South Korea’s consumer confidence was unchanged in April at
110, holding at its lowest level since July, according to an e-
mailed statement from the Bank of Korea today. A number
exceeding 100 indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.  
 South Korea’s benchmark three-year bonds rose for a fourth
day, pushing the yield on the 4.25 percent note due December
2012 down by three basis points to 3.73 percent.
