             Real estate investor Scott
Rechler’s RXR Realty LLC is in exclusive discussions to buy 340
Madison Ave., a 22-story midtown Manhattan office building, from
Broadway Partners, a person familiar with the deal said.  
 RXR may pay $570 million for the 22-story tower, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the deal isn’t
complete. At that price, the building would be worth about $770
a square foot, based on the square footage listed on Broadway
Partners’ Web site. RXR, based in Uniondale, New York, is in 
talks</a> to buy the property in phases, taking only a partial
interest at first, the person said.  
 A deal for 340 Madison would demonstrate a recovery in New
York’s office market, Woody Heller, executive managing director
at Studley Inc., said in an interview this month. Manhattan
commercial property sales tripled in value in the first quarter
to $3.3 billion, according to broker Cushman & Wakefield Inc.  
 The tower may be at least the third Manhattan office
building to sell this month. SL Green Realty Corp., New York’s
biggest office landlord, agreed to buy 600 Lexington Ave. for
$193 million, or $636 a square foot. Mexican billionaire Carlos
Slim will pay $140 million, or $343 a square foot, for 417 Fifth
Ave., a person familiar with the agreement said April 21.  
 The 340 Madison Ave. building is 90 percent leased, the
person familiar with that transaction said. The tower is 739,000
square feet, according to Broadway Partners’ Web site. It
occupies the entire block front between East 43rd and 44th
streets, a block west of Grand Central Terminal.  
 Reckson Sale  
 Rechler, the former chief executive officer of Reckson
Associates Realty Corp., engineered the 2007 sale of that real
estate investment trust to SL Green for $4.5 billion. SL Green
resold two-thirds of Reckson’s portfolio of mostly offices in
New York suburbs to a partnership that would eventually become
known as RXR.  
 Broadway Partners, led by Chief Executive Officer Scott
Lawlor, has been unloading properties after buying $15 billion
of buildings since 2000, much of it with low-cost financing that
dried up after the credit crisis began in 2007. The New York
firm lost Boston’s Hancock Tower to foreclosure last year, and
forfeited 10 buildings, including 1000 Wilshire Blvd. in Los
Angeles, to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in July.  
 Calls to Lawlor and Rechler weren’t returned yesterday.
Philip Russo, a spokesman for CB Richard Ellis Group Inc., which
is brokering the sale, declined to comment.
