             American International Group Inc.,
recipient of a $182.3 billion government bailout, is “showing
signs of recovery” at insurance businesses, according to
Congressional auditors.  
 “For the first time since the second quarter of 2008,
additions to AIG life and retirement policyholder contract
deposits have exceeded withdrawals,” the Government
Accountability Office said today in its third report examining
the New York-based company’s rescue. “AIG’s property-casualty
companies also have shown some improvements.”  
 AIG, bailed out in September 2008 to prevent a U.S.
economic collapse, has been under fire from lawmakers over the
cost of the rescue and bonus payments to employees of the
derivatives unit. Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche is
seeking to minimize defections of customers and employees needed
to help repay the aid.  
 “Several indicators on the status of AIG’s insurance
companies illustrate that AIG’s insurance operations are showing
signs of recovery, but federal assistance has been a critical
factor,” according to the GAO report.  
 Benmosche has agreed to testify before the Congressional
Oversight Panel next month about the New York-based insurer’s
plan to repay taxpayers, according to a person with knowledge of
the matter. Benmosche has said that $51 billion in life division
divestitures should largely repay a Federal Reserve credit line,
allowing AIG to turn to repaying its Treasury assistance.  
 Preferred Shares  
 Treasury is considering a plan to convert AIG preferred
shares into common stock and sell the holdings on the open
market over two years, a person with knowledge of talks with the
insurer said this month. If AIG consents to the strategy and
there is sufficient investor demand, the sales could be
announced as early as the fourth quarter, the person said.  
 AIG’s rescue package is valued at $182.3 billion, which
includes a $60 billion Federal Reserve credit line, as much as
$69.8 billion in Treasury assistance and $52.5 billion to buy
mortgage-linked assets that were owned or backed by the company.
The firm owes about $25 billion on its Fed line and more than
$47 billion to Treasury.  
 The GAO, in a March 2009 report, addressed criticism from
rivals that the company may have sold insurance at below-market
rates to win customers. State regulators, brokers and buyers of
business coverage “have seen no indications that AIG’s
commercial property-casualty insurers are selling coverage at
prices inadequate to cover the risk involved,” GAO said in that
report.  
 In a September report, the GAO said AIG’s prospects for
repaying its federal bailout are “unclear.”

                          March 17 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg's Dan Kraut talks with Erik Schatzker about American International Group Inc.'s decision to draw $2.2 billion from a Treasury Department facility.
     AIG used the cash to redeem securities held by insurance subsidiaries, improving liquidity and a measure of capital adequacy watched by rating firms and regulators, according to a company spokesman. The New York-based company owes more than $70 billion on Federal Reserve and Treasury facilities. (Source: Bloomberg)
