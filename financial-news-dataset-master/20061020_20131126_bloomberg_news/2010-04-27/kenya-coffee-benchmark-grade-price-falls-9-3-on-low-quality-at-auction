             Kenya’s benchmark coffee grade fell
9.3 percent at an auction today after supplies increased amid
declining quality of the beans, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange
said.  
 The top AA grade sold at an average of $334.27 for a 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bag, compared with $368.65 a week earlier,
the agency said today in an e-mailed report from the capital,
Nairobi. Supplies rose 49 percent to 420 bags, it said.  
 The average price for all the coffee sold fell 2.5 percent
to $185.54 a bag from $190.26 last week, the exchange said.  
 Quality has fallen as better beans “were sold much earlier
in the season,” Kizito Keya, a dealer at Mumba Coffee Ltd.,
said by phone from Nairobi. “We had more miscellaneous grades
which impacted negatively on overall prices, although in real
terms some grades fetched better prices.”  
 Total sales at the auction rose 69 percent to 9,910 bags
worth $2.23 million from last week as buyers replenished their
stocks, the exchange said.  
 Supplies at the 22nd auction of Kenya’s 2007-2008 season,
which began on Oct. 1 and ends on Sept. 30, rose 73 percent to
14,875 bags, the agency said.  
 Kenya harvests the bulk of its crop from October through
December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to June.
The following are details of today’s auction in U.S. dollars for
