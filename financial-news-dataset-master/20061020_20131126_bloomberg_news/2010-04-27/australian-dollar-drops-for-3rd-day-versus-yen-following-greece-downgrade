             The Australian dollar fell for a
third day versus the yen as stocks and commodities tumbled after
credit-rating downgrades for Greece and Portugal spurred
investors to shun higher-yielding assets.  
 New Zealand’s currency dropped yesterday by the most since
February against the greenback as Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s
credit rating to junk and reduced Portugal’s two steps, fueling
concerns the debt-laden nations are moving closer to default.
Declines in Australia’s dollar may be limited before a report
economists said may show gains in consumer prices accelerated in
the first quarter.  
 “Soaring risk aversion and tumbling equity markets saw
investors trim positions in ‘growth-sensitive’ currencies,”
Mike Jones, a currency strategist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in
Wellington, wrote in a note to clients. “Renewed fears about
the health of European sovereigns will keep risk appetite
subdued in the short-term.”  
 Australia’s currency fell 0.2 percent to 85.18 yen as of
8:09 a.m. in Sydney and yesterday dropped as low as 84.99, the
weakest since April 19. It was unchanged at 91.55 U.S. cents
after falling 1.2 percent yesterday.  
 New Zealand’s dollar weakened 0.2 percent to 66.20 yen. It
fetched 71.14 U.S. cents from 71.13 cents yesterday, when it
dropped 1.7 percent.  
 Benchmark interest rates are 4.25 percent in Australia and
2.5 percent in New Zealand, compared with 0.1 percent in Japan
and as low as zero in the U.S., attracting investors to the
South Pacific nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such
trades is that currency market moves will erase profits.
