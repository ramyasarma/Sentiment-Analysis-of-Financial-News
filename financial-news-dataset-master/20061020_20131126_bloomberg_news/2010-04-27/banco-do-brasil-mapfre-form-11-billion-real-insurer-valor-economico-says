             Banco do Brasil SA and Mapfre SA 
will create one of Latin America’s biggest insurance companies,
to be valued at about 11 billion reais ($6.3 billion), Valor 
Economico reported, without saying where it got the 
information.  
 The insurer will have two holding companies, including one 
for life, property and farm insurance and a second for auto, 
home and company insurance, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.
The deal may be announced on May 5, Valor said.  
 Mapfre will have about 50.01 percent of the voting shares 
of both holding companies while Banco do Brasil will have about
49.99 percent, Valor said.  
 The companies still need to determine the amount Banco do 
Brasil will pay Sul America SA for its 30 percent stake in 
Brasilveiculos Cia. de Seguros unit, which will be part of the 
new insurer, Valor said.
