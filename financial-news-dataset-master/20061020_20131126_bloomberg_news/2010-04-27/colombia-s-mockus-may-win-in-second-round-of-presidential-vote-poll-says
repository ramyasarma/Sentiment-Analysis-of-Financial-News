             Colombia’s Green Party presidential
candidate Antanas Mockus would win in the second round of voting
against former Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, according to
a poll broadcast today by RCN Television.  
 Mockus may get 50 percent of the second-round vote in June
versus 37 percent for Santos, the poll by Ipsos Napoleon Franco
showed. In the first round of elections in May, Mockus would be
the top vote getter with 38 percent of support, the poll said.  
 The leading candidates have vowed to maintain the economic
and security policies of President Alvaro Uribe, who is barred
from running for a third straight term. Mockus received 1
percent of the vote when he faced Uribe in the first round of
2006 elections.  
 The $242 billion economy, South America’s fourth largest,
grew at record levels during Uribe’s eight years in office and
attracted about $50 billion in investment as he battled drug-
funded guerrillas and slashed the murder and kidnapping rates.  
 The poll surveyed 1,200 people. The margin of error and the
dates the survey took place weren’t immediately available.  
 Mockus last week said he may win the election in the first
round.  
 The peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,947.80 today, before
the poll results were released. The currency has gained 4.9
percent this year, the fourth-best performance against the
dollar among 26 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
