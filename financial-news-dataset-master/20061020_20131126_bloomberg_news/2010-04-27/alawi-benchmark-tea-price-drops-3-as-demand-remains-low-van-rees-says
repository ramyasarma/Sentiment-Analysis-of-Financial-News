             The benchmark price of tea in
Malawi, Africa’s largest producer of the crop after Kenya,
dropped 3 percent as demand for the leaf remains low.  
 The top grade of tea, known as pekoe fannings, fetched
$2.24 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) at a sale in the commercial
capital, Blantyre, compared with $2.32 a week ago, Van Rees BV,
a tea-trading unit of Netherlands-based NIBC Principal
Investments, said in an e-mailed report today.  
 “Up to 64 percent of the leaf was taken out of auction
unsold because farmers were not happy with the price on offer,”
Emmanuel Phiri, a manager at Van Rees, said in a telephone
interview from Blantyre. “The quality of leaf this time of the
year is poor and buyers are not willing to spend more. Prices
might change for the better from early next month.”  
 Supplies improved 29 percent to 470,440 kilograms from a
week ago while revenue increased 35 percent to $748,829, said
Van Rees.  
 Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign exchange earner
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from Malawi,
followed by South Africa and Kenya.
