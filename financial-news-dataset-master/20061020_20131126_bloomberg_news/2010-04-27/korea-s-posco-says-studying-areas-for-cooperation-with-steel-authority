             Posco, Asia’s third-biggest
steelmaker, said it is in talks with Steel Authority of India
Ltd. over areas of “possible cooperation” after signing a
strategic alliance contract in 2007.  
 “We are studying areas for cooperation, but it’s premature
to say we are talking over a specific project,” Posco spokesman
Choi Doo Jin said by phone today in response to a Press Trust of
India report.  
 Steel Authority of India and Posco are in talks to set up a
10-billion rupee mill in the western state of Maharashtra, the
report said, citing a government official it did not identify.
