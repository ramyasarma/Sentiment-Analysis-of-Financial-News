             The Saudi Railway Organization
extended the bidding period for the second phase of a $7 billion
rail line linking Jeddah’s international airport with Mecca and
Medina, Islam’s two holiest cities.  
 The extension to July, which was requested by bidders,
won’t affect completion of the project by the end of 2012,
according to a statement posted yesterday on the organization’s
Web site.  
 Saudi Binladin Group, Siemens AG, Deutsche Bahn AG, Alstom
SA and China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corp. are among
bidders for the contract to supply trains and electrical systems
for the 450-kilometer (280-mile) line.  
 This is the second time the railway organization has
extended the deadline, having already moved it forward from
February to the end of April.  
 On Feb. 1, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund said it
will provide interest-free loans to speed up the work.  
 Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, plans to
spend $400 billion on roads, airports and energy projects in the
five years to the end of 2013, to stimulate the economy.
