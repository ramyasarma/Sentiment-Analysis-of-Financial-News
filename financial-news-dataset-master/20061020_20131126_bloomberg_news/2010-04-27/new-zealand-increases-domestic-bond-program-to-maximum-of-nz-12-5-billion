             New Zealand will increase its bond
program to a maximum NZ$12.5 billion to meet ongoing demand, the
nation’s Debt Management Office said in a statement.  
 Sales to date for the 2009/2010 program total NZ$10.47
billion of the NZ$10.5 billion announced in October, office
treasurer Philip Combes said today. The increase will allow
continued regular sales for the rest of the fiscal year, he
said. Details of next year’s program will be announced May 20,
he said.
