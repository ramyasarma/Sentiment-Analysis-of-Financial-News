             Software AG, Germany’s second-
largest software maker, fell the most in a year in Frankfurt
trading after it sold fewer software licenses in the first
quarter than analysts estimated.  
 The shares fell as much as 8.66 euros, or 9.1 percent, to
86.56 euros, the biggest intraday decline since April of last
year. They traded at 90.07 euros as of 12:26 p.m., giving the
company a market value of 2.55 billion euros ($3.4 billion).  
 Software AG’s license sales, a gauge for future maintenance
and consulting revenue, rose 24 percent to 61.2 million euros in
the first quarter, the Darmstadt-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  
 “License sales came in lower than expected,” said Thomas
Becker, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, who predicted
they would reach a total of 64 million euros.  
 Software AG posted first-quarter net income of 28 million
euros today, up from 25.6 million euros a year earlier. Revenue
increased 51 percent to 250.3 million euros as sales outside
Europe, especially in the U.S., picked up, Chief Executive
Officer Karl-Heinz Streibich said in an interview from
Frankfurt.  
 The company reiterated that sales will rise by as much as
30 percent and net income will gain 8 percent to 12 percent this
year. This will again be a “record year,” Streibich said
during a conference call, reiterating that the sales target of
1.1 billion euros will be met this year, instead of 2011.  
 By 2014, Software AG forecasts earnings before interest and
taxes of 412.3 million euros and an EBIT margin of 29.4 percent
on sales of 1.4 billion euros, Chief Financial Officer Arnd
Zinnhardt said on the conference call.
