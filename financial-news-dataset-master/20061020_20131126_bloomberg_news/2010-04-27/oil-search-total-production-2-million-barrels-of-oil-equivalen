             Oil Search Ltd., Papua New Guinea’s
largest oil and gas producer, said first-quarter revenue almost
doubled on higher prices.  
 Revenue climbed to $133.9 million in the three months ended
March 31 from $68.6 million a year earlier, the Port Moresby-
based company said today in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange. Production rose 5 percent to 2 million barrels of oil
equivalent from 1.9 million barrels.  
 Oil Search, a partner in a $15 billion liquefied natural
gas project operated by Exxon Mobil Corp. in Papua New Guinea,
seeks to increase reserves to support two more production units,
it said April 23. The companies initially plan to build two
units able to produce 6.6 million metric tons of LNG a year.  
 Oil Search rose 1 percent to A$5.82 in Sydney trading at
11:54 a.m. local time, while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 was
little changed.  
 The Papua New Guinea LNG venture may produce more than 9
trillion cubic feet of gas during its first 30 years of
operation, Oil Search said in today’s statement. Gas deliveries
are scheduled to start in 2014.  
 Oil Search sold crude oil for an average of $73.78 a barrel
in the first quarter, up from $45.83 a year earlier. The company
reported production gains during the three months from its
Kutubu oil project northwest of Port Moresby.
