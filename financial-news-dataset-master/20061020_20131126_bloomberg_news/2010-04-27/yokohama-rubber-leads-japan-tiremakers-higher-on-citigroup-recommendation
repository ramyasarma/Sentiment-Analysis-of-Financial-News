             Yokohama Rubber Co. led a gain by
Japanese tiremakers after the improved demand outlook prompted
Citigroup Inc. to recommend the stocks.  
 Shares of Yokohama Rubber, Japan’s third-biggest tiremaker
by market value, jumped 3.5 percent to 442 yen at the 11 a.m.
break in Tokyo. Market leader Bridgestone Corp. advanced 1.6
percent to 1,588 yen, while closest rival Sumitomo Rubber
Industries Ltd. gained 1.7 percent to 830 yen. A gauge of
tiremakers posted the steepest climb among the Topix’s 33
industry groups.  
 “We raise our 2010 global demand growth forecast to 8.2
percent from 5.5 percent,” Arifumi Yoshida and Noriyuki
Matsushima, analysts for Citi, wrote about demand for tires in a
report yesterday. “We expect investors to start pricing in
earnings recoveries next fiscal year once the seasonal increase
in natural rubber prices ends.”  
 The analysts raised their ratings on Bridgestone and
Sumitomo Rubber to “buy” from “hold” and Yokohama Rubber to
“buy” from “sell,” according to the report. Yoshida is the
No. 2 ranked analyst in Nikkei Inc.’s 2010 survey.  
 Thailand, the world’s largest exporter of rubber, has
winter from February to April, when trees shed their leaves and
latex output slows. The free-on-board price, which excludes
freight and insurance, of Thai RSS-3 grade rubber for May
delivery rose to a record 130.55 baht ($4.06) per kilogram
yesterday, according to the Rubber Institute of Thailand’s Web
site.
