             Corn fell to the lowest price in
almost three weeks on speculation that rapid planting and
favorable growing conditions will aid early development and
boost yields in the U.S., the world’s largest producer and
exporter.  
 About 50 percent of the crop was seeded as of April 25,
compared with 19 percent a week earlier and 20 percent last
year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday. The
pace is the fastest since the department began collecting
national data in 1975, said Julie Schmidt, a USDA statistician
in Washington.  
 “The rapid pace increases the odds for farmers to plant
more acres with corn,” said Jim Gerlach, the president of A/C
Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana. “The early planting will boost
the chances for above-average yields.”  
 Corn futures for July delivery fell 5.75 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $3.5375 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
third straight decline. Earlier, the price dropped to $3.515,
the lowest since April 7.  
 Corn has fallen 15 percent this year in part because the
USDA forecasts a 13 percent increase in combined production from
Brazil and Argentina, the two biggest exporters after the U.S.  
 U.S. farmers may increase planting by 2.7 percent this year
to 88.798 million acres (35.9 million hectares), enticed by the
prospect of improved returns and the availability of acreage
normally sown with winter wheat, the USDA said March 31. That
would be the second-largest seeded area for corn seeded since
1946, behind only the 2007 crop, government data show.  
 More Planting  
 The record pace by farmers may lead to an increase of more
than 1 million acres from the USDA’s March planting estimate,
Gerlach said.  
 Since 1990, there have been only five years when corn
planting was more than 58 percent complete by the second week in
May. During those years, the average increase in corn plantings
from the March estimate to the June estimate by USDA was 1.07
million acres, data from the USDA show.  
 “Corn-planting progress is incredible, and that means
farmers are going plant more corn” than the USDA estimated,
Gerlach said. “People will be surprised” by how many acres
will be planted on ground that was left idle by rains the past
two years and how much is shifted from other crops, Gerlach
said.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.
