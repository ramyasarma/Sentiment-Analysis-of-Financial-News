             Mexico’s peso fell to the lowest
level in a week after credit downgrades escalated Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis.  
 The currency dropped 1.3 percent to 12.3086 per U.S. dollar
at 12:27 p.m. New York time, from 12.1518 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 12.3524, the weakest level since April 19. The loss
pared the peso’s gain in 2010 to 6.4 percent, making it the best
performer against the dollar among the 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Standard & Poor’s cut Greece three levels to BB+, or junk,
and lowered Portugal two steps to A-.  
 “The bad news out of Portugal is provoking a stampede out
of risky assets from stock exchanges to currencies” said Ramon
Cordova, a currency strategist at Base Internacional Casa de
Bolsa SA in Monterrey, Mexico. “The market is beginning to
think about what happens if this goes beyond Greece and
Portugal, and into Spain, which is even bigger.”  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.69 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the securities
fell 0.52 centavo to 120.20 centavos per peso.  
 “We are seeing pressure again in Europe as the situation
in Greece remains unresolved,” said Rafael Camarena, an
economist with Banco Santander SA in Mexico City. “We are
starting to see that other countries in Europe, like Portugal,
are being affected.”  
 Germany won’t release funds to help Greece until the nation
has a “sustainable” plan to reduce its deficit, Chancellor
Angela Merkel said yesterday.
