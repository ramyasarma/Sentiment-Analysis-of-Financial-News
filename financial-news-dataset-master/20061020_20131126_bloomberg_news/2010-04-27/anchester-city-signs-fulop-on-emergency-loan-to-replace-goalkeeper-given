             Manchester City signed Sunderland
goalkeeper Marton Fulop on an emergency loan for its remaining
three games of the season as it seeks a Champions League spot.  
 City had been trying to recall Joe Hart, whom it loaned to
Birmingham, to replace the injured Shay Given for Premier League
games against Aston Villa, Tottenham and West Ham. Given’s
injury and an operation to backup Stuart Taylor had left City
with just one fit senior goalkeeper in Gunnar Nielsen.  
 “We anticipate that Marton Fulop will join us in training
tomorrow and we thank him and Sunderland for their help in this
situation,” City said in a statement on its website.  
 City is in sixth place in the standings with 63 points, one
behind Tottenham and Villa and one ahead of seventh-place
Liverpool. The team finishing fourth after 38 games enters the
qualifying rounds of next season’s Champions League.
