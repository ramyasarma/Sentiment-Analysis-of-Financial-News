             Goldman Sachs Group Inc. received a
100 percent payout on its collateral from American International
Group Inc. because “it was what they owed us,” Chief Financial
Officer David Viniar said.  
 Viniar, who spoke today at a Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations hearing in Washington, said there was no
negotiation with the U.S. Treasury Department over the payout.
Viniar said Goldman Sachs received about $12.9 billion in 2008
related to securities-lending and credit-default swap contracts
with AIG.  
 The New York-based insurer, as part of a bailout
orchestrated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, paid 100
cents on the dollar on credit-default swaps purchased by bank
counterparties including New York-based Goldman Sachs. The New
York Fed said it had to make the payments after banks refused to
accept so-called haircuts, according to a November audit from
Neil Barofsky, the special inspector of the U.S. Troubled Asset
Relief Program.  
 Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
testified at a hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission in January that he was never asked by U.S. regulators
to accept a discount on the AIG contracts.
