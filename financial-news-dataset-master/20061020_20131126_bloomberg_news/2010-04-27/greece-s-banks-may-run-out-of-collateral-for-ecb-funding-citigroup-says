             Greece’s banks may run out of the
collateral used to get funding from the European Central Bank as
Greek sovereign debt falls in value, according to Citigroup Inc.
Chief Economist Willem Buiter.  
 Greek banks probably get most of their short-term funding
from the ECB, using mainly Greek sovereign debt as collateral,
Buiter said in a note yesterday. When the value of the state
debt falls in the secondary market, the decline in the mark-to-
market value of the collateral may trigger margin calls -- or
demands for more collateral, Buiter said.  
 “Eventually the Greek banks could run out of additional
collateral acceptable to the ECB/Eurosystem,” Citigroup said.
“Their funding needs are likely to be exacerbated by a
withdrawal of deposits that could become a run.”  
 Greece’s economic crisis has raised funding costs for Greek
banks and forced them to borrow from the ECB rather than in the
market. The ECB said on March 25 that it would extend emergency
lending rules, adding that Greek bonds won’t be cut off from ECB
refinancing operations next year. The bank had been scheduled to
reintroduce pre-crisis rules at the end of 2010, which sparked
concerns over the Greek banks’ abilities to raise funding.  
 If Greece’s lenders run out of collateral and suffer an
outflow of deposits, the ECB would have “to reduce the minimum
quality threshold on securities acceptable as collateral,
currently BBB- or the equivalent, or refuse to lend to the Greek
banks,” Citigroup’s Buiter said. That would trigger “a funding
crisis and possible bank failures,” he said.  
 Banking Crisis  
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou triggered his
country’s 45 billion-euro ($60 billion) bailout from the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund on April 23
after failing to convince investors that the state could pare a
surging budget deficit, which stood at 13.6 percent last year.  
 Earnings at National Bank of Greece SA, the country’s
largest lender, and EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA, Alpha Bank SA and
Piraeus Bank SA may suffer this year as government measures
aimed at slashing the fiscal deficit curb loan demand and drive
up defaults. Both National Bank and Piraeus posted a net loss in
the fourth quarter after loan losses increased. Domestic bank
deposits fell 3.6 percent in the first two months of the year.  
 “Although a banking crisis would not trigger a sovereign
default in any mechanical way, it could increase the reluctance
of the markets to fund the sovereign and may precipitate a
‘sudden stop,’ which would leave the sovereign wholly dependent
on funding from the IMF and the other Euro area member
governments,” Citigroup said. “The ECB/Eurosystem could end up
with large mark-to-market losses on its loan portfolio.”  
 European banks are “seriously exposed to Greek risk” and
had total exposure of $193.1 billion at the end of December.
French lenders have the biggest claims on the Mediterranean
country, at $78.8 billion, followed by German banks with $45
billion and British lenders with $15.4 billion, Citigroup said,
citing data from the Bank for International Settlements.
