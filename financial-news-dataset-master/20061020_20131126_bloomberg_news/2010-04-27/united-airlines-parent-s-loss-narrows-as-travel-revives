             United Airlines parent UAL Corp.,
the company in merger talks with Continental Airlines Inc., said
its first-quarter loss narrowed to $82 million as travel demand
began to revive.  
 The net loss of 49 cents a share shrank from $382 million,
or $2.64, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15 percent to $4.24
billion, the Chicago-based carrier said today in a statement.  
 The results reflected UAL’s performance before discussions
began this month on a tie-up with Continental that would create
the world’s largest airline. United raised ticket prices,
collected more fees and benefited from previous cost reductions
such as parking jets and cutting jobs.  
 “We improved our cash position, maintained our cost
control, accelerated our revenue improvement and generated an
operating profit,” Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said
in the statement.  
 UAL said its loss excluding what the company considers one-
time items was $92 million, or 55 cents a share. On that basis,
analysts expected a 62-cent loss, the average of 8 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The average of 6 analysts’ sales
projections was $4.18 billion.  
 Passenger traffic was little changed in the quarter from a
year earlier, United said, suggesting that demand had begun to
strengthen after a 15 percent plunge in the same period in 2009.
