             Most Asian stocks fell as declines
among health-care and technology companies overshadowed gains by
material producers and consumer shares.  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific was little changed at 127.29 as of
9:27 a.m. in Tokyo. Three stocks declined for every two that
advanced. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.4 percent.
