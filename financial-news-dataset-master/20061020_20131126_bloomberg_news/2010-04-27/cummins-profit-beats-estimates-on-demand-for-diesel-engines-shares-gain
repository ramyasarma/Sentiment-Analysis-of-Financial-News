             Cummins Inc., the maker of diesel
truck engines and generators, reported first-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates and raised its 2010 sales forecast as
demand increased in Asia and Latin America. The shares climbed.  
 Net income rose to $149 million, or 75 cents a share, from
$7 million, or 4 cents, a year earlier, the Columbus, Indiana-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts projected per-
share earnings of 35 cents, the average estimate of 16 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “Strength in emerging markets more than offset the
weakness in North America,” Kristine Kubacki, a St. Louis-based
analyst at Avondale Partners LLC, said in a report today.  
 The company raised its forecast for 2010 sales to $12
billion from $11 billion projected in February.  
 “Our strength in large developing markets such as China,
India and Brazil has given us a significant boost as those
economies have continued to recover from the recession more
quickly than other regions,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Solso
said in the statement.  
 Cummins rose $4.35, or 6.2 percent, to $74.66 at 9:51 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares earlier
increased 8.6 percent, the biggest intraday gain since Feb. 2.
Cummins climbed 53 percent this year through yesterday.
