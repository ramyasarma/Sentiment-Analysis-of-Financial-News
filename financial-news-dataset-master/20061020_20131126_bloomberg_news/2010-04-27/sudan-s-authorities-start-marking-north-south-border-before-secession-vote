             Sudanese authorities began marking
the border between the north and south today in preparation for
the referendum Southern Sudan is scheduled to hold in January to
decide whether to become an independent nation.  
 The boundary technical committee has started “demarcating
the border line on the ground,” Abdallah al-Sadig, the body’s
chairman, told reporters today in the capital, Khartoum.  
 The referendum is part of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace
Agreement peace agreement that ended a 21-year war between
Sudan’s mostly Muslim north and the south, where Christianity
and traditional religions dominate. As many as 2 million people
died in the conflict.  
 The government of President Umar al-Bashir, who retained
his post in this month’s first multiparty vote in 24 years, and
the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, which governs Southern
Sudan, must agree on the border close to oil-rich areas.
Officials from both sides serve on the boundary committee.  
 Sudan is sub-Saharan Africa’s third-largest producer of
crude oil, pumping about 480,000 barrels a day, according to the
BP Statistical Review of World Energy. Most of the fields are in
the south.  
 Bashir’s government and the Southern Sudan administration,
led by its president, Salva Kiir, must also negotiate issues
such as responsibilities for paying Sudan’s foreign debt and how
to share oil revenue if Southern Sudan secedes.  
 Under the peace agreement, the two sides share equally the
proceeds from oil produced in Southern Sudan.
