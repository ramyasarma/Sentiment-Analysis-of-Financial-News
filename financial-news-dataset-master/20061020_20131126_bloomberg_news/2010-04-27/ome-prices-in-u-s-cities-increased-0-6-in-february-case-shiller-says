             Home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose
less than forecast in February from a year earlier, a sign a
housing recovery will take time to develop.  
 The S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index of property values
in 20 cities increased 0.6 percent from February 2009, the
first gain since December 2006, the group said today in New
York. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News projected a 1.3 percent advance.  
 Home prices in February were 30 percent below the peak
reached in July 2006, indicating the industry that helped
trigger the worst recession since the 1930s will take years to
recover lost ground. A pickup in employment is needed to help
stem the damage from mounting foreclosures that are restraining
further gains in property values.  
 “The big plunge is over, but significant strength is
unlikely,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global
Ltd. in New York. “There is still a huge excess of vacant
houses.”  
 Confidence among U.S. consumers increased in April to the
highest level since September 2008 as Americans became more
upbeat about jobs, another report today showed. The Conference
Board’s index rose more than forecast, to 57.9 from 52.3 in
March, according to the New York-based private research group.  
 Stocks trimmed losses following the consumer confidence
report. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent to
1,208.35 at 10:12 a.m. in New York after dropping as much as
0.6 percent on growing concern over Greece’s debt crisis.  
 Consumer Confidence  
 The home-price index was forecast to rise after a year-
over-year drop of 0.7 percent for January, according to the
median forecast of 23 economists surveyed. Estimates ranged
from a decline of 0.8 percent to a gain of 1.6 percent. Year-
over-year records began in 2001.  
 The gauge fell 0.1 percent from the prior month after
adjusting for seasonal variations following a January increase
of 0.3 percent. Unadjusted, prices dropped 0.9 percent in
February from the prior month.  
 “These data point to a risk that home prices could
decline further before experiencing any sustained gains,”
David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P, said in
a statement. “It is too early to say that the housing market
is recovering.”  
 Conflicting Signals  
 The seasonally adjusted and unadjusted series “have given
conflicting signals” recently, with the former rising while
the latter fell, the group that issues the report said in an
April 20 statement. The turmoil in housing in the past few
years has influenced the models used in adjusting the data,
“resulting in larger seasonal adjustments and misleading
results,” according to the group.  
 The year-over-year gauges therefore provide better
indications of trends in prices, the group said. The panel
includes Karl Case and Robert Shiller, the economists who
created the index.  
 Eleven of the 20 cities in the S&P/Case-Shiller index
showed a year-over-year decline, led by a 15 percent drop in
Las Vegas and a 6 percent decrease in Tampa. San Francisco
showed the biggest year-over-year increase, with prices rising
12 percent.  
 Compared with the prior month, 19 of the 20 areas covered
showed a decrease on an unadjusted basis, led by Portland,
Oregon, and Minneapolis. San Diego showed the only monthly
increase.  
 Tax Credit  
 Prices may improve in coming months as homebuyers rush to
take advantage of a government tax credit worth as much as
$8,000 before it expires. Purchase contracts must be signed by
the end of this week and transactions need to close by the end
of June for buyers to be eligible.  
 Growing demand may help offset the pressure on prices from
mounting foreclosures. Filings jumped 16 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, and bank seizures reached a
record, according to Irvine, California-based RealtyTrac Inc.
Foreclosures push up the number of homes on the market, forcing
builders and sellers to make concessions to get deals done.  
 Some businesses see better prospects. M.D.C. Holdings
Inc., the Denver-based builder of Richmond America Homes, said
its loss narrowed in the first quarter from a year earlier as
orders jumped 38 percent.  
 “While this trend is encouraging, we remain cautious due
to the impending expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit
and depressed overall economic conditions,” Chief Executive
Officer Larry Mizel said in an April 23 statement.  
 Shiller, chief economist at MacroMarkets LLC and a
professor at Yale University, and Case, a former economics
professor at Wellesley College, created the home-price index
based on research from the 1980s.
