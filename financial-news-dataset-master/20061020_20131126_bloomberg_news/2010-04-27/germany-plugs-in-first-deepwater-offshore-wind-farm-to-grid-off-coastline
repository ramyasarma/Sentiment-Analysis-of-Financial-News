             Germany, the country that pioneered
the use of windmills for commercial power production, connected
its first deepwater offshore wind farm today as developers begin
plans to install thousands of turbines in the North Sea.  
 E.ON AG, Vattenfall Europe AG and the German utility EWE AG
invested 250 million euros ($333 million) to erect 12 turbines
45 kilometers (28 miles) off the German coast, the companies
said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 “We can now tackle additional offshore deepwater projects
in the German North and Baltic seas,” E.ON Chief Executive
Officer Wulf Bernotat said in the statement.  
 Germany aims to install 25,000 megawatts of offshore wind
capacity by 2030, Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen said
today at the opening of the wind farm, according to the
statement. That’s about the same amount of electricity the
country already generates from onshore windmills, or the
equivalent of about 7.5 percent of Germany’s power production.  
 The German Alpha Ventus wind farm is powered by Repower
Systems AG and Areva SA 5-megawatt turbines with the towers
planted on the seabed 30 meters (98 feet) below the water.
The project will be expanded in coming years, Germany said.  
 Germany has the most installed wind capacity in Europe.  
 Investments in offshore wind may grow as much as 71 percent
this year to about 1,000 megawatts, according to the European
Wind Energy Association. The U.K. leads the world in installed
offshore wind capacity.
