             Candover Investments Plc, a British
private equity investor since 1984, said it’s in talks to be
acquired, four months after it shut its 3 billion-euro ($4
billion) leveraged buyout fund.  
 The firm is in negotiations with Alberta Investment
Management Corp., said two people with knowledge of the talks,
who declined to be identified because the discussions are
private. Any offer is likely to be for no more than the firm’s
net asset value of 1,038 pence a share at the end of December,
the London-based firm said in a statement. Candover dropped 4.5
percent to 739 pence in London trading today.  
 “These discussions may or may not lead to an offer,”
Candover said in the statement, which didn’t identify the
bidder. “There can be no certainty as to the outcome.”  
 Candover Partners Ltd. shut its fund in January after
Candover Investments, its publicly traded unit, canceled a 1
billion-euro pledge to invest in the pool amid a cash shortage.
The firm slashed 58 percent of its workforce last year.  
 Officials at Alberta Investment Management couldn’t
immediately comment. The Financial Times reported Alberta’s
involvement earlier today.  
 AIMCo, as the fund is known, was established in January
2008 to manage investments for Alberta’s provincial government,
public pension plans and endowments, including the C$14 billion
($13.8 billion) Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund. Chief
Executive Officer Leo de Bever said in June that the fund
planned to spend about C$1 billion over the following 12 months
on private-equity investments.
