             The U.S. House’s tax-writing
committee will start drafting legislation in June to extend some
of the income tax cuts enacted during former President George W.
Bush’s term, House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer said.  
 Under a provision included in the 2001 legislation, the tax
cuts are to expire at this year’s end.  
 President Barack Obama has said the tax cuts he wants
extended include those that benefit American families earning
under $250,000 annually. He also proposed allowing the
expiration of tax cuts for families with incomes exceeding that
figure.  
 Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, gave no timetable today for
when the full House would vote on the measure. “I don’t want to
make a judgment on that,” Hoyer told reporters. He said he
first wants to consult with the Ways and Means Committee’s
chairman, Michigan Democrat Sander Levin, about the panel’s work
schedule.  
 The committee will also deal with reviving the estate tax,
which expired at the end of last year.
