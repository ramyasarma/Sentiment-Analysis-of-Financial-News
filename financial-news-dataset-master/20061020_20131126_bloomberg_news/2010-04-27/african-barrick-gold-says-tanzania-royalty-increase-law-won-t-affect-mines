             African Barrick Gold Plc, the
mining company that sold shares for the first time in London
last month, said a new mining law in Tanzania won’t affect its
mines in the country.  
 The London-based company said it “doesn’t believe” the
law, which was passed by parliament on April 23, will affect its
operations because of agreements with the government that ensure
“fiscal stability.”  
 The mining law will raise gold royalty payments to 4
percent from 3 percent, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister
William Ngeleja said in a speech broadcast by the Tanzania
Broadcasting Corp. on April 24.  
 First-quarter net income rose to $53.1 million from $11.6
million a year earlier, African Barrack also said today in a
statement. Sales climbed 76 percent to $210.7 million.  
 African Barrick produced 177,095 so-called attributable
gold ounces in the quarter. It’s targeting full-year production
of 800,000 to 850,000 ounces. The company’s mines produced
716,000 ounces of gold last year.  
 African Barrick was spun off last month by Barrick Gold
Corp., the world’s largest gold producer, raising 581 million
pounds ($897 million) in the biggest London initial public
offering since 2008.
