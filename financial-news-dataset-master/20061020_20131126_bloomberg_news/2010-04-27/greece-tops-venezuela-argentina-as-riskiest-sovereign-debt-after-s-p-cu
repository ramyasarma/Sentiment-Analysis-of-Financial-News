             Credit-default swaps on Greek
government debt imply the highest probability of default of any
country tracked by CMA DataVision, surpassing Venezuela and
Argentina for the first time.  
 Swaps on Greece surged 115 basis points to 825 after
Standard & Poor’s cut the nation’s credit rating to junk,
implying a 48.1 percent likelihood of default over five years,
according to data compiled by CMA. That compares with 44.4
percent for Venezuela and 43.2 percent for Argentina.  
 The probability of default is calculated from credit-
default swap spreads and expected recovery rates. The recovery
assumption for Greece and other developed markets is 40 percent,
compared with 25 percent for emerging markets, according to CMA.  
 That means that while contracts on Venezuela and Argentina
are more expensive, their probability of default is lower.
Default swaps on Venezuela cost 839 basis points, while swaps on
Argentina cost 836, CMA data show.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
