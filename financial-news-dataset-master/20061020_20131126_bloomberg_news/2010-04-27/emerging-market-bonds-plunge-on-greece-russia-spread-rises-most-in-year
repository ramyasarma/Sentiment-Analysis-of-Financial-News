             The extra yield investors demand to
hold Russian bonds jumped the most since March 2009 as a cut in
Greece’s credit ratings to junk triggered a selloff across
developing-nation assets.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own Russian debt over
U.S. Treasuries rose 30 basis points to 1.87 percentage points
as of 4:40 p.m. in London, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
EMBI+ Index. The average spread for emerging-market bonds
climbed 18 basis points to 261 basis points, the largest
increase since February.  
 “We could see another wave of forced deleveraging, which
could obviously affect any high-yielding assets, including
emerging-markets debt,” said Luis Costa, an emerging markets
strategist at Citigroup Inc.  
 Greece had its rating cut to below investment grade by
Standard and Poor’s as it forecast investors would be paid no
more than half their initial outlay in the event of any
restructuring of debt. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou
was last week forced to activate a 45 billion-euro ($60 billion)
package of emergency loans from the euro region and the
International Monetary Fund, after the country’s soaring
borrowing costs made it harder to finance debt in the markets.
