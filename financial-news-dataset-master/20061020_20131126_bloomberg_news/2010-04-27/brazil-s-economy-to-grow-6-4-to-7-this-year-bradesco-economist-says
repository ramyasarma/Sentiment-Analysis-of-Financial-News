             Brazil’s economy will grow 6.4
percent to 7 percent this year as the country’s output gets
“close to overheating,” said Octavio de Barros, chief
economist at Banco Bradesco SA.  
 Brazilian policy makers will raise their target rate 75
basis points, or 0.75 percentage point, in their next meeting to
curb inflation, said Barros in a speech at an investment summit
organized by Terrapinn Holdings Ltd. in Sao Paulo.  
 “Inflation is a point of worry,” said Barros. “The fact
that so many banks are rising their growth expectations shows
how the economy is overheating.”
