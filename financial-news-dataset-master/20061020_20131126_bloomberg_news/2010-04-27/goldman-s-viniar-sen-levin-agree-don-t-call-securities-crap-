             Senator Carl Levin and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. Chief Financial Officer David Viniar agreed on
at least one thing during his testimony today before the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations: Investment bankers
shouldn’t call the securities they sell “crap.”  
 Levin asked what Viniar felt when he read e-mails in which
Goldman Sachs employees described mortgage-linked securities as
“crap” or “shitty.”  
 “I think that’s very unfortunate to have on e-mail,”
Viniar said, drawing laughter from the audience and the press.  
 “Please don’t take that the wrong way,” Viniar said when
pressed by Levin. “I think that’s very unfortunate for anyone
to have said that in any form.”  
 Levin then asked, “How about to believe that and sell
it?” and Viniar agreed that was also unfortunate.  
 “Well, that’s what you should have started with,” Levin
said.  
 Viniar apologized to Levin a second time after the senator
returned to the hearing room following a vote. “You were 100
percent right,” Viniar said.
