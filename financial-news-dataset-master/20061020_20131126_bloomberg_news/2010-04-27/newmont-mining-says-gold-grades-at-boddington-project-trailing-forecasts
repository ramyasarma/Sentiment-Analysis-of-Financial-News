             Newmont Mining Corp., the largest
U.S. gold producer, said gold grades at its new Boddington mine
in Australia are trailing the company’s expectations while
copper grades are exceeding estimates.  
 “We’re slightly down on the gold grade and up on the
copper grade” at Boddington, which began commercial production
in November, Brian Hill, executive vice president of operations,
said on a conference call with analysts. “We need to get a
couple more quarters under our belt of mining to be able to come
back with some more definitive answers.”  
 Newmont bought the one-third stake in Boddington it didn’t
already own from AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. in June to help increase
output of the precious metal and benefit from record prices. The
project helped the company more than double first-quarter profit
and boost sales in the period by 46 percent to $2.24 billion.  
 Newmont will use its cash to develop existing projects,
Chief Executive Officer Richard O’Brien said on today’s call.  
 “We are finding some interesting opportunities internally,”
O’Brien said. “That’s where we’d rather invest our cash versus
in external projects or an increase in the dividend.”  
 Newmont fell 63 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $52.56 at 12:42
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares gained 12
percent this year through yesterday.  
 Gold futures on New York’s Comex exchange averaged about
$1,110.69 in the first quarter, up 22 percent from the year-
earlier period.
