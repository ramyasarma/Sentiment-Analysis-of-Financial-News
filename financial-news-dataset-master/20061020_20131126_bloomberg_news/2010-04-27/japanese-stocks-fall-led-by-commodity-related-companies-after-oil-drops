             Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
rose for a second day, led by companies reporting earnings that
exceeded their forecasts.  
 Fanuc Ltd., the maker of factory controls and robots,
surged 11 percent. IHI Corp., a manufacturer of heavy machinery,
advanced 9.3 percent. Konica Minolta Holdings Ltd., a film maker,
climbed 7.5 percent. The three companies climbed the most in the
Nikkei 225 after reporting results. Hitachi Construction
Machinery Ltd. led declines after missing its projection.  
 “The earnings recovery is shoring up the market,” said
Yoshihiro Ito, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Okasan Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $8.1 billion. “Investors
are rushing for equities to profit from good corporate
earnings.”  
 The Nikkei 225 rose 0.4 percent to close at 11,212.66 in
Tokyo, reversing a drop of as much as 0.5 percent. The broader
Topix index climbed 0.1 percent to 997.63, with about three
shares declining for every two that advanced.  
 The Topix has gained 9.9 percent this year, the most among
benchmark indexes of the world’s 15 largest equity markets.
Speculation that cost cuts and a U.S. economic recovery will
boost earnings has outweighed concern that China will cool
growth and that Greece will struggle to avoid a debt default.
