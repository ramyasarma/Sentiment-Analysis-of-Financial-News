             Potash application by farmers may
stay below average this year as agricultural profitability
remains “subdued” this year and next, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said in a report.  
 “With limited discretionary free cash flows and facing
inflationary pressures from fuel, labor and land rents, we do
not expect farmers will accept the $30 a ton price increase
proposed by producers globally in the first half of 2010,” the
bank said in the report.
