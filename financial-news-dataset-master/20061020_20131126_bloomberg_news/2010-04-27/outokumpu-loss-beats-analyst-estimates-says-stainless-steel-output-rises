             Outokumpu Oyj, a Finnish stainless-
steel maker, posted a narrower first-quarter loss and said
output is “gradually” rebounding on improved demand.  
 The net loss narrowed to 21 million euros ($28 million)
from 187 million euros a year earlier, the Espoo-based company
said in a statement today. The figure beat the average 26.2
million-euro loss of 12 analyst estimates Bloomberg compiled.
Outokumpu said it’s “gradually increasing” output and second-
quarter underlying earnings will be “somewhat positive.”  
 “The second-quarter guidance in terms of earnings should
be a slight disappointment to the market,” Artem Beletski, an
ICECAPITAL Markets analyst with a “hold” recommendation, said
by phone. “People were expecting it to be more positive.”  
 Outokumpu fell as much as 4.4 percent, the steepest drop
since Feb. 3, and traded down 1.2 percent at 17.05 euros by
11:20 a.m. in Helsinki trading. The eight-member Bloomberg
Europe Steel Index declined 1.3 percent.  
 “Even though there was no improvement in profits in the
first quarter, demand and delivery volumes were up,” Chief
Executive Officer Juha Rantanen said in the statement. “The
profit improvement will follow in the second quarter.”  
 The stainless steel market began to recover at the start of
2010, with the company’s sales up 35 percent to 916 million
euros during the first quarter, Outokumpu said.
