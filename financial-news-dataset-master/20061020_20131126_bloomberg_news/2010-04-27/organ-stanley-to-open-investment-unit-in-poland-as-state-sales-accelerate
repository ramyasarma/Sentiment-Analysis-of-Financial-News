             Morgan Stanley plans to open an
investment unit in Poland, following some of the world’s biggest
banks seeking to land fees from planned government asset sales.  
 The New York-based company will join Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG in vying for advisory work in a
market “that’s becoming a leading financial hub in central and
eastern Europe,” Franck Petitgas, the head of investment
banking at Morgan Stanley, said in a statement today.  
 The Polish government this year plans to sell stakes in its
energy, insurance, chemical and phone companies to raise $10
billion to finance the widening budget deficit. Potential
advisory work on those sales is helping draw in foreign banks,
while the economy is the only one in the European Union that has
avoided a recession.  
 Marcin Socha, Morgan Stanley’s executive director in
Poland, will head the Warsaw office. The bank also plans to
become a member of the Warsaw Stock Exchange to give its
customers direct access to stocks traded in the Polish capital,
it said.  
 Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is also seeking to open a
branch office in Warsaw, spokeswoman Monika Schaller said on
March 25. Credit Suisse announced in January a plan to open a
brokerage this year after shuttering its Warsaw stock-dealing
business in 2003.
