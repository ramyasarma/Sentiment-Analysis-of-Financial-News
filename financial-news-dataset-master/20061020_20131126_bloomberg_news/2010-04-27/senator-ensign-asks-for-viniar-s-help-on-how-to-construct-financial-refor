             Senator John Ensign, a Nevada
Republican, asked for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Financial
Officer David Viniar’s advice on financial regulation at a
congressional hearing today.  
 While Ensign said Congress may not take Viniar’s advice, he
said Congress doesn’t have enough expertise to draft reform
legislation itself. In his reply, Viniar suggested tougher
regulations on how much liquid assets banks have to hold.  
 Ensign was questioning Viniar today at congressional
hearings in Washington.
