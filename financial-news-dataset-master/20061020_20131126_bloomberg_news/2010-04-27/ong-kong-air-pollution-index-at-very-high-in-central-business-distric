             Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index
reached a “very high” reading of 118 today at the roadside
station in the city’s Central business district, the
Environmental Protection Department said on its Web site.
Readings above 100 trigger warnings for people with heart and
respiratory conditions to avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic
areas.
