             U.S. stocks trimmed losses after a
gauge of consumer confidence topped economists’ estimates in
April.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,209.24 at 10:02 a.m. in New York after dropping as much as 0.6
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.31
points, less than 0.1 percent, at 11,200.72  
 The Conference Board’s confidence index rose more than
forecast, to 57.9 from 52.3 in March, according to the New York-
based private research group. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a rise to 53.5. A measure
of expectations was the highest since 2007.
