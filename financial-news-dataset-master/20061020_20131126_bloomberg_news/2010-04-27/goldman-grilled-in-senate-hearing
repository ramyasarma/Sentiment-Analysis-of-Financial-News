             Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told a Senate panel that
market-makers have no obligation to tell clients about their own
position in a security.  
 Blankfein, responding to questions from Senator Carl Levin,
chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said
the nature of the principal business often puts the firm on the
opposite side of customers.  
 “What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,” Blankfein said. “The thing we are selling to
them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not
coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably, the
institutional clients we have, wouldn’t care what our views are.
They shouldn’t care.”  
 The Senate panel, winding up a probe of Goldman Sachs that
has lasted more than a year, used today’s hearing to pepper
current and former executives with questions about their duty to
clients and the ethics of betting against the housing market as
the bank also sold mortgage-linked securities to customers.  
 Seven current and former Goldman Sachs employees testified
about the mortgage-securities business in the years leading to
the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression.  
 Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, was sued for fraud earlier this month by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company contests the
claim.  
 Blankfein said people on Wall Street weren’t certain that
housing prices would drop before the financial crisis began.  
 “I think we’re not that smart,” Blankfein said. “Even the
people who in hindsight knew it, I think they thought it, and
then it turned out they were right. I can tell you for my own
self, at 20 percent down in the housing market, I didn’t know
whether it would go down 30 percent or rebound up 10 percent.”
