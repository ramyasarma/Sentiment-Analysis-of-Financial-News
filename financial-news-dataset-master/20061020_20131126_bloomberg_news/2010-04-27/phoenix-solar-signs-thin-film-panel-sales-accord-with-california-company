             Phoenix Solar AG signed an
agreement with MiaSole Inc. of Santa Clara, California, to take
delivery of thin-film panels that generate electricity from the
sun, helping to expand the German company’s sales product range.  
 Phoenix Solar, based in Sulzemoos near Munich, has ordered
4.5 megawatts worth of MiaSole panels for the second quarter, it
said today in a statement. The panels offered for resale include
a recycling warranty and convert the sun’s rays to electricity
with an efficiency ratio of 10.5 percent, the company said.  
 Phoenix Solar shares have declined about 8 percent over the
past year.
