             U.K. and Irish stocks tumbled the
most in at least five months after Standard & Poor’s downgraded
Greece and Portugal, spurring concern that indebted European
nations are moving closer to default.  
 Barclays Plc and Bank of Ireland Plc dropped more than 3
percent. Kazakhmys Plc and Rio Tinto Group sank more than 5
percent as copper tumbled in London. Tullow Oil Plc fell 4.6
percent as crude retreated below $83 a barrel.  
 The benchmark FTSE 100 Index sank 150.33, or 2.6 percent,
to 5,603.52, the biggest drop since Nov. 26. The FTSE All-Share
Index fell 2.5 percent and Ireland’s ISEQ Index sank 4.5
percent, the most since October.  
 “Markets are now becoming increasingly nervous that the
problems Greece are experiencing could spread to other euro zone
states, pushing the price of government debt higher,” said Nick
Serff, London-based market analyst at City Index.  
 Stocks extended losses after S&P lowered its ratings on
Greek debt three steps to junk, while Portugal’s was cut two
levels as contagion from Greece’s debt crisis spreads through
the euro region. Ignis Asset Management said Portugal will
follow Greece in having its debt downgraded to junk.  
 Barclays, Britain’s second-largest bank, dropped 3.7
percent to 357.2 pence. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
retreated 3.5 percent to 56 pence. Bank of Ireland, the
country’s biggest lender, sank 10 percent to 1.72 euros.  
 Mining Companies Fall  
 Kazakhmys, Kazakhstan’s biggest copper mining company,
dropped 6.2 percent to 1,389 pence as base metals retreated on
the London Metal Exchange. Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest
mining company, fell 5.2 percent to 3,607 pence. Antofagasta Plc
retreated 3.7 percent to 1,025 pence.  
 Tullow Oil lost 4.6 percent to 1,168 pence as crude dropped
as much as 2.7 percent. Cairn Energy Plc retreated 4.3 percent
to 395.3 pence. Petrofac Ltd., an oil services provider which
today agreed to acquire Deepstore Ltd., slid 4.3 percent to
1,148 pence.  
 The following stocks also rose or fell in the U.K. and or
Irish markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  
 Connaught Plc (CNT LN) rallied 25 pence, or 9 percent, to
302. The biggest U.K. public-housing maintenance company said
first-half revenue rose 17 percent to 355 million pounds ($544
million). Numis Securities upgraded the shares to “buy” from
“add.”  
 Fyffes Plc (FFY ID) lost 3 cents, or 8.1 percent, to 34
cents after the Irish banana distributor said selling prices
have been “significantly” lower than expected amid
“difficult” trading conditions.  
 Premier Foods Plc (PFD LN) dropped 3.55 pence, or 12
percent, to 26.6 after the company said its non-branded sales
continued to decline as people took up cut-price offers by
competitors. Non-branded sales fell by 12.9 percent in value and
8.7 percent in volume in the three months ended March 31.
