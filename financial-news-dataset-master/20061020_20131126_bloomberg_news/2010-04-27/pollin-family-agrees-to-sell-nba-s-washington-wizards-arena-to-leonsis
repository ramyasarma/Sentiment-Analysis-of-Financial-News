             The family of late Washington
Wizards owner Abe Pollin reached an agreement to sell its stake
in the team and its arena to a group led by minority owner Ted
Leonsis.  
 Pollin’s widow, Irene, and their sons, Robert and James,
reached an accord on the “major economic terms” to sell the
National Basketball Association franchise, the Verizon Center
and some related sports businesses to Leonsis and his partners
at Lincoln Holdings LLC, the Pollin family said in a statement
released by the Wizards.  
 Leonsis said in an e-mail that he wouldn’t have any comment
about the matter until the agreement is final.  
 Financial terms weren’t disclosed. The Wizards are worth
$313 million, according to Forbes magazine, ranking 19th among
the NBA’s 30 franchise.  
 Leonsis, 53, a former AOL vice chairman, said in November
that he intended to exercise his exclusive right to purchase the
remainder of the Wizards following Pollin’s death on Nov. 24.  
 Leonsis is majority owner and chairman of closely held
Lincoln Holdings, which bought 44 percent of Pollin’s Washington
Sports & Entertainment LP in 1999. That company’s assets include
the Wizards, the Verizon Center and the Ticketmaster franchise
in Baltimore and Washington.  
 “We join our mother Irene, the sole principal owner of the
franchise today, in congratulating Ted Leonsis and his Lincoln
Holdings partners on reaching this near-final step in a long
negotiation,” the family said in the statement.  
 Bullets Days  
 Abe and Irene Pollin bought the franchise, then known as
the Baltimore Bullets, in 1964, making their tenure as owners
the longest in NBA history. The team moved to Washington in 1974
and won an NBA championship in 1978.  
 “First and foremost, this is a moment at which we wish to
honor Abe Pollin, our late father, and all that he accomplished
along with our mother Irene Pollin in the world of professional
sports,” the family said in the statement.  
 Leonsis stepped down from day-to-day activity at Time
Warner Inc.’s AOL in 2006 after 15 years with the company. He
now holds the title of vice chairman emeritus.  
 Lincoln Holdings, an investment partnership among Leonsis
and 10 other area business leaders, purchased the National
Hockey League’s Washington Capitals from Pollin in 1999 and the
Washington Mystics of the Women’s NBA six years later.
