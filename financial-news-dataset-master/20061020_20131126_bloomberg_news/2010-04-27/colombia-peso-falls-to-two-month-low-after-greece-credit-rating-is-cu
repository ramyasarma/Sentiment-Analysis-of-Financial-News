             Colombia’s peso fell to the lowest
level in more than two months on concern Greece’s debt crisis
may spread to Europe’s other indebted nations.  
 Colombia’s peso dropped 0.8 percent to 1,964 per U.S.
dollar at 2:46 p.m. New York time, from 1,947.80 yesterday.
That’s its weakest since Feb. 9. The peso has plunged 2.2
percent this month.  
 “Markets are very volatile given concern that this will
spread to other European countries and the extent of the
spread,” said Camila Estrada, head analyst at Banco de Credito
SA. “Declines in Latin American currencies are in line with the
nervousness.”  
 Irish, Portuguese and Spanish notes declined after
Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel said Greece must provide a
program for cutting its budget deficit before getting a European
Union-led bailout package. Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit
rating three levels to BB+, or junk, and reduced Portugal’s
rating two steps, citing “fiscal and economic structural
weaknesses.” S&P lowered Portugal’s long-term local and foreign
currency ratings to A-, or four grades above junk, from A+, with
a negative outlook.  
 Speculation Colombian exporters may sell dollars, taking
advantage of the weaker local currency, may ease declines in the
peso, according to Estrada.  
 The peso may rise to as high as 1,915 by year-end as the
recovering global economy leads to higher prices of oil,
Colombia’s biggest export, and amid increased foreign direct
investment flows into the South American country, Estrada said.  
 ‘Breather’  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 8.39
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price fell 0.832 centavo to 117.432 centavos per peso.  
 Yields have dropped 39 basis points since an April 5
government report showed annual inflation slowed to 1.84 percent
in March, its lowest level since 1955, and below the 2.19
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “Bonds are taking a breather after the inflation
surprise,” Estrada said. Yields will fall to as low as 8.15
percent, she estimates. Higher inflation readings and concern
over Colombia’s widening budget deficit won’t allow yields to
drop below 8 percent, she said.  
 Colombia forecasts the central government’s budget deficit
will widen to 4.5 percent of gross domestic product this year,
its highest level since 2005, and up from 4.2 percent in 2009,
as a sluggish economy crimps tax revenue.
