             The shekel declined against the
dollar for the first time in three days after Bank of Israel
Governor Stanley Fischer left the benchmark lending rate
unchanged.  
 The central bank yesterday held the rate at 1.5 percent,
after last month increasing it for a fourth time since August,
on concern a strengthening shekel may undermine exports and
dampen economic growth. Seven of 15 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had predicted the decision, while eight expected a
quarter-point increase.  
 “Fischer is trapped -- he doesn’t want to let the shekel
strengthen on the one hand, but he also doesn’t want to let
inflation spin out of control so he’s raising rates ever so
slowly” said Shlomo Maoz, chief economist at Excellence Nessuah
Investment House Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  
 The shekel slid as much as 0.4 percent to 3.7390 per dollar
and was trading at 3.7300 as of 4:13 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  
 Fischer has been buying foreign currency since March 2008
in bid to limit a rally that has seen the shekel strengthen 14
percent against the dollar in the past year.  
 The decision to hold rates is part of a gradual process of
returning interest to a more “normal” level, position
inflation firmly within the 1 percent to 3 percent target and
spur economic recovery, the bank said yesterday. Inflation
slowed to 3.2 percent, from 3.6 percent the month before.  
 Bonds rose with the Tel-Bond 60 index of the 60 largest
corporate bonds by market value adding 0.1 percent to 252.33 at
the close.  
 The government’s benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due
February 2019 gained 0.21 shekel to 109.45, pushing the yield
three basis points lower to 4.8 percent.
