             Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co.,
Japan’s fifth-largest bank, reported its first increase in
annual profit in three years on a decline in bad-loan costs as
the economy recovered from its deepest postwar recession.  
 Net income jumped six-fold to 53 billion yen ($565 million)
in the 12 months ended March 31, from 7.95 billion yen a year
earlier, the Osaka-based lender said in a preliminary earnings
statement today. Total credit costs dropped to 4 billion yen,
compared with 170 billion yen a year earlier.  
 The Japanese government said this month the economy is
“picking up steadily,” and the central bank’s Tankan gauge of
corporate confidence showed that large manufacturers are the
least pessimistic since 2008. A 34.4 billion yen charge to
revalue goodwill at Sumitomo Trust’s First Credit Corp. trimmed
what would have been an even larger gain in earnings.  
 The company cited “greater-than-expected continuous
stagnation of real estate conditions” for the charge at First
Credit.  
 Sumitomo Trust, which plans to merge with smaller Chuo
Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc., recorded net income of 52.2 billion
yen in the first nine months of the financial year.
