             Banco do Brasil SA and Banco
Bradesco SA signed a memorandum of understanding to integrate
part of their credit- and debit-card operations.  
 The two Brazilian banks may jointly create credit and debit
cards as well as a company to sell cards to groups of clients,
Banco do Brasil said in a regulatory filing today.  
 The lenders are also considering transferring their stakes
in Cielo SA to a new company that they may create, according to
the statement.
