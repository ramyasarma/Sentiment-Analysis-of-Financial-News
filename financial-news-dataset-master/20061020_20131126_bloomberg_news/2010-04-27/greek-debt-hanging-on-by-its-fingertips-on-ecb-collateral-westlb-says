             Greek debt is on the threshold of
losing the credentials needed for use as collateral in European
Central Bank operations after a downgrade by Standard & Poor’s, 
according to WestLB AG.  
 “Greece is hanging on by its fingertips with only the
Moody’s rating keeping it eligible as ECB collateral without a
haircut,” said John Davies, a fixed-income strategist at WestLB
in London. “With further downgrades from Moody’s and Fitch it
could become ineligible and Greek banks, in particular, would be
in a very bad state for sure.”   
 “One big question is how much the ECB is prepared to
stretch its credibility on the collateral issue. If it’s
adjusting its collateral thresholds purely to protect Greece,
isn’t that some kind of a bailout?” he said.  
 With the downgrade, “everything has taken yet another step
for the worse,” Davies said in a phone interview. “The
situation is much more critical now. It really has gone up a
number of notches in the last 48 hours.”
