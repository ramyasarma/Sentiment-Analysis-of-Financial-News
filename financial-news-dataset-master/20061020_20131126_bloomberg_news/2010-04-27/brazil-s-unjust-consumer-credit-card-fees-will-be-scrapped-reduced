             Brazil’s government will limit the
fees credit card companies can charge consumers, Justice
Minister Luiz Paulo Barreto said.  
 The National Monetary Council, led by Finance Minister
Guido Mantega, will be allowed to set rules on credit card fees
under a proposal Barreto revealed to reporters today in
Brasilia. Lawmakers will also be asked to give the council
broader authority to regulate credit cards, he said.  
 The changes to Brazil’s credit card rules are a response to
consumer complaints, Barreto said. He said the council will
scrap “unjust” fees and will try to reach agreements with
credit card companies to avoid more stringent regulations in the
future.  
 Market failures allowed Redecard SA, the Brazilian
processor of Mastercard Inc., and Companhia Brasileira de Meios
de Pagamento, known as Cielo, to post profits higher than what
can be considered “fair,” the central bank said in a March 31,
2009, report. The government is trying to set new rules to boost
competition amid credit card companies and protect consumers.
