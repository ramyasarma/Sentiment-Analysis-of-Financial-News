             Delek Group Ltd., a partner in
Israel’s largest natural-gas discovery, raised 255 million
shekels ($68 million) from the sale of bonds exchangeable into
shares. The stock fell for the first time in three days.  
 The 4.1 percent bonds due in 2012 are convertible into
Delek stock at 1,225 shekels a share, the company said today in
an e-mailed statement. The shares fell 1.4 percent to 823.80
shekels at 12:27 p.m. in Tel Aviv, trimming this year’s gain to
6.5 percent.  
 Proceeds from the sale will be used to refinance debt,
Chief Executive Officer Asaf Bartfeld said in the statement.
Investors bid for about 800 million shekels of the bonds,
according to the statement.
