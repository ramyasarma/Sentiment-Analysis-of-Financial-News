             BP Plc said it’s targeting more
than 1 billion barrels of recoverable resources with its
acquisition of Value Creation Inc.’s Terre de Grace oil-sands
block in Canada.  
 BP and Value Creation formed a partnership in March to
explore and develop the area in the Athabasca region of Alberta,
the London-based company said today in a statement. BP agreed to
pay $900 million for a 75 percent interest in the project.  
 “Terre de Grace is a high-quality resource,” Fergus
MacLeod, BP’s head of investor relations, told investors today
on a conference call. “It’s a material asset.”  
 BP will be the operator of Terre de Grace, a 185,000-acre
stretch of land about 300 miles (500 kilometers) north of
Calgary, according to Value Creation. The partners expect the
field to start producing oil in 2011 and say it may yield more
than 300,000 barrels a day.
