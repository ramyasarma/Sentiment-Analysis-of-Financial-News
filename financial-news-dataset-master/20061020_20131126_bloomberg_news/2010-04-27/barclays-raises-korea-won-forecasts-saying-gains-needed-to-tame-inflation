             Barclays Plc raised its forecasts
for South Korea’s won, saying faster appreciation will allow
policy makers to moderate the pace of interest-rate increases
needed to keep inflation in check.  
 The one-, three-, six- and 12-month estimates were
strengthened to 1,090, 1,075, 1,050 and 1,025 per dollar,
respectively, Singapore-based regional economist Wai Ho Leong
wrote in a research note published today. Barclays previously
predicted the currency would trade at 1,100 for the next one to
six months, before appreciating to 1,050 in a year’s time.  
 “Bank of Korea could start normalizing the policy rate as
early as June,” Leong wrote. “Given that the tightening will
be in ‘baby steps,’ rate hikes could be augmented by more rapid
appreciation of the won to ward off imported inflation
pressures.”  
 He predicts the central bank, which has kept its benchmark
seven-day repurchase rate at a record-low 2 percent for 14
consecutive months, will increase borrowing costs by 0.75
percentage point this year. Consumer prices rose in March by the
least in five months, climbing 2.3 percent from a year earlier
after gaining 2.7 percent in February, official figures show.  
 Barclays increased its 2010 inflation forecast for South
Korea to 2.4 percent, from 1.9 percent, and its economic growth
estimate to 5.7 percent from 5 percent, according to today’s
note. The Bank of Korea today announced gross domestic product
rose 1.8 percent in the first quarter from the previous three
months, when it expanded 0.2 percent. That beat the median 1.5
percent gain forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The won traded at 1,105.60 per dollar as of 11:10 a.m. in
Seoul, from 1,103.80 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has gained 5.3 percent this year and
yesterday touched 1,102.85, its strongest level since Sept. 12,
2008.
