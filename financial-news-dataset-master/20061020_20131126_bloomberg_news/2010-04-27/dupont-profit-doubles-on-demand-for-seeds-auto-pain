             DuPont Co., the third-biggest U.S.
chemical maker, more than doubled first-quarter profit and
raised its 2010 earnings forecast as farmers bought more
genetically modified seeds and demand for electronics recovered.  
 Net income increased to $1.13 billion, or $1.24 a share,
from $488 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier, Wilmington,
Delaware-based DuPont said today in statement. That topped the
$1.06 average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Chief Executive Officer Ellen Kullman, who shut plants and
cut jobs last year as the recession eroded demand, is hiring
back some contractors to keep pace with revenue that jumped 23
percent in the first quarter. Seed sales helped the agriculture
segment lead company earnings, while units that make electronics
materials and auto plastics returned to profit.  
 “Volumes are strong,” Laurence Alexander, a New York-
based analyst at Jefferies & Co., said today by telephone.
“There is evidence of there being a broader turn.”  
 Earnings excluding some items this year will be $2.50 to
$2.70 a share, DuPont said, raising its January forecast of
$2.15 to $2.45 because of “stronger sales” and wider profit
margins. Earnings in 2010 were expected to be $2.39 a share, the
average estimate of 15 analysts.  
 DuPont rose 26 cents to $41.21 at 9:45 a.m. New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 22 percent this
year through yesterday.  
 First-Quarter Sales  
 First-quarter revenue rose to $8.48 billion as sales
volumes surged 19 percent, the biggest gain in more than a
decade, DuPont said in a presentation on its Web site. Prices
excluding currency fluctuations rose 2 percent.  
 “Macro trends drove first-quarter demand,” Kullman said
in the statement.  
 Sales rose 16 percent in the U.S. and 15 percent in
Europe. The fastest gain was a 71 percent increase in the Asia-
Pacific region, where volumes surged 65 percent, DuPont said.  
 Investors will be encouraged by the revised earnings
outlook because it reflects improved prospects for the entire
business, not just for agriculture, which has been strong for
years, Alexander said.  
 Kullman told investors in November that she plans to
increase annual earnings 20 percent through 2012. The company
expects sales gains of 10 percent will more than make up for the
loss of $1 billion in royalties from hypertension medicines
Cozaar and Hyzaar, which lost patent protection in Europe last
month and go off patent in the U.S. this month.  
 Drug Profit  
 The drugs, marketed through Merck & Co., contributed $221
million to first-quarter profit, $60 million more than expected,
and will add $360 million to $400 million to full-year earnings,
DuPont said.  
 Agriculture segment operating profit rose 10 percent in the
first quarter to $941 million as Pioneer seed sales increased 15
percent in North America, DuPont said in the presentation. Some
European seed sales shifted to the current quarter because
weather conditions delayed planting, said Karen Fletcher, a
company spokeswoman.  
 The coatings and performance materials units benefited from
resurgent U.S. demand for cars and light trucks that boosted
industry sales 16 percent through the first three months of the
year.  
 Performance Materials  
 The performance-materials unit, which makes plastics for
car parts and gets about 40 percent of sales from the auto
market, earned $230 million compared with a $146 million loss a
year earlier.  
 The coatings business, the world’s biggest maker of
automotive paint, posted a $45 million profit, compared with a
$75 million loss a year earlier, because of increased demand
from carmakers, DuPont said.  
 The electronics and communications segment earned $105
million on sales to makers of semiconductors and solar panels
compared with a year-ago loss of $34 million. Photovoltaic
materials comprise a quarter of the segment’s revenue, Fletcher
said.  
 DuPont has begun rehiring some of the 10,000 contractors
laid off during the recession to keep pace with increased
demand, Fletcher said.  
 Dow Chemical Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp. are the two largest
U.S. chemical makers by sales.
