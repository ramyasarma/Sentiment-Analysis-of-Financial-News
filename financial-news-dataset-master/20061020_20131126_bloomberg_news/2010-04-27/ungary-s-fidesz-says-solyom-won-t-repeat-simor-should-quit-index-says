             Hungarian President Laszlo Solyom
probably won’t return after his term ends in August and central
bank President Andras Simor should resign, said Zoltan Pokorni,
a senior member of the Fidesz party, according to Index.  
 Pokorni, whose Fidesz party won parliamentary elections
that ended on April 25 by a landslide, spoke on TV2 today,
according to the news Web site. Premier-in-waiting Viktor Orban
yesterday said that the central bank “shouldn’t be the residence
of offshore knights,” Index said.
