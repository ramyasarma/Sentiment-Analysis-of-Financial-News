             Nigeria will introduce price caps
for operators in the telecommunications industry, the Nigerian
Communications Commission said.  
 The commission “will not engage in direct price control,”
acting Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bello, who took over from
Ernest Ndukwe early this month, said in the capital, Abuja,
according to an e-mailed statement yesterday.  
 Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, has 78.5 million
operating telephone lines compared with 425,000 in 2000, Ndukwe
said in early April. The growth in lines makes the price cap
possible, Bello said yesterday.  
 The commission will start registering mobile-phone SIM
cardholders from May 1 with a three-month transition period,
which will enable operators to resolve problems with the
process, Bello said.
