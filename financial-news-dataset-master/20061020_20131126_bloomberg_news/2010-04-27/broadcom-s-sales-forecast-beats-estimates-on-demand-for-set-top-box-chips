             Broadcom Corp., the biggest maker
of chips for television set-top boxes, forecast second-quarter
sales that topped analysts’ estimates.  
 Revenue will rise as much as 12 percent to $1.64 billion
from the first quarter’s $1.46 billion, Irvine, California-based
Broadcom said today in a statement. That compares with the $1.42
billion average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Semiconductor makers including Texas Instruments Inc. and
Intel Corp. have forecast second-quarter revenue that beat
predictions after demand for computers, industrial machinery and
communications topped predictions last quarter.  
 Net income was $210.2 million, or 40 cents a share, in the
first quarter, Broadcom said. That compares with a loss of $91.9
million, or 19 cents, a year earlier. The average analyst
estimate was 28 cents a share. First-quarter revenue rose 71
percent from a year earlier.  
 Product gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining
after deducting the cost of production, will be unchanged from
the 50.5 percent that the company reported in the first quarter,
Broadcom predicted.  
 Broadcom rose 38 cents to $35.20 in late trading after the
company released its results. Earlier the shares fell $1.21 to
$34.82 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has climbed 11
percent this year through the Nasdaq close.
