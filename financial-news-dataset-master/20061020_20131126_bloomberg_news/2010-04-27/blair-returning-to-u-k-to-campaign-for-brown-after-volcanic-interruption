             Tony Blair, trapped overseas by a
lack of flights after Iceland’s volcanic eruption, will return
to the U.K. to campaign for his successor as prime minister and
Labour Party leader, Gordon Brown, in the May 6 election.  
 “He was grounded overseas by the ash crisis but I gather
he is now winging his way back to Blighty,” Business Secretary
Peter Mandelson told reporters in London today, using a slang
word for Britain. Asked if Blair would play a role in Labour’s
campaign, Mandelson replied, “You won’t be disappointed.”  
 Blair has made one appearance so far in Labour’s campaign,
giving a speech in northeast England on March 30. Labour is
trailing in third place behind the Conservatives and Liberal
Democrats in opinion polls, which suggest it may be heading for
its worst performance in an election since 1918.  
 The former premier, who won office in 1997 after 18 years
of Conservative rule, previously appeared publicly in the U.K.
in January to give evidence to an inquiry into the U.S.-led
invasion of Iraq in 2003 and Britain’s role in the subsequent
conflict. Blair’s testimony sparked a public protest over his
support for the war.
