             French consumer confidence
unexpectedly slipped in April as households held off from making
major purchases on concern about their future ability to save.  
 A gauge of household sentiment dropped to minus 37 from
minus 34 in March, Paris-based national statistics office Insee
said today in an e-mailed statement. Economists had expected a
reading of minus 33, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 After benefiting from government incentives to buy new cars
last year, households concerned about job losses now face
reduced purchasing power as President Nicolas Sarkozy cuts back
on stimulus. Consumers were more concerned about their future
savings and less likely to make a major purchase this month than
in March, Insee said today.  
 Sarkozy’s effort to overhaul the pension system may also be
weighing on confidence, according to Pierre-Olivier Beffy, chief
economist at Exane BNP Paribas in Paris. “Saving for a rainy
day is encouraged on the eve of a pension reform with little
visibility,” he said.  
 The government, which is in talks with labor unions and
employers’ federations on pensions, plans to submit a draft law
proposing changes to the system by early July.  
 Insee publishes its latest jobless estimates later today.
