             New York Governor David Paterson
said he would ask state lawmakers for a “simple up-or-down”
vote on his proposed executive budget for the year that began
April 1.  
 If they don’t pass the plan, Paterson said he would ask the
Legislature to convene five days a week, instead of three, until
they reach an agreement.  
 “If the Legislature does not stay in Albany to pass a
budget, I will be forced to consider all of my options at that
time, including compelling them to stay,” Paterson said in a
statement today.  
 Paterson said he plans to ask for a one-day-a-week furlough
of about 100,000 state workers to lower labor costs by $30
million a week.  
 New York, the third most-populous U.S. state, may sell
cash-management notes or delay paying bills to cope with a cash
shortage in the first week of June, Robert Megna, the state’s
budget director, said today. Earlier this month, he said the
state faced a $1 billion shortage in its cash balance.
