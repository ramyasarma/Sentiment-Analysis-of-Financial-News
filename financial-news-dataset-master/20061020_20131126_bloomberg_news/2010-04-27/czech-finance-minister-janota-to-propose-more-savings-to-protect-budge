             Czech Finance Minister Eduard
Janota said he will propose more measures to save money in the
budget to ensure the budget deficit does not exceed the
government’s target of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product for
this year.  
 Janota made the comments today at a press conference in
Prague following the weekly Cabinet meeting.
