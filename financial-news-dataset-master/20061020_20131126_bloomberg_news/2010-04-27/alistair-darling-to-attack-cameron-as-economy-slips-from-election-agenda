             Chancellor of the Exchequer
Alistair Darling will say today that David Cameron lacks the
right instincts to manage Britain’s economy, telling voters the
Conservative Party leader made the wrong calls during the
financial crisis.  
 Darling’s speech in Edinburgh will mark an attempt by the
ruling Labour Party to move the economy back to the center of
the May 6 election campaign, which has been dominated by
discussion of how the U.K. will be governed if no party gains a
majority in Parliament, as polls suggest.  
 “It’s not their youth and inexperience that worries me
about the Tory leadership,” Darling will say, according to
excerpts from the speech released by Labour. “It is their
values, their instincts and their dangerous policies. It gives
me no pleasure to say it, but I was right -- and they were
wrong.”  
 Darling will say that Cameron largely opposed his decisions
to stimulate demand, protect workers and underpin the banking
system as the financial crisis triggered the worst recession in
six decades. The comments will come a day before the last of
three televised debates, in which Cameron will spar with Prime
Minister Gordon Brown and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg
over the economy.  
 Darling will appeal to voters to judge Labour on its record
and give it another chance to govern for a fourth successive
term. He will say Cameron’s plans to cut Britain’s record budget
deficit more aggressively than Labour will endanger the
recovery. The economy expanded by 0.2 percent in the first
quarter, according to figures published last week.  
 ‘Misguided, Unfair’  
 “It’s why I feel so strongly of the risks ahead, the
damage that can be done by following Tory policies which are
misguided, unfair and put ideology above our country’s needs,”
Darling will say.  
 Philip Hammond, a Conservative who speaks on Treasury
matters, said yesterday that Labour’s plans would saddle
households with an extra 220 pounds ($336) a year in taxes than
if it wins the election.  
 The deficit, at more than 11 percent of gross domestic
product, is the largest in the Group of Seven. The
Conservatives, who have pledged to go further and faster than
Labour and the Liberal Democrats to cut the shortfall, last week
said the International Monetary Fund might need to bail out the
U.K. if the vote produces an indecisive result.
