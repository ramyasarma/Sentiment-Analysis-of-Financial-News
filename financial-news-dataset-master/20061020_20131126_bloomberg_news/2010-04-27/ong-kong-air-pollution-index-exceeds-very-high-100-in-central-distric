             Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at levels topping 100 at two roadside stations
today, the Environmental Protection Department said on its Web
site. The readings in the Central and Causeway Bay districts
trigger a government warning to people with heart or respiratory
illnesses to avoid staying in heavy traffic areas.
