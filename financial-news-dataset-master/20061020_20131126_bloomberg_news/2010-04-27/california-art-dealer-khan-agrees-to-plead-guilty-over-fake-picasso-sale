             A California art dealer agreed to
plead guilty in a case in which she was accused of selling a
fake Pablo Picasso drawing for $2 million and telling the buyer
that the work came from the Malcolm Forbes family estate.  
 Tatiana Khan of West Hollywood agreed to admit to lying to
Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and witness tampering,
the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles said today in a
statement. Under the plea agreement she faces as long as 21
months in prison, according to the statement.  
 Khan, 70, was accused in January of paying an artist $1,000
to make a copy of a 1902 Picasso work, the Woman in the Blue
Hat, claiming she needed the copy because the original work had
been stolen from one of her clients. She then sold the drawing
for $2 million and told the buyer she was working as a broker
for the Forbes family, prosecutors said.  
 “Tatiana Khan is a reputable art dealer who is trying to
accept responsibility,” Jim Spertus, her lawyer, said in a
phone interview.  
 The case is U.S. v. Khan, 10-00152, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Los Angeles).
