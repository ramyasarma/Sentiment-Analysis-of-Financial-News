             Spotify, Europe’s largest legal
online music site, added social features to the site, including
a direct integration with Facebook.  
 Spotify Social introduces a variety of features allowing
users to share and find music without leaving the site, most
notably using Facebook, the Stockholm-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. A library feature also allows users to
import stored music files on a computer into Spotify.  
 The site, which has 7 million users in Europe, is partially
owned by the biggest record labels such as Vivendi SA’s
Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group Corp. The company
has been in talks with unidentified U.S. Internet and mobile-
phone service providers about partnerships, as it aims to start
U.S. operations in the third quarter this year, Senior Vice
President Paul Brown said in an interview last month.  
 An estimated 325,000 Spotify users pay a monthly 9.99
pounds ($15.38) for the service ad-free. The site has had more
than 10 million euros in advertising revenue since starting in
October 2008 and users are buying “tens of thousands” of
tracks each week through a third party, Brown said.
