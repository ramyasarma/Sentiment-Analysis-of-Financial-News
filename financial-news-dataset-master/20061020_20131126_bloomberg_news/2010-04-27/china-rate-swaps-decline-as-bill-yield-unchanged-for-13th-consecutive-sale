             China’s interest-rate swaps fell as
the central bank kept one-year bill yields unchanged for a 13th
sale, adding to speculation it won’t raise borrowing costs to
cool the economy.  
 Policy makers have sought to curb property investment by
requiring developers to submit fund-raising plans for review.
The central bank lowered its benchmark one-year lending and
deposit rates by 27 basis points to 5.31 percent and 2.25
percent, respectively, in December 2008 and has kept them there
since. Yuan forwards traded near a three-month high.  
 “The central bank should be able to mop up liquidity
without pushing up yields, suggesting there is no imminent need
for a policy rate hike,” said Frances Cheung, a Hong Kong-based
senior rates strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “Authorities
appear to be focusing on specific sectors to address the
problems of liquidity and asset-price inflation.”  
 The one-year onshore swap rate declined two basis points to
2.11 percent as of 5:08 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 The People’s Bank of China sold one-year bills at a yield
of 1.9264 percent, according to traders at Bank of China Ltd.
and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. The monetary
authority offered 75 billion yuan ($11 billion) of the
securities.  
 The China Securities Regulatory Commission has sent
financing requests from 41 companies to the Ministry of Land and
Resources for reviews of land-use compliance, according to a
statement posted on a government Web site on April 24.  
 Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were at 6.6131 per
dollar, little changed from 6.6096 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts touched 6.593 on April 22,
the strongest level since Jan. 11. The yuan was little changed
at 6.8262 in the spot market.
