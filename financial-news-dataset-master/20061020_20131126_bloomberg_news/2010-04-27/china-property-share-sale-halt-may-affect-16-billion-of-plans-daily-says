             A halt on share sales by Chinese
property developers may affect 45 companies with plans to raise
as much as 110 billion yuan ($16 billion), the China Daily
reported today, citing an unidentified source close to the China
Securities Regulatory Commission.  
 The suspension of share sales would give the the Ministry
of Land and Resources the chance to investigate if companies
have illegally manipulated market prices, the Beijing-based
newspaper reported.  
 China’s tightening of real-estate regulations won’t hurt
the economy as urbanization in the nation will continue to fuel
growth, the newspaper cited Chinese central bank advisor Li
Daokui as saying.
