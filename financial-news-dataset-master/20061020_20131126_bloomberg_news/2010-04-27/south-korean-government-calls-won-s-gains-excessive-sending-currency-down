             South Korea’s Finance Ministry
said the won’s recent surge against the dollar was excessive
and vowed to take action to stem volatility, driving the
currency to a one-week low.  
 “The foreign-exchange authorities believe market players
bet excessively on the won’s rise,” Kim Ik Joo, director-
general at the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, told reporters
by phone today from Gwacheon. “The government will take
appropriate measures to stabilize the market if herd behavior
moves the exchange rate sharply.”  
 The remarks reflect the government’s increasing concern
that the currency’s 21 percent gain over the past year may
erode profits at the exporters that are leading the economy’s
recovery. The won earlier traded close to a 19-month high as
better-than-estimated economic growth figures fanned overseas
demand for the nation’s equities.  
 The Korean currency slid 0.6 percent to 1,110.15 per
dollar as of 3:13 p.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 1,114.45, the weakest since April 20.  
 Policy makers can try to influence exchange rates by
buying or selling currencies.  
 Global funds added to their holdings of Korean shares for
the sixth straight day after the central bank today said gross
domestic product increased 1.8 percent from the final quarter
of last year, when it rose 0.2 percent. Economists forecast 1.5
percent growth, a Bloomberg survey showed.  
 The Kospi stock index climbed as much as 0.2 percent to a
22-month high before slipping 0.2 percent at the close.
