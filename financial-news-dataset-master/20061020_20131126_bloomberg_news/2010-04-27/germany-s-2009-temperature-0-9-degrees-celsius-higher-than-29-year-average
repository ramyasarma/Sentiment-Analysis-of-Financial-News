             Germany’s temperature last year was
0.9 degrees Celsius (1.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 29-year
average, the national weather service said.  
 The average temperature in 2009 was 9.2 degrees Celsius and
a warming trend has occurred in northern and eastern Europe, the
state agency said today in a briefing in Berlin.  
 Warmer days and nights mean less demand for coal and
natural gas for heating from utilities like RWE AG and E.ON AG
and spurs the country’s cheese producers to prepare to change
their techniques.
