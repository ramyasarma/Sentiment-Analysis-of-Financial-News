             Former Panamanian President Manuel
Noriega flew to France from the U.S. under police escort on an
extradition warrant to face money-laundering charges.  
 Noriega, 76, who was overthrown by the U.S. and taken to
Florida in 1990, arrived in Paris today on an Air France flight
from Miami. He will appear in court for a preliminary hearing on
May 12, Yves Leberquier, his French lawyer, told i-Tele.  
 Noriega served a jail sentence on drug charges in the U.S.
from his overthrow until 2007. He remained in prison pending a
ruling on extradition requests by France and Panama.  
 Yesterday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signed a
warrant authorizing Noriega’s transfer to France after the
Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition in
January.  
 While Noriega was in jail in the U.S., a French court
convicted him in absentia of money laundering and sentenced him
to 10 years in jail. Under French law, he will have a new trial
now that he’s in custody in France.  
 Successive Panamanian governments have called on the U.S.
to extradite Noriega to stand trial in the Central American
nation, where he faces charges including the killing of army
officers.  
 Panama will respect Noriega’s extradition to France and
seek to prosecute him in Panamanian courts in “due time,”
Foreign Minister Juan Carlos Varela told reporters yesterday in
Panama City.
