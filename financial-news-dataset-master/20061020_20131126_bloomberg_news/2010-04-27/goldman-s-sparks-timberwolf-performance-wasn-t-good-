             Daniel Sparks, former head of 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s mortgage business, comments about a 
set of mortgage-linked investments sold by his firm that was 
called "one shi**y deal" in internal e-mails.  
 Sparks, responding to Michigan Senator Carl Levin's 
questioning during a Senate subcommittee hearing, said his 
performance on the transaction called Timberwolf Ltd. "wasn't 
good." (This is an excerpt from the Senate Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations hearing. Source: Bloomberg)
