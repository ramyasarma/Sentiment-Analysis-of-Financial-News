             Allianz SE isn’t raising company
contributions to the pension plans of about 50,000 employees
this year for financial reasons, Financial Times Deutschland
reported, citing an unidentified spokeswoman.  
 The insurer usually adds 3 percent to employees’ salaries
if they decide to participate in the pension plan, but that
percentage will drop this year as a result of the freeze, FTD
said. Higher expenses because of an aging population and lower
income from bonds are among the reasons for the decision, the
newspaper reported.
