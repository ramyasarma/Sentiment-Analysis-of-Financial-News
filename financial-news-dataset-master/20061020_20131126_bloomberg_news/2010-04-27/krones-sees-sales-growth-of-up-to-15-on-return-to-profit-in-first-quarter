             Krones AG, a German maker of
bottling and packaging equipment, returned to profit in the
first quarter and forecast “double-digit” sales growth this year
as an improving global economy lifts demand for its machinery.  
 Krones posted net income of 9.1 million euros ($12.1
million), after four consecutive quarters of losses, and said it
aims for net profit this year of at least the same magnitude as
last year’s loss. Sales grew 11 percent to 533.5 million euros,
and should rise at least 10 percent this year, according to co-
Chief Executive Officer Hans-Juergen Thaus.  
 “The lower threshold is 2 billion euros in sales this
year; we should come in well above that,” Thaus said in a
telephone interview. “We’ll also try to earn noticeably more
this year than the 35 million euros we lost in 2009.”  
 The manufacturer, whose clients including breweries and
soft-drink producers, posted a loss of 34.7 million euros last
year as sales fell 22 percent to 1.86 billion euros, and called
2009 the most difficult year in the company’s existence.  
 “Pricing behavior last year was not economically feasible,
but the situation is improving,” Thaus said.  
 Krones shares fell 1.13 euros, or 2.6 percent, to 42.38
euros at 2:25 p.m. in Frankfurt today for a market value of
1.34 billion euros.  
 Krones is anticipating more volatile trends in customer
orders by lowering fixed costs further and simplifying internal
processes, the CEO said in the text of a speech prepared for a
press conference today. Details on the program will be released
this fall, he said, adding Krones cut expenses by about 142
million euros last year, with about a third representing
permanent reductions.
