             Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc should remain in British government
ownership for 10 years, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman
Vince Cable said.  
 “These banks should remain effectively under public
control for something in the order of a decade,” Cable said in
an interview today as he traveled to campaign in the south coast
city of Southampton for the May 6 elections. “My primary
objective for the state-owned partly nationalized banks is to
make sure they support British business and recovery.”  
 Lloyds, 41 percent owned by the government, reported a
profit today for the first time since 2008 as bad loans
declined. Its shares rose. RBS, the biggest government-owned
bank, may return to profit in 2010, an analyst at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch said this month.  
 Cable’s party may hold the balance of power after the
election, which opinion polls suggest will give neither the
ruling Labour Party nor the main opposition Conservatives a
majority in the House of Commons. That might mean the Liberal
Democrats demanding acceptance of some of their policies in
return for providing support in Parliament.
