             Chile will seek an accord with the
Toronto Stock Exchange to allow mining companies to dual list
there and in Santiago as President Sebastian Pinera attempts to
boost exploration in the world’s largest copper producer.  
 Chilean officials met Toronto Exchange representatives
today seeking to match an accord the Canadian bourse currently
has with the Lima Stock Exchange, Chile Deputy Mining Minister
Pablo Wagner said today in an interview in Santiago.  
 Pinera’s government is seeking to allure the more than $300
billion held by pension funds, banks and local investors to
Chile’s mining industry, which dominates the country’s economy.
No company on Chile’s benchmark Ipsa stock index mines copper.  
 “We want to connect this market with the mining
industry,” Wagner said. “We want to encourage exploring in
Chile and analyze new incentives.”  
 State-owned copper producer Codelco will use government
funds and external bond markets to finance $15 billion in
planned projects over the next seven years. Foreign miners
active in Chile such as BHP Billiton Ltd. and Anglo American Plc
get project financing from outside of Chile.
