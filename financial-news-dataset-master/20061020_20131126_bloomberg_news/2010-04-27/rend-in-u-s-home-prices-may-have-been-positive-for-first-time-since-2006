             The trend in U.S. home prices
probably turned up in February for the first time in more than
three years, and consumers became less pessimistic this month as
the jobs picture brightened, economists projected reports today
will show.  
 The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
climbed 1.3 percent from February 2009, the first year-over-year
gain since December 2006, according to the median forecast of 22
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. A report from the
Conference Board may show sentiment improved for a second month.  
 Home prices in January were 30 percent below the peak
reached in July 2006, indicating the industry that helped
trigger the worst recession since the 1930s will take years to
recover lost ground. A pickup in employment is needed to help
stem the damage from mounting foreclosures and to sustain recent
gains in household spending.  
 “The bottom has been reached in home prices and we’re now
seeing gradual improvement,” said Joel Naroff, president of
Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. in Holland, Pennsylvania. “Prices
will move upward but we’re not going to get spectacular gains
any time soon because of all the troubled houses out there.”  
 The S&P/Case-Shiller figures, due at 9 a.m., would follow a
0.7 percent year-over-year drop in January. Bloomberg survey
forecasts ranged from a decline of 0.8 percent to an increase of
1.6 percent. Year-over-year records began in 2001.  
 Year-Over-Year  
 While the data also include month-to-month changes in
prices adjusted for seasonal variations, it’s best to focus on
the year-over-year trends, the group charged with issuing the
report said on April 20. The panel includes Karl Case and Robert
Shiller, the economists who created the gauges.  
 The seasonally adjusted and unadjusted series “have given
conflicting signals” recently, with the former rising while the
latter fell, the group said in a statement. The turmoil in
housing in the past few years has influenced the models used in
adjusting the data, “resulting in larger seasonal adjustments
and misleading results,” according to the group.  
 The New York-based Conference Board’s sentiment index is
due at 10 a.m. The gauge probably rose to 53.5 from 52.5 in
March, according to the survey median. Estimates ranged from 48
to 57, and the measure averaged 98 during the economic expansion
that ended in December 2007.  
 “Once people feel there’s more job security, consumer
confidence will come back up faster,” Naroff said. “We need
faster employment growth.”  
 Payroll Gains  
 Employers in the world’s largest economy added workers to
payrolls in March for the third time in the past five months,
according to figures from the Labor Department.  
 Reflecting the stabilization in housing, the Standard &
Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilder index, which includes Pulte
Group Inc. and Lennar Corp., has gained 26 percent this year
compared with a 8.7 percent rise in the broader S&P 500 Index.  
 Prices may improve in coming months as homebuyers rush to
take advantage of a government tax credit worth as much as
$8,000 before it expires. Purchase contracts must be signed by
the end of this week and transactions need to close by the end
of June in order for buyers to be eligible.  
 Growing demand may help offset the pressure on prices from
mounting foreclosures. Filings jumped 16 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, and bank seizures reached a record,
according to Irvine, California-based RealtyTrac Inc.
Foreclosures push up the number of homes on the market, forcing
builders and sellers to make concessions to get deals done.  
 Some businesses see better prospects. M.D.C. Holdings Inc.,
the Denver-based builder of Richmond American Homes, said its
loss narrowed in the first quarter from a year earlier as orders
jumped 38 percent.  
 “While this trend is encouraging, we remain cautious due
to the impending expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit
and depressed overall economic conditions,” Chief Executive
Officer Larry Mizel said in an April 23 statement.

      The percentage of businesses planning on increasing staff in the next six months exceeded the share projecting more firings by 21 points, up from 6 points in January. Twenty-four percent of the respondents estimated the economy will grow faster than 3 percent this year. (Source: Bloomberg)
