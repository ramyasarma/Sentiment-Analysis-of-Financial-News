             Argentina will by the end of this
week present the prospectus for its plan to restructure $20
billion in defaulted bonds held out of a 2005 settlement, 
Finance Secretary Hernan Lorenzino said.
    “By the end of this week we’ll launch the offer, which will
begin next week,” Lorenzino said in a telephone interview in
Buenos Aires. Argentine officials will travel to meet with
investors in New York next week, he said.
