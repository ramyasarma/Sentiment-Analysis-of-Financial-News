             Shares in Nigerian banks are not
barred from being used as collateral for margin-loan lenders in
the country, the central bank said.  
 The Central Bank of Nigeria has set a 10 percent limit on
how much of a bank’s total portfolio can be used for margin
lending, according to a statement posted on the Abuja-based
bank’s Web site dated yesterday. The new rules were approved on
April 15.  
 The “large exposure of banks to the capital market was a
major contributor to the recent banking crisis,” the bank said.  
 Nigeria’s central bank and Securities and Exchange
Commission are working on rules to guide margin lending, the
statement said without providing further details.  
 Nigerian banks faced collapse last year, forcing the
central bank to fire the chief executive officers of eight
lenders and inject 620 billion naira ($4.1 billion) into the
industry.  
 Nigerian banks may have as much as $10 billion in toxic
assets, Eurasia Group, a New York-based research company, said
last year. The bad debt is partly the result of at least 1
trillion naira of margin loans used to buy shares, according to
Bank of America Corp.  
 The Nigerian Stock Exchange’s All-Share Index fell almost
34 percent in 2009, making it the world’s second-worst performer
after Ghana, and has risen 26 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg data.
