             Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney
said there is nothing “pre-ordained” about interest-rate
moves.  
 Carney reiterated that he plans to raise his key lending
rate from a record low 0.25 percent because of faster-than-
expected economic growth, in testimony today to the House of
Commons finance committee.  
 “It is appropriate to begin to lessen the degree of
monetary stimulus,” Carney said in his opening statement. He
added that dropping a “conditional commitment” to keep the
policy rate unchanged through June represents a tightening of
monetary policy. “Going forward, nothing is pre-ordained.”  
 The Canadian dollar and interest rates increased after the
bank’s April 20 policy statement signaled borrowing costs would
rise, as some investors bet the move could come at the next
decision on June 1. An increase in June could be the first by a
Group of Seven central bank since a global recession last year.  
 Carney also repeated that households need to watch their
debt levels as interest rates begin to rise, and that some
people may be “over-extended.” He also said he expects a
“marked slowdown” in the housing market.  
 Asked what he felt was the main risk to the global
recovery, Carney spoke about fiscal challenges in many
countries, including the U.S.
