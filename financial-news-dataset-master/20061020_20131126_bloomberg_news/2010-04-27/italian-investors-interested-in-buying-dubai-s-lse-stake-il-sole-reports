             Italian investors are interested in
Borse Dubai Ltd.’s 20.6 percent stake in London Stock Exchange
Group Plc, Il Sole 24 Ore reported, without saying where it got
the information.  
 Banks in the country may group their shares, which account
for 18 percent of LSE, and an “investment vehicle” such as
Italian fund F2i may buy LSE shares, according to the newspaper.
F2i hasn’t received any “concrete” request to get involved in
a transaction, Il Sole reported.
