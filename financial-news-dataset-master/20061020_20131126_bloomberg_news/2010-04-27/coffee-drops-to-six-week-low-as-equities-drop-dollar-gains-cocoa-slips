             Coffee futures dropped to a six-
week low in New York as equities declined and the dollar rose,
eroding the investment appeal of some raw materials. Cocoa also
declined.  
 U.S. stocks slipped and the dollar rose to a one-month high
against a basket of six currencies. Demand for riskier assets
diminished on concern that the debt crisis in Europe will widen,
after Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating to junk. The
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities fell as much as 2
percent, heading for the biggest decline since February.  
 “As the stock market is trading lower, people are looking
at that precisely and a higher dollar and just taking money
out,” said Hector Galvan, a senior trading adviser at RJO
Futures in Chicago.  
 Arabica coffee for July delivery fell 1.8 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $1.3085 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. Earlier, the
price touched $1.302, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since March 15. Prices have dropped 3.8 percent this
year.  
 “We’ve been chopping around the last five to seven
sessions, people don’t really have something to hold onto,”
Galvan said. “They are holding onto the outside markets.”  
 In the week ended April 20, hedge-fund managers and other
large speculators lowered their net-long position, or bets on
rising prices, by 52 percent, the biggest decline since March
2009, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data.  
 Robusta coffee for July delivery fell $43, or 3.2 percent,
to $1,285 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in London.  
 In another market, cocoa for July delivery slipped $23, or
0.7 percent, to $3,205 a ton on ICE in New York, the first
decline since April 19.
