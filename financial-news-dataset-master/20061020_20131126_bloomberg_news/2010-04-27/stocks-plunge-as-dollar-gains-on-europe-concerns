             Stocks tumbled, with Europe’s
benchmark index sliding the most since November, while the
dollar and Treasuries rallied, as credit-ratings cuts on Greek
and Portugal spurred concern that indebted European nations are
moving closer to default.   
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 2.7 percent at 11:33 a.m.
in New York, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1.6
percent. Crude oil sank 1.7 percent, while copper plunged 2.7
percent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note tumbled 13 basis
points to 3.68 percent, while the Dollar Index rallied 0.5
percent to 81.881.
