             Rio Tinto Group, the third-largest
mine operator, may be a more attractive takeover target for BHP
Billiton Ltd. than when the world’s biggest mining business bid
for the company in 2007, according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  
 BHP Chief Executive Officer Marius Kloppers scrapped the
$66 billion offer in November 2008 because of falling commodity
prices and Rio’s debt. Antitrust regulators are still reviewing
the companies’ subsequent accord to combine Western Australian
iron ore assets in a venture to save more than $10 billion.  
 “From a BHP perspective the acquisition of Rio is as
workable and as strategically justifiable as it was in 2007, if
not more so,” Andrew Keen, an analyst at HSBC in London, wrote
today in a note. “Rio is now a more attractive proposition with
less debt and less downstream aluminum assets.”  
 One scenario is the venture “is likely to fail regulatory
approval, and this will be a catalyst for BHP to revisit the
acquisition of Rio,” he said.  
 Rio declined 3.4 percent to 3,676.5 pence by 11:56 a.m. in
London. BHP, the world’s biggest mining company, dropped 2.2
percent to 2,104.5 pence. Shares of both companies also trade on
the Australian stock exchange. London-based Rio has a market
valuation of 84 billion pounds ($129 billion).  
 BHP, based in Melbourne, originally offered three of its
shares for every Rio share in November 2007 before raising its
bid to 3.4 shares for each Rio share.  
 The equivalent ratio is now 2.22 BHP shares for each Rio
share given adjustments for a $15.2 billion share sale last year
by Rio, HSBC said in the note. The current market ratio is 1.8
BHP shares for each Rio share meaning a similar bid would be at
a 27 percent premium to Rio’s share price, it said.  
 Christina Mills, a London-based spokeswoman for Rio Tinto,
declined to comment. BHP spokesman Ruban Yogarajah didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment.
