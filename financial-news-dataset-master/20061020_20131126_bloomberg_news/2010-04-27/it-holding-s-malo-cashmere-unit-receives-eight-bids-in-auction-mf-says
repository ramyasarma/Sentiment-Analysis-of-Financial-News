             IT Holding SpA’s Malo cashmere
brand received eight offers at an auction, daily MF reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 Seven of the offers were from Italian investors, including
one from private equity fund Opera, according to the Italian
newspaper. The only non-Italian bid may have been from Ningxia
Zhongyin Cashmere Co., MF said.  
 The Cruciani Group and Carlyle Group didn’t take part in
the auction, MF reported. A decision on the sale may be made by
June 3.
