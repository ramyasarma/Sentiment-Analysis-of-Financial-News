             Sharp Corp., Japan’s largest maker
of liquid-crystal displays, said it expects profit to rise more
than 11-fold this year as sales of 3-D panels climb.  
 Net income will probably jump to 50 billion yen ($533
million) in the year ending March 31, 2011, the company said
today in a statement, compared with 4.4 billion yen in the
previous year. Sales may rise 13 percent to 3.1 trillion yen.  
 Sharp has said it plans to start selling televisions and
small screens that can show 3-D images by Sept. 30 to meet
consumer demand. The 3-D display market, including those used in
mobile phones and notebook personal computers, will grow about
38 percent a year, climbing to $22 billion by 2018, researcher
DisplaySearch said in January.  
 “We expect the company to leverage its position as a panel
maker by selling its high-quality panels to consumer electronics
makers for 3-D TV models,” Michiko Kakiya, an analyst at
Macquarie Group Ltd., said in an April 20 report. Sharp should
to find customers for its 3-D panels as soon as possible, she
said. She rates the shares “outperform.”  
 Sharp rose 2 percent to 1,254 yen in Tokyo trading today
before the earnings announcement, their highest close since Sept.
10, 2008. The shares have gained 7.5 percent this year,
outperforming a 6.3 percent advance by the benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average.  
 Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, will probably more than double to 120
billion yen for the year started April 1, the company said.
The median of 26 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for
110 billion yen on revenue of 2.9 trillion yen.  
 Sharp recorded net income of 4.4 billion yen in the year
ended March 2010, lower than the 5.9 billion yen average of 24
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Japanese maker had
forecast a profit of 3 billion yen for the year.
