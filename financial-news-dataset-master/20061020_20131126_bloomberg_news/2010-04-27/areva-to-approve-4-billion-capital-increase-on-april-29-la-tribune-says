             Areva SA’s board is set to approve
a 3 billion-euro capital increase at a meeting on April 29,
French daily La Tribune reported, without citing anyone.  
 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and the sovereign wealth
funds of Kuwait and Qatar will each take stakes of about 5
percent, the newspaper said.  
 A report on France’s civil nuclear capability by Francois
Roussely will be published on May 5, the newspaper said. La
Tribune didn’t say how it obtained the date, which, it added,
wasn’t confirmed by the the president’s office.
