             Italy may struggle to sell two-year
notes at an auction today as investors judge the securities
expensive given the concern about fiscal strains in the euro
region, according to Nomura International Plc.  
 “Italian debt has so far remained unscathed relative to
some of its southern European counterparts,” Charles Diebel,
the senior fixed-income strategist at Nomura in London, wrote in
an e-mailed report today. “Yet this 2012 issue is likely to
come at comparatively rich levels. This should be a clear test
of the solidity of demand against what remains a very uncertain
backdrop and could be something of a wake-up call to investors
who may be ignoring true macro developments.”
