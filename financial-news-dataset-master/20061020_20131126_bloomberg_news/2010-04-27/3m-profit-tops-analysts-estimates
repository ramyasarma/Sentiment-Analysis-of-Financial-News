             3M Co., the maker of 55,000
products from dental implants to Post-It Notes, reported first-
quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates and raised its
full-year forecast as sales rose in all divisions.  
 Net income increased 80 percent to $930 million, or $1.29 a
share, from $518 million, or 74 cents, a year earlier, the St.
Paul, Minnesota-based company said today in a statement. Profit
excluding one-time items was $1.40 a share, beating the $1.21
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Sales climbed 25 percent to $6.35 billion, also topping
projections, with gains of at least 12 percent in the six main
units and a 47 percent surge from emerging economies. 3M is an
economic bellwether because of its product range, which spans
the automotive, consumer, energy and health-care markets.  
 “Call it an amazing performance,” Nicholas Heymann and
other Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. analysts wrote in a note to
clients. “3M has been on a tear over the past four reporting
periods, consistently shattering expectations about pace and
magnitude by which its operating earnings have been able to
sharply recover from extraordinarily weak year earlier
comparisons.”  
 Full-year profit now may be $5.40 to $5.60 a share,
excluding costs for a change in health-care benefit tax law, the
company said. That’s higher than 3M’s January outlook of $4.90
to $5.10 a share and the average estimate of $5.16 a share.
Organic sales volumes may rise 10 percent to 12 percent instead
of the prior estimate of 5 percent to 7 percent.  
 3M rose $2.12, or 2.4 percent, to $89.56 at 10:10 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares climbed 5.8
percent this year before today.  
 Unit Results  
 Chief Executive Officer George Buckley in January predicted
continued strong demand in 3M’s health-care and display and
graphics units. He has cut costs by trimming about 6,400 jobs
since the start of 2008.  
 The company’s operating income margin was 22.8 percent, a
gain of 7 percentage points from a year earlier. “I can think
of no better way to refute some of the ‘collapsing-margin’
Doubting Thomases out there,” Buckley said on a conference call
with analysts.  
 Sales rose 42 percent to $869 million in 3M’s Displays and
Graphics unit and 29 percent to $2.07 billion in Industrial and
Transportation, the largest business. The health-care unit had a
12 percent increase to $1.12 billion.  
 “The company’s focus on innovation really showed itself
this quarter with strong top line performance,” Joel Levington,
a managing director of corporate credit for Brookfield
Investment Management Inc. in New York, said in an e-mail. “The
key for investors will be 3M’s ability to continue to develop
unique products that can keep revenue growth healthy.”
