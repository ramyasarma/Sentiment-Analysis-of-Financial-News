             Rents for the best office buildings
in Abu Dhabi fell for the sixth straight quarter as new
developments increased the amount of available space, CB Richard
Ellis Group Inc. said.  
 The average rent for prime properties fell 12 percent to
2,300 dirhams ($626) a square meter in the first quarter from
the previous three months, the Los Angeles-based real-estate
broker said in a report published today. The vacancy rate
increased by about 2 percent, versus an average of less than 1
percent in recent years.  
 “Landlords are becoming more and more anxious to fill
their developments and to avoid long void periods,” Matthew
Green and Arlene Jimenea wrote in the report. “The shift in
market dynamics is now resulting in increased tenant incentives,
and more generous leasing terms for occupiers.”  
 New office projects on Al Sowwah and Al Reem islands will
add to the amount of office space in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab
Emirates’ capital. A rent cap of 5 percent introduced by the
government in the first quarter also benefited tenants, CB
Richard Ellis said.  
 Abu Dhabi home prices have dropped by an average of 40
percent from their peak in the third quarter of 2008, Jimenea
said in response to e-mailed questions. Some homebuyers have
struggled to obtain mortgages from banks that are reluctant to
lend.  
 “The sales market remains muted as financing and other
credit facility remain tight,” Jimenea said.
