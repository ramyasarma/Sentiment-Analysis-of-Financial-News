             BP Plc’s response to the oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico was “very, very aggressive” and the
company is determined to prevent an environmental disaster,
Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward said.  
 The company will spend about $100 million to drill a relief
well where oil is spewing from the seabed even if it stops the
1,000 barrel-a-day leak with remote-operated vehicles. Drilling
will be the most expensive part of BP’s response, Hayward said.  
 Hayward is facing his biggest challenge since taking the
helm in 2007 after an explosion cause BP-leased oil rig
Deepwater Horizon to catch fire and sink last week. The spill
now stretches across 80 miles of the Gulf of Mexico, menacing
the shorelines of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.  
 “We are being very, very aggressive,” Hayward said in a
telephone conference from Washington with journalists in London
today. “This is the biggest response by anyone in the industry
ever, and we’re able to do it because we planned for it. We will
be judged by our response.”  
 Hayward has spent his first three years in charge trying to
restore the company’s reputation for safety following a fatal
explosion at the Texas City, Texas, refinery in 2005. The rig
accident may cost insurers and reinsurers $1.6 billion,
according to an estimate by JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 “We are determined to ensure that it does not become a
major environmental incident,” Hayward said.
