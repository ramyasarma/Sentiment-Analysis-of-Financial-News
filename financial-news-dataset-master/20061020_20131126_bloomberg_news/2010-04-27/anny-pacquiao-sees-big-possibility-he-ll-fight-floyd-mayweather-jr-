             Boxing champion Manny Pacquiao said
there’s a “big possibility” he’ll fight Floyd Mayweather Jr.
should both come through their respective challenges next month.  
 Pacquiao is campaigning for a seat in the Philippine
Congress in elections scheduled for May 10, nine days after
Mayweather fights Shane Mosley for the World Boxing Association
welterweight title in Las Vegas.  
 “There’s that big possibility,” Pacquiao said in an
interview yesterday in Manila when asked whether the fight would
go ahead if Mayweather beats Mosley and he is elected. “My
mother wants me to retire from boxing; it’s 50-50 at this
point.”  
 A fight between Pacquiao, holder of the World Boxing
Organization welterweight title, and the undefeated American
would be among the sport’s biggest draws, pairing two fighters
ranked as the top two pound-for-pound boxers by The Ring
magazine. Talks for the bout collapsed earlier this year when
the two sides couldn’t agree on drug-testing procedures.  
 The Filipino went on to defend his WBO belt against Ghana’s
Joshua Clottey on March 14.  
 Pacquiao, 31, said March 22 that he was considering ending
his career without fighting Mayweather. He has said he doesn’t
need to face the 33-year-old American to cement his legacy in
boxing, where he has a 51-3-2 record with 38 knockouts.  
 Pacquiao won his first world title as a flyweight in 1998
and 11 years later defeated Miguel Cotto for the welterweight
title he still holds. He lost a bid for the Philippine
legislature in 2007 and is running again in this year’s election.  
 A Mayweather fight would be his last before retiring,
Pacquiao said yesterday. “I will discuss this with the entire
family,” he said.
