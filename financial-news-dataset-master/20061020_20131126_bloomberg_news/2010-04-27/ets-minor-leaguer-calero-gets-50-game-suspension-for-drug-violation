             Angel Calero, a minor league
pitcher in the New York Mets’ organization, received a 50-game
suspension from Major League Baseball for taking a performance-
enhancing substance.  
 Calero, a 23-year-old left-hander, violated the Minor
League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program by testing positive
for metabolites of nandrolone, baseball said in a news release.  
 Calero was with Class-A St. Lucie of the Florida State
League, posting a 1-1 record with a 5.68 earned run average in
four relief appearances.  
 Major League Baseball also said Socrates Brito, a free
agent outfielder, received a 50-game ban after testing positive
for metabolites of Stanozolol, a performance-enhancing
substance. His suspension will be effective immediately after
signing with a major-league organization.
