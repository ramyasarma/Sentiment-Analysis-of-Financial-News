             Portugal had its credit rating cut
two steps by Standard & Poor’s as contagion from Greece’s debt
crisis spreads through the euro region.  
 S&P lowered its long-term local and foreign currency
ratings to A- from A+, it said in a statement today. The outlook
on Portugal is negative, reflecting the risk of a further
downgrade, it said. Greece today had its rating cut to junk by
Standard & Poor’s, which cited the political and budgetary 
challenges that the government in Athens faces.  
 The risk premium investors demand to hold Portuguese bonds
surged to the highest in more than a decade as the government
struggles to convince investors it can cut the budget deficit
and won’t need help from European partners as Greece has.
Portugal, whose economy has barely grown for a decade, had a
shortfall of 9.4 percent of gross domestic product last year,
more than three times the European Union limit.  
 The move “reflects our view of the amplified fiscal risks
Portugal faces,” S&P said in the statement. “We expect the
Portuguese government could struggle to stabilize its relatively
high debt ratio over the outlook horizon until 2013.”  
 The amount of debt as a proportion of GDP that Portugal has
to refinance this year is one of the highest in the euro region,
which coupled with the high deficit leaves the country
“vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment,” S&P said.  
 Spread Widens  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold Portuguese debt
rather than German equivalents surged to 259 basis points today,
the highest since at least 1997. The Greek spread widened to 673
basis points.  
 “The biggest risk now is that the market speculates
against every single indebted peripheral country, and that could
lead to a sovereign debt crisis,” said Axel Botte, strategist
at AXA Investment Managers in Paris. “The contagion risk is
real. It’s much easier to bail out a bank than to bail out a
country.”  
 Portugal’s financing costs are surging as its biggest debt
maturity of the year approaches. The government needs to raise
funds to pay back 5.9 billion euros ($7.8 billion) of 10-year
bonds on May 20, its largest maturity until April 2011, when 6
billion euros of bonds come due.  
 While Portugal’s public debt of 77 percent of GDP is on a
par with that of France, the economy has averaged annual growth
of less than 1 percent for the last decade. S&P said it will
take until 2012 for the real GDP growth rate to return to 1
percent and expects the government debt burden to rise to 95
percent of GDP in 2013.  
 S&P forecast Portugal’s deficit would amount to 4.1 percent
of GDP in 2013, missing the government’s aim to get it to 2.8
percent, below the EU’s 3 percent limit.  
 Portugal is rated Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service and AA-
by Fitch Ratings.
