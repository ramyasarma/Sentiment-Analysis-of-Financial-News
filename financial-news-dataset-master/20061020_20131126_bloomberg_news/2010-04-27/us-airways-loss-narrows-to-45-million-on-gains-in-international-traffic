             US Airways Group Inc., the smallest
of the U.S. full-fare carriers, said its first-quarter loss
narrowed to $45 million as it flew more passengers on
international routes.  
 The net loss shrank to 28 cents a share from $103 million,
or 90 cents, a year earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based company
said in a statement today. Sales increased 7.9 percent to
$2.65 billion.  
 An increase in travel outside the U.S., where carriers
don’t compete with low-fare airlines, helped overcome higher
fuel prices during the quarter. Traffic in miles flown by paying
passengers rose 12 percent on routes across the Atlantic and
9.3 percent to Latin America, the carrier has said. US Airways’
total slipped 1.9 percent from a year earlier.  
 Excluding what the company considers one-time costs and
gains, the loss was $89 million, or 55 cents a share. On that
basis, US Airways was expected to report a loss of 71 cents, the
average from 7 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
