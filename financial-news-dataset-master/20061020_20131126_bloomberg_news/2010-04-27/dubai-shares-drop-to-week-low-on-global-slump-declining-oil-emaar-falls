             Dubai shares declined to the lowest
level in almost a week, leading a drop in the United Arab
Emirates, as oil fell for a second day and concern deepened that
Europe’s debt crisis is spreading.  
 Emaar Properties PJSC, the developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper in Dubai, declined for a second day. Dubai Islamic
Bank PJSC, the U.A.E.’s biggest Islamic lender, lost the most
since April 19. The DFM General Index slid 0.6 percent to
1,747.06, bringing the drop this month to 5.2 percent. Abu
Dhabi’s ADX General Index retreated 0.3 percent to 2,803.16, the
lowest in seven weeks.  
 European stocks fell after German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said yesterday she won’t release funds to help Greece shore up
its finances until the nation has a “sustainable” plan to reduce
its budget deficit. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined for the
third time in four days, as concern deepened China’s steps to
cool its property market will curb growth in the world’s third-
largest economy. The MSCI World Index lost 0.6 percent at 5:10
p.m. in Dubai.  
 “Weak international sentiment” isn’t helping, said Ali
Khan, head of cash-equity trading at Dubai-based Arqaam Capital
Ltd.  
 Crude oil for June delivery dropped 1 percent to $83.37 a
barrel, bringing the two-day decline to 2.1 percent. The six
nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council supply about a fifth of
the world’s oil.  
 Emaar declined 2 percent, the most since April 19, to 3.88
dirhams. Dubai Islamic Bank slid 1.8 percent to 2.24 dirhams.  
 Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index slipped 0.3 percent.
Oman’s MSM30 Index dropped 0.2 percent and Qatar’s measure lost
0.1 percent. Bahrain’s gauge increased 0.7 percent and the
Kuwait Stock Exchange Index gained 0.8 percent, the most in more
than two months.
