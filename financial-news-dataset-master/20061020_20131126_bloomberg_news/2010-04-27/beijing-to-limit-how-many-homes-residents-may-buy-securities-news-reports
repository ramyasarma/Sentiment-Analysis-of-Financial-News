             The city of Beijing will issues
policies today limiting how many homes residents of the Chinese
capital are allowed to buy, the Shanghai Securities News
reported today, citing an unidentified person.  
 The city will also “basically” stop loans for the
purchase of third homes, as well as loans for those originally
from outside Beijing who haven’t paid a year’s tax in the
Chinese capital, the Shanghai-based newspaper reported.
