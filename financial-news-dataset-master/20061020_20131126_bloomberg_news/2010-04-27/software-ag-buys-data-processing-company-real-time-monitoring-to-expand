             Software AG, Germany’s second-
largest software maker, bought Real Time Monitoring GmbH for a
“single-digit” million-euro figure to keep expanding, Chief
Executive Officer Karl-Heinz Streibich said.  
 “We are in principle always ready for acquisitions,”
Streibich said in an interview from Frankfurt today. There won’t
be any big purchases any time soon “but smaller ones like RTM
we will always need and always do.”  
 Real Time Monitoring, based in Marburg, Germany, helps
companies to process and analyse high-volume data. Software AG
bought IDS Scheer in July, trebling the number of clients and
expanding into services for products from SAP AG, the world’s
biggest maker of business management software. It was the
largest purchase in Software AG’s 40-year history.  
 Software AG said today that first-quarter net income rose
to 28 million euros ($37.4 million) from 25.65 million euros in
the same period a year earlier. Revenue increased 51 percent to
250.3 million euros as sales outside Europe, especially in the
U.S., picked up, Streibich said. The company reiterated that
sales will rise by as much as 30 percent and net income gain 8
percent to 12 percent this year.
