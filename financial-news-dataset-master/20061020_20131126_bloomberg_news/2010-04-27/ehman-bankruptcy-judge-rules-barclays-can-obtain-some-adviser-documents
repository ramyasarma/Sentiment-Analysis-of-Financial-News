             A bankruptcy judge ruled that
Barclays Plc may seek documents from the advisers to creditors
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to defend itself in a trial in
which Lehman is trying to recover an alleged windfall of $11
billion Barclays reaped after it acquired Lehman assets.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck approved Barclays’ motion
to obtain documents from Lehman’s creditors’ financial advisers
FTI and Houlihan Lokey. He denied Barclays’ motion to release
documents from accounting firm Deloitte & Touche and
restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal, advisers to Lehman and the
trustee overseeing its liquidation.  
 “Barclays has failed to demonstrate any substantial need”
for the denied documents, Peck said at a hearing today in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  
 Barclays was seeking the advisers’ economic analysis of the
sale of Lehman’s brokerage firm, headquarters and other assets
between September 2008, when the deal was made, and March 2009.  
 Lehman and the advisers refused to provide the documents on
the basis of an “attorney work product” privilege.
