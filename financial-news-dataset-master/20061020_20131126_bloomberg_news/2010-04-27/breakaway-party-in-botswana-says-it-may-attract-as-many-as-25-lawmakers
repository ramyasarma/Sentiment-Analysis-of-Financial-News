             A breakaway group from the ruling
Botswana Democratic Party may attract as many as 25 members of
parliament, making it the single largest party in the
legislature, said one of the group’s leaders, Kabo Morwaeng.  
 “Just wait and see, some BDP MPs and councilors are not
happy where they are and this could be as many as 25 MPs,”
Morwaeng said in an interview in Gaborone today.  
 The ruling party won 44 of the 57 seats contested in
elections last year.  
 The party will be called the Botswana Movement for
Democracy, Sydney Pilane, a spokesman for the group, said by
telephone today in the capital, Gaborone.
