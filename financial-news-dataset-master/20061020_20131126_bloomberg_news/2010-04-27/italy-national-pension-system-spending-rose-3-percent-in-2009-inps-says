             Pension spending rose 3 percent
last year with almost a quarter of Italians receiving either
retirement or disability support, the country’s welfare and
pension agency INPS said.  
 Italy’s government paid about 18.6 million pensions in
2009, with total spending climbing to 173.1 billion euros ($231
billion) from 168 billion euros the previous year, INPS said in
its annual report released in Rome today.  
 Italians have among the longest life expectancy in Europe,
with men living on average until 79 and women until over 84, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a
Feb. 16 report. As Italy faces a short-term risk of
“generational imbalances,” Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s
government must change the pension system, including raising the
retirement age, the International Monetary Fund recommended in a
March 30 report.  
 Demand for unemployment benefits jumped to 6.3 billion
euros in 2009 from 4.5 billion euros the previous year, INPS
said. The IMF forecast Italy’s unemployment rate, already at the
highest level since at least 2004, will rise to 8.7 percent in
2010 before falling to 8.6 in 2011.
