             A Chinese electronics maker said it
filed lawsuits to block the sales of some Hewlett-Packard Co.
and Toshiba Corp. laptop computers in the world’s third-biggest
economy, alleging the products had infringed its patents.  
 Beijing Huaqi Information Digital Technology Co. has filed
a complaint against Hewlett-Packard at the First Intermediate
People’s Court in Beijing, Lu Ersong, a lawyer representing the
Chinese company, said by phone today. Beijing Huaqi, which uses
the Aigo brand name, is also pursuing a suit against Toshiba at
a court in the city of Xian, western China, Lu said.  
 Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba each face a claim to pay 1
million yuan ($146,500) in compensation for allegedly offering
products that include Aigo’s USB Plus adapter technology, Lu
said. The Chinese company also plans to begin legal action
against other computer makers for similar infringements, he said.  
 “HP refutes the alleged patent infringement claims made by
Aigo,” according to an e-mailed statement from the Palo Alto,
California-based company today. Toshiba hasn’t received Aigo’s
complaint and declined to comment, Keisuke Ohmori, a Tokyo-based
spokesman, said by phone today.  
 Aigo’s legal action was earlier reported by the Financial
Times.
