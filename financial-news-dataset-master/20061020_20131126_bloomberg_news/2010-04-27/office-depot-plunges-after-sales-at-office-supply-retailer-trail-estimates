             Office Depot Inc., the second-
largest U.S. office-supply retailer, sank the most since October
2008 in New York trading after reporting first-quarter sales
that fell more than analysts estimated.  
 Sales declined 4.8 percent to $3.07 billion in the three
months ended March 27 from a year earlier, the Boca Raton,
Florida-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
expected revenue of $3.14 billion, the average of 15 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales at established stores have declined
2 percent so far this month, the company said today in a
conference call with analysts.  
 “Office Depot’s Achilles’ heel has been their sales
growth,” Brian Nagel, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. in New
York, said in a telephone interview. “If you look at their
sales today, they are still losing market share.” He rates the
shares “underperform.”  
 The retailer has posted nine consecutive quarters of sales
declines, dating back to the first quarter of 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Office Depot faces increased
competition from larger rival Staples Inc. and discounters such
as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp.  
 Office Depot dropped $1.89, or 21 percent, to $7.06 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 9.5 percent this year.  
 Net income in the first quarter totaled $29.5 million, or 7
cents a share, compared with a loss of $54.7 million, or 20
cents, a year earlier, the company said. Analyst expected an 8-
cent profit, the average of 19 estimates.  
 California Drop  
 Sales at the company’s North American business solutions
unit, which delivers products and services to businesses and
governments, fell 9.1 percent, the most of its three units, to
$830.6 million from a year earlier. Revenue from California, one
of its top two markets, dropped double digits, the company said.  
 “With the budget deficit and government mandated three-
day-per-month furloughs for state employees in place, it looks
like our business in California could be affected for an
extended period,” Steven Schmidt, president of the North
American solutions unit, said on the conference call.
