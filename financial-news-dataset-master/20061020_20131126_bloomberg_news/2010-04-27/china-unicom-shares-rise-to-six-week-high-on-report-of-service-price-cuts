             China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., the
country’s second-biggest provider of mobile-phone service, rose
to the highest in six weeks in Hong Kong trading today after a
newspaper reported that the carrier may cut handset prices and
call fees to boost demand.  
 Unicom shares rose as much as 3.5 percent to HK$9.56, the
highest since March 8, and traded at HK$9.47 as of 2:31 p.m.
local time. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 1.4
percent.  
 China Unicom may reduce prices for Apple Inc.’s iPhone
handset by 1,000 yuan, China Business News reported today,
citing an unidentified person at the carrier. Call rates for
subscribers of high-speed services may also be cut, the report
said.
