             Air China Ltd. fell the most since
December 2008, leading declines for airlines, on speculation
institutional investors are selling the shares for profit amid
concern tightening measures may slow economic growth.  
 Air China dropped 7.5 percent to 12.78 yuan at 11:01 a.m.
local time in Shanghai trading. The shares had rallied 42
percent this year before today. China Eastern Airlines Corp.
fell 4.8 percent to 9.22 yuan.  
 “Some institutional investors are selling for lack of
confidence in economy,” said Li Lei, an analyst at China
Securities Co. in Beijing. “The government is announcing
tightening policies like the ones on property. That will slow
down the economic growth and hurt investors’ sentiment. Airlines
account for quite a big proportion of institutional investors’
portfolios and they have made quite a lot of profit. Some
investors decided it’s time to sell.”
