             HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Executive
Officer Michael Geoghegan said the bank’s first-quarter results
met expectations, Radio Television of Hong Kong reported.  
 HSBC has finished preparations for a proposed stock market
listing in Shanghai and is still awaiting regulatory approval,
RTHK cited Geoghegan as saying in a report posted on its Web
site today.  
 Geoghegan also denied a media report that HSBC plans to bid
for Korea Exchange Bank, RTHK said. Seoul Economic Daily said
April 21 that Standard Chartered Plc and London-based HSBC are
among companies that have expressed an interest in buying a
controlling stake in the Korean bank, without citing anyone.  
 HSBC’s Hong Kong-based spokeswoman Annie Cheng didn’t
immediately return calls from Bloomberg News seeking comment.
