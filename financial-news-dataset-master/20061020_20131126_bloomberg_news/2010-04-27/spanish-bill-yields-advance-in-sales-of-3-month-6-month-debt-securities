             Spain and Italy’s borrowing costs
rose as the nations sold 12 billion euros ($16 billion) of
bills.  
 Spain sold 1.7 billion euros of six-month securities to
yield 0.736 percent today, up from 0.482 percent at a sale on
March 23. It also issued 936 million euros of three-month bills
yielding 0.515 percent, compared with 0.324 percent at a March
23 sale.  
 Italy issued 9.5 billion euros of six-month notes at a
yield of 0.814 percent, from 0.568 percent at a March 26 sale.
The bid-to-cover ratio, a measure of demand for the securities,
fell to 1.02, from 1.56 in the previous sale.
