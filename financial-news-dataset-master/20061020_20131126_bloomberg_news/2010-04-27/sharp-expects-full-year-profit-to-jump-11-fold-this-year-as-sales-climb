             Sharp Corp., Japan’s largest maker
of liquid-crystal displays, said it expects profit to rise more
than 11-fold this year as sales climb.  
 Net income will probably jump to 50 billion yen ($533
million) in the year ending March 31, 2011, the company said
today in a statement, compared with 4.4 billion yen in the
previous year. Sales may increase 13 percent to 3.1 trillion
yen.
