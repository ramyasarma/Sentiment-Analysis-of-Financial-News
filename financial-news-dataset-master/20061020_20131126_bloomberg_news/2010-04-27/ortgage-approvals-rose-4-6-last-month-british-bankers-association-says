             U.K. mortgage approvals rose in
March from the previous month as interest rates stayed at a
record low, the British Bankers’ Association said.  
 Banks granted 34,905 home loans, up 4.6 percent from
February, the group, which represents the U.K.’s largest
lenders, said in an e-mailed statement today in London.
Approvals rose 20 percent from a year earlier.  
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who’s campaigning for the May
6 election, said last week that he expects house prices to
“stabilize” as demand from first-time buyers picks up. Bank of
England policy makers kept the benchmark interest rate at 0.5
percent this month to help support the economic recovery.  
 “Low interest rates continue to influence customer
behavior,” BBA statistics director David Dooks said in the
statement.  
 The number of approvals was still lower in the first
quarter than in the final three months of 2009, a sign the
housing market has lost momentum, according to Howard Archer, an
economist at IHS Global Insight in London.  
 “The muted BBA mortgage approvals data reinforce our
suspicion that house prices will be erratic through 2010,
and may very well be no better than flat over the year,” Archer
said in an e-mailed note.
