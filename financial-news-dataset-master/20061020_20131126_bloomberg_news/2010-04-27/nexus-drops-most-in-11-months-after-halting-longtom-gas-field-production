             Nexus Energy Ltd., operator of the
Longtom gas project off southeast Australia, fell the most in 12
weeks in Sydney after halting production because of unacceptable
mercury levels found in fuel deliveries.  
 Nexus shares fell 9 percent to 29.5 Australian cents at the
close of trading, the biggest drop since Feb. 1, while the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed.  
 The oil and gas producer expects output to restart later
this week should tests show acceptable levels of mercury, the
Melbourne-based company said in a statement today to the
Australian stock exchange. Failing that, production may be
delayed while mercury-removal equipment is installed.  
 Nexus may sell as much as 50 percent of Longtom at the
right price, former managing director Ian Tchacos said in
November. AED Oil Ltd. withdrew in September from an agreement
to buy half of the venture after development delays.  
 Nexus named Richard Cottee, former managing director of
Queensland Gas Co., as chief executive officer on April 19.
Cottee is due to start May 3.  
 The company will work with Santos Ltd. to cover any supply
shortfall caused by the interruption, it said in the statement.
Santos, Australia’s third-largest oil and gas producer, agreed
to process gas from the Longtom field, which started output in
October. Installing equipment to remove mercury may cost A$2
million ($1.9 million) and take at least two months, Nexus said.
