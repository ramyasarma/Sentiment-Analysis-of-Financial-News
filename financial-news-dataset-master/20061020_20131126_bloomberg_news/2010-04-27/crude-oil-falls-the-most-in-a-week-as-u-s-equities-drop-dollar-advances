             Crude oil fell to the lowest level
in more than a week as global equities plunged and the dollar
advanced after Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services cut its
sovereign credit ratings on Greece to junk.  
 Oil plummeted 2.1 percent as credit downgrades in Greece
and Portugal, the euro region’s most indebted nations, escalated
Europe’s debt crisis. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined
the most since Feb. 4.  
 “This is a trigger that makes us reexamine our assumptions
about the prospects for economic recovery more generally and
petroleum demand in that environment more specifically,” said
Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York. “You live by the S&P, you die by the S&P.”  
 Crude oil for June delivery dropped $1.76 to $82.44 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement price since April 19. Futures have risen 64 percent
in the past year.  
 Prices declined from the settlement after the euro dropped
below $1.32 for the first time since April 2009 and the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles increased for a ninth week. Supplies gained 5.34
million barrels to 360.4 million. June oil fell $2.43, or 2.9
percent, to $81.77 a barrel in electronic trading at 4:33 p.m.  
 Greece was cut by three levels to BB+ from BBB+, the first
time a euro member has lost its investment grade since the
currency’s 1999 debut. S&P also warned that bondholders could
receive as little as 30 percent of their initial investment if
the country restructures its debt. The move came minutes after
the rating company reduced Portugal by two steps to A- from A+.  
 The S&P 500 decreased 2.3 percent to 1,183.71. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average lost 213.04 points, or 1.9 percent, to
10,991.99.  
 Dollar Advances  
 The U.S. dollar rose to $1.3184 per euro at 4:45 p.m. in
New York from $1.3383 yesterday, reducing the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities declined
1.9 percent to 273.18, the weakest level in four weeks. Fifteen
of the commodities fell, led by copper, sugar and oil.  
 Oil also retreated before a report forecast to show that
U.S. crude supplies increased last week as demand lags behind
the recovery in the world’s largest energy-consuming country.  
 U.S. crude inventories probably climbed 1.05 million
barrels, according to the median estimate of 18 analysts
surveyed before tomorrow’s Energy Department report.  
 “Anticipation of further stock builds is putting pressure
on the market today, and the equity market isn’t lending its
usual helping hand,” said Christopher Bellew, senior broker at
Bache Commodities Ltd. in London.  
 U.S. Inventories  
 The Energy Department report will probably show gasoline
inventories gained 800,000 barrels from 225 million the prior
week, the survey showed. Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, rose 1.5 million
barrels. Refinery operating rates were probably unchanged last
week after five weeks of increases.  
 The price of oil on the Nymex for June delivery was $2.56
lower than for July, a price differential that allows buyers to
profit from storing oil. It was the widest divergence between
front-month contracts since April 20, 2009.  
 “We are expecting tomorrow’s DOE report to show another
build in supplies,” said Addison Armstrong, director of market
research at Tradition Energy, a Stamford, Connecticut-based
procurement adviser. “The spread continues to widen, which
signals there is a complete lack of oil demand, at least in the
U.S.”  
 U.S. gasoline demand dropped to the lowest level in 10
weeks, according to MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse report
today. Motorists bought an average 9.21 million barrels of
gasoline a day in the week ended April 23, the lowest level
since Feb. 12.  
 Gasoline  
 Consumption fell 2.7 percent from the previous week and 1.9
percent from a year earlier, according to the second-biggest
payments network company. The average pump price for regular
gasoline was unchanged at $2.85 a gallon, the highest level
since October 2008 and 38 percent above a year earlier.  
 A “very high” U.S. unemployment rate and high gasoline
prices are restraining demand for the motor fuel, though volumes
will likely pick up when the economy recovers, Valero Energy
Corp. Chief Executive Officer Bill Klesse said today on a
conference call with analysts and investors. Valero is the
largest U.S. refiner.  
 The U.S. unemployment rate has been 9.7 percent for three
straight months through March after reaching a 26-year high of
10.1 percent in October.  
 Gasoline for May delivery fell 1.41 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $2.3268 a gallon on the Nymex.  
 Brent Spread  
 Oil prices in New York are trading at a discount of $3.34 a
barrel to London futures, the highest level since August, amid
mounting stockpiles at the U.S. Midcontinent delivery point at
Cushing, Oklahoma.  
 Brent crude for June settlement lost $1.05, or 1.2 percent,
to $85.78 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 803,026
contracts as of 3:31 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 646,918
contracts yesterday, 3.6 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.39 million contracts.
