             Hong Kong’s government will study
controlling cross-border currency movements in response to
criticism from an international task force that it failed to
seize cash related to money laundering.  
 “We are in the process of collecting data, identifying
issues and consulting stakeholders, and we will have a schedule
on consultation after analysis,” Rita Ma, spokeswoman at the
Narcotics Division of the Security Bureau, said in a phone
interview in Hong Kong today.  
 While Hong Kong has strict anti-money laundering measures,
it is easy to set up nominee and trust accounts that obscure the
ownership and control of assets, according to a June 2008 report
by the Financial Action Task Force, an inter-governmental body
that combats money laundering and terrorist financing. Hong
Kong’s government is required to submit its progress report to
the task force by the second quarter this year, Ma said.  
 The Narcotics Division plays a role in Hong Kong’s actions
against money laundering.  
 At present, Hong Kong has no restrictions on the amount of
currency travelers are permitted to carry, the South China
Morning Post reported earlier today.
