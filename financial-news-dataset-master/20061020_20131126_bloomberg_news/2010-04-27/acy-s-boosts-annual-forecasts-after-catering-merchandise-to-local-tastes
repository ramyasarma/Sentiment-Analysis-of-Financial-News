             Macy’s Inc., the second-largest
U.S. department-store chain, boosted its annual profit and sales
forecasts, helped by a strategy to better tailor merchandise to
local tastes.  
 Macy’s will earn $1.75 to $1.80 a share this year, Chief
Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said at an analyst meeting today
in New York. That compares with a $1.77 average of 17 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg and a previous maximum forecast of $1.60.
Sales at stores open at least a year will rise as much as 3.5
percent, Hoguet said. The Cincinnati-based retailer earlier
predicted a gain of 2 percent at most.  
 Macy’s plan to divide the company last year into 69
districts of about 10 stores each to satisfy local tastes is
bearing fruit, Chief Executive Officer Terry Lundgren told
analysts. Centralizing its merchandise-buying organization in
New York also has helped business, he said. The macroeconomic
outlook remains uncertain, the company said in a separate
statement today.  
 “We still are in the early stages of implementation of our
new strategies,” said Lundgren, 58. “We are optimistic about
the company’s ongoing ability to grow sales and earnings and
capture market share.”  
 Macy’s intends to use its cash to pay down debt and regain
an investment-grade rating, Hoguet said. The company has a Ba2
rating from Moody’s Investors Service and a BB from Standard &
Poor’s, both two levels below investment grade.  
 The retailer has more deals in the works to sell “powerful
brands” exclusively, Lundgren said.  
 Macy’s fell 94 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $23.91 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have climbed 43 percent this year.
