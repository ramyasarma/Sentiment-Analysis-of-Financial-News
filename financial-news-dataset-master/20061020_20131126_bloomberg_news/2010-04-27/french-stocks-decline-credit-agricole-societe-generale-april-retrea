             France’s CAC 40 Index declined
152.79, or 3.8 percent, to 3,844.60 in Paris for the biggest
decrease in a year. The SBF 120 Index dropped 3.5 percent.  
 The indexes slid after Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
lowered its long- and short-term sovereign credit ratings on
Greece to ‘BB+’ and ‘B’, respectively, from ‘BBB+’ and ‘A-2’.  
 Stocks also fell, led by banks, amid concern Greece will
ask investors to accept delayed or reduced payments on its debt
and that its deficit crisis may spread.  
 The country is likely to default or inflict “significant”
losses on bondholders unless it receives more generous terms on
its planned aid package, according to Willem Buiter, chief
economist at Citigroup Inc.  
 Credit Agricole SA, France’s biggest bank by branches, lost
6.4 percent to 11.44 euros.  
 BNP Paribas SA, France’s largest bank by assets, plunged 7
percent to 50.73 euros. Societe Generale SA, the country’s
second-biggest bank, declined 6 percent to 41.05 euros.  
 The following shares rose or fell in Paris. Stock symbols
are in parentheses.  
 April Group (APR FP) sank 6.6 percent to 24.90 euros,
declining the most since September. The Lyon-based insurance
broker said first-quarter revenue fell 9.6 percent to 184
million euros.  
 ArcelorMittal (MT NA), the world’s biggest steelmaker,
retreated 3.8 percent to 31.22 euros as metals prices fell in
London.  
 Cie. Generale de Geophysique-Veritas (GA FP), the world’s
largest seismic surveyor, lost 4.7 percent to 23.80 euros, the
biggest drop in nearly 12 weeks. The stock was cut to “reduce”
from “add” at AlphaValue.  
 Lagardere SCA (MMB FP) dropped 6.1 percent to 29.72 euros,
the biggest decline in nearly seven weeks. The biggest French
publisher announced at its AGM that activist investor Guy Wyser-
Pratte didn’t win election to the board after receiving 22
percent support.
