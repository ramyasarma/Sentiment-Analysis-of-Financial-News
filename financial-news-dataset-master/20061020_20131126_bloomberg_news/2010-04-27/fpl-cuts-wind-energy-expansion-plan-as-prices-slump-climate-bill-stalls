             FPL Group Inc., the largest U.S.
producer of renewable energy, cut plans to expand wind-energy
projects for by as much as 40 percent, due to low electricity
prices and uncertainty regarding climate legislation.  
 The company, based in Juno Beach, Florida, plans to build
600 megawatts to 850 megawatts of wind-energy plants this year,
versus the previously planned 1,000 megawatts, according to a
statement today.  
 More than 10,000 megawatts of new wind-power capacity were
installed in the U.S. in 2009, enough for about 2.4 million
homes and a record for the industry, according to the
Washington-based American Wind Energy Association. Wind power
provided 1.8 percent of U.S. electricity last year.  
 Legislation to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and
encourage energy sources like wind and solar power was approved
by the U.S. House in June. The Senate has yet to vote on the
measure, and Republican Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina
said on April 24 he was dropping out of bipartisan talks after
Democrats said they would take up immigration legislation.  
 Emissions limits that were expected to be in place
beginning in 2012 under last year’s legislation are now unlikely
before 2020, Mike Morris, chief executive officer of American
Electric Power Co., the biggest U.S. producer of electricity
from coal, said last month.  
 FPL said today that 1,360 megawatts of new wind projects
during the last 12 months added 3 cents a share to first-quarter
adjusted earnings. The company said first-quarter net income
increased to $556 million, or $1.36 per share, from $364
million, or 90 cents, in the year-earlier period.  
 FPL fell $1.04, or 2 percent, to $50.02 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
