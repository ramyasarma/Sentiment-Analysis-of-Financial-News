             Neiman Marcus Group, the U.S.
luxury retailer owned by Warburg Pincus LLC and TPG Inc., said
Chief Executive Officer Burton M. Tansky will retire this year,
remaining chairman.  
 Karen W. Katz, an executive vice president who joined
Neiman Marcus in 1985, will replace Tansky as CEO and president
on Oct. 6, the Dallas-based company said in a statement
yesterday. Tansky will remain chairman, while Chief Financial
Officer James Skinner adds the title of chief operating officer.  
 Tansky, 72, has been chief executive since 2001. He joined
the company in 1989 and was part of the 2005 deal in which
private equity firms Warburg Pincus and TPG bought the retailer
for $5.1 billion.  
 Last month, the company reported second-quarter profit of
$3.96 million on sales of $1.1 billion. Luxury sales increased
22.7 percent in March, a sign consumers have picked up spending
after the recession, according to MasterCard Advisors’
SpendingPulse.
