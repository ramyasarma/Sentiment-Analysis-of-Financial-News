             Hong Kong’s cage homes, created by 
subdividing old apartments into separate living compartments, 
have become more expensive on a square foot basis than luxury 
units in the city’s Peak district, the South China Morning Post
reported today.  
 Tenants of the cage homes pay up to HK$100 per square foot,
up to 25 percent higher, on a square foot basis, than the cost 
of renting an apartment on The Peak, according to the 
newspaper.
