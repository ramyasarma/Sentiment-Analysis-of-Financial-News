             Hong Kong stocks fell, led by
developers and banks, as concern deepened that China’s efforts
to cool its property market will damp economic growth and
suppress demand for raw materials.  
 Hang Lung Properties Ltd., a developer that generated 40
percent of its fiscal 2009 revenue in China, declined 2.7
percent. China Resources Land Ltd., a state-controlled developer,
slid 2.8 percent. China Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s
second-largest lender, dropped 1.6 percent. Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd., the nation’s largest producer of the metal,
retreated 3.2 percent.  
 The Hang Seng Index dropped 1.5 percent to 21,261.79, its
biggest loss since April 19. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index, which tracks the so-called H shares of Hong Kong-listed
Chinese companies, decreased 1.7 percent to 12,171.01.  
 “The market is worried that China is over-tightening,”
said Grace Tam, Hong Kong-based vice president of investment
services at JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd., which manages about
$102 billion in Asia-Pacific assets. “The concern is that this
could result in a worse-than-expected impact on China’s
growth.”
