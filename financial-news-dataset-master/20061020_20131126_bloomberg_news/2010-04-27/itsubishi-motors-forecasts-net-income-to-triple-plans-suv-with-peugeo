             Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said net
income will triple to 15 billion yen ($160 million) this fiscal
year as it expects to sell more vehicles and reduce costs.  
 The carmaker will produce a compact sport-utility vehicle
with France’s PSA Peugeot Citroen from early 2012 in Europe, the
Tokyo-based company said in a statement today. The automakers
expect to produce 50,000 SUVs a year, according to the statement.  
 Mitsubishi estimated it will raise global vehicle sales 17
percent this year after higher unemployment cut demand in Japan,
U.S. and Europe. The Japanese carmaker and Peugeot last month
decided against forming a capital alliance, deciding instead to
work together on electric cars, four-wheel-drive vehicles and a
planned Russian factory.  
 “Mitsubishi will continue to cut costs to gain profit step
by step,” said Satoru Takada, a Tokyo-based senior analyst at
Toward the Infinite World Inc.  
 Mitsubishi Motors fell 0.8 percent to close at 131 yen in
Tokyo trading.  
 Mitsubishi Motors said global vehicle sales will rise 17
percent to 1.12 million this fiscal year, with gains of 12
percent in Japan, 16 percent in Europe and 24 percent in North
America. The maker of the i-MiEV electric car and Pajero sport-
utility vehicle estimated operating profit will more than triple
to 45 billion yen in the year ending March 31.
