             The recent economic meltdown might
be traced, in part, to a section of the brain humans share with
lizards.  
 So says “ Mind Over Money ,” a PBS special airing tonight
at 8 p.m. New York time. While most shows about economics have
all the excitement of a morphine drip, this one is captivating.  
 According to the show, the lizard part of our brain
triggers “some of the deepest and most primal human needs,”
including the acquisition of food, sex and -- yes -- money.  
 Brian Knutson , a professor at Stanford University, explains
that money “activates these circuits and does so very
powerfully,” which could explain frenzied economic activity
such as speculative bubbles. So, perhaps our inner reptile is to
blame for our current economic woes.  
 The show pits rationalists who believe humans almost always
act in their own best interest against behaviorists, who believe
emotions can profoundly affect economic behavior, often in a
negative way.  
 The rationalist viewpoint is championed at the University
of Chicago, which has produced a record number of Nobel Prize
winners in economics. The show includes interviews with Chicago
professors John Cochrane and  Gary Becker , who argue that people
almost always operate in their own self-interest. This,
rationalists say, keeps markets stable and efficient, thus
avoiding the need for regulation.  
 Money Madness  
 Behaviorists such as Yale professor  Robert Shiller  aren’t
buying it. (During the housing boom, Shiller warned it was an
“irrational mania.”) They believe the destabilizing effects of
emotion must be offset by regulation. In other words, let’s put
the lizard on a leash.  
 The show includes several experiments that suggest the
behaviorists may be onto something. In one, participants are
asked to bid on a $20 bill. It ends up going for $28.  
 Why would the bidders engage in behavior clearly contrary
to their own self-interest? Apparently the frenzied desire to
win drives up the price.  
 “People have played this game for quite high stakes” says
University of Chicago professor  Richard Thaler .  
 Sad Movie  
 Another experiment found that people who had just seen a
sad movie were willing to pay four times more for a water bottle
than a group that hadn’t seen the film. Jennifer Lerner, a
Harvard social psychologist, says the sad people didn’t realize
the movie had affected them, indicating economic behavior may be
driven by factors we are unaware of.  
 Becker and Cochrane counter that people act differently in
labs than in the real world. Yet the real world offers stunning
examples of emotions taking over.  
 Consider the tulip panic of the 1630s, when the value of a
single bulb could match that of a house. Almost half the money
in the Dutch economy may have been tied up in the tulip trade.
In February 1637 the tulip market collapsed, triggering a
nationwide panic and economic crash that took decades to recover
from.  
 So much for rational behavior.
