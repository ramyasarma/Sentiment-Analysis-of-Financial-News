             Electrolux AB, the world’s second-
biggest appliance maker, reported first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates, driven by a better-than-expected recovery
in U.S. markets.  
 Net income was 911 million kronor ($127 million), or 3.2
kronor a share, compared with a loss of 346 million kronor, or
1.22 kronor, a year earlier, the Stockholm-based company said
today. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey predicted 658 million
kronor. Sales fell 2.7 percent to 25.1 billion kronor, in line
with estimates.  
 Electrolux said new products and demand for Frigidaire and
own-brand appliances in the U.S. bolstered earnings, while
improved profitability helped offset higher raw-material costs.
Chief Executive Hans Straaberg has moved much of the company’s
production to lower-cost countries as part of a seven-year
overhaul scheduled to be completed this year.  
 “Demand in our most important markets has recovered
somewhat more quickly than we anticipated,” Straaberg said in
the statement. “This is primarily true of the U.S. market,
which showed strong growth in March. For the whole of Western
Europe, we note a certain increased demand for the first time
after 10 quarters of decreases.”  
 Yesterday, Electrolux’s bigger rival Whirlpool Corp. said
that first-quarter profit more than doubled to $164 million from
$68 million. The world’s largest appliance maker also increased
its forecast, sending its shares to the highest level in almost
three years.
