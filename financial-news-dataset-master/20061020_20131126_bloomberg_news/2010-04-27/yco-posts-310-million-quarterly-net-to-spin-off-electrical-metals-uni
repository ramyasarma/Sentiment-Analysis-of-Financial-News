             Tyco International Ltd., the
world’s largest maker of security systems, said it will spin off
an electrical and metals business and reported second-quarter
net income of $310 million after a year-earlier loss.  
 The planned transaction is part of Chief Executive Officer
Edward Breen’s plan to focus on security, fire systems and flow
control, a spokesman said today. Breen announced the acquisition
of Brink’s Home Security Holdings Inc. for about $2 billion in
January and said Tyco plans to make “a couple” of smaller
purchases as the U.S. pulls out of recession.  
 “The spin-off will allow Electrical & Metal Products to
pursue its own strategy as a highly-focused company apart from
Tyco, while enabling Tyco to sharpen its focus on our three core
platforms,” said Paul Fitzhenry, a spokesman for Schaffhausen,
Switzerland-based Tyco.  
 The spinoff will be structured as a tax-free distribution
to shareholders, the company said. The unit, which had revenue
of $1.4 billion in 2009, designs and makes galvanized steel
tubes, electrical conduit and metal framing systems.  
 “We view this announcement as a positive because it should
not only help reduce Tyco’s earnings volatility but also help
improve overall valuation,” Ajay Kejriwal, an analyst at FBR
Capital Markets in New York, said in a note today.  
 The unit is based in Harvey, Illinois, and employs 3,200
people worldwide, spokesman Fitzhenry said.  
 Earnings Results  
 Tyco raised its full-year forecast to as much as $2.58 a
share, less than analysts’ average estimate of $2.59. The stock
fell 40 cents, or 1 percent, to $40 at 9:37 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 Net income of 65 cents a share compared with a loss of
$2.57 billion, or $5.42, a year earlier, Tyco said today in a
statement. Profit from continuing operations excluding some
costs in the quarter ended March 26 was 59 cents a share,
beating the 54-cent average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Sales rose less than 1 percent to $4.17 billion in the
latest quarter, compared with an average estimate of $4.16
billion in a survey of nine analysts. The year-earlier net loss
was caused mostly by a $2.64 billion charge from goodwill and
asset impairments.  
 Full-year profit will be $2.50 to $2.58 a share, compared
with a previous forecast of $2.30 to $2.50 a share, Tyco said
today on a conference call. The average estimate was $2.59 in a
Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts. Third-quarter profit will be 60
cents to 62 cents a share, the company said.  
 The company last year reduced costs, including shrinking
its workforce by 5,000, to make up for slack demand. The U.S.
economy expanded at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the fourth
quarter, the biggest gain in six years. For all of 2009, the
economy shrank 2.4 percent.  
 On April 12, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services increased
the company’s debt rating one level to A-, or six levels below
its highest rating, from BBB+, saying the Brinks acquisition
shouldn’t add “meaningful additional debt.”
