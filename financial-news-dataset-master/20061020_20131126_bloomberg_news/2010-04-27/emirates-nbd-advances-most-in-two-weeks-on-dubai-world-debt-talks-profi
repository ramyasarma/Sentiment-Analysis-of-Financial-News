             Emirates NBD PJSC rose the most in
more than two weeks after the United Arab Emirates’ largest bank
by assets said Dubai World’s talks to restructure debt are
making progress.  
 The shares advanced 3.4 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since April 12, to 3.05 dirhams as of 12:18 p.m. in Dubai.  
 The bank expects a resolution to Dubai World’s debt
restructuring in a “few weeks,” Chief Executive Officer Rick
Pudner said yesterday. Emirates NBD is one the biggest lenders
to state-owned Dubai World, which is trying to renegotiate $24.8
billion of debt.  
 Separately, the bank’s non-performing loan ratio “will
peak somewhere around the 3 percent range” by the middle of
this year or in the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer
Sanjay Uppal said yesterday.
