             Gold rose in New York, heading for
a third straight gain, on renewed demand for the metal as an
alternative to the euro amid concern that European governments
may fail to contain Greece’s deficit crisis.  
 Gold futures for June delivery rose $5.10, or 0.4 percent,
to $1,159.10 an ounce at 10:47 a.m. on the Comex, erasing an
earlier decline of as much as 0.6 percent. The metal rebounded
on demand for an alternative to currencies, as the euro slipped
for the eighth time in nine sessions against the dollar.
