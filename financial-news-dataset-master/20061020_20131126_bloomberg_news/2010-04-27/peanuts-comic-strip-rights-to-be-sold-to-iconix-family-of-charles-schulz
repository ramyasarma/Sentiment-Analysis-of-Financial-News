             The rights to Charlie Brown and
Snoopy will be bought by Iconix Brand Group Inc. and the family
of cartoonist Charles Schulz, adding to the company’s earnings
this year and shifting more of its revenue away from fashion.  
 Iconix and the Schulz family will pay $175 million for the
Peanuts comic-strip characters and other assets, with the New
York-based company acquiring 80 percent from United Features
Syndicate Inc. and E.W. Scripps Co. The deal includes character
brands Dilbert and Fancy Nancy, said Iconix, which owns and
markets consumer brands.  
 The acquisition is part of a strategy to add more revenue
outside of the company’s fashion labels, which include Candie’s
and London Fog. Peanuts, with its cast of Charlie Brown, Snoopy,
Lucy and the gang, is licensed in more than 40 countries and
generates annual retail sales of more than $2 billion.  
 “This acquisition represents a healthy departure, in our
view, from the traditional fashion brands that Iconix has
previously purchased,” Todd Slater, an analyst at Lazard
Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a note. He recommends
buying Iconix shares.  
 Iconix has a market value of about $1.3 billion. Stock of
the New York-based company rose 37 cents, or 2 percent, to
$18.76 at 3:09 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  
 Big Retailer Deal?  
 Fashion will account for about two-thirds of revenue after
the acquisition, compared with about 90 percent now, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Neil Cole said in a telephone
interview.  
 Iconix may do “a big deal with one of the big retailers”
over the Peanuts license, Cole said. Other opportunities may be
found in video games and emerging markets such as India, he
said.  
 About two-thirds of Peanuts sales come from outside the
U.S., Iconix said.  
 Iconix halted talks to buy Playboy Enterprises Inc. in
December, according to two people familiar with the discussions.  
 The purchase should add 12 cents to 15 cents a share to
annual earnings, said Lazard Capital’s Slater.  
 The company raised its 2010 earnings forecast to as much as
$1.40 from at most $1.30, and said sales will total as much as
$315 million, up from the $270 million it predicted previously.  
 Analysts estimated profit of $1.29 and sales of $266.3
million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The company said first-quarter net income rose 58 percent
to $24.8 million, or 33 cents a share. Revenue climbed 42
percent to $71.7 million.  
 Peanuts’ “licensing model is quite flexible and lends
itself to creative opportunities,” Slater said in a telephone
interview.  
 CVS, Benetton  
 There are more than 1,200 licensing agreements for the
Peanuts brand with companies including Universal Studios, CVS
Caremark Corp., Walgreen Co., Hennes & Mauritz AB and Benetton
Group SpA, Iconix said in a statement.  
 The comic strip, created by the late Charles Schulz,
celebrates its 60th anniversary this year. Charlie Brown and
Snoopy were introduced in October 1950. Linus, Lucy and the rest
of the Peanuts gallery appeared in subsequent years.  
 Following Schulz’s wishes, no new Peanuts strips will be
drawn, according to the Web site of the Charles M. Schulz Museum
in Santa Rosa, California.  
 The family, which hasn’t previously owned the brand, will
work closely with Iconix, Cole said.  
 “We’re going to be partners and they’re going to be very
involved,” he said.  
 The transaction will close in the next 30 to 60 days,
Iconix said.
