             Portugal will follow Greece in
having its debt downgraded to junk, according to Ignis Asset
Management.  
 Greek two-year government note yields surged to more than
17 percent today after Standard & Poor’s cut the nation’s credit
rating three levels to BB+. Portuguese two-year note yields
jumped 122 basis points to 5.41 percent as of 4:43 p.m. in
London.  
 “This speeds up the haircut for Greece and it’s never just
one follicle,” Stuart Thomson, chief market economist at Ignis
in Glasgow, said in a telephone interview today. “Portugal will
follow.”
