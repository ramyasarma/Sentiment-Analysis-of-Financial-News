             Copper and aluminum declined on
concern that an aid package for Greece won’t stop its deficit
crisis from spreading, boosting the dollar. Lead, nickel and
zinc also dropped.  
 Three-month delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
dropped as much as 1.4 percent to $7,699 a metric ton, and
traded at $7,725 at 2:37 p.m. in Shanghai. Aluminum lost as much
as 0.5 percent to $2,305 a ton.  
 There will be no decision on aid for Greece until the
International Monetary Fund works out a plan of cuts with the
government in Athens, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
yesterday, boosting the U.S. currency. The dollar also rebounded
on speculation that the Federal Reserve is moving closer to
withdrawing stimulus as the U.S. economy recovers.  
 “The uncertainties in the Greek situation may prompt
investors to continue seeking refuge in safe-haven assets such
as the dollar,” Yan Wei, an analyst at Huazheng Futures Co.,
said from Shanghai. A stronger dollar can reduce demand for
commodities denominated in the U.S. currency.  
 Speculation that the Fed may change its tone regarding
record-low interest rates was boosting prospects for a stronger
dollar, Yan said. A two-day meeting of the policy-setting
Federal Open Market Committee starts tomorrow.  
 Copper for July delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell as much as 1.8 percent to 60,350 yuan ($8,840) a ton, the
lowest level since April 21. Aluminum fell as much as 1.2
percent to 16,410 yuan a ton, the lowest price since March 26,
and zinc tumbled as much as 2 percent to 18,880 yuan, the lowest
level since April 20.  
 Property Measures  
 China may use capital requirements for developers to cool
the property market, Ba Shusong, deputy directory general of the
State Council’s Development Research Center, told the Shanghai
Securities News. The country should also consider using a
property tax to curb speculation, Ba said. China is the world’s
biggest user of metals including copper, aluminum and zinc.  
 “As aluminum is weak in London, Chinese investors may step
up selling as Shanghai prices go below the 16,500-yuan level,”
said Chen Jian, an analyst at Minmetals Haiqin Futures Co.  
 Lead slumped 1.7 percent to $2,319 a ton, zinc dropped 1.7
percent to $2,400 ton and nickel declined 1.7 percent at $26,700
a ton. Tin dropped 0.8 percent to $19,000 a ton at 2:28 p.m. in
Shanghai.
