             China Vanke Co. fell to its lowest
in more than a year in Shenzhen trading after first-quarter
profit was nearly halved from the previous three months as the
government announced measures to cool the property market.  
 The stock of the country’s biggest property developer by
market value dropped 1.5 percent to 7.68 yuan at 10:03 a.m.
local time, the lowest since March 3, 2009. It earlier fell as
much as 2.6 percent.  
 The Shenzhen-based developer yesterday said first-quarter
profit reached 1.13 billion yuan ($165.5 million), which is 53
percent lower from the three months ended Dec. 31. Concerns that
government measures to cool the property market would hurt home
demand have dragged Vanke’s shares 29 percent lower this year.  
 China has ordered higher mortgage rates and down-payment
ratios since property prices jumped 11.7 percent in March, the
most since data began in 2005. To cool the market, China on
April 20 ordered developers not to take deposits for sales of
uncompleted flats without proper approval. This adds to curbs on
loans for third-home purchase and the reinstatement of a sales
tax on homes.  
 The government’s measures “will have significant impact on
the market,” Vanke said in a statement yesterday. “It is
believed that the trend of rapid rise in housing prices in the
popular cities will end and the spillover of euphoria to other
cities will stop.”  
 Still, the drop in Vanke’s shares has made them cheap, Liu
Kun, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Great Wall Securities Co., said
by phone today.  
 Vanke is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 15.11,
compared with 18.84 for the China SE Shang Property Index. The
measure, which tracks 34 developers on the Shanghai Composite
Index, fell 0.4 percent today.
