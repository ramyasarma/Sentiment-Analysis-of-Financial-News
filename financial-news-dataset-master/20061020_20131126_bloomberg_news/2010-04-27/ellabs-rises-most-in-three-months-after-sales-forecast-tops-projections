             Tellabs Inc., the U.S. maker of
telecommunications equipment, climbed the most in three months
after its second-quarter revenue forecast exceeded analysts’
projections.  
 Revenue will climb at least 10 percent from the previous
quarter, Tellabs said today in a statement. That amounts to
about $418 million, beating the $386.5 million average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Tellabs is tapping demand from carriers that are investing
in improving their wireless networks to accommodate the growing
popularity of data-hungry smartphones.  
 The company, based in Naperville, Illinois, said first-
quarter revenue climbed 5 percent to $380 million from a year
earlier. Tellabs reported earnings per share excluding some
charges of 11 cents, beating the average estimate of cents from
a Bloomberg survey.  
 The stock rose 11 percent in Nasdaq Stock Market trading to
$9.09 at 10:19 a.m. New York time. The shares, which had gained
45 percent this year before today, are trading at their highest
level since October 2007. Today’s gain is the most since Tellabs
rose 12 percent on Jan. 26.
