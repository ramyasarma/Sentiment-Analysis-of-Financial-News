             An environmental report for Chevron
Corp.’s plan to upgrade an oil refinery near San Francisco
failed to adequately specify whether heavier and more polluting
crude oil could be processed or disclose measures for mitigating
increases in greenhouse gas emissions, a California court ruled.  
 A state appeals court in San Francisco yesterday found that
elements of the report violated requirements of California’s
environmental quality law. The Richmond City Council relied on
the report when it voted 5-4 in 2008 to issue permits for the
Chevron project in that city, according to the ruling.  
 The project, which would replace equipment including a
40-year-old hydrogen unit, was halted after a state court judge
ruled that an environmental permit was inadequate. Groups
including Earthjustice and Communities for a Better Environment
alleged in a lawsuit that the project would increase pollution.  
 Chevron is reviewing the ruling, said spokesman Brent
Tippen, in an e-mailed statement.  
 “We feel both the evidence and the law amply supported the
adequacy of the environmental impact report prepared by the city
of Richmond for the renewal project,” Tippen said in the
statement. “Chevron believes that the renewal project was
properly analyzed and permitted.”  
 Chevron and environmental groups halted talks on reviving
the project, Chevron said in July.  
 The case is Communities for a Better Environment v. City of
Richmond, A125618, Court of Appeal (San Francisco).
