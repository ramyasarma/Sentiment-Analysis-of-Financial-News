             Investors may have added to bets on
a decline in Greek government bonds last week as the nation
conceded it will need aid to manage debt payments, information
from Data Explorers shows.  
 Demand to borrow Greek debt increased to 15 percent of the
amount of securities available for so-called short positions as
of April 23, from 11 percent a week before, the London and New
York-based research company said today. At the same time,
institutional investors reduced their holdings of the bonds,
according to the company, which bases its analysis on data
provided by holders of $2 trillion of government debt.  
 “The data show there’s a degree of pessimism on Greece
over the short term,” said Will Duff Gordon, director of
investment management strategy at Data Explorers in London.  
 Greece said last week it wants to activate a European
Union-led 45 billion-euro ($60 billion) rescue plan. Yields on
the nation’s debt securities surged to the highest since at
least 1998 this week amid concern it may seek to delay or reduce
its debt payments.  
 Greece’s Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou told
reporters in Washington two days ago they will “lose their
shirts” if they bet the nation will default.
