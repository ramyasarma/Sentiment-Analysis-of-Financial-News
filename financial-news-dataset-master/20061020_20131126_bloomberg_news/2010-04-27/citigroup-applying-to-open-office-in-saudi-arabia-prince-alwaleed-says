             Citigroup Inc., the New York-based
bank that sold its 20 percent stake in a Saudi Arabian lender
six years ago, is applying to open an office in the kingdom,
shareholder Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal said.  
 “Saudi Arabia welcomes the presence of a Citibank office
here,” the Saudi billionaire, who owned 218 million shares in
the bank as of November 2008, said today in an interview with
Bloomberg Television.  
 The bank sold its 20 percent stake in the Saudi American
Bank, now known as Samba Financial Group, to the state Public
Investment Fund for $760 million in 2004, ending a business that
started in 1955.  
 In the 1970s, the Saudi government forced foreign banks
such as Citigroup, HSBC Holdings Plc and ABN Amro Holdings NV to
sell majority stakes in their local operations to Saudi
nationals. A 2003 capital-market law opened the door for foreign
banks to apply for licenses.  
 Citigroup spokesman Karim Seifeddine declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News.
