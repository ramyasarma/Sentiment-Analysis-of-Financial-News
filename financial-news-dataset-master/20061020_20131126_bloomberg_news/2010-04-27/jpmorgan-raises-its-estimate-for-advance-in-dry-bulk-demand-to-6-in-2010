             Global demand for dry bulk
commodities will expand 6 percent this year, compared with a
previous forecast of 3.7 percent, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  
 The bank now expects iron-ore trade growth of 11.2 percent,
from an earlier estimate of 5.7 percent, and coal demand
expansion of 5.7 percent, from 3.8 percent, analysts Jonathan
Chappell and Darren Hicks in New York wrote in a note today.  
 The increased trade will coincide with half the ships that
are scheduled to be built this year being delayed or cancelled,
as yards in Asia fail to deliver a record order book on time,
they said.  
 “We do not believe that it is even physically possible for
the shipyards to meet this robust schedule, with or without
financing concerns,” they added.  
 JPMorgan increased its forecasts for what ships will earn
as a result by as much as 33 percent.  
 So-called panamax ships, the largest to sail through the
Panama Canal, will average $21,200 a day this year, up from a
previous forecast of $16,000, JPMorgan said. Rates for
capesizes, most commonly used to haul iron ore, were revised up
3.1 percent to $33,000 a day; supramaxes were increased 22
percent to $17,100 a day, and handymaxes will make $14,700,
compared with a prior estimate of $12,000, it said.
