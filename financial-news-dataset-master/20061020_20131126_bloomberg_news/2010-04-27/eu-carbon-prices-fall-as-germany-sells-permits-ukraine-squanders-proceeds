             European Union carbon permits fell
from their highest price in more than seven months as Germany
auctioned allowances and Ukraine said it squandered proceeds
intended for climate spending.  
 EU carbon allowances for December fell as much as 1.7
percent to 15.33 euros a metric ton on London’s European Climate
Exchange and traded at 15.46 euros at noon local time. They rose
earlier today as much as 1.2 percent to 15.78 euros, the highest
intraday price since Sept. 8, on speculation that EU utilities
may be short of permits after 2012. The contract is up 24
percent this year.  
 Germany sold 300,000 carbon-dioxide permits for spot
delivery at 15.303 euros apiece in an auction today, the
European Energy Exchange said on its Web site. The previous
auction a week ago fetched 14.59 euros. Germany, the EU’s
biggest emitter, plans weekly sales of 300,000 spot carbon
allowances through October this year and next. The country also
will auction 870,000 spot permits weekly starting in November,
according to the EEX.  
 In the Ukraine, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said the
country misued money from sales of United Nations emission
allowances to Japan. “Green investments from Japan were
wasted,” Azarov told reporters today in Kiev. “We will have to
return 3.5 billion hryvnia ($442 million).”  
 The eastern European nation sold 30 million metric tons of
UN Assigned Amount Units to Japan last year for 10.40 euros
($13.87) each, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Countries that buy AAUs to meet targets under the Kyoto Protocol
often place conditions on how the proceeds must be spent.  
 AAU Sales  
 While AAUs can’t be used for compliance in the EU market,
each EU allowance has an AAU stapled to it, allowing trade among
factories and power stations in the bloc.  
 The EU started a carbon market in 2005 to help meet Kyoto
limits. The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, will
probably show in a June report that the 27 nations can afford to
adopt a stricter emission-reduction goal, Climate Commissioner
Connie Hedegaard said yesterday.  
 The EU aims to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 20
percent this decade from 1990 levels and has said it will
tighten that to 30 percent depending on similar commitments from
developed nations outside Europe. The European Commission is
working on an analysis of such a move and will present it before
the next meeting of EU leaders on June 17-18.  
 “The preliminary results suggest that going to 30 percent
would be technically feasible and economically affordable,”
Hedegaard told a committee hearing in the European Parliament in
Brussels. “It may be not as expensive to go to 30 percent with
the knowledge we have today and after the crisis as it would
have looked some years back.”
