             (Corrects “Shrek” film title in seventh paragraph,
“Megamind” release date in 12th.)  
 DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. said
first-quarter profit fell 65 percent after the 3-D feature “How
to Train Your Dragon” came up short against year-earlier
results that were bolstered by DVD sales of “Madagascar 2.”  
 Net income slid to $21.7 million, or 24 cents a share, from
$62.3 million, or 71 cents, a year earlier, Glendale,
California-based DreamWorks Animation said today in a statement.
Sales fell 38 percent to $162.1 million, beating the $133.8
million average of 15 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 A sequel to “Dragon,” which contributed $59.7 million in
the quarter, is planned for 2013, Chief Executive Officer
Jeffrey Katzenberg said today on a conference call. “Dragon”
opened to lower than expected box-office sales and profits won’t
be recognized until the DVD release, Katzenberg said.  
 “It’s not where you start, it’s where you finish that
counts,” Katzenberg said on the conference call. “It opened
below ours’ and others’ expectations, and it certainly had us
nervous after the first week, but just this past weekend it was
the No. 1 film in the country.”  
 DreamWorks Animation fell 63 cents to $42.36 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained
6 percent this year.  
 “Dragon” will deliver $118 million in profit to
DreamWorks Animation, according to Barton Crockett, an analyst
at Lazard Capital Markets in New York, who lowered his estimate
by 16 percent in a report yesterday.  
 ‘Shrek Forever After’  
 Second-quarter results will hinge on the May 21 theatrical
release of “Shrek Forever After,” President Lewis Coleman said
on the call.  
 Results for the quarter just ended included an $8.2 million
expense, with $2.1 million, or about 2 cents, related to prior
year taxes. Analysts projected profit of 25 cents a share, the
average of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “Dragon,” the biggest contributor in the period, couldn’t
match the $147.5 million in DVD sales from “Madagascar: Escape
2 Africa” that were recognized a year ago.  
 “For those reasons, it is difficult to compare this
quarter’s results to the period a year before,” Coleman said.  
 DreamWorks Animation purchased about 1 million of its
shares for $37 million, Coleman said. The company can still buy
back another $113 million of its shares, he said.  
 After “Shrek,” DreamWorks will release “Megamind” on
Nov. 5, making the studio the first to put out three computer-
animated films in a year, Katzenberg said.  
 3-D Theaters  
 Domestic theater owners are adding 250 new 3-D screens a
week, with cinema operators outside the U.S. adding an equal
amount, Katzenberg said. Viacom Inc.’s Paramount, which
distributes DreamWorks Animation titles, told the company
“Shrek” will be on at least 4,000 U.S. 3-D screens, he said.  
 Paramount has done an “outstanding job” of releasing
DreamWorks Animation titles over the past four and a half years,
Katzenberg said. He declined to comment on whether the company
will renew the agreement, which ends in 2012 or sooner.  
 “We have a lot of confidence in them domestically and
internationally,” Katzenberg said. “I do want to give a high
vote of confidence to them.”
