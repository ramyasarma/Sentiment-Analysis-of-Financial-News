             Iran, OPEC’s second-biggest oil
producer, added three supertankers to its fleet of vessels
storing crude, matching a similar program in 2008 that helped
freight rates to triple, ship tracking data show.  
 At least 15 such vessels are idling in the Persian Gulf,
Gulf of Oman and Gulf of Suez, according to data from the ships
collected by AISLive Ltd. The tankers can store a combined 30
million barrels of oil, more than a week of national output.  
 Two years ago, Iran used as many as 15 tankers for storage,
constricting vessel supply and helping to more than triple
freight rates in less than three months.  
 Iran is likely storing oil because of weakening demand as
refineries across Asia, accounting for almost two-thirds of
global demand for supertankers, carry out maintenance. National
Iranian Tanker Co., which operates the supertankers, also has a
laden suezmax tanker idling off Iran, ship-tracking data show. A
suezmax can hold about 1 million barrels of oil.  
 “They don’t want to shut down their production,” said
Ole-Rikard Hammer, an analyst at Pareto Securities ASA in Oslo
who’s tracked tanker markets for more than two decades. “The
refining clients are buying less because of maintenance and the
Iranians seem to prefer to keep oil in floating storage.”  
 The discount on Iran Heavy crude compared with Oman and
Dubai petroleum is at its widest in more than a year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discounts on Iran’s Forozan,
Soroosh and Norooz crudes have also widened.  
 Widening Discounts  
 Calls made after normal business hours to Ahmad Qalebani,
managing director of National Iranian Oil Co., and to Mohammad
Souri, managing director of National Iranian Tanker Co., weren’t
answered. Ali Asghar Arshi, NIOC’s manager of international
affairs, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  
 National Iranian Tanker has a fleet of 28 supertankers,
according to Lloyd’s Register-Fairplay data on Bloomberg. The
remaining 13 carriers are all either moving or have been at
their present locations for less than two weeks, according to
the tracking data.  
 The extra vessels now storing are the Davar, Daylam and
Hatef, according to the data. The Harsin has been added into the
total again. It entered the Gulf of Suez in early March,
circling for about a month before moving north. It then circled
for two more weeks before moving south again. It was discounted
from the last tally because it was moving at the time. It is now
circling again in about the same position as in early March.  
 Charter rates for supertankers sailing to Japan from Saudi
Arabia, the route that’s used to settle freight derivatives,
fell 3.2 percent to 92.22 Worldscale points today, according to
the London-based Baltic Exchange. Returns from the voyage lost
6.8 percent to $51,331 a day.  
 Suezmax rental income advanced 3.6 percent to $47,223 a
day, according to the exchange. Aframaxes that transport
650,000-barrel cargoes slipped 11 percent to $8,537 a day.
