             Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP,
the San Francisco law firm with more than 1,100 lawyers
worldwide, hired Maurice Hoo from Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &
Walker LLP in Hong Kong to co-head its global private equity
practice.  
 “More private equity funds will be doing deals on the Hong
Kong public market,” Hoo, 44, said in an interview. Peter
O’Driscoll in London is Orrick’s other head of the practice.  
 New York-based Shearman & Sterling LLP and Weil Gotshal &
Manges LLP have expanded in Hong Kong to target private equity
work involving Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies. Emerging
markets may double their share of global private equity
commitments to 15 percent in the next two years, according to a
report by the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association and
Coller Capital.  
 Deals last year included Bain Capital LLC’s purchase of
$233 million in convertible bonds of Gome Electrical Appliance
Holdings Ltd. and TPG Capital buying $81 million in convertible
bonds of Daphne International Holdings Ltd., owner of the Daphne
and Shoebox brands in China.  
 Carlyle Group and Blackstone Group LP have also set up
yuan-denominated funds in the past year raising capital from
Chinese investors and targeting China investments.  
 Orrick was the world’s 33rd highest-grossing law firm in
2009 according to the American Lawyer.  
 “Maurice is another step towards our desire to build a
market-leading corporate practice in China and Asia,” said
Michelle Taylor, head of the firm’s Hong Kong, Shanghai and
Beijing offices.
