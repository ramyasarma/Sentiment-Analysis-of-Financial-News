             Moody’s Corp. and McGraw-Hill Cos.’
Standard & Poor’s unit lost a bid to dismiss a lawsuit claiming
the two rating companies misled investors in a structured
investment vehicle known as Rhinebridge.  
 U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin didn’t rule on the
merits of the 2009 case and said only that the investors had
alleged enough facts for the lawsuit to go forward.  
 “The risk that caused plaintiffs’ losses -- that
Rhinebridge consisted of toxic assets that would become
worthless -- was precisely within the zone of risk concealed by
the top ratings” given by the ratings companies, the judge said
in a 29-page opinion issued yesterday in New York.  
 The institutional investors who sued -- King County,
Washington, and the Iowa Student Loan Liquidity Corp. -- claimed
the ratings companies and other defendants such as IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG, the German lender that managed the SIV,
misrepresented the value of Rhinebridge and its debt.  
 The plaintiffs were among states and local governments that
invested in SIVs. The investment vehicles issued short-term debt
and used the proceeds to purchase higher-yielding mortgages,
credit card receivables or other loans. After credit dried up
and Rhinebridge collapsed, the plaintiffs sued, saying “false”
evaluations hid the risks.
    Frank Briamonte, a spokesman for McGraw-Hill, and Thomas
Lemmon, a spokesman for Moody’s, didn’t have immediate comment.
