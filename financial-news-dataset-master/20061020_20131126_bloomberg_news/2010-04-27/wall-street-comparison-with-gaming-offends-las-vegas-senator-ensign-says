             Most people in Las Vegas would
“take offense” at being compared with Wall Street, according
to the Nevada senator who represents the gambling capital.  
 “In Las Vegas, most people know that the odds are stacked
against them,” John Ensign, a Nevada Republican, said
today at a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
hearing on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “On Wall Street they
manipulate the odds while you’re playing the game.”  
 The panel was grilling current and former executives of
Goldman Sachs today as senators probed the bank’s mortgage
business and its role in the collapse of those markets.
Lawmakers have likened Wall Street practices to a casino and
said they lacked economic purpose.  
 The gambling theme was raised earlier during the Washington
hearing by Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, who joined
senators including Chairman Carl Levin of Michigan who
disparaged securities sold by Goldman Sachs as bets.  
 “You are the bookie, you are the house,” McCaskill told
the day’s first panel of witnesses. “You had less oversight
than a pit boss in Las Vegas.”
