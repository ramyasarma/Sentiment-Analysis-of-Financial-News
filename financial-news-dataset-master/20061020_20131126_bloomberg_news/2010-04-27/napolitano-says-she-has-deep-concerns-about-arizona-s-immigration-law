             Homeland Security Secretary Janet
Napolitano told U.S. lawmakers her agency has “deep concerns,”
about a new immigration law in Arizona and said the U.S. should
pursue a comprehensive overhaul of its immigration policies.  
 Attorney General Eric Holder, at a news conference in
Washington, said he also has concerns and said the Justice
Department is considering going to court to challenge the
Arizona statute.  
 The new Arizona law “will detract from and siphon
resources that we need to focus on those in the country
illegally who are committing serious crimes, in addition to
violating our nation’s immigration laws,” Napolitano told
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee today.  
 Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed legislation last week
that would make it a state crime to be in the U.S. illegally and
require local police to determine the immigration status of
anyone an officer suspects of being in the country without
proper documentation.  
 Napolitano, a former Arizona governor, said the Justice
Department was reviewing the law, which has yet to take effect,
and “will look at whether the law meets constitutional
safeguards or not.”  
 She said the law may create an “undue” barrier between
crime victims and law enforcement officers.  
 Napolitano, a Democrat, gave up the governorship in early
2009 to take the homeland security post under President Barack
Obama. Brewer, a Republican, was Arizona’s secretary of state
and succeeded Napolitano.  
 The new immigration law sparked protests in Arizona, where
Census Bureau figures show about a quarter of the population is
of Hispanic descent. The state also shares a border with Mexico
and has an estimated 460,000 residents living there illegally,
the seventh highest total in the country, according to the
Homeland Security Department.  
 Obama on April 23 called for overhauling the nation’s
immigration laws, saying a failure to do so will lead to
“misguided” efforts such as legislation passed in Arizona.  
 Napolitano said “comprehensive immigration reform should
be in our sights” as the U.S. continues efforts to secure the
southwest border.
