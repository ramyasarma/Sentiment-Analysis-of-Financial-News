             Brazilian central bank President
Henrique Meirelles told President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva that
the country’s benchmark interest rate needs a “hit,” Folha de
S. Paulo reported, citing a presidential aide it didn’t name.  
 Meirelles explained to the president that raising the Selic
rate at a faster pace would result in lower political stress for
the country and have a quicker effect on the economy, the
newspaper reported. Lula previously expected a gradual rate
increase, Folha said.  
 The central bank’s press office didn’t immediately return a
message left by Bloomberg News.
