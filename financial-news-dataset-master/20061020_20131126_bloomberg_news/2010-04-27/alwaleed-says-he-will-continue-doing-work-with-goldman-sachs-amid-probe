             Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal
said he will continue working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
after the U.S. regulator sued the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history for misleading its investors.  
 “I’ll continue to work with Goldman Sachs” and await the
results of the investigation, Alwaleed, Saudi Arabia’s richest
businessman, said in an interview with Bloomberg television in
Riyadh today. “Any company or person is always innocent until
proven guilty.”  
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs on April 16 for failing to tell investors in a 2007
collateralized debt obligation that hedge fund Paulson & Co.
played a part in selecting the underlying assets while it also
planned to bet against the CDO.  
 Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55,
and six other current and former employees will appear before
the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations as the
Senate debates financial reform legislation that could prevent
banks from trading for their own accounts. Those appearing
before the committee include Fabrice Tourre, the banker at the
center of the SEC’s complaint.  
 Goldman Sachs is fighting the SEC’s lawsuit, which it says
is “unfounded in law and fact.”
