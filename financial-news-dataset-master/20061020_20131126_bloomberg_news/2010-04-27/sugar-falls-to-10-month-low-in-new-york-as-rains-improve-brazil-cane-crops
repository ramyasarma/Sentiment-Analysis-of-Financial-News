             Raw sugar fell to the lowest price
in more than 10 months on speculation that favorable weather is
benefiting cane crops in Brazil, the world’s largest grower.  
 Sugar production jumped 77 percent in the first half of
April from a year earlier, industry association Unica said
today. Regular rains will help boost the cane harvest to a
record this year, Agriculture Minister Wagner Rossi told the
Folha de S. Paulo newspaper.  
 “Weather news out of Brazil is currently positive, so we
expect any rally to be sold into by producers,” Nick Penney, a
Sucden Financial Ltd. trader in London, said today in a report.
“This may further erode confidence among the bullish
fraternity.”  
 Raw sugar for July delivery fell 0.48 cent, or 3 percent,
to 15.37 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier,
the price touched 15.25 cents, the lowest level for a most-
active contract since June 8.  
 The close below the previous contract low of 15.45 cents
means prices could drop to 14.88 cents, Penney said in an e-
mail.  
 Sugar has tumbled 43 percent this year. In 2009, sugar
prices more than doubled after excess rain delayed the harvest
in Brazil, compounding a shortage in global supplies.  
 White sugar for August delivery slipped $15.10, or 3.1
percent, to $465 a metric ton on London’s Liffe exchange, after
earlier touching $464.40, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since April 9. The sweetener has dropped 35 percent in
2010.
