             The People’s Bank of China has
started working with Chinese banks to set up a platform that
would help clear online payments between banks, the Financial
Times reported today, citing people close to the matter.  
 The platform would compete with Alibaba-owned Alipay, which
runs the world’s largest online trading platform for business,
the FT said.
