             PTT Exploration & Production Pcl,
Thailand’s only listed oil and gas explorer, said first-quarter
profit jumped 82 percent after output and prices increased.  
 Net income was 10.47 billion baht ($325 million), or 3.16
baht a share, in the three months ended March, from 5.75 billion
baht, or 1.74 baht, a year earlier. The median estimate of six
analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for profit of 8.19 billion
baht.  
 Profit was bolstered by the inclusion of output from the
Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area and higher production
at the company’s Arthit and Arthit North projects in the Gulf of
Thailand. Total revenue increased 30 percent to 34.5 billion
baht. Expenses rose 14 percent to 17.4 billion baht.  
 Higher crude oil prices, increased sales and the absence of
one-time costs also boosted earnings, Tanaporn Visaruthaphong,
an analyst at Kasikorn Securities, said before the announcement.
In the same period a year earlier, the company wrote off 1.58
billion baht in costs related to dry wells, she said.  
 PTT Exploration in January cut its 2010 sales target by 15
percent to 253,796 barrels a day because of production delays
caused by last year’s oil spill and well fire at its Montara
project off the coast of Australia.  
 The company booked Montara-related expenses of 5 billion
baht in the fourth quarter of last year, after recording
expenses of 5.17 billion baht in the third quarter, Chatchawal
Eimsiri, vice president for finance, said Jan. 15.  
 Insurance Gain  
 PTT Exploration expects to book a gain of about $266
million, mostly in 2011, because of insurance coverage for the
oil leak incident, Chatchawal said.  
 The explorer has 41 oil and gas projects in 13 countries,
and has announced plans to spend 429 billion baht from 2010 to
2014 on expansion.  
 PTT Exploration’s petroleum sales probably increased to the
equivalent of 256,000 barrels of oil per day in the first
quarter, from 250,000 barrels in the previous quarter,
Thanatthep Chantarakarn, an analyst at Bualuang Securities, said
in a note dated April 20.
