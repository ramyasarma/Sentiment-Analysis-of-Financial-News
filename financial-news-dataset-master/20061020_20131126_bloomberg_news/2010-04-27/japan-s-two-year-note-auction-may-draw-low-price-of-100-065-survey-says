             Japan’s sale of 2.6 trillion yen
($27.7 billion) of two-year notes may have a lowest-accepted
price of 100.065, according to the median forecast of 13
traders surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 0.2 percent
securities ranged from 100.060 to 100.075, according to the
survey. Nine Traders said 100.065, two said 100.070 and one
trader each reported 100.060 and 100.075.  
 The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
announce the results at 12:45 p.m. in Tokyo.
