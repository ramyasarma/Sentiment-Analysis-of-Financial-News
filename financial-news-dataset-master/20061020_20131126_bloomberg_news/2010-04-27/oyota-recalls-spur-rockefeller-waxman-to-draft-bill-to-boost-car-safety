             Toyota Motor Corp.’s record recalls
for flaws tied to unintended acceleration prompted the chairmen
of two congressional committees to draft auto-safety legislation
targeting carmakers and the highway safety regulator.  
 Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller, a West
Virginia Democrat, said today in a statement that Toyota’s
recalls showed lapses in safety monitoring. House Energy and
Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, a California Democrat,
said he will work with Rockefeller on the measure.  
 “I will introduce legislation that will hold automakers to
a higher standard and strengthen the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration’s ability to more effectively protect
Americans on the road,” Rockefeller said in an e-mailed
statement. The statement didn’t include details on the proposed
legislation.  
 Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, has recalled more
than 8 million vehicles worldwide for defects that may cause
unintended acceleration. Three congressional committees have
held hearings about the recalls.
