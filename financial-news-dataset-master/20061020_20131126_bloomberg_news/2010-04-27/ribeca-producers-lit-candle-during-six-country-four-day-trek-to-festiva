             Getting a film into the  Tribeca
Film Festival  is extremely difficult. For Rebecca O’Flanagan and
Robert Walpole, getting to the festival was even harder.  
 With European air travel halted last week by the volcano in
Iceland, the Irish producers embarked on an exhausting four-day,
six-country trek to get their movie “ My Brothers ” to New York
for its 5 p.m. Friday premiere.  
 The journey included a stop at a church in San Sebastian,
Spain, where they lit a candle for Saint Christopher, the patron
saint of travelers. They also stayed overnight at a chateau in
Bordeaux, France, and witnessed a horrible truck crash between
San Sebastian and Madrid.  
 “It was an amazing adventure,” Walpole, 48, said as he
and O’Flanagan, 38, prepared to enter the  School of Visual Arts
Theatre  in Chelsea for the screening. “Nothing was going to
stop us from getting here.”  
 Starting out from Dublin on Sunday night (April 18), they
took two ferries and drove 17 hours across Wales and England to
reach Madrid, where they caught a flight to Bogota. They then
raced across the terminal to make a flight to Miami, where they
got a few hours sleep before flying to New York.  
 They arrived on Thursday afternoon with the just-finished
final copy of the film. By the time they got to New York air
travel had resumed across Europe, so director Paul Fraser and
cast members were able to fly directly from London and Dublin on
Thursday.  
 “We’re just glad that everyone made it,” O’Flanagan said.
“We couldn’t afford to wait because we didn’t know when the
skies would clear. Getting to Tribeca was obviously very
important to us.”  
 Broken Watch  
 The producers, whose film “The Eclipse” premiered at last
year’s Tribeca festival, encountered dozens of travelers en
route to Madrid, which for a while was the largest European
airport with transatlantic flights. When they reached Madrid,
the airport was overflowing with passengers waiting for flights.  
 “It was like Casablanca” in World War II, O’Flanagan
said.  
 “My Brothers” also involves an eventful road trip, though
a much shorter one. Driving a rickety van, three Irish brothers
travel to a coastal town to find a replacement for their dying
father’s cherished wristwatch, which the eldest son has
accidentally broken.  
 The young brothers are played by amateurs -- Timmy Creed,
Paul Courtney and TJ Griffin -- who had never acted before they
were discovered at auditions in Ireland.  
 During a question-and-answer session after the premiere, 8-
year-old Griffin was asked why he was so composed in his first
role.  
 “Because I’m very good,” he said with an impish smile.
