             The rally in U.S. stocks has lifted
the Russell 2000 Index above a key level that suggests the gauge
will recoup its entire bear-market loss, according to analysts
who use Fibonacci numbers to forecast market moves.  
 The gauge for smaller companies closed yesterday above
735.2, a level where the index recovered 76.4 percent of the
514-point retreat between 2007 and 2009. Analysts who use
historical charts and trading patterns to predict the direction
of equities say the Fibonacci sequence identified by the 13th-
century Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci indicates the
Russell 2000 may reach its 2007 peak of 856.48, or 16 percent
higher than its close yesterday of 738.86.  
 “This suggests that in the medium to longer term a
challenge of the 2007 all time high is a credible prospect,
although we would imagine that some consolidation and back-
filling would be required before the final leg of this journey
commenced,” Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer of
brokerage Oscar Gruss & Son Inc., wrote in a note to clients
yesterday.  
 U.S. stocks started recovering in March 2009, with small
companies outperforming their large rivals. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
benchmarks for bigger companies, both have yet to surpass their
61.8 percent retracements, which Fibonacci analysts say is a
major threshold to claim a full recovery is in sight.
