             Ultra Shape Medical Ltd., the
Israeli developer of fat reduction and body shaping devices,
climbed to the highest level in more than two months after its
technology was featured in Oprah Winfrey’s “O” Magazine.  
 The shares jumped 10 percent 0.088 shekel at 12:01 p.m. in
Tel Aviv, the highest since Feb. 23. The stock has more than
doubled over the past three days, giving the Tel Aviv-based
company a market value of 139.5 million shekels (37.4 million).  
 “The stock began to rise after Ultra Shape posted the
article on its Web site,” on April 25, said spokeswoman Meital
Naim.  
 Ultra Shape’s technology, which is cleared for use in 57
countries, uses ultrasound in a non-invasive procedure that
destroys fat cells without damaging other tissue, according to
its Web site. The company is pursuing U.S. Food & Drug
Administration marketing approval, according to its 2009 annual
report.  
 “It sounds too good to be true, but it may soon be a
reality,” “O” said in an article posted on the magazine’s Web
Site on April 19 that described the Ultra Shape system.
