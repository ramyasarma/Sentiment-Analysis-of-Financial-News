             The United Nations Security Council
pressed today for tougher prosecution of pirates operating off
the coast of Somalia, adopting a Russian proposal to consider
creation of a new court for that purpose.  
 The council voted 15-0 to ask UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon to report within three months on options for “a regional
tribunal or an international tribunal and corresponding
imprisonment arrangements.”  
 Russia circulated the text following Kenya’s decision to
stop prosecuting suspected Somali pirates and cancel agreements
with several naval powers. Kenya has accords with the European
Union, U.S., Britain, Canada, China and Denmark to prosecute
brigands captured by them.  
 Piracy and armed robbery at sea reached a six-year peak in
2009 with Somalia accounting for more than half of the 406
attacks, according to the UN International Maritime Bureau.
Somali pirates mounted 217 attacks last year, hijacking 47 ships
and taking 867 crew members hostage, the London-based bureau
said in January.  
 Eleven men were indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury last
week on piracy charges in connection with attacks on U.S. Navy
ships off the coast of Africa.  
 The men, identified as Somalis by the U.S., were captured
within the past month after attacking or exchanging fire with
Navy vessels, according to authorities. They face charges of
piracy, conspiracy and assault with a dangerous weapon under
indictments unsealed in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia.  
 The U.S. warships were operating as part of an
international flotilla protecting shipping in the region.
