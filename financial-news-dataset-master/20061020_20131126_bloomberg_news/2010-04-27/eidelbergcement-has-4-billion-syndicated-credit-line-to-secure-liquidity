             HeidelbergCement AG said it signed
a 3 billion-euro ($4 billion) syndicated loan to refinance debt
and provide liquidity until the end of 2013.  
 The world’s third-largest cement maker agreed to the
financing with 17 banks at “better conditions,” Chief
Executive Officer Bernd Scheifele said in the statement. The
interest margin on the new facility is “clearly lower” than on
existing debt, the company said, without providing details.  
 HeidelbergCement paid interest of 425 basis points more
than the euro interbank offered rate on money it drew from the
credit line it arranged last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
