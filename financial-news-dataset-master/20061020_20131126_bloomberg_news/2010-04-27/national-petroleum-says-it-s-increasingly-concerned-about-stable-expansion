             China National Petroleum Corp., the
country’s biggest oil company, said long-term stable growth will
increasingly be a concern as the energy producer accelerates its
“go global” strategy.  
 Higher costs and lower returns on investments may challenge
long-term development, President Jiang Jiemin said in the
company’s online newsletter today, without elaborating.  
 Oil in New York has more than doubled from a four-year low
of $32.40 a barrel on Dec. 19, 2008, increasing the cost of
China’s energy acquisitions to supply the world’s fastest-
growing major economy. CNPC’s Hong Kong-listed unit PetroChina
Co. plans to spend at least $60 billion in the next decade on
overseas assets, Jiang said on March 29.  
 CNPC’s first-quarter overseas crude oil output jumped 13
percent from a year earlier while gas production abroad surged
67 percent, the Beijing-based company said yesterday. Oil-
product sales rose 17 percent.  
 The fast pace of growth in the first three months was
because of a low comparative base, Jiang said in the statement.
“The foundation for sustainable development is still not
stable,” he said.
