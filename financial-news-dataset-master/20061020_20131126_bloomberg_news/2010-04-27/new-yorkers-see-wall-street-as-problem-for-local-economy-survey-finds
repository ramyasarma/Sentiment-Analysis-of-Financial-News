             More than half of New Yorkers, 56
percent, see Wall Street as more of a problem than a solution
when it comes to the city’s economy, according to a Marist Poll
released today.  
 Just 24 percent of those surveyed said Wall Street was more
of a solution for the city’s economy, while 20 percent were
unsure, according to the survey of 684 New York City residents
conducted by telephone on April 21-22. The poll has a margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.  
 “Wall Street may be part of New York City’s economic
engine, but even here, New Yorkers point to its pitfalls,” Lee
Miringoff, director of the Poughkeepsie, New York-based Marist
Institute for Public Opinion, said in a statement. “It doesn’t
boost Wall Street to be New York City’s ‘Main Street.’”  
 Seven current and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
employees, including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein,
are testifying in Washington today about the firm’s mortgage-
securities business in the years leading up to the biggest
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Goldman is
contesting a fraud lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, saying it gave investors all the information they
needed.  
 The Marist survey also found that 48 percent of registered
voters say they think New York City is heading in the wrong
direction, while 41 percent say they believe it’s on the right
path.  
 A Marist poll conducted earlier in the month found 47
percent of registered voters said they thought the city was
headed in the right direction while 45 percent said it was going
the wrong way.
