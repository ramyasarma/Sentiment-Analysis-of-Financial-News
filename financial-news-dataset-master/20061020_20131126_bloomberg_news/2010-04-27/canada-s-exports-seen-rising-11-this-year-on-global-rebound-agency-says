             Canada’s exports will rise by 11
percent this year and 7 percent in 2011 as the global economy
rebounds, the country’s export finance arm said.  
 Global gross domestic product will expand 3.7 percent this
year, following a 1.1 percent contraction last year, Export
Development Canada said in an update of its projections.
Canada’s economy will grow 2.5 percent in 2010 and 2.9 percent
next year, the agency predicted.
