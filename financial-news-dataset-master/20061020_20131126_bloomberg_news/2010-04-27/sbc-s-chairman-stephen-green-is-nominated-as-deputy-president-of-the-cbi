             HSBC Holdings Plc Chairman Stephen
Green has been nominated to become deputy president of the
Confederation of British Industry, the business lobby group.  
 CBI members will vote on May 24 on his nomination with a
view to his succeeding Helen Alexander as president on June 1,
2011, for two years, the CBI said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “There are signs of economic recovery, but conditions
remain distinctly fragile and business and government have to
work together to secure the conditions we need,” for lasting
growth, Green said in the statement.  
 Green, 61, became chief executive officer of HSBC, Europe’s
biggest bank, in 2003 and chairman in 2006. Green, a Church of
England lay minister, may be a candidate to become the next
governor of the Bank of England, the Times newspaper reported in
January.
