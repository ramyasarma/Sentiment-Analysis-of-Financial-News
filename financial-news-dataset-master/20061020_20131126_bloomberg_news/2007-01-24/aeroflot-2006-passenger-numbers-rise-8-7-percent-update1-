             OAO Aeroflot (AFLT) , eastern  Europe 's largest
airline, carried 8.7 percent more passengers last year as the
country's growing economy boosted travel.  
 State-controlled Aeroflot flew 7.3 million passengers in 2006,
the Moscow-based airline said today in a statement. The company
handled 0.2 percent less cargo, or 145,300 tons, last year. The
 load factor , or proportion of seats filled, increased to 70.1
percent from 69.1 percent in 2005.  
 Aeroflot is attracting more travelers as  Russia 's economy
expands for a ninth consecutive year, backed by rising oil prices.
The carrier joined the SkyTeam alliance of Air France-KLM Group and
Delta Air Lines Inc. in April.  
 The company declined to provide information on the number of
passengers carried on domestic and international flights.  
 ``We have a directive not to give out those figures,''
spokeswoman Irina Dannenberg said in a telephone interview from
Moscow today. She said the company may provide it at a later date.  
 Aeroflot said in the statement that revenue under Russian
accounting standards increased 18.5 percent, without providing the
full figure.  
 OAO  Siberia Airlines (AVSI) , Russia's second-largest carrier, flew
4.9 million passengers, or 16.4 percent more, spokesman Ilya Novokhatsky said in a telephone interview today. The airline flew
60 percent of its passengers on domestic routes and 40 percent on
international.  
 GTK Rossiya, the state airline which last year absorbed
Pulkovo, Russia's third-largest carrier, said it flew more than 3
million passengers last year, including 1.4 million on
international routes. The company did not provide comparative
figures for 2005.
