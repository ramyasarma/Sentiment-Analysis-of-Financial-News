             ``American Idol,'' the most popular
show in primetime television, withstood last week's criticism
over judging and returned last night with the third-largest
audience for an entertainment show this season.  
 With about 32.6 million viewers, according to overnight
results from Nielsen Media Research, the latest ``Idol'' trailed
only the two ``Idol'' shows that opened its sixth season on Fox
last week with audiences of 37.4 million and 37 million and the
National Football League's American Conference championship game
on CBS last Sunday, which drew 43.5 million.  
 The first two ``Idol'' shows were the second and third most-watched of the series since the show's 2002 debut. They also
spurred criticism that two of the judges, Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson, were mean-spirited in their critique of some of the
singers.  
 ``Controversy breeds interest,'' said Bill Carroll, vice
president and director of programming at the Katz Television
Group in New York. ``A good dustup and some inopportune words
cause even the casual viewer to check out what's going on.''  
 The dip in ``Idol'' viewers last night reflected the
``little bit of leveling off'' that some shows experience,
Carroll said.  
 Bush Speech  
 The schedule was also altered by President Bush's  State of
the Union  address, which the four networks, ABC, CBS, NBC and
Fox, all carried live. The president's speech attracted 32.7
million viewers across the networks.  
 ``Idol'' was the highest-rated individual show of the night,
surpassing its audience of 30.2 million in the same week last
year when Bush spoke.  
 ``It was in line with what most people would have
anticipated,'' said Carroll. Katz advises TV stations on
programming. ``That's really all you can ask for.''  
 The success of ``Idol'' stems, in part, from the post-performance assessments by the judges -- Cowell, Jackson and
Paula Abdul -- before singers are sent home or to Los Angeles for
the next round of competition.  
 Last week, Cowell angered fans of the show when he described
a big-eyed singer with questionable talent as a ``bush baby.''
Fans on the Internet said Cowell had gone too far.  
 Speaking to television reporters last Saturday in  Pasadena ,
 California , Cowell defended himself.  
 ``We all say things which we're going to get criticized
for,'' Cowell said. ``But don't condemn somebody for being a bit
wacky occasionally, or whatever, because it makes it interesting.
Otherwise, it's going to be, like, just a boring show.''  
 Viewers would feel cheated if `Idol'' only showed those
singers with talent. The others, he said, are part of ``the fun
and wackiness of this show.''  
 `Grey's Anatomy'  
 ``Idol'' isn't the only show that has shrugged off
controversy this season.  
 ``Grey's Anatomy'' has also kept up ratings in the face of
controversy over one of its stars, Isaiah  Washington , using an
antigay slur to describe another cast member, T.R. Knight.  
 ``Grey's,'' the leading show on ABC, last week drew an
audience of 21.9 million, beating a new episode of CBS's ``CSI,''
which drew 21.4 million.  
 Public feuding also helped ABC's daytime talk show, ``The
View.''  
 A public spat between one of its regular hosts, Rosie O'Donnell, and real estate developer Donald Trump over Trump's
defense of a beauty pageant contestant, helped boost viewership
of ``The View'' to an average 3.3 million in the fourth quarter
of last year, a 13 percent increase and the best quarter ever for
the 10-year-old show, according to Nielsen.  
 ``As long as people are not overly malicious, there's
buzz,'' said Carroll of Katz Television Group. ``And any buzz is
good buzz.''  
 Trump's own show, ``The Apprentice: Los Angeles,'' may be an
exception. The sixth season of the series has steadily lost
viewers each week, falling from 9.1 million in its premier three
weeks ago to 6.9 million last Sunday.
