             Washington Post Co. (WPO) , publisher of the
namesake newspaper, said second-quarter profit fell 13 percent as
publishing revenue declined. The stock had its biggest gain in
almost eight years after sales at the company's Kaplan education
unit increased 23 percent.  
 Net income fell to $68.8 million, or $7.19 a share, from
$78.7 million, or $8.17, the Washington-based company said today
in a statement. Sales rose 8 percent to $1.05 billion.  
 The company's expansion into the Kaplan test-preparation and
training business enabled it to weather the slump in advertising
revenue at newspapers. Kaplan now accounts for about half of
Washington Post's sales. Publishing revenue dropped 7 percent to
$227.9 million after a decline in classified ads.  
 ``Kaplan's growth was blistering,'' said Thomas Russo, who
helps manage $3 billion at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster,
 Pennsylvania . ``They can't declare victory, but advertising
numbers were stronger than expected.'' Gardner Russo owned about
185,000 Washington Post shares in March.  
 Washington Post  shares  rose $40.10 to $832 at 12:59 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . They rose earlier to
$850, or 7.3 percent, their biggest gain since November 1999.
They had risen 6.2 percent this year before today.  
 The Post's ad sales declined 13 percent to $128.4 million.
Classifieds revenue fell 22 percent.  
 Excluding some gains and expenses, profit fell to $8.16 a
share from $9.24 a year earlier. Total sales rose from $969
million a year earlier.  
 Kaplan's Revenue  
 Kaplan's revenue rose 23 percent to $503.5 million. This
year, the unit acquired U.S. CPA Success, a Canadian test-preparation business; Sagemont Virtual, an online private high
school; and a professional training business in  Australia .  
 Ad revenue at U.S. newspapers was hurt by slumping real
estate ads and classifieds. Ad sales declined 11 percent at
Tribune Co. and 6.9 percent at New York Times Co., the companies
reported last week at the newspaper.  
 The Post expanded its Web site to attract advertisers.
Classified ad sales in the second quarter rose 11 percent on
Washingtonpost.com.
