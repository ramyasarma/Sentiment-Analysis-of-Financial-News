             Iliad SA (ILD) ,  France 's third-largest
provider of broadband  Internet access  to consumers, said second-quarter sales rose 31 percent as it added subscribers for its
fast Web service.  
 Sales climbed to 296.2 million euros ($405.9 million) from
226.4 million euros a year earlier, Paris-based Iliad said in an
e-mailed statement today. The year-earlier number excludes
revenue from two divested units.  
 Neuf Cegetel SA in July acquired Deutsche Telekom AG's T-Online France to overtake Iliad as the country's second-largest
provider of asymmetric digital subscriber lines, or ADSL, which
allow high-speed hookups via traditional copper phone lines.
Larger rival  France Telecom SA (FTE)  yesterday reported a 23 percent
jump in French broadband Internet clients.  
 ``Iliad's 25 percent market share of net adds means they won
share again in the second quarter,'' analyst  David George  at
Credit Suisse said in a research note.  
 The shares rose 1.11 euros, or 1.6 percent, to close at
68.81 euros in Paris, giving the Internet-access company a market
value of 3.73 billion euros.  
 Customer Additions  
 The company said it accounted for about 25 percent of all
net additional ADSL subscriptions in France, compared with 21
percent a year earlier. The company has a target of 2.8 million
ADSL clients this year and 4 million broadband customers by the
end of 2010.  
 Based on the first-half performance, Iliad said it ``should
exceed its 2.8 million ADSL subscribers target by end 2007.''
Revenue growth excluding divestments was ``strong in a seasonally
weak quarter,'' Iliad said.  
 Iliad's Internet unit Free added 128,000 subscribers in the
second quarter, less than the record 220,000 new subscribers in
the first three months of 2007, for a total of 2.62 million.
 France Telecom  has 6.58 million ADSL subscribers at the end of
June and Neuf Cegetel had 3.02 million clients for the service,
according to Iliad figures.  
 Iliad's gross margin per subscriber exceeded 20 euros in the
first half and the company said it plans to maintain this margin
level.  
 Iliad competes with France Telecom and Neuf Cegetel  in
asymmetric digital subscriber lines, or ADSL, which allow high-speed links via copper phone lines.  
 For the first half,  sales  climbed to 574.1 million euros
from 439.1 million euros a year earlier.
