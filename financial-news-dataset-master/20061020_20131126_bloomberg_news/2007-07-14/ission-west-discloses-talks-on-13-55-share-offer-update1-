             Mission West Properties Inc. (MSW) , a real
estate investment trust with properties in California's Silicon
Valley, said it's in talks with a private equity fund about
being acquired for $13.55 a share in cash, or about $1.8
billion.  
 The company, based in Cupertino, California, didn't
identify the bidder or say how far along the talks were. There
isn't a definitive agreement, Mission West said in a statement
distributed on PR Newswire. The price offered is less than
Mission West's closing price yesterday of $13.69.  
 The company manages 107 research and development properties
totaling about 7.7 million square feet (715,353 square meters)
of space, Mission West said in the statement.  
 The company's four biggest tenants were  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ,
Apple Inc., the U.S. unit of NEC Electronics Corp. and Ciena
Corp., according to Mission West's annual Form 10-K filed in
March with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 Mission West shares have gained 25 percent in the past
year.
