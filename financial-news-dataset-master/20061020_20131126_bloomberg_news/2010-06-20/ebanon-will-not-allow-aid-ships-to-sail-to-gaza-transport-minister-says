             Lebanon will not grant permission
for ships to sail from its coast to the Gaza Strip,  An Nahar 
reported, citing Lebanese Minister of Transport and Public Works
 Ghazi Aridi .  
 The organizers of an aid mission aboard the ship “Julia,”
which is moored in the northern port of Tripoli, have not
submitted an official request to sail, Aridi told the newspaper.  
 Israel said in letters to the United Nations on June 18
that it may take military action to block ships bound from
Lebanon, which it said were possibly organized by Hezbollah, the
Lebanese militant group which fought a war with the Jewish state
in 2006.  
 Hezbollah denied in an official  statement  on June 18 that
it was sponsoring any aid ships planning to break the Israeli
embargo on Gaza, saying it did not want to give Israel any
excuse to attack the activists.
