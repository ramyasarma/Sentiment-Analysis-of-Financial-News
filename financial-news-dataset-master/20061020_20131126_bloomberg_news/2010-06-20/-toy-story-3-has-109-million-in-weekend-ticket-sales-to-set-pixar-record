             Walt Disney Co. ’s “Toy Story 3”
was the top movie at U.S. and Canadian theaters this weekend
with $109 million in ticket sales, a record opening for its
Pixar studio.  
 It’s Pixar’s 11th debut at No. 1 and the second-highest
opening for an animated feature, falling between “Shrek The
Third” ($121.6 million) and “Shrek 2” ($108 million),
 Hollywood.com Box-Office  said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement.  
 “Toy Story 3”  is the first 3-D sequel of the animated
series. The film, featuring the voices of  Tom Hanks  as
Woody and  Tim Allen  as Buzz Lightyear, follows the toys’ attempt
to reunite with their owner, Andy, who is leaving for college.
 Gitesh Pandya , editor of Box Office Guru LLC, projected the
movie to take in $95 million in ticket sales.  
 “Pixar is arguably the strongest movie brand out there
right now and ‘Toy Story 3’ has continued their reign,” said
 Brandon Gray , president of Box Office Mojo, a research company
in Sherman Oaks, California. “It’s hard to knock Pixar because
they are 11 for 11.”  
 The movie, shown in 4,028 theaters, is the third film this
year to open at $100 million or more. It joins Paramount’s
“Iron Man 2” ($128.1 million) and Disney’s “Alice in
Wonderland” ($116.1 million), Hollywood.com said.  
 Movie studios are turning to 3-D films to bolster
attendance and ticket sales. Cinemas on average charge about $3
more per ticket for a 3-D film.  
 ‘The Karate Kid’  
 “With 3-D, they’re making more from fewer people,” said
Gray. “It was probably a fairly significant boost since it was
60 percent of the business.”  
 Prior to this weekend, “The Incredibles” (2004) had been
Pixar’s highest-grossing opening film with $70.5 million in
receipts, according to Hollywood.com.  
 Rounding out the top five spots, “The Karate Kid,” a
remake of the 1984 film, was second and had sales of $29 million
for  Sony Corp. , Hollywood.com said.  
 “The A-Team,” an update of the 1980s television series,
fell to third place from second with $13.8 million for  News
Corp. ’s Fox Film studio. The film, starring  Liam Neeson  and
Bradley Cooper, has taken in $49.8 million in two weeks.  
 “Get Him to the Greek” remained in fourth place with
sales of $6.1 million. The  Judd Apatow-produced  film stars Jonah
Hill as a record-company intern assigned to bring an out-of-
control rock star, played by  Russell Brand , to Los Angeles from
London in three days.  
 ‘Grown Ups’  
 “Shrek Forever After,” from Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc.
and Viacom Inc.’s Paramount Pictures, fell to fifth place from
third with $5.52 million. “Shrek,” the fourth film in the
animated franchise, has had sales of $223 million since its May
21 release.  
 Opening next weekend are  News Corp. ’s “Knight and Day”
starring  Tom Cruise  and  Cameron Diaz  and  Sony Corp. ’s “Grown
Ups” with a cast that includes  Chris Rock ,  Adam Sandler  and
 Kevin James .  
 Weekend sales for the top 12 films rose to $187.9 million
from $144.6 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Year-to-
date receipts total $4.95 billion, up about 4.1 percent from
$4.75 billion. Attendance has fallen 2.4 percent this year.
