             Elpida Memory Inc., Powertech
Technology Inc. and United Microelectronics Corp. will ally to
develop chip-packaging technology, Nikkei English News said,
without citing anyone.  
 The companies will work on technology to stack chips
vertically so they occupy less space, the report said.  
 The companies may make an announcement on the alliance as
early as this week, the report said.
