             The yuan’s appreciation may be
limited to 1.9 percent against the dollar this year as the
euro’s slump hurts exporters, a survey of economists showed
after China signaled an end to a two-year peg.  
 The currency will probably climb to 6.7 per dollar by Dec.
31, according to the median estimate of 14 analysts interviewed
after the People’s Bank of China  said  yesterday it will allow
greater “flexibility.” The central bank ruled out “large-
scale appreciation” and said it will prevent “excessive” moves.  
 Gains may be limited because the yuan already strengthened
16.5 percent against the euro this year, eroding earnings for
Chinese exporters in the European Union, the nation’s largest
market. U.S. Senator Charles Schumer said lawmakers will push
ahead with proposals for trade sanctions until they are
convinced the advance is fast enough to allow fair competition.  
 “The yuan’s appreciation against the dollar may be limited
over the next six months after the Chinese currency gained
significantly against the euro,” said  Ma Jun , a Hong Kong-based
economist for Deutsche Bank AG, who predicts a gain of 1.9
percent. U.S. politicians can only “declare this a partial
victory,” he added.  
 The outlook for appreciation in the survey is stronger than
that indicated by forwards. The six-month non-deliverable
contract jumped 0.5 percent on June 18 to 6.7596 per dollar,
reflecting bets the yuan will rise 1 percent from the spot rate
of 6.8262.  
 Day One  
 Chinese authorities have prevented the currency from
strengthening against the dollar since July 2008 to help
exporters cope during the global financial crisis. The currency
appreciated 21 percent in the three years after a peg to the
dollar was scrapped in July 2005 and replaced by a managed float
against a basket of currencies including the euro.  
 The yuan may advance 0.2 percent to 6.815 tomorrow and 0.4
percent this week, according to the median estimate of six
analysts who gave forecasts. The central bank sets the reference
rate for yuan trading at around 9:15 a.m. every day and allows
the currency to fluctuate up to 0.5 percent from the fixing.  
 “The PBOC will probably keep the reference rate stable on
Monday,” said  Lu Zhengwei , an economist at Industrial Bank Co.
in Shanghai, who predicts a 0.1 percent gain this year. “It
needs to watch the market’s responses to the flexibility
statement. Market participants won’t make bold moves either.
They are waiting for more signals from the PBOC.”  
 The central bank, which has accumulated $2.4 trillion in
currency  reserves  intervening in currency markets, said it will
maintain the trading band and curb inflows of short-term
speculative capital.  
 Depreciation Possible  
 Authorities will “ensure the exchange rate’s fluctuation
is controllable and prevent the possibility of market forces
causing excessive adjustment in the rate,” the central bank
 said  in a statement today.  
 “We can’t exclude the possibility of yuan depreciation,”
said  Shen Jianguang , Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.’s chief
economist for Greater China, who said a 2.5 percent drop is
possible this year if the dollar-euro rate is unchanged. Even
so, he added, China needs to show flexibility in its currency
before the Group of 20 summit in Toronto on June 26-27.  
 Textiles makers stand to lose the most from appreciation
and some would “face bankruptcy” with profit margins as low as
3 percent,  Zhang Wei , vice chairman of the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade, said in March. Europe’s debt
crisis has added to pressure on their earnings. Swift Umbrella
Co., based in the southern Chinese province of Fujian, was
forced by European buyers to cut prices 6 percent this year, Xu
Youchuan, sales manager, said in a June 2 interview.  
 Balance of Payments  
 China’s narrowing balance-of-payments gap indicates that
there’s no basis for “large-scale appreciation” in the yuan,
the central bank said yesterday. The current-account surplus,
for trade in goods and services, narrowed 32 percent to $297.1
billion in 2009, government data show.  
 Exports have been rebounding, exceeding imports by $19.5
billion in May, from a $1.68 billion surplus in April and a
deficit of $7.24 billion in March.  Overseas sales  jumped 48.5
percent in May from a year earlier, customs bureau data show.  
 Benefits From Gains  
 The World Bank said last week that a stronger currency
would help China cool  inflation , which accelerated to a 19-month
high of 3.1 percent in May, higher than the government’s full-
year target of 3 percent. Yuan gains would also give more room
for Asian currencies to strengthen after the euro’s record
depreciation prompted exporters from Taiwan to South Korea to
call for currency controls to protect their earnings.  
 Companies focused on the Chinese market, including Beijing-
based computer maker  Lenovo Group Ltd.  and  Shanghai-based China
Eastern Airlines Corp. , said in March that they would gain from
lower import costs and stronger consumer purchasing power.  
 “A 3 percent gain against the dollar won’t have any major
impact on exports this year,” said Chen Chao, ICBC Credit Suisse
Asset Management Co.’s chief economist. “Whether the yuan will
rise or fall against the dollar will depend on the dollar’s
movement against other currencies.”
