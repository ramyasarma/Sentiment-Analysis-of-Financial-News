             President  Barack Obama ’s handling of
 BP Plc ’s leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has damaged
relations between the U.K. and U.S., the  Sunday Times  reported,
citing a YouGov Plc poll.  
 Sixty-four percent of the British people surveyed by YouGov
and 47 percent of the U.S. residents polled said Obama’s actions
in response to the spill hurt the relationship between the two
countries, the Sunday Times said. In both nations, 22 percent of
people surveyed said Obama is anti-British, the newspaper said.  
 The poll also found 54 percent of British people have a
favorable attitude toward the U.S., compared with 66 percent
asked before the oil spill, the Sunday Times said. YouGov polled
almost 1,500 U.K. residents and about 600 U.S. people, according
to the report.
