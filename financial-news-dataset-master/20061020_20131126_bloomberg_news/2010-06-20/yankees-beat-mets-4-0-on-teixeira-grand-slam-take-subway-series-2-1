             The New York Yankees beat the New
York Mets 4-0 on a fourth-inning grand slam by  Mark Teixeira  to
win their Major League Baseball “Subway Series” two games to
one.  
 Teixeira’s left-field home run scored  Derek Jeter ,  Nick Swisher  and  Brett Gardner  for the only runs of the game at
Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.  
 Jeter was scratched by manager  Joe Girardi  90 minutes
before yesterday’s game because of a bruised heel sustained in a
4-0 loss to the Mets two days ago. Jeter is baseball’s leader
with 311 interleague hits and is a career .378 hitter against
the Mets.  
 The Yankees won the second game in the series 5-3 yesterday
to snap a three-game losing streak and end the Mets’ eight-game
winning string. The Mets won this season’s first series between
the teams 2-1 at Citi Field in Queens last month.  
 CC Sabathia  (8-3) had six strikeouts and allowed four hits
in eight innings today to get the win. After a 22-minute rain
delay in the top of the eighth inning,  Mariano Rivera  replaced
Sabathia and needed 13 pitches to get the last three outs.  
 Johan Santana  took the loss to drop to 5-4 for the season
after allowing four runs and eight hits in six innings. Santana
allowed one run over 7 2/3 innings in a 6-4 victory May 23 as he
defeated Sabathia, who gave up six runs over five innings.  
 Today’s win, combined with a 9-8 defeat in 11 innings for
the Tampa Bay Rays (42-27) against the Florida Marlins, gives
the Yankees (43-26) the outright lead in the American League
East Division for the first time since April 12.  
 The Mets (39-30) are second in the National League East, 2½
games behind the Atlanta Braves (42-28), who beat the Kansas
City Royals 8-5.
