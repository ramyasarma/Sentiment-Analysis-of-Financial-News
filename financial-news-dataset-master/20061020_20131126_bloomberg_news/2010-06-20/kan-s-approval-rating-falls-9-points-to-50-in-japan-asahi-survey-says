             Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan
has an approval rating of 50 percent in an Asahi newspaper
survey taken June 19-20, down 9 percentage points from June
12-13. His disapproval rating rose 4 points to 27 percent.  
 Support for Kan’s Democratic Party of Japan was 32 percent,
down 8 percentage points. The support level for the opposition
Liberal Democratic Party rose 1 point to 13 percent, the
newspaper said.  
 Forty-six percent of respondents said they would support an
increase in the country’s consumption tax to 10 percent, while
45 percent said they would oppose such a plan.   
 The Asahi took the survey by telephone and obtained 1,025
valid responses. The newspaper didn’t provide a margin of error.

                     June 21 (Bloomberg) -- Andrew Colquhoun, director at Fitch Ratings Asia-Pacific sovereign group, talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about the outlook for Japan's credit rating and fiscal policy.
     Colquhoun, speaking from Tokyo, also discusses China's shift in currency policy, and its implications for the nation's economy. The People’s Bank of China two days ago indicated it’s abandoning the 6.83 yuan peg to the dollar adopted during the global crisis to shield exporters. The central bank said while there’s no basis for “large scale” moves in the currency, the exchange rate will be allowed increased “flexibility.” (Source: Bloomberg)
