             Japan’s  bonds  may rise for a third
day on speculation the yen’s appreciation to a three-week high
versus the dollar will damp the outlook for exporters’ earnings,
boosting demand for the relative safety of debt.  
 Ten-year yields may fall toward the lowest level since
December 2008 as the yen gained after China said on June 19
that it will allow a more flexible yuan and signaled an end to
the currency’s peg to the dollar. Bonds may also advance before
a report this week forecast to show U.S. new home sales dropped,
adding to signs economic recovery is slowing.  
 “I would like to see how the yuan’s appreciation will
affect stocks,” said  Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist in Tokyo
at Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc. “If good conditions for
bonds continue from last weekend, we may see yields drop below
1.190 percent toward 1.155 percent.”  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery traded at
