             U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  will announce a bank tax in two days aiming to
raise 3 billion pounds ($4.5 billion), the  Sunday Times 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The tax will be based on banks’ balance sheets rather than
their earnings, the newspaper said.  
 Osborne will also proceed with a plan to levy a capital-
gains tax at around 40 percent on non-business assets and will
soften corporation tax when he announces his budget plans, the
Sunday Times reported.
