             New Zealand took almost 30 years to
earn its first World Cup point and just five days to double the
tally in a surprise 1-1 tie with defending champion Italy.  
 After starting with a 1-1 draw against Slovakia, New 
Zealand yesterday secured its best-ever soccer result in its 
second game, according to coach Ricki Herbert, who played 
on the only other All Whites’ team to reach the tournament in 1982.  
 “I think our entire country, which numbers 4 million
inhabitants, came to a stop to watch our performance,” Herbert
told reporters after the match in Nelspruit, South Africa.
“It’s historic and greater than anything else we’ve ever
achieved when you consider the standing of our opponents.”  
 Home to the  top-ranked  All Blacks rugby union team, New
Zealand doesn’t have a professional soccer league and its only
full-time team, the Wellington Phoenix, plays in Australia’s A-
League. Italy, which won its fourth World Cup title four years
ago in Germany, has four divisions and boasts the current
European champion, Inter Milan.  
 “It leaves me speechless when I think about what we’ve
accomplished,” New Zealand captain  Ryan Nelsen  told reporters.
“We’ve given ourselves a chance of reaching the next round and
that’s an exciting challenge.”  
 Only  Vincenzo Iaquinta’s  penalty kick in the 29th minute
spared Italy from the greater upset of losing to a team ranked
73 places below it by governing body FIFA. Shane Smeltz had
given the All Whites the lead in the seventh minute with his
team’s only shot on target.  
 The New Zealanders held off the Italians, who had nine
attempts on target, for the remaining 61 minutes and came close
to getting a second goal in the closing stages when substitute
Chris Wood hit a left-foot shot inches wide of the post.  
 ‘Hardest Work’  
 “It was the hardest work that we’ve ever put in,” Nelsen
said in a televised interview. “It’s all we wanted to do: give
ourselves an opportunity in the last game.”  
 Herbert’s squad, which qualified by beating Bahrain in a
playoff after topping an Oceania qualifying section featuring 10
other  low-ranked South Pacific nations , will enter its final
Group F match on June 24 against group leader Paraguay tied on
two points with Italy.  
 “From now on, everything is possible,” Herbert said.
“And we’re doing pretty well for a team that according to some
people had no place at this World Cup.”
