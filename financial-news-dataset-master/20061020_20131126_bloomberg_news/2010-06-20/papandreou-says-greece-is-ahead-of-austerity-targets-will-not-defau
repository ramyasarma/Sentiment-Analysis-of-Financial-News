             Greece’s austerity program is ahead
of targets and will ensure the country will be able to meet
obligations to its creditors, Prime Minister George Papandreou
said.  
 Shrinking the public sector will “give us a cushion” and
“give us quite a bit of money,” Papandreou said today in an
interview on “Bloomberg on the Economy with Tom Keene.” At the
same time, he said, the program gives the government more
credibility and is “convincing our citizens not to be as tax
evasive as they have in the past.”  
 Papandreou said a default by Greece “is not inevitable”
and “we are a credible partner to our creditors.”
