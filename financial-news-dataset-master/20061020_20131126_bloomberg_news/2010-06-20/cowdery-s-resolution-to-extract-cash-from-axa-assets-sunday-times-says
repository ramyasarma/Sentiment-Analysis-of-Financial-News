             Clive Cowdery ’s Resolution Ltd.
plans to extract 800 million pounds ($1.2 billion) from Axa SA
assets that it’s buying, the  Sunday Times  said, without saying
where it got the information.  
 The excess capital has accumulated in life-insurance funds
run by the company, the newspaper reported, citing analysts it
didn’t identify. Resolution is buying most of Axa’s U.K.
business for 2.8 billion pounds, according to the Sunday Times.
