             The Czech Civic Democratic Party
elected  Petr Necas  as its chairman, confirming his position as
the leader of negotiations on forming the next government.  
 The Civic Democrats, TOP09 and Public Affairs are in talks
to create a Cabinet after winning a combined majority in
elections on May 28 and May 29. The parties want to have an
agreement by July 7 on a coalition government that will need to
cut the fiscal deficit in half by 2013 to meet European Union
request.  
 The result of the party vote “may help calm the atmosphere
at the coalition negotiations,” Necas told reporters in Prague
today. “I can understand that the partners at the talks may not
have been sure who would negotiate with them” in the future.  
 Necas, 45, was previously the Civic Democrats’ deputy
chairman. He became the party’s election leader after the former
chairman, ex-Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek, stepped down in
April. President Vaclav Klaus asked Necas on June 4 to try to
form a majority government.  
 All three parties in the government talks pledged to curb
the public finance deficit that widened to 5.9 percent of gross
domestic product last year, almost double the 3 percent limit
for joining the euro area, after the country fell into the worst
recession since the end of communism two decades ago.
