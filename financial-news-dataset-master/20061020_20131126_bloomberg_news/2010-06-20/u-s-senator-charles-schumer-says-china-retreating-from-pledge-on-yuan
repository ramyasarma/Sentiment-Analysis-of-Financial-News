             U.S. Senator  Charles Schumer  said
China is retreating from a pledge to end the yuan’s fixed rate
to the dollar and that he plans to advance trade-sanctions
legislation.  
 “Just a day after there was much hoopla about the Chinese
finally changing their policy, they are already backing off,”
Schumer, a New York Democrat, said today in an e-mailed
statement. “We intend to move forward as quickly as possible
with legislation.”  
 The People’s Bank of China indicated yesterday it’s
abandoning the 6.83 yuan peg to the dollar. The central bank
said while there’s no basis for “large scale” moves in the
currency, the exchange rate will be allowed increased
“flexibility.”  
 “It is only strong legislation that will get the Chinese
to change and will stop jobs and wealth from flowing out of
America as a result of unfair trade policies,” Schumer said.

                     June 21 (Bloomberg) -- Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about China's shift in currency policy, and its implications for the nation's economy and trade. 
     The People’s Bank of China two days ago indicated it’s abandoning the 6.83 yuan peg to the dollar adopted during the global crisis to shield exporters. The central bank said while there’s no basis for  “large scale” moves in the currency, the exchange rate will be allowed increased “flexibility.” (Source: Bloomberg)
