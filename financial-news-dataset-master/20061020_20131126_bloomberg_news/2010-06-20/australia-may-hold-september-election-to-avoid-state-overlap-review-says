             Australia may hold its next federal
election in mid-September with this week’s session of parliament
likely to be the last before the polls, the Australian Financial
Review reported, without saying where it
got the information. Holding the election before October may
avert an overlap with state polls in Victoria and New South
Wales state, the newspaper said.
