             United Internet AG  plans to sell a
new tablet computer in July to challenge Apple Inc.’s iPad,
 WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing unidentified people close to
Chief Executive Officer  Ralph Dommermuth .  
 The device will closely resemble the iPad but be
significantly cheaper, according to the report. United
Internet’s tablet computer will use Google Inc.’s Android
operating system and the company is developing an online store
for applications to rival Apple’s offering, the newspaper said.
