             A Hong Kong publisher has cancelled
plans to publish the diary of former Chinese Premier Li Peng
three days before the book was due to go on sale because of
copyright problems, the South China Morning Post reported today,
citing the company’s website. The original Chinese-language
version of the diary, which chronicles the period surrounding
the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, is available on the
Internet, the newspaper reported.
