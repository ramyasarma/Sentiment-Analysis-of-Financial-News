             Peter S. Lynch , the vice chairman of
Fidelity Management & Research, and his wife, Carolyn, are
donating $20 million to form a center at Boston College to
mentor new principals in the Boston area.  
 The Lynch Leadership Academy, to be funded by the Lynch
School of Education, will award 25 fellowships annually to
principals from Boston’s 135 public schools, 16 charter schools
and the 135 schools of the Archdiocese of Boston, Lynch said.  
 Principals will attend a leadership retreat, a two-week
institute, monthly workshops and weekly sessions with advisers.
The goal is to help create a network of colleagues for them to
exchange ideas, Lynch said in an interview.  
 “There’s no handbook for these people on how to be a
better principal,” Lynch said. “It’s a really tough job and
often you’re isolated.”  
 The couple was inspired partly by Carolyn’s father, who was
a principal,  Carolyn Lynch  said. Fellows will receive three
graduate school credits and a certificate in school leadership.  
 Lynch is a 1965 graduate of Boston College. The Lynches
gave $10 million to launch Boston College’s Lynch School in 1999.  
 Lynch, one of the nation’s best-known investors, managed
Fidelity’s Magellan Fund from May 1977 to May 1990. Assets under
management during that time grew to $14 billion from $22 million,
according to  Adam Banker , Fidelity spokesman.
