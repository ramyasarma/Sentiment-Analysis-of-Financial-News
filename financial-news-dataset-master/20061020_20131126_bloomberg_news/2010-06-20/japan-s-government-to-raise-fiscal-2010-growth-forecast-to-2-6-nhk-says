             Japan’s government will raise its
estimate for economic growth this fiscal year to 2.6 percent
from a December forecast of 1.4 percent because exports to Asia
have been strong and fiscal measures to aid purchases of cars
and electronics appliances supported consumption, public
broadcaster NHK said. The government will revise the forecast in
its forthcoming fiscal reform plan, the report said.
