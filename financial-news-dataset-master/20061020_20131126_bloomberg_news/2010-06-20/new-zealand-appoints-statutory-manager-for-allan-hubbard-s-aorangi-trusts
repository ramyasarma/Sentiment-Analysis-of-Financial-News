             New Zealand has appointed a
statutory manager for seven trusts and Aorangi Securities Ltd.,
which are associated with businessman  Allan Hubbard , to protect
investors and prevent fraud.  
 Hubbard and his wife are also subject to statutory
management because they are so closely connected with the
businesses, Commerce Minister  Simon Power  said in an e-mailed
 statement  yesterday. South Canterbury Finance Ltd., a non-bank
lender linked to Hubbard, is not affected.  
 “The main objectives are to prevent fraud and reckless
company management, to protect investors and to enable the
orderly administration of a company’s affairs,” Power said.  
 Regulators considered other remedies but chose statutory
management because of the circumstances, which include loans to
related parties not being property secured and documented, he
said. Some matters have been referred to the Serious Fraud
Office for potential breaches of the Crimes Act.
