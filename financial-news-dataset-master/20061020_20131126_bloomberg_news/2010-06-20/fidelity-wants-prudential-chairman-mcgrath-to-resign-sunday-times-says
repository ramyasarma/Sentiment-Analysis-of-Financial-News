             Fidelity Investments will demand
that Prudential Plc Chairman  Harvey McGrath  resign at a meeting
tomorrow, the  Sunday Times  reported, citing people close to the
situation it didn’t identify.  
 Some shareholders are sounding out potential replacements
including  Paul Myners , a former U.K. Treasury minister, and
 Naguib Kheraj , who was chief executive officer of JPMorgan
Cazenove, the newspaper said.  
 Prudential’s management is meeting with shareholders after
the company’s aborted bid to buy AIG’s AIA Group Ltd. for more
than $30 billion, the Sunday Times reported.  
 Prudential spokesman  Ed Brewster  declined to comment on the
report when reached today by telephone. “We are regularly
speaking to all our major shareholders,” he said.
