             Inflation in the United Arab
Emirates, the Arab world’s second-largest economy, accelerated
to 0.9 percent in May, the fastest in a year, as the cost of
food and education increased.  
 On the month, consumer prices were little changed at minus
0.07 percent, according to data  released  today on the U.A.E.
statistics office’s website. Inflation was at 0.8 percent in
April.  
 Inflation has accelerated for the last three months after
the U.A.E. faced deflation from falling real-estate prices and a
slowdown of global trade. Property prices in Dubai, the second-
biggest emirate in the U.A.E., fell by 50 percent from their
mid-2008 peak, according to Deutsche Bank AG estimates.  
 “The main drivers of inflation appear to be food costs and
education,”  Tim Fox , a Dubai-based economist at Emirates NBD
PJSC, said by e-mail. “The overall level of inflation is still
very low, and there are significant hindrances to rising
inflation going forward.”  
 The cost of food and soft drinks advanced an annual 1.2
percent while the price of education rose 0.7 percent, according
to the data. Housing costs fell by 0.5 percent.  
 The supply of housing, a strong dollar and tightness of
monetary policy will keep inflation fairly subdued, Fox said. He
is forecasting inflation of 1 percent this year, rising to 2.5
percent in 2011.  
 A weaker euro may damp inflationary pressures on the Gulf
Arab region as it will lower the cost of imports, according to
 Ann Wyman , the New York-based head of emerging markets Europe at
Nomura Holdings Inc.
