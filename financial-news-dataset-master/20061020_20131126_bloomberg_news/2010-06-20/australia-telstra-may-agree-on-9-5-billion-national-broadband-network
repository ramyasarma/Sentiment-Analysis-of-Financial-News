             Telstra Corp.  rose the most in nine
months in Sydney trading after Australia’s largest phone company
avoided state sanctions by surrendering the nationwide fixed-
line business to the government.  
 Telstra  climbed 3.4 percent to close at A$3.34 in Sydney,
the largest gain since Sept. 16, after surging as much as 7.1
percent. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 1.3 percent.  
 After nine months of talks, Telstra will receive about A$11
billion ($9.7 billion) in compensation to phase out its copper-
wire network and transfer customers to the government-backed  NBN
Co. ’s fiber-optic service. The agreement, subject to shareholder
approval, avoids penalties including a ban on Telstra acquiring
new airwaves for next-generation mobile services and the forced
sale of its pay-television holdings.  
 “It’s a lot less punitive than it could have been for
Telstra,” said  Mark McDonnell , an analyst at BBY Ltd. in Sydney,
who rates the stock “buy.” “If Telstra had been blocked from
acquiring spectrum, but their rivals could, the company could
have been at a long-term competitive disadvantage.”  
 Telstra will gradually shut down its copper-wire network as
customers are shifted to the A$43 billion NBN fiber project over
the next eight years while the government builds its network.  
 The non-binding agreement, announced by Prime Minister
 Kevin Rudd  yesterday, will also give NBN access to the ducts and
trenches that enable Telstra’s copper-wire network to operate.  
 Splitting Assets  
 Telstra had been in talks with the government since
September after Communications Minister  Stephen Conroy  called
for the company to split the businesses that sell to customers
from its fixed-line assets.  
 “For Telstra, this agreement means more certainty,” said
 David Kennedy , research director at telecommunications
consultant Ovum. “It provides a clear pathway to migrate its
business to a next generation fiber environment, and locks in
the value of its customer base and physical assets.”  
 Chairman  Catherine Livingstone  yesterday said Telstra needs
to forge a “definitive agreement” with the government before
putting it to the company’s 1.4 million direct shareholders in
the first half of calendar 2011. The deal also needs new laws to
be passed and approval from the nation’s antitrust regulator.  
 With the only national network, rivals such as  Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. ’s Optus unit paid Telstra fees to sell
some voice and Internet services.  
 NBN will be a wholesale service, selling connections to
Internet service providers such as the retail operations of
Telstra and Optus, who in turn sell to customers.
