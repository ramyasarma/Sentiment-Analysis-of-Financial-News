             About a third of the candidates in
Japan’s upper house election next month say the nation’s sales
tax should be doubled to 10 percent to help contain public debt,
according to a survey by Kyodo News. Some 60 percent say the
government should cap bond sales in the next fiscal year, Kyodo
reported.
