             Australian stock futures rose, while
Japanese futures were set to be little changed. Futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed after China signaled an end
to the yuan’s fixed rate to the dollar.  
 Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
expiring in September were bid in the pre-market at 10,000 as of
8:02 a.m. in Osaka, Japan. The Nikkei 225 closed at 9,995.02 on
June 18. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.1
percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.8 percent.  
 Futures on the S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent today after the
People’s Bank of China said on June 19 that the exchange rate
will be allowed increased “flexibility” since the recovery of
the nation’s economy has become more “solid.”  
 “A rise in the yuan will help curb inflation in China,
which is likely to reduce concern over tighter fiscal
policies,” said  Norikazu Kitta , a strategist at Tokyo-based
Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  
 Last week, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 3.3 percent,
its biggest weekly advance since December, as reports showed
sentiment among American consumers improved and New York
manufacturing grew. Shares in the gauge trade at 14.6 times
 estimated earnings , compared with 20.1 times at the beginning of
this year.  
 In New York, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent on June 18.
American depositary receipts of BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
largest mining company, finished 1.4 percent lower than the
Sydney close on June 18 after metal prices dropped in London.  
 Mizuho, Telstra  
 ADRs of  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s third-biggest
bank by market value, jumped 1.5 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo after Credit Suisse Group AG raised its rating on
the stock to “outperform” from “neutral.”  
 The London Metal Exchange Index, which includes zinc and
copper, slid 0.7 percent on June 18.  
 Telstra Corp., Australia’s largest telephone provider,
soared 9.2 percent in New Zealand today after Australian
government-owned NBN Co. struck an A$11 billion ($9.7 billion)
deal with the phone company, removing an obstacle to the
creation of a national broadband network.  
 Japan’s government will raise its estimate for economic
growth this fiscal year to 2.6 percent from a December forecast
of 1.4 percent because exports to Asia have been strong, public
broadcaster NHK said. The government will revise the forecast in
its forthcoming fiscal reform plan, the report said.
