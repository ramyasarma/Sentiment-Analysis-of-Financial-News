             South African police said they
arrested a 32-year-old man for trespassing after he got into the
change room of the England soccer team following their goalless
World Cup draw against Algeria.  
 The man will appear in court later today following his
arrest at a hotel in Cape Town, the South African Police Service
said in an e-mailed statement today without identifying the man.
The police used CCTV footage to identify him.  
 Security has been stepped up within the inner perimeter of
stadiums being used for the World Cup soccer tournament to avoid
a repeat of the incident, police said.
