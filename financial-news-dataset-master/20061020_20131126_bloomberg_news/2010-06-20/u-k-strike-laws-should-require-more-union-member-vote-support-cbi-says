             The U.K. government should make it
harder for labor unions to call strikes, to prevent walkouts
based on support from a relatively small proportion of their
members, the Confederation of British Industry said.  
 The government should change the law so a strike can only
go ahead if at least 40 percent of the workforce eligible to
vote on action supports it, as well as a majority of those
casting their vote, the CBI said in an e-mailed report today.
Presently, only a majority of those taking part in a ballot is
required for it to succeed.  
 The proposed changes would have avoided some of the largest
strikes in the last year, including a two-day walkout by some
London Underground workers in June 2009 and another involving
public-sector workers in March this year, the CBI said. The call
comes as Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s coalition government
plans to unveil the deepest spending cuts in a generation in an
emergency budget tomorrow.  
 Even though many strikes were avoided during the U.K.’s
recession as companies reduced salaries rather than cutting
jobs, government employers may not be able to replicate that
result, CBI Deputy Director-General  John Cridland  said.  
 “The public-sector industrial-relations culture is
different,” Cridland told journalists in a June 18 press
briefing in London. “It appears to be more antagonistic.
There’s a much earlier tendency to draw the gun and fire it.”
