             Greece won’t restructure its debt,
and December tranches of international loans are secure provided
the nation keeps implementing its stability plan, Finance
Minister  George Papaconstantinou  told the Proto Thema  newspaper.   
 Greece “battled to avoid and avoided” restructuring its
debt with the help of the 110 billion-euro ($136.3 billion)
European Union and International Monetary Fund loan package, the
newspaper cited Papaconstantinou as saying in an interview
published today.  
 “There is no such scenario” where Greece would exit the
euro region and re-adopt the drachma, Papaconstantinou said. No
country is examining leaving the currency union, he added.  
 Papaconstantinou said structural changes being pushed
through to bolster competitiveness and price controls will help
contain inflation, and prices may eventually start to drop. A
debt restructuring would be “catastrophic” as Greece still has
major borrowing needs and must maintain investors’ trust,
Papaconstantinou said.
