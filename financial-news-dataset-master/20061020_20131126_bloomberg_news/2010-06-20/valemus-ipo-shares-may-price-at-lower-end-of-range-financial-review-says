             Valemus Ltd., the Australian
construction unit of Bilfinger Berger AG, may sell shares in its
initial public offering at the lower end of the A$2.20 to A$2.50
price range, the Australian Financial Review said.
Investors have been “lukewarm” after a roadshow to promote the
share sale, the newspaper reported, without saying where it got
the information.
