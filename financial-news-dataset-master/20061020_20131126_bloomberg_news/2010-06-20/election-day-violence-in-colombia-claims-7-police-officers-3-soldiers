             Seven Colombian police officers and
three soldiers were killed in separate incidents amid the
country’s presidential runoff election, the country’s Ministry
of Defense said.  
 The police were killed in a minefield laid by guerrillas of
the National Liberation Army, or ELN, as they patrolled a rural
area in Norte de Santander province about 5 miles (8 kilometers)
from the border with Venezuela, Carolina Ramirez of the
ministry’s press office said.  
 The soldiers died in a firefight with Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, guerrillas in Meta province,
Ramirez added.  
 Colombians are choosing between former Defense Minister
 Juan Manuel Santos  of the La U Party, and Green Party candidate
 Antanas Mockus , a former mayor of Bogota, in the second round of
voting.  
 Santos was favored by about 67 percent of those surveyed in
a Gallup Colombia poll taken June 5 to June 7, compared with
about 27 percent for Mockus. The next president will take over
Aug. 7 from President  Alvaro Uribe , who’s been in office since
2002 and is barred from seeking a third term.
