             The Australian and New Zealand
dollars rose to the highest in more than a month after China
signaled an end to the yuan’s fixed rate, boosting demand for
nations that sell products to the world’s third-largest economy.  
 The People’s Bank of China said while there’s no basis for
“large scale” moves in the nation’s currency, the exchange
rate will be allowed increased “flexibility.” The central bank
signaled two days ago it’s abandoning the 6.83 yuan peg to the
dollar adopted during the global crisis to shield exporters.  
 “The stronger yuan should be a boost to countries that are
heavily exporting to China or countries that are experiencing
growth in their China exports,” said  Mike Jones , a strategist
at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in Wellington, New Zealand. “Those
countries include New Zealand. Australia’s commodity-rich export
sector should benefit from the increased purchasing power of
Chinese manufacturers.”  
 Australia’s currency climbed as much as 1.6 percent to
touch 88.59 U.S. cents, the highest level since May 17, before
trading at 88.22 cents at 11:32 a.m. in New York, up 1.2
percent. It closed at 87.20 cents on June 18. The Aussie
appreciated 1.7 percent to 80.42 yen.  
 New Zealand’s dollar appreciated 0.9 percent to 71.29 U.S.
cents, from 70.69 cents last week, after touching 71.53 cents,
the strongest since May 14. It gained 1.4 percent to 64.99 yen.  
 “The decision by China will strengthen the purchasing
power of its government and Chinese companies,” said  Daisaku Ueno , Tokyo-based president of Gaitame.Com Research Institute
Ltd., a unit of Japan’s largest currency margin company. “Thus
the move will support resource-exporting countries such as
Australia.”
