             Sal. Oppenheim Jr. & Cie., the
wealth manager acquired by Deutsche Bank AG, forecast a return
to profit “in two to three years” after posting a net loss of
1.2 billion euros ($1.49 billion) last year,  WirtschaftsWoche 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The 2009 loss resulted from writedowns on loans, real
estate and stakes in other companies, according to the report.
