             The housing market began to retrench
in May after a government incentive ended, leaving manufacturing
at the head of the U.S. recovery, economists said reports this
week will show.  
 Sales of  new homes  fell 19 percent to a 410,000 annual pace
last month, according to the median estimate of 57 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before a Commerce Department report
June 23. Orders for  durable goods  may show gains in business
investment and overseas sales boosted demand for  capital
equipment  like computers and machinery.  
 “We got the run-up in housing activity and there’ll be a
pretty big payback now that the tax credit has expired,” said
 Stephen Stanley , chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in
Stamford, Connecticut. “The strongest sector of the economy
right now is manufacturing.”  
 Federal Reserve policy makers meeting this week are
projected to commit to keeping interest rates near zero in
coming months to help wean the world’s largest economy off
government stimulus. The hazard posed by the European debt
crisis, joblessness and a lack of inflation add to the reasons
why central bankers will focus on sustaining the economic
rebound.  
 “There are certainly a lot of risks the Fed is mindful of,
and they’re very much in a wait-and-see mode,” said Stanley.
Central bankers begin their two-day policy meeting on June 22.  
 Homebuyers needed to have signed their contracts by April
30 and must close deals by the end of June to qualify for a
government credit worth as much as $8,000. Sales of new houses
are tabulated at contract signings, meaning the window of
opportunity for that market has shut.  
 Fewer Orders  
 Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. , the largest homebuilder in New
Jersey, reported this month that orders fell 17 percent in the
quarter ended April 30 from the same time last year, and
contract signings slowed in May, a sign the tax credit helped
pull some sales forward.  
 “The expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit, the
lack of job growth and a potential increase in foreclosures all
pose risks to a housing industry recovery,”  Ara K. Hovnanian ,
chairman and chief executive officer, said in the statement on
June 2.  
 Resales, in contrast, have a couple more months to run.
Purchases of  existing homes , which are calculated based on
closings, rose 6.5 percent in May to a six-month high 6.15
million annual pace, according to the median estimate of 57
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The report from the National
Association of Realtors is due June 22.  
 Aircraft Orders  
 Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years fell
in May for the first time in six months, according to the survey
median. The projected 1.3 percent drop reflects a likely retreat
in demand for transportation equipment, a volatile category.
Orders for civilian aircraft probably fell after jumping 228
percent in April.  
 Orders  excluding transportation  increased 1 percent, the
third gain in the past four months, the Commerce Department’s
June 24 report on durable goods is also projected to show.  
 Growing  exports  and business spending are helping drive the
rebound in demand at American factories. Sales overseas were up
22 percent through April from the same time last year, according
to figures from the Commerce Department. Investment in  equipment
and software  climbed 13 percent in the first quarter after
increasing 19 percent in the prior three months, the best six-
month performance since 2000.  
 Growing Economy  
 The economy began to recover in the middle of last year
following the worst recession since the 1930s. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast gross domestic product rose at an
annual rate of 3 percent in the first quarter, matching the
government’s prior estimate published last month. The Commerce
Department will issue the report on June 25.  
 Stocks have fallen on concern the global economic rebound
may cool as European governments try to reduce budget deficits.
The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  is down 8.2 percent from a 19-
month high reached on April 23.  
 The slump in stock prices is having limited effect on
Americans’ confidence, a report will show on June 25. The
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of consumer
 sentiment  rose to 75.5 this month, the highest level since
January 2008, from 73.6 in May, according to the survey median.
The reading would match the preliminary estimate issued earlier
this month.

                          June 16 (Bloomberg) -- Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital Inc., talks with Bloomberg's Mark Crumpton about U.S. manufacturing and housing data for April, and the outlook for the economy and Federal Reserve monetary policy.
     Production in the U.S. rose by the most since August and builders broke ground on fewer homes than projected, showing manufacturing is sustaining the recovery as the housing market retreats following the expiration of a government tax credit.
