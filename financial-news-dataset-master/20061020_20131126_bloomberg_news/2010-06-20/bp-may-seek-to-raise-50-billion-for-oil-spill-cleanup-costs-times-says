             BP Plc is seeking to raise $50
billion to cover the cost of the oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico, the Sunday Times said, without saying where it got the
information.  
 The first $10 billion may come from a bond sale this week
and the company is talking to banks to get a $20 billion loan,
the newspaper said. The remaining $20 billion would come from
asset sales over two years, the paper said.  
 BP wants to move quickly to raise cash because of concern
its ratings may be downgraded, boosting its borrowing costs, the
paper said.  
 “We need to have an unusually strong cash position,”
Andrew Gowers, head of communications of London-based BP, said
when contacted by phone today. He declined to provide more
details.
