             Groupe Eurotunnel SA, Macquarie
Group Ltd. and Network Rail Ltd. may bid for the U.K.’s High
Speed One rail link, the Observer reported, without saying where
it got the information.  
 The government will begin the sale of the 1.5 billion-pound
($2.2 billion) rail network that connects London to the Channel
Tunnel, including the St. Pancras International terminal,
tomorrow, the newspaper said.
