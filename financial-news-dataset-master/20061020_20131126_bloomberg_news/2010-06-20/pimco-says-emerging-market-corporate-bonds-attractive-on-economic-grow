             Infrastructure-related corporate
bonds in emerging markets are attractive with domestic demand
in those nations poised to outpace growth in the developed
world, according to  Pacific Investment Management Co.   
 Markets and ratings agencies haven’t caught up to
improving fundamentals, with emerging market corporate bonds
yielding an average 6 percent, 100 basis points more than
comparably rated debt in developed markets,  Brigitte Posch , an
executive vice president at Pimco, wrote in a commentary on the
fund’s website.  
 “Nations serious about stimulating consumption will need
to spend liberally on infrastructure,” Posch wrote. “We have
seen increasing opportunities in bonds issued by state-owned
entities, which are quasi-sovereigns.”  
 Newport Beach, California-based Pimco runs the $227.9
billion  Total Return Fund , the world’s biggest bond fund.
