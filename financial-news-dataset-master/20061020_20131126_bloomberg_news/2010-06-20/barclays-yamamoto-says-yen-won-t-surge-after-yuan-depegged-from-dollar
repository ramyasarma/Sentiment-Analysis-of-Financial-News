             Masafumi Yamamoto , chief currency
strategist at Barclays Plc in Tokyo, comments on the impact on
the yen of China’s announcement that it will allow more currency
flexibility. The statement signals an end to the yuan’s two-
year-old peg to the dollar a week before a Group of 20 summit.  
 “The timing of the announcement was apparently intended to
give enough time for market participants to digest the impact
over the weekend and stop them from reacting in a panicky,
Pavlov’s dog manner. It will also defuse heated debates about
the Chinese currency ahead of a G-20 summit meeting.  
 “The yuan is expected to strengthen only at a gradual pace,
and the announcement won’t likely trigger a big jump in the
yen’s value. Even if the yen advances, Prime Minister Naoto
Kan’s government will probably move to curb the Japanese
currency’s appreciation.”  
 “Concern that the statement will trigger a sudden jump in
ht eyen and stall Japan’s export-oriented recovery is small. On
a current account basis, trade between China and Japan is almost
in balance.”
