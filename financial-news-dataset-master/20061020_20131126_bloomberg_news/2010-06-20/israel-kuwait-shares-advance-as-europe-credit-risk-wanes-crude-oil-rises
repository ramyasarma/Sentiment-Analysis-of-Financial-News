             Israel and Kuwait shares led Middle
East markets higher as Europe’s efforts to contain its debt
crisis bolstered confidence about a recovery in the global
economy. Crude oil gains boosted the appeal of Gulf shares.  
 Israel’s Elbit Systems Ltd. advanced the most since June 8
after it received a contract to supply electronic systems worth
about $130 million to an unidentified army in Latin America.
 Mobile Telecommunications Co.,  the Kuwaiti phone company known
as Zain, rose 3.7 percent after Al-Qabas newspaper reported that
it repaid about $4 billion of loans. The  TA-25 Index  increased
0.6 percent to 1,113.53, the highest intraday level since
June 17, as of 10:25 a.m. in Tel Aviv. Kuwait’s  gauge  rose 0.5
percent to 6,618.9, the highest in almost a week.  
 “We’re firmer in the region as the international backdrop
is decent,” said  Ali Khan , head of cash-equity trading at
Dubai-based Arqaam Capital Ltd. “Oil is moving toward the top
of its trading range.”  
 European  stocks rose for a fourth week as concern about the
region’s sovereign debt crisis waned. European Union leaders
agreed on June 17 to disclose how banks perform on stress tests,
seeking to show investors that the financial system can
withstand shocks.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index  gained 2.4 percent
last week, the longest stretch of weekly gains since April.  
 U.S. stocks rose last week, capping the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index ’s biggest two-week rally since November, after New
York-area manufacturing expanded. China said yesterday it will
allow a more flexible yuan, signaling an end to the currency’s
two-year-old peg to the dollar a week before a Group of 20
summit.  
 Crude Oil  
 Crude oil rose above $77 a barrel last week.  Oil for July
delivery gained 39 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $77.18 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on June 18. The price
has risen 8.1 percent in the past year. Oil increased 4.6
percent last week, the most in three weeks. The six nations of
the Gulf Cooperation Council, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  
 Zain rose 3.7 percent to 1,120 fils. Al-Qabas reported
today that the company used proceeds from the sale of its
African assets to India’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. to repay loans to
50 local and overseas lenders. Elbit, Israel’s largest non-
government defense contractor, gained 1.8 percent to 195.90
shekels.  
 Qatar’s  QE Index  gained 0.4 percent to 7,035.29. The Qatar
Investment Authority, the Doha-based sovereign wealth fund,
agreed to invest $2.8 billion in Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd.’s initial public offering, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter. The $58 billion fund signed an
agreement with Agricultura Bank on June 17, the people said,
declining to be identified because the deal is private.  
 Dubai’s  DFM General Index  dropped 0.3 percent. Oman’s  index 
was little changed, Bahrain’s  gauge  retreated 0.2 percent and
Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  increased less than 0.1 percent.  
 Israeli government bonds were little changed with the
benchmark Mimshal Shiklit due February 2019 rising 0.03 shekel
to 112.33. The yield was at 4.52 percent. The shekel declined
0.2 percent to 3.8307 against the dollar on June 18.
