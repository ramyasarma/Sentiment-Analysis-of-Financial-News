             Dubai’s benchmark stock index rose
the most in 10 weeks and Egyptian shares gained, leading a rally
in Middle East markets on growing confidence that Europe will
contain its debt crisis. Oil gains boosted Gulf shares.  
 The  DFM General Index  jumped 3.1 percent, the most since
April 11, to 1,547.13, led by  Emaar Properties PJSC , the biggest
stock in the gauge. The builder of the world’s tallest
skyscraper surged 8.6 percent after selling its Hamptons
International unit to Countrywide Plc. Egypt’s  EGX 30 Index 
increased 1.6 percent to 6,519.09 as  Telecom Egypt , the largest
fixed-line telephone company in the region, gained 2.2 percent.
The TA-25 Index of Israeli equities advanced 1.8 percent.  
 Sentiment improved after European Union leaders agreed on
June 17 to disclose how banks perform on stress tests to show
investors that the financial system can withstand shocks.  The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index  gained for a fourth week, the longest
stretch of weekly gains since April. Crude oil rose to $77.18 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on June 18 for a
weekly gain of 4.6 percent. The six nations of the Gulf
Cooperation Council supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  
 “We’re firmer in the region as the international backdrop
is decent,” said  Ali Khan , head of cash-equity trading at
Dubai-based Arqaam Capital Ltd. “Oil is moving toward the top
of its trading range.”  
 Global stocks advanced for a second straight week, with the
 MSCI World Index  of developed nations rising 3.2 percent and the
MSCI Emerging Markets measure advancing 4 percent. The  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  had its biggest two-week rally since
November, after New York-area manufacturing expanded.  
 Flexible Yuan  
 The euro strengthened for a second straight week against
the dollar, climbing 2.3 percent to $1.2388. China said
yesterday it will allow more flexibility in the yuan, signaling
an end to the currency’s two-year-old peg to the dollar a week
before a Group of 20 summit.  
 Emaar soared the most since March 25 to 3.30 dirhams after
declining 1.3 percent earlier in the session. Countrywide, a
U.K. realtor and property services company, will own the rights
to operate Hamptons’s business in the U.K., Europe and Asia,
Emaar said on June 17. The Dubai company will operate Hamptons
in the Middle East and North Africa.  
 “As soon as some significant bids were seen on large-cap
names, the retail buyers saw this as a signal to re-enter the
market,” said  Julian Bruce , director of equity sales at EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE. “Due to low volumes overall the upside move
has been exaggerated.”  
 Constrained Volume  
 A total of 179 million shares traded on the Dubai exchange,
compared with the six-month daily average of 200 million.  
 Telecom Egypt rose to 17.31 Egyptian pounds, the highest
this month after the company said it will pay a dividend of 55
piasters a share on June 30.  
 Qatar’s  QE Index  gained 0.6 percent to the highest in a
month. The Qatar Investment Authority, the Doha-based sovereign
wealth fund, agreed to invest $2.8 billion in Agricultural Bank
of China Ltd.’s initial public offering, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter. The $58 billion fund signed an
agreement with Agricultural Bank on June 17, the people said,
declining to be identified because the deal is private.  
 The  TA-25  gains were led by Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication
Corp.’s 3.2 percent advance. Kuwait’s  gauge  rose 0.9 percent,
the most in almost two weeks. Oman’s  index  advanced 0.4 percent,
while  Bahrain’s  closed little changed at 1,392.48. Abu Dhabi’s
 ADX General Index  rose 0.8 percent. Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All
Share Index rose 1.1 percent to the highest in more than a
month.  
 Israeli government bonds were little changed with the
benchmark Mimshal Shiklit due February 2019 rising 0.09 shekel
to 112.39. The yield dropped one basis point to 4.51 percent.
The shekel declined 0.2 percent to 3.8307 against the dollar on
June 18.
