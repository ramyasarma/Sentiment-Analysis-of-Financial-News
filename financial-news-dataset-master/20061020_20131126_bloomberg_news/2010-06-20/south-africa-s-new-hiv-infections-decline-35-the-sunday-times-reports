             New HIV infections in South Africa 
dropped by 35 percent between 2002 and 2008, the Sunday Times 
said, citing a study.  
 There was a 60 percent decline in infections among people 
aged 15 to 24, indicating that the country’s prevention 
campaigns, promotion of condom use and HIV tests were helping, 
the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing the study, 
entitled SA National HIV Prevalence, Incidence, Behavior and 
Communications Survey: A Turning Tide Among Teenagers?
