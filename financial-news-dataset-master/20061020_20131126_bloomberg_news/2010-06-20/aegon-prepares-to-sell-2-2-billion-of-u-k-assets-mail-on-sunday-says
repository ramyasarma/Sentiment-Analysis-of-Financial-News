             Aegon NV  is preparing to sell its
British life and pension insurance business, including Scottish
Equitable, for 1.5 billion pounds ($2.2 billion), the Mail on
Sunday reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 Aegon will provide an update on plans to leave the British
market at an analyst meeting in two days, the newspaper said,
citing a company spokeswoman it didn’t name.  
 Aegon doesn’t comment on rumors in the market,  Dick Schiethart , a The Hague-based company spokesman, said in an
interview today.
