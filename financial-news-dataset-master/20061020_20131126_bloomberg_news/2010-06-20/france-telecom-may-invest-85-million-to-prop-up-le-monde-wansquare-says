             France Telecom SA  may invest as much
as 60 million euros ($85 million) to prop up French newspaper Le
Monde, website  Wansquare  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  
 France Telecom may inject 18 million euros directly into Le
Monde and spend 42 million euros to buy a stake held by
Lagardere SCA, Wansquare said. Lagardere last week confirmed
that France Telecom had approached it about selling its Le Monde
holding.  
 Le Monde is seeking outside investors to pump fresh cash
into the money-losing afternoon daily.
