             Vale SA , the world’s fourth-largest
nickel producer, and striking workers in Sudbury, Ontario,
resumed labor talks yesterday, a company spokesman said today.  
 “Talks are ongoing,”  Cory McPhee  said in a phone
interview from Toronto. Workers represented by the United
Steelworkers at Vale operations in Sudbury have been on strike
since July 13.  
 Wayne Fraser , a USW spokesman and director, wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  
 Mediator Kevin Burnett has said “progress was made” in
negotiations that took place June 4-7.  
 OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , Jinchuan Group Ltd. and BHP
Billiton Ltd. were the world’s biggest producers of refined
nickel in 2009.
