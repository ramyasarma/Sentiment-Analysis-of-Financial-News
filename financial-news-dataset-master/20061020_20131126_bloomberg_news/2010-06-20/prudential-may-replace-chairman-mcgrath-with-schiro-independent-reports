             James Schiro , former chief executive
officer of Zurich Financial Services AG, is a candidate for the
chairmanship of Prudential Plc, the Independent on Sunday  said ,
citing unidentified people familiar with the situation.  
 Attention has shifted to Chairman  Harvey McGrath  from Chief
Executive  Tidjane Thiam  after an investor rebellion forced the
company to abandon a bid to buy the Asian business of American
Insurance Group Inc., the newspaper said. While McGrath is on
his way out, his replacement by Schiro is far from certain, the
Independent reported.  
 Prudential spokesman  Ed Brewster  declined to comment on the
report when reached today by phone.
