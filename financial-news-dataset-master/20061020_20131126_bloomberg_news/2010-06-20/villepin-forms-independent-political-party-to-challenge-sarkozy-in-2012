             Former French Prime Minister
 Dominique de Villepin  has created a new political movement
called United Republic to challenge President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in
the 2012 presidential election.  
 In an hour-long speech last night to 3,000 supporters in a
Paris theater, Villepin criticized Sarkozy for encouraging anti-
immigrant sentiments and for following the U.S.’s military
strategy in Afghanistan, where the 44th French soldier was
killed yesterday.  
 Villepin was a member of Sarkozy’s Union for a Popular
Movement. The two men fell out over who would represent the
party in the 2007 election, an internal struggle won by Sarkozy.
In January, Villepin was cleared by a Paris court of failing to
prevent a smear campaign against Sarkozy.  
 Villepin, 56, was foreign minister under former President
Jacques Chirac in 2001. He led France’s opposition to the U.S.
invasion of Iraq.
