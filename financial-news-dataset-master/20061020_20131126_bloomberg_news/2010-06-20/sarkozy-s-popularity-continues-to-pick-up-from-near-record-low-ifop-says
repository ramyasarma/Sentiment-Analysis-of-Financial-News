             French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
popularity continues to pick up from a record low, according to
a poll for Le Journal de Dimanche newspaper.  
 Sarkozy’s approval rating gained 1 point in June to 34
percent, according to an  Ifop  poll released today. His
popularity reached a record low of 30 percent in March.  
 Sixty-six percent of respondents said they disagreed with
his policies in June, unchanged from May and down from 68
percent in April, Ifop said.  
 Prime Minister  Francois Fillon ’s approval rating remained
steady at 50 percent for the second straight month, Ifop said.  
 Ifop telephoned 1,846 adults from June 10 to June 18. It
didn’t give a margin of error.
