             BP Plc  will seek to cut costs by $14
billion in six months to sustain profitability as it struggles
to stem the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the Observer  reported ,
citing unidentified people in London’s financial district.  
 The company plans to sell its interests in the North Sea,
as well as stakes in projects in which it doesn’t exercise
overall control, the newspaper said. While directors will also
look at selling the company’s 1.4 percent stake in OAO Rosneft,
Russia’s largest oil producer, there’s no question of it selling
its half-owned TNK-BP venture, said the newspaper, which gave no
additional details about other ways BP may cut costs.
