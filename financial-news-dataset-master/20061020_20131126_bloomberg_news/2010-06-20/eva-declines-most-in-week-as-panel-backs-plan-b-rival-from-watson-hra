             Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. 
declined the most in more than a week after competitors won a
U.S. panel’s backing for the contraceptive ulipristal, a rival
to the Plan B morning-after pill sold by  Teva .  
 The  shares  of the world’s largest generic drugmaker
decreased as much as 1.9 percent, the  most  since June 9, to 202
shekels. The stock retreated 1.5 percent to 202.9 shekels at
10:27 a.m. in Tel Aviv.  
 Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.  and HRA Pharma’s drug, which
would be sold under the name Ella, is safe and effective,
outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration said on
June 17 in two 11-0 votes in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  
 Ulipristal is designed to prevent pregnancy when taken
within five days of unprotected sex, two days longer than Plan
B. The drug has been sold in 22 European countries since
October.  
 If approved in the U.S., ulipristal would be available by
prescription only. Plan B, known as the morning-after pill, can
be sold without a prescription to women 17 years old and older,
and by prescription for younger females.
