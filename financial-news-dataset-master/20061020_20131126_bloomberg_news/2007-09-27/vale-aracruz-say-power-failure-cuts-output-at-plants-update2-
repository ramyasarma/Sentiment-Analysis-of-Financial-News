             Cia. Vale to Rio Doce , the world's
largest iron-ore producer, and pulp maker Aracruz Celulose SA
said a  power failure  halted output at plants in  Brazil 's Espirito
Santo state.  
 Seven Vale pellet plants were shut late yesterday, cutting
production by about 100,000 metric tons, Rio de Janeiro-based
Vale said today in a statement. Vale was also forced to halt
operations at the Port of Tubarao for three hours. Aracruz said
in a separate statement that two of its three pulp mills in the
area were shut, reducing pulp output by 4,000 tons a day.  
 A short circuit on a transmission line in the north of Rio
de Janeiro state, which neighbors Espirito Santo, caused the
 power outage , according to Furnas, a state-controlled power-
generation company. Full power was restored at 3:43 p.m. local
time, and the utility is investigating the cause of the short
circuit, Furnas said in an e-mailed statement.  
 Vale exports about half its  iron-ore  and imports coal
through Tubarao in a suburb of Vitoria, the capital of Espirito
Santo. Most of Vale's pellets, a concentrated form of iron ore
used to make fine grains of the mineral for blast furnaces, are
produced in the state.  
 Vale restarted port operations after receiving electricity
through an alternate line. Vale said two of its seven pellet
plants have also been restarted.  
 Aracruz, Brazil's largest cellulose pulp exporter, expects
to reach full production at its two factories tomorrow. A third
plant in the complex had been closed for maintenance.
