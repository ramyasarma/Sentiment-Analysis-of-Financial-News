             Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (009540) , the
world's largest shipbuilder, led declines among shipbuilders in
 South Korea  and  Singapore  on concern rising steel costs will slow
earnings growth.  
 Hyundai Heavy  fell 5.6 percent, the biggest drop in more
than a month, to close at 355,000 won in  Seoul .  Cosco Corp.
Singapore Ltd. (COS) , the shipbuilding unit of  China 's largest shipping
company, slipped 6.7 percent to S$3.08 in Singapore.  
 ``Investors are worried shipbuilders may report slower
earnings growth from the second quarter as higher material costs
are fully reflected,'' said Feynman Jeon, an analyst at Daishin
Securities Co. in Seoul. He rates Hyundai Heavy a ``buy.''  
 Steelmakers, including  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  and  Posco (005490) , are
raising prices as they pay as much as 71 percent more for  iron
ore  and other key ingredients. Hot-rolled steel in China, an
Asian benchmark, rose 9.7 percent this year, according to data
on Metal Bulletin.  
 Hyundai Heavy yesterday said operating profit, or sales
minus the cost of goods sold and administrative expenses, rose 59
percent to a record of 639.6 billion won ($639 million) in the
first quarter as it built more vessels at higher prices. That
exceeded a median estimate of 563 billion won in a
Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  
 Dongkuk Steel Mill Co. (001230) , which provides a third of South
Korea's demand for steel used in vessels, raised prices for the
second time this year, to the highest in the country. Starting
April 25, customers would have to pay 23 percent more at 1.01
million won a ton. Posco,  Asia 's third-largest steelmaker,
increased prices by 18 percent to 785,000 won starting April 17.  
 Nippon Steel, the world's second-largest maker of the alloy,
will raise wholesale prices for steel plates by 10 percent from
June. The company last increased prices on April 1.  
 Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co. (010620) , a unit of Hyundai Heavy and the
world's fourth-largest shipyard, fell 4.9 percent to 222,500 won
in Seoul.  Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings Ltd. (YZJSGD) , the first
Chinese shipbuilder to trade shares in Singapore, dropped 3.6
percent to S$1.06 in the island city.
