Brazilian health officials say a
suspected case of  Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease , a fatal illness
that destroys brain tissue, probably wasn’t caused by eating
beef of an animal infected with the mad cow sickness.  "The occurrence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob from beef consumption
is highly unlikely," Jose Saraiva, health secretary for the city
of Campinas, which was notified of the case on Nov. 12, told
reporters today. "This possibility has almost been ruled out."  Health officials in Campinas, in Sao Paulo state, said
yesterday they were investigating a possible case of  variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob , which would be the first ever in Brazil. The
variant of the incurable human illness has been linked to eating
meat from animals infected with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, known as BSE or mad cow. Brazil is the world’s
largest beef exporter.  JBS SA, the world’s largest meat-processing company, said
Brazil has never had a case of mad cow.  “Brazilian beef is healthy,” the Sao Paulo-based company
said today in a statement. “It’s important to remember this is
an initial diagnosis and cannot be confirmed.”  Campinas’s health department will have a definitive
diagnosis in 15 days, Saraiva said.  At least 139 people worldwide have died from variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob, according to the World Health Organization’s
website. Most of the deaths were in the U.K.  Brazil’s beef exports totaled $4.12 billion in 2009,
according to the Ministry’s of Agriculture website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
