Madagascar’s attempted coup is
unlikely to have a major impact on plans to start production of
nickel from the $4.65 billion Ambatovy mine in the first half of
2011, Korea Resources Corp. said.  The state-run minerals explorer is closely watching
developments, the Seoul-based company, which is part of a group
that holds 27.5 percent of the project, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Madagascar’s army is trying to persuade about 20 rebel
officers to turn themselves in after their attempt to overthrow
President  Andry Rajoelina  failed on Nov. 17. The dissident
officers are at an army base near the international airport,
north of Antananarivo, the capital. Even if the airport is
closed, it won’t affect ongoing work on the project since most
of construction materials are delivered by ship, Korea Resources
said.  Nickel rose for a third day, gaining $225, or 1 percent, to
$22,075 a ton by 11:15 a.m. on the London Metals Exchange.  Canada’s  Sherritt International Corp.  has a 40 percent
stake in the Ambatovy project on the Indian Ocean island nation,
while a Korean group, led by Korea Resources and  Daewoo
International Corp ., and  Sumitomo Corp. , Japan’s third-largest
trading company, each hold 27.5 percent.  At the moment, there’s no impact on the development plan,
Koji Furui, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Sumitomo, said today by
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
