Thai opposition protesters plan to
gather 10,000 people in central Bangkok tonight to mark the six-
month anniversary of a military crackdown ending demonstrations
earlier this year, protest leader Sombat Boonngarm-anong said.  The protest will only last a few hours as the red-shirted
group aligned with former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra
focuses on an election that must be called next year, he said by
phone today. Demonstrations earlier this year lasted for more
than two months and killed at least 89 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
