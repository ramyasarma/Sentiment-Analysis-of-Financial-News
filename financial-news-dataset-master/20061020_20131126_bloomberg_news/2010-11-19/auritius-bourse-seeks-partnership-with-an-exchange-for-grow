The Stock Exchange of Mauritius
wants to partner with a foreign bourse for expansion and to
increase investor numbers, Chief Executive Officer  Sunil Benimadhu  said.  “We would expect such a partnership to create the space
for the trading of new products on the SEM, to increase the
number of investors trading on our market and to attract more
participants to our market.” Benimadhu said in an e-mailed
response to questions today from Port Louis, the capital.
“There is a general consensus that it is an initiative that may
be worth pursuing, provided we identify a partner that shares
our vision of SEM’s future.”  The exchange is sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth biggest by
market value after South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya. The
benchmark  SEMDEX Index  reached the highest since March 2008 on
Nov. 17. Last week, Nomura International Ltd. rated Mauritian
stocks as “bullish” in new coverage, saying the country was
well-positioned to act as a financial hub between the Middle
East, North Africa and India.  Benimadhu didn’t provide a time frame for the project.
“It’s still very premature to discuss about the
characteristics, attributes and structure of any partnership,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
