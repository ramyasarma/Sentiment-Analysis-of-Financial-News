What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 6 cents to 7 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade after China ordered banks to
increase reserves, part of government efforts to slow inflation
that may reduce demand for commodities, said  Mario Balletto , a
grain analyst for CitiGroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 15 cents to 18 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago on concern that economic growth may slow in China,
the biggest importer and consumer, Balletto said. Soybean-meal
futures may open $4 to $5 lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean
oil is expected to open down 0.6 cent to 0.7 cent a pound, he
said.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as food and animal-feed demand may slow in China,
the world’s biggest grain-producing nation, Balletto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
