Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  may
reconcile with  Gianfranco Fini , co-founder of his ruling party
who broke with the premier in July, allowing the government to
survive a confidence vote next month and serve out the rest of
his term, said a key Fini ally.  Roberto Menia , one of the four Fini allies who quit
Berlusconi’s government on Nov. 15 to speed its collapse, said
today in an interview on Canale 5 television that the economic
situation required “political unity” and may prompt Berlusconi
and Fini to find an agreement.  Fini this month called on Berlusconi to resign and
President  Giorgio Napolitano  agreed to confidence votes in both
houses of parliament for Dec. 14. Fini’s new Future and Liberty
Party has enough votes in the Chamber of Deputy to bring down
the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
