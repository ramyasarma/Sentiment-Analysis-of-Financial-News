Merck & Co. ’s Fosamax osteoporosis
drug isn’t responsible for a Florida woman’s dental and jaw
problems, a New York jury found today.  Judith Graves sued Merck in 2006, alleging the company
failed to warn doctors and patients that the bone-loss drug was
linked to jaw tissue death. Graves said she developed jaw
problems requiring multiple surgeries after taking the drug.
 Merck  said her condition was connected to underlying medical
conditions.  “The evidence showed the company acted properly and that
Fosamax did not cause the plaintiff’s dental and jaw problems,”
Mike Brock, Merck’s attorney, said in a statement. “The
plaintiff had multiple medical conditions that can cause people
to develop jaw and dental problems.”  Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, is facing
more than 1,500 claims in federal and state courts alleging
Fosamax defects, the company said. With today’s decision, Merck
has won two of the three cases that have gone to a  jury verdict .
In the third case, the jury’s $8 million award was reduced to
$1.5 million last month.  “We are obviously disappointed as every single treating
doctor testified Fosamax caused Mrs. Graves’ osteonecrosis of
the jaw,” her lawyer, Tim O’Brien, said today in an e-mail.
Graves will appeal, he said.  The case is Graves v. Merck & Co., 1:06-cv-05513, U.S>
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
