South Africa’s sugar production will
be 1.95 million metric tons for the season ending in March,
marking the smallest crop in 15 years, the South African Sugar
Association said.  The estimate is down from 1.964 million tons, the Mount
Edgecombe, South Africa-based industry group said on its  website 
today.  Illovo Sugar Ltd. , Africa’s biggest producer of the
sweetener, said yesterday “severe drought” has disrupted its
production.  South Africa’s biggest sugar producers are Illovo Sugar
Ltd., Tongaat Hulett Ltd., Crookes Brothers Ltd. and TSB Sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
