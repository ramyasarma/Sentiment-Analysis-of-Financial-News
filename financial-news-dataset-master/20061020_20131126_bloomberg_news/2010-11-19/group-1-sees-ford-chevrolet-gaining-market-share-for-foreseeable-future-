General Motors Co.’s  Chevrolet and
 Ford Motor Co. ’s namesake brand may increase their market shares
for the “foreseeable future,” said the chief executive officer
of the  Group 1 Automotive Inc.  dealership chain.  Group 1, the Houston-based owner of 101 dealerships, is
pursuing acquisitions of Chevrolet and Ford stores for the first
time since 2005, CEO  Earl Hesterberg  said in a telephone
interview.  “We didn’t want to invest in shrinking businesses,”
Hesterberg said Nov. 16. “We wouldn’t be afraid to invest in
them right now. That has changed. Both Ford and Chevy are very
strong brands and have great prospects to grow market share in
the foreseeable future.”  Domestic brands accounted for 14 percent of Group 1’s new-
vehicle sales in the third quarter, down from 29 percent in
2006, the company said in its earnings  presentation  last month.
Group 1 reported net income of $19 million, the highest since
the third quarter of 2007.  U.S. auto sales in November are “stable to positive” and
“in line with what we saw in October,” Hesterberg said. The
company’s board declared a 10 cent  dividend  on Nov. 11 after
suspending a payout in February last year.  “If we thought there was any risk to another downturn, our
board would not have approved a dividend,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
