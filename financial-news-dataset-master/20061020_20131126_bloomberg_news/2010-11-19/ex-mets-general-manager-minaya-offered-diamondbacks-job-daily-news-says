Omar Minaya , the former New York
Mets’ general manager, has been offered a position as special
assistant with the Arizona Diamondbacks, the New York  Daily News 
reported, citing unidentified people.  Minaya, 52, fired as Mets general manager and executive
vice president of baseball operations on Oct. 4 with two years
and about $2.5 million remaining on his contract. In six seasons
under Minaya the Mets made the playoffs once, in 2006.  When he was fired, Minaya mentioned that he and the Mets
had discussed his staying with the team in another capacity.
Minaya will meet with his replacement as general manager,  Sandy Alderson , to discuss a possible position with the Mets, the
report said.  Jay Horwitz , the Mets’ vice president of media relations,
said in a telephone interview that he was unaware of the
Diamondbacks’ job offer. Horowitz also said there were no
updates as to Minaya’s possible future with the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
