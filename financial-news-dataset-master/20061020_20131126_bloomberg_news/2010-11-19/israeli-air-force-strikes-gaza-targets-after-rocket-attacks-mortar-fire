The Israeli Air Force struck what it
said were three locations in the Gaza Strip linked to terrorism
activities, according to an e-mailed statement today from the
Army Spokesman’s Office.  The strikes were in response to four incidents of rocket
and mortar fire from Gaza into southern Israel over the past two
days, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
