Mauritius’s trade deficit was little
changed at 5.22 billion rupees ($176 million) in September
compared with a month earlier, the Central Statistics Office
said.  Exports fell 3.3 percent to 5.8 billion rupees and imports
declined 1.8 percent to 11 billion rupees, the Port Louis-based
agency said in a statement on its website today. The U.K. took
21 percent of the Indian Ocean island country’s exports while
India was the biggest importer, accounting for 18 percent of
shipments, it said.  Mauritius’s trade gap may widen to 67 billion rupees this
year because of the impact of the euro crisis, Finance Minister
 Pravind Jugnauth  said on Aug. 17. The shortfall totaled 31.5
billion rupees for the first half of 2010, about half of the
country’s imports, according to the statistics agency.  Apparel and clothing accessories are the country’s biggest
exports, accounting for about 40 percent of goods sold
internationally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
