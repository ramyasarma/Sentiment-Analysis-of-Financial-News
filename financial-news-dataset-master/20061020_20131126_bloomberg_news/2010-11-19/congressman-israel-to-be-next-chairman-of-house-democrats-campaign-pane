Representative  Steve Israel  of New
York will be the next chairman of the House Democrats’ campaign
committee, outgoing Speaker  Nancy Pelosi   said today .  Israel, 52, first elected to the House in 2000, will be in
charge of recruiting candidates, raising money and providing
other campaign help for the 2012 House elections.  Democrats lost their House majority in this month’s
elections, as Republicans made a net pickup of at least 61
seats. Republicans will control the House that convenes in early
January by more than 20 seats.  Israel replaces Representative  Chris Van Hollen  of Maryland
as the head of the  Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
Israel served as an assistant to Van Hollen.  “Steve Israel has demonstrated extraordinary capabilities
in recruiting candidates, in attracting resources, and in
communicating core Democratic values for middle class and
working families,” Pelosi, a California Democrat, said in a
statement announcing the New Yorker’s appointment.  The DCCC  raised  $129 million for the 2010 elections, while
its Republican counterpart took in $107 million. The chairman of
the  National Republican Congressional Committee , Representative
 Pete Sessions  of Texas, will remain in that post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
