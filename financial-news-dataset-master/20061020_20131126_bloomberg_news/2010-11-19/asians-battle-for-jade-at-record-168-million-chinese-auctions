The sale of an 18-century white-jade
carving has rounded off a series of auctions of Chinese art in
the U.K. that raised a record 105 million pounds ($168 million).  The carving of a deer with its young fetched 3.8 million
pounds at  Woolley & Wallis  in Salisbury, west England. The price
was the second-highest of the series after the 51.6 million
pounds for a Qianlong Imperial vase, an auction record for
Chinese art, also set at a regional saleroom,  Bainbridges  in
west London.  Asian collectors are prepared to pay ever-higher prices for
objects associated with Chinese emperors, wherever in the world
they are offered, dealers said.  “China has always been the poor relation of Western art,”
said London-based dealer  Alastair Gibson , a director of  Asian
Art in London . “Now, it’s up there with Picasso and Warhol.”  Bonhams and  Sotheby’s  had totals of 10.6 million pounds and
14.1 million pounds, respectively, for their Chinese sales.
 Christie’s International Plc  raised 18.6 million pounds, a 98
percent increase on November 2009, it said.  Woolley & Wallis’s 343-lot event on Nov. 17 raised 10
million pounds, a record for the auction house. Its Qianlong-
period carving had been estimated at 400,000 pounds to 600,000
pounds. It was bought in the room by Xu Zhe Hao, a Cixi City-
based dealer in Zhejiang province, who said he was bidding on
behalf of a collector in Hangzhou.  Xu was one of at least 10 bidders, six on the phone and the
rest among the garrulous crowd of about 20 Asians in the strip-
lit saleroom.  Even with the headline-grabbing vase sale on Nov. 11,
dealers said there was some selective buying. Woolley & Wallis,
 Christie’s  and  Sotheby’s  had respective unsold rates of 33
percent, 44 percent and 37 percent.  “Asian buyers are no longer paying crazy money for
anything,” said Clare Durham of Woolley & Wallis. “They’re
learning to be more discriminating.”  ( Scott Reyburn  writes for Muse, the arts and culture
