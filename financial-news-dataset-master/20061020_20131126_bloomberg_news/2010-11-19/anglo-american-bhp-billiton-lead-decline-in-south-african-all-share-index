South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  declined for the third day in four, retreating
175.18, or 0.6 percent, to 31,398.82 at the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg, extending this week’s drop to 0.9 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock
index, dropped 1.83 rand, or 0.6 percent, to 325.16 rand, the
third decline in four days. Copper fell in New York and London
after China told banks to set aside more reserves, adding to
steps by the government to control inflation and possibly curb
demand for industrial metals used in cars and homes.  BHP Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ), the world’s biggest mining
company retreated 4.24 rand, or 1.6 percent, to 258.61 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ), Africa’s largest producer
of the precious metal, retreated 3.10 rand, or 0.9 percent, to
334.39 rand. Gold fell as much as 0.9 percent to $1,348 an
ounce.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI SJ), a producer of the metal in South
Africa, declined for the fourth day in five, losing 50 cents, or
0.4 percent, to 117.50 rand, the lowest close in two weeks. The
company said a week-long strike at its South Deep mine in
Johannesburg is continuing. Separately, Gold Fields said safety
regulators were expected to visit its Driefontein No. 1 shaft
today. A worker was killed in an accident at the shaft on
Tuesday.  Dorbyl Ltd.  (DLV SJ), an engineering company based in
Johannesburg, slid 8 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 3.07 rand. The
company said its first-half loss through September narrowed to
475,000 rand ($68,000) from a loss of 28.3 million in the
earlier corresponding period.  Firestone Energy Ltd.  (FSE SJ), a coal producer, added 2
cents, or 8.7 percent, to 25 cents, the biggest advance in
almost a month. Firestone said its Sesoko mine in South Africa’s
Limpopo province is the most cost-competitive coal project
second to Exxaro Resources Ltd.’s Grootgeluk next to electricity
provider Eskom Holdings Ltd.’s newest coal-fired power plant,
Medupi.  Simmer & Jack Mines Ltd.  (SIM SJ) rose 1 cent, or 1.1
percent, to 91 cents. The gold producer raised $20 million in a
forward sale of 2,030 ounces of gold and used the proceeds to
repay 105 million rand on an outstanding loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
