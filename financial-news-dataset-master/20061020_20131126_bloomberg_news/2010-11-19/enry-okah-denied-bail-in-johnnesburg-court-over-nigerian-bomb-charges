A South African judge denied bail to
alleged Nigerian rebel leader  Henry Okah , who’s facing charges
that he organized bombings in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, his
lawyer said.  Okah will appeal the decision today by Magistrate Hein Louw
at the Regional Court, his lawyer, Piet du Plessis, said in a
phone interview from Johannesburg. The judge believed there was
a credible case against Okah, he said.  The state rejected Okah’s denials that he was a leader of
the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and had
made notes in his diary about arms purchases, du Plessis said.  Okah also denies South African charges that he masterminded
twin bomb blasts in Abuja that killed 12 people on Oct. 1, when
the West African nation was celebrating its 50th year of
independence from the U.K.  Attacks by MEND and other armed groups cut more than 28
percent of the Nigeria’s oil output between 2006 and 2009,
according to Bloomberg data. While the attacks decreased after
thousands of fighters accepted a government amnesty last year,
MEND refused to disarm, saying its demands for local control of
oil revenue weren’t met.  MEND said today that its fighters killed 10 government
soldiers in an attack yesterday and that it plans to take more
hostages from the region’s oil installations.  President Goodluck Jonathan, who is from the Niger River
delta region, will seek to extend his rule as leader of Africa’s
most populous nation and biggest oil producer in the elections
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
