Ex-Chicago White Sox Latin America
scout Jorge Oquendo Rivera pleaded not guilty to taking
kickbacks when signing prospective Major League Baseball players
for the team.  Oquendo, 49, one of three former team employees whose
indictment was announced on Nov. 10, entered his plea today
through his lawyer, Luis Rivera, in Chicago. Prosecutors alleged
the three received more than $400,000 from 23 players’ signing
bonuses from 2004 to 2008.  Also charged were David S. Wilder, 50, a former White Sox
player personnel director, and Victor Mateo, 39, a Dominican
Republic scout. They are to appear for arraignment on Dec. 9,
U.S. District Judge  Charles R. Norgle  said today.  Wilder and Oquendo face seven counts of mail fraud, each
punishable by up to 20 years’ imprisonment. Mateo faces three
counts of mail fraud.  Outside the courtroom, Oquendo’s lawyer declined to comment
on the charges against his client.  The White Sox won baseball’s World Series championship in
2005. Wilder, of San Francisco, was the team’s farm system
director from 2003 to 2006, then director of player personnel
until he was fired with Mateo in 2008.  Oquendo was fired a year earlier for reasons unrelated to
the kickback investigation, the team said in a Nov. 10 press
statement.  The case is U.S. v. Wilder, 1:10-cr-00948, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
