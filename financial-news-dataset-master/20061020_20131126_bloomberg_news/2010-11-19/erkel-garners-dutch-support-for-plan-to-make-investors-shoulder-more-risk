Chancellor Angela Merkel said that
Germany and the Netherlands are working “closely” on drafting
a permanent crisis-resolution mechanism, as the Dutch government
backed her demand to make private investors shoulder more risk.  Merkel, speaking to reporters in Berlin today after talks
with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, said that Germany and the
Netherlands cooperated well during the financial and economic
crisis, through the Greek turmoil and subsequent action taken in
May to set up a euro rescue fund. They are working equally
closely on the mechanism for indebted euro-area countries to
come into effect from 2013, she said.  In the mechanism being drafted for a December summit of
European Union leaders, “what’s important for us is that it
will involve treaty changes and we’ll support that,” Rutte said
at the same briefing. “What’s important is that IMF and private
investors are involved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
