Canada’s competition watchdog said
today it is launching legal proceedings against Rogers
Communications Inc. over “misleading” advertising.  The Competition Bureau said in an e-mailed statement that
while Rogers claims its Chatr service has fewer dropped calls,
it’s own review of data found no substantial difference. The
Bureau brought its case to the Ontario Superior Court of
Justice. It wants Rogers to stop the ads and pay a C$10 million
($9.8 million) fine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
