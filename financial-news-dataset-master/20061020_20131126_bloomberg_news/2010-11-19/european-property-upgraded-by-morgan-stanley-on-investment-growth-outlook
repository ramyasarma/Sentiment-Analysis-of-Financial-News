Morgan Stanley raised its rating on
 European real estate,  saying the stocks will probably outperform
the broader market “well into 2011” on rising investment.  Analysts including London-based  Bart Gysens  upgraded the
industry as a whole to “attractive” from “cautious,”
according to a note to investors.  British Land Co. , the U.K.’s
second-largest real estate investment trust,  Segro Plc  and  Unite
Group Plc  were Morgan Stanley’s top picks.  “Rising liquidity and inflation should more than offset
headwinds by debt deleveraging and refinancing in the medium
term,” Gysens said. Listed European property companies will
continue their recent trend of outpacing the broader market into
next year, he said.  Morgan Stanley lifted its ratings on  Derwent London Plc  and
 Great Portland Estates Plc , developers that focus on London’s
West End district, to “overweight” from “equal weight.” It
lowered  Hammerson Plc  and  London & Stamford Property Plc  to
“equal weight” from “overweight.”  Fonciere des Regions SA , France’s second-largest publicly
traded office landlord, and  Castellum AB , the third-largest
Swedish commercial real estate company, were upgraded to “equal
weight” from “underweight.”  Morgan Stanley lowered ratings on  Corio NV , the largest
Dutch real estate company, and  PSP Swiss Property AG ,
Switzerland’s largest property company by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
