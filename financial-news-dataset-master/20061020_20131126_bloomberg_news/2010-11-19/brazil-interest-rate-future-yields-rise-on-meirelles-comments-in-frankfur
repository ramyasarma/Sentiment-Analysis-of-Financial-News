Brazil’s most-traded interest-rate
futures contracts jumped after central bank President Henrique
Meirelles said the country needs to tighten monetary policy to
bring demand growth “to a more sustainable level.”  The yield on the interest-rate future contract maturing in
January 2012, the most active in Sao Paulo trading, rose 8 basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 11.72 percent at 8:01 a.m.
New York time. The real fell 0.4 percent to 1.7176 per dollar.  Meirelles, speaking in Frankfurt, said there’s a mismatch
between supply and demand in Brazil that needs to be addressed.  “We have to tighten the monetary policy rate to keep
domestic demand growth, bring it to a more sustainable level,”
he said. “We have taken prudential measures to avoid the bubble
from forming. We’re addressing the question of current account
imbalances.”  The yield on the January 2012 interest-rate futures
extended gains spurred earlier after the government reported the
IGP-M inflation index showed prices accelerated a more than
estimated 1.2 percent in the period from Oct. 21 through Nov.
10.  Brazil’s currency weakened for the first time in three days
against the dollar after China ordered banks to set aside larger
reserves, spurring speculation demand in the nation’s biggest
export market will ease.  To contact the reporters on the story:
