Unemployment  in  California , the
most-populous U.S. state, remained at 12.4 percent last month,
above the national 9.6 percent  rate , according to the state
Employment Development Department.  Nonfarm payroll jobs increased by 39,000 during the month,
the agency said today in a report. The gain followed a revised
loss of 53,600 jobs in September, the state said.  The jobless rate in California, with the world’s eighth-
largest  economy , has been 12 percent or more for the past 15
months, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg . Governor-elect
 Jerry Brown , a Democrat and the state’s attorney general,
campaigned on a pledge to increase jobs in California as it
recovers from the longest recession since the Great Depression.  The home to Silicon Valley computer makers  Apple Inc.  and
 Hewlett-Packard Co.  had the nation’s third-highest unemployment
rate in September, trailing only Nevada, at 14.4 percent, and
Michigan, at 13 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. North Dakota had the lowest rate, at 3.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
