The natural-rubber cash price in
Thailand, the largest producer and exporter, climbed to a record
132.25 baht ($4.42) per kilogram as heavy rain and floods in the
country’s south damaged trees, tightening supply,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
