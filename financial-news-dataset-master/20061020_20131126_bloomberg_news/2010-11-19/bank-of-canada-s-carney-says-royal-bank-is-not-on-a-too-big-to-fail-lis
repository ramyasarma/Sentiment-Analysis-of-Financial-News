Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney
said that Royal Bank of Canada is not on a policy makers’ list
of banks that are “too big to fail.”  “Let me first clarify that RBC is not on that list,”
Carney said in an interview to be broadcast on CBC Radio’s
Sunday Edition with Michael Enright. “There’s a report that it
might be but that was an unsourced report.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
