Gold may decline in New York after
China raised bank reserve ratios again, curbing demand for
bullion.  China ordered its banks for the fifth time this year to set
aside larger reserves. Gold earlier gained as the euro climbed
against the dollar amid optimism a bailout for Ireland will
limit contagion across Europe’s larger debt markets. Bullion
futures, which usually move inversely to the greenback, reached
a record $1,424.30 an ounce on Nov. 9.  “Today’s China announcement is a strong signal that the
next benchmark interest-rate increase will probably be announced
within two weeks,” said  Bayram Dincer , an analyst at LGT
Capital Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland. Higher rates
would “be negative for gold” because they would constrain
Chinese investors’ liquidity and increase the opportunity cost
of holding the metal, he said.  Gold futures for December delivery lost $4.60, or 0.3
percent, to $1,348.40 an ounce at 8:38 a.m. on the Comex in New
York, erasing a gain of as much as 0.7 percent. The metal for
immediate delivery in London was 0.3 percent lower at $1,348.90.  Bullion rose to $1,357.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,350.25 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Twelve
of 19 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, or
63 percent, said the metal will rise next week. Four forecast
lower prices and three were neutral.  Draining Cash  The reserve ratio will increase 0.5 percentage point
starting Nov. 29, the People’s Bank of China said. It’s draining
cash from the financial system in an effort to limit inflation
and asset-bubble risks in the world’s fastest-growing major
economy.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, slid as much as 0.6 percent, fueling
demand for bullion as an alternative investment, and was last
down 0.2 percent.  “The dollar is still in a very unstable position,” said
 Bernard Sin , head of currency and metal trading at bullion
refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva. “The market is still
concerned. There’s no confidence in Europe.”  Ireland’s central-bank governor, Patrick Honohan, said he
expects his nation will seek a package worth “tens of
billions” of euros to help rescue banks battered by the
country’s property slump. Officials of the European Union,
International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank yesterday
started to study the banks’ books.  ETP Holdings  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products fell 4.56 metric
tons to 2,082.65 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. That’s the biggest drop in three
weeks. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14.  Silver for December delivery in New York fell 0.4 percent
to $26.73 an ounce after yesterday jumping 5.2 percent, the most
in two weeks. It reached a 30-year high of $29.34 last week and
is up 59 percent this year.  Canada’s sales of silver coins will jump more than 50
percent this year and will continue to climb in 2011, said David
Madge, director of sales at the Royal Canadian Mint.  Palladium for December delivery gained 1.2 percent to
$703.50 an ounce, erasing a drop and extending yesterday’s
advance of 6.2 percent, the most since May. Platinum for January
delivery was 0.4 percent lower at $1,657.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
