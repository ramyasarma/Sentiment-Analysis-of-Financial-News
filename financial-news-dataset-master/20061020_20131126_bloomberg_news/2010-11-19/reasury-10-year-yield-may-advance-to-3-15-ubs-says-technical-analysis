The gain in the Treasury 10-year
note  yield  that began last month may extend to above 3 percent
as investors unwind positions and new U.S. debt is issued, said
strategists at UBS AG, citing stochastic indicators.  The yield on the benchmark  10-year note  touched 2.96
percent on Nov. 16, rising 0.39 percentage point since the
Federal Reserve said on Nov. 3 that it will start to buy
$600 billion in Treasuries “to help ensure that inflation, over
time, is at levels consistent with its mandate.” The yield was
2.87 percent today.  “Investors seem more concerned with damage control than
taking a proactive stance,” wrote a team of strategists at UBS
led by  Mike Schumacher , head of global rates strategy in
Stamford, Connecticut. “In this environment -- with supply and
a holiday week looming -- it would not be surprising to see
rates make a further move to higher ground.”  The next important level of support, according to UBS, lies
in the area of 3.15 percent, approaching the 200-day moving
average and the 61.8 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the April-
to-October yield slide from 4.01 percent to 2.33.  A Fibonacci retracement level refers to a series of numbers
known as the Fibonacci sequence that are used by technical
analysts to identify support and resistance based on
retracements of past price changes. Support is an area where buy
orders may be clustered, making further declines in note prices,
or alternatively rises in their yields, more difficult.  Financial markets will be closed on Nov. 25 for the U.S.
Thanksgiving Day holiday. The Treasury will sell $35 billion of
two-year notes, $35 billion in five-year debt and $29 billion of
seven-year securities during three days starting Nov. 22.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
