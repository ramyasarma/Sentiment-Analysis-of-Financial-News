Madagascar’s army urged families
close to where rebel officers are based to evacuate in case
soldiers need to use force to arrest them.  “The army are in place,” Philibert Ratovonirina, head of
communications for the army, said today in a phone interview
from Antananarivo, the capital. “Negotiations are continuing
but if they don’t lead to something we will have to resort to
force to break this up.” More troops have been sent to the
area, he said.  About 20 dissident officers who tried to overthrow
President  Andry Rajoelina  two days ago are at an army base near
the airport in the city. The officers, including ex-defense
minister General  Noel Rakotonandrasana , have refused to
surrender since the failed coup.  Rajoelina, the 36-year-old former mayor of Antananarivo,
came to power 20 months ago when the military helped oust Marc
Ravalomanana, leading to the Indian Ocean island nation’s
political and economic isolation. Madagascar is the world’s
biggest vanilla producer and and has nickel deposits.  The “Yes” vote in a referendum for a new constitution
that opponents say is aimed to prolong his rule, led with 69
percent of the vote late yesterday, based on results from 4,550
of 18,000 polling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
