Natural gas climbed in New York,
posting the first weekly increase this month, on forecasts of
below-normal temperatures that may spark greater demand for the
heating fuel.  Colder-than-normal weather may blanket most of the eastern
U.S. from Nov. 24 through Nov. 28, according to Commodity
Weather Group in Bethesda, Maryland. Temperatures in parts of
the Midwest may be as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit below normal,
the company said.  “It looks pretty inevitable that the market has gains in
front of it,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Natural gas for December delivery rose 15.7 cents, or 3.9
percent, to settle at $4.164 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract, down 25
percent this year, gained 9.6 percent this week.  “Once we get our first real signs of heating demand, the
market will probably reach $4.50 or $4.75,” McGillian said.  Temperatures may be below normal on the East Coast and
parts of the Southeast and Great Lakes region from Nov. 29
through Dec. 3, Commodity Weather Group said.  The high temperature in Chicago on Nov. 25 may be 31
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 1 Celsius), 12 degrees below normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania.  “A surge of record warmth will make it into the Ohio
Valley Sunday into Monday, but the cold coming is going to be
the most extreme shot to end the month of November in many a
year,” said  Joe Bastardi , a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather
Inc., in a note to clients.  Fuel Use  Heating demand in the U.S. may average 20 percent above
normal from Nov. 25 through Nov. 29, according to  David Salmon ,
a meteorologist with Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, Energy Department data show.  Gas inventories may total 1.776 trillion cubic feet at the
end of the winter heating season in March, up about 114 billion
cubic feet from a year earlier, the Energy Department estimated
on Nov. 9 in the monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Gas  inventories  gained 3 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Nov. 12 to 3.843 trillion cubic feet, the Energy
Department said in a report yesterday. The increase left
stockpiles 9.3 percent above the five-year average level for
that week and 0.3 percent above last year’s level, signaling
ample supplies for the winter, when use of the fuel peaks.  Storage Surplus  “Cold temperatures would need to linger for some time to
work off the current storage overhang,” wrote  James R. Crandell , an analyst with Barclays Capital in New York, in a
note to clients today.  The number of oil and natural-gas rigs operating in the
U.S. fell for the first time in four weeks, led by declines in
natural-gas drilling, according to data published today by Baker
Hughes Inc.  Gas rigs dropped by 19 to 936, the biggest one-week decline
since June. The total is down 42 percent from a peak of 1,606 in
September 2008.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, fell 9.55 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $3.7917 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
258,854 as of 2:39 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
269,000. Volume was 338,358 yesterday. Open interest was 767,811
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 807,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
