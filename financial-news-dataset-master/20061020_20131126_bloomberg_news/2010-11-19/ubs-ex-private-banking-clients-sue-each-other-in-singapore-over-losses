UBS AG’s  Singapore unit sued two
former private banking clients, saying they failed to pay for
investment losses of S$9.3 million ($7.2 million). The couple
countersued, accusing UBS of negligence in investment advice.  UBS  claims Ng Kok Keong and his wife Yow Sin May placed
bets on foreign currencies and failed to pay for a shortfall in
their account, according to court papers filed with the
Singapore High Court. The trial is scheduled to start Nov. 22.  Ng had limited experience in the financial market and
relied on UBS and banker Lily See for advice, according to the
couple’s counterclaim.  See belatedly informed Ng and his wife that money in their
account had dipped below minimum requirements and failed to
close certain trades, causing further losses, the couple claimed
in court papers.  Julie Yeo , a Singapore-based spokeswoman at UBS, said the
company doesn’t comment on ongoing legal issues. The couple’s
lawyer Kelvin Chia also declined to comment. UBS is represented
by Cavinder Bull from  Drew & Napier LLC .  The case is UBS AG, Singapore Branch v. Ng Kok Keong & Yow
Sin May S390/2009 in the Singapore High Court.  To contact the reporters on this story:
