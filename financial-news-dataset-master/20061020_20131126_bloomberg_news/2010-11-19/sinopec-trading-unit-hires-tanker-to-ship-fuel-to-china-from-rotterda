China International United Petroleum
& Chemical Corp., the trading unit known as Unipec, hired a
supertanker to carry fuel to China from Rotterdam, according to
reports from two companies including Optima Shipbrokers Ltd.  Unipec, China’s biggest oil trader, chartered the Athenian
Success, a Very Large Crude Carrier, to load 275,000 metric tons
on Dec. 4, according to today’s reports, which didn’t specify
whether the cargo is crude or fuel oil. Rotterdam is part of the
European storage hub that includes Amsterdam and Antwerp.  China typically sources its crude from the Middle East,
Asia and West Africa. Specific requirements for fuel oil are
sometimes drawn from more distant locations such as northwest
Europe, in addition to nearby Asian countries.  Unipec, a unit of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or
Sinopec, the country’s largest oil refiner, didn’t reply to two
phone messages left at its London office and a call to its
Singapore unit. China last year overtook the U.S. as the world’s
largest energy consumer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
