Eskom Holdings Ltd., the largest
provider of power in southern Africa, is reducing supplies to
Botswana as the South African state-owned utility struggles to
meet demand in its home country.  Eskom cut its maximum supply to Botswana, the world’s
largest diamond-producing nation, by 40 percent to 250 megawatts
in the past two years, the Johannesburg-based utility said in an
e-mailed reply to queries yesterday. “The current agreement
will continue to decline in capacity until end 2012 when it
expires.”  Funding constraints have delayed Eskom’s 485 billion-rand
($69 billion) capacity-expansion program aimed at preventing
repeats of shortages that temporarily shut platinum and gold
mines in South Africa in January 2008. Eskom’s surplus is at
times as low as 5 percent, against its target of 15 percent,
Mbulelo Ncetezo, electricity manager at the National Energy
Regulator of South Africa, said at a conference in Johannesburg
yesterday.  Eskom supplied about 410 megawatts to Botswana prior to
2008 and Botswana will start the Morupule coal-fired power plant
with 600 megawatts of capacity in 2012, the power producer said.  Botswana has electricity shortages that may worsen over the
next two years, Energy Minister Ponatshego Kedikilwe said in
June. Debswana Diamond Co., a joint venture between De Beers SA
and Botswana’s government, is building a 90 megawatt power plant
to supply electricity to two of its mines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
