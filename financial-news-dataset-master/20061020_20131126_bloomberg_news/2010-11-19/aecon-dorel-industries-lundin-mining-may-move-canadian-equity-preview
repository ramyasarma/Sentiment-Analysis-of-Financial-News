     Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) --  Canadian stocks  rose, completing a
weekly gain, as banks advanced on prospects of earnings growth
and natural gas producers rallied with the commodity.  Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest lender by
assets, increased 1.9 percent as UBS AG named it its “most-
preferred” Canadian bank stock. Manulife, North America’s
fourth-biggest insurer, fell 2.2 percent after  surging  24
percent from Nov. 2 through yesterday. EnCana Corp., Canada’s
biggest natural gas producer, rallied 2.8 percent as the fuel

points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,956.33. For the week, the Canadian
benchmark climbed 1.6 percent.  “There’s a little bit of expectations on the earnings
coming up, that the banks will report better news than first
thought,” said  Adrian Mastracci , a money manager at KCM Wealth
Management Inc. in Vancouver and leader in the Globe & Mail’s
annual stock-picking competition for financial professionals.
“It’s one of the safe harbors to go to -- you can’t go wrong
with a Canadian bank.”  The index surged  2.4 percent  over the past two days, the
biggest two-day gain since July 6-7, as Ireland said it is
prepared to accept a bailout of its finances and Western Coal
Corp. received a takeover offer from Walter Energy Corp.  The  S&P/TSX Banks Index  rose 1.3 percent today to finish
its biggest weekly gain in four months.  Earnings Season  The six largest banks are scheduled to report fourth-
quarter earnings from Nov. 30 to Dec. 7. Analyst  estimates  for
fourth-quarter S&P/TSX Banks Index profits have increased 6.9
percent over the past month, according to Bloomberg data.  Royal Bank advanced 1.9 percent to C$55.32 after UBS said
it “is among the best positioned to grow organically and reduce
costs.” Bank of Montreal, Canada’s fourth-biggest bank,
increased 1.9 percent to C$60.33 after  Brad Smith , an analyst at
Stonecap Securities Inc., raised his 12-month price estimate on
the stock to C$56 from C$53. Bank of Nova Scotia, the No. 3
lender by assets, climbed 1.2 percent to C$54.65.  Manulife fell for the first time this week, dropping 2.2
percent to C$15.35. In a presentation to investors, Chief
Executive Officer  Donald Guloien  said he wasn’t providing a
profit forecast for next year. He did say the insurer aims to
earn C$4 billion ($3.93 billion) a year by 2015.  “They have a long way to go, and I would like to see them
concentrate on what they’re going to do in the next six months
to a year,” Mastracci said.  Cool Weather  Natural gas rose to an eight-day high on forecasts for
below-normal temperatures in the eastern U.S.  EnCana gained for the first time in six days, advancing 2.8
percent to C$29.26. Talisman Energy Inc., an oil and gas
producer with  operations  in North America, the North Sea and

Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the country’s second-largest
energy company by market value, climbed 1.3 percent to C$40.49.  BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. rose 2.1 percent
to C$59.76 after Marvell Technology Group Ltd. reported  earnings 
that topped the average analyst estimate. Marvell makes
processors for BlackBerry devices.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., Canada’s
largest drugmaker, retreated 1.6 percent to C$25.09 after
increasing the size of a debt offering by 43 percent to $1
billion.  Cline Mining Corp., which is developing coal mine in the
