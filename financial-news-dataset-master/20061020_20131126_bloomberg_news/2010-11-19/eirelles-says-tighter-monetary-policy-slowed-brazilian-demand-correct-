(Corrects headline and first paragraph to show Meirelles
was talking about past interest-rate decisions.)  Brazilian central bank President
 Henrique Meirelles  said the country tightened monetary policy to
bring demand growth “to a more sustainable level.”  “We have tightened the monetary policy rate in order to
keep the domestic demand growth, basically to bring it to a more
sustainable level,” he said in Frankfurt. “We have taken
prudential measures in order to avoid the bubble forming. And at
the same time we are addressing directly the question of current
account imbalances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
