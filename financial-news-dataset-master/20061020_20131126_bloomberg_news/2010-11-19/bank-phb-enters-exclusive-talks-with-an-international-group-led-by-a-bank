Bank PHB Plc, a Nigerian lender
bailed out by the country’s central bank last year, said it
entered into “exclusive negotiations with a consortium of
international financial institutions led by a bank” that may
lead to the lender’s recapitalization.  The transaction would be subject to shareholders’ and
regulatory approval, Lagos-based Bank PHB said in a statement
published in the Guardian newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
