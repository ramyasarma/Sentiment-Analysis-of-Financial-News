Oil may increase next week on
speculation Ireland will accept a European Union-led financial
bailout, reducing concern the region’s debt crisis will spread,
a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Eighteen of 38 analysts, or 47 percent, forecast crude oil
will climb through Nov. 26. Ten respondents, or 26 percent,
predicted prices will fall and 10 estimated there would be
little change. Last week, 43 percent said futures would rise.  Oil surged yesterday after Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  said the government may accept aid from the EU and
International Monetary Fund. EU, IMF and European Central Bank
officials flew into Dublin yesterday to scan the books of the
country’s financial institutions.  “With Europe settling its latest sovereign debt crisis,
the dollar should resume its fall allowing crude oil prices to
rise next week,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital
LLC, a New York-based hedge fund focusing on energy.  The euro sank to $1.3448 on Nov. 16, the lowest level since
Sept. 28, on concern that Ireland’s crisis would spread to
Portugal and, eventually, to Spain, the euro region’s fourth-
largest economy. The common currency rose 0.3 percent to $1.3686
in New York.  A weaker dollar increases the appeal of commodities as an
alternative investment.  U.S. crude-oil  supplies  dropped 7.29 million barrels to
357.6 million last week, the Energy Department reported on Nov.
17. It was the biggest decline since August 2009.  Crude oil for December delivery declined $3.37, or 4
percent, to $81.51 a barrel this week on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Futures are up 5.2 percent from a year ago.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
