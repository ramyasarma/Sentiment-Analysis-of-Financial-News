North American commercial truck
production may climb as much as 56 percent in 2011 as owners
refresh the oldest U.S. fleet in at least 31 years, boosting
sales at  Paccar Inc.  and partsmakers such as  Eaton Corp.   Output of Class 8 trucks, the workhorses of interstate
hauling, may reach as many as 235,000 units in the U.S., Canada
and Mexico next year from an estimated 151,000 in 2010, said
 Kenny Vieth , partner at market forecaster  ACT Research Co.   Rising freight rates and volumes are helping rekindle
demand after the worst recession since the Great Depression. A
2006 production surge to a record 376,448 units before new U.S.
emissions rules took effect helped create a glut heading into
the economic slump, leaving some trucks parked for two years.  “My members are saying they desperately need to replace
trucks,”  Bob Costello , chief economist for the  American
Trucking Associations , said in an interview.  U.S. trucks now average 6.7 years of age, about 11 months
older than the historical average and the oldest in ACT data
going back to 1979, according to the Columbus, Indiana-based
company. While that fleet has logged fewer miles than usual
because of the drop in shipping, “no matter how we slice it, we
still come up with an answer that it’s old,” Vieth said.  October Orders  Class 8 truck orders for October rose 24 percent from
September, the second-highest monthly total since April 2008,
ACT said in a statement.  North American output in 2011 matching ACT’s forecast or
Robert W. Baird & Co.’s projection of 230,000 units would add to
evidence of a recovery in shipments and vehicle purchases.
Typical replacement demand is about 220,000 trucks, said
 Kristine Kubacki , an Avondale Partners LLC analyst in St. Louis.  “The replacement cycle is kicking in,”  David Leiker , a
Milwaukee-based analyst for Baird, said in an interview. He
recommends buying Paccar and rival  Navistar International Corp .
and holding shares of Sweden’s  Volvo AB .  Daimler AG , the maker of Freightliner trucks, expects the
“vast majority” of 2011 purchases to be replacement vehicles,
said  Mark Lampert , senior vice president of sales and marketing
for the company’s North American truck unit.  That’s the case at San Mateo, California-based  Con-way
Inc. , the second-biggest publicly traded U.S. trucker after  YRC
Worldwide Inc .  ‘Replacement, Not Expansion’  “We intend to continue acquiring tractors for fleet
replacement, not expansion, in 2011,” said  Gary Frantz , a
spokesman. The total will be “equal to or slightly more” than
in 2010, when Con-way bought about 1,300 tractors for the unit
that puts shipments from more than one customer on each trailer.
That business has about 9,000 tractors now, Frantz said.  The 18-month recession that ended in June 2009 ravaged the
shipping industry, helping drag YRC to a third straight annual
loss and sending the ATA’s  freight-tonnage index  to a seven-year
low in April 2009. Sales excluding financial services at
Bellevue, Washington-based Paccar plummeted 48 percent.  Volumes are rising again this year, with truck tonnage up
for a 10th straight month in September on a year-over-year
basis, according to data from Arlington, Virginia-based ATA.
Class 8 truck rentals climbed 27 percent through October,
according to Penske Truck Rental, a venture owned by Penske
Corp.,  General Electric Co . and  Penske Automotive Group Inc .  ‘Significant Growth’  “We think both 2011 and 2012 will be years of significant
growth,” Eaton Chief Executive Officer Sandy Cutler  said in a
Nov. 11 interview. “Used truck prices are up, the inventory of
 used trucks  are down, freight is up, and the trucking companies
have been announcing price increases.”  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg in early November see U.S.
gross domestic product expanding by 2.5 percent in 2011,
compared with world growth of 4.2 percent.  Paccar rose 71 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $54.14 at 4 p.m.
in New York in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. Eaton, a
maker of transmissions, climbed 71 cents to $96.48 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Their respective gains of 49 percent and 52
percent in 2010 outpaced the 7.6 percent advance in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index. Volvo AB, the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, rose 1.1 percent today to 100.10 kronor in
Stockholm.  FTR Associates , a trucking-industry forecaster based in
Nashville, Indiana-based, is less optimistic than ACT and Baird
on Class 8 output in North America next year. Production
probably will be 187,000 vehicles, said President Eric Starks,
who added that shipping volumes remain below their 2006 peak.  As many as 500,000 trucks were idled during the recession,
and about 150,000 remain parked, Starks said.  ‘Dynamics Have Changed’  “Age itself is not a very useful tool to say when you have
to replace equipment,” Starks said. “With such a deep
recession, the dynamics have changed.”  Wear and tear is important because annual maintenance costs
can more than double once a vehicle exceeds 600,000 miles
(965,400 kilometers), said Kubacki, the Avondale Partners
analyst.  “Uncertainty about a recovery sidelined some purchasing
decisions,” she said in an interview. She advises holding
Paccar and buying Warrenville, Illinois-based Navistar.  Parts suppliers such as Cleveland-based Eaton and diesel-
engine maker  Cummins Inc . would join Paccar and Navistar in
benefiting from increased truck sales. Revenue at Eaton’s truck
unit plunged 35 percent to $1.46 billion in 2009. The drop at
Columbus, Indiana-based Cummins was 25 percent to $10.8 billion.  Commercial trucks will be a “strategic area of focus” for
turbocharger maker  BorgWarner Inc . as the government keeps
ratcheting up mileage standards, CEO  Tim Manganello  said in a
Nov. 9 investor conference. Truck manufacturers use
turbochargers to boost fuel economy without sacrificing power.  Investors may have to wait until mid-2011 to see whether
truck operators start buying vehicles to meet rising demand for
shipments instead of just replacing aging tractors, said
Lampert, the executive with Daimler Trucks North America LLC.  “If freight is strong through the first half of next year,
I would not be surprised to see growth for the first time
surface as an initiative for truck purchases,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
