A suspected bomb discovered at a
Namibian airport didn’t contain explosives and may be a dummy
used by governments to test airport security, German broadcaster
ZDF said, citing German officials it didn’t identify.  Which authorities might have placed the device found at the
airport in Windhoek isn’t known, ZDF said today on its website.  The travel bag, whose discovery delayed a Nov. 17 Air
Berlin Plc flight to Munich for hours, contained batteries wired
to a functioning clock and a detonator, Germany’s Federal
Criminal Office, or BKA, said yesterday. There are indications
“that it could be a test,’’ German Interior Minister Thomas de
Maiziere told ZDF yesterday, without elaborating.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
