“Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows -- Part 1” took in $24 million in ticket sales in
midnight shows in the U.S. and Canada, Warner Bros. said.  The film played in 3,700 theaters, the Burbank, California-
based studio said today in an e-mailed statement. The sales
marked a midnight record for the “ Potter ” series, eclipsing
$22.2 million generated by “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood
Prince” in July 2009.  The seventh movie in the series based on  J.K. Rowling ’s
books may generate as much as $128 million over the weekend, the
estimate of Box Office Guru editor  Gitesh Pandya . The franchise,
which had taken in $5.4 billion in worldwide sales before today,
ends next July with “Deathly Hallows -- Part 2.”  Among all films, the $24 million is the third-best midnight
opening after two of the “Twilight” romance vampire films,
according to Hollywood.com Box-Office. The record for a three-
day weekend is $158.4 million, set in 2008 by Warner’s Batman
sequel “The Dark Knight,” according to Box Office Guru.  “Deathly Hallows -- Part 1” may take in as much as $900
million in worldwide sales during its run in theaters, said
 Porter Bibb , an analyst with Mediatech Capital Partners in New
York. The film cost about $250 million to make, according to the
Internet Movie Database.  Time Warner Inc., parent of Warner Bros., rose 25 cents to
$30.76 at 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
 trading . The shares have gained 5.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
