Spain may reduce subsidized rates
for power from new photovoltaic solar generators during a
cabinet meeting today, Cinco Dias reported, citing unidentified
people.  Plants built on open land will receive 45 percent less than
the current price they’re paid, the report said. Rates will
decline 25 percent for large rooftop solar panels installations
and by 5 percent for small ones, typically on homes, the  report 
said.  The draft decree to be considered today would end subsidies
after the first 25 years of a plant’s life, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
