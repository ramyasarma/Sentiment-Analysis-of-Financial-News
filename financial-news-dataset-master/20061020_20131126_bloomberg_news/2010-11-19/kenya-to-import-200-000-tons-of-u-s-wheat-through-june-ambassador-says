The U.S. projects that it will
export about 200,000 metric tons of wheat to Kenya over the next
seven months, after the East African nation this week accepted
its largest-ever shipment of the American grain.  Commodity trader Louis Dreyfus Commodities Ltd. handled the
import of the 50,000 tons of wheat that began being offloaded
yesterday at Mombasa, U.S. Ambassador to Kenya  Michael Ranneberger  told reporters as the shipment arrived at the port.
A copy of his remarks was sent by e-mail today by the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi.  “Apart from this very impressive single shipment, we
understand that 200,000 tons or more of high-quality U.S. wheat
will be imported into Kenya during the marketing year on
strictly commercial terms,” Ranneberger said, referring to the
year through June 2011.  “This will likely be a record year for
U.S. wheat exports into the East African market.”  To meet domestic requirements, the country imports about
120,000 metric tons of grains a month, which represents about 30
percent of its monthly cereal consumption, Standard Bank Group
Ltd. said in February.  Kenya  will review a cut in duties on imported wheat
following protests by domestic growers, the presidency said on
June 29. Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  announced in his annual
budget speech on June 10 that the levy would be reduced to 10
percent from 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
