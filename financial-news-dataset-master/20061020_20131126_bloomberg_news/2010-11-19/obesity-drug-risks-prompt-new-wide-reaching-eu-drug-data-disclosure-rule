Europe’s drug regulator will make
thousands of pages of clinical trial reports public next week
after pressure from drug-safety activists because of suicide
risks linked to  Sanofi-Aventis SA ’s failed diet pill Acomplia.  The European Medicines Agency  will from next week provide
data on request for every drug it has reviewed, Sabine
Haubenreisser, an EMA spokeswoman, said Nov. 17.  The agency  aims
to publish the reports on its website within five years,
Executive Director  Thomas Loenngren  said.  “We are becoming more transparent,” Loenngren said in an
interview in London this month. “We also have a huge pressure
on us to be more transparent. This is a challenge for all of us
in the future.”  The prompt release of full trial reports for every drug
approved or rejected would be a more aggressive policy than that
in the U.S.,  Sidney Wolfe , head of health research at
Washington-based consumer group Public Citizen, said in a
telephone interview. U.S. law requires summary results of trials
under way by September 2007 to be reported for products approved
by the FDA.  Quicker release of data in Europe would be “great news for
the entire world,” Wolfe said. “Once things are made public
there, everyone can get their hands on it.”  The EMA won’t require drugmakers to disclose data deemed
commercial or confidential such as manufacturing information,
Loenngren said. A separate online registry of clinical trials
conducted in Europe is set to go public next year, he said.  New Policy  The new disclosure policy follows a request from
researchers at the Copenhagen-based Nordic  Cochrane Centre  for
clinical trial reports on three obesity drugs:  Roche Holding
AG ’s Xenical,  Abbott Laboratories ’ Meridia and Sanofi’s
Acomplia. The institute wanted to see if the published data
matched up with the more detailed reports submitted to the
regulators, Anders Joergesen, a researcher at the center, said
in a telephone interview yesterday.  “It’s a very detailed report describing the benefits and
harms, more detail than is available for example in medical
journals,” Joergesen said. “The medical journal’s report is
about 10-15 pages, maybe less, and these consist of 100, 200,
300 pages per trial.”  The Danish researchers asked for the reports on June 29,
2007, three weeks after the FDA said Acomplia might raise the
risk of suicide and suicidal thoughts. Abbott’s Meridia had been
linked to increased blood pressure and heart rate, while sales
of Roche’s Xenical had been hampered by embarrassing side
effects such as some patients’ inability to control bowel
movements. All three drugs were already being sold in Europe.  Ombudsman  The researchers were able to get information about Meridia
from Danish health authorities, Joergesen said. The EMA rejected
their request for information on the other two drugs, and the
researchers appealed to  Nikiforos Diamandouros , the Strasbourg,
France-based European ombudsman responsible for investigating
complaints about EU institutions.  The regulator said it wanted to protect the drugmakers’
commercial interests, Diamandouros wrote in a May  report . The
ombudsman rejected that argument after inspecting portions of
the trial data, saying they don’t contain trade secrets, and
called on the agency to release the reports. The EMA was
reworking its policy and took Diamandouros’s comments into
account, Haubenreisser said.  Pulled From Market  Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Illinois, agreed to take
Meridia off the U.S. market in October. The EMA  halted  sales of
the 13-year-old diet pill in January. Acomplia was never
approved in the U.S., and the European regulator pulled the drug
from the market in October 2008. The EMA agreed in 2008 to let
GlaxoSmithKline Plc sell the 12-year-old Xenical’s active
ingredient, orlistat, as the non-prescription diet pill Alli.  Sanofi forecast sales of more than $3 billion a year if
Acomplia had won U.S. approval. Roche’s Xenical generated sales
of 397 million Swiss francs ($398.1 million) last year, less
than the annual revenue of more than $1 billion some analysts
had predicted.  Joergesen said he expects the Danish research team will get
the reports on the diet pills by Dec. 5.  “Their interpretation before was that nobody should have
access to these,” the researcher said. “Let’s see what we get,
because it may be fully redacted and a blank sheet.”  Annette Walz, a spokeswoman at Roche, and Scott Davies, a
spokesman at Abbott, both said that requests for comment should
be directed to the European Federation of Pharmaceutical
Industries and Associations. A telephone message and e-mail to
the  Efpia  weren’t immediately returned.  Marisol Peron , a
spokeswoman at Sanofi, didn’t immediately comment.  Debate  After watching the three-year debate over a link to heart
disease discovered in unpublished studies of  Glaxo ’s diabetes
drug Avandia, the European agency is also considering whether to
hold public hearings as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
does, Loenngren said.  Once the world’s best-selling diabetes medicine, Avandia
was withdrawn from the European market and restricted in the
U.S. in September. Glaxo is “absolutely committed” to openness
and research,  Claire Brough , a spokeswoman for the London-based
company, said in a telephone interview.  “There’s a lesson learned from that experience,”
Loenngren said. “All kinds of secrecy are leading to suspicion
that things aren’t right and are leading to lack of confidence.
So why shouldn’t you be open?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
