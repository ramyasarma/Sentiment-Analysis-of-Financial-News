Nancy Kissel , charged with the 2003
murder of her  Merrill Lynch & Co.  banker husband, will be
retried, a Hong Kong judge ruled, rejecting her application for
the proceedings to be halted.  Judge Andrew Macrae told the media today not to report the
details of his ruling. He previously ordered the media not to
report on the details of her application for a stay.  Michigan-born Kissel, serving a life sentence in prison,
would have been released had her application been successful.
Prosecutors charged her again with murder in March after Hong
Kong’s top court overturned her 2005 conviction. The 46-year-old
mother of three’s retrial is scheduled to begin on Jan. 10.  Kissel’s defense lawyer Derek Chan declined to comment.  Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal said in February that
Kissel’s conviction was flawed because the judge wrongly allowed
hearsay evidence and prosecutors improperly questioned her
during the 2005 trial. Jurors heard in the three-month trial
that she drugged her husband Robert with a milkshake, bludgeoned
him to death and hid his body in a carpet.  The case is Nancy Ann Kissel and HKSAR, HCCC55/2010, Hong
Kong Court of First Instance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
