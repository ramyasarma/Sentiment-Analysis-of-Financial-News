Queensland state may sell shares of
Australian coal-train operator  QR National Ltd.  near the bottom
of an indicated price range in its initial public offering, said
three people familiar with the matter.  The stock, due to start trading in Sydney on Nov. 22, will
probably be sold to institutions for between A$2.55 and A$2.60
each, the people said, declining to be identified because the
pricing discussions are private. The state government said Oct.
11 it would sell the shares at between A$2.50 and A$3 apiece to
raise as much as A$5.05 billion ($5 billion).  Queensland is targeting A$15 billion from asset sales to
replace lost revenue and regain its AAA credit rating. QR
National, set to be Australia’s largest IPO since 1997, will
test the appetite for new listings after Valemus Ltd. scrapped a
A$1.39 billion offer in July and shares of  Myer Holdings Ltd. ,
which raised A$2.1 billion in 2009, trade below the offer price.  “It reflects the market is more cautious than it might
have been,” said  Sandy Grant , who manages about A$140 million
at Wilson HTM Investment Group in Brisbane and bid for QR
National stock. “It’s a very good asset in the long run for
people who are careful enough to take a five-year view.”  Queensland Treasurer  Andrew Fraser  will announce the final
price tomorrow at 12 p.m. Brisbane time, according to an
invitation to the media conference. His office declined to
comment today. Fraser has said the state will retain between 25
percent and 40 percent of QR National until at least 2012. The
Australian Financial Review reported today the stock would fetch
about A$2.55 each in the IPO and the government would keep a 40
percent stake.  More Expensive  If the government keeps a 40 percent stake and sells the
stock at A$2.60 apiece, the IPO will raise as much as A$3.8
billion. The proceeds may be less, depending on how much stock
is taken by retail investors, who get a 10-cent discount on the
institutional price.  Queensland is relying on rising demand for commodities in
China and India to lure investors to the IPO. Even at the bottom
of the indicative range, QR National shares would be more
expensive than those of  Asciano Group , Australia’s biggest
listed port and rail operator.  Based on the A$2.50 to A$3 per share price range, QR
National would trade at 21 times to 25 times estimated earnings
per share for the year ending June 2011, according to the IPO
sale document. Asciano  trades  at 19 times estimated earnings for
the 12 months ending June 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  16,000 Wagons  QR National  operates  700 locomotives, 16,000 wagons and
2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) of track across Australia,
according to a share sale document. Brisbane-based QR National
expects earnings to surge 75 percent in the next two years as
coal shipments rise and mining companies expand projects in
Western Australia state.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization are set to increase 42 percent to A$894 million in
the 12 months ending June 2011, the company said in the IPO
prospectus on Oct. 11. Earnings may rise 23 percent in the
following year, the document showed.  Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch & Co. unit, Credit
Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG are managing the QR
National offering.  Credit Rating Cut  QR National is the third of five assets the state is
selling after Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service
both removed Queensland from the top credit rating in 2009.  The government last week sold the Port of Brisbane,
Australia’s third-biggest container harbor, to a group led by
 Global Infrastructure Partners  and Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority for A$2.1 billion. In June, it completed the sale of a
99-year lease to forest plantations for A$603 million.  The state has sent out requests for expressions of interest
in the  Abbot Point coal terminal  and is working to complete the
sale of a toll-road company by June, Treasurer Fraser said in a
Nov. 11 telephone interview.  No further sales are planned once the residual QR stake is
sold, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
