Japanese stock  indexes  rose for the
third straight week after reports indicated the U.S. recovery is
accelerating, boosting the outlook for the global economy.  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s largest carmaker, climbed
1.6 percent. T&D Holdings Inc., a life insurer, gained 3 percent
after the company reported profits that exceeded its forecast.
Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest brokerage, increased 1.6
percent on better earnings prospects. Elpida Memory Inc., the
world’s third-largest maker of computer-memory chips, jumped 5.7
percent after Daiwa Securities Group Inc. recommended the stock.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.1 percent to 10,022.39
in Tokyo, the highest close since June 22. The broader  Topix 
index gained 0.1 percent to 869.52, a level not seen since July
14. About eight stocks retreated for every seven that climbed.
For the week, the Nikkei has increased 3.1 percent, while the
Topix is up 2.7 percent.  “Pessimistic views of the U.S. economy and the yen’s
appreciation have receded,” said  Naoteru Teraoka , general
manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which
oversees $26 billion. “Japanese stocks had declined
significantly, compared with other markets, because of the yen,
so they are recouping the declines.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. The index increased 1.5 percent to 1,196.69 yesterday
as speculation grew that Ireland will accept a bailout to rescue
indebted banks, and reports on U.S. manufacturing and jobless
claims bolstered optimism about the economy.  The Topix has declined 4.2 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 7.3 percent by the S&P 500 and 6.8 percent by the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
an average 15.3 times estimated  earnings , compared with 14.1
times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters for this story:
