Copper in London fluctuated, heading
for the biggest weekly drop in two months, on concern additional
tightening measures in China may damp demand from the biggest
consumer.  The metal for three-month delivery lost as much as 1.3
percent to $8,320 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before advancing 0.4 percent to $8,460 at 3:01 p.m. in Shanghai.
Prices have fallen 1.8 percent this week, the most since the
week ending Sept. 10. Copper for February delivery in Shanghai
closed 2.1 percent higher at 64,010 yuan ($9,644) a ton.  “Given the inflation situation in China, I don’t think the
government has rolled out all the tightening measures,” Che
Hongyun, chief metals analyst at Galaxy Futures Co., said by
phone from Beijing. “Policy signals from China and the U.S.
dollar will provide directions in the short term.”  Inflation in China may reach 3.8 percent in the fourth
quarter, the China Securities Journal reported today, citing
estimates by the State Information Center. Inflation may exceed
the government’s 3 percent target for this year, the report said
citing the agency, which is under the National Development and
Reform Commission.  Consumer prices  accelerated to 4.4 percent in October from
a year earlier, the fastest pace since September 2008. The
central bank on Oct. 19 unexpectedly raised the one-year lending
rate by 25 basis points to 5.56 percent, and lifted the deposit
rate by the same margin to 2.5 percent.  ‘Big Problem’  The country needs to raise interest rates and allow its
currency to appreciate to curb inflation, said Vincent Chan,
head of China region research at Credit Suisse Group AG in a
Bloomberg Television interview today. China has a “big
inflation problem,” he said.  China’s plans to attack inflation with subsidies, sales of
food reserves and the threat of price controls are likely to
prove insufficient, and the central bank will have to raise
interest rates further, according to a survey of economists this
week at nine banks by Bloomberg News.  “Copper’s decline earlier this week damped confidence,”
Yu Ye, an analyst at Minmetals Futures Co., said by phone from
Shenzhen. If the U.S. dollar falls, copper may recover a bit,
otherwise, it’s capped by the macro uncertainties for now, she
said.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the
euro, yen and pound, declined for a third day, falling 0.2
percent to 78.411.  Chile Strike  Miners at Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi
copper unit in northern Chile will likely continue a strike
because an increased bonus offer doesn’t meet salary demands, a
union leader said yesterday.  Miners, on strike for 14 days, are willing to resume
collective negotiations, union official Cristian Arancibia said
in an interview in Iquique, Chile. Collahuasi started sending
individual letters to miners on Nov. 17, offering a bonus of 14
million pesos ($29,096) for those who return to work by Nov. 23.
The union rejected a Nov. 5 offer that included a bonus of 11.5
million pesos plus loans of 2 million pesos.  Aluminum in London gained 0.2 percent to $2,313 a ton, zinc
rose 1.7 percent to $2,223.25 a ton, and lead increased 1.3
percent to $2,345.25 a ton. Nickel added 0.2 percent to $21,900
a ton, and tin advanced 1.2 percent to $25,399 a ton at 3:03
