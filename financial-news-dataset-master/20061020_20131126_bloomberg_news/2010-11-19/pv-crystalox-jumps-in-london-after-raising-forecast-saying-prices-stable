PV Crystalox Solar Plc  climbed as
much as 13 percent in London after the U.K. silicon-wafer maker
raised its shipments forecast and said prices for its products
were stable.  The stock rose as high as 58 pence, the most since Aug. 23,
and traded at 56.75 pence, up 11 percent, as of 10:16 a.m. local
time. That increased the company’s market value to 236 million
pounds ($379 million).  Full-year shipments are expected to total about 350
megawatts, exceeding the 320-340 megawatts forecast in August,
the Abindon, England-based manufacturer said today in a
securities filing. The company’s factories have operated at full
capacity in the second half, it said.  PV Crystalox’s average selling price for wafers in the
second half “is broadly similar” to that of the first half,
the company said.  The company’s recent expansion led to a reduction of net
cash, which will total about 50 million euros ($69 million) at
year-end, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
