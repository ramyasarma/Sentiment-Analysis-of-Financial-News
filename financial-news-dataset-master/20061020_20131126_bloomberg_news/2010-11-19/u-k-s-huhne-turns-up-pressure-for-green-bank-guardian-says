Chris Huhne , Britain’s energy and
climate change secretary, signalled criticism of Chancellor of
the Exchequer  George Osborne  and the Treasury over their
attitude to plans for a government-backed “green” investment
bank, the Guardian reported.  Speaking at a private meeting of London financiers, Huhne,
a Liberal Democrat member of the coalition government, drew an
analogy between the Treasury’s reluctance to establish an
investment bank in the full sense of the word and its vetoing of
demands for a bank to finance small companies in the 1930s, the
newspaper said.  Huhne wants a green bank, which would help to finance clean
power stations, offshore wind farms and “smart” electricity
grids, to be able to raise capital by selling state-backed
“green bonds,” facilitating early-stage investment in riskier
projects, the Guardian said.  While Huhne refrained from criticizing the Treasury
directly, the audience of financiers “was left in no doubt of
the message” he was sending, the newspaper added, without
identifying its informants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
