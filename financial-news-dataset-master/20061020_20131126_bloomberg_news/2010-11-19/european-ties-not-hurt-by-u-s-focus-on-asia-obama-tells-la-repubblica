Ties between the U.S. and its
European allies remain strong even as the government focuses
increasingly on relations with Asian nations, President Barack
Obama told daily la Repubblica in an interview.  The partnership “remains strong and deep,” Obama said,
and it’s in the interests of both the U.S. and Europe to build
strong ties to Asia.  Obama, declining to comment on Federal Reserve policy
citing central bank independence, said he’s “focused on moves
to strengthen and revive the economy,” noting that a strong
economy is “the most important contribution the U.S. can
give.”  The U.S. continues to support Turkey’s entry into the
European Union, the president told Repubblica. “We’re convinced
that a Turkey that meets conditions” for entry,’’ would be
beneficial to Europe, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
