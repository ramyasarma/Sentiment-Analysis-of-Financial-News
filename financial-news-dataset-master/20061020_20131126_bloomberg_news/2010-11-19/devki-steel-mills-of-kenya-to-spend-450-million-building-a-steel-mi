Devki Steel Mills Ltd. , a closely
held  Kenyan  company, plans to spend $450 million to build a
steel mill with a capacity of 1 million metric tons a year in
the eastern district of Taita, Chairman Raval Guru said.  The company is in talks with  Standard Chartered Plc  about a
loan to help fund construction of the mill, Guru said in a phone
interview today from Nairobi, the capital. Building will start
in March and the steel will be sold in East Africa, he said. The
first stage of the project may start operating in mid-2012 with
a capacity of 250,000 tons per year, Guru said.  “In the first phase we are trying to get about $40
million, from Standard Chartered Bank,” he said. “Once we are
under way in production we’ll surely apply for funding of the
same amount or more for the second and third phases.”  Devki Steel will contribute the rest of the funds from its
“own cash flow,” he said. Iron ore will be bought locally and
imported from South Africa, he said.  Devki Group operates three steel mills in Kenya with the
combined capacity of 250,000 tons a year, he said. The company
last week began operating a 2.2 billion-shilling ($27.5 million)
cement factory in Athi River, outside of Nairobi, with output of
1,000 tons per day, Guru said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
