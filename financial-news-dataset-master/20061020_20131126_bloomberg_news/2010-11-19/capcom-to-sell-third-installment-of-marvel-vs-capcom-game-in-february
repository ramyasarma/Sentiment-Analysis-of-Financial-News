Capcom Co.  will start overseas sales
in February of the third title in its “Marvel vs. Capcom”
video game series, aiming to sell 2 million copies.  “Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds” will go on sale
Feb. 15 in the U.S., Feb. 17 in Japan and Feb. 18 in Europe,
 Yoshiko Ikeda , a spokeswoman for the Osaka-based company, said
today by telephone. Capcom, which also produces the “Resident
Evil” series, hasn’t disclosed sales of its first two “Marvel
vs. Capcom” titles, released in Japan in 1999 and 2002.  President  Haruhiro Tsujimoto  said in September Capcom was
in talks with a “major” Chinese online game partner to enter
the world’s biggest Internet market. Online gaming in China was
worth about 27 billion yuan ($4 billion) last year, according to
Shanghai-based  IResearch .  The company last month reported first-half profit fell 40
percent to 1.78 billion yen ($21 million), citing the yen’s
surge against other major currencies for the decline. Sales rose
4.7 percent to 40.7 billion yen.  Capcom, which has fallen 17 percent this year, traded 0.6
percent lower at 1,270 yen as of 12:39 p.m. on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The benchmark Topix index rose 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
