A U.K. index of construction
expectations fell to the lowest level in 1 1/2 years in the
third quarter as government spending cuts and concern over
access to finance hurt confidence, the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors said.  The number of construction surveyors saying workloads will
decline over the next 12 months exceeded those predicting
increases by 19 percentage points, London-based RICS said in a
report today, citing a survey. That compares with 5 points in
the previous quarter and is the lowest reading since the first
quarter of 2009. The employment outlook also worsened.  The U.K.  recovery  may falter as the government implements
the largest budget squeeze since World War II, including almost
half a million public job cuts and reductions in capital
spending. RICS said the lowest sentiment readings were in the
public housing and public works sectors.  “Data shows the construction sector has rebounded more
strongly than many anticipated, but our latest survey casts
considerable doubt on whether this improvement can be
sustained,” RICS Chief Economist  Simon Rubinsohn  said in a
statement. “The collapse in public funding will inevitably have
a major impact on the sector.”  A gauge of future employment expectations among builders
declined to minus 20 in the third quarter, the lowest since the
second quarter of 2009, RICS said.  Construction accounts for about 6 percent of the U.K.
economy. RICS questioned 183 builders for the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
