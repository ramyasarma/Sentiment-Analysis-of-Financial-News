E.ON AG will start a 6.6 million-
euro ($9 million) facility to reduce methane emissions from a
dump close to Hanoi, Financial Times Deutschland said, citing
Herve Touati, managing director for carbon-sourcing, emerging
technologies and new markets at the utility’s renewable energy
unit.  The company, which wants to expand outside of Europe, is
considering building a power plant which would run on the gas
from the Vietnamese waste site, FT Deutschland cited Touati as
saying in an interview. E.ON also has several projects it could
undertake in India, the newspaper reported, citing the managing
director.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
