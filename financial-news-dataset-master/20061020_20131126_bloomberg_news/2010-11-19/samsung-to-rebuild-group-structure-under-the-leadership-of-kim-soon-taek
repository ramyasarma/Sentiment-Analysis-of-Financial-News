Samsung Group  will form a planning
office that will oversee its units, returning South Korea’s
largest family-run industrial group to the centralized business
model it abandoned two years ago.  Lee Kun Hee , who stepped down as group chairman in 2008,
ordered the recreation of a group structure so Samsung units can
better cope with a fast-changing environment, said  Soo Jeong Lee , a Samsung spokeswoman, citing chief spokesman Rhee In Yong.
Details such as the name of the new office, led by  Kim Soon Taek , 61, haven’t been decided, she said.  The move may help the founding family reclaim its grip over
a group whose units include the world’s largest maker of
televisions, memory chips and flat screens. Lee, 68, returned as
chairman of flagship unit Samsung Electronics Co. in March and
said this week he would promote his son next month.  Lee returned to Samsung after he received a presidential
pardon over a conviction of tax evasion so that he could help
South Korea’s bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. He stepped
down and dismantled the group’s central strategic planning
office in 2008 after the tax evasion charge and claims that he
breached his fiduciary duty by causing losses at Samsung Group.  Lee told reporters that he will promote his son  Lee Jae Yong , currently an executive vice president at Samsung
Electronics, during an annual management reshuffle next month, a
Samsung official said this week.  Kim is currently a vice chairman of Samsung Electronics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
