Robbie Gould  kicked three field
goals as the Chicago Bears beat the Miami Dolphins 16-0.  Gould kicked field goals in each of the first three
quarters and Matte Forte scored the only touchdown of the game
on a 2-yard run at Sun Life Stadium in Miami.  Chicago moved a half-game ahead of the Green Bay Packers
atop the National Football Conference’s North Division with a 7-
3 record, while Miami dropped to 5-5.  Tyler Thigpen  was limited to 187 yards in Miami’s first
shutout at home since Nov. 18, 2001. Thigpen, who was sacked six
times, made his first start in the National Football League
since 2008 after quarterbacks  Chad Pennington  and  Chad Henne 
were injured in a 29-17 win over the Tennessee Titans Nov. 14.  Gould kicked field goals of 46, 24 and 50 yards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
