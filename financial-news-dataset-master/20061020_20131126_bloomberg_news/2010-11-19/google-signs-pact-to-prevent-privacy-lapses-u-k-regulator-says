Google Inc.  agreed to improve its
handling of data to prevent a repeat of its Street View
vehicles’ accidental collection of information from wireless
networks, the U.K.’s privacy regulator said.  Alan Eustace , senior vice president of engineering and
research at Google, signed an agreement to improve training on
security awareness to prevent such breaches, the  Information
Commissioner’s Office  said today in a statement.  “We will be keeping a close watch on the progress Google
makes and will follow up with an extensive audit,” Information
Commissioner Christopher Graham said in the statement. “I am
very pleased to have a firm commitment from Google.”  The regulator, based in Wilmslow, England, said on Nov. 3
that Google violated Britain’s data-protection law when its
Street View mapping unit gathered personal e-mails and passwords
from unsecured networks while photographing streets. The company
has been under fire from countries including Germany, France,
Spain and Italy since it revealed the breach in May.  “We’re pleased that the ICO have concluded their
investigation and we will be working to delete the data as soon
as possible,” Laura Scott, a spokeswoman for Google in London,
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
