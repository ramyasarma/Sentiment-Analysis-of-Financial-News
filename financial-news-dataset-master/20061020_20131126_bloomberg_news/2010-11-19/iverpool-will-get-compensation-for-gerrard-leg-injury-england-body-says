Liverpool will get compensation from
the Football Association after the soccer club’s captain Steven
Gerrard was injured playing for England.  The ruling body has an insurance policy that covers the
wages of players who are hurt in international games while they
are out of action, an F.A. official said. Gerrard may be
unavailable for four weeks after hurting his hamstring in
England’s 2-1 loss to France two days ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
