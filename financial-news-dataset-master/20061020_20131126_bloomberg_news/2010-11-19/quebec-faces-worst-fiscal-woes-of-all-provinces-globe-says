Quebec faces the worst fiscal
shortfall of Canada’s provinces as it struggles with an aging
population, debt and rising health-care costs, according to a
Conference Board of Canada study, the Globe and Mail  reported .  Quebec’s revenue growth will average 4 percent over the
next 20 years, while expenditures are expected to climb by 5.4
percent annually, the newspaper said, citing the report.  Quebec’s health-care bill is set to grow by 5.9 percent
over the same period, the paper reported. That will lift health-
care costs as a share of the province’s total expenditure to
63.4 percent from 43.1 percent today, the board forecast.  Quebec Finance Minister  Raymond Bachand  said the study was
based on false assumptions and that it ignored the province’s
most recent budget, which targets eliminating Quebec’s deficit
by 2013, the Globe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
