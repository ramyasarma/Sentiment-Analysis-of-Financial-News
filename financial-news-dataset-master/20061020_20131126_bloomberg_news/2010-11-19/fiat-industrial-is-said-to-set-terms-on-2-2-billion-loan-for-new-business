Fiat Industrial SpA, the unit
being spun off by Italy’s biggest manufacturer, set terms on a
1.6 billion euros ($2.2 billion) loan to finance the new
business, two people familiar with the matter said.  The three-year revolving credit will pay initial interest
at 175 basis points more than the three-month euro interbank
offered rate, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the terms are private. The deal forms part of 4 billion
euros of financing Fiat obtained for the demerger, it said on
Nov. 15. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A spokesman for Turin-based Fiat wasn’t immediately
available. Fiat Industrial, which will combine businesses
including Iveco and CNH Global NV, will be listed on the Milan
exchange Jan. 3.  Fiat Industrial has mandated Banca IMI SpA, Barclays
Capital, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd., Credit
Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Societe Generale SA,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UniCredit SpA to arrange
the debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The transaction is fully underwritten and includes
a 2.4 billion-euro bridge loan with a one-year term that will be
replaced with bonds, according to Bloomberg data. The bonds may
be sold in the first quarter of 2011, according to two people
with knowledge of the plan.  Three-month  Euribor , an average of rates set daily by banks
and used as a borrowing benchmark, is 1.041 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
