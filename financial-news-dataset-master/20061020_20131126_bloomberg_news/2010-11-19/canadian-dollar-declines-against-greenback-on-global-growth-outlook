Canada’s dollar traded at almost the
lowest level this month versus the greenback as China raised
reserve ratio requirements for banks, discouraging demand for
assets related to economic growth.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, is poised for its second
straight weekly loss versus the greenback, heading for a 0.6
percent drop over the past five days. Crude oil, Canada’s
biggest export, fell.  “We’ve got a bit of a risk-off move overall,”  David Watt ,
senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
unit, said by phone from Toronto. “What we’re also seeing
playing out now is increasing concern over the health of the
global economic recovery.”  The Canadian currency was at C$1.0186 per U.S. dollar at
3:40 p.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0190 yesterday. It
touched C$1.0262 on Nov. 17, the weakest level since Oct. 28.  Crude oil for December delivery declined as much as 1.5
percent to $80.59 a barrel. The MSCI World Index of equities in
developed nations was little changed after earlier dropping 0.6
percent. Canada’s currency tends to rise and fall with stocks
and commodity prices.  Canadian government bonds fell, pushing the 10-year yield
up one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.13 percent.
The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June 2020 slid
10 cents to C$102.99 The  yield  touched 3.16 percent yesterday,
the highest level since Aug. 5.  Bond Performance  The nation’s sovereign debt has lost 1.6 percent in
November in what would be the worst performance since December
2009, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  China ordered banks to set aside larger reserves for the
second time in two weeks, draining cash from the financial
system to limit inflation and asset-bubble risks in the world’s
fastest-growing major economy.  “As always, the short-term movement in markets could be an
overreaction,” Watt said via e-mail. “China’s moves are meant
reorient the pace of growth, not to toss an anchor out the
back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
