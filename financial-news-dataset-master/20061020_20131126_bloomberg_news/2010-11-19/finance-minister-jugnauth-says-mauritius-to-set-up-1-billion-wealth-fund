Mauritius plans to set up a $500
million sovereign wealth fund, Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth
said in Port Louis today as he presented the annual budget.  “To ensure greater stability in the forex market, the
government is creating a sovereign wealth fund that will be
invested in a range of asset classes abroad,” Jugnauth told
parliament. The Indian Ocean island nation will use $350 million
from its foreign currency reserves and $150 million from a
Treasury foreign currency fund, which it will close, he said.  Mauritius’s economy will grow by 4.2 percent in 2011,
little changed from expansion of about 4.1 percent this year,
Jugnauth said. The budget deficit will shrink to 4.3 percent of
gross domestic product from 4.5 percent over the same period, he
said.  The government had to “adjust our tax policy and take
other revenue measures” or the deficit would have expanded to
5.4 percent of GDP, “dangerously close to the unsustainable
zone,” Jugnauth said.  The country’s 2010 current account deficit was forecast at
8.6 percent of GDP and inflation is expected to average 2.7
percent in the year, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
