Bank of America Corp. , General
Electric Co and Oracle Corp. are among the best companies on
which to use a  buy-write  strategy, which involves buying the
stock and selling a call option, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  Strategists  John Marshall  and  Maria Grant  said the strategy
is attractive because selling May call options that are about 12
percent above the stock price allows investors to gain about 6
percent in premium from the sale and profit as much as 18
percent over the next six months, according to their report
dated yesterday. They listed 50 stocks with “buy” ratings from
Goldman Sachs analysts and share-price forecasts for a gain of
at least 10 percent.  “Selling a covered call generates upfront income for
investors willing to commit to sell their position (or a portion
of their position) at a target price,” the strategists wrote.
“Buy-writes are a good way to attempt to outperform peers in a
rangebound or weak market environment if there is a requirement
to be invested. Buy-writes are also attractive for investors who
believe a stock is a longer-term buy but should be range-bound
near term.”  The New York-based strategists also recommended using the
strategy on  MGM Resorts International , Aruba Networks Inc.,
Salesforce.com Inc., CF Industries Holdings Inc. and E*Trade
Financial Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
