Kenya is expected to buy 200,000
metric tons of wheat from the U.S. over the next year after
Russia banned exports of the grain, the  Daily Nation  reported,
citing U.S. Ambassador Michael Ranneberger.  The east African country received a 50,000-ton wheat
shipment from the U.S. at Mombasa port yesterday, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said.  The U.S. expects a “record” amount of wheat purchases
from east Africa nations this year, the Daily Nation cited
Ranneberger as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
