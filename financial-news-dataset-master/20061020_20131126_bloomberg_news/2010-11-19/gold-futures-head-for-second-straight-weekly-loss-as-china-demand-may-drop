Gold fell in New York, capping a
second straight weekly loss, as moves by China to fight
inflation and slow growth eroded demand for precious metals and
raw materials.  China ordered banks to set aside larger reserves for the
second time in two weeks. The country is the biggest bullion
consumer after India. The Thompson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index
of 19 commodities fell as much as 1.4 percent. Gold has dropped
5.1 percent from a record $1,424.30 an ounce on Nov. 9.  “Any tightening efforts by China will be interpreted by
the market as an inflation-reducing event, which would take some
luster out of gold,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  Gold futures for December delivery lost 70 cents to settle
at $1,352.30 at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The metal
lost 1 percent this week and 2.3 percent last week.  The  reserve requirement  will increase 50 basis points
starting Nov. 29, China’s central bank said on its website
today. The move spurred speculation that the country also will
raise borrowing costs.  The country’s inflation rate rose to a two-year high last
month. Surging demand in China, the world’s biggest user of many
commodities, lifted the CRB index by more than 50 percent since
2001.  ‘Less Demand’  “Higher reserve requirements and the expectation of higher
rates to cool their economy means less demand for gold and other
commodities,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading
LLC in Chicago.  China bought 153.7 metric tons of the precious metal in the
third quarter, according to the producer-funded World Gold
Council. India purchased 229.5 tons.  Gold has jumped 23 percent in 2010, heading for the 10th
straight annual gain.  The rally was driven partly by “higher investment appetite
from Indian and Chinese investors,” Eily Ong, an investment
research manager at the council in London, said in an interview
earlier this week.  Still, China’s economy is “humming fast,” said
Klopfenstein of Lind-Waldock. The country’s  “nominal moves to
slow down the economy” won’t slow investment in gold, he said.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 34.5 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $27.179 an ounce. The metal has climbed 61
percent this year.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose $8.20, or 1.2
percent, to $703.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The price has surged 72 percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery added $7.20, or 0.4
percent, to $1,671.10 an ounce. The metal has gained 14 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
