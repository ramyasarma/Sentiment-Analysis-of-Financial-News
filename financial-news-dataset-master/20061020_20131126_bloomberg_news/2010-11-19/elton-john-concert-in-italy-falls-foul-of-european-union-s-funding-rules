Italian authorities must repay
720,000 euros ($985,000) in European Union funding used for a
concert featuring  Elton John  in Naples last year, the EU
regulator said.  The European Commission wrote to the authorities in Italy’s
Campania region that managed the event and to the nation’s
Economy Ministry yesterday demanding reimbursement of the money,
EU spokesman  Ton van Lierop  told reporters in Brussels today.  The concert was part of a festival that received 2.25
million euros from the European Regional Development Fund. John
entertained the concert-goers with songs including “O Sole
Mio” and “Sacrifice.”  Cultural events can fall under the scope of operational
programs, though they have to be aimed at structural, long-term
investments,  Van Lierop  said.  “Our findings are that this was a one-off project, a one-
off concert, which could not fall under the scope,” he said.  The procedure used by the previous administration to
allocate the funds for the concert was “unusual and vague”
said Giuseppe De Mita, deputy governor of the Campania region,
who oversees tourism.  “We firmly believe that European funds should be used in a
different way,” said De Mita, adding that the region has
started a probe into the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
