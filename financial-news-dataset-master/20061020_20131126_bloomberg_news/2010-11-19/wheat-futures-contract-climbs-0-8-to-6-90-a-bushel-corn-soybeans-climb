Wheat advanced for a third day,
trimming a weekly loss, on signs of increasing demand for the
U.S. crop as global supplies shrink.  The March-delivery contract gained as much as 1.2 percent
to $6.9275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The contract
traded at $6.865 a bushel at 2:50 p.m. Singapore time, narrowing
the week’s decline to 3.2 percent.  Egypt, the world’s biggest wheat buyer, ordered 175,000
metric tons of U.S. soft and hard wheat yesterday, according to
the General Authority for Supply Commodities.  “The market was buoyed by improving investor attitude
toward risk assets and news that Egypt bought 175,000 tons of
U.S. wheat for mid-January shipment,” said  Luke Mathews , a
strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.  Asian stocks rose, tracking gains in U.S. equities
yesterday, on signs that the U.S. economic recovery is
accelerating, and on optimism that a bailout for Ireland will
prevent the nation’s banking crisis from spreading.  U.S. exporters sold 943,444 tons of wheat in the week to
Nov. 11 compared with 831,989 tons a week earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. That takes outstanding
sales to 8.44 million tons so far in the marketing year from
June 1, compared with 3.97 million tons a  year ago , it said.  Export sales from the U.S., the largest shipper, are rising
amid a forecast from the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture
Organization that global output will drop 5.1 percent to 647.7
million tons in 2010-2011. That’s less than estimated demand of
668 million tons, the FAO said Nov. 17.  Inflation Steps  FAO’s forecast compares with USDA’s  estimate  on Nov. 9 that
the world harvest of 642.891 million tons will trail demand by
22.9 million tons.  Corn for March delivery was unchanged at $5.5575 a bushel
in Chicago, taking the week’s gain to 1.4 percent.  January-delivery soybeans added 0.2 percent to $12.445 a
bushel in Chicago, after swinging between gains and losses. The
contract is set for a 2 percent loss this week.  China’s steps to cool inflation are unlikely to affect U.S.
soybean sales because rising food demand in the world’s biggest
consumer will sustain exports, Philip Bradshaw, chairman of the
board, which represents U.S. soybean farmers and funds marketing
and research, said in an interview in Seoul today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
