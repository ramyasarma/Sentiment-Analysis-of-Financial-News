The euro may rebound to $1.40 should
it break through resistance levels indicated by ichimoku cloud
analysis, Ueda Harlow Ltd. said.  If the euro breaks above the $1.365 level at the top of the
cloud and beyond the conversion line of $1.3711, it may
accelerate toward $1.40, said  Toshiya Yamauchi , a senior
currency analyst in Tokyo at Ueda Harlow.  “The top of the cloud and the conversion line are current
resistance,” said Yamauchi. “Once the euro breaks these lines
and rebounds to the base line, it will try higher.” The base
line stands at $1.3865.  The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.363 as of 1:49 p.m. in
Tokyo, paring yesterday’s 0.8 percent surge on optimism Ireland
will accept a bailout for its trouble banking sector. It sank to
$1.3448 on Nov. 16, a level not seen since Sept. 28. The
currency last traded at $1.40 on Nov. 8.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows. The
conversion line plots the sum of the highest high and lowest low
over the last nine trading days. The baseline is the same
calculation over the past 26 days.  The cloud refers to the area between the first and second
leading span lines on the chart and is used to show an area
where buy orders may be clustered.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
