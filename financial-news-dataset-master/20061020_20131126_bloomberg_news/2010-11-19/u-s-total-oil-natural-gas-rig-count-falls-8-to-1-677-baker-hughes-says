Oil and natural-gas rigs operating
in the U.S. fell for the first time in four weeks, led by
declines in natural-gas drilling, according to data published by
Baker Hughes Inc.  The total rig count retreated from a 22-month high, losing
eight to 1,677. The combined oil and gas rig count rose to a 22-
year high in 2008, peaking at 2,031.  Gas rigs dropped by 19 to 936. They have fallen 5 percent
in 13 weeks. The gas rig count has dropped 42 percent from a
peak of 1,606 in September 2008.  Gas for December delivery gained 15.7 cents, or 3.9
percent, to settle at $4.164 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices posted their first
weekly increase this month on forecasts of below-normal
temperatures that may spark greater demand for the heating fuel.  Oil rigs increased by 11 to 731, the highest level since
Dec. 18, 1987. Oil for December delivery fell and posted its
biggest weekly loss in three months after China ordered banks to
raise reserves in a move that may slow growth in the world’s
largest energy-consuming country.  December crude dropped 34 cents, or 0.4 percent, to expire
at $81.51 a barrel on the Nymex. The more-active January
contract slipped 44 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $81.98.  Baker Hughes also reported that miscellaneous rigs, which
primarily drill for geothermal energy, were unchanged from the
week before at 10.  Among major producing states, rigs fell the most in
Oklahoma, where they fell by eight to 132. Louisiana rigs
dropped by five to 177, and New Mexico and  Pennsylvania  lost
three rigs each to 68 and 99, respectively. The rig count also
decreased by two in Wyoming to 43.  Texas  rigs jumped by seven to 739, and the count climbed by
two each in Arkansas, Colorado and North Dakota.  Rigs on land fell by five, or 0.3 percent, to 1,637, and
rigs in inland waters were unchanged at 20. Offshore drilling
declined by three rigs to 20, echoing the drop in the Gulf of
Mexico.  Canadian rigs also decreased by 11, or 2.6 percent, to 418.  To contact the reporter on this story:
