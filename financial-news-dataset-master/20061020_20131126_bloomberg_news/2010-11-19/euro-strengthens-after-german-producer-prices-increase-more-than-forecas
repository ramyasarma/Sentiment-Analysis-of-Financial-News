The euro rose against the dollar,
reversing an earlier decline, after a German report showed
producer prices climbed more than economists forecast.  The 16-nation currency gained 0.3 percent to $1.3678 as of
7:04 a.m. in London from yesterday in New York. It earlier fell
as much as 0.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
