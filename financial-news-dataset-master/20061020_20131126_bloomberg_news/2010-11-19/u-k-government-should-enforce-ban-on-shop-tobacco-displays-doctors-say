The  British Medical Association ,
which represents 141,000 doctors in the U.K., called on the
government to fully implement proposed rules banning the display
of tobacco products in shops.  Health Minister  Anne Milton  told lawmakers last month that
ministers are consulting over the  regulations , contained in
legislation passed by the previous government and aimed at
protecting children from tobacco advertising. Doctors say they
are concerned the rules will be watered down.  “It is essential that action is taken to help people quit
and discourage young people from starting to smoke in the first
place,” Vivienne Nathanson, the BMA’s head of science and
ethics, said in an e-mailed statement. “If the government is
truly committed to reducing health inequalities, it must fully
implement the legislation to ban tobacco displays.”  Research in Ireland after a similar ban on tobacco displays
in July 2009 shows that it changed young people’s perception of
smoking in their peer group and did not harm businesses,
Nathanson said, citing an article in the  Journal of Tobacco
Control .  “The government, in discussions across Whitehall, are
developing options around the display of tobacco in shops that
seek to ensure an appropriate balance between public health
priorities and burdens on business,” Milton  told lawmakers  on
Oct. 18.  No decisions have yet been made on the implementation of
the rules in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a spokeswoman
for the Department of Health said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
