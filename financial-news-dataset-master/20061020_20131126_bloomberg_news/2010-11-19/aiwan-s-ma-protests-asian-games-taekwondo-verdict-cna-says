Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou
protested an Asian Games’ ruling on the disqualification of a
taekwondo contestant from the island, the Central News Agency
reported today.  The accusations the competitor used illegal sensors on the
heels of her footwear weren’t acceptable, the Taipei-based news
agency cited Ma as saying. The government demands the Games’
organizers offer a reasonable explanation, the agency said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
