The U.S. Senate confirmed  Jack Lew 
as White House budget director yesterday after Louisiana
Democrat  Mary Landrieu  dropped objections that delayed the vote
for two months.  Lew was confirmed by voice vote as director of the  Office
of Management and Budget , a job he also held for three years in
the administration of President  Bill Clinton .  In a statement released before traveling to Lisbon,
Portugal, for the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  summit,
President  Barack Obama  praised Lew’s “unparalleled experience
and wisdom.”  “After years of irresponsibility in Washington, we need to
make the tough choices to put our country back on a sustainable
fiscal path and lay the foundation for long-term job creation
and economic growth,” Obama said. He said he was “confident”
Lew could “lead us in these efforts.”  Lew, who is now deputy secretary of state for management
and resources, succeeds  Peter Orszag , who resigned July 30.
 Jeffrey Zients , OMB’s deputy director, has been serving as
acting director.  Landrieu had held up Lew’s confirmation vote since
September, demanding that the Obama administration first lift
its moratorium on Gulf Coast deep-water oil drilling imposed in
the aftermath of the BP Plc oil spill. The administration did so
last month, though Landrieu continued to block consideration of
the nomination because she said she wanted to ensure that the
administration was issuing drilling permits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
