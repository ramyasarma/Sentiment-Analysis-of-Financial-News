Kenyans  living abroad sent home 13
percent more funds in September than a month earlier, the
 Central Bank of Kenya  said.  Remittances totaled $58.6 million compared with $52 million
a month earlier, research director Charles Koori said in a
statement on the bank’s website today in Nairobi, the capital.
Cumulative remittances during the nine months through September
climbed 22 percent to $461.4 million from a year earlier, he
said.  “The source markets for remittances have on average
maintained the same shares, with North America contributing 53
percent and Europe 26 percent of total remittances to Kenya in
September 2010, from the survey,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
