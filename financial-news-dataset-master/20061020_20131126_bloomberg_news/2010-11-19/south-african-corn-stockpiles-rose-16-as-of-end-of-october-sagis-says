South Africa’s corn stockpiles rose
16 percent to almost 8 million metric tons at the end of October
from 6.9 million tons a year earlier, the South African Grain
Information Service said.  The country had 5.36 million tons of white corn and 2.64
million tons of yellow corn, the company said on its website
today. White corn is used to make South Africa’s staple food,
while yellow corn is mainly used as feed.  Wheat stocks fell 10 percent to 646,000 tons from 719,000
tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
