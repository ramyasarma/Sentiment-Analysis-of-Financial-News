Investor confidence in central and
east Europe rose “significantly” in November from the previous
month as the economic outlook improved in the region, according
to an index published by the ZEW  Center for European Economic
Research  and  Erste Group Bank AG .  The index of investor and analyst expectations rose 12.1
points to 31.4 points, according to the report today. The Czech
Republic’s index rose 19.1 points to 30.9 points, the biggest
monthly gain. Hungary’s index rose 10.1 points to 36.4, the
highest value among the eight countries surveyed.  Economic growth in most of east Europe is accelerating
after recessions following the global financial crisis. The
economies of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania will
expand a combined 1.8 percent this year and 3.2 percent in 2011,
the World Bank said yesterday. Latvia and Romania are the only
economies in the region forecast to contract in 2010.  The ZEW index is based on surveys for Austria, Croatia,
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Turkey.
It reflects the difference between the percentage of analysts
who have positive outlooks and those with negative views.
Ratings range from a maximum of 100 points to a minimum of minus
100 points.  Austria’s index rose 6.3 points to 20.1, while Croatia’s
increased 12.6 points to 26.4 and Poland’s by 14.2 points to
32.5. Romania’ was 12 points higher at 31.6. Slovakia advanced
7.7 points to 25 and Turkey’s index rose 5.8 points to 26.7,
according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
