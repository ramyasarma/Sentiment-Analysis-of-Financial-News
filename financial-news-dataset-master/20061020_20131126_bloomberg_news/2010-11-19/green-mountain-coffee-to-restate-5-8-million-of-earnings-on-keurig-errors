Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. 
said it will restate earnings, lowering them by about $5.8
million, for the periods dating back to 2007 after it discovered
errors associated with its Keurig single-cup coffee business.  About $3.5 million is for overstated net income in the
first three quarters of fiscal 2010, the Waterbury, Vermont-
based company said in a statement today. The errors included
misreporting of the cost of K-Cup coffee pods in inventory,
marketing expenses for brewers and changes in how the company
recognized royalties of K-cups, according to the statement.  Green Mountain  shares  have more than quadrupled in the past
three years as the company expanded its Keurig business, which
markets machines that make single cups of coffee with pods
called K-cups. Keurig generated more than 50 percent of the
coffee roaster’s  sales  in the year ended September 2009,
according to company filings.  Green Mountain said Sept. 29 that the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s enforcement division was investigating how
the company recognizes revenue. The company said it started its
own probe and is cooperating with regulators.  A representative of the company didn’t immediately return a
telephone call today seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
