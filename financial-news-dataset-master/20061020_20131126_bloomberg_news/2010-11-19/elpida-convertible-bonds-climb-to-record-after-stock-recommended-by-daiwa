Elpida Memory Inc. ’s convertible
bonds climbed to a record following their sale last month after
Daiwa Securities Group Inc. recommended the stock of the world’s
third-largest maker of computer-memory chips.  The 0.5 percent notes rose 1.3 percent to 103.7 yen for 100
yen of face value in Tokyo today, according to Tokyo Stock
Exchange prices. The bonds rose for a second day, after falling
to as low as 95 yen on Nov. 4.  Elpida shares gained 5.7 percent today to 989 yen, the
highest since Sept. 8, after the company was raised to
“outperform” from “neutral” by Daiwa analyst  Masaharu Sato .  The Japanese chipmaker, bailed out last year by the
government, sold 60 billion yen ($719 million) of five-year
convertible bonds at 102.5 percent of face value with a
conversion premium of 33.99 percent, or a share price of 1,222
yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The rise is “a reflection of Elpida’s share price,” said
 Keita Wakabayashi , a Tokyo-based analyst at Mito Securities Co.
“Demand for components used in personal computers is rising,
which is boosting the stock as well as the price of convertible
bonds.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
