Nestle SA , the world’s largest food
company, said a change to its sales-recognition policy next year
will boost profit margins and reduce revenue figures.  The accounting change will put Nestle in line with
International Financial Reporting Standards starting in January,
the Vevey, Switzerland-based company said today on its  website .
Discounts and promotions will be deducted from  sales , reducing
revenue by about 15 percent, Nestle said. The shift won’t affect
net income, earnings per share or the  balance sheet , it said.  Nestle posted sales of 108 billion Swiss francs ($109
billion) last year. Investors wanted Nestle to adopt the change
to make it easier to compare the KitKat maker with rivals,
 Andrew Wood , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a
report on Feb. 18.  Nestle also said today that  Patrice Bula  will replace
 Petraea Heynike  as head of strategic business units, Marketing,
sales and the Nespresso coffee brand. Heynike, born in 1947,
will retire at the end of April after 38 years with the Swiss
manufacturer.  Bula, 54, is market head for Nestle’s greater China region
and has worked for the company for 30 years, Nestle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
