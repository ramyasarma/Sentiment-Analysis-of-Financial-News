Edward Devlin , a portfolio manager
at Pacific Investment Management Co., said the fund is “long-
term bullish” on the Canadian dollar, though there could be
volatility in the short-term because of policy-driven
“distortions” coming primarily from the U.S. and China.  Devlin, in an article published today on Pimco’s  website ,
said the country should benefit as investors turn to “hard”
commodities. Devlin cited risks associated with any potential
drop in commodity prices, the effects of a higher Canadian
dollar fueled by monetary and currency policies in China and the
U.S., and sovereign credit problems in other countries.  “While we are long-term bullish on the Canadian dollar, we
recognize that there will be substantial short-term volatility
as policy-driven distortions take place,” Devlin wrote.  Devlin recommended the country maintain a “prudent”
fiscal policy, limit the size of government in markets and focus
on “market-oriented, pro-growth tax policies” to create jobs.  Canada should consider using regulations to stem any
distortions in asset prices and maintain the confidence of
investors in part by laying out a “consistent framework” for
foreign investments, according to Devlin, who said Canada’s
recent decision to block BHP Billiton Ltd.’s proposed takeover
of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. has “many investors
concerned.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
