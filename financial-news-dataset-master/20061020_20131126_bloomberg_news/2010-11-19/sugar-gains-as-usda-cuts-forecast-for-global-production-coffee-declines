Sugar fell the most in a week in New
York on concern that demand for commodities may decline in China
after the government asked banks to set aside more reserves as
it tries to curb inflation. Coffee and cocoa fell.  The People’s Bank of China will increase the ratio
requirement for the nation’s banks by 50 basis points starting
Nov. 29, according to its website. The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index  of 19 raw materials declined as much as 1.3 percent,
led by cotton and sugar. On Nov. 12, sugar prices plunged 12
percent, the most since July 1988, partly on concern that China
would raise lending rates.  “It’s China that is putting pressure on the commodity
markets,” said  Carlos Costa , a risk-management consultant at
FCStone Group Inc. in Campinas, Brazil. “The fundamentals for
sugar have not changed, so the fall is temporary.”  Raw sugar for March delivery plunged 1.2 cents, or4.3
percent, to 26.93 cents a pound at 10:46 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. The commodity has gained 2.7 percent this
week, after plunging 17 percent in the previous week.  Still, prices have more than doubled since reaching a 13-
month low in May on concern that adverse weather will lower
output in Brazil, the biggest producer, as well as China and
Russia.  Global Production  Global production will be 161.9 million metric tons in the
2010-2011 crop year, below a May estimate of 163.8 million tons,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. For most countries, the
crop year starts Oct. 1. The estimated surplus was cut to 3
million tons from 6.2 million tons.  “Prices are increasing due to tightening supply and to
appreciation of the Brazilian real,” the USDA said.  “It is always important to follow the currencies of the
main producers,” said  Connor Noonan , an analyst at Castlestone
Management Ltd. in London. “If the dollar is dropping relative
to the Brazilian real, exporters will need much higher prices.”  The real has strengthened 35 percent versus the dollar
since the start of 2009.  Output in India, the world’s second-largest producer, may
total 24.5 million metric tons in the year that began Oct. 1,
K.V. Thomas, a junior agriculture minister, said today, less
than the Nov. 11 government estimate of 25 million tons.  The country may consume 22.5 million to 23 million tons,
Thomas said.  In London, refined sugar for March delivery fell $29.60, or
4.2 percent, to $679.10 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Yesterday, the
sweetener gained 5.7 percent, the biggest increase for a most-
active contract since Oct. 29, 2008.  Coffee Falls  Arabica coffee for March delivery fell 2.6 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.087 a pound on ICE in New York. Before today, the
most-active contract jumped 55 percent this year. Robusta coffee
for January delivery declined $11, or 0.6 percent, to $1,900 a
ton on NYSE Liffe.  Coffee production in Kenya, which grows mostly Arabica
beans, may rise as much as 15 percent in the year that began
Oct. 1 because of improved weather, according to the Coffee
Board of Kenya. Output may range from 49,000 to 55,000 tons,
James Wahome, quality manager at the board, said today.  Arabica coffee is grown mostly in Latin America and brewed
by specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta beans,
used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly in Asia and parts
of Africa.  Cocoa for March delivery fell $36, or 1.2 percent, to
$2,903 in New York, after two days of gains. In London, cocoa
futures for March delivery dropped 19 pounds, or 1 percent to
1,912 pounds ($3,045) a ton.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery slid 0.65 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $1.522 a pound in New York, falling for the
third time in four days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
