Kia Motors Corp. , South Korea’s
 second-biggest automaker , expects its sales in Latin America to
increase 75 percent this year, helped by demand for Picanto and
Cerato cars and Sportage sport-utility vehicles.  Kia, based in Seoul, predicts sales  in the region  to rise
to 136,000 vehicles in 2010, compared with 77,688 units sold
last year, the company said in a statement. Kia’s market share
in the region may increase to 2.4 percent from 1.5 percent, it
said today.  The automaker, which began selling cars in Latin America 33
years ago, is targeting Brazil where it plans to sell around
53,000 cars this year, more than double last year’s sales,
according to the statement. It recently introduced  Soul Flex 
vehicles, fueled by gasoline and ethanol, in the nation.  Kia rose 1.8 percent to 51,600 won in Seoul trading. The
stock has more than doubled in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
