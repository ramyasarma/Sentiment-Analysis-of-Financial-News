Gold may rise as concern about
Ireland’s debt woes spurs demand for a protection of wealth, a
survey found.  Twelve of 19 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 63 percent, said the metal will gain next week.
Four predicted lower prices and three were neutral. Gold futures
for December delivery were down 1.1 percent for this week at
$1,351 an ounce at 11 a.m. yesterday on the Comex in New York.
Futures reached a record $1,424.30 on Nov. 9.  The Irish central-bank governor, Patrick Honohan, said he
expects the country to ask for a “substantial” bailout from
the European Union and International Monetary Fund to rescue its
debt-laden banks. Concern earlier this year that Greece may go
bankrupt helped push gold to then-record prices.  The metal may advance “if matters get worse in the euro
zone and investors scramble for the safety of bullion,” said
 Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London. “The
downside will remain limited for now, with currency risk still
at the head of investors’ agenda.”  The attached chart tracks the results of the Bloomberg
survey, with the red bars derived by subtracting bearish
forecasts from bullish estimates. Readings below zero signal
that most respondents expect a decline. The green line shows the
gold price. The data are as of Nov. 12.  The weekly gold survey that started six years ago has
forecast prices accurately in 193 of 337 weeks, or 57 percent of
the time.  This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 12  Bearish : 4  Neutral : 3  To contact the reporter on this story:
