Total SA could be forced to quit
Nigeria if the security situation deteriorates further, Chief
Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said today.  “If it gets worse, we may have to leave,” he told an
investor conference in Paris today.  Three Total workers who were kidnapped in Nigeria have
since been freed. “We don’t have many employees kidnapped” in
Nigeria, the CEO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
