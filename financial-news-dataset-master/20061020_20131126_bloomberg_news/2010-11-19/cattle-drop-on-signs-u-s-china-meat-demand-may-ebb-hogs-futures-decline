Cattle futures extended a rally to a
26-month high on speculation that U.S. meatpacker demand will
rise next week as consumers boosts purchases of meat before
holiday celebrations at the end of the year. Hogs also gained.  Wholesale  choice beef  rebounded at midday to $1.5901 a
pound after dropping yesterday for the first time in five
sessions, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Retailers
probably will begin stocking up soon for the Christmas and New
Year’s Day holidays, said  Doug Houghton , an analyst with Brock
Associates in Milwaukee.  “Packers will need some cattle coming out of the
Thanksgiving holiday” in the U.S. on Nov. 25, Houghton said.
“They’re going to be strong buyers next week.”  Cattle futures for February delivery gained 0.525 cent, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $1.05025 a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1.052,
the highest for a most-active contract since Sept. 16, 2008. The
commodity gained 3.3 percent this week and is up 22 percent this
year.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 1.35
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $1.174 a pound.  Earlier, cattle prices fluctuated before a USDA report on
inventories. Feedlots purchased 2.504 million young animals last
month, up 1.2 percent from a year earlier, the agency said after
pit trading closed in Chicago. Analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey expected little changed.  The total feedlot herd on Nov. 1 increased by 3.2 percent,
compared with a 2.9 percent gain projected by analysts.  Hog Market  Hog futures for February settlement rose 1.05 cents, or 1.4
percent, to 76.85 cents a pound. Earlier, the price reached
77.05 cents, the highest since Sept. 28.  Wholesale pork climbed 0.3 percent yesterday to 76.6 cents
a pound, according to the USDA. By tomorrow, packers will have
processed 2.326 million hogs this week, 0.6 percent more than a
week earlier, the USDA estimates.  “Packers have very good margins, and they’re having no
trouble finding hog supplies,” Houghton said.  Earlier, hog futures dropped as much as 0.6 percent on
speculation that demand will ebb from China, the world’s largest
pork consumer. China ordered banks to set aside larger reserves,
draining cash from the financial system, to limit the fastest
inflation in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
