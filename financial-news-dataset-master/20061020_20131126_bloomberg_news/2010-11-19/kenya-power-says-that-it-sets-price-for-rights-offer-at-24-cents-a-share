Kenya Power & Lighting Co. , the
nation’s sole electricity distributor, will sell shares to
existing shareholders at 19.50 shillings ($0.24) a share from
Dec. 1.  The rights offer, which forms part of a capital
reorganization that also includes an eight-for-one share split
and the conversion of preference stock into ordinary shares,
will close on Dec. 23, the Nairobi-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The program received regulatory approval yesterday from
Kenya’s Capital Markets Authority, which said the new KPLC stock
will begin trading on the Nairobi Stock Exchange on Jan. 24.  KPLC plans to raise as much as 10 billion shillings from
the process, Managing Director  Joseph Njoroge  said on Oct. 28.
The funds will be invested in the refurbishment and development
of the country’s power-distribution network, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
