Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  may
survive a confidence vote in Italy’s parliament next month as
some legislators who broke away from his ruling party along with
ex-ally  Gianfranco Fini  have decided to support the premier, la
Repubblica reported, without saying how it got the information.  Deputies and Senators from Fini’s new Future and Liberty
Party may vote in favor of Berlusconi even after their leader
demanded that the prime minister resign, the newspaper said.
Berlusconi may have enough backers in both houses of parliament
when members vote on a confidence measure Dec. 14, Repubblica
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
