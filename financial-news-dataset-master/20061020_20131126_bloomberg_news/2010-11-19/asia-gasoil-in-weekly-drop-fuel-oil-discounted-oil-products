Asia gasoil, or diesel, was set for
the first weekly drop in a month even as refiners in China, the
world’s biggest energy user, boosted imports because of a supply
shortage. Fuel oil’s discount to crude widened.  Oil futures, trading below $82 a barrel in New York, headed
for the largest weekly loss since August amid speculation a
European Union-led bailout of Ireland won’t be enough to
stabilize sovereign-debt concerns in the region.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil  swaps for December were unchanged at 1:45 p.m. in
Singapore, Asia’s biggest oil-trading hub, after falling
yesterday to $95.75 a barrel according to data from PVM Oil
Associates, a brokerage. Prices are down 3.3 percent this week,
after rising 7.1 percent in the previous three weeks.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. will increase diesel
imports from this month as a surge in demand depleted 2,000
retail fuel stations in eastern and southern provinces,
according to its parent company. PetroChina Co. will also import
more, the official Xinhua News agency said.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, the Asian benchmark,
dropped 73 cents to $12.97 a barrel, PVM data showed. This  crack
spread , a measure of refining profit, was at the lowest since
Nov. 8.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising
yesterday to $1 a barrel, PVM said. The  regrade  has fallen from
$1.30 at the end of October, meaning it’s less profitable to
produce aviation fuel compared with diesel.  Fuel Oil  December  high-sulfur fuel oil  swaps rebounded $3.50, or 0.7
percent, to $487 a metric ton, snapping a four-day losing streak,
according to PVM. The  discount  to Dubai crude widened 19 cents
to $7.86 a barrel, indicating losses from making the residue
were the largest since Nov. 4.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to the 380-
centistoke grade was unchanged after dropping to $9.75 a ton,
based on PVM data. This  viscosity spread  has narrowed from $11
at the end of October, signaling bunker, or marine fuel, has
risen more than higher-quality fuel oil.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for second-half December delivery were bid at $804.25
a ton against offers at $807.25, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. That’s up from $789.50, the lowest
close since Nov. 3.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha slumped yesterday to $3.40 a
barrel, the narrowest since Nov. 2, Bloomberg calculations
showed. A declining reforming margin shows motor fuel is less
profitable compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
