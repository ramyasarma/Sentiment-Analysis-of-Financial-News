Japanese  bonds  fell this week as
rising stocks reduced demand for government debt as a refuge and
after a government report showed third-quarter gross domestic
product grew more than economists predicted.  Benchmark 10-year  yields  completed the longest stretch of
weekly gains in more than four years as the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average rose past 10,000 for the first time since June. Bonds
also slumped after demand fell at a 1.1 trillion-yen ($13.2
billion) sale of 20-year debt on Nov. 18.  “I expect Japan’s economy to improve and declines in
consumer prices to narrow, boosting bond yields gradually,”
said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee about $17 billion as
chief strategist in Tokyo at Toyota Asset Management Co. “Once
an economic recovery is confirmed, 10-year yields will advance
toward 1.2 percent.”  The  yield  on the 10-year bond jumped 9.5 basis points this
week to 1.07 percent in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1 percent security
due September 2020 fell 0.846 yen to 99.378. The yield posted a
sixth weekly increase that’s the longest streak since April 2006.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery lost 0.83 to
141.76 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Japan’s  gross domestic product  rose an annualized 3.9
percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, the Cabinet Office
said on Nov. 15. Economists had estimated a 2.5 percent increase.  The  Nikkei 225  jumped 3.1 percent this week to 10,022.39,
the highest close since June 22. The yen slid to as low as 83.79
per dollar on Nov. 18, the weakest since Oct. 5. A weaker yen
increases the value of exporters’ overseas sales.  ‘Bearish Trend’  “We suspect this bearish trend on 10-year Japanese
government bonds has some room to go as it seems driven by” the
yen and Japanese equities,  Christian Carrillo , head of Asia-
pacific interest rates strategy at Societe Generale SA in Tokyo,
wrote in a report.  Japan’s auction of 20-year debt on Nov. 18 drew bids valued
at 2.54 times the amount on offer, the least since December 2009.
The lowest accepted price was 99.70, less than the 99.90
estimated by traders in a Bloomberg survey.  Ten-year yields may resume declines next year toward levels
last seen in 2003 as deflation persists and the central bank is
pressed to ease monetary policy further,  Takehiro Sato , chief
economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., said in an
interview. Yields will slide to about 0.8 percent by March 2011,
according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
