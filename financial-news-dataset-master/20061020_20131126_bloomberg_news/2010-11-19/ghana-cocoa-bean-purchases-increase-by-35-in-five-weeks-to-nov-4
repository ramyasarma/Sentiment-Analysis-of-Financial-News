Cocoa purchases in  Ghana , the
world’s second-biggest producer of the beans, rose 35 percent in
the five weeks of the season to Nov. 4, according to a
government official with access to the information.  Companies licensed by the Ghana Cocoa Board to purchase
beans from farmers bought 275,487 metric tons during the period,
compared with 204,626 tons a year earlier, the data show. The
official declined to be identified because the figures are
confidential.  Purchases during the week ended Nov. 4 increased to 46,860
tons from 44,709 tons in the fifth week of the 2009-10 season.
Ghana borders Ivory Coast, the world’s top producer of the
chocolate ingredient.  To contact the reporter on this story:
