The Kenyan central bank’s decision
to let unsuccessful bids help determine the coupon on its five-
year bond may create “upward bias” in the rate, according to
Sterling Investment Bank Ltd..  “This position exposes the offer to upward bias coming
from very aggressive bidders,” Peter Mwirigi and  Fred Moturi ,
fixed-income dealers at the Nairobi-based company, wrote in an
e-mailed note to clients dated today. “A strategy of using the
weighted average yield to maturity as the coupon seems fair.”  Kenya, East Africa’s biggest economy, started the sale of
12 billion shillings ($149 million) of five-year bonds on Nov.
14 and will use the proceeds of the sale to support its budget.  “We expect an oversubscription due to the high prevailing
liquidity,” with aggressive bids rates of 7.0 percent and
conservative bids of 6.1 percent, Moturi said in a separate
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
