Emergency services are on their way
to the  Pike River Coal Co . mine on the west coast of New Zealand
after an explosion, police said.  Reports say an explosion was heard around 4:30 p.m. local
time, with workers known to be in the mine at the time,
according to a statement on the New Zealand Police  website . As
many as 30 workers could have been underground, stuff.co.nz
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Pike River, which mines near Greymouth on the country’s
South Island, is part-owned by India’s Gujarat NRE Coke Ltd. and
Saurashtra Fuels Pvt. who are also contracted to take part of
its low-ash, low-phosphorus coking coal.  Mining employs about 6,000 people in New Zealand, according
to government website  www.beehive.govt.nz . The industry earned
about NZ$1.1 billion ($850 million) of export receipts in 2009,
it said.  Pike River shares fell 14 percent to 61 Australian cents in
Sydney before they were halted from trading. The stock fell 4.4
percent to 88 New Zealand cents at the 5 p.m. market close in
Wellington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
