U.S. diesel consumption increased in
October from a year earlier, a signal that the U.S. economy is
rebounding, according to the American Petroleum Institute.  Demand for ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, rose 8.4 percent to average 3.19 million barrels a day
last month, the industry-funded group said today in a report.
Consumption during the first 10 months of 2010 climbed 2.9
percent to 2.97 million barrels a day.  “We’ve been watching the diesel demand numbers, which have
been very strong,”  John Felmy , chief economist with the
Washington-based API, said in a telephone interview. “There’s a
strong correlation between diesel consumption and economic
growth. This is clearly a good sign for the economy.”  Use of distillate fuel, a category that includes diesel and
heating oil, rose 4 percent to 3.8 million barrels a day in
October. Demand climbed 3.4 percent to 3.74 million barrels a
day during the first 10 months of the year.  Deliveries of gasoline increased 0.6 percent to 9.04
million barrels a day in October, the report showed. Consumption
during the first 10 months of the year averaged 9.02 million
barrels a day, up 0.1 percent from the same period in 2009.  Jet-fuel use surged 17 percent to an average 1.6 million
barrels a day. Daily demand averaged 1.45 million barrels
through October, up 3.2 percent.  Total deliveries of petroleum products averaged 19 million
barrels a day in October, up 1.3 percent, the report showed.  U.S. crude-oil production rose 0.1 percent to an average
5.51 million barrels a day in October. Output in the lower 48
states increased 0.2 percent to 4.85 million barrels a day.
Alaskan production slipped 0.6 percent to 654,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
