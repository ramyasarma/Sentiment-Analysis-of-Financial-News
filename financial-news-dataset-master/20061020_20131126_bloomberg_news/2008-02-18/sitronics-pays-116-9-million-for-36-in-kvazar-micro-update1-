             OAO Sitronics, Russian billionaire
 Vladimir Yevtushenkov 's electronics unit, will pay $116.9 million
to increase its stake in its Kvazar-Micro unit to 87 percent.  
 Sitronics will buy 36 percent of Kvazar-Micro, a provider of
computer services and products, from Melrose Holding Co. and
plans to buy the remaining 13 percent within two years, the
Moscow-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 ``The acquisition of the remaining stakes in Kvazar-Micro
will take us to the next level in consolidation of our assets and
creation of a unified company with the higher efficiency
levels,'' Sitronics Chief Executive Officer Sergei Aslanyan said
in the statement.  
 Sitronics, which also has telecommunications and consumer
electronics businesses, anticipates sales will rise at least 20
percent this year, helped by growing demand for information-
technology services. Sitronics is financing the acquisition
through cash and stock.  
 Melrose Holding, which is controlled by Sitronics board
director and former Chief Executive Officer Yevgeny Utkin, will
hold 3.07 percent in Sitronics, a stake worth $38.9 million at
Friday's closing price.
