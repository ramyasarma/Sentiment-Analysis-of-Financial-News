             China was a net exporter of coal in
January after imports from  Australia  and  Indonesia  were
disrupted by floods.  
 The world's biggest coal producer increased exports by 75
percent last month to 5.8 million metric tons, according to
data from the Customs General  Administration of China  today.
Imports fell 9.9 percent to 4.24 million tons, the customs said
Feb. 15.  
 Producers in Australia and Indonesia missed deliveries last
month as output fell because of heavier-than-usual rains.
Benchmark thermal coal prices rose to a record $139.16 a ton
last week at Australia's Newcastle port, according to the
globalCOAL NEWC Index.  
 ``Shipments from Australia have been disrupted and imports
from Indonesia have been affected as well because of the rainy
season,'' Wang Guangju, a coal analyst with Huatai Securities
Co., said by telephone in the eastern city of Nanjing.  
 Xstrata Plc, the world's biggest exporter of thermal coal,
last week advised customers of delays to deliveries from two
mines in Australia's Queensland. Coal-rail transportation on
both the Newlands and Goonyella networks in central Queensland
was halted on Jan. 18 by flooding, Australian Associated Press
reported in January.  
 China  increased oil-products exports by 30 percent to 1.2
million tons last month, it said. Imports rose 17 percent to
3.23 million tons, customs data showed on Feb. 15.
