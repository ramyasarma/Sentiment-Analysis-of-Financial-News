             OAO Gazprom Neft (SIBN) , the crude oil unit
of  Russia 's natural gas export monopoly, is raising $1 billion
from loans to refinance existing debt and finance its business,
according to a banker involved in the transaction.  
 The Moscow-based company will borrow $500 million for three
years at an interest rate of 1.5 percentage points over the
London interbank offered  rate , or Libor, said the banker, who
declined to be identified before the transaction is complete.
Gazprom Neft will pay 1.75 percentage points over Libor on a
five-year portion, also $500 million in size.  
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
Ltd.,  Barclays Capital , Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and WestLB
AG are arrange the borrowing, Gazprom Neft said in an e-mailed
statement on May 27.  
 The banks started syndicating the loan to a wider group of
investors yesterday, the banker said.
