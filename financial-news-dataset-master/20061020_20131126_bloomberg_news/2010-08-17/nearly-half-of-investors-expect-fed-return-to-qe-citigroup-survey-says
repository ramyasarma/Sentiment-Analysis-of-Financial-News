             Almost half of investors surveyed by
Citigroup Inc. this month expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to
resume buying Treasuries with new money to help re-ignite the
economy.  
 About 40 percent of respondents said they expect the Fed to
set interest rates on excess reserves to zero, while about 35
percent predict a hardening of language on how long policy
makers will keep rates on hold,  Neela Gollapudi , a strategist at
Citigroup Global Markets in New York, wrote in an e-mailed note
dated yesterday.  
 Approximately one third of respondents expect a trade
“spat” with China with a consequent effect on rates, Citigroup
said.
