Hong Kong  stocks  fell, erasing
earlier gains, as developers tumbled on government measures to
restrain the city’s housing market.  Henderson Land Development Co. , the builder controlled by
billionaire  Lee Shau-kee , slid 3.4 percent after the city’s
Chief Executive Officer Donald Tsang announced measures to rein
in house prices.  Sino Land Co. , a Hong Kong developer controlled
by billionaire  Robert Ng , dropped 3.1 percent.  The  Hang Seng Index  fell 0.3 percent to 23,056.29 as of
11:59 a.m. local time, after rising as much as 0.9 percent.
About as many stocks fell as rose on the 45-member gauge.  Tsang said the government will temporarily remove real
estate from investments that help outsiders gain residency.
Tsang also said the government would provide apartments for
residents in a rent-to-own scheme.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies gained 0.2 percent to 13,006.09.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. , China’s biggest cement maker,
surged 5.6 percent after the Chinese government earlier said it
plans to boost sales of construction materials and cement in
rural areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
