Russian stocks approached their
highest level this year as oil and metals advanced, boosting the
outlook for commodity producers in the world’s biggest energy
exporter.  OAO Raspadskaya , the Russian coking coal miner, gained 2
percent ahead of a third-quarter trading update due today.  OAO
Sberbank , the nation’s largest lender, increased 1.3 percent.
Oil producer  OAO Lukoil  added 1.5 percent, helping push the
Micex Index of 30 stocks higher by 1.1 percent to 1,494.38 at
12:22 p.m. in Moscow. The gauge climbed for the eighth day in
the past ten and is nearing this year’s high of 1,530.93,
reached on April 15.  Oil, Russia’s main export, rose as much as 1.4 percent to
$82.82 a barrel after the International Energy Agency raised its
global demand forecast and China reported crude imports reached
a record. Copper climbed as much as 0.8 percent to $8,415 a ton
on the London Metal Exchange, the highest price since July 2008.
OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, Russia’s largest miner, gained 1.1
percent. Lead, tin, zinc, nickel and steel all rose on the LME.  “We are closing in on a psychologically important yearly
high,”  John Heisel , an equity sales trader at Citigroup Inc. in
Moscow, said by phone. “If crude and metals’ strength keep up,
we will pierce it before long.”  OAO Seventh Continent  had its biggest intraday gain in week
after Vedomosti said the Russian food retailer’s owner,
 Alexander Zanadvorov , agreed to buy a 21.3 percent stake from
lawmaker Vladimir Gruzdev’s family fund for about $400 million.  The shares climbed as much as 9.8 percent and last traded
up 4.6 percent at 298 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
