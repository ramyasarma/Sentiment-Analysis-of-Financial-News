Fredi Gonzalez  will succeed  Bobby Cox  as manager of the Atlanta Braves, the  Atlanta Journal-
Constitution  reported.  Gonzalez has been the favorite for the job since he was
fired as manager of the Florida Marlins in June, the newspaper
said, citing two unidentified people familiar with the
negotiations. Cox announced a year ago that 2010 would be his
last season, and he managed his final Major League Baseball game
two nights ago as the Braves were eliminated from the National
League Division Series by the San Francisco Giants.  Gonzalez, 46, is a former third-base coach for the Braves
and managed their top minor-league club. He was  276-279  in 3½
seasons with the Marlins, including a 35-36 record this year. He
and his family have a year-round home in the Atlanta area, the
Journal-Constitution said.  Cox, 69, managed the Braves for a total of  25 years ,
including the last 21. He led the team to 15 postseason berths,
including the World Series championship in 1995.
