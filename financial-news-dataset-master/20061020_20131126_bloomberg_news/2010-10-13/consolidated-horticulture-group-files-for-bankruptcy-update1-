Consolidated Horticulture Group LLC,
a nursery operator that supplies  Home Depot Inc. ,  Lowe’s Cos. 
and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , filed for bankruptcy protection from
creditors along with its affiliate  Hines Nurseries .  The Irvine, California-based company blamed a decline in
sales for the bankruptcy. It listed $179.3 million in assets and
$86.7 million in debt as of the end of the second quarter in
court papers filed in Wilmington, Delaware. Hines emerged from
an earlier bankruptcy in 2009.     The revenue decline is the
result of “weak consumer demand,” “anemic homebuilding
activity,” “pricing pressure” from customers and “inventory
imbalances” leading to shortage of critical crops, company
Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Thigpen  said in a court filing.  The group, with about $123 million in sales last year, has
about 900 employees producing more than 5,000 varieties of
plants, with eight nurseries in Arizona, California, Oregon and
Texas, according to court documents. The company says it is one
of the largest commercial plant  nursery operations  in North
America.  The company said in a statement it has obtained a
$5 million loan to help it reorganize.  Black Diamond Capital Management LLC purchased Hines
Nurseries Inc. in a bankruptcy sale in January 2009.  The new case is In re Consolidated Horticulture Group LLC,
10-13308, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington). The prior case was In re Hines Horticulture Inc.,
08-11922, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
