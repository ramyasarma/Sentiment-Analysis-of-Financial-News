UniCredit SpA is likely to name
Roberto Nicastro general manager and Paolo Fiorentino chief
operating officer, Il Sole 24 Ore reported, without saying how
it obtained the information.  That would leave the third deputy chief executive officer,
Sergio Ermotti, in his current role of overseeing corporate and
investment banking, the financial daily said today. The bank is
likely to hold a board meeting to approve the appointments
tomorrow or the day after, according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
