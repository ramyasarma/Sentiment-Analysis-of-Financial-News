Sugar in London and New York rose to
the highest prices since February on concerns that adverse
weather will reduce supplies from producing countries.  Sugar shipments from Thailand, the second-largest exporter,
will decline 20 percent in the year starting Dec. 1 from a year
earlier, to 4.7 million metric tons, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s attaché said Oct. 11. Brazil, the world’s largest
producer, will see a sugar-cane harvest of 639 million tons in
the marketing year started May 1, 3.2 percent lower than a
previous estimate, the USDA attaché in Sao Paulo said last week.
A four-month drought damaged crops in the country’s biggest
producing region, the South Central area.  “The market remains very tight, the Thai crop estimations
are getting reduced,” and exports could drop as low as 4
million tons,  Jonathan Bouchet , a Geneva-based trader at OTCex
Group, said in an e-mail today. “There is not enough sugar to
sustain the demand out of Brazil. I believe the market could
definitely hit 30 cents by December.”  White, or refined, sugar futures for December delivery
climbed $7.30, or 1.1 percent, to $705 a ton on NYSE Liffe at
9:59 a.m. in London. Prices touched $706 earlier today, the
highest since Feb. 22.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.48 cent, or 1.8
percent, to 27.93 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Prices jumped to 27.97 cents earlier today, the highest price
since Feb. 5.  A La Nina event, which has brought wet weather to Australia
and drought to Brazil, has strengthened, according to
Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology.  Cocoa Climbs  Record rain is slowing sugar-cane harvesting in Australia,
the third-largest exporter. Output may drop by 4.5 percent to
4.2 million tons because of the rains, Brisbane-based producer
group Canegrowers said Oct. 4.  Robusta coffee for January delivery fell $4, or 0.2
percent, to $1,683 a ton in London. In New York, arabica coffee
for December delivery rose 1.85 cents, or 1 percent, to $1.8755
a pound.  Cocoa futures for December delivery advanced 0.5 percent to
1,923 pounds ($3,050) a ton in London. The chocolate ingredient
for December delivery rose $29, or 1 percent, to $2,879 a ton in
