Fujita Corp. dropped plans to bid on
a Japanese government project to build a facility to dispose of
abandoned chemical weapons in China after the detention of four
of its employees, Nikkei English News said, citing Tatsuro
Tsuchiya, a Fujita director.  The Japanese contractor had aimed to win an order to build
a processing facility in Shijiazhuang, and had also been
preparing to bid on a mobile facility, the report said.  Four Fujita employees were detained last month for
allegedly videotaping military targets. They were later
released.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
