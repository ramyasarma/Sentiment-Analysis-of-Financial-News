U.K. government bonds fell as stocks
rose, limiting the appeal of the safest assets, after the U.S.
Federal Reserve published minutes suggesting it’s ready to buy
more government debt.  Losses pushed the 10-year yield up from the lowest in six
weeks. The FTSE 100 Index of stocks rose 1.6 percent, its second
gain in three days. Fed policy makers last month were prepared
to ease monetary policy “before long,” minutes of their Sept.
21 session released yesterday in Washington showed. Gilts
declined even as Nationwide Building Society said  consumer
confidence  fell in September to an 18-month low and a government
report showed unemployment claims climbed.  “There’s a bit of a risk-on trade going on at the
moment,” said  Orlando Green , assistant director of capital-
markets strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank
in London. “Stocks are up and that’s helping push bond yields
higher. Data will have to be both weighty and a big surprise to
move markets, with everything else going on.”  The 10-year yield increased four basis points to 2.88
percent at 4.12 p.m. in London, after dropping yesterday to its
lowest since Aug. 31. The 4.75 percent security due March 2020
declined 0.33, or 3.3 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,588) face
amount, to 115.35. The two-year yield rose one basis point to
0.63 percent.  The pound declined for a third day against the euro,
depreciating 0.2 percent to 88.23 pence. It was 0.2 percent
stronger versus the dollar at $1.5837.  Sentiment Index  Nationwide’s index of sentiment fell 9 points from the
previous month to 53, the lowest since March 2009, the customer-
owned lender said today. Jobless claims rose by 5,300, the
Office for National Statistics said today in London. The median
prediction of 23 economists was for an increase of 4,500.  Gilts have gained 10.3 percent since the end of 2009,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch unit. German government bonds earned 9.5 percent, while
U.S. Treasuries returned 9.1 percent, the indexes show.  U.K. bonds gained this year on bets the Bank of England
will keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5
percent and consider stepping up bond purchases as the
government reduces spending. Bank of England policy maker  David Miles  said yesterday the U.K. still faces “big risks” as the
recovery remains “immature.”  The nation’s finance minister  George Osborne  will next week
reveal details of the cuts he announced in June to tackle the
nation’s record budget deficit.  “There are still vulnerabilities in the economy, so I
would still describe it as somewhat fragile,” former Bank of
England policy maker  Timothy Besley  said an interview at a
conference in Oslo today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
