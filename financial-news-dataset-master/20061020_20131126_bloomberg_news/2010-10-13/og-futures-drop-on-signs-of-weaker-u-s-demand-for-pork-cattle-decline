Hog futures fell on signs that U.S.
meatpackers are slowing purchases of the animals during a
seasonal slowdown in pork demand. Cattle also dropped.  The  price  of hogs for immediate delivery to slaughterhouses
slid 14 percent in the past three weeks, and its 10 straight
declines is the longest slump since August 2009, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. Wholesale-pork prices have dropped 14
percent since reaching a record on Aug. 24.  “You normally see demand for several of the pork cuts,
particularly those that are strong during the grilling season,
diminish once temperatures cool off,” said  Dan Vaught , the
owner of Vaught Futures Insights in Altus, Arkansas.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 1.075 cent, or 1.5
percent, to settle at 71.7 cents a pound at 1:06 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price has jumped 9.3 percent
this year.  Pork supplies are rising. About 2.106 million hogs were
processed last week, up 2.2 percent from a week earlier, the
USDA said. Slaughtered hogs in Iowa and southern Minnesota, the
main producing region, weighed about 272.6 pounds (123.7
kilograms), up 1.4 percent from a year earlier.  As of yesterday, the price for cash-market hogs had
declined 14 percent in three weeks to 69.91 cents a pound.  Cattle futures for December delivery dropped 0.825 cent, or
0.8 percent, to settle at 98.475 cents a pound on the CME. The
commodity has gained 14 percent this year. Feeder-cattle futures
for November settlement rose 0.875 cent, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at $1.08125 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
