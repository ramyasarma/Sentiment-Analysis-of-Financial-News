Germany’s benchmark DAX Index
climbed to the highest level in more than two years after
minutes from the Federal Reserve showed U.S. policy makers are
prepared to buy more government debt.  The DAX advanced 0.8 percent to 6,356.52 at 9:40 a.m. in
Frankfurt, on course for the highest close since Sept. 3, 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
