Okinawa Electric Power Co. , which
services Japan’s southernmost prefecture, rose after Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. raised the company’s rating to
“outperform,” saying the yen’s strength helped profitability.  The stock gained 3.8 percent to 3,715 yen as of the close
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest increase since June 28.
The shares have fallen 25 percent this year, compared with a 9.4
percent  drop  in the benchmark Topix index.  “Sales volume missed target, but fuel costs were lower
than anticipated due to yen appreciation and a lower crude
price,” Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley analyst  Reiji Ogino  wrote
in a report dated yesterday.  Ogino raised Okinawa Electric from “neutral,” a rating he
had maintained since Sept. 21, and lowered the share price
estimate to 5,000 yen from 5,400 yen.  Okinawa Electric in a statement to the exchange on July 30
maintained its forecast of 6.7 billion yen ($82 million) net
income for the year ending March 31, and raised its sales
estimate 0.6 percent to 160 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
