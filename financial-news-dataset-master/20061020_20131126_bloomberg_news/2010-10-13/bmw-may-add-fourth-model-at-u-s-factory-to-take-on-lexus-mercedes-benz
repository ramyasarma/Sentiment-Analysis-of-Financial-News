Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, may add a fourth model to
its South Carolina factory to challenge U.S. market leaders
Toyota Motor Corp.’s Lexus and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz.  “There’s always room on top,” Chief Executive Officer
 Norbert Reithofer  said in Spartanburg, South Carolina, at an
event to mark the addition of the factory’s third model, the X3
sport-utility vehicle. “We have ambitious goals for the U.S.”  BMW spent $750 million to make room for the revamped X3 in
Spartanburg, which comes in addition to the plant’s current X5
and X6 SUVs. An additional “volume” model for the U.S., the
world’s largest market for luxury cars, could be added in South
Carolina, said  Frank-Peter Arndt , BMW’s production chief.  BMW is investing in the facility to reduce foreign currency
exposure, which currently stands at more than 10 billion euros
($14 billion), Reithofer said. About 70 percent of the vehicles
built at the site are exported from the U.S., and more than 65
percent of the value of a vehicle built in South Carolina is
sourced from North America, BMW said.  It would make sense for BMW to assemble the 3-Series
compact in the U.S. to compete with the Mercedes-Benz C-Class,
said  Rebecca Lindland , an analyst at IHS Automotive in
Lexington, Massachusetts. The BMW brand sold 397,103 3-Series
cars last year out of total deliveries of 1.07 million.  ‘No-Brainer’  “The 3-Series is a no-brainer, if you’re looking to reduce
currency exposure; that’s their volume player,” Lindland said.
“That’s a business case that’s got to be studied.”  Daimler , the world’s second-largest maker of luxury cars,
said last December production of its best-selling C-Class sedan
would be moved to its Alabama factory, ending the model’s
assembly in Sindelfingen, Germany, after more than 25 years.  BMW  fell  7 cents, or 0.1 percent, to 50 euros at the 5:30
p.m. close of trading in Frankfurt. The stock has jumped 57
percent this year, valuing the carmaker at 31.9 billion euros.  The maker of BMW, Mini, and  Rolls-Royce  models plans to
sell at least 250,000 vehicles in the U.S. in 2010, a gain of
more than 10 percent, and aims to expand its share, executives
at the Munich-based carmaker said yesterday. The U.S. high-end
market will gradually return to pre-crisis levels over the next
three to four years, the CEO said. BMW is targeting sales of
300,000 in the U.S. longer term.  The German carmaker’s U.S. sales rose 9.2 percent to
157,464 vehicles through September. Mercedes-Benz’s nine-month
deliveries climbed 18 percent to 159,729 cars and SUVs. Lexus
remained the U.S. leader with purchases of 162,438.  Added Capacity  The addition of the X3 in Spartanburg raises BMW’s annual
U.S. capacity 50 percent to 240,000. South Carolina has
supported the factory by training workers at local technical
colleges and offering tax breaks for new hires. The state also
charges BMW just $1 a year to lease the plant’s land, which is
owned by South Carolina’s ports authority.  The new X3, which goes on sale in the U.S. on Jan. 22, will
be bigger, adding more than 3 inches in length and 1 inch in
width, and be sold at a lower price, to take on  Volkswagen AG ’s
Audi Q5. BMW will also begin selling the X1 crossover in the
U.S. in 2011, said U.S. chief  Jim O’Donnell .  The overhauled X3, offering optional in-car Internet
access, will have a starting price of $37,625, O’Donnell said.
That’s about $1,225 lower than the current asking price and
closer to the $35,200  Audi  charges for the Q5, introduced in
March of 2009.  Nine-month U.S. deliveries of the Q5 jumped 78 percent to
16,636 vehicles, making it Audi’s second-best seller in the
country after the A4 sedan. The X3’s nine-month U.S. sales fell
1.2 percent to 5,036 as consumers wait for the new version.  “We have given up the market with the old X3 for these
last two years,” O’Donnell said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. “Next year we’ll be back on top.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
