Mincor Resources NL , an Australian
metal supplier to  BHP Billiton Ltd. , is looking to acquire
nickel projects as it increases production.  “We’re interested in acquisitions,”  David Moore , managing
director of the Perth-based company, said today in an interview.
“We’re looking to acquire projects at any stage of their
development.”  Nickel for immediate delivery on the London Metal Exchange
has risen 30 percent this year to close at $24,009 a metric ton
yesterday as demand for the metal used to make stainless steel
improved in line with the global economic recovery. The price
will average $26,165 a ton next year,  David Wilson , an analyst
at Societe Generale, said yesterday.  Mincor  fell 0.5 percent to A$1.99 at the end of trading on
the Australian stock exchange. The company, which has a market
value of A$399 million ($393 million), generated  cash from
operations  of A$99.49 million in the year ended June 30, more
than double the 12 months before.  “Demand is not too bad, it’s healthy,” Moore said.
“We’ve got a fairly strong price. The market in the next three
to four years is quite finely balanced in production and supply.
Supply surprises and any production underperformance could push
supply into deficit which in nickel means an immediate price
response.”  Mincor is targeting production of between 13,500 metric
tons and 14,500 tons in the year ending June 30, 2011, and
between 15,000 tons and 16,000 tons for the following 12 months,
Moore said.  The company’s agreement to sell all its production to BHP,
the world’s biggest mining company, expires in 2019. Mincor’s
two mining centers in Western Australia’s  Kambalda district 
include six underground mines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
