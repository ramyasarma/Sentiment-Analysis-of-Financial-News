NEC Corp., Japan’s largest maker of
personal computers, will invest 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion)
by the fiscal year ending March 2013 to beef up its offerings in
IT services as the company moves away from less profitable
hardware businesses.  IT services made up about 24 percent of NEC’s 3.6 trillion
yen in total revenue last fiscal year. Network systems were 22
percent of sales, while the company’s personal solutions
division, which makes PCs and mobile phones, accounted for 21
percent of revenue.  The company announced the investment in a statement
distributed at a briefing in Tokyo today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
