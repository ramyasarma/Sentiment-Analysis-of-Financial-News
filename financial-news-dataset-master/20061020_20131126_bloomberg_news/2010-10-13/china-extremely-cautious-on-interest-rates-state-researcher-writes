China will become “extremely
cautious” in raising interest rates in order to prevent hot
money inflows and to control the pace of yuan appreciation,
Zhang Monan, a researcher with the State Information Center,
wrote in a commentary published in the China Securities Journal
newspaper today.  China may be forced to abandon its independent interest
rate policy stance as it faces a slew of challenges such as
inflation, rapidly rising asset prices and capital inflows,
Zhang wrote. The nation is expected to stick to a monetary
policy that can be ‘dynamically fine-tuned’’ for quite a long
period in the future, Zhang wrote.  Excess liquidity resulting from quantitative monetary
easing in major economies is set to pose an increasingly grimmer
challenge to China’s economy in the next few years, Zhang wrote.
The State Information Center is a researcher under the National
Development and Reform Commission.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
