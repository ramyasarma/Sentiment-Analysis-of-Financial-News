Weekly coal prices at Qinhuangdao
port, a benchmark in China, extended gains as power plants
stockpiled fuel before increased winter demand.  The price of power-station coal with an energy value of
5,500 kilocalories per kilogram rose 1.4 percent to between 725
yuan ($109) and 735 yuan a metric ton as of today compared with
Sept. 29, according to  data  from the China Coal Transportation
and Distribution Association.  The government started today an index that tracks power-
station coal prices at six major Chinese ports. The weekly
Bohai-Rim Steam-coal Price Index, or BSPI, climbed 1.3 percent
to 725 as of today from Oct. 6, the association said.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editors:  Ryan Woo ,  Jane Lee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
