Raiffeisen Bank International AG  is
interested in Polbank, the Polish unit of Greece’s  EFG Eurobank
Ergasias SA , Wirtschaftsblatt reported, citing an interview with
Chief Executive Officer Herbert Stepic .  “Polbank certainly is a possibility to grow stronger in
the Polish market,” Stepic told the Vienna-based paper. “There
is an interest, but there haven’t been any negotiations yet.”  The Polish market is “too interesting in the long term, to
only have a niche policy,” Wirtschaftsblatt cited Stepic as
saying.  Raiffeisen Bank isn’t interested in buying Bayerische
Landesbank’s MKB Bank in Hungary, the CEO also told the paper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
