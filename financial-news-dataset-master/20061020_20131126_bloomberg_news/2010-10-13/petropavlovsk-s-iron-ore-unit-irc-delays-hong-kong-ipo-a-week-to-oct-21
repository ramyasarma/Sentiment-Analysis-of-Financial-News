Petropavlovsk Plc’s  iron ore unit
 IRC Ltd.  delayed a Hong Kong stock exchange listing by a week
after the parent said last week that demand for the initial
public offering had failed to meet its “highest expectations.”  The final allocation of shares will be completed by Oct.
20, according to the offer terms. IRC, with iron ore projects in
Russia, already cut the size of the IPO by more than half,
according to a sales document sent to investors on Oct. 8. Bank
of  America Corp. ’s Merrill Lynch unit, UBS AG and Bank of China
International Holdings Ltd. are managing the offer.  IRC is seeking about HK$1.87 billion ($241 million) through
a sale of 1.04 billion new shares at HK$1.80 apiece, according
to the terms. The company had previously offered 1.325 billion
shares at HK$2.20 to HK$3 each to raise as much as HK$3.98
billion, according to a Sept. 29 statement.  Petropavlovsk said today it expects the sale to raise about
$222 million. The company will hold 65.6 percent of IRC after
the offer, London-based Petropavlovsk said in a statement.  “Whether this is sufficient to fund that large working
capital requirement of the unprofitable business and development
of the K&S magnetite deposit is unknown,” Collins Stewart Plc
wrote in note to investors today.  Petropavlovsk is seeking to develop iron ore assets it
bought last year. The company acquired the deposits in Russia
when it purchased Aricom Plc for 294.5 million pounds ($467
million) in 2009, buying back a company it span off in 2003.  K&S Project  The K&S iron ore project in Russia’s Amur region is about
40 miles from the Chinese border and will produce 3.2 million
metric tons of iron-ore concentrate a year starting in 2013.
It’s also developing the Kuranakh iron ore mine and plans to
build a third at its Garinskoye deposit.  IRC joins commodity producers including  United Co. Rusal ,
the world’s largest aluminum maker, in raising funds in Hong
Kong as Chinese raw-material demand jumps. Petropavlovsk said in
a statement on Oct. 8 it would alter the terms of the IRC offer
because of a shortage of investor demand.  Shares in the company rose 35 pence, or 3.5 percent, to
1,034 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
