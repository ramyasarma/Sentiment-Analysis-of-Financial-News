Investor AB, the Wallenberg family’s
publicly traded holding company, said it sees “strong” growth
in Asia and Latin America in the future and that it will
continue to work with its holdings, which include Atlas Copco AB
and Ericsson AB, to invest in the growth in those regions.  “It is easy to be optimistic about Asia and Latin America
and thus to companies with exposure to those regions, but we
must not forget that high-growth economies historically have
been prone to overheating and we should be prepared for
setbacks,” Investor AB Chief Executive Officer Boerje Ekholm
said in its third-quarter report today. “The long-term outlook
is, however, strong. Up until some 200 years ago, China was the
world’s dominant economy -- time for ‘Back to the Future!’”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
