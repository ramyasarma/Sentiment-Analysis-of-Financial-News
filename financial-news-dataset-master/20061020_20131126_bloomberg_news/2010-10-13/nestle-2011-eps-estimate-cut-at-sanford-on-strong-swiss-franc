Nestle SA,  the world’s biggest food
company, had its 2011 earnings per share estimate cut by Sanford
C. Bernstein on concern the strong Swiss franc will hurt profit
growth.  The EPS estimate was trimmed 8 percent to 3.65 Swiss francs
($3.82) a share, according to a note today by  Andrew Wood , a
Sanford analyst. Wood estimates that the strong franc will cut 5
percent from Nestle’s sales and profit. In May he had expected a
benefit.  Sanford also cut EPS estimates for Unilever NV, Groupe
Danone SA, L’Oreal SA and Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, by 4 percent
each.  “Foreign exchange headwinds are coming back,” Wood wrote
in today’s note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
