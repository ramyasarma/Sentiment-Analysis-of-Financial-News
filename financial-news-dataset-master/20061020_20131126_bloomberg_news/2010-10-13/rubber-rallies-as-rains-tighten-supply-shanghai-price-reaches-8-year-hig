Rubber climbed to the highest level
in six months as persistent rainfall in key producing countries
raised concerns that supplies may tighten amid increasing
purchases from China, the largest buyer. Shanghai rubber
advanced to a record.  Futures in Tokyo gained as much as 2 percent to 334.6 yen
per kilogram ($4,091 a metric ton), the highest level since
April 19, before trading at 333.4 yen at 2:22 p.m. local time.
Shanghai futures surged as much as 4.6 percent to a record
30,670 yuan a ton ($4,599), the Shanghai Futures Exchange said
in an e-mail.  “The rubber industry remains bullish as Chinese buyers
have increased purchases after National Day holidays as its
inventories are still low,” said Varut Rungkhum, an analyst at
Bangkok-based commodity broker Agro Wealth Ltd.  China imported 190,000 metric tons of natural rubber in
September, the customs agency said today on its website.  “The high level of China imports reflects that demand
there continues to grow and will likely expand to replenish its
stockpiles,”  Chaiwat Muenmee , analyst at commodity broker DS
Futures Co., said by phone from Bangkok. “Inventories in China
and Japan remain low, while rubber supplies are limited, which
will bolster prices.”  Rubber stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses expanded 26.1
percent to 7,282 tons on Sept. 20, according to data from the
Rubber Trade Association of Japan released yesterday.  Natural-rubber  inventories  climbed 5,320 tons to 36,900
tons, the Shanghai exchange said Oct. 8, based on a survey of 10
warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin.
That’s 76 percent lower than this year’s high of 151,832 tons on
Jan. 21.  The March-delivery contract on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange last traded 3.2 percent higher at 30,280 yuan.  Hainan Flood  “Rainfall this year has been longer and heavier than the
previous year, lowering latex levels in key producing
countries,” Varut said by phone today. “Floods in Hainan will
probably reduce output in China.”  Flooding in China’s southern island province of Hainan
forced the evacuation of 440,000 people and destroyed 3,000
houses, with more rain expected, Xinhua News Agency reported
yesterday, citing Governor Luo Baoming. A total of 166,700
hectares (411,925 acres) of crops have been damaged, including
74,000 hectares destroyed, the news agency said.  Cash prices in Thailand added 0.3 percent today to 116.80
baht ($3.92) per kilogram as China raised purchases to
substitute declining output from flooding in rubber plantation
area, according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.
Local rubber processors also accelerated purchases on worries
over supply shortage, the institute said.  Rubber prices in Indonesia, the world’s second-largest
producer, climbed to $3.87 a kilogram today as heavy rain
disrupted tapping, lowering production,  Asril Sutan Amir ,
chairman of the Rubber Association of Indonesia, said by phone
today.  The price may advance to $4 a kilogram by the end of the
month because of a “supply shortage,” while domestic demand
keeps expanding, he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
