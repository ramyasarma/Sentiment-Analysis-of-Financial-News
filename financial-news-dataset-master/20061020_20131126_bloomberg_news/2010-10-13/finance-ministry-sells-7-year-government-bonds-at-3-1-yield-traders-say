China’s finance ministry sold 28
billion yuan ($4.2 billion) in seven-year bonds at an average
yield of 3.1 percent, according to traders at BOC International
(China) Ltd. and Industrial Bank Co.  The highest winning-bid yield at the sale was 3.13 percent,
said the traders at the primary dealers required to bid at the
government auctions. The issuance drew bids 1.66 times the
amount on offer, according to the traders.  The average yield at today’s auction was in line with the
3.1 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 13
finance companies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
