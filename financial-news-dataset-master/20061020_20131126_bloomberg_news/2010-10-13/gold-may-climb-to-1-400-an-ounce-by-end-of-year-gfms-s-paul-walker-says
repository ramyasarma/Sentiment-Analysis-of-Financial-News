Gold may climb to $1,400 an ounce by
the end of the year as investor demand will remain strong
because of low interest rates, the European sovereign-debt
crisis and fears about an economic slowdown,  GFMS Ltd . said.  “The risks are in the upside in terms of surging
investment,” Chief Executive Officer  Paul Walker  said in an
interview in Tokyo today. “That could put the price toward
$1,400 for sure by the end of the year.”  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,356.30 an ounce at
2:25 p.m. Tokyo time. The price reached a record high of
$1,364.77 on Oct. 7 and is headed for the 10th year of annual
gains as investors seek to protect their wealth from a weakening
U.S. dollar and lower interest rates. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
forecast on Oct. 11 that bullion may gain to $1,400 in three
months and $1,525 in six months.  “The investment climate for gold at the moment is very
strong, so there is no doubt that it could go higher,” Walker
said. The price could exceed $1,400 and is unlikely to drop
below $1,300 within the next six months, he added.  Expectations for higher gold prices put a brake on scrap
supplies and central bank sales this year, Walker said. The
official sector is forecast to become a net buyer of 15 metric
tons this year compared with net selling of 30 tons last year,
according to a report presented by GFMS, the London-based
research company, to an industry seminar today in Tokyo. Supply
of recycled metal is expected to gain 4.8 percent to 1,753 tons.  Central Banks  “Central banks in Europe are likely, over the next year or
two years, to return to modest net selling,” Walker said. “By
any measure, most of the European central banks are overweight
in gold, and some members will start selling.”  Net sales by European central banks could be somewhere
between 50 and 150 tons, and might be absorbed by emerging
economies that seek bullion for asset diversification, he said.  Demand is forecast to grow 2.6 percent to 4,389 tons this
year from 2009, as investment demand for gold bars may surge 59
percent to 337 tons, according to the GFMS report.  Concerns over inflation, the value of the dollar, European
debt and slowdown in global growth will likely fuel investment
demand in coming months, Walker said.  Assets  in exchange-traded products backed by gold increased
to 2,086.27 tons yesterday from 2,083.55 tons on Oct. 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers.
Holdings reached a record 2,097.01 tons on Sept. 30 and are up
16 percent this year.  Gold has gained 24 percent this year, outperforming stocks,
bonds and some industrial commodities.  The Dollar Index fell for a second day to near the lowest
level since January on speculation that the Federal Reserve will
take steps to support growth. The Fed yesterday said in its
September meeting minutes that it was prepared to ease monetary
policy “before long.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
