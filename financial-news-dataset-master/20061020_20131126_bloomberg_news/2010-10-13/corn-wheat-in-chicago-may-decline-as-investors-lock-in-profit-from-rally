Corn and soybeans rose for a fifth
day in Chicago and wheat gained as the dollar weakened, making
U.S. supplies more attractive to importers and investors.  Corn for December delivery climbed as high as $5.88 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest level since
August 2008, and was up 0.3 percent at $5.81 at 12:48 p.m. Paris
time. The contract has surged 17 percent since the close on Oct.
7, the day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its
estimate of the nation’s crop for the second time in two months.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, fell for a second day after minutes of the
Federal Reserve’s September meeting showed monetary policy may
be eased further “before long.” That spurred speculation about
further quantitative easing, or asset purchases by the Fed.  “With that quantitative easing, we might see the dollar
weaken further,”  Chung Yang Ker , an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte in Singapore, said by phone today. “This could boost prices
of commodities denominated in dollars.”  A slumping dollar makes raw materials priced in the
currency cheaper in terms of other monies and spurs demand for
commodities as an alternative investment.  The USDA last week pared its estimate of the nation’s corn
crop, the world’s biggest, by 3.8 percent. It predicted a
harvest of 321.7 million metric tons after flooding in June and
hot, dry weather in August curbed yields.  Wheat, Soybeans  December-delivery wheat gained 1 percent to $7.17 a bushel.
Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 0.3 percent to 221.25 euros ($309.09) a ton.  Soybeans for January delivery added 0.7 percent to $11.98 a
bushel in Chicago.  Rough rice for November delivery climbed 0.8 percent to
$13.49 per 100 pounds, extending yesterday’s 2.9 percent
advance. The grain on Oct. 11 touched $13.515, the highest price
since March 3.  Rice futures may climb as high as $17 per 100 pounds by
January on concern that U.S. milled-rice production may be at
least 10 percent smaller than the USDA estimated after dry
weather cut yields,  Dwight A. Roberts , president of the U.S.
Rice Producers Association, said on Oct. 11. Roberts correctly
predicted last year that the grain would peak at $16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
