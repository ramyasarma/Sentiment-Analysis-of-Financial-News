South African public sector labor
unions haven’t reached the 50.1 percent minimum level of
agreement necessary for the government to implement its improved
wage offer, unions said.  Only 36 percent of unions affiliated to the Congress of
South African Trade Unions agreed to sign the wage offer, Asanda
Fongqo, spokesman for the Democratic Nursing Organization of
South Africa, said in a phone interview from Pretoria today. The
Independent Labor Caucus has requested more time to consult with
members after unions failed to agree to sign the offer, Chris
Klopper, chairman of the group, said in a phone interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
