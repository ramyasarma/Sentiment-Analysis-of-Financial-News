Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc won
an order from a London court reversing changes to Liverpool
soccer club’s board that would block its planned sale to New
England Sports Ventures LLC.  Owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett had sought to halt the
sale of Britain’s most successful team, saying the 300 million-
pound ($476 million) price is too low. RBS says the Americans
breached their contract with the bank when they tried to replace
board members who are in favor of the sale and asked the court
to step in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
