Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. Chief
Executive Officer Andrew Forrest may step back and become non-
executive chairman of the iron ore producer after the board
meets next month to approve studies on its two expansion
projects, the Australian Financial Review reported in its Street
Talk column, without saying where it got the information. Former
Lihir Gold Ltd. Managing Director Graeme Hunt and former
Fortescue executive Alan Watling may be considered for the CEO
role, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
