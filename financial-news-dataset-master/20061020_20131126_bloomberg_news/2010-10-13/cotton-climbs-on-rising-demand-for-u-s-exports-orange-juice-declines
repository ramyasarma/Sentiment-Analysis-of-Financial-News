Cotton futures rose for the sixth
time in seven sessions on rising demand for supplies from the
U.S., the world’s biggest exporter. Orange juice slumped.  Since Aug. 1, the U.S. has exported 281,000 metric tons of
upland cotton a week on average, the government said on Oct. 7.
That’s up 31 percent from last year. China, the biggest
consumer, bought 56 percent of last week’s shipments. Yesterday,
futures extended a rally to a 15-year high.  “We’re exporting as fast as it’s coming out,” said  Louis Barbera , a broker at VIP Commodities in New York. Mills are
“happy to buy it,” he said.  Cotton for December delivery rose 1.29 cents, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $1.1087 a pound at 2:32 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Yesterday, the fiber reached $1.1238,
the highest level since June 19, 1995. The price has jumped 47
percent this year.  The quality of some cotton may be “undesirable to the
spinning mills,” further limiting supplies, said  Mike Stevens ,
an independent trader in Mandeville, Louisiana. The fiber from
U.S. fields may be too mature, he said.  U.S. crop conditions deteriorated in the week ending Oct.
10 with 55 percent of the fiber in good or excellent condition,
down from 56 percent in the previous week, the Department of
Agriculture said yesterday.  The  Cotlook A Index , which reflects the average of the five
cheapest cotton prices offered at Far East ports, rose to a
record $1.252 a pound yesterday. The gauge dropped 1 percent
today.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery fell 2.3 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to settle at $1.484 a pound in New York.
Earlier, the price touched $1.455, the lowest level since Sept.
