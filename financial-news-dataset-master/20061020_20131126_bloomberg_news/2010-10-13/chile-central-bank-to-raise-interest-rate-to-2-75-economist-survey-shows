Chilean policy makers will slow the
pace of interest rate increases in their monthly meeting
tomorrow, according to central bank surveys of economists and
traders published today.  The bank will raise its benchmark rate by a quarter-point
to 2.75 percent from 2.5 percent after four straight half-point
increases, according to the median forecast of economists and
traders in separate surveys published on the central bank
website. The median forecast of 20 economists  surveyed by
Bloomberg  is for a quarter-point increase.  Economists estimate that the peso will trade at 490 per
dollar in December and consumer prices will rise 0.2 percent
this month from September. Traders estimate the peso will trade
at 480 per dollar in seven days and 485 per dollar in three
months time as consumer prices increase 0.13 percent in October
from the previous month.  Chile’s peso rose 0.3 percent against the dollar to 474.05
per dollar today at 8:10 a.m. New York time, its strongest level
since May 2008. The peso has appreciated 12.9 percent against
the dollar in the past three months, the second-best performance
among 25 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after
the Czech koruna.  Peso  A policy maker said at the central bank’s September meeting
that the exchange rate had moved to the outer extremes of a
range considered to be “in equilibrium,” according to minutes
of the meeting published on the bank’s website. The peso closed
at 498.25 on the day of the September meeting.  The bank last month discussed smaller increases to the
benchmark lending rate, according to the minutes. The bank
ultimately decided to raise rates by a half-point Sept. 16.  Policy makers probably will slow the pace of rate increases
at tomorrow’s meeting in bid to stem the peso’s gains, Bank of
America said in an Oct. 8 report. The central bank may then
begin intervening in the currency market to weaken the currency,
Latin American strategists  David Beker  and  Alberto Boquin  said
in the report.  Policy makers have discussed intervention, bank President
 Jose De Gregorio  told lawmakers Oct. 6. The bank last intervened
in 2008 when it bought U.S. dollars at a rate of $50 million a
day.  Chile’s economy  probably expanded more than 7 percent in
the three months through September from the previous year, which
would be the fastest pace since 2004, Finance Minister  Felipe Larrain  said in an Oct. 5 address to Congress.  Economic activity grew 7 percent in September and will grow
5.4 percent in 2010 and 6 percent in 2011, according to the
median estimate of 40 economists in the bank’s survey.  The economy will grow 5.1 percent this year and 6.1 percent
in 2011, according to the projections the ministry used in its
budget proposal for next year. The ministry also forecast an
average exchange rate for next year of 500 pesos to the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
