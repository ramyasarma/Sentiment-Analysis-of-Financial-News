Minara Resources Ltd. , a nickel
producer controlled by Glencore International AG, cut its
full-year output forecast because of a power failure at its
plant in Australia.  Production of the metal may be between 28,000 metric tons
and 30,000 tons in the 12 months ending Jan. 31, the Perth-based
company said today in a statement. That compares with an earlier
forecast of 30,000 tons to 34,000 tons.  Third-quarter nickel output fell 15 percent because of the
five-day steam turbine shutdown last month, Minara said. It
produced 7,358 tons of nickel and 520 tons of cobalt in the
quarter at its Murrin Murrin project in Western Australia.  “The main reason we revised our production guidance was
due to the failure of a major power generation unit at Murrin
Murrin in September,” Chief Executive Officer  Peter Johnston 
said in the statement. “Nickel and cobalt prices have remained
robust during the reporting period yet we are alert to the
impacts of the Australian dollar movements on our balance
sheet.”  Minara  fell 4.9 percent to 78 cents at 11:46 a.m. Sydney
time on the Australian stock exchange.  A triennial plant shutdown for maintenance began Oct. 1 and
is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
