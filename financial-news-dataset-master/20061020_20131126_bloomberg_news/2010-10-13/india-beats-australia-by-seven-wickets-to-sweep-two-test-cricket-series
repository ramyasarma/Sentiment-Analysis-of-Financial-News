India beat Australia by seven
wickets in the second cricket Test in Bangalore to sweep the
Border-Gavaskar series 2-0.          Sachin Tendulkar, who scored 214 in India’s first innings,
finished unbeaten on 53 on the fifth day. Cheteshwar Pujara
made 72 and Rahul Dravid was 21 not out.                 India, the top-ranked Test team, reached the victory target
of 207 for the loss of three wickets. Earlier, Australia was
dismissed for 223 after resuming on 202-7. India won the opening
match in Mohali by one wicket.  Australia’s defeat means it will start an Ashes contest
ranked lower than England for the first time since Test rankings
were introduced in 2003.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
