Copper, trading little changed in
Asia, may gain for a second day as a weaker dollar and improving
fundamentals boosted investor demand for the metal used in
construction and automobiles.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange traded unchanged at $8,345 a metric ton by 8:18 a.m. in
Singapore. It rose to $8,388 a ton on Oct. 11, the highest level
in 27 months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
