The European Union regulator said it
may call within two weeks for low-carbon technology projects
that could be financed by selling allowances set aside under the
the bloc’s emissions-trading system.  “We’re about to settle the last details,” Jos Delbeke,
director general for climate at the European Commission, said
today in Brussels. “We have a package of three documents to be
adopted: form of decision on New Entrants Reserve, cooperation
agreement with European Investment Bank and launching the call
for tender. I’m confident that within two weeks these documents
will be out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
