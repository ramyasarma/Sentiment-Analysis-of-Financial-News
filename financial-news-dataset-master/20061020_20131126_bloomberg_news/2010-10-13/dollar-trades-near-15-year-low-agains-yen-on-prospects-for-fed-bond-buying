The dollar depreciated below 81 yen,
a 15-year low, and reached its weakest since January against the
euro before reports likely to fuel speculation the Federal
Reserve will ease monetary policy further.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against the
currencies of six major trading partners, reached a 10-month low
before data forecast to show slower gains in U.S. wholesale
costs and consumer prices. Singapore’s dollar rose to a record
as the island’s central bank said it will widen the currency’s
trading band to curb inflation. Australia’s dollar reached the
highest since it began trading freely in 1983 as Asian stocks
extended a global rally. The U.S. and Canadian dollars reached
parity, the greenback’s weakest level since April, as minutes
this week suggested the Fed may pump more cash into the economy.  “The market is in a state of anxiety over what’s likely to
come from the Fed,” said  Lee Hardman , a foreign-exchange
strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London.
“Dollar holders are very nervous based on the Fed minutes,
which suggest more unconventional policy measures. That could
result in them keeping their foot on the printing press for
longer and harder than maybe anyone had thought. Everyone seems
to be selling the dollar because of the Fed view.”  The dollar fell 0.8 percent to 81.13 yen at 6:37 a.m. in
New York from 81.81 yen yesterday, and touched 80.89 yen, the
weakest since April 20, 1995. It slid to $1.4069 per euro from
$1.3961 and earlier reached $1.4122, the lowest level since Jan.
26. The euro traded at 114.14 yen, from 114.20 yen.  There’s a 78 percent chance the yen will equal the record
79.75 per dollar by the end of this quarter, according to
options trading monitored by Bloomberg. The currency pair
reached that level on April 19, 1995.  Dollar Index  The  Dollar Index , used by  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.  to
track the greenback against currencies including the euro, yen
and Swiss franc, dropped to 76.259, the lowest since Dec. 14,
before trading at 76.524. The dollar weakened to 99.81 Canadian
cents before trading at C$1.0018 from C$1.0033 yesterday. The
U.S. currency sank to a record low of 0.9463 Swiss francs before
trading at 0.9515, from 0.9585 yesterday.  Rising prices for Canada’s commodity exports and the
prospect of becoming the first Group of Seven nation to balance
its budget helped propel the nation’s currency, known as the
loonie, to U.S. dollar parity for the first time in almost six
months. The loonie is up 2.8 percent over the past 30 days
versus the greenback, which has dropped against all of its 16
most-traded counterparts during that period.  Pressure on China  China’s yuan advanced to its strongest level against the
dollar since 1993 on speculation policy makers will yield to
intensifying international pressure to let the currency
appreciate faster.  The Chinese central bank set the reference rate at 6.6582
per dollar, the highest level since a peg was dropped in July
2005. U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said
yesterday a bill punishing China over the value of the yuan may
well pass in the U.S. Senate, with Congress submitting it to
President  Barack Obama  for his signature.  “It’s partly due to the pressure on the international
front,” said  Emmanuel Ng , a currency strategist at Oversea-
Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “The broad dollar weakened
yesterday and today. We have a combination of two factors.”  The yuan rose 0.2 percent to 6.6508 per dollar, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.6503,
the strongest level since the central bank unified the official
and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Bernanke Speaks  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will speak tomorrow on
monetary policy objectives and tools in Boston. He said on Oct.
4 that the central bank’s first round of large-scale asset
purchases aided the economy and that more quantitative easing is
likely to help further.  Gains in prices paid to producers slowed to 0.1 percent
after a 0.4 percent gain in August, economists estimated the
Labor Department will report today.  Consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in September after a 0.3
percent gain the prior month, according to the median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before tomorrow’s report.
Prices excluding food and energy likely increased in September
for a sixth month at an annual rate of 0.9 percent, matching the
slowest year-over-year rate of gains since 1966.  “We are looking at the prospect of further quantitative
easing in November or December,” said  Adam Carr , a senior
economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “You’re not likely
to see any dollar strength” until the Fed next meets, he said.  The Dollar Index will drop by at least 3 to 5 percent and
by as much as 10 to 15 percent into the year’s end if the Fed
announces an increase in purchases of government debt, Carr
said. The central bank’s next two-day meeting starts Nov. 2.  Singapore’s MAS  Singapore’s dollar gained for a second day after the
 Monetary Authority of Singapore  said it will seek a faster
appreciation of its currency to temper inflation even as the
economy grows at a slower and more sustainable pace.  “This is effectively monetary tightening and reflects
concerns about domestic inflation,” said  Kit Wei Zheng , a
Singapore-based economist at Citigroup Inc. “The steeper slope
will allow a faster pace of appreciation. The wider band will
deal with the increased volatility in the market.”  Singapore’s currency rose 0.5 percent to S$1.2964 versus
its U.S. counterpart, after earlier appreciating as much as 1
percent to S$1.2893, the strongest since 1981 when Bloomberg
began compiling data.  Emerging-Market Currencies  Emerging-market currencies are likely to rise against the
dollar as consumer demand in those nations is taking over from
U.S. household spending as a major driver of the world economy,
according to  Curtis Mewbourne , a managing director at Newport
Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management Co.  Investors seeking to benefit from growth in developing
markets may want to look at investing in local-currency
government bonds while dollar-denominated bonds issued by
emerging-market corporations also may be attractive, he  wrote  on
the firm’s website.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies outside of Japan, has
advanced 4.6 percent this year and today reached as much as
115.81, its highest since April 2008. The MSCI Asia Pacific
 Index  climbed 2 percent to its highest in two years.  Aussie Inflation  Australia’s currency gained to the most since exchange
controls were removed in 1983 as monthly consumer inflationary
expectations for October rose to 3.8 percent from 3.1 percent,
according to an e-mailed report from the Melbourne Institute for
Economic and Social Research. Australia’s central bank aims to
keep inflation between 2 percent and 3 percent.  Benchmark rates of 4.5 percent in  Australia  and 3 percent
in  New Zealand , compared with rates as low as zero in the U.S.
and Japan, attract investors to the South Pacific nations’
higher-yielding assets.  Australia’s currency rose as high as 99.94 U.S. cents
before trading at 99.40 cents, from 99.05 cents yesterday. The
so-called Aussie fell to 80.67 yen from 81.03 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar slipped to 75.96 U.S. cents from 76.06
cents yesterday after earlier touching 76.44 cents, the most
since July 2008. It declined to 61.64 yen from 62.22 yen.  The Aussie may peak at $1.05 and stay above parity against
the greenback until September 2011 as the Fed holds down rates,
National Australia Bank Ltd. said in a note to clients.  To contact the reporters on this story:
