The  Federal Reserve  drained $260
million in temporary  reserves  from the banking system by
arranging five-day tri-party reverse repurchase agreements with
money-market funds for the first time.  Settlement is tomorrow. In a reverse repo, the central bank
sells securities for a set period, temporarily draining cash
from the banking system. At maturity, the securities are
returned to the Fed and the cash to the counterparties in the
transactions.  The central bank is putting the infrastructure in place to
remove or neutralize the more than $1 trillion in extra cash
from the Fed’s balance sheet even as policy makers contemplate
buying additional  securities  to ensure that the economic
recovery takes hold. The operation, part of a series that began
last year, doesn’t represent any change in monetary policy.  The number of counterparties used for reverse repurchase
agreements was expanded in August to add money-market funds
managed by 14 firms, including Fidelity Investments and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. The new firms aren’t eligible to participate in
other transactions. Today’s transaction included the 18 primary
dealers that serve as counterparties to open market operations.  In a tri-party arrangement, a third party functions as the
agent for the transaction and holds the security as collateral.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. are the
only banks that serve in a trade-clearing capacity in the tri-
party repo market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
