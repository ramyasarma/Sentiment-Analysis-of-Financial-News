The European Union grain harvest is
estimated to fall 4 percent this year to 284.9 million metric
tons as yields decline for all cereals except corn, the bloc’s
farm-weather monitoring unit said.  Barley output may slide about 13 percent to 53.6 million
tons, the EU’s  Monitoring Agricultural Resources  unit, or MARS,
said in a  report  dated Oct. 12 and published on its website
today. The wheat harvest is estimated at 136.8 million tons,
the unit said, without saying how that compares with 2009.  Wheat production fell an estimated 3.3 percent in France,
5.5 percent in Germany and 4.2 percent in Poland, MARS said.
This year’s wheat harvest is likely to be better than in
2009 for the U.K., Italy, Romania and Spain, it said.  For barley, all main producers face a decrease in
production, other than Spain, Romania and Bulgaria, MARS said.  EU corn production is estimated to decline 1.4 percent to
57.1 million tons. Better yields are expected in Italy,
Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria, the agricultural weather unit
said, while in Germany yields are forecast to slide 13 percent
to 8.5 tons a hectare (2.47 acres).  Soft-wheat yields are estimated to drop 3.1 percent to
5.57 tons a hectare, while durum productivity probably
slipped 1.3 percent to 3.06 tons a hectare, MARS said. Corn
yields probably climbed 2.9 percent to 7.06 tons a hectare.  Potato yields across the 27-nation EU are estimated at
27.50 tons a hectare, a decline of 8.4 percent, and farmers
in the bloc will harvest an estimated average 65.3 tons of
sugar beets a hectare, down 8.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
