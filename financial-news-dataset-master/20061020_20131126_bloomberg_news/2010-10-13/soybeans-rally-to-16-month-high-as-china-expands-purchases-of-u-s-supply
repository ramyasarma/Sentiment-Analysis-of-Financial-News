Soybeans rose to a 16-month high as
China, the world’s largest consumer and importer, expanded
purchases from the U.S., the top grower and exporter.  China bought 297,500 metric tons for delivery in the year
that began Sept. 1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.
China’s National Grain and Oils Information Center today said
that imports will jump 35 percent in the fourth quarter to 13.8
million tons as demand grows for animal feed and cooking oil.
Soybean prices are up 32 percent since the end of June.  “Chinese demand for U.S. soybeans continues to provide
support,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities
Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 5.25 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $11.8375 a bushel at 10:24 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after touching $11.945, the highest price since
June 5, 2009. The commodity has rallied since June on
speculation that hot, dry weather reduced U.S. yields.  Prices also rose as a slumping dollar boosted investor
demand for commodities an alternative investment, Roose said.
Gold rose to a record, and the dollar slipped to the lowest
level since January against a basket of six major currencies on
speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy
further to spur economic growth.  “The dollar’s decline continues to attract fund money,”
Roose said.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
