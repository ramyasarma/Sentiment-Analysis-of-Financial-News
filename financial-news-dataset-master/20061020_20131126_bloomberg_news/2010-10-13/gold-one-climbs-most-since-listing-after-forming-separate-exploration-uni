Gold One International Ltd. , which
mines the metal in Australia and southern Africa, rose to its
highest intraday level since listing after creating a separate
exploration and development unit called Goliath Gold Mining.  Shares in Gold One rose as much as 25 cents, or 11 percent,
to 2.60 rand in Johannesburg, the highest intraday level since
May last year. The stock was trading 9.8 percent higher at 1:50
p.m. local time.  Creating Goliath, with reserves of 12 million ounces, will
allow deeper resources to be developed without detracting from
Gold One’s plan of developing shallower projects, it said in a
statement today.  Goliath was created through the reverse acquisition of
 White Water Resources Ltd.  by Gold One, it said. Gold One will
own 73.9 percent of the new company.  Gold One’s Australian-listed shares rose 14 percent today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
