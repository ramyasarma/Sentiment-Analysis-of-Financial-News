Kenya Electricity Transmission Co. ,
the state-owned power-grid operator, plans to spend $1.2 billion
by 2014 expanding the network to import energy from neighboring
Ethiopia and provide a link to a wind farm in northern Kenya.  The project, which mainly will involve the installation of
high-voltage lines, will more than double the size of the
national grid,  Joel Kiilu , chief executive officer of Ketraco,
said in an interview from Nairobi, the capital, yesterday.  “The capital requirements and planning required to build
transmission lines as demand increases is massive,” Kiilu said.
“We are working to get access to as many people as possible, at
the cheapest rates.”  Ketraco was created by Kenya’s government in December 2008
to build and maintain new electricity-transmission lines as East
Africa’s biggest economy looks for ways to provide power to
areas where it’s in high demand and short supply. The company
took over the job from  Kenya Power and Lighting Co. , the
monopoly distributor that still controls 3,400 kilometers (2,113
miles) of power lines built before Ketraco was set up.  Kenya, with a population of 39 million, aims to increase
installed power capacity by almost nine-fold to 9,000 megawatts
over the next 20 years, while targeting a sustained annual
economic growth rate of 10 percent. The government expects to
grow by at least 4.5 percent in 2010 from 2.6 percent a year
earlier. Nairobi generates more than 60 percent of the country’s
gross domestic product.  South Africa, the continent’s biggest economy, has the
capacity to generate about 40,000 megawatts.  Indian Contract  Under the expansion plan,  Kalpataru Power Transmission Ltd. 
of India has a contract to build 450 kilometers of 400-kilovolt
and 220-kilovolt power lines. The cables will transmit power
from diesel-fed generators being installed around the port city
of Mombasa to Nairobi, Kiilu said. The total cost of the
project, which includes two sub-stations, is 100 million euros
($138 million,) he said.  The construction of a 500-kilovolt, 1,060-kilometer power
line linking Ethiopia with Kenya, as well as a 430-kilometer
link between the planned 300-megawatt Turkana Wind Farm and the
town of Suswa, about 100 kilometers northwest of Nairobi, should
be completed by the end of 2013, said Kiilu.  Kenya is in talks with Ethiopia to export as much as 500
megawatts of electricity, Mekuria Lemma, head of strategic
management at the state-owned Ethiopian Electric Power Corp.,
said on July 15. Ethiopia has Africa’s second-biggest potential
to exploit hydropower, after the  Democratic Republic of Congo ,
with the capacity to generate 45,000 megawatts, according to the
World Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
