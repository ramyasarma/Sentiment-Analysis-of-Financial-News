Petropavlovsk Plc’s   IRC Ltd. 
received orders for all the shares in its Hong Kong initial
public offering after delaying the sale and reducing the price,
according to two people familiar with the IPO.  The iron-ore unit of Russia’s third-largest gold producer
cut the offer price to HK$1.80 a share from a range of HK$2.20
to HK$3 and now has the entire book of 1.04 billion shares
covered at the reduced price, said one of the people, who
declined to be identified because the information isn’t public.  The bookrunners for the IPO,  Bank of America Corp. , UBS AG
and Bank of China International Holdings Ltd., will stop taking
orders at 5 p.m. in Hong Kong on Oct. 15, the person said.  At the lower price, IRC is seeking about HK$1.87 billion
($241 million), down from as much as HK$3.98 billion earlier.  IRC joins commodity producers including Moscow-based  United
Co. Rusal , the world’s largest aluminum maker, in raising funds
in Hong Kong as Chinese raw-material demand jumps. Petropavlovsk
said in a statement on Oct. 8 it had a shortage of investor
demand for the IRC IPO at the previous range.   Petropavlovsk , the London-based parent that will maintain a
65.6 percent holding of IRC after the offer, said yesterday that
it projects the share sale will raise about $222 million.  The company is seeking to develop iron ore assets it bought
last year. Petropavlovsk acquired the deposits in Russia when it
purchased the London-based iron ore explorer  Aricom Plc  for
294.5 million pounds ($467 million) in 2009, buying back a
company it spun off in 2003.   Petropavlovsk’s  shares rose 35 pence, or 3.5 percent, to
1,034 pence in London trading yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
