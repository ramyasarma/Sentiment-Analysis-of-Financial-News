Essar Energy Holdings  is likely to
win a bid to buy a 60 percent stake in the Zimbabwe Iron and
Steel Corp., known as Zisco, the  Herald  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The steel plant, which is not working, has debts of about
$400 million, the Harare-based state-owned newspaper said on its
website. The transaction must be approved by President  Robert Mugabe , Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai  and Deputy Prime
Minister  Arthur Mutambara , the Herald said.  Industry Minister  Welshman Ncube , who is coordinating the
bids, didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone or office when
Bloomberg sought comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
