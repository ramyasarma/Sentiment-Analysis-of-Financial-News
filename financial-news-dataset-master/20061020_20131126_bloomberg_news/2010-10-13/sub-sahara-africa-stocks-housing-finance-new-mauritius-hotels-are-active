Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index  rose for an
eighth day, the longest streak of gains in a year, climbing 1.2
percent to 1,836.43 by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis.  Kenya’s  All-Share Index  retreated 0.4 percent to 81.23 by
the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi. The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index  was little changed at 24,439.37 at the 1 p.m. close
in Lagos, according to an e-mailed statement from the exchange.
Namibia’s  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index  gained 2.9 percent to
833.28, the highest in six months, by the 5 p.m. close in
Windhoek, while the  Ghana Stock Exchange All-Share Index  snapped
two days of increases, dropping 0.1 percent to 6,862.41 by the
close at 1 p.m. in Accra.  The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Housing Finance Ltd.  (HFCL KN), Kenya’s only publicly
traded mortgage company, rose to the highest in more than two
years, increasing 50 cents, or 1.8 percent, to 27.75 shillings
after it was rated “buy” in new coverage by Nairobi-based
Genghis Capital Ltd.  Housing Finance “has enhanced its balance sheet through
the issue of a 10 billion-shilling ($124 million) medium-term
note program into the local fixed-income market to fund new
business,” the Nairobi-based brokerage said in an e-mailed note
to clients dated today. The company received 40 percent more
bids than the 5 billion shillings of bonds offered in a sale
last month, it said Oct. 6.  Kenya Airways Ltd.  (KNAL KN), sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest airline, advanced the most in more than two months,
adding 2.5 shillings, or 5.7 percent, to 46.75 shillings. The
carrier is in talks with its workers’ union to try to avert a
strike that was scheduled to start today, it said in an e-mailed
statement.  Kenya Electricity Generating Co.  (KEGC KN), the East
African nation’s biggest power producer, fell to the lowest
since May, retreating 80 cents, or 4.6 percent, to 16.75
shillings. Profit for the year through June dropped 5.3 percent
to 1.96 billion shillings ($24.2 million) from a year earlier
after output declined following a drought, the company said in a
statement today in the Nairobi-based Daily Nation.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd.  (NMH MP), the Indian Ocean island
nation’s biggest leisure group by market value, rose the most
since May, rallying 4 rupees, or 3.8 percent, to 109 rupees. The
euro strengthened versus the dollar today, improving prospects
for tourism to the country, Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at
AXYS Stockbroking Ltd., said by phone today.  Two-thirds of tourists to Mauritius are from Europe,
figures from the statistics office show. The euro appreciated
the most in a week to the dollar today, gaining 0.4 percent to
1.3976 by 4:35 p.m. in London. New Mauritius Hotels is
considered a reference for investors in the hotel industry,
which should receive a boost from the recent strengthening of
the euro versus the dollar.  United Bank for Africa Plc , (UBA NL), Nigeria’s fourth-
biggest lender, rose to the highest in a week, increasing 29
kobo, or 3.1 percent, to 9.69 naira.  More than 48.8 million shares changed hands, four times the
average daily volume for the last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. UBA’s increase pushed the  Bloomberg NSE
Banking Index  of the 10 most liquid lenders up 6.7 percent
today, the biggest increase since March.  “The stock is cheap relative to its peers in other
emerging markets,” Meristem analyst Abiola Razaq said by phone
from Lagos today. “UBA is trading at a price-to-book value of
1.25, compared to an emerging market average of 1.8 for its
peers,” he said. There were no major trades in the company’s
stock, United Bank of Africa said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
