Copper rose to a 27-month high in
New York and London on prospects for increased consumption of
the metal.  Average prices this quarter may be 10 percent higher than
in the prior three months as demand outpaces supply growth,
according to a state purchasing agency in South Korea, the
world’s fourth-biggest copper consumer. Codelco, the largest
producer, yesterday predicted a “tighter” market. Copper also
gained today as the dollar slumped.  “This morning is just a short-term reaction to a bit of
further dollar weakness,”  Leon Westgate , an analyst at Standard
Bank Plc in London, said by telephone.  Copper for delivery in December added 3.7 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.8265 a pound at 7:57 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The contract touched $3.8385, the highest price since July
8, 2008. Copper for delivery in three months climbed 0.7 percent
to $8,403 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and tin
advanced to a record.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, fell for a second day to near the lowest
level since January. A weaker dollar makes metals priced in the
currency cheaper in terms of other monies and fuels demand for
raw materials as an alternative investment.  ‘Very Strong’ Prices  Copper may average more than $8,000 a ton in the fourth
quarter, said Lee Key Man, head of the international goods
bureau at South Korea’s Public Procurement Service. That
compares with about $7,267 in the third quarter, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows. The metal may advance through 2011’s first
half, Lee said.  “The general consensus is that copper prices will be very
strong over the next couple of years,” Westgate said.  Demand from China, the world’s biggest consumer, and a lack
of new supply lie behind Santiago-based Codelco’s forecast,
Chief Executive Officer Diego Hernandez said. Prices will need
to stay higher than in the past for metals producers to cope
with rising costs and lower ore quality, he said.  Copper will average $8,438 a ton next year, compared with
$7,344 in 2010, said  Fred Demler , head of global commodities at
MF Global. The world is entering “a generally strong period for
all commodities,” and copper, aluminum, zinc and nickel will
all climb in next year’s first quarter, he said.  Imports Into China  “China remains the main driver of demand for metals,”
Commerzbank AG said in a research note today. The bank predicted
“imports at a relatively high level in the coming months,”
citing capacity reductions stemming from steps taken by the
government to save energy.  Still, imports of copper and products into China dropped
for the first time in three months in September as lower
domestic prices reduced the appeal of overseas purchases.
Shipments declined 2.9 percent from August to 368,410 tons, the
General Administration of Customs said.  LME copper  stockpiles  declined for a second day, slipping
0.1 percent to 371,275 tons, daily exchange figures showed.
Orders to draw copper from LME stocks, or canceled warrants,
fell 1 percent to 24,350 tons.  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME rose 0.2 percent to
$26,550 a ton after touching $27,100. The metal has jumped 57
percent this year, leading advances on the exchange, after
production was disrupted in Indonesia and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.  Lead rose 2.3 percent to $2,430 a ton after reaching
$2,440.25, the highest intraday price since Jan. 20. Nickel
climbed 1.2 percent to $24,350 a ton, aluminum was little
changed at $2,436.75 a ton and zinc rose 1.9 percent to $2,412 a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
