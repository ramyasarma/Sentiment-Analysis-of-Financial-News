Royal Bank of Canada plans to sell
debt due in December 2015 in a reopening of an earlier offering,
according to a person familiar with the transaction who declined
to be identified because terms aren’t set.  RBC sold $1 billion of the 2.625 percent securities in July
at a yield of 90 basis points more than similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
