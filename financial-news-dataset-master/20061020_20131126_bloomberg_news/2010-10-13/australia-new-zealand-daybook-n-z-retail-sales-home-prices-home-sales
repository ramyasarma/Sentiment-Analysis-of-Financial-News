---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES
New York: U.S. stocks rose, sending benchmark indexes to five-
month highs, as better-than-estimated results at CSX Corp. and
China’s record currency reserves boosted optimism in the
economic recovery.
*CSX, the second-largest publicly traded U.S. railroad,
rallied 4.7 percent after also saying it’s seeing improvements
across almost all markets.
*The S&P 500 rose 1 percent to 1,181.41 at 2:58 p.m. in New
York.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 112.47 points, or 1
percent, to 11,132.87.  London: European stocks advanced, climbing the most in six weeks,
after minutes from the Federal Reserve showed policy makers are
prepared to buy more government debt, and Intel Corp. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported earnings that topped estimates.
*Porsche SE gained the most in almost three months after the
carmaker narrowed its full-year loss.
*Standard Chartered Plc fell after the bank announced a 3.3
billion-pound share sale.
*The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 1.4 percent to
266.25 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London.  Tokyo: Japan’s Topix index fell, reversing gains with banks
leading the decline, as pessimism over the nation’s economic
outlook overshadowed expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will
take measures to revive growth.
*The Topix index slid 0.2 percent to 822.65 with about three
stocks dropping for every two that advanced at the 3 p.m. market
close in Tokyo.

changed at 4,619.90 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in
Sydney. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was also little changed at
3,231.82 at the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The yen fell against most of its major counterparts as
signs the global economic recovery is gathering momentum and a
boost in corporate earnings spurred demand for higher-yielding
assets.
*The yen declined for the first time in five days versus the
euro, depreciating 0.3 percent to 114.16 at 3:32 p.m. in New
York.
*The euro gained 0.2 percent to $1.3958, from $1.3924, after
touching $1.4001 earlier as Europe’s industrial production
rose 1 percent in August.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasury 30- and 10-year securities pared losses after
the Federal Reserve said it would purchase about $32 billion in
U.S. debt over the next month as it reinvests mortgage-holding
proceeds.
*The yield on the 30-year bond increased one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 3.83 percent at 3:14 p.m. in New York.
*Ten-year note yields were little changed at 2.43 percent  COMMODITIES  GOLD  New York: Gold rose to a record for the 15th time in the past
month as the slumping dollar boosted investor demand for the

percent, to settle at $1,370.50 an ounce at 1:55 p.m. on the

declined and the dollar fell, boosting demand for commodities as
alternative investments.

dropped 33 percent since March 1 to the lowest level in almost a
year.
*Copper futures for delivery in December gained 3.1 cents, or
0.8 percent, to close at $3.8205 a pound at 1:23 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price touched $3.841, the
highest level for a most-active contract since July 8, 2008.  OIL  New York: Crude oil rose for the first time in three days as

record crude imports in September, and the International Energy
Agency raised its global demand forecast.
*The IEA boosted its global crude-use outlook by 300,000 barrels
a day for 2010 and 2011.
*Crude for November delivery rose $1.37, or 1.7 percent, to
