German stocks advanced, with the
benchmark DAX Index closing at the highest level since September
2008, after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled policy makers are
prepared to buy more government debt.  ThyssenKrupp AG  and  Salzgitter AG , the country’s largest
steelmakers, followed metal prices higher. Infineon Technologies
AG advanced 2.6 percent as ASML Holding NV reported earnings
that beat analysts’ estimates. Porsche SE surged 5 percent after
the carmaker forecast a profit for 2011. Solar Millennium AG
dropped 11 percent, the most since August, after cutting its
outlook for the year.  The  DAX  gained 2.1 percent to 6,434.52 at the 5.30 p.m.
close in Frankfurt. The measure rallied 4.4 percent in the third
quarter as investors speculated that central banks will step in
to provide more stimulus for the ailing global recovery. The
broader  HDAX Index  rose 2.1 percent today.  “It seems that comments from the Fed gave the market the
last positive signal it needed to break old resistance levels
and reach a new year high,” said  Christian Falkner , an analyst
at Alpha Wertpapierhandels AG in Frankfurt. “We expect the
market to continue its ascent in the short term.”  U.S. benchmark indexes climbed to five-month highs
yesterday after the Fed published the minutes from its Sept. 21
meeting, showing that the central bank will be ready “before
long” to increase purchases of Treasuries, a tactic known as
quantitative easing. The Fed also discussed boosting inflation
expectations as a way to prop up the economy.  Steelmakers, Infineon  ThyssenKrupp and Salzgitter advanced 3.4 percent to 26.25
euros and 4.4 percent to 53.54 euros, respectively. Copper,
lead, nickel, tin and zinc all increased on the London Metal
Exchange.  Infineon,  Europe’s second-largest chipmaker , soared 2.6
percent to 5.49 euros, its highest price since April. ASML, the
region’s biggest semiconductor equipment maker, said third-
quarter profit rose to 268.5 million euros ($375.1 million),
beating the 247 million-euro average of 21 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The company also reiterated that 2010
sales will reach a record.  Larger U.S. rival Intel Corp. said it will generate $11.4
billion of fourth-quarter sales, plus or minus $400 million,
beating an average estimate of $11.3 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company cited strong demand from
businesses and customers in emerging economies.  Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank  Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s biggest bank, jumped 4 percent
to 41.65 euros, the stock’s first advance in five days. Smaller
competitor  Commerzbank AG  added 2.5 percent to 6.54 euros, the
stock’s highest closing price since August. JPMorgan Chase &
Co., the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, said third-quarter
net income rose 23 percent, more than analysts estimated, as
provisions for soured mortgages and credit-card loans declined.  Porsche, the maker of the 911 sports car, soared 5 percent
to 39 euros, the biggest gain since July. Porsche forecasts
breakeven for the last five months of 2010 and a profit in 2011
when the carmaker switches to calendar-year reporting. The net
loss in the 12 months ended July 31 narrowed to 454 million
euros from 3.56 billion euros a year earlier, the carmaker said.  Solar Millennium  sank 11 percent to 16.54 euros. The solar
company cut its sales forecast for the current fiscal year to
150 million euros from 350 million euros, and its earnings
before interest and taxes projection to “neutral or slightly
negative.”  Qiagen NV  rose 4.6 percent to 13.32 euros, the biggest
increase in 14 months, after the Dutch biotechnology company
said it entered into an agreement with Abbott Laboratories on
molecular tests.  To contact the reporters on this story:
