French Justice Minister  Michele Alliot-Marie  presented a bill to fix constitutional problems
posed by the current law governing police interrogations at a
meeting of President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s cabinet today.  The bill also aims to reduce the number of cases when
people are held by police, known as garde a vue, said  Luc Chatel , a spokesman for the government.  The current 800,000 annual detentions are “too many,”
Chatel said after the Paris meeting. The Constitutional Court
ordered the government to amend the law by July 31, finding
“some elements are contrary to the constitution.”  The bill limits detentions to crimes punishable with
imprisonment, bans full-body searches, requires police to inform
suspects of their right to remain silent, and allows lawyers to
stay throughout the interrogation. Currently they are limited to
a 30-minute visit at the start of a custody, which can last up
to 48 hours before a person must appear before a judge.  Presentation to the cabinet is the final step before a bill
goes before the parliament.  To contact the reporters on this story:
