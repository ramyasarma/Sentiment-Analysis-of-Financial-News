Canada’s dollar strengthened to near
parity with its U.S. counterpart, which was last reached in
April, as stocks and commodities gained and as new home prices
unexpectedly rose 0.1 percent in August.  Canada’s currency is the best performer this week among the
U.S. dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts, approaching parity
with the greenback for the first time since April 26. Finance
Minister  Jim Flaherty  said yesterday Canada will be the first
Group of Seven country to balance its budget by 2015.  “Commodity currencies have been the real outperformers at
the expense of the European currencies,” said  Shane Enright ,
executive director at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC
World Markets unit, said by phone from Toronto. “The equity
backdrop doesn’t hurt either.”  The currency appreciated 0.7 percent to C$1.0029 per U.S.
dollar at 2:04 p.m. in Toronto. It reached C$1.0011, the
strongest since April 27, from C$1.0101 yesterday. One Canadian
dollar buys 99.71 U.S. cents.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, reached parity
with its U.S. counterpart April 6 for the first time since July
2008 based on the prospect of higher interest rates and stronger
economic growth than in the U.S.  Home Gains  Canadian new home prices rose in August after a decline the
previous month, government figures showed.  The 0.1 percent advance reversed an identical loss in July,
and was led by a 0.9 percent rise for Hamilton, Ontario,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists predicted the
index would decline 0.1 percent, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of nine responses.  The MSCI Global Index of equities advanced 1.5 percent.
Crude oil for November delivery rose as much as 2.2 percent to
$83.45 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Gold traded in Canadian dollars rose as much as 1 percent
to C$1,376.90 an ounce, the highest price since at least 1971,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Copper prices rose to a
27-month high as inventories shrank and the dollar fell, with
futures for delivery in December adding 1.1 percent to $3.8315 a
pound on the Comex in New York.  Dollar Differences  Canada’s currency is up 2.5 percent during the past 30 days
versus the greenback, which has dropped against all of its 16
most-traded counterparts during that period. Traders are
speculating the Federal Reserve will announce plans to stimulate
economic growth, so-called quantitative easing, further debasing
the U.S. dollar.  “The combination of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher
commodity prices puts the Canadian dollar in a relatively
stronger position,”  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at
Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit, wrote via e-mail.
“With a lot of QE already priced into the market, and
speculators running a large U.S. dollar short position already,
it’s not obvious to me that we can make a significant new low in
U.S. dollar-Canada dollar at the moment,” Osborne said, meaning
the loonie may struggle to move much higher than parity.  Government bonds fell, pushing the yield on benchmark 10-
year bonds three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, higher
to 2.75 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing
in June 2020 dropped 24 cents to C$106.32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
