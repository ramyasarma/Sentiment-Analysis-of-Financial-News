Egyptian stocks advanced to the
highest level in five months, led by gains in basic materials
shares, after China said exports rose 25.1 percent in September
and the Federal Reserved signaled more economic stimulus.  Ezz Steel , the country’s biggest manufacturer of the metal,
gained 3.3 percent to 20.21 Egyptian pounds, the highest since
May 19.  Sidi Kerir Petrochemicals Co.  climbed 4.1 percent to
13.8 pounds, also a five-month high. Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30
Index  rose 1.1 percent to 6,900.97 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Cairo, the highest level since May 13.  “All our basic material stocks are up because we think
we’re going to see more demand from China and India,” said
 Tamer Nigm , head of sales and trading at Cairo-based Watheeqa
Securities Brokerage. “It matches the growing inflows we’re
seeing from investors in emerging markets.”  China’s customs bureau said exports rose 25.1 percent in
September, joining reports today showing gains in Japanese
machinery orders and Australia’s consumer confidence in
signaling the recovery in the Asian-Pacific region is
strengthening.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  added as much as 1.5
percent, on course for its biggest increase in a month. Federal
Reserve policy makers said in minutes of their Sept. 21 session
released yesterday that last month they were prepared to ease
monetary policy “before long.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
