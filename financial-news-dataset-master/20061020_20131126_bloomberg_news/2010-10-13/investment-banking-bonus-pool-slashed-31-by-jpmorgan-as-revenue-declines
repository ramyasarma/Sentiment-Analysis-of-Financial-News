JPMorgan Chase & Co.  slashed third-
quarter compensation for its investment-bank employees by 31
percent from the prior quarter as the company’s revenue
declined.  The firm set aside $2.03 billion for the period to pay
workers of its most profitable unit, 38 percent of the group’s
revenue, according to an earnings statement released today by
the New York-based bank. For the first nine months of the year,
the expense fell 10 percent to $7.88 billion from $8.79 billion
a year ago. That’s equal to $298,866 for each of the unit’s
26,373 workers at the end of September, down from $353,834 on
average for the division’s 24,828 employees a year ago.  JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, and other
Wall Street firms that hired workers in the last year had a drop
in fixed-income trading and investment-banking revenue. Expenses
at JPMorgan’s  investment bank  have risen 20 percent this year,
adding pressure to lower compensation.  “The economy has not come back as forecasted and so they
slowed hiring if not stopped hiring but they don’t want to fire
employees because business is coming back,” said  Jeanne Branthover , managing director at Boyden Executive Search Ltd., a
New York-based recruitment firm. “Instead, what they’re trying
to do is cut costs and do it through payment.”  JPMorgan’s investment bank has added 1,719 employees so far
this year, including 94 in the latest three month period,
according to today’s report. The company employed 236,810 people
at the end of the third quarter.  Investment Bank Income  JPMorgan’s third-quarter revenue fell 11 percent to $23.8
billion. The investment bank contributed $1.29 billion of the
firm’s $4.42 billion in  net income  in the third quarter, down
about 7 percent from the prior quarter and down 33 percent from
the same period a year earlier. The unit produces the largest
 profit  in the company, 42 percent higher than the second-biggest
division, retail financial services.  Investment banks set aside revenue throughout the year to
pay employees and typically decide bonuses at the end of the
year. For the first nine months, JPMorgan set aside 39 percent
of the investment-bank’s revenue to pay employees, compared with
38 percent a year ago.  “These people will be compensated and compensated well but
it’s not going to be the amounts it would be if they generated
more revenue,” Branthover said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
