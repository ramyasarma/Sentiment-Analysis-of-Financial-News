Lone Star Funds has started “a
process” to sell  IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG , the first
German lender bailed out by the state during the financial
crisis,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing  Bruno Scherrer , head of
European investments at the Dallas-based private equity firm.  Lone Star plans to talk to potential bidders in November
and considers a transaction likely during the first quarter of
2011, Scherrer told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
