Formula One’s ruling body approved a
newly-built racetrack in South Korea to hold the next round of
the series on Oct. 24.  Federation Internationale de l’Automobile race director
Charlie Whiting said the Yeongam circuit is “satisfactory,”
according to series website Formula1.com. It will be the first
time South Korea has held a Formula One race.  The Korean Grand Prix is the third-last race of the season.
