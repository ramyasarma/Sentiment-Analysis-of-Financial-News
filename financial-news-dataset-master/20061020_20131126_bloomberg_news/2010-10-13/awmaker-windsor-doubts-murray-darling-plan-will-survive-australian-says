Proposals to cut irrigation to
Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin, which produces most of the
nation’s fresh food, won’t see “the light of day” in this
three-year term of parliament, the Australian Financial
Review reported independent lawmaker Tony Windsor as saying.  Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s minority Labor government,
which relies on his support, should consider water efficiency,
storage of water underground and the diversion of water into the
basin because the social and economic costs of the current plans
are high, Windsor told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
