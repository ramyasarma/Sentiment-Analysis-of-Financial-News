German government bonds fell after
European Central Bank Council member  Axel Weber  said the ECB
should stop its bond-buying program and prepare to withdraw
other emergency measures.  The decline pushed the yield on the  10-year bund  up by the
most in almost two weeks, while two-year yields also climbed.
The risks associated with ending non-standard liquidity measures
too late are greater than those of exiting too early, Weber said
yesterday after euro-region bond markets closed. Germany sold
4.18 billion euros of 2.25 percent bonds maturing in September
2020, the current 10-year benchmark. European industrial output
expanded more than forecast in August, a report showed.  “The market is lower, reflecting Weber’s hawkish
comments,” said  Patrick Jacq , a senior fixed-income strategist
at BNP Paribas SA in Paris.  German 10-year yields were five basis points higher at 2.29
percent at 4:59 p.m. in London. The 2.25 percent security due
September 2020 fell 0.425, or 4.25 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,396)
face amount, to 99.68. Two-year yields climbed two basis points
to 0.79 percent.  The  Europe Stoxx 600 Index  of shares gained 1.4 percent,
the most in more than a week. The MSCI World Index added 1.3
percent. The cost of insuring against losses in European
corporate bonds fell, according to credit-default swaps.  Greek 10-year government bonds rose relative to benchmark
German bunds, narrowing the so-called yield spread by 34 basis
points to 645 basis points, after dropping to 644 points, the
least since June 15. The  Irish-German spread  was 11 basis points
narrower at 411 basis points, while the Portuguese spread
contracted by 13 points to 386.  Greek Rally  Greek 10-year bonds completed a 13th straight advance
yesterday after the nation cut its borrowing costs at a sale of
23-week Treasury bills. The yield on the 6.25 percent securities
due June 2020 was little changed at 9.13 percent today.  Greek bond trading on the electronic secondary securities
market, known as HDAT, climbed 120 percent to 1.8 billion euros
in September, according to the Bank of Greece. Of the 1,400
orders executed on HDAT, 57 percent were sell orders and 43
percent buy orders, the bank said.  German bunds have rallied since Sept. 17, pushing the yield
down more than 20 basis points from a 5-week high on speculation
the U.S. Federal Reserve will step up Treasury purchases. The
bund yield reached a record low 2.09 percent on Aug. 31.  German Sale  German bonds have returned 2.3 percent since June 30,
compared with 2.9 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 3.9 percent
for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Greek bonds handed investors 11 percent returns during the
period, while Irish securities lost 2.9 percent and Portuguese
debt 1.1 percent.  Germany sold the 10-year bonds at an average yield of 2.29
percent, compared with 2.39 percent at a previous sale of the
securities on Sept. 15, and 2.37 percent on Aug. 18. The
Bundesbank retained 819 million euros of the issue, versus 605
million in September and 990 million euros in August. Demand for
the securities outweighed supply by 1.4 times, less than the
previous bid-to-cover ratios of 1.8 and 1.6.  Output in the 16-member euro region increased 1 percent
from July, when it advanced 0.1 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had
forecast a gain of 0.8 percent, a Bloomberg survey showed.
 Production  rose 7.9 percent in the year.  Treasuries Fall  U.S. Treasuries were lower after a report that showed U.S.
mortgage applications climbed for the first time in six weeks.
The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index increased 15 percent in
the week ended Oct. 8, the Washington-based group said today.
Refinancing rose 21 percent, the most in four months, while
purchases decreased for the first time in three weeks.  The 10-year Treasury yield was four basis points higher at
2.48 percent, while the two-year yield was little changed at
0.37 percent.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
European companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped
7 basis points to 458, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 8
a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and a decline signals
improvement in perceptions of credit quality.  The rate at which European banks say they see each other
lending in euros for three months rose to the highest in more
than 14 months today, according to data from the European
Banking Federation.  The euro interbank offered rate, or  Euribor , for such loans
rose for the twelfth straight day to 0.985 percent. That’s the
highest since July 14, 2009 and up from 0.982 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
