Chile’s lower house of congress
approved a government proposal to raise taxes for mining
companies including  BHP Billiton Ltd.  and  Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc .  A majority of deputies voted in favor of all articles put
to a vote today, according to images transmitted by the lower
house television channel. The bill, approved in Senate 
yesterday, now requires presidential signing.  The changes would raise more than $1 billion over three
years to help fund earthquake reconstruction and President
 Sebastian Pinera ’s education and health programs, Finance
Minister  Felipe Larrain  said during the floor debate today.  “We’re convinced the mining sector can contribute more to
the country and to reconstruction,” Larrain said.  Under terms of the bill, companies would opt to transfer
from today’s fixed rate of 4 percent or 5 percent of operating
profit to a sliding scale of 4 percent to 9 percent through
2012. They would return to a fixed rate of 4 percent or 5
percent from 2013 to 2017 and move to a sliding scale of 5
percent to 14 percent through 2023.  The lower house approved an earlier version of the bill
Sept. 15 that called for a sliding scale of 5 percent to 9
percent from 2018 to 2025. The government changed the bill on
Oct. 6 after negotiating an agreement with the opposition, which
holds a majority in the Senate.  Congress in July failed to agree on a similar proposal for
mining taxes that was part of a package of measures designed to
raise funds for quake reconstruction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
