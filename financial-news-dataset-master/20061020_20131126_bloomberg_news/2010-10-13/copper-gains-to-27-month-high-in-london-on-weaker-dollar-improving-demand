Copper climbed to 27-month highs in
London and New York as demand prospects improved and as the
dollar declined. Lead gained to the highest level in six months.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose as
much as 0.8 percent to $8,415 a metric ton, the highest level
since July 2008, and was at $8,389.25 at 3:19 p.m. in Singapore.
The December-delivery contract on the Comex in New York gained
as much as 1.3 percent to $3.8385 a pound, also the highest
price since July 2008.  Chile’s Codelco, the world’s biggest copper producer,
expects a “tighter” market next year because of demand from
China and a lack of new supply, Chief Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez  said yesterday.  “There’s no stopping the bullishness in the market right
now and there’s this frantic buying into commodities as the
dollar continues to weaken,” Huang Wei, an analyst at Jicheng
Futures Co., said from Guangdong. “The fundamentals are
definitely improving, especially for copper. However, they
aren’t so good as to justify the current prices.”  January-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained as much as 1.8 percent to 63,350 yuan ($9,501) a ton.
China is the world’s largest metals user.  The metal in London has risen 9.7 percent in the past month
as the  dollar  tumbled 5.8 percent against a six-currency basket
on increasing speculation the Federal Reserve will take further
measures to protect the economic recovery. Copper inventories
monitored by the LME, down 26 percent this year, are at their
lowest level in a year.  Fed Minutes  In the minutes of their September meeting, Fed policy
makers said they were prepared to ease monetary policy “before
long” and focused on purchases of Treasury securities and
boosting inflation expectations. The minutes of the meeting were
released yesterday.  “The market is quite tight and next year it should
continue to be tight,” Hernandez said in an interview. China
“has kept quite firm demand,” he said.  On the supply side, a deterioration of the quality of ore
and lack of investments in mines, exacerbated by the financial
crisis in 2008, will keep prices at current levels “for a
while,” said Hernandez. The long-term price of copper may be
about $2.30 a pound, he said.  Copper prices may average more than $8,000 a ton in the
fourth quarter of this year, 10 percent higher than the
$7,266.78 average in the third quarter, according to a state
purchasing agency in South Korea, Asia’s third-biggest base
metals buyer.  “Despite a fast pace in the global economic recovery this
year, supply growth for copper seems to have been very slow,”
Lee said. “The metal is likely to advance to higher levels on
slowing supply growth amid excessive liquidity in global
markets.”  China’s Imports  China’s copper imports dropped for the first time in three
months to 368,410 tons in September from 379,527 tons in August,
as lower domestic prices reduced the appeal of overseas
purchases. The country also imported 410,000 tons of scrap
copper, up 2.5 percent from 400,000 tons in August, the General
Administration of Customs said on its website today.  Higher scrap imports and the shutting of a smelter in India
helped to reduce the demand for refined metal and ease the
supply shortage in the concentrates market, according to
Shenzhen Rongtuo Trading Co. Concentrate is semi-processed ore.  This led to a jump in processing fees, paid by miners to
smelters to turn ore into refined metal, to as high as $80 a ton
for smelting and 8 cents a pound for refining, up from about $20
to $30 a ton a month ago, said China International Futures
(Shanghai) Co. analyst  Fang Junfeng .  Zinc in London rose as much as 1.3 percent to $2,399.75 a
ton, and lead gained as much as 1.2 percent to $2,403.50 a ton,
both the highest levels since April. Nickel climbed 1.4 percent
to $24,385 a ton, aluminum was little changed at $2,434.75 a ton,
while tin dropped 0.8 percent to $26,300 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
