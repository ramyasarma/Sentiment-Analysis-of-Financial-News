Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. , a
Kazakh producer of ferroalloys, said it plans to boost copper
production from its assets in Africa by more than six-fold
during the next three years.  ENRC, which has spent more than $1.2 billion buying copper
companies in Africa, plans to produce 20,000 metric tons of the
metal this year before increasing output to 130,000 tons in
2013, according to written notes accompanying a presentation by
Chief Commercial Officer  Jim Cochrane  in London today.  The company, looking to diversify beyond Kazakhstan, agreed
in February to buy Zambian copper and cobalt company Chambishi
Metals Plc and last year purchased Central African Mining &
Exploration Co., which operates in the Democratic Republic of
Congo. In August, it acquired rights to the Kolwezi copper and
cobalt project, also in Congo.  ENRC expects to spend about $340 million to achieve its
130,000-ton copper production target, according to today’s
presentation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
