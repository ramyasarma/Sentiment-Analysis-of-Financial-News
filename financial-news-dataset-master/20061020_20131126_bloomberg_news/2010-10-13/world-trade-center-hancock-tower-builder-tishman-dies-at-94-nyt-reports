Robert Tishman , whose company
developed the World Trade Center in New York and the John
Hancock Tower in Chicago, died at the age of 94, the New York
Times reported, citing Tishman’s daughter Lynne Handler.  Tishman founded  Tishman Speyer Properties LP  in 1978 with
his son-in-law,  Jerry Speyer , the Times said. The company was an
offshoot of Tishman Realty and Construction, a business created
by his grandfather, Julius, the paper said.  The New York-based company, which owns the Rockefeller
Center, has built 325 projects and currently has a portfolio of
properties valued at more than $50 billion, the Times said. Its
developments include the NBC Tower in Chicago, the MesseTurm in
Frankfurt and the Torre Norte in Sao Paulo in Brazil, Latin
America’s tallest building.  Tishman was a graduate of Cornell University and served in
the U.S. Navy in the Pacific in World War II. He is survived by
two daughters, six grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.  To contact the reporter on this story:
