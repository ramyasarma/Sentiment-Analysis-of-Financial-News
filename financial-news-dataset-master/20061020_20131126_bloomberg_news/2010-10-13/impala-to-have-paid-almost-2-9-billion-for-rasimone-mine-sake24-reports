Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. was
prepared to offer just less than 20 billion rand for the
Bafokeng nation’s Rasimone mine, Sake24 reported, citing Royal
Bafokeng Holdings Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Niall Carroll.  The mine was valued at between 9 billion rand and 11
billion rand in preparation for the planned sale of shares on
Johannesburg’s stock exchange, the newspaper reported. Anglo
Platinum owns about a third of Rasimone and vetoed Impala’s
purchase of the mine yesterday. Carroll told Johannesburg-based
Sake24 that Anglo Platinum’s veto right is only valid for two
years and that there is nothing to stop Impala from buying the
mine once that expires.  Impala’s offer would have offered a 50 percent premium on
the Royal Bafokeng Platinum Ltd. unit’s listing price, Sake24
cited Carroll as saying, without disclosing the price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
