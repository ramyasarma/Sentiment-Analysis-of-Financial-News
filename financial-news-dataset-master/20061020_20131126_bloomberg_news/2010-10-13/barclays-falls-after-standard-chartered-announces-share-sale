Barclays Plc  dropped in London
trading after rival U.K. bank Standard Chartered Plc announced a
3.3 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) share sale to bolster capital.  The bank  fell  0.9 percent to 292 pence at the close, its
lowest since July 21. That made Barclays the fourth-biggest
faller in the 54-member  Bloomberg Europe Banks Index .  The question now “is quite simply whether the Standard
Chartered move is going to be the thin end of the wedge,” said
 Richard Hunter , head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown
stockbrokers. “Barclays is potentially being seen as the next
one who might need to make a similar announcement to improve
their capital buffer.”  Barclays President  Robert Diamond  said that while Basel III
rules will affect the bank’s ability to generate earnings, it
won’t need additional funding from shareholders.  “From what we know and can see today, we believe we have
enough equity capital and it is not our objective to turn to
shareholders for more,” Diamond said on Sept. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
