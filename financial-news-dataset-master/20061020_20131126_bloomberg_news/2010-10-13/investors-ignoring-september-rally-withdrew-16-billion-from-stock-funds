Investors removed $16 billion from
U.S. stock funds last month even as the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  posted its best September since 1939, according to data
from Morningstar Inc.  International stock funds attracted $1.5 billion in
September, while bond funds collected $26 billion, Chicago-based
Morningstar said today in a report. Investors withdrew money
from U.S. stock funds despite an 8.8 percent increase in
September, the biggest gain for the month in 71 years.  Investors have removed $84 billion from U.S. stock funds
since the beginning of 2009, favoring the perceived safety of
bonds over a 74 percent rebound in stocks from their March 9,
2009, low. Withdrawals accelerated after the stock-market plunge
on May 6, with investors pulling $65 billion from mutual funds
that buy U.S. equities since April, Morningstar’s data show.
Investors have poured about $221 billion into bond funds and $22
billion into non-U.S. stock funds this year.  Money-market funds have had withdrawals of $873 billion
since the beginning of 2009 as interest rates have stayed close
to zero.  To contact the reporter on this story:
