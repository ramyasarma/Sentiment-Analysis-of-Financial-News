Lloyds Banking Group Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest mortgage lender, is cutting about 4,500 jobs in its
administrative and information technology divisions as it seeks
to reduce costs after the acquisition of HBOS Plc two years ago.  The job cuts, which will reduce staff numbers by at least
25 percent at the bank’s IT division, is the result of IT-system
integration of the two lenders, the London-based bank said in a
statement. The job losses affect about 1,600 U.K.-based
permanent staff and about 1,750 offshore contractors.  “It is an absolute disgrace that Lloyds, which is being
kept alive by the taxpayer, is cutting more jobs,” Cath
Speight, national officer for the  Unite  union, said in a
statement.  Lloyds has said it plans to reduce costs by 2 billion
pounds ($3 billion) annually over the next two years following
the 2008 HBOS takeover. Losses at HBOS caused Lloyds to cede a
41 percent stake to the government.  “Today marks another major step in bringing our businesses
together,”  Mark Fisher , director of group operations at Lloyds,
said in the statement. “We have mitigated the impact on
permanent staff with a significant release of temporary and
contract staff.”  Lloyds Trade Union, the largest trade union operating at
the bank, said that the bank has cut 22,800 jobs since the HBOS
takeover, “with thousands more expected.” The bank had 106,000
full-time employees as of June 30.  The job cuts will involve offices in Edinburgh, Halifax,
Leeds and Chester, the trade union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
