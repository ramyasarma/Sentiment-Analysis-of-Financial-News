A fire at an Iranian military base
detonated ammunition, causing an explosion that killed 18 people
and wounded 14, a Revolutionary Guards commander said.  “The accident happened at 11 a.m. yesterday due to a fire
that reached an ammunition storage and caused an explosion,”
Yadollah Buali, the Revolutionary Guards commander in western
Lorestan province said, according to the state-run  Fars  news
agency.  Buali didn’t specify whether the casualties at the base in
Lorestan were soldiers or employees.  The official Islamic Republic News Agency said yesterday
that a blast took place in the western city of Khorramabad and
wounded several soldiers. Khorramabad is the capital of Lorestan
province.  Iran’s northwestern border areas are the scene of frequent
clashes between the army and fighters of the Party for a Free
Life in Kurdistan, or PJAK, which is affiliated with the
Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK. Iran’s government is concerned
that its Kurdish population may seek autonomy similar to that of
its neighbors in northern Iraq.  To contact the reporter on this story:
