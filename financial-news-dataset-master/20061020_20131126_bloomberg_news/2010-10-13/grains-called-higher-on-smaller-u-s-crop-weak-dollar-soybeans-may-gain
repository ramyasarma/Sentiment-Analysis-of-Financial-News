What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on renewed concern that
U.S. production will shrink after adverse weather hurt yields
and as a weaker dollar boosts demand from overseas buyers, said
 Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des
Moines, Iowa.  -- Wheat futures may open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as the higher cost of corn increases the use of
wheat in livestock feed, Roose said.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on increased Chinese demand and as a weaker dollar
boosts investor buying, Roose said. Soybean-meal futures may
open $2 to $3 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to open up 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
