OAO Seventh Continent owner
Alexander Zanadvorov agreed to buy a 21.3 percent stake from
Russian lawmaker Vladimir Gruzdev’s family fund for about $400
million,  Vedomosti  said, citing an unidentified person close to
the fund.  Zanadvorov, who will hold 96 percent of the Russian food
retailer after the deal, may then boost his stake to 100 percent
by buying shares from minority shareholders, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
