U.S. farm exports may surpass a 2008
record of $115.3 billion on surging corn, soybean and wheat
prices, according to  Joe Glauber , the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s chief economist.  Exports may exceed the August forecast of $113 billion for
the year that began Oct. 1, Glauber said today in a telephone
interview.  “We very well could exceed the record if prices increase
by enough,” Glauber said. Rising prices shouldn’t deter foreign
buyers enough to reduce exports significantly because of high
demand for U.S. goods, he said. “We’re the only game in town”
for wheat, after Russia halted exports following a drought, he
said.  Corn, wheat and soybeans traded in Chicago have surged
since June as a weaker dollar made U.S. crops more attractive to
overseas buyers and on USDA forecasts for smaller supplies.  Through yesterday, corn gained 61 percent from the end of
May, soybeans climbed 26 percent and wheat was up 55 percent.
The  dollar  during that period dropped 11 percent against a
basket of six competing currencies.  Rising trade will contribute to a projected 24 percent gain
in net farm income this calendar year to $77.1 billion, the USDA
said in a  report  in August. The department will update its
forecast for agricultural trade in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
