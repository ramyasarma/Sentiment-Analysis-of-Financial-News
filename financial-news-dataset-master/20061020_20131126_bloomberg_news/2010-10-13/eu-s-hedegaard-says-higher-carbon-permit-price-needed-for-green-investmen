European Union Climate Commissioner
 Connie Hedegaard  comments on the outlook for the price of EU
carbon-dioxide allowances should the bloc fail to deepen its
target to reduce emissions by 20 percent in 2020 compared with
1990.  Hedegaard spoke today at a conference in Brussels.  “If we just stay at the 20 percent, the carbon price will
continue up to 2020 -- according to our calculations -- to be so
low that the incentive for investors to go into this business
will not be there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
