A Bayer AG unit carelessly
contaminated U.S. long-grain rice fields with its genetically
engineered seed, causing Texas growers to lose the European
market, a lawyer told a St. Louis jury.  “Bayer brought its experimental rice to this country from
Belgium, even though it was not approved for human consumption
here,” attorney Don Downing said in his opening statements in
the seventh such trial against the German company and its Bayer
CropScience unit. “Bayer was not careful. It escaped, and the
farmers were hurt.”  The company has lost six trials so far, three in state
court and three in federal, for a total of about $54 million in
jury awards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
