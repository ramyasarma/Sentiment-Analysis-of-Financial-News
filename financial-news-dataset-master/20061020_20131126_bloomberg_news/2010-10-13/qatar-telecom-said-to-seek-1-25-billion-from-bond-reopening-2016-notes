Qatar Telecom  is seeking to raise
between $1 billion and $1.25 billion by selling 15-year bonds
and reopening last week’s issue of notes due in 2016, said two
people with knowledge of the deal.  The company is selling more bonds after “high” demand and
“attractive pricing” for its previous issue, it said in an e-
mailed statement today. Qatar Telecom last week raised $1.5
billion from a two-part bond sale after receiving investor
orders for $15 billion.  Qatar Telecom may offer $500 million to $750 million of
dollar-denominated bonds due in October 2025 at a yield between
262.5 and 267.5 basis points over 10-year Treasuries, according
to the people, who declined to be identified because the
transaction isn’t completed. It may also offer $500 million of
its existing bonds due October 2016 at a price of about 100.15
cents on the dollar, according to the people.  A revival of investor confidence in the Middle East helped
spur Gulf issuance to more than $9 billion in the third quarter,
the most for a quarter since borrowers raised $16 billion in the
final three months of 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Such re-tap and ‘drive by’ deals are rare in this market
and are an indication of how hot emerging-market bonds are these
days,” said  Abdul Kadir Hussain , chief executive officer in
Dubai at Mashreq Capital DIFC Ltd. This deal is “further
evidence of how much cash there is out there to invest in high-
quality borrowers from the region,” he said.  ‘Second Bite’  The Doha-based company last week sold $1 billion of 4.75
percent notes due in 2021 priced to yield 245 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It also issued $500 million of six-year, 3.375
percent notes priced at a 235 basis-point spread, the data show.
Qatar Telecom said it would use the money to refinance debt and
for general corporate purposes.  “The new 15-year is an opportunity for a second bite at the
cherry,”  Norval Loftus , chief investment officer of London-based
Allegra Asset Management. “The credit quality, yield pick-up on
offer and the duration is attractive and given the previous deal
worked like a dream a few days ago, it all adds up to be a blow-
out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
