Solar Millennium AG , the maker of
parabolic solar-power equipment, fell the most since March in
Frankfurt after reducing its annual forecasts.  The manufacturer cut its sales outlook for the current
fiscal year to 150 million euros ($210 million) from 350 million
euros, and its earnings before interest and tax forecast to
“neutral or slightly negative.”  The lower forecasts come after delays by the U.S. Energy
Department and other authorities in providing loan guarantees
for a project to build solar thermal-based electricity
generating plants in California. The solar power plants in
Blythe will be the world’s largest.  The shares were  down  10 percent at 16.70 euros as of 9:40
a.m. local time, valuing the Erlangen, Germany-based company at
about 209 million euros. The stock has lost 53 percent so far
this year.  Solar Millennium on Sept. 13 said it lost 26.7 million
euros in the eight months through June 30, compared with a
profit of 20.9 million euros in the year-earlier period.  The company has been burdened by unspecified one-time
charges in connection with payments to former CEO  Utz Claassen 
as well as delays with a solar-power generating station being
built in Spain, it said at the time.  Of the six analysts who cover the company, four rate the
stock “hold” and two say investors should buy the shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
