JPMorgan Chase & Co ., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, named  Douglas Petno  chief operating
officer for commercial banking.  Petno was previously head of investment banking for natural
resources companies, JPMorgan said in an internal memorandum on
Sept. 30. Its contents were confirmed by spokeswoman  Tasha Pelio.   A veteran investment banker, Petno advised Exxon Mobil
Corp. on its $31 billion purchase of XTO Energy Inc., and has
been part of the JPMorgan team counseling BHP Billiton Ltd. this
year on its $40 billion hostile pursuit of Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan.  Petno is being replaced by  Eric Stein , previously head of
investment banking in North America for clients in “diversified
industries” such as General Electric Co., JPMorgan said in the
memo.  Kelly Coffey , the former head of corporate derivatives
marketing for North America, takes Stein’s role.  To contact the reporter on this story:
