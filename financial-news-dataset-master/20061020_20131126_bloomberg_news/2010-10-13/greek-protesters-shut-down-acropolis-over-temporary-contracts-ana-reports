Greek protesters blocked entry to
the Acropolis archaeological site in the capital of Athens this
morning, state-run Athens News Agency reported.   The protest was organised by workers on short-term
contracts at the Culture Ministry who are demanding they be
given permanent positions, ANA said, citing comments from a
union representative. The protests will continue all month, the
newswire said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
