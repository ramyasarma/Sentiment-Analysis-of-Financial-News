A cadre of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
traders in Asia preparing to start their own hedge fund hired
 Roger Denby-Jones , a former prime broker at the investment bank,
as their firm’s chief operating officer, four people with
knowledge of the matter said.  Denby-Jones, 46, will become COO of the new Hong Kong-based
hedge-fund firm to be led by  Morgan Sze , global head of Goldman
Sachs’s principal strategies business, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private. He will
help to set up the company, though he won’t be a Goldman Sachs
employee, they added.  Banks including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are
complying with the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul act in the U.S.
that prohibits them from risking capital by betting for their
own accounts. Goldman Sachs, which makes about 10 percent of its
 revenue  from proprietary trading, decided to disband the
principal-strategies business, two people with knowledge of the
decision said last month.  IRC Gets IPO Orders  Petropavlovsk Plc’s   IRC Ltd.  received orders for all the
shares in its Hong Kong initial public offering after delaying
the sale and reducing the price, according to two people
familiar with the IPO.  The iron-ore unit of Russia’s third-largest gold producer
cut the offer price to HK$1.80 a share from a range of HK$2.20
to HK$3 and now has the entire book of 1.04 billion shares
covered at the reduced price, said one of the people, who
declined to be identified because the information isn’t public.  The bookrunners for the IPO,  Bank of America Corp. , UBS AG
and Bank of China International Holdings Ltd., will stop taking
orders at 5 p.m. in Hong Kong on Oct. 15, the person said.  Communist Party Plenum  China’s Communist Party elite gather in Beijing tomorrow in
the wake of a public challenge from retired officials who accuse
some leaders of censoring calls by Premier  Wen Jiabao  for
greater political openness.  The 200-odd Central Committee  members  are set to discuss
personnel changes and a new five-year economic plan that starts
in 2011. Vice President  Xi Jinping  may take a position on the
party’s military commission, paving the way for him to replace
General Secretary and President  Hu Jintao , who steps down in
late 2012, political analysts say.  In the run-up to the plenum, Wen has called for a
relaxation of state control of social and political affairs. At
last year’s session, Hu advocated more “intra-party
democracy,” to give lower-level officials a greater hand in
appointments and policymaking.  MARKETS:  U.S. stocks rose, sending benchmark indexes to five-month
