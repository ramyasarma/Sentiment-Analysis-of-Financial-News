Canadian stocks  fell for the first
time in four days, led by energy producers, after the U.S.
reported an increase in  initial jobless claims .  Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s biggest oil and gas producer,
retreated 1.7 percent as crude futures slipped after reaching a
one-week high yesterday. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest
gold producer, dropped 0.7 percent as an  index  of gold-mining
companies declined from a record level. Silver reseller Silver
Wheaton Corp. increased 1.8 percent as the metal climbed to a
30-year high.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  lost 53.62 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 12,619.69, coming off a two-year high.  Commodity stocks “moved ahead of the commodities because
investors wanted to get money working,” said  Irwin Michael , who
helps manage C$1 billion ($995 million) as a money manager at
ABC Group of Funds in Toronto. “They bought what was cheap. Now
the commodity has moved up and people now have backed off
because the market had a good run.”  The S&P/TSX is heading for a fifth-straight weekly gain for
the first time since April 2009. An index of commodities gained
8.9 percent during the streak through yesterday as the U.S.
dollar declined 6.8 percent amid concerns that new stimulus
measures will weaken the currency. Energy and raw-materials
companies make up 48 percent of Canadian stocks by market value.  U.S. jobless claims rose by 13,000 to 462,000 last week,
the Labor Department said today in Washington. Economists had
forecast a figure of 445,000, according to the median of 47
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Oil Supplies  The  S&P/TSX Energy Index  declined after three days of gains
as the U.S. reported supplies fell by 416,000 barrels last week,
less than the American Petroleum Institute estimated yesterday.  Suncor lost 1.7 percent to C$34.72. Pacific Rubiales Energy
Corp., which produces oil and gas in Colombia, decreased 2.9
percent from a record level to C$30. Talisman Energy Inc., an
oil and gas producer with operations in  North America, the North
Sea and Indonesia , slumped 1.3 percent to C$18.18.  The S&P/TSX Gold Index retreated 0.7 percent as the metal
fell 0.9 percent from the intraday record of C$1,388.10 reached
before the TSX opened today.  Barrick dropped 0.7 percent to C$49.09. Agnico-Eagle Mines
Ltd., Canada’s fifth-largest gold producer, declined 1.1 percent
to C$73.67.  Lake Shore Stake  Lake Shore Gold Corp., which explores for the metal in
Canada, declined 5.4 percent to C$3.50 after Hochschild Mining
plc said it agreed to reduce its stake in the company to 6
percent from 35 percent. Hochschild, Peru’s second-largest
silver producer, will sell 109 million shares at C$3.60 a share.  Silver Wheaton, which buys silver mined by other companies
as a byproduct, advanced  1.8 percent  to a record C$28.10 as the
metal rallied 2.6 percent. Silvercorp Metals Inc., which mines
in China, surged 5.9 percent to a two-year high of C$9.48.  The ratio of the price of gold to that of silver dropped to
the lowest since August 2008 as investors sought a precious
metal that may also benefit from economic growth.  Taseko Mines Ltd., which mines copper in British Columbia,
sank 11 percent to C$6.21 after earlier today plunging as much
as 34 percent. In a press release, the company said “it is
unaware of any information that would cause the price of the
company’s stock to change materially.”  The Canadian government has yet to issue an approval or
denial of Taseko’s proposed Prosperity project, Nancy Bishay, a
spokeswoman for Fisheries and Oceans Minister  Gail Shea , said in
a telephone interview. Some environmental and indigenous groups
oppose the project.  BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. declined 1.6
percent to C$49.45 after Verizon Wireless, the biggest U.S.
wireless carrier, said it will start selling Apple Inc.’s iPad
at more than 2,000 company stores beginning Oct. 28. RIM shares
have slumped 30 percent this year, the second-biggest decline
after Manulife Financial Corp. in an  index  of 60 of the largest
and most-liquid S&P/TSX stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
