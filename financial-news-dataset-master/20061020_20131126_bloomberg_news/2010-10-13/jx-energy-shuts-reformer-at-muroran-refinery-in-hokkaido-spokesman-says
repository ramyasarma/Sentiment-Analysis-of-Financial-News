JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp.  shut
the 36,000 barrel-a-day reformer and the 65,000 barrel-a-day
naphtha desulfurizer at its Muroran refinery in Hokkaido, an
official who requested anonymity said.  The reformer and desulfurizer were shut yesterday because
of a gas leak in the desulfurizer. The company doesn’t know when
the units will start operations. The 180,000 barrel-a-day crude
distillation unit is running normally, the official said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
