Kesa Electricals Plc  rose as much as
14 percent in London trading on speculation that the operator of
Comet electronics stores in the U.K. may be a takeover target.  Best Buy may make an offer, the Financial Times Alphaville
column said, without saying whether it was referring to Best Buy
Co. or Best Buy Europe, a joint venture between the Richfield,
Minnesota-based company and  Carphone Warehouse Group Plc .  Kesa shares climbed as much as 21.5 pence to 172.4 pence in
London, the steepest advance since April 2, 2009. A spokesman
for Kesa declined to comment. Best Buy Europe “never coments on
speculation or rumor,” spokesman  Shane Conway  said. Messages
left with Best Buy spokespeople weren’t immediately returned.  Best Buy Europe is the continent’s largest mobile-phone
retailer, with more than 2,400 stores in nine countries. It has
opened four Big Box stores in the U.K this year with two more
planned for November, and is starting a website in the fall.  A deal “seems unlikely,” said  Andy Wade , an analyst at
Numis Securities in London. “I’m not convinced that it makes
total sense,” he said by phone.  Kesa was up 10.3 pence, or 6.8 percent, to 161.2 pence at
3:54 p.m. local time. The  stock  has climbed 8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
