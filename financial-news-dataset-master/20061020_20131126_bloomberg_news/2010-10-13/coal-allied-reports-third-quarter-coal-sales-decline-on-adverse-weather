Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. , the
Australian coal unit of Rio Tinto Group, cut its annual
production forecast by as much as 7 percent because of adverse
weather.  Output in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 15 percent
to 4.23 million metric tons, Coal & Allied said today in a
statement. That was down from 4.99 million tons a year ago
because of wet weather, it said.  Production and  sales  for the year may be between 25 million
tons and 26 million tons, it said. In July, the Brisbane-based
company had a forecast of 27 million tons.  “The continued impact of adverse weather has led to a
reduction in full year production and sales expectations,” the
company said.  Sales gained 3 percent after ships that were delayed in the
second quarter were loaded in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
