Shanghai’s property stocks gauge
rose the most since May 24 as trade data bolstered the outlook
for the nation’s economy and analysts said shares were
undervalued after declines this year.  “Valuations of property stocks are low,” said Shen
Aiqin,  an analyst at GF Securities Co. in Guangzhou
“As investors turn more optimistic about the economy,
these cyclical stocks such as developers are what investors
buy aggressively.” He has an “overweight” rating on the
property industry. The property gauge gained 4.3 percent, the
most since May 24.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
