Cencosud SA , Chile’s largest
retailer by sales, gained the most in almost two months and led
increases among members of the IPSA index after BBVA initiated
coverage of the company with a “market outperform” rating and
set a price estimate for 2011 of 3,670 pesos.  Cencosud rose 3.6 percent to 3,240.1 pesos at 1:57 p.m. New
York time, the largest increase since Aug. 16. The  IPSA index 
rose 2 percent to 4,757.91, the largest increase since May 10.  Favorable economic conditions in the region, the company’s
“solid” financial situation, growing margins and its
“strong” growth in the supermarkets business will translate
into profit growth in the next years, analyst  Raul Barros  wrote
in an e-mailed note to clients.  BBVA expects Cencosud to invest between $800 million and
$900 million per year up to 2012, and earnings before items to
post a compounded annual growth rate of 16 percent up to 2015.  “The favorable economic scenario and the investment
program could lead Cencosud to trade above its historical
multiples,” the analyst wrote. Cencosud has traded at an
average price to earnings ratio of 18.4, and should reach 23.3
times on an estimated price to earnings ratio in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
