Cricket’s governing body ended a
probe of scoring in the Sept. 17 one-day cricket match between
England and Pakistan, saying it found “no compelling evidence
to suspect individual players or support staff” of cheating.  “The investigation is now complete but if new and
corroborating evidence comes to light then clearly the Anti
Corruption and Security Unit will re-open the matter,” the
International Cricket Council said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The probe began the day after Pakistan’s 23-run victory in
the third one-day international between the sides at the Oval
in London. The ICC investigated after a tip from the Sun
newspaper, which had a source inform it that “a certain
scoring pattern would emerge during certain stages of the match
and, broadly speaking, that information appeared to be
correct,” ICC President Haroon Lorgat said at the time.  The ICC is trying to reform the Pakistan board after
several investigations into alleged misdeeds by the country’s
team this summer. Pakistan captain Salman Butt and fast bowlers
Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were charged with anti-
corruption violations by the ICC last month and suspended. The
players have denied the charges, and their case will be heard at
the end of October.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
