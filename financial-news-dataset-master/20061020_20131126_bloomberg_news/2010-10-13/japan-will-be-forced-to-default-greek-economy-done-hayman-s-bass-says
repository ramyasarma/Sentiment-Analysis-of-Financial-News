Japan will be forced to default on
its debt, Greece’s economy is “done” and Iceland is worse off
than Greece, said J.  Kyle Bass , the head of Dallas-based Hayman
Advisors LP who made $500 million in 2007 on the U.S. subprime
collapse.  Nations around the world will be unable to repay their debt
and financial austerity in a country such as Ireland is “too
late,” Bass said today at the Value Investing Congress in New
York.  Japan’s economy may unravel in the next two to three years,
and its interest payments will exceed revenue, he said. “Japan
can’t fund itself internally,” Bass said.  The country’s year-over-year gross domestic product was 2.4
percent as of June 30. It has the world’s largest public debt,
approaching 200 percent of its GDP amid a 5.1 percent jobless
rate.  Consumer price  fell by one percent in September and has
been negative each month since May 2009, as deflation has taken
hold.  Pricing on Japanese interest-rate swaps is the best he’s
ever seen, Bass said. Investors could make 50 to 100 times their
capital betting on them, he said, calling them a lottery ticket
on Japan’s economy.  Japanese bonds have returned 3.3 percent this year,
according to Merrill Lynch Indexes, compared with a return of
0.872 percent in 2009.  Crisis  Bank Of Japan’s Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  refused to
expand monthly purchases of government bonds this year even as
deflation persisted. The bank on Oct. 5 instead created a 5
trillion yen ($60 billion) fund to buy bonds and other assets,
and pledged to keep its benchmark interest rate at “virtually
zero” until the end of deflation is in sight. Deflation has
been entrenched in the economy since 1998. The GDP deflator, a
gauge of prices across the economy, has fallen 14 percent since
1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A financial crisis in 1997-98 precipitated by bad loans on
Japanese lenders’ balance sheets stemming from burst land and
stock-price bubbles of the early 1990s set off Japan’s
deflation.  Property prices  have slumped for 17 of the past 19
years, and stocks remain 76 percent off of their 1989 peak,
according to the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average .  Japan’s currency traded at 81.79 per dollar, compared with
81.72. It touched 81.39 on Oct. 11, the strongest level since
April 1995.  Bass began buying securities with shorter durations last
year as he predicted central bank and government actions
globally to rescue the financial system will result in
“outright currency debasement.”  He began buying shorter-term debt and precious metals then,
anticipating hyperinflation will lead to higher interest rates.
Bass also said in May that Europe’s debt crisis will not be
solved by the $1 trillion loan package the International
Monetary Fund and the European Union agreed on earlier that
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
