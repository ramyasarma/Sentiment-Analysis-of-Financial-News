China is unlikely to set its
economic growth target in the nation’s five-year plan for the
period from 2011 through 2015 at more than 8 percent a year, the
China Securities Journal reported today, citing an unidentified
person.  The Chinese economy may grow at about 8.7 percent annually
from 2011 through 2015, the newspaper reported, citing a report
by the National Development and Reform Commission.  China set its economic growth target at 7.5 percent in the
nation’s previous five-year plan covering 2006 through 2010 and
set a 7 percent goal for the period from 2001 through 2005,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
