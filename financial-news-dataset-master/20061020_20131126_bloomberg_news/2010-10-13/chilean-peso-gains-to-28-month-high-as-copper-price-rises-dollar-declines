Chile’s peso fell from a 28-month
high on speculation the central bank may tomorrow announce
an intervention in the currency market.  The peso dropped 0.4 percent to 478.05 per dollar at 1:16
p.m. New York time, from 476.13 yesterday. Earlier it gained to
473.89, the strongest intraday level since May 26, 2008. The
currency has strengthened 6.2 percent this year.  Chile’s central bank policy committee meets tomorrow and
will slow the pace of its monthly interest-rate increases to 25
basis points, from 50 basis points, according to the median
forecasts of 40 economists and 44 traders in two separate
central bank surveys published today. The current interest rate
is 2.5 percent.  “It hit a very big level, and everybody’s concerned there
may be an announcement tomorrow,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky ,
a currency strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford,
Connecticut. “If the central bank doesn’t announce anything
tomorrow, it could come back. Even if they do 25 basis points
instead of 50, we should still go lower.”  The last time the central bank intervened to weaken the
peso, in April 2008, it did so by buying $50 million a day of
U.S. currency. Finance Minister Felipe Larrain ruled out capital
controls in an Oct. 8 interview.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
