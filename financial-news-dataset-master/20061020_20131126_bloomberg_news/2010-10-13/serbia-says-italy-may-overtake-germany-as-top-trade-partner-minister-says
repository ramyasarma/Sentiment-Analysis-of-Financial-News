Italian investments in Serbian
industries, including car production, and agriculture are
expected to help double bilateral trade to more than $6 billion
annual in the next few years, Trade Minister  Slobodan Milosavljevic  said.  Following  Fiat SpA ’s venture into Serbia’s automobile
industry when it took over car-maker Zastava in 2008, “scores
of local and Italian suppliers are taking positions to become
part of the supply chain,” for Fiat production, which is
expected to reach 200,000 units by 2013, Milosavljevic said
today at an Italian-Serbian business forum in Belgrade.  Serbian-Italian trade peaked at $3.3 billion in 2008,
followed by $2.35 billion last year, making Italy Serbia’s
second-biggest trade partner after Germany, whose trade with the
Balkan country stood at $2.82 billion last year.  That is likely to change, Milosavljevic said, “because
Italy is on the path to become our biggest trade partner.”
Italian businesses operating in the Balkan country can offer
their goods and services to Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, with
which Serbia has free-trade agreements, he said.  Serbia isn’t using its potential as a major food producer
in the region, the minister said. “We already have great access
to the Russian market, and with Italy’s support in know-how, we
could achieve far more together,” he said.  Milosavljevic also said that the Italian fashion industry
is eyeing cooperation with Serbian plants, “where labor is not
as cheap as in Bangladesh, but we offer very skilled labor for
high-end products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
