The rate at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros for three months rose to
the highest in more than 14 months today, according to
data from the European Banking Federation.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for such loans
rose for the twelfth straight day to 0.985 percent. That’s the
highest since July 14, 2009 and up from 0.982 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
