Zain Saudi Arabia, a unit of Mobile
Telecommunications Co., Kuwait’s biggest mobile-phone company,
said its third-quarter loss narrowed as it added customers.  The net loss fell to 544 million riyals ($145.1 million)
from 820 million riyals a year-earlier, Zain Saudi Arabia said
in a statement on the  Saudi bourse website  today.  The decline in the net loss was due to “the expansion in
the customer base and the rise in volume of calls and usage of
broadband service,” Chief Executive Officer  Saad al-Barrak  said
in the statement.  The company is continuing to expand its network to cover 93
percent of the inhabited areas of the country this year, helping
“stop the cash outflow required by the inception operations and
the local roaming agreements” al-Barrak added. Zain Saudi plans
to have 10 million subscribers and revenue exceeding 8 billion
riyals by the end of 2011, the company said.  Emirates Telecommunications Corp.,  the biggest
telecommunications company in the Middle East by market value,
also known as Etisalat, on Sept. 30 offered to buy 46 percent of
Mobile Telecommunications, known as Zain, at 1,700 fils a share.  If the deal goes through, Etisalat, based in Abu Dhabi,
would have to sell its stake in Zain Saudi since it already has
a 27.4 percent holding in  Etihad Etisalat Co ., the kingdom’s
second-largest mobile-phone company, known as Mobily.  National Bank of Kuwait  SAK, Kuwait’s biggest lender, is in
talks to help find a buyer for Zain’s 25 percent stake in Zain
Saudi Arabia after it is purchased by Etisalat, a person
familiar with the discussions said on Oct. 4.  Zain Saudi Arabia shares rose 0.6 percent to 8.05 riyals at
11:56 a.m. in Riyadh. Zain shares in Kuwait jumped 2.9 percent
to 1,420 fils.  To contact the reporters on this story:
