Overseas  investors  bought a net  7
billion rupees  ($156.5 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
extending this year’s record inflows to more than 1 trillion
rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Investors purchased 30.9 billion rupees of shares and sold
23.9 billion rupees,  data  from the Securities and Exchange Board
of India show. Funds sold 2.24 billion rupees of bonds, paring
their debt purchases this year to 481.2 billion rupees.  Global funds have been net buyers of stocks for 30 trading
days, matching the longest such run of flows sparked by Finance
Minister  Pranab Mukherjee ’s pledge on Feb. 26 to trim the fiscal
deficit from a 16-year high.  The money has pushed the benchmark  Sensitive index  to the
highest level in more than 2 1/2 years and helped the rupee jump
7.2 percent from an eight-month low in May. Stock purchases this
year include 243 billion rupees from the primary market.  Overseas  investors  have invested 4.14 trillion rupees in
stocks and 803.8 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed
into the country in 1993. The previous record was in 2009 when
flows reached 834.2 billion rupees, sparking the biggest rally
in 18 years. Funds withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from
stocks in 2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
