Emirates Telecom Corp. started talks
with banks to finance the purchase of a stake in Mobile
Telecommunications Co., the Kuwaiti company known as Zain, al-
Bayan said citing Chief Operating Office Salem Al-Sharhan.  The United Arab Emirates-based company known as Etisalat is
considering bank loans, selling bonds in the international
markets or a combination of both, he said, without naming the
lenders the company is in talks with. The company will not need
financing from the government of Abu Dhabi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
