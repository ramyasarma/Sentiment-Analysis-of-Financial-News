OPEC  will agree to keep production
quotas unchanged when it meets tomorrow in Vienna because the
oil market is well-balanced for the next few months, a delegate
said today.  While demand is slowly increasing, commercial stockpiles
remain high for the moment and OPEC should raise supply again
when it becomes clear that demand is overtaking supply, said the
Persian Gulf oil official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries won’t
react hastily to influences on the price of oil caused by a
weakening U.S. dollar, and members should make efforts to comply
more closely with agreed production limits in order to improve
the organization’s credibility, the official said.  Ministers and top oil officials from Kuwait, Libya and
Qatar have said in the past three days that the 12-member group
will probably leave quotas unchanged amid mixed signals on
global economic growth. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ahmad al-
Abdullah al-Sabah said in an interview earlier today that his
country will urge greater compliance with existing output
limits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
