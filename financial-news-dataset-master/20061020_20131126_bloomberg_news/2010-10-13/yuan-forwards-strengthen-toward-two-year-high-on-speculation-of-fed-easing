Yuan forwards rose toward a two-year
high after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September meeting
showed it was prepared to ease monetary policy further, boosting
demand for emerging-market assets.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said China has
let its currency rise in recent weeks at a “pretty significant
rate” and will probably allow it to appreciate more over a
longer period of time. He made the comments in an interview on
the “Charlie Rose” show to air later today on the PBS network
in the U.S. and tomorrow on Bloomberg Television.  “It’s a dollar story more than anything,” said  Thio Chin Loo , a senior currency analyst at BNP Paribas SA in Singapore.
“Even if it’s supposed to be more U.S. pressure, it won’t sway
China from appreciating the yuan at its own pace.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent
to 6.4529 per dollar as of 5:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting
bets the currency will strengthen 3.3 percent from the spot rate
over the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts touched 6.4320 yesterday, the highest since July 2008.  The House of Representatives passed a measure on Sept. 29
that would let American companies seek duties on imports from
China to compensate for the effect of a weak yuan.  The bill may well pass in the U.S. Senate, with Congress
submitting it to President Barack Obama for his signature,
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said today in
Beijing, where he is meeting with government leaders on the
issue.  In the spot market, the yuan gained 0.14 percent to 6.6641
today. Thio said the yuan may rise to 6.65 by year-end and 6.45
by the end of 2011.  China’s  trade surplus  narrowed to $16.88 billion in
September, from $20.03 billion the previous month, the customs
bureau said today.  Exports  increased 25.1 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 34.4 percent growth in August. Imports
climbed 24.1 percent.  The People’s Bank of China set today’s reference rate at
6.6693, the strongest level since a peg to the dollar was
scrapped in July 2005.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  Simon Harvey   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
