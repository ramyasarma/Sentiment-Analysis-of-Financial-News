Canadian new home  prices 
unexpectedly rose in August after a decline the previous month,
government figures showed.  The 0.1 percent advance reversed an identical loss in July,
and was led by a 0.9 percent rise for Hamilton, Ontario,
Statistics Canada said today from Ottawa. From a year earlier,
new home prices increased 2.9 percent in August.  Economists predicted the index would decline 0.1 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey  of nine
responses.  Home sales have been aided by low borrowing costs, with
Canada’s five-year fixed  mortgage rate  at 5.39 percent last
week, close to the 5.25 percent set in April 2009 that was the
lowest in half a century.  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said in a Sept. 30
speech that housing investment is slowing after a temporary
renovation tax credit expired and two provinces applied a sales
tax to some home sales. Other reports this month have shown
declines in building permits in August and housing starts in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
