Stephen Koukoulas , formerly head of
global foreign exchange and fixed income at Toronto-Dominion
Bank in London, has been named Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s  macroeconomic  policy adviser.  Koukoulas, chief Asia-Pacific strategist at TD in Sydney
before heading to London in 2007, returned to Australia this
year to work for the Department of Treasury before he was
recruited to Gillard’s office. Koukoulas, 47, declined to be
interviewed.  Koukoulas begins as Gillard calls for the world’s biggest
coal and iron ore exporter to broaden its economy beyond mining.
She also said yesterday exporters and farmers were being hurt by
a rising currency, which last week reached the highest level
since it began trading freely in 1983.  Economic growth in Australia is expected to pick up from
its current rate of about 3.25 percent to closer to 4 percent
“over the next couple of years,” central bank Deputy Governor
 Ric Battellino  said last week.  Koukoulas, who replaced Andrew Charlton, is part of
Gillard’s team to address what she described yesterday as a
“patchwork economy” where regions exposed to mining are
booming while others stagnate.  Gillard formed a minority government with three
independents and one Greens lawmaker after the Aug. 21 election
delivered the closest result in 70 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
