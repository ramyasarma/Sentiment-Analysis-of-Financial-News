The U.S. government’s failure to
propose a national solution to the mortgage foreclosure crisis
is exacerbating the problem and leading to panic, according to a
law professor who studies home repossessions.  Katherine Porter , a visiting professor at Harvard Law
School who has studied how banks handle the process, urged
national regulators such as the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
and the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to educate
the public and provide national solutions.  “This is a problem that cries out for a national
regulatory response, these problems are systemic,” Porter said
today in a phone interview. “Throwing these out one-by-one
within the court system -- that’s not what the court system was
designed for. It’s not for the mass screw-up.”  Attorneys general from all 50 states said today they’ve
banded together to open an investigation into whether banks and
loan servicers used false documents and signatures to justify
hundreds of thousands of foreclosures, a practice known as
“robo-signing.” Lenders including  Ally Financial Inc. ,  Bank of
America Corp.  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  have suspended some
foreclosures while they review their paperwork.  “There’s no reason that the federal government couldn’t be
stepping in here, but instead we have our usual fall-backs,”
Porter said. “We have the soft touch from the OCC and we have
the state attorneys general trying to do something and that’s
exactly where we were with subprime lending and the origination
problem.”  Mass Modifications  Regulators should be encouraging mass modifications of
loans that have faulty paperwork or at least supervising
servicers to ensure that they’re following proper procedures,
Porter said.  Lenders and servicers are aggravating the crisis by
promising to review their procedures and fix any problems,
without providing any details on actual solutions, she said.  “Our government ought to be asking for a detailed plan
about what the fix is going to be to make sure the fix doesn’t
create another down-the-road legal liability,” Porter said.  “Keep in mind, when they were robo-signing and not
verifying, they were ‘fixing’ a problem,” Porter said. “They
keep fixing them by skirting other rules.”
