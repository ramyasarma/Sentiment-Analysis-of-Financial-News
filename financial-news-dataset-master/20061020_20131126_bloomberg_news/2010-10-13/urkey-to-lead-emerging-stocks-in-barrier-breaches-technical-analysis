Turkey’s main stock  index , the
world’s second-best performer in the past month, may ignore
“overbought” technical indicators and gain another 11 percent
from its current record, leading emerging markets in breaching
technical barriers, according to Auerbach Grayson & Co.  Turkey’s ISE 100 index may reach 73,200 by year-end, after
closing at a record 69,675.08 yesterday, with an “upside” of
77,664, representing a 150 percent  Fibonacci projection  from a
previous peak set in October 2007 to November 2008 low, said
 Richard Ross , a global technical strategist at Auerbach.  The ISE 100’s 14-day  relative strength index  has been above
70 for the past eight days, reaching 85 today, and all but one
day in the last 23, a series unmatched since a 26-day run higher
than 70 ended Aug. 28 last year. The RSI identifies possible
turning points in indexes or securities by measuring the degree
that gains and losses outpace each other in a given time period.
A reading above 70 means the gauge is poised to decline.  “When bulls are in control and buyers impose their will
as they are in Turkey, traditional tools like RSI must be viewed
within the context of the overall technical backdrop, which
remains decidedly bullish,”  Ross , based in New York, wrote in
an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg yesterday.  The ISE, up 12 percent in the past month, bears a similar
“technical signature” to that of other emerging markets, Ross
said. Indonesia’s Jakarta Composite Index has closed at an RSI
above 70 for the past 14 days, Mexico’s  IPC Index  for the past
seven and the MSCI Emerging-Market Index, with an RSI of 77.8
today, for the last 18 days.  Turkish stocks have been propelled to record highs on the
government’s pledge to cut its deficit and economic growth
matching China’s as the fastest among Group of 20 countries in
the second quarter. Ross’s analysis sets aside such fundamental
factors and is based on technical indicators, including
Fibonacci analysis, a system pioneered in the 13th century that
assumes asset prices will follow patterns based on proportions
found in nature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
