Apollo Group Inc. , the biggest
education company by enrollment and operator of the University
of Phoenix, withdrew its forecast for fiscal 2011 citing
regulatory scrutiny and declining numbers of new students. The
shares fell about 12 percent in extended trading.  Apollo expects a drop in new enrollment for its degree
programs to accelerate in the first quarter of 2011, resulting
in “significant year-over-year decline,” the Phoenix-based
company said today in a statement.  Enrollment growth at Apollo slowed as the company faced
competition to sign up more students for its four-year
bachelor’s degree programs, said  Trace Urdan , an analyst with
Signal Hill Capital Group in San Francisco. Apollo also pointed
toward increased regulatory pressure from Washington, where the
Obama administration is preparing new rules governing the
recruitment of students by for-profit colleges.  “This is a spooky characterization, when they’re talking
about significant year-over-year decline in enrollment without
setting a bottom,” said Urdan, who rates the shares “buy” and
doesn’t own them, in a telephone interview.  Apollo fell $6.91, or 12 percent, to $43.37 at 5:12 p.m.
New York time in extended trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market
after closing at $49.50. The shares have  declined  33 percent in
the past 12 months.  Previous Forecast  The company  said  in May it expected “high single-digit
consolidated net revenue growth” in fiscal year 2011 and that
operating income would remain unchanged.  Apollo said today that industry challenges including
“ongoing regulatory and other scrutiny which has led to
heightened media attention” is likely to “adversely impact its
operating metrics and financial results.”  Apollo reported  income  from continuing operations for the
fiscal fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 fell to $47.5 million, or 32
cents a share, from $97.2 million, or 62 cents a share. Revenue
rose 17 percent to $1.26 billion. The company  acquired  BPP
Holdings, the London-based provider of education services and
publications, in July 2009.  Earnings excluding some items of $1.31 beat the $1.30
average estimate of 22 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Apollo has been trying to sign up more four-year,
bachelor’s degree students, who generate more revenue once
they’re enrolled and are less likely to drop out than those in
two-year associate’s degree programs, Urdan said. New bachelor’s
degree enrollments rose to 36,200, from 31,700 in the year-
earlier period.  Enrollment Declines  New enrollment in two-year associate’s degree programs fell
to 42,200 in the quarter, from 55,400 a year earlier, Apollo
said. Total enrollment of new students in programs for a degree
fell to 92,000 from 102,000.  Senator  Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat, is investigating for-
profit college recruitment practices, program quality and use of
government funds. The Education Department plans to publish
rules on or around Nov. 1 that will restore a ban on education
companies’ paying recruiters based on the number of students
signed up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
