The yen could strengthen beyond its
1995 high versus the dollar even while the Japanese government
said it’s prepared to intervene again to curb the currency’s
gains, according to Barclays Plc, citing technical analysis.  The yen has rallied 12 percent this year versus the
greenback, reaching a 15-year high Oct. 11. The Japanese
currency has appreciated beyond 82.88 per dollar, where it
traded on Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged selling the yen to
help its export-dependent economy. The yen is approaching a key
level that may signal further strength, Barclays analysts led by
 Jordan Kotick  in New York wrote in a note to clients.  “A break below 81.35 turns focus on the 1995 low at 79.90,
which despite the risks of intervention, is appearing
increasingly likely to be overcome,” Kotick wrote.  The yen dropped 0.1 percent to 81.81 per dollar as of 10:40
a.m. in New York, from 81.72 yesterday. It reached 81.39 Oct.
11, the lowest level since April 1995.  The Japanese currency’s advances hurt companies’ profits
and confidence, Bank of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  told
parliament today. He said the bank will keep monitoring the
currency market “with great interest.”  Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said yesterday at a press
conference in Tokyo that the government is ready to take
“bold” action on currencies, including intervention.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
