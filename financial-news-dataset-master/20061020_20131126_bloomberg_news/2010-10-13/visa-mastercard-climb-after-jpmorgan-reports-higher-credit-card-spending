Visa Inc . and  MasterCard Inc. , the
world’s biggest payment networks, climbed in New York trading
after  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  reported a 6.6 percent increase in
credit-card spending.  Visa advanced 3.6 percent to $76.94, the highest since
July, at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
MasterCard, based in Purchase, New York, rose 3.9 percent to
$230.89, the highest since May.  Spending on the bank’s credit cards increased to $79.6
billion during the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with
$74.7 billion in the same period a year earlier and $78.1
billion in the second quarter, the company said in a financial
 supplement  accompanying its earnings release today. Total
transactions climbed 16 percent to 5.2 billion at  Chase
Paymentech , JPMorgan’s merchant-acquiring business.  The results at New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
credit-card issuer, “reinforce the view that the upcoming
earnings releases for Visa and MasterCard should continue to be
solid, representing another positive catalyst for the stocks,”
 Adam Frisch , an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to
clients. Visa is based in San Francisco.  American Express Co. , the third-biggest payments network
and the biggest credit-card issuer by purchases, climbed 1.9
percent to $39.26. No. 4 network  Discover Financial Services ,
whose stock has outperformed the three larger competitors this
year, rose 3.5 percent to $17.68, the highest since May 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
