Japan’s 10-year government bond
yields may fall below 0.7 percent for the first time since June
2003 after the central bank eased monetary policy last week,
Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co. said.  Benchmark yields are likely to drop 20 basis points from
today’s rate of 0.86 percent as spreads between longer-dated
bonds narrow toward levels for shorter-dated securities,
flattening the so-called yield curve, according to  Tokuyoshi Takano , a financial-derivatives manager at Mitsui Sumitomo.
Demand for debt increased after the Bank of Japan cut its key
interest rate to a range of zero to 0.1 percent on Oct. 5.  “The yield curve is steepening for longer tenors, with the
spread between  seven and 10 years  standing at almost 50 basis
points, compared with less than 20 basis points between  five and
seven years ,” Takano said in Tokyo. “The seven- to 10-year
curve may flatten like the five- to seven-year portion.”  The  Bank of Japan  at last week’s policy meeting also
created a 5 trillion yen ($61 billion) fund to buy bonds and
other assets, and pledged to keep its benchmark interest rate at
“virtually zero” until the end of deflation is in sight.  Downside risks for the Japanese and U.S. economy will
increase in the three months through December 31 as the yen
strengthens toward a new 15-year high, Takano said. That may
prompt the Bank of Japan to expand monetary easing measures,
sending 10-year bond yields further below 0.7 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
