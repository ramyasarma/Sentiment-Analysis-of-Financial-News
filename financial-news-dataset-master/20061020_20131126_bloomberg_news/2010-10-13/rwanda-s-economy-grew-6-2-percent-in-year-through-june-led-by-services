Rwanda’s  economy  expanded 6.2
percent in the fiscal year through June, led by services, the
National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda said.  Growth slowed from 9.8 percent the year before, the
institute said on its website yesterday.  In the last quarter of the fiscal year, annual growth
accelerated to 9.4 percent from 7.4 percent in the previous
three months, according to the website. That was the fastest
pace since the three months through March 2009.  Growth in the fiscal year was led by services, which
expanded 8 percent, followed by agriculture with growth of 6
percent and industry at 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
