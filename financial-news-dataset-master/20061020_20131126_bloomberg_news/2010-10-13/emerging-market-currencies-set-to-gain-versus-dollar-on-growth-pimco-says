Emerging-market currencies are
likely to rise against the U.S. dollar as consumer demand in
those nations is taking over from U.S. household spending as a
major driver of world economic growth, according to Pacific
Investment Management Co.  Investors seeking to benefit from economic growth in
developing markets may want to look at investing in local-
currency government bonds, Curtis Mewbourne, a managing director
at Newport Beach, California-based Pimco, said on the firm’s
website. Dollar-denominated bonds issued by emerging-market
corporations also may be attractive, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
