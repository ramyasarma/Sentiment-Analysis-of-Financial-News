Former German President Horst
Koehler will join a commission advising the Group of 20 nations,
the newspaper Die Zeit said, citing unnamed banking sources.  Koehler, a former managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, resigned as Germany’s mainly ceremonial head of
state on May 31. He cited public criticism over remarks he made
about Germany’s military mission in Afghanistan as his reason
for standing down.  Die Zeit said that the French government plans to set up
the G-20 commission.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
