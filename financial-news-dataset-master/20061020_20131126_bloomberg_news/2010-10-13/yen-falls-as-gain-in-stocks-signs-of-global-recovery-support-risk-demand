The yen fell against most of its
major counterparts as signs the global economic recovery is
gathering momentum and a boost in corporate earnings spurred
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The dollar fell to a record low against the Swiss franc as
traders speculated the Federal Reserve will debase its currency
by increasing purchases of government debt. Australia’s dollar
climbed to its highest level versus the greenback since it began
trading freely in 1983 and Canada’s currency approached parity
as commodities gained.  “Equities are better bid, and that’s always correlated to
strong commodity currencies,” said  Lane Newman , director of
foreign exchange at ING Groep NV in New York. “If the yen
weakens, that’s just a function of their buying other
currencies.”  The yen declined for the first time in five days versus the
euro, depreciating 0.2 percent to 114.06 at 4:06 p.m. in New
York, from 113.79 yesterday. Japan’s currency traded at 81.73
per dollar, compared with 81.72. It touched 81.39 on Oct. 11,
the strongest level since April 1995. The euro gained 0.2
percent to $1.3956, from $1.3924, after touching $1.4001. It
reached $1.4029 on Oct. 7, the highest level since Jan. 28.  The 16-nation euro pared gains after rising above $1.40,
where orders to sell are clustered, according to  Andrew Busch , a
global currency strategist at Bank of Montreal in Chicago, who
said the currency “has a problem” at that level. The euro will
trade in a narrow range versus the dollar until the Fed’s Nov.
2-3 meeting, he said.  European Output  The euro approached earlier today its strongest level
against the dollar since January as Europe’s  industrial
production  rose 1 percent in August after a revised 0.1 percent
increase in the prior month.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rallied 0.7 percent,
closing at a five-month high as CSX Corp. reported better-than-
estimated results. Crude oil for November delivery rose 1.6
percent to $82.96 a barrel.  Australia’s dollar climbed 0.4 percent to 99.02 U.S. cents
after touching a record high of 99.37. A  consumer sentiment
index , based on a Westpac Banking Corp. and Melbourne Institute
survey of 1,200 consumers, rose 3.3 percent to 117 this month,
after a 5 percent drop in September.  Canada’s currency appreciated 0.6 percent to C$1.0046 per
U.S. dollar after reaching C$1.0011, the strongest level since
April 27. The loonie approached parity as the government
reported that new home prices rose 0.1 percent in August after a
0.1 percent decline in the previous month.  Asian Currencies  Asian currencies strengthened on speculation an increase in
Fed debt buying, also known as quantitative easing, will pump
more cash into the U.S. economy and also boost the inflow of
funds into emerging-market assets.  South Korea’s won was the best performer versus the dollar
among the greenback’s Asian counterparts, appreciating 1 percent
to 1,120.70. It touched 1,110.75 on Oct. 11, the strongest level
since May 3.  Thailand’s baht gained 0.4 percent to 29.85 per dollar
after advancing to the 13-year high of 29.80 even as the
government said yesterday it will remove a 15 percent tax
exemption on overseas investors’ income from domestic bonds.  The Dollar Index, used by  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.  to
track the greenback against currencies including the euro, yen
and Swiss franc, slid as much as 0.5 percent to 76.972. The
franc gained as much as 0.2 percent to a record 95.45 centimes
per dollar before trading at 95.85.  Weaker Dollar  ICE’s gauge of the dollar has fallen 4.1 percent since
Sept. 21, when the Fed said in a statement following its policy
meeting that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation
if needed” to support the recovery.  Yuan forwards were near a two-year high today on
speculation China will allow greater gains and the Fed will
inject more stimulus.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent
to 6.4529 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency will
strengthen 3.3 percent from the spot rate over the next year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s foreign-exchange reserves, the world’s largest,
surged by a record to $2.65 trillion at the end of September,
adding fuel to complaints that the nation’s curbs on gains in
the yuan are undermining the global recovery.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said in an
interview on “ Charlie Rose ” airing on PBS yesterday and
scheduled to be broadcast on Bloomberg Television today that
China’s policy of buying dollars to hold down the yuan is
distorting the global currency system by forcing other emerging-
market nations to intervene.  Bank of Japan  The yen dropped earlier against the euro and dollar as Bank
of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  said in Parliament that he
may examine enhancing a 5 trillion yen ($61 billion) fund to buy
government debt.  Advances in Japan’s currency hurt companies’ profits and
confidence, according to Shirakawa, who said the bank will keep
monitoring the currency market “with great interest.”  The yen stayed stronger than 82.88 per dollar, where it
traded on Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged selling the currency
to help its export-dependent economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
