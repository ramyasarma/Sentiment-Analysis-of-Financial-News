European Union commissioners Olli Rehn and  Michel Barnier  said they are confident in Greece’s
efforts to tackle its debt in the wake of its downgrade by
Moody’s Investors Service.  Rehn, the EU’s economic and monetary affairs commissioner,
and Barnier, who is in charge of financial-services policy in
the region, said they are “confident in the actions the Greek
government is carrying out.” Planned EU rules to regulate
credit-rating companies “will be fundamental and tackle the
problems we know exist,” the commissioners said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Proposals on rating-firm regulation are “due before the
end of the summer,” they said in the statement. “The last few
days highlight, once again, how important a more and better
regulated environment for ratings is.”  Moodys downgraded  Greece ’s government bond ratings to B1
from Ba1, and assigned a negative outlook to the rating, on
March 7. The ratings firm today cut  Spain ’s credit rating to
Aa2, citing its concerns that the cost of shoring the banking
industry will eclipse government estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
