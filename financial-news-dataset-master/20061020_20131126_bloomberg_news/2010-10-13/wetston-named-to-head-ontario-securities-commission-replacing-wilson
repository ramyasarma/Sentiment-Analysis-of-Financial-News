Ontario Energy Board Chief Executive
Officer  Howard Wetston  was appointed chairman and CEO of the
Ontario Securities Commission, Canada’s largest provincial
securities regulator.  Ontario Finance Minister  Dwight Duncan  named Wetston to
succeed  David Wilson , 65, whose five-year term ends Oct. 31,
according to a  statement  today from the Ontario government. The
appointment is subject to review by the Standing Committee on
Government Agencies.  Wetston, a former vice chairman of the Ontario Securities
Commission, has been chairman and CEO of the Ontario Energy
Board since 2003. Before then, he was a judge at the Federal
Court of Canada.  The federal government plans to create a national
securities regulator by 2012 to combine the provincial agencies
that oversee capital markets in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
