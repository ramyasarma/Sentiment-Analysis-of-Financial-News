The Swiss franc weakened against the
euro, snapping three days of gains, after European Central Bank
Council member  Axel Weber  said the ECB should stop its bond-
purchase program, damping demand for the currency as a haven.  Weber, who also heads Germany’s Bundesbank, said “these
securities purchases should now be phased out permanently,” in
a  speech  delivered in New York yesterday. The franc earlier
strengthened to a record against the dollar before retreating
after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting indicated
policy makers were ready to pump more cash into the economy.  “Weber’s comments have given the euro support against the
Swiss franc -- he’s a noted hawk, but even on the hawk-o-meter
he was somewhat off the scale,” said  Steve Barrow , London-based
head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange research at Standard Bank.  The Swiss currency weakened 0.5 percent to 1.3375 per euro
as of 8:46 a.m. in London, its largest intraday decline in
almost a week. It was little changed against the dollar at 95.71
centimes, after earlier strengthening to a record of 95.45
centimes.  Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on
Sept. 21, released late yesterday, said the U.S. central bank’s
policy makers were prepared to ease monetary policy “before
long.” Fed staff economists also lowered their U.S. growth
forecast for the third consecutive meeting.  The franc has climbed 5.3 percent this year against a
basket of currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
