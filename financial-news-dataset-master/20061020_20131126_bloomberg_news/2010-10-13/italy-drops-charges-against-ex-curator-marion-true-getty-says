Italy has dropped charges of
conspiracy and handling looted artifacts against  Marion True ,
former antiquities curator at the J.  Paul Getty  Museum in Los
Angeles, according to a Getty spokeswoman.  “It’s our understanding charges have been dropped,” the
Getty spokeswoman, who declined to be named, said. “We are
pleased that charges against  Marion True  have been dismissed,
and we wish her the very best as this long and difficult ordeal
is coming to a close.”  The news was greeted with enthusiasm in some quarters of
the collecting community.  “It was a politically motivated trial just to send the
message: Don’t deal with Italian cultural patrimony or we’ll
create a headache for you,” said Torkom Demirjian, president
and founder of Ariadne Galleries in New York, which specializes
in antiquities. “This whole thing is a bureaucratic and
ideological overreach. It’s a political decision to discourage
private collecting of antiquities.”  The Getty Museum in August 2007 agreed to return 40 objects
to the Italian government, leading Italy to drop civil suits
against True. True still faced criminal charges.  The statute of limitations ran out on those charges, and a
Rome judge agreed with True’s defense team that the trial should
no longer proceed, according to an earlier Associated Press
report.  True has denied the charges against her. She had been on
trial in Rome for the last five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
