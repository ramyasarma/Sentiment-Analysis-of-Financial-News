Cash premiums for corn shipped to
export terminals near New Orleans this month rose relative to
Chicago futures as farmers withheld offers on speculation that
shrinking inventories will boost prices. Soybean premiums fell.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
October rose to 51 cents to 54 cents a bushel above December
futures, compared with 51 cents to 52 cents yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  show. Soybean premiums declined
to 53 cents to 56 cents above November futures from 55 cents to
60 cents.  “Farmers are putting corn in storage, and the trade is
anticipating increased export demand,” said  Bryce Stremming , a
commodity risk consultant at Mid-Co Commodities Inc. in
Bloomington, Illinois. “Farmers are delivering more soybeans.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 9.75 cents, or 1.7
percent, to close at $5.6925 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest drop since Oct. 1. Earlier, the price reached
$5.88, the highest level since August 2008.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $11.765 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached
$11.945, the highest level since June 5, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
