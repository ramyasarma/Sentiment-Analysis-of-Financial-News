The Federal Reserve may resume its
quantitative-easing program in November by targeting half a
trillion dollars in asset purchases, BNP Paribas SA said.  “We expect the Fed to initiate the long-term asset
purchases and announce an initial purchase amount of $500
billion in long-term securities, with a commitment to hold that
portfolio for an extended period and a bias to adjust those
purchases upward,”  Yelena Shulyatyeva , an economist in New
York, wrote in a research report today.  The Fed bought $300 billion of Treasuries as part of its
first round of debt purchases, which began last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
