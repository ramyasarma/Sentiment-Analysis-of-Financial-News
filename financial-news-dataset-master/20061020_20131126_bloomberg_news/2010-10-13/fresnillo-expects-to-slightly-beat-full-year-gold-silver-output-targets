Fresnillo Plc, the world’s largest
primary silver producer, expects to “slightly beat” its full-
year output forecasts for gold and silver.  Fresnillo also sees nothing in the “short term” to cause
a decline in silver prices, the company’s Head of Investor
Relations Arturo Espinola said today on a conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
