A painting by Irma Stern fetched a
record 13.4 million rand ($1.95 million) at an auction in Cape
Town this week, Business Day reported, citing auctioneer Stephan
Welz.  The work, Gladioli, sold for more than its upper estimate
of 7 million rand and was bought by Louis Schachat of the
Kunskamer art gallery on behalf of a client, the Johannesburg-
based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
