Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA 
fell the most in two months after the world’s fourth-largest
aircraft maker said it delivered 44 jets, less than estimates by
some analysts.  Embraer, as the company is known, dropped 4.2 percent to
11.56 reais, the biggest decline since Aug. 11. The drop
contrasts with a 1 percent advance for the Bovespa stock index.  The Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil-based company said it had a
backlog totaling $15.3 billion in the three months through
September, according to an e-mailed statement.  “The deliveries were weak,” said  Felipe Rocha , a
transportation analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage Link
Corretora. “Although it’s possible they will come in next
quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
