U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F.
Geithner said China has in recent weeks let its currency rise at
a “pretty significant rate” and will probably allow it to
appreciate more over a longer period of time.  Chinese officials “started to let their currency
appreciate at a pretty significant rate. It’s only been now in
the last six weeks or so, about 2-2.5 percent,” Geithner said
in an interview on “Charlie Rose,” to air later today on PBS
and tomorrow on Bloomberg Television, according to a transcript.
“But this is going to be a gradual process, and what matters to
us is that they continue to let their currency rise to reflect
those market forces.”  He also said emerging market economies such as China, India
and Brazil are growing “very rapidly,” while expansions in
Europe and Japan are “much weaker,” and the U.S. economic
outlook “mixed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
