Collins Stewart Plc  said Deputy
Chairman  Terry Smith  will retire as a director of Britain’s
biggest stockbroker on Dec. 6 to focus on a new fund management
venture.  Smith will develop a new asset management company called
Fundsmith, the London-based broker said today in a statement. He
remains chief executive officer of  Tullett Prebon Plc , an
interdealer broker that split from Collins Stewart in 2006.  “All good things must come to an end and I will now focus
on Tullett Prebon and new challenges, in particular my new fund
management venture Fundsmith,” Smith said in the statement.  Smith oversaw Collins Stewart’s growth to become the U.K.’s
biggest stockbroker as CEO between 1996 and 2003 and as chairman
between 2006 and April this year. The company sold shares to the
public in 2000.  Smith may put 20 million pounds ($32 million) of his 60-
million-pound fortune into Fundsmith, which will allow outsiders
to invest alongside him for the first time, the Sunday Telegraph
reported on Sept. 12.  Collins Stewart in July posted a 1.8 percent drop in first-
half profit to 5.4 million pounds amid “difficult markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
