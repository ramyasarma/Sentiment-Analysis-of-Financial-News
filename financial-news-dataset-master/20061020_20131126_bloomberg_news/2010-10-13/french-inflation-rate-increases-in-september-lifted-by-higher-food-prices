France’s inflation rate rose in
September as the price of agricultural products increased around
the world.  Consumer prices based on European Union methodology 1.8
percent from a year earlier, compared with a 1.6 percent
increase in August, the Paris-based national statistics office
 Insee  said today. The increase matched the 1.8 percent median
forecasts of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg survey.  Food costs are set to contribute to faster inflation in the
months ahead, though prices for agricultural commodities are
rising more quickly than those for processed food, economists
said. Global food prices climbed to a two-year high in September
as costs for grain and sugar surged, according to the United
Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization.  “Food prices are likely to remain an upside risk in the
short term,” Fabio Fois, an economist at Barclays Capital in
London, said in a note to clients yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
