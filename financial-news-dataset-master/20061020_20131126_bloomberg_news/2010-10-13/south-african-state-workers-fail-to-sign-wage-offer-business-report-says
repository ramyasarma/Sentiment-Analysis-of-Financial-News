South African civil-servant labor
unions failed to sign a wage deal by the deadline yesterday
because a majority didn’t support the offer, Business Report
said, citing Chris Klopper, chairman of the Independent Labour
Caucus.  The 19 labor unions will meet today to decide on what
further steps to take, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
