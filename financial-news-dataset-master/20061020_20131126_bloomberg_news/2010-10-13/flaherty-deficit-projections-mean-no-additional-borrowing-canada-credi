Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty ’s
announcement that Canada will be the first in the Group of Seven
to erase its deficit and do so with “prudent” economic growth
assumptions, will cap government borrowing needs over the next
five years, analysts said.  Flaherty said yesterday Canada’s cumulative deficits over
the next five years will be C$165.2 billion ($163.6 billion),
compared with a C$158.4 billion projection in his March budget.
Because the budget used economic growth forecasts that are below
consensus, the government has left itself room to beat its new
target.  Canadian government bonds are on pace to return 9.7 percent
this year, which would make it the second best year since 2001,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. Flaherty may
have less difficulty closing the budget gap than his peers in
other G-7 countries, even after the economy slowed to a 2
percent  annual growth pace  in the April-June period, from 5.8
percent in the first quarter.  “It’s very supportive for Canadian bonds, particularly
given the stability of the Canadian economy and certainly the
predictability that we’ve seen as compared to the rest of the G-
7,” said  Ric Palombi , a fixed-income portfolio manager in
Calgary at McLean & Partners, which oversees more than C$1
billion.  The update showed Canada’s federal-debt-gross domestic
product ratio will be 30.8 percent 2016, from the 34 percent
2010 level, making it the least indebted G-7 country.  ‘Pretty Good Shape’  “Being more conservative is generally viewed as a good
thing, particularly by bondholders,” said  Marc Rouleau , a fund
manager at Standard Life Investments in Montreal who helps
manage C$18 billion in fixed-income assets. “I don’t think
people will view this as a very bad news story; I think they
will view this as an honest story in a difficult climate.”  Canadian bond yields over the next few months will depend
largely on whether and how the U.S. Federal Reserve implements
another round of quantitative easing, Palombi said.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the yield on Canada’s  10-year
bond  rebounded after touching the lowest since January 2009 on
Oct. 11. The yield on the 3.5 percent security maturing in June
2020 rose four basis points to 2.73 percent as the price fell 35
cents to C$106.53. A basis point equals 0.01 percentage point.  Canada sold C$8.6 billion of T-Bills maturing Jan. 20 at a
yield of 0.894 percent, bringing the total for that issue to
C$14 billion. It also sold C$3.2 billion of bills due March 31
at a 1.011 percent yield, increasing the total for that security
to C$6.1 billion, and another C$3.2 billion of bills due Sept.
29 at a yield of 1.202 percent, bringing that issue to C$6.1
billion.  Corporate Spreads  The government also said it will sell C$2.4 billion of one-
year and six-month treasuries and C$6.45 billion of three-month
T-bills later this month.  Flaherty’s budget update revised the 2010 growth forecast
to 3 percent from 2.6 percent in the March 4 budget. The
International Monetary Fund last week pegged 2010 growth at 3.1
percent. Flaherty also said growth will be 2.5 percent next
year, 2.8 percent in 2012 and 2.9 percent in 2013.  The decision by Flaherty to cut economists’ estimates for
nominal GDP by 0.5 percentage point “leaves room for downside
surprises,”  Warren Lovely , a government debt strategist at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto, said in a note to
clients.  ‘Prudent Assumptions’  “The economic assumptions are reasonable,” said  Mark Chandler , head of Canadian fixed-income and currency strategy at
Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, “We expect something a little
stronger, but understand that the prudent assumptions that they
use are sometimes lower.”  Chandler said he expects borrowing plans to be little
changed, coming in at C$3 billion to C$4 billion less than the
C$90 billion he projected for this year. Chandler said he sees
“very marginal” changes in future years.  The government estimated in  its budget  that a 1 percentage
point drop in growth would reduce its budget balance by C$10.9
billion over a three-year period.  For the April-July period, the deficit narrowed to C$7.7
billion from C$18.3 billion a year ago, the government said
Sept. 24.  “There is going to be a little bit of international
recognition that we are in pretty good shape,” said  Malcolm J. Jones , a portfolio manager at Adroit Investment Management Ltd.
in Edmonton, Alberta, who oversees about C$350 million of fixed-
income securities. “If it goes on this path it’s great,” he
said, “but I actually want to see it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
