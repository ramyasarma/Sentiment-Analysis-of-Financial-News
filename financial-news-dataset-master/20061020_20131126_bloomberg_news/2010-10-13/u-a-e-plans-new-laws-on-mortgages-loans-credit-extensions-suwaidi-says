The United Arab Emirates plans
regulations to contain credit growth after Dubai’s real estate
market boomed and then slumped, Central Bank Governor  Sultan bin Nasser al-Suwaidi  said.  “Mortgage loan regulations are coming,” al-Suwaidi told a
conference today in Dubai. “The U.A.E. should have regulations
to restrict credit growth when it reaches a certain level.”  Bank lending soared in the U.A.E. after Dubai, the second-
largest emirate, opened its real estate market to foreigners in
2002, leading to a quadrupling of real estate prices. The global
financial crisis caused a wave of defaults that forced U.A.E.
banks to increase provisions for bad loans by 41 percent in the
12 months through August.  Dubai World, one of the emirate’s three main state-owned
holding companies, said on Sept. 10 that creditors holding more
than 99 percent of the value of its loans approved a plan to
alter the terms on $24.9 billion of debt.  Al-Suwaidi predicted economic growth of between 3 and 4
percent next year, compared with a government forecast of 3.2
percent for 2010. He said it will “take a while” for interbank
lending rates in the U.A.E. to fall into line with international
levels. The three-month rate dropped to 2.1875 percent
yesterday, the lowest since February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
