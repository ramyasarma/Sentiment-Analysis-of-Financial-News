Namibia plans to spend 3 billion
Namibian dollars ($438.2 million) over the next three years
expanding capacity at the Walvis Bay port, Business Report said,
citing Johny Smith, chief executive officer of the Walvis Bay
Corridor Group.  The project aims to increase container capacity to 500,000
twenty-foot equivalent units from 200,000 units, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said. The depth of the port will
also be increased to 16 meters (52 feet) from 12 meters, it
said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
