Raytheon Co. , the world’s biggest
missile maker, plans to sell debt in a three-part benchmark
offering as soon as today, according to a person familiar with
the transaction.  The company will issue 5-, 10- and 30-year securities to
buy back 5.5 percent debt due November 2012 and 5.375 percent
notes maturing in April 2013, Raytheon said today in a
regulatory filing that didn’t specify the size or timing of the
offering. Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million.  Raytheon, based in Waltham, Massachusetts, is marketing
debt for the first time since November 2009, when it sold $500
million of 4.4 percent notes due in February 2020, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The defense contractor has $2.33
billion of long-term debt and $2.39 billion in cash and near-
cash assets, according to its most recent quarterly filing.  The new notes may be rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors
Service and A- by Standard & Poor’s, said the person, who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.  Raytheon issued $350 million of the 5.5 percent notes in
November 2002, and $425 million of the 5.375 percent debt in
March 2003, Bloomberg data show. About $333 million of the 2012
debt is outstanding, and $345 million of the 2013 notes,
according to today’s filing.  Raytheon’s 4.4 percent notes maturing in February 2020
traded on Oct. 5 at 111.34 cents on the dollar to yield 3
percent, or 52.7 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Remaining proceeds from the debt sale after redeeming the
outstanding notes may be used for working capital, capital
expenditures, repaying outstanding debt, share buybacks, pension
contributions and acquisitions, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
