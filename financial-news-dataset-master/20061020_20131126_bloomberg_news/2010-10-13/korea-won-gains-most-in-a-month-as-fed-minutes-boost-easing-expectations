South Korea’s won climbed the most
in more than a month after the U.S. Federal Reserve vowed to
take measures to stabilize the world’s biggest economy, boosting
the appeal of higher-yielding currencies.  Policy makers at the Fed were prepared to ease monetary
policy “before long,” according to the minutes of a Sept. 21
meeting released yesterday. The benchmark  Kospi  index snapped a
four-day drop as overseas investors bought more domestic shares
than they sold.  “We definitely see heightened expectations of quantitative
easing in the U.S. market now,” said  Ko Yun Jin , a Seoul-based
currency dealer at Kookmin Bank. “That will push forward the
trend of a weaker U.S. dollar and subsequently strengthen Asian
currencies.”  The won rose 1.1 percent to 1,119.45 per dollar as of 9:55
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency advanced as much as 1.2 percent, the most since Sept.
1.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  said in a research report
yesterday that the Fed will announce Treasury purchases of about
$500 billion at a policy meeting next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
