South Africa’s rand strengthened for
the first time in three days and bonds rose the most in three
weeks on speculation the Federal Reserve will ease monetary
policy further, boosting the appeal of higher-yielding assets.  The rand appreciated as much as 1.1 percent to 6.8174 per
dollar and traded 0.8 percent stronger at 6.8355 by 4:31 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a previous close of 6.8894. The benchmark
13.5 percent security due September 2015 advanced for a third
day, adding 39 cents to 125.83 rand, the steepest increase since
Sept. 22. The yield fell nine basis points to 7.17 percent.  Fed policy makers last month were prepared to ease monetary
policy “before long,” purchase more Treasury securities and
boost inflation expectations to stimulate the economy, according
to Sept. 21 minutes released yesterday in Washington. Weaker-
than-forecast U.S. job growth in September, has increased
speculation that the nation’s central bank will soon start a
second wave of unconventional monetary easing.  “The Fed is contemplating further quantitative easing even
at a time when there is no financial market crisis,”  Ulrich Leuchtmann , the Frankfurt-based head of currency strategy at
Commerzbank AG, Germany’s second-biggest lender, said in a
telephone interview. “We see the virtually zero interest rates
in the U.S. remaining for longer. That makes high-yield
currencies like the rand so much more attractive.”  A sluggish recovery from the U.S.’s worst recession since
the 1930s may prompt the Fed to step up purchases of government
debt, a process known as quantitative easing, while at the same
time keeping interest rates at near-zero levels.  Carry Trades  Benchmark rates of 0.1 percent in Japan and 0.25 percent in
the U.S. have encouraged investors to borrow cheaply and invest
in markets offering higher returns, a strategy known as the
carry trade which has prompted a 38 percent rally in the rand
since the start 2009. South Africa’s benchmark interest rate is
6 percent.  The rand gained even after a report showed the country’s
retail sales growth slowed to an annual 4.6 percent in August,
almost half the pace of the previous month. Sales growth eased
from a revised 8 percent in July, Pretoria-based Statistics
South Africa said on its website today.  Against the euro the rand appreciated 0.2 percent to
9.5314, from 9.5538 yesterday. The rand appreciated 0.4 percent
against the pound to 10.8311, from a previous close of 10.8792.  To contact the reporter on this story:
