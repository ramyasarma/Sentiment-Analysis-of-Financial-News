Dubai Electricity & Water Authority,
the government-run utility, plans to sell $2 billion of senior
unsecured U.S. dollar-denominated debt in a two-part offering,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The notes may be issued as soon as tomorrow, said the
person, who declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.  A portion of the debt maturing in 6 years may yield about
6.5 percent to 6.625 percent, and 10-year notes may yield about
7.5 percent to 7.625 percent, the person said.  The debt may be rated Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Service, two
levels below investment grade, the person said.  Citigroup Inc., Credit Agricole SA, National Bank of Abu
Dhabi PJSC, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Standard
Chartered Plc are managing the sale, the person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
