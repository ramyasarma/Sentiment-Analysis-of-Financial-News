Italy should be able to hand control
of the northwestern Afghan region of Herat to local security
forces before 2012, Defense Minister  Ignazio La Russa  said.  “We hope that by the end of 2011 our responsibility will
be limited to training” local forces, La Russa said in a speech
to the upper house of parliament in Rome. “This won’t mean the
end of our military mission” in Afghanistan.  Four Italian soldiers were killed and one was seriously
injured on Oct. 9 after a bomb explosion ripped through their
vehicle near Farah in western Afghanistan. Italy has almost
4,000 non-combat soldiers in NATO’s Afghan mission, La Russa
said today.  He called on parliament to back a proposal to equip Italian
Tornado fighter jets in Afghanistan “with bombing capability to
improve the safety of our soldiers on the ground.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
