China’s plans to lay twice as much
high-speed track as the rest of the world combined is turning
2010 into a record year for yuan bond sales.  The rail ministry will issue 20 billion yuan ($3 billion)
in 10- and 15-year notes today, pushing non-sovereign sales to
312 billion yuan this year, up from 307 billion yuan in the same
period of 2009 and the most since Bloomberg began compiling the
data in 1999. The ministry’s new bonds due in October 2025 were
priced to yield 4.1 percent, or 90 basis points less than
similar-maturity debt sold in September 2009, the data show.  Government restrictions on bank loans to cool inflation in
an economy growing four times faster than the U.S. are
increasing the funds banks have available to buy bonds, driving
down costs for financing projects. China is spending about $300
billion to build a high-speed network of at least 18,000
kilometers (11,185 miles) by 2020. By contrast, President  Barack Obama ’s $50 billion program to repair “crumbling” U.S.
transport networks awaits Congressional approval.  “An up-and-coming China investing in greenfield projects
related to its economic build-out starkly contrasts with a
mature U.S. economy where infrastructure spending has been
neglected,”  Tim Condon , the Singapore-based head of Asia
research for ING Groep NV, said in an interview yesterday. “The
railway sector is a particularly stunning example of this
contrast.”  Competitive Disadvantage  High-speed track will connect all of China’s provincial
capitals and cities of at least 500,000 people by 2020, the
Beijing-based Ministry of Railways said in 2008. “Crumbling”
roads, bridges, airports and rail lines are hindering growth,
while other nations are “playing to win tomorrow,” Obama said
on Oct. 11, a week after New Jersey’s governor canceled work on
a commuter-rail tunnel link to New York, citing cost overruns.  “The stimulus that was pushed out starting at the end of
2008 was very important for railway investments as it gave the
go-ahead for a backlog of major infrastructure projects,”  Jinny Yan , a Shanghai-based economist at Standard Chartered Plc, said
in an Oct. 12 interview. “The question now is who is paying for
these railway lines?”  The rail ministry raised 160 billion yuan from bonds this
year, while China Railway Group Ltd. raised 7.7 billion yuan,
China Rail Construction Corp. raised 5 billion yuan and Taiyuan
Hi-Speed Railway Investment Co. got 2 billion yuan from its
first note sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on China Rail Construction’s 10 billion yuan in
3.4 percent bonds due in August 2012 fell this year to 3.23
percent from 3.784 percent, according to Chinabond prices on
Bloomberg.  Golden Spike  Union Pacific and Central Pacific built the first
transcontinental railroad in the U.S., which was completed with
a golden spike in 1869. Union Pacific Corp.’s $400 million of
6.125 percent bonds due in 2020 yield 3.5 percent, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the railroad bought by
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in February, has sold $1.5 billion of
bonds this year. Burlington’s $200 million of 3.6 percent notes
due in 2020 currently yield 3.165 percent, according to Trace.  The China ministry’s 10-year notes were priced to yield 4
percent, or 70 basis points below similar-maturity securities
sold last year. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. A press
officer at the ministry said officials weren’t immediately
available for comment.  Spreads Narrow  The yield on the 3.28 percent government bond due in August
2020 fell 21 basis points in the same period to 3.39 percent,
Interbank Funding Center data showed. The Finance Ministry sold
28 billion yuan of seven-year notes yesterday at an average
yield of 3.1 percent, in line with the average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. The sale drew bids for 1.66 times the amount
on offer.  The  difference  in yield between China’s top-rated 10-year
corporate bonds and similar-maturity government notes has fallen
to 94 basis points, down from 166 basis points a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg and Chinabond data.  Banks are investing their deposits in the bond market after
the central bank set a goal of capping new bank loans in March
at 7.5 trillion yuan this year. Lenders advanced 6.3 trillion
yuan in the first nine months, while adding 10.3 trillion yuan
of deposits, according to the central bank.  The International Monetary Fund forecast last week that
China’s gross domestic product will climb 10.5 percent this year,
outpacing expansion of 2.6 percent in the U.S.  Trade Surplus  Money is flooding into the economy as the trade surplus
widens and investors bet on appreciation in the nation’s
currency. Foreign-exchange reserves rose to a record $2.65
trillion on Sept. 30, the central bank reported yesterday.
 Exports  climbed 25.1 percent last month from a year earlier,
leading to a trade surplus of $16.9 billion, according to the
customs bureau.  Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards advanced 3.4
percent in the past month to 6.4360 per dollar in Hong Kong,
reflecting bets for a gain of 3.4 percent from the onshore spot
rate. The currency strengthened 0.1 percent to 6.6565 as of
11:25 a.m. in Shanghai.  China government bond risk is falling, according to credit-
default swaps. Five-year  contracts  on the nation’s debt declined
29 percent in the past month, the biggest drop among more than
80 nations, and ended yesterday at 52 basis points, according to
data compiled by CMA and Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or
the cash equivalent should a government or company fail to
adhere to debt agreements.  Bonds Rally  China’s $1 billion of 4.75 percent bonds due October 2013
rallied in the past month, sending the yield down 38 basis
points to 1.37 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The  extra yield  investors require to hold China’s
debt instead of Treasuries was 80 basis points yesterday,
according to JPMorgan’s EMBI Global Index.  California Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  rode on bullet
trains in Asia last month as the rail ministry said China can
offer a “complete package” to compete for a $40 billion high-
speed project linking Los Angeles to San Francisco. The state
with the worst credit rating in the U.S. approved a $10 billion
bond sale in 2008 to help pay for the line, which is scheduled
to start services in 2020.  “China has never been in such a rural construction boom,
and the railway sector has been grossly neglected, but it has
become a high priority again,”  Tao Dong , the chief regional
economist for Credit Suisse Group AG, said in an Oct. 12 phone
interview from Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
