Mexico’s peso gained for a second
day after a report showed  industrial production  rose more than
forecast, signaling the economic recovery won’t stall.  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 12.3849 per dollar at 8:56
a.m. New York time, from 12.4047 yesterday. The currency has
risen 5.6 percent this year against the dollar.  “We had some good economic data out of Mexico yesterday,”
said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , an emerging markets strategist at
RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut. “The economic
story there remains mixed, but not worse.”  Industrial production rose 8.1 percent in August, above a
median estimate for an increase of 6.3 percent in a Bloomberg
survey, the national statistics agency said yesterday.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.3 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. Yesterday, the yield reached
the lowest level since the security was issued in 2005. The
price fell 0.49 centavo to 134.59 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
