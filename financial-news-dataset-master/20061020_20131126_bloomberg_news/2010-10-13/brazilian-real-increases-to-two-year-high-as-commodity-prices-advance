Brazil’s real reached a two-year
high as commodities prices gained.  The real advanced 0.5 percent to 1.6615 per dollar at 9:15
a.m. New York time, from 1.6699 on Oct. 11. The currency market
was closed yesterday for a national holiday. The real last
reached today’s price level in September 2008.  “One of things is just general dollar weakness, if you
look at all commodity prices they’re all higher, all emerging
market currencies are practically inversely higher,” said
 Eduardo Suarez , an emerging-markets strategist at RBC Capital in
Toronto.  Oil rose 1.4 percent to $82.85 per barrel and Cocoa gained
1.1 percent to $2,880 a ton.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
11.43 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
