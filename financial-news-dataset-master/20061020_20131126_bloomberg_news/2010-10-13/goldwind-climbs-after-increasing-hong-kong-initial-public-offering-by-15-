Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co.  rose as much as 8 percent in Shenzhen trading
after boosting the size of its Hong Kong share sale to meet
additional demand.  The Chinese company raised about HK$1.1 billion ($142
million) before fees, issuing an additional 59 million shares in
the territory at HK$17.98 each, Urumqi-based Goldwind said in a
filing. That increased by about 15 percent its Hong Kong initial
public offering, which raised about HK$6.8 billion last week.  The company plans to use the sale proceeds to expand
production capacity and become one of the world’s top three
wind-turbine makers in five years. China, the world’s biggest
air polluter, may spend about 5 trillion yuan in the next decade
developing cleaner sources of energy to reduce emissions from
burning oil and coal, the government said in July.  Goldwind’s shares reached 21.98 yuan in Shenzhen today and
traded 6.6 percent higher at 21.71 yuan 3:00 p.m. local time. In
Hong Kong, the shares rose 2.9 percent to HK$20.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
