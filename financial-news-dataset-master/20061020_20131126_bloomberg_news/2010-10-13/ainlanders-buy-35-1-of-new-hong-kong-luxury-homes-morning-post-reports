Mainland Chinese purchased 35.1
percent of all new luxury apartments in Hong Kong during the
first half, the South China Morning Post reported, citing
Ricacorp Properties Ltd. Director Louis Ng.  The appreciation of the yuan and China’s measures aiming to
curb its own real estate prices made the city attractive to
mainland investors, the Hong Kong-based English-language
newspaper said, citing Ng.  Mainlanders purchased 22.5 percent of new luxury
apartments, defined as units selling for more than HK$12
million, in the second half of last year, the Post said. In the
first half of this year, mainland Chinese were the buyers of
16.7 percent of second-hand luxury apartments, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
