Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s stock
 rating  was cut by Credit Suisse Group AG, the third downgrade by
an analyst this month following the company’s $70 billion share
sale.  The rating on Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company is known, was lowered to “neutral” from “outperform”
because of concern the offering will dilute earnings per share,
Credit Suisse analyst  Emerson Leite  said today in a report.
Petrobras’s “expensive” acquisition of deepwater oil reserves
also contributed to the decision to cut the rating, he said.  Credit Suisse follows Barclays Plc and Itau Unibanco
Holding SA in reducing their recommendations on Petrobras after
the Rio de Janeiro-based company concluded the world’s largest
share offering last month. Petrobras paid 50 percent above the
“fair” value when it  acquired  5 billion barrels of deepwater
reserves from Brazil’s government in exchange for $42.5 billion,
Leite said.  Petrobras  fell 9 centavos, or 0.4 percent, to 25.6 reais at
2:15 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading. The stock has plunged 30 percent
this year, compared with a 4.8 percent gain for Brazil’s Bovespa
index.  Credit Suisse also cut is target price to $43 from $65,
according to the research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
