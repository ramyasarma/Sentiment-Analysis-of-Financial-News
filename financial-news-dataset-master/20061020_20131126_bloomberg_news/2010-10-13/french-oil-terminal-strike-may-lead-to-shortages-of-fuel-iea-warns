The French strike halting shipments
in and out of the Fos-Lavera oil terminal on the Mediterranean
may cause shortages of fuel, the  International Energy Agency 
said in its monthly report.  “By some estimates the strike could continue during the
next two weeks and lead to product shortages,” the Paris-based
agency said. “The strike is pushing European product cracks and
refining margins higher, drawing in products from abroad and
likely encouraging other refiners to increase run rates.”  The port closure started on Sept. 27 and cut crude supply
to six refineries in France and one in Switzerland, which are
all now running at reduced rates, the IEA said. This week has
seen more French refinery workers strike in protests against
national pension reform.  So far, the lost production is being replaced by commercial
stocks within France, the IEA said.  “Press reports have indicated that a large number of
diesel cargoes are heading to Europe from the U.S., but if the
Fos-Lavera port remains blocked logistics of delivering the
products to end-users in the region could be significantly
hampered,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
