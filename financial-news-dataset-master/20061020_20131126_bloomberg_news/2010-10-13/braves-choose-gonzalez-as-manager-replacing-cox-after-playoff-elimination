Fredi Gonzalez  replaced  Bobby Cox  as manager of the Atlanta Braves, the Major League
Baseball team said two days after being eliminated from the
playoffs.  Gonzalez had been the favorite for the job since he
was fired as manager of the Florida Marlins in June, the
 Atlanta Journal-Constitution  reported.  Cox, 69, announced a year ago that 2010 would be his
last season, and he managed his final game on Oct. 11 when
the Braves were eliminated from the National League
Division Series by the San Francisco Giants.  “Fredi brings a wealth of experience and great
enthusiasm to this job, and that is essential for a club
that continues to have expectations of playing in
October,” Braves General Manager  Frank Wren  said in a
statement.  Gonzalez, 46, is a former third-base coach for the
Braves and managed their top minor-league club. He was  276-
279  in 3 1/2 seasons with the Marlins. He and his family
have a year-round home in the Atlanta area.  Cox managed the Braves for  25 years , including the
last 21. He led the team to 15 postseason berths, including
the World Series championship in 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael Buteau  in
