CEZ AS, the Czech Republic’s largest
power producer, will delay the construction of two additional
reactors at its Temelin nuclear power plant, Hospodarske Noviny
reports, citing Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kocourek.  The construction could be delayed by as much as several
years, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified person from
the company. The main reason is uncertain demand for electricity
after 2020, according to the report.  CEZ selected Westinghouse Electric Co., Areva SA and a
Russian-Czech consortium led by ZAO Atomstroyexport as the three
bidders for the contract.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
