Raytheon Co., the world’s biggest
missile maker, sold $2 billion of debt in a three-part offering,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The company issued $400 million of 1.625 percent 5-year
notes that yield 60 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1 billion of 3.125 percent 10-year notes at a 77
basis-point spread and $600 million of 4.875 percent 30-year
bonds that pay 110 basis points more than benchmarks, said the
person, who declined to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly on the sale. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.   Proceeds will be used to buy back 5.5 percent debt due
November 2012 and 5.375 percent notes maturing in April 2013,
Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon said today in a regulatory
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
