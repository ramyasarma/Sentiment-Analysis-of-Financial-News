Corn futures fell for the first time
in five sessions on speculation that the highest prices in two
years will curb demand.  Profit for livestock farmers, dairy producers and ethanol
refiners fell as corn costs surged as much as 57 percent since
the end of June, said Ben Buckner, an analyst for  AgResource Co. 
in Chicago. Before today, corn soared 19 percent over four
sessions after the U.S. government reduced its crop estimate.  “The market is telling us that corn prices are getting
very close to levels that will ration demand,” Buckner said.
“Livestock producers are starting to look for and find
alternative sources of feed, and spot ethanol margins are near
breakeven.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 9.75 cents, or 1.7
percent, to close at $5.6925 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the biggest drop since Oct. 1. Earlier,
the price reached $5.88, the highest level since August 2008.  Ethanol futures for November delivery have jumped 44
percent since the end of June. Cattle futures gained 9.4
percent, and milk prices advanced 14 percent.  Corn output will fall 3.4 percent from a year earlier,
reducing reserve inventories before the 2011 harvest to the
lowest level since 1997, the Department of Agriculture said on
Oct. 8. The USDA cut its yield forecast by 6.7 bushels an acre
to 155.8 bushels, compared with a month earlier, the biggest
drop ever in the month of October.  Ethanol Ruling  Prices also fell after the government said it will grant a
request from ethanol producers to increase concentrations for
the fuel additive in gasoline for vehicles made in 2007 and
later.  The Environmental Protection Agency today agreed to let
refiners add as much as 15 percent ethanol into a new fuel
blend, up from the current 10 percent. A decision on using more
ethanol in fuel for vehicles made from 2001 through 2006 will be
made in November after results of further testing of the blend,
the EPA said in a statement.  Today the U.S. provides a 45-cent-a-gallon tax credit to
gasoline refiners that make a blend of as much as 10 percent
ethanol. The government imposes a 54-cent import tariff per
gallon to deter foreign competitors.  The approval “is old news to the market and since it is
only for 2007 and later models, it should not impact demand,”
said  David Smoldt , a vice president for FCStone LLC in West Des
Moines, Iowa. “The $1,000,000 question is what the government
is going to do with credits and tariffs. No one has a good
feeling about the direction the government will take on the
issue.”  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
