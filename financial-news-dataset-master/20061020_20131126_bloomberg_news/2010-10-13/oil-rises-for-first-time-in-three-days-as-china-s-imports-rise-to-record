Oil jumped to the highest level in a
week as China, the world’s largest energy consuming country,
reported record crude imports in September, and the
International Energy Agency raised its global demand forecast.  Futures rose for the first day in three as the imports
climbed 11 percent from August to 23.3 million metric tons, or
5.52 million barrels a day, according to preliminary data from
the General Administration of Customs in Beijing. The IEA
boosted its usage outlook by 300,000 barrels a day for 2010 and
2011.  “It was a combination overnight of the Chinese imports,
the IEA forecast and a selloff in the dollar which conspired to
create a perfect storm for the bulls today,” said  Stephen Schork , president of consultant Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,
Pennsylvania.  Crude for November delivery climbed $1.34, or 1.6 percent,
to settle at $83.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest level since Oct. 6. Prices have risen 12
percent in the past year.  Prices increased from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles tumbled 4.01 million barrels to 362.1 million.
November oil rose $1.46, or 1.8 percent, to $83.13 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  Brent crude for November settlement on the  ICE  Futures
Europe exchange in London gained $1.14, or 1.4 percent, to
$84.64 a barrel.  Demand Forecasts  The IEA increased its forecast amid signs of “apparently
resurgent” demand in the U.S., Germany and Japan in the last
quarter, the Paris-based energy advisory agency said today in
its monthly Oil Market Report. Crude use worldwide will average
86.9 million barrels a day in 2010 and 88.2 million barrels a
day in 2011, the IEA said.  “The IEA report is a very strong one that acknowledges the
strength of the demand seen over the last few months,” said
 Amrita Sen , a London-based analyst at Barclays Capital, the
investment banking arm of Barclays Plc.  The U.S. Energy Department also raised its demand outlook.  The world will consume 86.06 million barrels a day this
year, the department forecast in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook . That’s up from 85.95 million last month and 84.33
million in 2009. Demand will climb to 87.44 million in 2011,
80,000 barrels a day higher than last month’s projection.  Weaker Dollar  Futures also rose as the dollar fell against the euro and
other currencies, boosting commodities’ appeal as an alternative
investment. The  Dollar Index , which tracks the U.S. currency
against six major peers, slid 0.4 percent at 3:11 p.m. in New
York to the lowest level since January on a closing basis.  “This is all about the dollar and quantitative easing,”
or Federal Reserve purchases of debt to stimulate the economy,
said  Bill O’Grady , chief market strategist at Confluence
Investment Management in St. Louis. “If the Fed continues the
policy that it’s running, you’re going to reinflate the global
economy, and that’s going to be bullish for commodities.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will keep
output quotas unchanged when it meets tomorrow because the oil
market is well-balanced for the next few months,  Rafael Ramirez ,
Venezuela’s energy and oil minister, said today in Vienna. The
12-member group pumps 40 percent of the world’s crude.  “All the ministers agree that we should leave the level of
production stable,” he said. “We’re hoping to maintain the
price and to increase that a little bit to between $90 and $100
a barrel.”  The  Energy Department  increased its oil price forecast for
2011 by $1 a barrel to $83. The estimate included an assumption
that OPEC will boost its output as prices climb, tempering a
bigger gain. The department raised its 2010 outlook by 60 cents
to $77.97. Oil has averaged $77.90 a barrel in 2010.  U.S. Outlook  OPEC production will “increase over the next year or two”
in response to economic growth,  Richard Newell , administrator of
the Energy Information Administration, the department’s
statistical arm, said at a press conference in Washington. This
“should keep prices from rising dramatically.”  U.S. oil supplies probably rose 1.45 million barrels, or
0.4 percent, last week from 360.9 million in the prior seven-day
period, based on the median of 18 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg survey before an Energy Department report tomorrow.
That would be the highest level since June. Gasoline and
distillate inventories fell in the survey.  The weekly statistics from the U.S. government and the
Washington-based American Petroleum Institute are coming out a
day later than usual this week because of the Columbus Day
federal holiday on Oct. 11.  French Strike  Workers at refineries across France and at Marseille oil
terminals extended a strike, threatening to cause fuel shortages
starting next week. Workers at 10 of mainland France’s 12 crude-
processing plants were on strike, CGT union representative
 Charles Foulard  said today by phone.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 623,486
contracts as of 3:17 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 721,433
contracts yesterday, 5.9 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.44 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
