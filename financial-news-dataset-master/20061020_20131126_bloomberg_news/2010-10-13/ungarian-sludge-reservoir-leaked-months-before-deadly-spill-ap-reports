The Hungarian reservoir of red
sludge, which last week spilled a deadly wave of the toxic
material, had leaked months before the accident, the Associated
Press said today.  An aerial photo of the reservoir, taken by the Hungarian
company  Interspect  on June 11, showed a leak at the northern
wall of the reservoir, which collapsed on Oct. 4, the news
agency said, citing Interspect director  Gabor Bako . The company,
which specializes in aerial photography, shared the photo with
universities and environmental groups, Bako told AP.  The government’s environmental agency examined the
reservoir two weeks before the accident, which claimed eight
lives and inundated three villages, and found everything in
order, AP said. Police are scrutinizing the photo as part of an
investigation into the causes of the accident, according to AP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
