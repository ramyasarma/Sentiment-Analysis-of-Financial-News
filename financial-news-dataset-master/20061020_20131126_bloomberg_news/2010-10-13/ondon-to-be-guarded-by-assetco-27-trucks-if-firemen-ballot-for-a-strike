A private company,  AssetCo Plc , will
fight fires in London armed with 27 fire engines if the Fire
Brigades Union goes out on strike.  The results of an industrial-action ballot by the union’s
5,500 London members will be revealed by 3 p.m. tomorrow,
according to a union spokeswoman, Helen Hague.  The London Fire Brigade has withdrawn 27 trucks from
service out of 160 as part of contingency plans, according to
spokesman Sam Spindlow. The brigade can’t call on members of the
military as it did in the last strike in 2002 and 2003, he said.  “This is not a decision that has been taken lightly and
even at this late stage I am urging firefighters to consider the
effects strike action might have,” London Fire Commissioner Ron
Dobson said today in an e-mailed statement. “London’s fire
authority has a legal duty to provide a fire and rescue service
at all times.”  In July 2009, AssetCo was awarded a five-year contract to
supply emergency service to the brigade of up to 700 staff. The
South Ruislip, England-based company already owns fire and
rescue vehicles at 111 of the brigade’s stations.  Hague wouldn’t talk about the union management’s plans if
it is authorized for action. The emergency arrangements are
designed to provide “an acceptable level of contingency cover”
in a strike, the Brigade said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
