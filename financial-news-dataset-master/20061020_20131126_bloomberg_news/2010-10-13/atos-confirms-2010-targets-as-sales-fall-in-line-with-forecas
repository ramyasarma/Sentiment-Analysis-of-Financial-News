Atos Origin SA , France’s second-
biggest provider of computer services, confirmed its full-year
outlook after third-quarter sales declined in line with its
targets.  Revenue at Paris-based Atos fell 3.5 percent to 1.21
billion euros in the quarter, compared with 1.25 billion euros
($1.8 billion) last year, the company said in a statement. The
consulting unit saw the largest decline, with sales sliding 11.2
percent to 48 million euros, while transactional services sales
climbed 5.5 percent to 258 million euros.  Information technology companies, which are suffering as
austerity measures crimp national budgets, are looking to
increase their reliance on the private sector and protect
government contracts. Along with  Cap Gemini SA  and  Logica Plc ,
Atos last month announced it had reached a deal with the U.K.
government to protect existing work and cut costs.  Atos forecast a “slight revenue organic decrease” for
2010 earlier this year. The company supplies IT services to the
Olympic Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
