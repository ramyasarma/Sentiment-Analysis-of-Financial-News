Japan’s  Topix  index fell, reversing
gains with banks leading the decline, as pessimism over the
nation’s economic outlook overshadowed expectations the U.S.
Federal Reserve will take measures to revive growth.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.  and Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest banks by market value,
lost at least 2 percent. Mitsubishi Estate Co., the country’s
biggest developer by market value, dropped 1.7 percent.
Exporters climbed on expectations the Fed will pump more cash
into the U.S. economy.  “Stocks advanced on expectations the Fed will pursue
further monetary easing, but the gain ran out of steam in Japan
because fundamentally there’re no reasons to buy Japanese
stocks,” said  Hideaki Higashi , strategist at SMBC Friend
Securities Co. “Banks and real-estate companies climbed after
the Bank of Japan took easing measures, but the effect did not
last for long.”  The  Topix  index slid 0.2 percent to 822.65 with about three
stocks dropping for every two that advanced at the 3 p.m. market
close in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.2 percent
to 9,403.51.  The Topix has declined 9.4 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 4.9 percent by the  S&P 500  and 3.4 percent by the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
an average of 14.7 times estimated  earnings , compared with 14
times for the S&P and 12.1 times for the Stoxx.  Banks, Developers Retreat  Banks and real-estate companies were the  heaviest drag  on
the Topix index as investors sold the shares to lock in recent
gains, according to SMBC’s Higashi. Banks rose 1.7 percent while
real-estate companies advanced 4.2 percent between Oct. 5, when
the Bank of Japan cut its benchmark interest rate and increased
purchases of assets, and yesterday. That compares with a decline
of 1 percent by the benchmark index during the period.  Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 2 percent to 394 yen and Sumitomo
Mitsui lost 2.2 percent to 2,411 yen. Resona Holdings Inc.
tumbled 5.4 percent to 665 yen, the largest decline in the
Nikkei 225.  Mitsubishi Estate  retreated 1.7 percent to 1,467 yen
and Mitsui Fudosan Co., the second-largest property developer,
sank 0.9 percent to 1,553 yen.  Companies that rely on overseas sales advanced as minutes
of the Federal Reserve’s meeting last month showed the central
bank was prepared to buy more government debt to stabilize the
recovery.  Nissan, Kyocera  “The absolute amount of money to be invested in risk
assets including stocks should increase because of the low
interest rates and a rise in money supply,” said  Kenji Sekiguchi , general manager of strategic research and investment
at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees about $75
billion in Tokyo. “The trend will likely continue until the
next Fed meeting.”  Nissan Motor Co. , which derives 35 percent of its sales in
North America, rose 1.9 percent to 741 yen. Kyocera Corp., an
electronic-component maker that gets 17 percent of its revenue
in the U.S., rallied 2.4 percent to 8,380 yen. Canon Inc., which
gets about 80 percent of its revenue overseas, gained 0.3
percent to 3,845 yen.  Machinery makers including  Fanuc Ltd. , Japan’s No. 1 maker
of industrial robots, contributed to earlier gains as the
nation’s machinery orders rose more than economists expected.
The orders, an indicator of business investment in three to six
months, increased 10.1 percent in August from July.  Fanuc jumped 2.3 percent to 11,010 yen.  THK Co. , an
industrial machinery maker, advanced 3.7 percent to 1,651 yen.
Makita Corp., a power-tool maker, climbed 0.7 percent to 2,687
yen.  Corporate capital expenditure “is still on its way to
recovery, and will likely continue to be resilient despite
mounting headwinds from the financial markets,”  Junko Nishioka ,
chief economist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd., wrote in a report.
“A resilient corporate capex may help in preventing a double-
dip economy.”  Dena Co., a social media website operator, plummeted 7.8
percent to 2,189 yen. The company said it will sell shares to
fund a $400 million purchase of Ngmoco, a builder of games for
Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  To contact the reporters for this story:
