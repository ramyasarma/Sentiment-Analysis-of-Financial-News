 Thailand’s Central Bank Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul said yesterday’s decision by the finance
ministry to remove a tax exemption for foreigners on income from
domestic bonds was “in the right direction.”  “This problem is a global problem that happens in many
countries, and what we are trying to do now is reduce the impact
as much as we can,” Prasarn told reporters in Bangkok late
yesterday. “We also try to manage the foreign-exchange rate
under a managed float system and make it efficient to help
reduce the impact on businesses.”  Prasarn said the central bank is studying measures adopted
by other countries to control capital flows. “We are looking at
that, but we will use it or not depending on the situation,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
