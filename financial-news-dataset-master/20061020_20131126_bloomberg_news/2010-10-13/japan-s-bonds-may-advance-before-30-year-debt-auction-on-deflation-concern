Japanese 10-year  bonds  rose after
the yen’s jump to a 15-year high versus the dollar rekindled
speculation the central bank will ease monetary policy.  Benchmark  yields  fell after having the biggest gain in a
month yesterday as a measure of demand increased to the highest
since 2002 at an auction of 600 billion yen ($7.39 billion) in
30-year government bonds today. A Bank of Japan report showed
the nation’s producer prices unexpectedly declined in September,
adding to evidence that deflation will persist.  “The smooth passage of the auction and the yen’s
appreciation boosted the bond market,” said  RuiXue Xu , a
strategist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd., a unit of Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. “In the face of the stronger yen, pressure
is mounting on the central bank to further ease policy.”  The  yield  on 10-year debt fell two basis points to 0.875
percent at 3:21 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 0.8 percent debt
due September 2020 added 0.181 yen to 99.315. The yield jumped
4.5 basis points yesterday, the most for 10-year yields since
Sept. 2. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery rose 0.01 to
close at 143.92 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Japan’s currency advanced to 81.14 per dollar today, a
level not seen since April 1995. A stronger yen reduces the
value of overseas sales at Japanese companies when repatriated.  The nation’s  producer prices  fell 0.1 percent in September
from a year earlier, the Bank of Japan said. Economists had
estimated that prices remained unchanged.  ‘Hoarding Cash’  “The biggest cause of Japan’s deflation is businesses
hoarding cash and not investing,” said  Hisakazu Amano , who
helps oversee about $29 billion at Tokyo-based T&D Asset
Management Co. “Ten-year yields may fall below 0.8 percent.”  Deflation, or a general drop in prices, enhances the
purchasing power of the fixed payments from debt.  The Bank of Japan on Oct. 5 cut its key interest rate to a
range of zero to 0.1 percent and announced the creation of a 5
trillion yen fund to buy government and corporate debt,
exchange-traded funds and real-estate investment trusts.  Today’s sale of 30-year debt drew bids valued at 5.4 times
the amount on offer, the highest since May 2002.  Japan’s economy may unravel in the next two to three years,
and its interest payments will exceed revenue,  J. Kyle Bass , the
head of Dallas-based Hayman Advisors LP, said yesterday. “Japan
can’t fund itself internally,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
