Pro Bowl linebacker  Shawne Merriman 
must be cut by the San Diego Chargers when he recovers from
injuries that have limited his play this season, the National
Football League team said.  The Chargers placed Merriman, a six-year veteran, on the
reserve-injured list with a “minor-injury designation” for a
calf problem. The designation means the linebacker “must be
released by the team when he becomes healthy,” the Chargers
said in a  news release .  “I can’t say enough about my teammates, the coaching staff
and of course the fans who have made my career with the Chargers
such an amazing experience,” Merriman, 26, said in an e-mailed
statement. “I am approaching this situation as an opportunity
to grow as a player and to bring my leadership and talents to a
new organization.”  Merriman, the NFL’s defensive rookie of the year in 2005
and a three-time Pro Bowl selection, missed the season opener
against the Kansas City Chiefs with an Achilles injury, the team
said.  He played briefly against the Jacksonville Jaguars, injured
his calf against the Seattle Seahawks and missed a game against
the Arizona Cardinals, before reinjuring his calf in last week’s
game against the Oakland Raiders.  The NFL suspended Merriman for four games in 2006 after he
failed a drug test. His lawyer,  David Cornwell , said Merriman
tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid Nandralone after
unwittingly ingesting it in a supplement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
