Saudi Arabian shares retreated to
the lowest level in more than five weeks after six of the
kingdom’s lenders reported declines in third-quarter profit as
they set aside money to cover bad debt.  Saudi British Bank,  the lender 40 percent-owned by HSBC
Holdings Plc, fell 1.6 percent after it said third-quarter
profit declined 26 percent.  Arab National Bank,  Saudi Arabia’s
sixth-largest publicly traded lender by assets, slumped the most
since May after net income dropped 45 percent. The 143-stock
 Tadawul All Share Index  declined 0.7 percent to 6,302.52, the
lowest since Sept. 5, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The
remaining six stock indexes in the Gulf Cooperation Council
gained, with the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  rising 0.2 percent
after global markets increased.  “Investors have shifted their attention to the earning
season, which led to decoupling from international markets,”
said Amro Halwani, a trader at Shuaa Capital PSC in Saudi
Arabia. “Sentiment towards banks is poor at the moment
following earning releases; we’re seeing retail investors
dumping the sector’s stocks following the surprisingly
disappointing figures.”  Saudi banks’ earnings have been hurt since the onset of the
global credit crisis as provisions for bad debt rose and lending
slowed after the Saad and Algosaibi business groups defaulted on
at least $15.7 billion of loans.  Lenders in Saudi Arabia had been reluctant to resume
lending even after the central bank cut interest rates and the
government announced a $400 billion spending program to restart
the economy. Saudi bank credit to industry rose 3.3 percent in
August from a year earlier, compared with 4.9 percent in July,
according to data from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, the
country’s central bank.  Banks Retreat  Saudi British shares fell to 42 riyals, the lowest since
July 7. Third-quarter profit decreased 26 percent to 419 million
riyals ($111 million) from a year earlier because of provisions,
the bank said yesterday. Arab National retreated 3.1 percent,
the most since May 25, to 37.9 riyals. Net income dropped to 347
million riyals from 633 million riyals a year earlier.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  jumped 1.2 percent. Dubai’s
 DFM General Index  and Qatar’s  QE Index  advanced 0.9 percent.
Kuwait’s  SE Price Index  rose 0.3 percent, Oman’s  MSM 30 Index 
climbed 0.5 percent and Bahrain’s  gauge  gained 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
