Asia gasoil crack spreads, a measure
of refiner profitability, fell today on concern there will be an
oversupply after data showed Chinese oil product exports climbed.  The  crack spread  declined 39 cents to $13.06 a barrel at
10:57 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from broker PVM Oil
Associates.  Gasoil , or diesel, swaps for November climbed 80
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $94.50 a barrel, PVM data showed.  China’s oil product exports, including diesel fuel and
gasoline, climbed to 2.09 million metric tons in September from
2.07 million in August, according to preliminary data released
by the General Customs Administration today.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 38 cents to
$7.06 a barrel, PVM data showed. November  high-sulfur fuel oil 
for 180-centistoke swaps climbed $5.25 to $483.50 a metric ton,
according to PVM.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged at $8.25 a ton, PVM said. A narrowing
 viscosity spread  shows bunker, or marine fuel, climbed more than
higher-quality fuel oil.  Benchmark Japan open-specification naphtha forwards for
second-half November delivery were bid at $768 a ton against
offers at $771, according to broker Ginga Petroleum Singapore
Pte. Naphtha’s premium to Brent crude oil futures yesterday was
at $129.41 a ton, up from $92.22 a month ago, according to
calculations by Bloomberg.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha rose 5 cents yesterday to
$5.30 a barrel, Bloomberg calculations showed. A widening
reforming margin indicates motor fuel is more profitable
compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
