Copper prices may be more than 10
percent higher on average in the fourth quarter as demand
outpaces supply growth, according to a state purchasing agency
in South Korea, Asia’s third-biggest base metals buyer.  Copper may average more than $8,000 a metric ton in the
quarter ending Dec. 31 and may continue climbing through the
first half of 2011, Lee Key Man, head of the international goods
bureau at the Public Procurement Service, said in an interview.
The metal used in homes and appliances averaged $7,266.78 in the
third quarter, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Prices on the London Metal Exchange have gained 13 percent
this year, reaching a 27-month high today, as inventories
dropped and  the dollar  slumped on speculation the Federal
Reserve will step up measures to stimulate the U.S. economy.  “Despite a fast pace in the global economic recovery this
year, supply growth for copper seems to have been very slow,”
Lee said. “The metal is likely to advance to higher levels on
slowing supply growth amid excessive liquidity in global
markets.”  Diego Hernandez, chief executive officer of Codelco, the
world’s biggest copper producer, said yesterday in an interview
that he expects a “tighter” copper market next year because of
continued demand from China and a lack of new supply.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also increased its forecast for
copper, estimating prices would jump to $11,000 a ton by the end
of next year. Copper has “the strongest fundamentals” because
of low inventories, Jeffrey Currie, Goldman’s head of
commodities research, said on Oct. 6.  Dropping Inventories  LME inventories  shrank by 17 percent in the third quarter
and dropped to 371,750 tons yesterday, the lowest since Oct. 29
last year. Copper consumption will outpace supply by 58,000 tons
this year, compared with a previous forecast for a surplus,
Standard Bank Plc said in a report yesterday.  The Korean agency, which stockpiles mostly non-ferrous
metals, is prioritizing purchases of copper and tin in the
coming months because the metals are likely to be in “short
supply,” Lee said, without elaborating on buying plans.  Copper for delivery in three months on the LME climbed as
much as 0.8 percent to $8,415 a ton today, the highest price
since July 8, 2008. The metal reached an all-time high of $8,940
on July 2, 2008.  ‘Buying Plans’  Tin, used as a solder and in packaging, has rallied 56
percent this year, reaching a record $26,790 a ton on Oct. 6 on
concern that supply disruptions in Indonesia, the biggest
exporter, and China, the biggest producer, will cut stockpiles.
Barclays Capital earlier this month predicted a supply shortage
of 15,000 tons next year, the biggest since at least 2003. The
metal last traded at $26,500 a ton.  “We’ve not come up with overall buying plans for next year
yet, but we expect to purchase more actively,” Lee said in the
e-mail interview.  The agency  bought 34,262 tons of six metals -- aluminum,
copper, lead, zinc, tin and nickel -- in the first half of this
year, 74 percent less than a year earlier, as the domestic
construction industry slowed and prices surged, Lee said. Copper
purchases plunged to 999 tons in the period, from 44,016 tons a
year earlier, and aluminum buying dropped to 26,940 tons from
81,970 tons.  The Daejeon-based buyer has 2,000 to 3,000 small- and
medium-sized companies as customers and meets about 8 percent of
the country’s metals demand. It met with foreign resource
suppliers in London this week to seek ways to attract more
bidders to its metal tenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
