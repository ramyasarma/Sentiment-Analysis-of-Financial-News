Investors should buy the euro
against the Swedish krona and bet on a 2 percent gain by the
common currency, according to Standard Bank Plc.  Standard Bank recommended ending the trade should the krona
strengthen to 9.1160 per euro,  Steve Barrow , the bank’s London-
based head of research for Group-of-10 currencies, wrote today
in an e-mailed note. The bank set an initial target of 9.3590
krona followed by 9.4690, Barrow said in the note.  The krona traded at 9.2702 per euro at 10:50 a.m. in
London. It has advanced 10.6 percent against the 16-nation euro
since the end of 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
