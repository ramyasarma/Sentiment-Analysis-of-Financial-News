Private investment in clean-energy
projects rose 11 percent in the third quarter as lending for
offshore wind projects increased, Bloomberg New Energy Finance
said.  New loans and equity for low-carbon power projects reached
$37.9 billion compared with $34 billion in the same period of
2009, the London-based research group said in an e-mailed
statement. Investment in the second quarter was $33.9 billion.  The clean-energy industry may attract record spending of
almost $200 billion this year when government outlays are
included, New Energy Finance forecast. Governments from Berlin
to Beijing are promoting wind and solar power to reduce the
emission of greenhouse gases. Germany plans to lower gas
discharges by 40 percent over the next decade. China, the
world’s biggest air polluter, may spend about 5 trillion yuan
($750 billion) over the period.  “The latest hot spot is infrastructure spending for North
Sea offshore wind,” New Energy Finance Chief Executive  Michael Liebreich  said in the statement. “It is reassuring to see
billions being committed, although this is only the start.”  Asset finance reached a record $32.8 billion, with $1.9
billion invested in cables to connect wind generators in the
North Sea to the German mainland. China also posted a record,
with $13.5 billion invested mainly in wind generators. Clean
energy investment slipped to $162 billion last year from $173
billion in 2008.  New Energy Finance is the London-based analysis arm of
