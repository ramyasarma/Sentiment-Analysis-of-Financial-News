Gold futures rose to a record
$1,368.90 an ounce amid mounting investor demand for the metal
as an alternative to currencies. Silver extended a rally to the
highest level since 1980.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UniCredit SpA and Citigroup Inc.
have raised price forecasts as the metal approached another
record high.  The dollar  was down against a basket of six major
currencies on speculation the Federal Reserve will ease monetary
policy further to spur economic growth.  “Gold has become the world’s third reservable currency as
all currencies seem intent upon racing each other downward,”
said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter. He advised clients to buy the
metal.  Gold futures for December delivery climbed $20.80, or 1.5
percent, to $1,367.50 at 10:12 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
The previous all-time high was $1,366 on Oct. 7.  Goldman Sachs forecast a price of $1,650 in 12 months.
UniCredit analyst  Jochen Hitzfeld  in Munich raised his 2011
target to $1,500. Citigroup’s “short and medium term” forecast
is $1,450.  “This momentum higher will attract investors to
participate in the next move up,” said  Bayram Dincer , an
analyst at LGT Capital Management in Pfaeffikon, Switzerland.  A Fed purchase of $500 billion of government securities
would lead to lower interest rates, weighing on the dollar and
aiding gold, Dincer said.  Treasury Purchases  The central bank in March finished $1.7 trillion in
purchases of Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities and housing
agency bonds. The Fed has kept its benchmark lending rate at
zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  Gold, which pays no interest, becomes a more attractive
investment when borrowing costs decline. Before today, the metal
rose 23 percent this year.  “Both gold and the dollar agree that Ben Bernanke will be
victorious in his quest to foment a robust rate of inflation,”
said  Michael Pento , a senior economist at Euro Pacific Capital
in New York.  Gold for immediate delivery reached a record $1,367.95.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 50.8 cents, or
2.2 percent, to $23.655 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached
$23.71, the highest level since September 1980.  Platinum futures for January delivery gained $23.30, or 1.4
percent, to $1,706.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery climbed $11.35, or
2 percent, to $592 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
