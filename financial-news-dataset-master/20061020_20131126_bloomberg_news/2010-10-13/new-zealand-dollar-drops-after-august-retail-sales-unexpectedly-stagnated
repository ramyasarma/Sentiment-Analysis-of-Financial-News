Australia’s currency rallied to the
highest level since it began trading freely in 1983, rising to
within a half-cent of parity with the U.S. dollar on speculation
Federal Reserve easing will debase the greenback further.  The Aussie remained higher as an e-mailed report from the
Melbourne Institute for Economic and Social Research showed
monthly consumer inflationary expectations for October rose to
3.8 percent from 3.1 percent. Australia’s central bank aims to
keep inflation in a range of 2 to 3 percent.  “For the Aussie dollar, some of the momentum has been
generated due to just broad dollar selling,” said  Jessica Hoversen , a Chicago-based analyst at the futures broker MF
Global Holdings Ltd. “A lot of it is the fundamentals in
Australia.”  Australia’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 99.38 U.S.
cents at 12:10 p.m. in New York, from 99.05 cents yesterday,
after touching a record 99.94 U.S. cents. New Zealand’s dollar
dropped 0.3 percent to 75.82 U.S. cents, from 76.06 cents. It
reached 76.44, the highest level since July 2008.  The U.S. central bank said in a statement following its
Sept. 21 policy meeting that it’s prepared “to provide
additional accommodation if needed” to support the recovery. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will speak tomorrow in Boston.  “Heightening prospects of the U.S. Fed restarting
quantitative easing are providing tailwinds for the AUD/USD,”
wrote  John Kyriakopoulos , head of currency strategy at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney in a note to clients.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.5 percent in  Australia  and 3
percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in  Japan 
and the U.S., attracting investors to the South Pacific nations’
higher-yielding assets.  Australian bonds fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-
year note rising 0.02 percentage point to 5.03 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New Zealand’s two-year
swap rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating rates, fell
0.05 percentage point to 3.72 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
