Prime Minister  David Cameron 
appointed a military assistant to his staff to “strengthen the
government’s links to the armed forces” after clashing with
Defense Secretary  Liam Fox  over budget cuts.  Colonel Jim Morris of the Royal Marines will provide
Cameron with “assistance on a full range of military issues,
with a focus on ongoing operations in Afghanistan,” the prime
minister’s office in London said in an e-mailed statement today.  Disputes over the military budget, which will be set out
next week in statements to Parliament, have been the most public
within Cameron’s coalition. Fox warned the premier in a letter
leaked last month that deep cuts to armed-forces spending while
Britain is at war in Afghanistan would hit soldiers’ morale and
damage the ruling Conservative Party.  Asked if the premier is bypassing Fox by recruiting Morris,
Cameron’s spokesman  Steve Field  told reporters that the defense
ministry had been “completely involved” in the appointment.
“This is about making things better, not fixing a problem,”
Field said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
