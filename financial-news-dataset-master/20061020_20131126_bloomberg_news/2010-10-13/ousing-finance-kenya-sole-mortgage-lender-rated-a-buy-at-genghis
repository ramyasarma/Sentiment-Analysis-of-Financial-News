Housing Finance Ltd. , Kenya’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, was rated “buy” with a price
target of 35.6 shillings in new coverage at Genghis Capital Ltd.  “HF has enhanced its balance sheet through the issue of a
10 billion-shilling ($124 million) medium-term note program into
the local fixed-income market to fund new business,” the
Nairobi-based brokerage said in an e-mailed note to clients
dated today.  The company received 40 percent more bids than the 5
billion shillings of bonds offered in a sale last month, it said
Oct. 6.  Housing Finance shares were unchanged at 27.25 shillings at
10:26 a.m. in Nairobi. The stock has gained 51 percent this
year, outperforming a 43 percent increase in the benchmark  NSE-
20 index  over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
