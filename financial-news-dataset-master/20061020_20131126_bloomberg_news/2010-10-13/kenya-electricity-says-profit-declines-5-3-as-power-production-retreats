Kenya Electricity Generating Co. 
Ltd., the East African nation’s biggest power producer, said
full-year profit dropped 5.3 percent after output declined
following a drought.  Net income fell to 1.96 billion shillings ($24.2 million),
or 0.89 shillings a share, in the year to June 30, compared with
2.07 billion shillings, or 0.94 shillings, a year earlier, the
company said in a statement today in the Nairobi-based Daily
Nation. Revenue was 12 percent lower at 11.1 billion shillings
from, it said.  “Our financial performance showed a slight stagnation due
to severe drought,” Managing Director  Edward Njoroge  said. “This
impacted significantly our hydro-generation.”  Kenya Electricity said in June 2008 that water flows into
Masinga dam, the reservoir for four power stations, were at
their lowest level since 1949. Hydropower plants account for
about 65 percent of Kenya’s total electricity generation and the
lower water levels led Kenya to schedule power cuts between Aug.
6 and Oct. 22 last year.  Rainfall received early this year was “good” and there are
unlikely to be any outages in the “short term,” Njoroge said.  KenGen plans to increase its power generation capacity by
5,000 megawatts by 2013 and another 1,500 megawatts by 2018, he
said. Projects nearing completion include a 20-megawatt hydro
plant at Tana and a 120-megawatt thermal facility in Kipeveu,
both in southern Kenya. The projects will be completed in
November and December respectively, Njoroge said.  “We are confident of providing sufficient and reliable
electric power to the Kenyan people as well as creating value
for shareholders,” Njoroge added.  KenGen’s stock has advanced 36 percent so far this year,
underperforming a 43 percent increase in the benchmark  NSE-20
index  over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
