A Dutch citizen who pleaded guilty
in 2009 to plotting to kill American troops in Iraq with
roadside bombs will be released after Dutch judges cut his 25-
year prison term to eight years.  The Rotterdam district court ordered that the time Wesa al-
Delaema has spent in detention in both the U.S. and the
Netherlands will be “completely reduced from his prison term,”
it said in a statement on its website today. “He’ll be released
today,” Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for the national prosecutor,
said by telephone.  Al-Delaema, who was born in Iraq, entered a guilty plea in
Feb. 2009 before a  U.S. District Court  in Washington to a charge
of conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens outside the country, the
Justice Department said at the time. The U.S. said al-Delaema,
who was arrested by Dutch law enforcement in 2005, was to serve
his sentence in the Netherlands.  Delaema placed roadside bombs targeting soldiers in
Fallujah, Iraq, and the U.S. government said it seized
videotapes that showed him and fellow conspirators demonstrating
how they planted the bombs. The Justice Department said at the
time it was the first U.S. prosecution of terrorist activities
in Iraq.  The case is 10/965035-10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
