The Egyptian economy expanded an
annual 5.6 percent in the third quarter, boosted by tourism,
manufacturing and domestic consumption, cabinet spokesman  Magdy Rady  said today.  Growth accelerated from a revised rate of 5.4 percent in
the previous three months. The government had initially said the
economy expanded an annual 5.9 percent in the period between
April and June.  “This is slightly better than our forecast,” said  Alia Mamdouh , an economist at Cairo-based investment bank CI Capital.
She had forecast 5.4 percent growth for the first quarter.  The government expects the economy to expand at least 6
percent in the current fiscal year ending June 2011, compared
with a revised rate of 5.1 percent in the previous year. The
economy of the most populous Arab country relies on
manufacturing, tourism and foreign direct investment for growth.
These factors helped gross domestic product expand at an average
rate of 7 percent in the three fiscal years through June 2008.  Growth slowed to 4.7 percent in the following fiscal year
due to the global financial crisis, prompting the government to
boost public spending to offset the decline in private
investments.  “We are not happy that public investments are more than
private investments,” Rady told reporters in Cairo.  Egypt’s benchmark EGX30 stock index has gained 11 percent
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
