Stocks  rose, sending the benchmark
global index to a six-month high, as China announced record
currency reserves, the Federal Reserve signaled it will protect
the recovery and CSX Corp.’s earnings beat forecasts. A gauge of
commodities rose to a two-year high as the dollar and yen fell.  The  MSCI World Index  gained 1.2 percent at 4 p.m. in New
York to the highest level since April 26. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index climbed 0.7 percent to 1,178.1, the highest close

Index of commodities gained 0.6 percent to the highest level
since October 2008. The yen weakened against all but one of its
16 most-traded counterparts and the dollar fell versus 14.  China’s foreign-exchange reserves increased by a record to
$2.65 trillion at the end of last month while a 25 percent jump
in exports lifted its trade surplus to $16.9 billion,
reinforcing optimism the country will continue to lead the
global recovery. The Fed said in minutes published yesterday it
was prepared to ease monetary policy “before long.” CSX, the
second-largest publicly U.S. traded railroad, jumped 4.2 percent

market, and everyone’s looking ahead to” bond purchases by the
Fed to spur growth. “All risk assets have responded
dramatically just to expectations.”  Intel, JPMorgan  The  S&P 500  extended this week’s advance to 1.1 percent

reporting earnings. Intel lost 2.7 percent after rising for six
days in a row. The world’s biggest chipmaker predicted revenue
for the fourth quarter of $11.4 billion, plus or minus $400
million, as demand from emerging markets helps offset slumping
sales in the U.S. and Europe. JPMorgan lost 1.4 percent as
revenue fell short of some analysts’ estimates.  Technology shares contributed the most to today’s rally in
the S&P 500. Cisco Systems Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and

machinery orders unexpectedly rose 10.1 percent and Australia’s
consumer confidence rebounded 3.3 percent.  The MSCI Emerging

2.4 percent, the most since May, as Infosys Technologies Ltd.
rallied to a record high.  The yield on 30-year Treasuries rose to a record relative
to 10-year notes amid speculation the Fed will buy medium-term
debt to keep borrowing costs down. The difference  reached  1.40

1977. The government sold $21 billion of 10-year notes today and
will sell $13 billion of 30-year securities tomorrow.  Germany sold 4.18 billion euros of 2.25 percent 10-year
