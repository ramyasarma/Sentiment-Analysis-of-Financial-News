Australia is examining ways to issue
infrastructure bonds, including offering investors a tax break,
to tap private sector capital and help clear an investment
backlog of more than A$450 billion, the Australian Financial
Review reported, without saying where it got the information. If
bonds were issued today, investors could expect to receive a
tax-free yield of about 8 percent, the newspaper said, citing an
unnamed analyst.  To contact the reporter on this story:
