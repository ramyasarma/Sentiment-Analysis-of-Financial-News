Whistler Blackcomb Holdings Inc.,
owner of the Canadian ski resort that hosted the 2010 Winter
Olympics, will seek to raise at least C$300 million ($299
million) in an initial public offering, according to two people
familiar with the sale.  The company will sell a stake as early as this month to
repay debt owed to Intrawest ULC, the selling shareholder and a
unit of New York-based buyout firm  Fortress Investment Group
LLC , according to the people, who declined to be named because
the details aren’t public. Whistler Blackcomb will list shares
on the  Toronto Stock Exchange  and pay a quarterly dividend,
according to an Oct. 8 filing with Canadian regulators.  The sale is led by CIBC World Markets, RBC Dominion
Securities and eight other investment banks, which have the
option to sell another 15 percent of the offering after the deal
closes, raising proceeds to about C$345 million. Terms of the
sale weren’t disclosed in the filing.  Fortress Investment, run by  Daniel Mudd , agreed to buy
Intrawest Corp. in August 2006 for about $2.8 billion including
$950 million in debt. Intrawest’s ski resorts include Whistler
Blackcomb, Mont Tremblant near Montreal, and Steamboat in
Colorado.  Whistler Blackcomb, North America’s largest ski resort, is
located about 125 kilometers (78 miles) north of Vancouver.
