Soybean imports by China, the
world’s biggest buyer, declined for a third month in September
as buyers boosted purchases of domestic beans, according to data
from the Beijing-based customs agency.  Imports  were 4.64 million metric tons, customs said in a
 statement  on its website. August shipments were 4.77 million
tons, while purchases in June were a record 6.2 million tons,
Bloomberg data show. Monthly imports normally decline as China’s
domestic harvest comes onto the market, said analyst Chen Baomin
of Jilin Grain Group Co.  China’s soybean imports for 2009-2010 marketing year ended
Sept. 30 were 50.4 million tons, according to calculations by
Bloomberg. Monthly imports will still likely average more than
4.5 million in the year started Oct. 1, Chen said from Dalian.  “Crushers in northern China usually scale back imports
during this time of year as they switch to domestic beans, but
this is still a relatively large number,” Chen said. “Crushers
in the south will continue to import.”  September’s import figures are “largely as expected,”
analyst Wang Wenfei at Wanda Futures Co. said by phone from
Beijing. “To meet the forecast by the USDA for this year means
inbound shipments will need to be sustained at this level.”  China may import 55 million tons of soybeans in the
2010-2011 marketing year, a gain of 8.9 percent from the
previous year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast Oct.
8. Inbound shipments in 2009-2010 grew 23 percent from the
previous year, the USDA’s data show.  Fourth-quarter imports by China may rise by 3.6 million
tons from a year ago to 13.8 million tons, the China National
Grain & Oils Information Center said in an e-mail today.
Crushers are actively seeking shipments between March and July,
spurred by rising profits, it said.  September imports of vegetable oils and natural rubber were
640,000 tons and 190,000 tons respectively, according to the
customs statement released today.  -- William Bi . Editors: Matthew Oakley, Richard Dobson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
