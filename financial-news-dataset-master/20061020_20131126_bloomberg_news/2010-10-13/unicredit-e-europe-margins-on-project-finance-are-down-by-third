UniCredit SpA ’s margins for project
finance in central and eastern Europe have narrowed by about
one-third because of increasing competition, according to
Massimo Pecorari, co-head of project and commodity finance at
the Italian bank’s Financing and Advisory unit.  “We are seeing very high competition among banks these
days in central and eastern Europe,” Pecorari told reporters in
Vienna today. Margins “are under pressure,” and that may
continue into 2011, he said.  Project finance, in which a private enterprise creates
an entity to fund and build a public asset under a government
contract, is getting more competitive in central and eastern
Europe as states cut back on infrastructure projects and focus
on trimming deficits. Government contracts were a lucrative and
reliable area for lenders during the credit crunch and banks are
now investing heavily in project finance, Pecorari said.  With project financing, “banks had a very good, positive
experience during the crisis, all portfolios performed very
well,” the executive said. Even with lower margins, “it is a
very good business. Final fees are much higher” in project
finance than in other corporate business, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
