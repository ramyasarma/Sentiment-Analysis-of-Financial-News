OfficeMax Inc. , the third-largest
U.S. office-supply chain, said it hired  Ravichandra Saligram , a
former president at Aramark Corp., as chief executive officer.  Saligram, 54, will replace  Sam Duncan  on Nov. 8,
Naperville, Illinois-based OfficeMax said today in a statement.
Duncan, who announced his retirement earlier this year, will
remain as an adviser through February.  Rakesh Gangwal  will move
from director to chairman of the board to replace Duncan, the
company said.  OfficeMax has been closing stores and cutting costs during
the past four years as it faces mounting competition from
discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp.
The retailer announced a five-year plan to increase revenue in
February that calls for selling more computer services and
catering to women.  OfficeMax rose 34 cents to $16.03 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have advanced 26
percent this year.  Saligram also worked for  InterContinental Hotels Group  and
S.C. Johnson & Son Inc. He serves as board member for Church &
Dwight Co., which manufactures Arm & Hammer-branded products.  Total revenue in the quarter from July to September will be
“slightly lower” than the $1.83 billion generated in the same
period a year earlier, OfficeMax said in a Sept. 14 statement.
Revenue from U.S. stores open at least a year was also expected
to decline, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
