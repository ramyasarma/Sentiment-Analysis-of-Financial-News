Porsche SE , the maker of the 911
sports car, forecast its first profit in three years in 2011 on
sales of the Panamera sedan and as costs linked to a merger with
 Volkswagen AG  decline.  Porsche, which will switch to  calendar-year  reporting next
year, said it aims to break even in the last five months of
2010. The  net loss  in the 12 months ended July 31 narrowed to
454 million euros ($633 million) from a loss of 3.56 billion
euros a year earlier, the Stuttgart, Germany-based company said
today in a statement.  Matthias Mueller , who took the helm of Porsche’s carmaking
operations last month, is tasked with completing Porsche’s
merger with VW next year and expanding models across four
vehicle lines to double annual sales to 150,000 cars and sport-
utility vehicles by 2014.  VW  acquired 49.9 percent of the
Porsche AG operating unit after Porsche last year failed in a
hostile takeover attempt for Europe’s largest carmaker.  “Improving vehicle sales, especially the Panamera and
Cayenne models, will be the driving force in Porsche’s campaign
to return to profit,” said  Frank Schwope , an analyst at NordLB
in Hanover, Germany, who recommends holding the stock. Porsche
deliveries may approach 100,000 in 2011 compared with about
81,850 in the 12 months through July, he said.  Shares Jump  The preferred  stock  rose 1.84 euros, or 5 percent, to 39.00
euros, the steepest jump in almost 3 months, in Frankfurt. The
common stock is 90 percent-controlled by the founding Porsche
and Piech families and 10 percent by the emirate of Qatar.  Porsche will pay a dividend of 10 cents per preferred
share, which don’t carry voting rights, compared with 5 cents.  Mueller, 57, was appointed today to the management board of
the Porsche SE holding company in charge of products and
technology.  Full-year  revenue , reported last month, jumped 18 percent
to a record 7.79 billion euros, while deliveries including the
$106,000 Panamera sedan and Porsche’s best-selling model, the
Cayenne SUV, rose 8.8 percent to 81,850 vehicles.  Operating income in the carmaking business reached 1.19
billion euros and the pretax profit margin was 16 percent,
Porsche said today, without giving comparison figures.  Porsche  remains exposed to “considerable risks” stemming
from unresolved U.S. lawsuits filed by VW stock short sellers
who claim the carmaker secretly cornered the market in VW shares
and inflicted more than $1 billion in losses, Schwope said.  Merger Delay  Volkswagen may delay the merger until the hedge fund
lawsuits and German tax issues are resolved,  Max Warburton , an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London, said in a report
today.  Porsche has said a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier
this year limiting foreign investors’ ability to sue companies
based abroad in U.S. courts will help fight U.S.-based suits.  VW CEO  Martin Winterkorn  said on Sept. 29 that integration
of Porsche is “in full swing” and will be completed as planned
next year.  At the Paris Motor Show this month, Porsche presented the
new $282,000 911 Speedster. The sports-car maker in July
approved the production of the 918 Spyder hybrid, a sports-car
that may be priced at about 500,000 euros.  Winterkorn, VW Chief Financial Officer  Hans Dieter Poetsch 
and Mueller will hold a press conference in Stuttgart Oct. 19 to
discuss the results. Porsche shareholders will meet Nov. 30 to
vote on a  capital increase  of about 5 billion euros to take
place the first half of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
