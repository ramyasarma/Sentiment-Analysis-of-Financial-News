Commerzbank AG , Germany’s second-
biggest bank, may need more capital as it is being added to the
Financial Stability Board’s list of systemically important
banks,  Handelsblatt  said, without saying where it got the
information.  The FSB, which coordinates the work of national financial
regulators on an international level, requires lenders on the
list to hold an additional capital buffer, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
