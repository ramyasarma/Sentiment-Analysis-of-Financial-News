Cummins Inc., VMware Inc. and
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. show that stock pickers can still
outperform the market even as shares move in the same direction
as benchmark indexes at near record rates, according to  Birinyi
Associates Inc.   The Westport, Connecticut-based research firm identified 15
stocks in the  Russell 3000 Index  that, on average, outperformed
the index by 70 percentage points this year while moving in the
same direction as the gauge 58 percent of the time.  Since climbing to a record 72 percent on July 16, the
correlation between the  Russell 3000  and its stocks has remained
near that level, Birinyi data show, with the gauge’s companies
moving together with the index 63 percent of the time over the
past 50 days. That’s almost twice the average of 32 percent over
the past 30 years. Currently, 95 percent of Russell 3000 stocks
have a 50-day correlation coefficient greater than the
historical average.  Picking individual stocks is still “the key to equity
investing” despite the rising correlations, Birinyi’s report
said. The Russell 3000 rose 5.9 percent in 2010 through
yesterday, trailing gains in Cummins, VMware and Chipotle by at
least 91 percentage points.  ‘Home-Run’ Stocks  “Now that we know most stocks do the same thing every day,
does that mean we should just throw in the towel?”  Cleve Rueckert , analyst at Birinyi, wrote in a note to clients dated
yesterday. “While the vast majority of stocks are acting as one
group, there are still many examples of the so-called ‘home-
run,’ and finding one or two of them will generate significant
performance for your portfolio.”  Cummins  is 83 percent correlated with the Russell 3000, the
highest within the group selected by Birinyi. The Columbus,
Indiana-based maker of diesel truck engines and generators
outperformed the equity gauge by 94 percentage points in 2010,
according to the firm’s data.  VMware, the business-software maker based in Palo Alto,
Calif., has a 64 percent correlation and has beaten the Russell
3000 by 97 percentage points. Chipotle, the Denver-based Mexican
restaurant chain, has a 67 percent correlation and has
outperformed the Russell 3000 by 92 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
