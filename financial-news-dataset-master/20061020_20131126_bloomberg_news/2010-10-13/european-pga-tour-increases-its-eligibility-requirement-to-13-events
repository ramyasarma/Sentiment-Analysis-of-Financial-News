The European PGA Tour has raised the
number of tournaments golfers must play for full membership for
the second consecutive year.  The tour’s  Tournament Committee  today announced in a
statement that players will have to participate in 13 events
next season to be considered a full member. The number was
raised to 12 from 11 for the 2010 season.  Full members are eligible to win the Race to Dubai, the
European Tour’s season-long money list, as well as the tour’s
player of the year award. They are also eligible to qualify for
the Ryder Cup through the European points list.  England’s  Paul Casey  and  Justin Rose  both missed out on
this month’s Ryder Cup after they failed to reach the minimum
requirement because they played the U.S. PGA Tour. The two were
then not among captain  Colin Montgomerie ’s three wild-card
selections, even though they are ranked among the top 12
Europeans in the Official World Golf Ranking.  The tour also said the Volvo World Match Play Championship,
which in 2011 will be played at Finca Cortesin Hotel, Golf & Spa
in Spain from May 19-22, will be deemed to be one of the 13
counting events. The event wasn’t played this year after
switching to a spring slot from its former traditional autumn
date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
