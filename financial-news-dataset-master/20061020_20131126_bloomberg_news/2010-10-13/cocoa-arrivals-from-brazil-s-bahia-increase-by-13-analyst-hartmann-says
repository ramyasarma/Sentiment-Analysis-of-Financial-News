Cocoa arrivals from Bahia, Brazil’s
biggest growing region, advanced 13 percent in the week to Oct.
10 as farm-gate prices improved, analyst  Thomas Hartmann  said.  Arrivals were 47,453 bags compared with 42,063 bags a week
earlier, according to an e-mailed report from the Salvador,
Brazil-based analyst dated yesterday. Total arrivals from Brazil
for the week climbed to 60,600 bags from 56,253 bags. Bahia
accounts for at least 70 percent of the country’s output,
according to Hartmann. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  “Arrivals from all regions progressed as expected, with a
gradual increase from Bahia and an equally measured decline from
the other states,” Hartmann wrote in the report. Farm-gate
prices ranged from $3,005 to $3,145 a metric ton, about 2.6
percent to 2.7 percent higher than the week earlier, he said.  Hartmann is a board member of the Commercial Association of
Bahia, and in charge of the group’s statistical service on
Brazilian cocoa output, according to a Sept. 2 e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
