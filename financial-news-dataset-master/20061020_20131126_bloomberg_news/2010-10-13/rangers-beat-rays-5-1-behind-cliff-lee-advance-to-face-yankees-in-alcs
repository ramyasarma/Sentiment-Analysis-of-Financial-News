Cliff Lee remained undefeated in
postseason play as the Texas Rangers beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-1
to advance to the American League Championship Series against
the New York Yankees.   Lee pitched a six-hitter with 11 strikeouts at Tropicana
Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, to win the deciding fifth game
of the AL Division Series and improve to 6-0 in his seven career
Major League Baseball postseason starts.   Ian Kinsler had three hits, including a two-run home run
for the Rangers, who were the only current major-league
franchise to not win a postseason series. Texas next faces the
Yankees in the best-of-seven ALCS starting Oct. 15.   This was the first postseason series in major league
history in which the road team won every game. Texas won the
first two games at Tropicana Field and then lost two in a row at
home before tonight’s victory.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
