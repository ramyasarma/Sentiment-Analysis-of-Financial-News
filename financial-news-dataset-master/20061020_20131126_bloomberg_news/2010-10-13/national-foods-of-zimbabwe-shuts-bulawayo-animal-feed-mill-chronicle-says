National Foods Ltd.  of Zimbabwe will
next month put its animal-feeds mill in Bulawayo on “care and
maintenance” because it can’t source the necessary ingredients,
the  Chronicle  reported, citing a company statement.  National Foods closed its Bulawayo flour mill last month,
leading to a shortage of wheat bran in the city, the newspaper
said. Mills and feed plants in the capital, Harare, will now
supply agricultural retailers in Bulawayo, the Chronicle said.  National Foods is majority-owned by Zimbabwe-listed  Innscor
Ltd. , which operates feed mills, retail outlets, a pig abattoir,
a crocodile farm and fast-food outlets in several African
countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
