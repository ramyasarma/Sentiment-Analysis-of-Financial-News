Holdings of the  100 largest  U.S.
public-employee retirement systems rose 6.8 percent for the 12
months through June, the first fiscal-year gain since 2007, a
 U.S. Census Bureau  report shows.  The state and local government funds held $2.35 trillion as
of June 30, up from $2.2 trillion a year earlier. They remain
below their peak value of $2.93 trillion at the end of 2007, the
Census Bureau said in a report released on its website today.  Benefits  paid from the funds, which account for about 89
percent of financial activity among all public retirement funds,
totaled about $176 billion, a 7.8 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to the report.  The funds lost a total of $58.6 billion on their
investments during the second quarter, the most since the final
three months of 2008, according to the report.  Domestic  corporate stocks  performed worst of all asset
classes during the quarter, losing 13.6 percent from the prior
three months, according to the report. Mortgages, which rose 5.5
percent, and federal government securities, with a 1.7 percent
increase, were the only asset classes to post gains, according
to the Census Bureau.  U.S. stocks were the largest holdings among the funds,
composing about 31 percent of assets, the report said.  Of the 50 state retirement systems, fewer than half had
assets to pay for 80 percent of promised benefits in their 2009
fiscal years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mounting pension liabilities threaten “the ability of
state and local governments to operate,” economists  Joshua Rauh 
of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University
and  Robert Novy-Marx  of the University of Rochester wrote in a
study of city and county retirement systems released Oct. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
