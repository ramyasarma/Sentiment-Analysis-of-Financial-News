Mubadala Development Co., an
investment unit of the Abu Dhabi government, raised its oil and
natural gas output 14.3 percent, driven by growth in Bahrain.  Production is at 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day,
up from 350,000 a year earlier, Maurizio la Noce, chief
executive officer of Mubadala’s oil unit, said today at the Oil
& Money conference in London.  Mubadala, Occidental Petroleum Corp. and National Oil & Gas
Authority of Bahrain in November last year agreed to develop the
Bahrain oilfield. The venture plans to boost gas output capacity
at the field to about 2.7 billion cubic feet a day from 1.3
billion cubic feet, Bahrain’s Energy Minister  Abdul Hussain Mirza  said in May.  Mubadala started drilling for oil and gas in the Caspian
Sea at Kazakhstan’s Block-N three weeks ago, where it’s
exploring with Houston-based ConocoPhillips, la Noce said. The
company is interested in exploration in the Turkmen area of the
Caspian, la Noce said. He declined to comment on whether the
company is interested in buying assets from BP Plc.  ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Officer  Jim Mulva  said at a
conference on Sept. 15 that the venture’s drilling in the
Caspian has a good chance of finding hydrocarbons.  “We feel that we’re in a providence of known hydrocarbons,
very large feature, because in the early 1980s, the Soviets
drilled a well and unfortunately had to kick a blow-out,” Mulva
said, according to a transcript of the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
