Fresnillo Plc , the world’s largest
primary silver producer, rose the most in six weeks in London
trading after third-quarter output climbed to a record.  Fresnillo  advanced 3.3 percent, the steepest gain since
Aug. 26. So-called attributable production rose to 10.69 million
ounces from 10.57 million ounces a year earlier, the Mexico
City-based company said in a statement today. Gold output jumped
44 percent to 91,822 ounces.  The company “remains confident” of achieving its full-
year production target of 41.1 million ounces of silver, it
said. Fresnillo expects to “slightly beat” annual output
forecasts for both metals, Head of Investor Relations  Arturo Espinola  said.  The target includes 3 million ounces of silver from the
Silverstream agreement, an accord between Fresnillo and Mexico’s
Industrias Penoles SAB. The company sees nothing in the “short
term” to cause a decline in silver prices, Espinola said on a
conference call.  Fresnillo  closed 41 pence higher at 1,282 pence at the 4:30
p.m. close of trade in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
