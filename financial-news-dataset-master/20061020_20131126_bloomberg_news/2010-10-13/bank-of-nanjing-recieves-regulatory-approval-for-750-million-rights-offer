Bank of Nanjing Co. , part-owned
by BNP Paribas SA, won the final regulatory approval for a
plan to raise as much as 5 billion yuan ($750 million) to
replenish capital.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission approved
the rights offer today, according to a statement on the
regulator’s Web site.  Nanjing Bank, based in eastern Jiangsu province, said
in December it will offer 2.5 shares for every 10 held in
the rights offer after expanding loans by 67 percent last
year, the fastest among the nation’s  publicly traded
lenders . The lender’s three biggest shareholders including
 BNP Paribas  have all agreed to participate in the offering.  Bank of Nanjing rose 5.2 percent today to close at
11.90 yuan in Shanghai trading.  -- Luo Jun ,  Yidi Zhao . Editor:  Tan Hwee Ann   To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
