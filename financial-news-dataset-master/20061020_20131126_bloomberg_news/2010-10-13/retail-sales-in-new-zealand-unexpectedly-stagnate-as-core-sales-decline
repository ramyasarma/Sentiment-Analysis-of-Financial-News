New Zealand retail sales were
unchanged in August, while so-called core sales fell for a
second month, adding to the case for the central bank to keep
interest rates unchanged for the rest of the year.  Retail sales were expected to rise 0.3 percent, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 11
economists. Core sales, which exclude fuel outlets, auto dealers
and workshops, declined 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
