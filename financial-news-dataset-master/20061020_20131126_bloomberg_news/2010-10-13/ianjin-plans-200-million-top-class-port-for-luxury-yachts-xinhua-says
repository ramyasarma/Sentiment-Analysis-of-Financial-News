Tianjin in northern China will build
a 1.3 billion yuan “top-class” port for yachts by year-end,
Xinhua News Agency said, citing Yang Shihao, a deputy head of
the city’s Binhai district.  The port will cover an area of 900,000 square meters and
have 750 berths able to accomodate yachts as big as 300 feet in
length, Xinhua said. Five-star hotels and yacht manufacturing
and repair facilities will be set up in the area, it said.  The yacht club will limit membership to people with
salaries of at least 200,000 yuan a year, with people who intend
to buy a yacht required to have annual incomes of more than 2
million yuan, the news agency said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
