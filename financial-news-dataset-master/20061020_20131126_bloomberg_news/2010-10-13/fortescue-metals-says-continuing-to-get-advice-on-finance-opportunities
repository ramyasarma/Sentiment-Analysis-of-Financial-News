Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. ,
Australia’s third-largest iron ore producer, is continuing to
receive advice from advisers on finance opportunities after
signing a $2.04 billion loan agreement.  The company “will inform the market if and when any formal
decisions are made” on the advice, Perth-based Fortescue said
today in a statement. It may sell $6 billion of bonds to fund
expansion, the Australian Financial Review reported today in its
Street Talk column, without citing anyone.  The $2.04 billion loan, with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, will replace project-based notes,
Fortescue said on Oct. 10. The company, which last year failed
to agree terms for as much as $6 billion in funding from China,
has outlined plans to expand production to 355 million metric
tons, from 40 million metric tons.  Fortescue  rose 5 percent to A$6.30 at the 4:10 p.m. Sydney
time on the Australian stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
