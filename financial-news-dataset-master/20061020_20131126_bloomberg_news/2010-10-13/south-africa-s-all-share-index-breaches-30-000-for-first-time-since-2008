South Africa’s broadest stocks
measure breached the 30,000 level for the first time since July
2008 as speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease monetary
policy further boosted the appeal of emerging market assets.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  advanced 1.6 percent to
30,267.46 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. Gains were led by
mining companies Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Plc as well
as  SABMiller Plc , the world’s second-largest brewer by volume.  U.S. policy makers were prepared to ease monetary policy
“before long,” purchase more Treasury securities and boost
inflation expectations to stimulate the economy, according to
the minutes of the Sept. 21 meeting released yesterday. Weaker-
than-forecast U.S. job growth in September has increased
speculation that the nation’s central bank will soon start a
second wave of unconventional monetary easing.  “Many people see a 30,000 break as quite a significant
technical level,” said Priniel Gungudoo, an equity portfolio
manager at Johannesburg-based  Standard Bank Group Ltd. , Africa’s
biggest lender. “We’re seeing this spike because of the minutes
released by the Fed last night which suggest quantitative easing
will be prolonged.”  A sluggish recovery from the U.S.’s worst recession since
the 1930s may prompt the Fed to step up purchases of government
debt, a process known as quantitative easing, while at the same
time keeping interest rates at near-zero levels. Benchmark rates
of 0.1 percent in Japan and 0.25 percent in the U.S. have
encouraged investors to borrow cheaply and invest in markets
offering higher returns.  The strategy, known as the carry trade, has prompted a 37
percent rally in the rand versus the dollar since the start of
2009 while the benchmark stock index has gained almost 22
percent. South Africa’s central bank  rate  is at 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
