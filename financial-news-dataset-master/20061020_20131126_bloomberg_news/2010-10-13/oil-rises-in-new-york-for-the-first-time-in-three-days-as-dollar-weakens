 Oil rose for the first time in
three days as the dollar extended losses, bolstering the appeal
of commodities as a hedge against inflation.  Crude for November delivery climbed as much as 38 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $82.05 a barrel in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures are up 3.4 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
