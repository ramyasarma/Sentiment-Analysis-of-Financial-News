Venezuela will boost the amount of
debt it can sell next year by 53 percent and increase its annual
budget by 28 percent, Venezuelan Vice President  Elias Jaua  said
today in comments carried by state television.  The executive cabinet’s proposed debt law for 2011 will
rise to 54 billion bolivars ($12.6 billion) from 35.2 billion
last year, Jaua said.  The 2011 budget proposal calls for 204.2 billion bolivars
in spending, a 28 percent increase from 2010, Jaua said. The
government will present the budget and debt laws to the National
Assembly Oct. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
