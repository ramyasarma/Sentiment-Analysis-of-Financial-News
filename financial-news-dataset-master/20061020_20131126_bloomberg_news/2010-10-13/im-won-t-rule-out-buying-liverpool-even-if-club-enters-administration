Singapore billionaire Peter Lim said
he would not rule out buying Premier League soccer club
Liverpool even if it is placed into administration.  Lim has offered 320 million pounds ($507 million) to buy
the club, trumping an accepted offer from the Boston Red Sox
ownership group.  “He feels strongly the board did not give him a fair
opportunity to put his best offer forward,” David Shriver, a
spokesman for Lim, said in an e-mail today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
