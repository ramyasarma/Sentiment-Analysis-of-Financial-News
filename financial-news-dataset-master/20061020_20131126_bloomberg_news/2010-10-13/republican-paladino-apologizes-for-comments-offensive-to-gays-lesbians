Republican  Carl Paladino , a
candidate for  New York  governor, apologized for comments he made
“that may have offended the gay and lesbian community.”  “Any reference to branding an entire community based on a
small representation of them is wrong,” Paladino, 64, said
today in an e-mailed statement. “I ask you for forgiveness on
my poorly chosen words,” the Buffalo property developer said.  “I just think my children and your children would be much
better off and much more successful getting married and raising
a family, and I don’t want them brainwashed into thinking that
homosexuality is an equally valid and successful option -- it
isn’t,” Paladino said in an Oct. 10 speech to orthodox Jews,
according to the New York Times. Yesterday, he said that while
he supported equal rights he doesn’t believe that children
should be exposed to events such as gay-pride parades.  “They wear these little Speedos and they grind against
each other and it’s just a terrible thing,” Paladino said
yesterday on NBC’s “Today” show, according to a transcript.
“Why would you bring your children to that?”  Paladino, a Tea Party supporter, has seen his opponent,
Democrat  Andrew Cuomo , 52, widen a lead in surveys heading up to
the Nov. 2 vote.  A Quinnipiac University poll last week showed Paladino
trailing Cuomo, the state attorney general, by 18 percentage
points. Likely voters supported the Democrat 55 percent to
Paladino’s 37 percent. In a Sept. 22 survey, Cuomo led 49
percent to 43 percent.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
