China has “basically completed” an
investigation into loans taken by the financing vehicles of
local governments and discovered “problems” with about 2
trillion yuan of the loans, the China Securities Journal
reported today, citing an unidentified person.  There was 7.66 trillion yuan of outstanding loans taken by
these financing vehicles as of the end of June, the newspaper
reported. There is “serious risk” for the repayment of about
26 percent of that debt, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
