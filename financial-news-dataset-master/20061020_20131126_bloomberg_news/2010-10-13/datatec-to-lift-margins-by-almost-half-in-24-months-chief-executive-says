Datatec Ltd. , a networking
technology and computer services company, predicted earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will jump
as a percentage of sales within two years.  “Our gross margins are always going to be in the 13
percent to 14 percent zone, but our Ebitda margins should be
headed to 4 percent” from 2.7 percent in the next 18 to 24
months, Chief Executive Officer  Jens Montanana  said in a phone
interview today, speaking from Johannesburg where the company
is based.  Datatec said in October last year that it had cut its
workforce by 8 percent in 12 months to reduce costs amid
slowing sales caused by the global recession. The reduced
overheads will benefit the company over the next few years,
Montanana said today.  Increasing  margins  “from 2.7 percent to 4 percent might
not sound like too much but on $4 billion to $5 billion revenue
that is a big number if we can get that leverage to come
through,” Montanana said.  Datatec has about $150 million to make  acquisitions .
Brazil is “the most prominent” market for Datatec’s growth
aspirations, Montanana said. “Brazil is definitely an area for
acquisitions,” he said. “We are looking at a number of
acquisitions in South America and Southeast Asia.”  Net income rose to $16.1 million in the six months ended
Aug. 31 from $8.5 million a year earlier, the company said in a
statement today. Sales rose 19 percent to $2.13 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
