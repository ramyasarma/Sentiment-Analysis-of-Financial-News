Posco , the world’s third-largest
steelmaker by production, fell the most in more than two months
in Seoul trading after it cut full-year profit forecast by 7
percent.  Posco , ranked after ArcelorMittal and China’s Baosteel
Group Corp. by the World Steel Association, dropped 4.1 percent
to close at 498,000 won on the Korea Exchange, the biggest loss
since July 30. The benchmark  Kospi index  rose 0.4 percent. Local
rival  Hyundai Steel Co.  fell 3.4 percent, the biggest drop since
Sept. 16, and  Nippon Steel Corp ., Japan’s biggest, retreated 1.5
percent to 270 yen, the lowest price since April 1 last year.  “Posco shares seem to be reacting to the weaker-than-
expected earnings and, more importantly, to the lowered profit
forecast,” said Chung Ji Yun, a basic materials analyst with HI
Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “The shares may be
weighed on by the results for the time being.”  Operating profit  will probably be 5.2 trillion won ($4.7
billion) for the 12 months ending Dec. 31, compared with its
earlier forecast of 5.6 trillion won, the Pohang-based company
said yesterday after reporting the first decline in net income
in four quarters.  Net income dropped to 1.04 trillion won in the three months
ended Sept. 30, from 1.14 trillion won a year earlier, Posco
said yesterday. That fell short of the 1.13 trillion won average
of 14  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  HI Investment’s Chung today cut her six-month price
estimate for the stock to 600,000 won from 650,000 won.  The shares have fallen 19 percent this year,
underperforming a 12 percent advance in the Kospi on concern
that investors may be unable to pass on increased costs to
customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
