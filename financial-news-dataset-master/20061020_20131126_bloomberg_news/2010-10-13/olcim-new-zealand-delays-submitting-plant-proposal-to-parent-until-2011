The New Zealand branch of  Holcim
Ltd. , the world’s second-biggest cement maker, has delayed
submitting a proposal for a new plant after reviewing cost
estimates.  The proposal to the unit’s Swiss parent will be made early
next year,  Holcim New Zealand Ltd.  said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Holcim makes about half of New Zealand’s cement and has
been considering the project near  Oamaru  on the nation’s South
Island since 2006 to replace its aging Westport plant. The
company received planning approval in August last year for the
880,000 metric ton-a-year plant that was expected in 2008 to
cost NZ$500 million ($378 million), including new port
infrastructure and ships.  “The need to allow extra time for suppliers to provide up-
to-date capital cost information has impacted on the project’s
timeline,”  Ken Cowie , Holcim New Zealand’s capital projects
manager said. A final decision by the group will reflect other
international investments Holcim is considering, availability of
capital and New Zealand government policy, he said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
