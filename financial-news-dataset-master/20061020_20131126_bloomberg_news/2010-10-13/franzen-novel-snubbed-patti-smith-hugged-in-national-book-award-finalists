This year’s National Book Award
finalists don’t include Jonathan Franzen, bestselling author of
the widely praised, Oprah’s Book Club-endorsed novel, “Freedom.”  Among the fiction finalists is Peter Carey’s “Parrot and
Olivier in America,” which was on the short list for the Man
Booker Prize but lost to Howard Jacobson’s “The Finkler
Question” last night. Others are Lionel Shriver’s “So Much for
That,” the story of a man bled dry by his health-insurance
company as his wife dies of cancer, and Nicole Krauss’s “Great
House.”  The finalists for the nonfiction prize include  Patti Smith ’s memoir, “Just Kids,” and  Barbara Demick ’s “Nothing to
Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea.”  In a year that saw the publication of many notable books
about the financial crisis, including Joseph E. Stiglitz’s
“Freefall” and Michael Lewis’s “The Big Short,” no business
books received nominations.  The winners will be announced on Nov. 17 in New York at a
benefit for the National Book Foundation hosted by comedian and
writer  Andy Borowitz .  Tom Wolfe  will receive an award for Distinguished
Contribution to American Letters. Joan Ganz Cooney, a creator of
“Sesame Street,” will receive the Literarian Award for
Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community.
