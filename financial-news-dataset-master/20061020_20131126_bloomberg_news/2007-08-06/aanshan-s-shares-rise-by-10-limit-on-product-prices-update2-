             Maanshan Iron & Steel (600808)  Co., one of
 China 's biggest producers of construction steel, led a gain in
the nation's steel stocks, advancing by the 10 percent daily
limit on speculation higher prices will boost profit.  
 Maanshan's yuan-denominated stock rose 0.82 yuan to close
at 9.06 yuan on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the highest closing
since May 29. The price of so-called reinforcement bars, known
as rebars and used in buildings, rose to the highest in more
than two years.  
 China has encouraged steelmakers to shift output into
sheets and plates, used in automobiles and appliances, to curb a
domestic glut of rebars. The slower expansion of construction
steel output led to its prices rising faster than those of so-
called flat products, analysts including Lin Hai said.  
 ``Maanshan Steel outpaces its peers partly because of the
stronger rebar prices,'' said Lin, a Shanghai-based steel
analyst with Guotai Asset Management Co., which oversees $1.8
billion worth of assets.  
 Among other companies, stock in Baoshan Iron & Steel Co.,
China's biggest mill, rose 6.5 percent to close at 14.88  yuan ,
while Wuhan Iron & Steel Co. gained 8.1 percent to 14.49 yuan.  
 The price of rebars has gained 20 percent this year to
3,674 yuan ($486) a ton, beating the 2.8 percent increase in the
price of hot-rolled sheets, according to research firm Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co. That is the highest price
for rebars since April 6, 2005.  
 Maanshan Steel's new cold-rolling plant will also open
later this year, making as much as 5 million tons of steel
sheets annually, analysts including Antaike's Ma Haitian said.
