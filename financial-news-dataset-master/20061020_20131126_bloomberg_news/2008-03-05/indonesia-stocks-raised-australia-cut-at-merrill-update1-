             Indonesia's  stock market  was raised
to ``overweight'' by Merrill Lynch & Co. as the country will
benefit from high commodity prices, while  Australia (AS51)  was cut to
``underweight'' on rising  interest rates .  
 Commodity exports will help Indonesia withstand a U.S.
slowdown while economic growth in the Southeast Asian nation's
resource-rich islands may accelerate, Merrill Lynch said in a
report dated today. Rising interest rates will ``hit consumer and
banking stocks'' in Australia, it said.  
 ``People will continue to go into commodities,'' said
Merrill Lynch's Hong Kong-based analyst  Mark Matthews  in the
report. ``Robust growth and rising commodity prices are a major
boon for earnings.''  
 Indonesia's economy expanded at its fastest pace in a decade
last year helped by declining interest rates, which have fallen
to a three-year low. The country is also a producer of coal and
crude palm oil, both prices of which have risen to records.  PT
Bumi Resources (BUMI) , the nation's second-biggest company by market
value, is Asia's largest thermal coal exporter.  
 ``Demand for coal from China and India is accelerating and
transport infrastructure bottlenecks in Australia is forcing up
coal prices,'' Matthews said.  
 Among the companies favored by Merrill are  PT Tambang
Batubara Bukit Asam (PTBA) , an Indonesian coal miner, PT International
Nickel Indonesia and  PT United Tractors (UNTR) , a heavy equipment seller.  
 Meanwhile Australia shows signs of overheating as production
capacity constraints are starting to show up in inflation which
could further drive up interest rates, Matthews said.  
 ``For an interest-rate sensitive market, Australian stocks
in general are going to find it difficult to outperform the
region,'' he said. ``Australia offers little growth potential.''  
 Among the least preferred stocks is  Wesfarmers Ltd. (WESDA)  as it
struggles to turn around its supermarket business, he said.  
 Australia's S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.1 percent to 5,376.60
at the close, and the Jakarta Composite Index dropped 0.8 percent
to 2,614.88 at the midday break.
