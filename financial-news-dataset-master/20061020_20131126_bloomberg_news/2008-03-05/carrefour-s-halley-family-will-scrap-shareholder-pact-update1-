             The Halley family will dissolve a
shareholder pact that gives them control of more than 10 percent
of  Carrefour SA (CA) , Europe's biggest retailer, through holdings of
Comet BV and Halley Participations SAS.  
 ``Members of the Halley family have unanimously decided to
change their shareholding structure in Carrefour,'' Halley
Participations and Comet BV said in an e-mailed statement today.
The accord will end after a shareholders meeting on April 15.  
 Halley family members reaffirmed their ``strong
attachment'' to Carrefour, which is based outside Paris, and
their confidence in Chief Executive Officer Jose Luis Duran, the
statement said.  
 Billionaire  Bernard Arnault 's Arnault Groupe and buyout
firm  Colony Capital LLC , said they will become Carrefour's
biggest shareholder through their holding Blue Capital.  
 Blue Capital will ``fully take on its role'' as Carrefour's
leading shareholder, it said in a separate statement, adding
that its holding is a ``strategic'' investment and that it
trusts Carrefour's management to ``exploit the group's ability
to create value.''
