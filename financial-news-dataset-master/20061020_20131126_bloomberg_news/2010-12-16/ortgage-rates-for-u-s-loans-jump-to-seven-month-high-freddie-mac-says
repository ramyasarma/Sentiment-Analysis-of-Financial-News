Mortgage rates for 30-year U.S.
loans jumped to a seven-month high, increasing borrowing costs
for homebuyers as the real estate industry struggles to recover.  The average rate for a 30-year  fixed loan  rose to 4.83
percent in the week ended today from 4.61 percent, Freddie Mac
said in a statement. The average 15-year  rate  increased to 4.17
percent from 3.96 percent, the mortgage-finance company said.  Borrowing costs have climbed for five straight weeks since
hitting a record low last month. Mortgage rates are tracking a
surge in bond yields amid a Federal Reserve plan to buy $600
billion of debt and speculation that President Barack Obama’s
agreement to extend tax cuts will bolster growth and inflation.  “Market concerns over stronger economic growth that, in the
near term, could lead to an increase in inflation have sparked a
rise in bond yields and mortgage rates have followed,”  Frank Nothaft , vice president and chief economist of McLean, Virginia-
based Freddie Mac, said in the statement.  Mortgage applications in the U.S. fell for a third straight
week as rising borrowing costs discouraged purchases and
refinancing, the Mortgage Bankers Association said yesterday.
The Washington-based group’s applications  index  declined 2.3
percent in the week ended Dec. 10. Purchases slid 5 percent,
while the  refinancing  gauge decreased 0.7 percent.  Housing demand, which slowed with the expiration of a
federal homebuyer tax credit in April, is being weighed down by
unemployment near 10 percent and a deepening foreclosure crisis.
The five-week rise in the 30-year rate has pushed the monthly
cost of a $300,000 loan to $1,579 from $1,462.  New home construction remains near a record low. Housing
starts in November rose to a 555,000 annual rate, up 3.9 percent
from October, the Commerce Department reported today. Starts
reached a pace of 2.27 million in January 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
