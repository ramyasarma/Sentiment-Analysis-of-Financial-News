Thirty Iraqi, Iranian and Kurdish
asylum seekers are confirmed dead after their wooden boat bound
for Australia sank in heavy seas close to Christmas Island.  There were 42 survivors from the crash two days ago and the
total number of passengers on the boat is unclear, a customs
statement said. Prime Minister  Julia Gillard , who returned from
leave after the incident, warned yesterday that more bodies
would be found.  About 145 Australian customs, police and medical officers
will today continue the search and salvage operation, the
government  said  in a statement. An identification unit has been
established for the victims and there will a coronial inquest.  A total of 353 people drowned in 2001 during a bid to reach
Australia when the 19-meter Siev-X sank in waters south of
Indonesia with only 44 survivors.  Christmas Island, about 1,600 miles (2,600 kilometers)
northwest of Perth, houses a center for people claiming refugee
status. Almost 6,400 asylum seekers from countries including
Iraq and Sri Lanka have arrived by boat in Australia this year,
up from 2,726 in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
