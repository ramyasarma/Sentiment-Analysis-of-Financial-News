The International Monetary Fund’s
board today approved a three-year, 22.5 billion-euro loan
facility for Ireland, the Washington-based fund said in a
statement.  The IMF aid, which the fund says is equivalent to $30.1
billion, is part of an 85 billion euro rescue package put
together by the IMF and European authorities. Today’s action
makes 5.8 billion euros available to Ireland immediately.  “The Irish economy faces a crisis without parallel in its
recent history,” said IMF Managing Director  Dominique Strauss- Kahn  in a statement. The Washington-based IMF said a
“critically weakened” banking sector is at the root of
Ireland’s problems.  Ireland’s parliament approved the bailout by a vote of 81
to 75 yesterday. The parliament also voted to back new banking
laws proposed by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
