Crude oil fell from a one-week high
on concern that warmer weather in the U.S. may reduce heating
oil demand in the coming week.  Oil pared yesterday’s gains after the Energy Department
said stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, increased 1.09 million barrels to 161.3
million. Normal or warmer-than-normal weather is likely in most
of the Northeast and Midwest from Dec. 25 to Dec. 29, according
to Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda, Maryland.  Crude for January delivery fell as much as 57 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $88.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
