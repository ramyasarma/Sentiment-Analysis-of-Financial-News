Manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region expanded in December at the fastest pace since April 2005
as orders and the factory workweek increased.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s  general economic 
index unexpectedly rose to 24.3 from 22.5 last month. The gauge
was forecast to decrease to 15, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey. Readings greater than zero signal
expansion in the area covering eastern Pennsylvania, southern
New Jersey and Delaware.  Growth in China and other emerging economies, corporate
purchases of new equipment and stronger consumer spending are
bolstering production. Manufacturing may keep powering an
economic recovery that Fed policy makers this week said has been
slow to create jobs.  “It certainly adds to evidence that growth is
accelerating,” said  Jim O’Sullivan , global chief economist at
MF Global Inc. in New York. “There is pretty good momentum
going into the new year.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 59 economists ranged
from 5 to 20.5.  Stocks were little changed after the manufacturing figures.
The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose less than 0.1 percent to
1,235.36 at 10:39 a.m. in New York. Treasuries fell, pushing up
the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to 3.54 percent from
3.53 percent late yesterday.  Jobless Claims  Another report from the Labor Department today showed fewer
Americans than forecast filed claims for jobless benefits last
week, a sign the labor market is improving. Applications for
unemployment insurance dropped by 3,000 to 420,000.  The Philadelphia Fed bank’s  new orders measure  climbed to
14.6, the highest since February, from 10.4 in November. A
measure of the average workweek increased to 19.3 in December,
the highest since March 2004, indicating hiring may soon pick
up.  The shipments gauge decreased to 7.3 from 16.8 last month.
The  employment index  fell to 5.1 from 13.3 last month, which was
the highest since August 2007.  The index of prices paid jumped to 51.2, the highest since
July 2008, from 34 the prior month, while its gauge of prices
received increased to a two-year high of 10.7 from minus 2.1.  Empire State  The overall Philadelphia Fed’s index isn’t composed of the
individual measures, so some economists consider it a gauge of
sentiment among manufacturers. The New York Fed’s factory
measure, released yesterday, rebounded to 10.6 this month from
minus 11.1 in November.  Economists monitor the New York and Philadelphia Fed
factory reports for clues about the Institute for Supply
Management national figures on manufacturing during the month.  The  ISM  will release its report on Jan. 3. The measure last
month fell to 56.6 from a five-month high of 56.9.  Manufacturing makes up about 11 percent of the economy and
is getting a boost from expanding world trade. Exports rose 3.2
percent in October to the highest level since August 2008,
according to Commerce Department data released Dec. 10. Business
spending on equipment and software advanced at a 17 percent
annual rate in the third quarter.  Broadcom Corp. , the biggest maker of chips for television
set-top boxes, yesterday increased its fourth-quarter revenue
projection to about $1.9 billion, the top end of an earlier
forecast range. Irvine, California-based Broadcom is making
inroads in the mobile-phone market, supplying radio chips for
handsets from South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and
Finland’s Nokia Oyj.  “We have seen now an extended period of time of recovery
in the components business,” Paul Reilly , chief financial
officer of  Arrow Electronics Inc. , said yesterday at a
conference in New York. Melville, New York-based Arrow is a
distributor of electronic components and computer products to
industrial customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
