European stocks  gained for the
eighth time in nine days after better-than-forecast U.S.
economic data boosted speculation that the recovery is on track.  Ericsson AB  rallied 4.3 percent as Svenska Handelsbanken AB
upgraded the world’s biggest maker of mobile-phone networks.
Danisco A/S, the largest maker of food ingredients, climbed 4.4
percent after earnings topped estimates. BP Plc fell 1.4 percent
after being sued by the Obama administration for violation of
environmental laws in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  rose 0.4 percent to 277.59 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London after swinging between gains and
losses at least 20 times. The gauge has rallied 9.3 percent this
year as companies reported higher earnings, the U.S. Federal
Reserve unveiled a $600 billion bond-purchase program to boost
growth and the European Union bailed out Greece and Ireland.  “The markets are somewhat getting used to the idea of
fiscal sustainability and the challenges in Europe,”  Larry Hatheway , London-based economist and asset-allocation strategist
at UBS AG, said on Bloomberg Television’s ‘Countdown’ with
 Maryam Nemazee . “They are otherwise being greeted by a lot of
good news, particularly out of the U.S. The underlying data flow
is going to continue to improve and that is going to underpin
risk asset performance.”  U.S. Economy  Builders in the U.S. began work on more homes in November
for the first time in three months.  Housing starts  rose to a
555,000 annual rate, Commerce Department figures showed,
exceeding the 550,000 median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists.  Other reports showed the number of U.S. workers filing
first-time claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly
declined last week and manufacturing in the Philadelphia region
expanded in December at the fastest pace since April 2005.  EU leaders began a two-day summit in Brussels today to
agree on a crisis-management mechanism that takes effect in
2013. Strife among German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , the European
Central Bank, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , and
the German domestic opposition intensified on the eve of the
meeting, marring confidence in Europe’s handling of the fiscal
woes that forced Greece and Ireland to seek financial handouts.  The ECB said today it will increase its capital base by 5
billion euros ($6.6 billion) to 10.76 billion euros, suggesting
it’s concerned its 72 billion-euro program of buying the debt of
strained governments may saddle its balance sheet with losses.
The money will come from the 16 national central banks which use
the euro and EU member central banks and will be transferred in
three equal annual tranches through the end of 2012.  Benchmark Indexes  National benchmark indexes advanced in 10 of the 18 western
European markets today. France’s CAC climbed 0.2 percent and
Germany’s  DAX  increased 0.1 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was
little changed.  Ericsson rallied 4.3 percent to 76.2 kronor, leading a
gauge of technology shares to the biggest gain among 19  industry
groups  in the Stoxx 600. Svenska Handelsbanken raised its
recommendation on the shares to “accumulate” from “reduce,”
saying gross margins will be “stronger for longer.”  Danisco  climbed 4.4 percent to 501.5 kroner after reporting
second-quarter net income of 369 million kroner ($65.5 million),
topping the 281 million-krone average estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Zodiac, Serco  Zodiac Aerospace SA  rose 2.9 percent to 55.20 euros.
Europe’s biggest maker of aircraft seats said first-quarter
revenue climbed to 643.6 million euros from 471.5 million euros
a year earlier and confirmed its targets for fiscal 2011.  Serco Group Plc, the operator of London’s Docklands Light
Railway, gained 4.1 percent to 597 pence after saying it remains
“on track” to deliver its financial guidance for 2010.  BP  lost 1.4 percent to 470 pence. The energy company put
profits over safety and is responsible for the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig explosion that set off the largest offshore oil
spill in U.S. history, lawyers suing the company said in a new
court filing.  Transocean Ltd., which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig and
is also a defendant in the lawsuit, fell 3.4 percent to 67.45
Swiss francs in Zurich.  Thales SA retreated 3.7 percent to 26.83 euros as Chief
Executive Officer  Luc Vigneron  told a La Tribune newspaper that
the recovery in margins will be very gradual.  To contact the reporter on this story:
