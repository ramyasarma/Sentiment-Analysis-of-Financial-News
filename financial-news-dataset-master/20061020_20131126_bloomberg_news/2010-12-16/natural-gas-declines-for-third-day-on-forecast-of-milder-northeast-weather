Natural gas futures fell to the
lowest level in almost a month after a government report showed
a decline in U.S. stockpiles that was close to analysts’
forecasts.  Gas tumbled 4.1 percent after the Energy Department said
stockpiles slipped 164 billion cubic feet in the week ended Dec.
10 to 3.561 trillion cubic feet. Analysts had estimated a drop
of 165 billion. Gas also fell as forecasts showed cold weather
will moderate in the U.S. Northeast later this month.  “The market is disappointed,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst
with PFGBest in Chicago. “We are going to see a warmup later
this month and we probably need a much larger withdrawal to get
the bullish flame.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 17.4 cents to settle
at $4.048 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement price since Nov. 18.
Gas has declined 27 percent this year.  Last week’s stockpile decline was bigger than the five-year
average of 153 billion cubic feet, department data showed. A
surplus to the five-year average rose to 9.9 percent from 9.8
percent the previous week. A deficit to year-earlier supplies
narrowed to 1 percent from 1.5 percent.  A survey of Bloomberg users predicted a drop of 163 billion
for the week.  Northeast Temperatures  Temperatures will be above normal in the Northeast and in a
normal range in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania from Dec.
23 to Dec. 29, according to the  National Weather Service .
Weather has been colder than normal since last week.  “The extreme below-normal cold weather is going away and
at the same time we’ve still got tons of gas underground,” said
 Brad Florer , a trader at Kottke Associates Inc., an energy
trading firm in Louisville, Kentucky. “The chart overall still
looks pretty bearish.”  New York will have a high of 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4
degrees Celsius) on Dec. 29, 1 degree below normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania. Boston will
also have a high of 39 degrees, 1 degree above normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  ‘Temperature-Focused’  “The market remains very temperature-focused,”  James R. Crandell , an analyst with Barclays Capital in New York, said in
a note to clients today. “Weather-driven demand has the
potential to change the balance more than any other factor over
the next few months.”  Gas stockpiles will total 1.833 trillion cubic feet at the
end of the winter heating season in March, about 171 billion
cubic feet higher than at the end of March 2010, the Energy
Department said on Dec. 7 in its monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook report.  U.S. natural gas production may reach a record high of
62.09 billion cubic feet a day this year, the department
estimated in the report.  The number of U.S. gas drilling rigs fell for the first
week in three, down 13 to 948 in the week ended Dec. 10,
according to data published by Baker Hughes Inc. The rig count
was 25 percent higher than a year earlier.  This week’s rig report will be released tomorrow.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, fell 2.18 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $4.1938 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
295,629 as of 2:43 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
286,000. Volume was 312,432 yesterday. Open interest was 786,367
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 790,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
