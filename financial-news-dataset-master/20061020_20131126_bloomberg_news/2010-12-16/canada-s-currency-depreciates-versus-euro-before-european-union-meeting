Canada’s dollar weakened against the
euro before European Union leaders meet to discuss a crisis-
fighting system amid concern that deficits in some of the
region’s countries will become unmanageable.  Canada’s currency was flat against the U.S. dollar and fell
versus 12 of its 16 major counterparts. It jumped 1.4 percent
yesterday versus the common currency, the most in three weeks.
Commodities including copper and crude oil declined.  “We had a big move down in the euro versus the Canadian
dollar yesterday,”  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist in
Toronto at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit, wrote in
an e-mail. “Today is perhaps a little profit taking.”  The Canadian currency fell as much as 0.4 percent to
C$1.3334 per euro, close to the C$1.3206 it reached on Dec. 2,
the weakest level since Sept. 14. It was down 0.2 percent to
C$1.3310 at 8:09 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.3279. The
loonie was little changed at C$1.0048 versus the U.S. dollar.
One Canadian dollar buys 99.52 U.S. cents.  EU leaders start a two-day summit in Brussels today with
the focus on a permanent crisis-fighting system. They’re close
to agreeing on an amendment to the bloc’s Lisbon Treaty
foreseeing a “mechanism to safeguard the stability of the euro
area as a whole” with financial aid for distressed governments
“subject to strict conditionality,” officials told reporters
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
