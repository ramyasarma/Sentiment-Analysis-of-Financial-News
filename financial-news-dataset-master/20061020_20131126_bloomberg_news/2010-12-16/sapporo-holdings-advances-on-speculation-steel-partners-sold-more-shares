Sapporo Holdings Ltd. , the maker of
Yebisu beer, rose to the highest level in more than two months
in Tokyo trading on speculation  Warren Lichtenstein ’s Steel
Partners further reduced its stake in the brewer.  Sapporo jumped 5.5 percent to 384 yen at the 3 p.m. close
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the highest level since Oct. 6. The
Tokyo-based company was the biggest gainer on the benchmark
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average , which was little changed.  Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund (Offshore) LP and
Liberty Square Asset Management LP cut their combined holding in
Sapporo to 7.9 percent, from a level of 13.1 percent in October,
according to filings to Japan’s finance ministry on Dec. 9.
Lichtenstein’s fund began trimming its stake in Sapporo, Japan’s
fourth-biggest beermaker, as it lost a shareholder vote in March
to force changes including the ousting of directors.  There is a speculation that Steel Partners further reduced
its  shareholding  after the filing last week,  Tsuyoshi Segawa , a
strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo, said by telephone.
“Individual investors are coming back to the brewer now that it
can focus on its business instead of dealing with Steel
Partners.”  Katsuhito Ogawa , a spokesman for Sapporo, and  Masako Matsuoka , a spokeswoman for Steel Partners Japan, declined to
comment when reached by telephone.  A shareholder who holds at least 5 percent of a publicly
traded company has to file documents to Japan’s Ministry of
Finance within five working days if there is a change in its
shareholding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
