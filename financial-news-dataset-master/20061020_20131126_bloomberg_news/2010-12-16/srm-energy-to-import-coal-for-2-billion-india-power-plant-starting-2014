SRM Energy Ltd. , part of India’s
 Spice Energy Group , plans to import 5 million metric tons of
coal a year starting 2014 for a $2 billion power plant.  The 2,000-megawatt facility, to be built in the southern
Indian state of Tamil Nadu, will burn as much as 8 million tons
of coal a year, of which 70 percent will be imported, D.
Sundararajan, chief executive of the company, said in a
telephone interview from Mumbai yesterday.  “We have tied up coal from Indonesia but we are receiving
offers for African coal as well,” he said. The company has a
long-term contract for the supply of Indonesian coal, which
would be at a discount to market price, he said.  India, Asia’s fastest-growing major economy behind China,
is burning more of the fuel as economic expansion raises demand.
The government has pledged to provide electricity nationwide by
2012. The country needs to increase installed capacity to
200,000 megawatts to sustain economic growth, according to the
power ministry.  More than half of the current capacity of 167,278 megawatts
is fueled by coal.  The Mumbai-based company is also considering importing coal
from South Africa and Mozambique, Sundararajan said.  SRM Energy signed a $1.4 billion contract with a unit of
China Datang Corp. yesterday to supply it with thermal power
units based on “super-critical technology,” Sundararajan said.
This technology helps facilities use less energy and generate
higher pressure for greater efficiency than traditional plants.  Bank Borrowings  A group of banks led by Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd., the world’s largest lender by market value, will
finance 85 percent of the plant’s cost, Sundararajan said.  The company plans to borrow as much as $300 million from
Indian banks, and obtain about $500 million in equity financing
for the project, he said. SRM Energy aims to start building the
plant in April and begin operation at the first unit in 2014.  Coal demand from India’s power industry may double by March
2017 from 450 million tons in the current financial year, Power
Secretary P.  Uma Shankar  said Dec. 9.  India produces 530 million tons of coal a year and imports
about 67 million tons, Coal Minister  Sriprakash Jaiswal  said
Sept. 24. The country faces a shortfall of 104 million tons in
the 12 months ending March 2012, mjunction Services Ltd., a
Kolkata-based commodity trader, said in a Dec. 6 note, citing
Jaiswal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
