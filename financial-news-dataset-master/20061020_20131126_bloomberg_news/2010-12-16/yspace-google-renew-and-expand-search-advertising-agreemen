MySpace, the social-networking
website owned by  News Corp. , signed a new multiyear search
advertising agreement with Google Inc.  Google will continue to power Beverly Hills, California-
based MySpace’s search functions and search advertising, and
will also provide display-advertising services, the companies
said today in a statement.  The previous arrangement with Google expired in June and
was extended leading up to MySpace’s redesign, introduced in
October. The companies didn’t disclose the financial terms or
duration of the new deal. In 2006, Google, owner of the world’s
largest Web-search engine, agreed to pay $900 million over three
years to place ads on MySpace.  A new search agreement would probably be performance-based
and worth less than the previous Google deal, News Corp. Chief
Operating Officer  Chase Carey  said Aug. 4 at an investor
conference.  MySpace’s traffic fell short of commitments to Google,
lowering the most recent fiscal year’s income on the deal by
$100 million, the company projected in 2009. The money-losing
site has also struggled with management turnover since News
Corp. purchased it for $580 million in 2005.  News Corp., the New York-based media company controlled by
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch , rose 5
cents to $14.44 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market
 trading . Mountain View, California-based Google gained $1.41 to
$591.71.  To contact the reporters on this story:
