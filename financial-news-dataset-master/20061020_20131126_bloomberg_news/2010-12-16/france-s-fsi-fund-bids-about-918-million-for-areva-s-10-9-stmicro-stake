France’s sovereign-wealth fund
offered to buy  Areva SA ’s stake in chipmaker STMicroelectronics
NV for 695 million euros ($921 million), giving the nuclear-
reactor maker more funds to expand as it faces a possible credit
rating cut.  The Strategic Investment Fund began exclusive talks with
Areva and has made an offer of 7 euros a share for the 10.9
percent stake in STMicroelctronics, the fund said in an e-mailed
statement.  “The approval of this transaction is subject, among other
authorizations, to an information and consultation procedure
with the employee representative body and to the approval of
relevant competition authorities,” Paris-based Areva said in a
separate statement.  Standard and Poor’s said yesterday that a one-level cut in
Areva’s BBB+  credit rating  “is likely” within three months
because the company’s 900-million euro capital increase due Dec.
27 is less than half what the rating company expected and asset
sales have been slower than expected.  S&P cut Areva’s debt rating on June 28 by two steps to
BBB+, the third-lowest investment grade. Areva may face a
negative free cash flow of 2.6 billion euros in 2010, and of as
much as 2 billion euros in 2011 and 1 billion euros in 2012, the
rating company said.  Cash Flow  Areva reiterated Dec. 11 that it expects “significantly
positive free operating cash flow” in 2012. The world’s largest
supplier of nuclear equipment and services will have net  debt  of
about 4 billion euros at the end of the year, and more than 2
billion euros of unused credit lines, Chief Financial Officer
 Alain-Pierre Raynaud  said on a Dec. 13 conference call. The
company expects up to 2 billion euros in capital expenditure in
2011 and 2012, he said.  About 4 percent of Areva trades on the Paris stock exchange
as non-voting  investment certificates . They rose 0.1 percent to
361 euros at 10:22 a.m. in Paris, taking their gain this year to
3.4 percent.  Kuwait Investment Authority is due to buy 600 million euros
of new Areva shares in the capital increase, giving it about 4.8
percent of the nuclear holding company. The state, which owns 91
percent of Areva, will purchase an additional 300 million euros
of new stock.  3 Billion Euros  France has been in talks for about a year to sell as much
as 15 percent of the company to Kuwait, Japan’s  Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd.  and the sovereign fund of Qatar. Areva Chief
Executive Officer  Anne Lauvergeon  originally aimed to raise 3
billion euros in the capital increase to help fund spending on
equipment, plants and uranium mines to fend off competition and
sell more reactors and fuel in Europe, China and India.  “When the time comes, the state and Areva will consider
new financing to complement this first capital increase, if need
be,” the French Finance Ministry said Dec. 10.  Areva, whose  finances  have been hurt by construction-cost
overruns at a reactor in Finland since 2005, raised 5.2 billion
euros in 2009 and 2010 by selling its power-grid unit, as well
as stakes in Safran SA, GDF Suez SA and Total SA and other
minority interests. It has also sold 3.75 billion euros of  bonds 
since September 2009.  Areva’s debt includes 2.1 billion euros that’s earmarked
for the purchase of Siemens AG’s 34 percent stake in a reactor
joint venture by January 2012. Munich-based Siemens used an
option to exit the business last year after agreeing to create a
rival partnership with Russia’s Rosatom Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Francois de Beaupuy  in
