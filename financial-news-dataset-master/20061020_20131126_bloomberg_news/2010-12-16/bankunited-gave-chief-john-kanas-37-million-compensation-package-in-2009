BankUnited Inc., the Florida bank
acquired by private-equity investors after it failed in 2009,
gave Chief Executive Officer John Kanas compensation last year
valued at $37.2 million.  Kanas, who’s also chairman of the board and president of
Miami Lakes-based BankUnited, was awarded $35.8 million in stock
and $1.38 million in salary, according to a revised prospectus
today for the firm’s initial public offering. Kanas joined
BankUnited in May 2009, so his salary was pro-rated, according
to the filing. For a full calendar year, he’s entitled to $2.25
million, with half paid by the bank and half by BU Financial
Holdings LLC, which controls BankUnited.  BankUnited Financial Corp. was shut by regulators in 2009
and its assets sold to private-equity firms including WL Ross &
Co., Carlyle Group, Blackstone Group LP and Centerbridge Capital
Partners LLC. Kanas built North Fork Bancorp from a local bank
on Long Island’s East End into the No. 3 lender in the New York
City region, then sold it to Capital One Financial Corp. in
December 2006 for $13.6 billion.  Melissa Gracey, a BankUnited spokeswoman, declined to
