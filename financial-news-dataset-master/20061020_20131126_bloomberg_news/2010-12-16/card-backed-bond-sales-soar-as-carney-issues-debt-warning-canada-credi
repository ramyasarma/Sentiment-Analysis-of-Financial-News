Sales of bonds backed by credit-card
payments in Canada are increasing at the same time the central-
bank governor and the prime minister warn about soaring
household debt.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada,
Loblaws Cos. and other firms have sold about C$4.5 billion ($4.5
billion) in bonds tied to credit-card receivables this year, as
overall sales of term asset-backed securities approach 2006
levels, according to Standard & Poor’s. Sales dried up between
July 2008 and April 2010 amid the financial crisis.  “Issuance in Canada is back,”  Maria Rabiasz , senior
director of Canadian structured finance ratings at S&P, said by
phone from Toronto. “There’s investor appetite out there for
these products and at the same time the pricing has tightened.
So it’s a win-win situation and you can tap the credit markets
again.”  The Canadian economic recovery, among the fastest in the
Group of Seven, is giving investors confidence in the safety of
assets backed by Canadian mortgages, credit cards and car loans.
Sales of asset-backed securities exceeded C$28 billion in 2010,
a record, boosted by more than C$17 billion in covered-bond
issuance, according to S&P data. Issuance of credit-card-backed
debt in the U.S. has plummeted amid higher household savings
rates and stricter lending standards.  More Debt  Canada’s ratio of household debt to disposable income was
1.48 in the third quarter, according to Statistics Canada,
exceeding the U.S. level for the first time in 12 years. Bank of
Canada Governor  Mark Carney , Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  and
Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said in separate appearances this
week they’re concerned about rising debt and the risks that
poses to the nation’s economic recovery.  Elsewhere in credit markets, Canada sold C$3 billion of
two-year bonds,  Agrium Inc.  sold $500 million of bonds and
housing sales in November gained 4.8 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to own the debt of
Canadian corporations rather than the federal government
remained at 142 basis points yesterday, or 1.42 percentage
points, unchanged from Dec. 14, according to a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index. Corporate bonds are up 5.7 percent this
year, compared with 8 percent for U.S. corporate bonds and 6.2
percent for global corporates.  Agrium, the Calgary-based fertilizer maker, sold $500
million of senior unsecured debt maturing in January 2041. The
6.125 percent debt priced to yield 160 basis points over
Treasuries.  Quebecor Bonds  Quebecor Media sold C$325 million of 7.375 percent bonds
maturing in January 2021. The debt priced to yield 395.7 basis
points over benchmarks.  In provincial bond markets, relative yields stayed at 52
basis points as yields fell to 3.35 percent, according to
Merrill Lynch data. The 397 bonds with a par value of C$468
billion have advanced 5.3 percent this year, after gains of 3.7
percent and 6.8 percent in the previous two years.  Government bonds are down 1.4 percent this month, trimming
the 2010 advance to 4.7 percent. That compares with a gain of
4.8 percent this year for Treasuries.  Canada auctioned C$3 billion of bonds due in March 2013,
drawing an average yield of 1.787 percent. The government
received bids of C$6.9 billion for the 1.75 percent notes
maturing, according to a statement yesterday on the Bank of
Canada’s website.  Seasonally adjusted Canadian sales of existing homes rose
4.8 percent in November from the previous month and the value of
homes sold increased 6.7 percent to C$13 billion, according to a
statement from the Canadian Real Estate Association.  Seasonally adjusted unit sales rose to 37,658 in November
from 35,936 units a month earlier, the group said.  ‘Increasingly Vulnerable’  “Canadian households are increasingly vulnerable to an
adverse shock,” Carney said in the  text  of a Dec. 13 speech in
Toronto, citing Bank of Canada analysis. “This vulnerability
has been rising more quickly than had been previously
anticipated.”  Household credit in Canada has grown by 7 percent from the
trough in output, compared with a decline of 3.5 percent in the
U.S., the central-bank chief said. A 3 percentage-point increase
in the unemployment rate would double the proportion of loans in
arrears more than three months, he said.  Foreigners bought a net C$9.51 billion of Canadian
securities in October, more than half of which was corporate
bonds, approaching an annual record, Ottawa-based Statistics
Canada said today.  Card-Backed Bonds  Royal Bank issued C$900 million of card-backed bonds in May
through its Golden Credit Card Trust unit. The five-year bonds,
rated Aaa by Moody’s and AAA by DBRS Ltd., have a coupon of
3.824 percent. Yields on the debt have fallen from as high as
3.67 percent in June to as low as 2.5 percent in October and
ended yesterday at 3.26 percent.  Loblaw’s Eagle Credit Card Trust sold C$600 million of
three-year and five-year debt backed by credit cards on Dec. 8.
The debt had a weighted-average cost of issuance of 3.29
percent, the trust said in a  statement .  The Canadian credit-card market, with about C$19 billion
outstanding, has an average payment rate of 25 percent, loss
rate of 5.1 percent and delinquencies of 3.5 percent, according
to S&P data. That compares with U.S. public-trust credit cards,
a $319 billion market, with a payment rate of 20 percent, a loss
rate of 8.1 percent and delinquencies of 4.5 percent, the data
show.  Writedowns in Canada dropped to 8.1 percent through
October, compared with 9.3 percent a year ago, S&P data show.  Stabilized Market  “The market has stabilized,”  Kevin Chiang , senior vice
president of Canadian structured finance at DBRS Ltd., said by
phone from Toronto. “Credit losses have come down from the peak
of last year and payment rates have improved or at least
stabilized.”  Issuance of debt backed by credit cards is C$4.5 billion
this year, compared with zero last year and C$7.6 billion in
2008, Chiang said.  Yields on asset-backed bonds in Canada average 79 basis
points more than government debt, down from 335 in January 2009,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Canadian Asset-
Backed Index, which tracks 20 bonds with C$10 billion
outstanding. Spreads contracted to 66 basis points on Nov. 19,
the least since August 2007 on a weekly closing basis, and have
averaged 73 basis points over the life of the index on a monthly
closing basis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
