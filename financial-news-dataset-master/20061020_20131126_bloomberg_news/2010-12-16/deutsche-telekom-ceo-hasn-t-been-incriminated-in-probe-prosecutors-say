The Bonn prosecutor’s office has so
far found nothing incriminating against  Deutsche Telekom AG ’s
Chief Executive Officer  Rene Obermann  in an investigation into
alleged bribery in Hungary and Macedonia.  “The investigation continues, but we haven’t found any
incriminating evidence against Obermann so far,”  Friedrich
Apostel , spokesman for the Bonn prosecutors, said in a telephone
interview today. He declined to comment on a report by
 Rheinische Post  that the probe will be closed soon.  The case, which is also being investigated by U.S.
securities regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice,
concerns Deutsche Telekom units in Hungary and Macedonia. The
prosecutors are investigating whether bribes were used to
prevent Macedonia from opening the nation’s telecommunications
to competition and raided the private homes of Obermann and
other people in late August.  There are claims Obermann told the CEO of the
Makedonski Telekom unit he would only approve dividend payments
if the nation’s telecom market remained closed,  Manfred Balz ,
Deutsche Telekom’s management board member for legal affairs,
told reporters in September.  Balz said at the time that the allegations against Obermann
are false and that he expected the probe against him to be
closed “swiftly.”  Obermann is one of eight suspects in the investigation.
Deutsche Telekom spokesman  Mark Nierwetberg  declined to comment
on the probe via phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Ragnhild Kjetland  in
