England bowled Australia out for 268
on the opening day of the third Ashes cricket Test in Perth
after winning the toss.  Fast bowler  Chris Tremlett , playing his first Test since
2007, took 3-63 at the WACA Ground, while  James Anderson  claimed
3-61 after returning to the U.K. for the birth of his second
child in between matches. Steve Finn and  Graeme Swann  each took
two wickets.  Mitchell Johnson  top scored for Australia with 62, with
Michael Hussey and Brad Haddin also making half-centuries.  A victory at the WACA would give the touring team an
unbeatable 2-0 lead in the best-of-five contest. As holder,
England would retain the Ashes by tying the series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
