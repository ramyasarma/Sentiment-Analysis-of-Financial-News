More than two-thirds of Europe’s
insurers participated in the fifth test of a proposed new
regulatory framework.  The Frankfurt-based Committee of European Insurance and
Occupational Pension Supervisors, or  Ceiops , is developing the
rules, known as Solvency II, with local regulators. The risk-
based system is designed to ensure the industry will be able to
withstand a repeat of the global financial crisis.  The latest proposals for Solvency II, due to be
introduced in 2013, have been tested by “almost 70 percent
of all insurance and reinsurance companies” in a fifth
quantitative-impact study, known as  QIS5 , Ceiops said today in a
 statement . That compares with 33 percent in the previous study,
QIS4, the regulator said.  Ceiops plans to publish the results of  QIS5  in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
