Paul Pierce  hit a 14-foot jump shot
with 0.4 seconds remaining to give the Boston Celtics a 118-116
win over the New York Knicks.  Pierce had 32 points as the Celtics extended their winning
streak to 11 games by handing the Knicks their first defeat in
nine games. Boston has the best record in the National
Basketball Association’s Eastern Conference at 20-4.  Amar’e Stoudemire  had 39 points for the Knicks, his ninth
straight game with 30 points or more.  Danilo Gallinari  had all
20 of his points in the second half for the Knicks at Madison
Square Garden in New York.  Pierce, who proclaimed before the game that the Knicks no
longer qualified as rivals of the Celtics, was more
complimentary in a televised interview after last night’s game.  “The Knicks have arrived and they’re going to be guys to
reckon with in the division,” Pierce said.  The Celtics, who hit all 21 of their free throws in the
game, trailed by 12 points with five minutes left in the third
period.  Boston took its first lead since the third minute of the
game when  Ray Allen  hit a 3-pointer from the corner with 1:01
remaining in the contest. Gallinari’s three-point play tied the
game at 116. Stoudemire missed a 4-foot jumper with 13 seconds
left, setting up Pierce’s winner.  After Pierce’s shot and a timeout, the Knicks inbounded the
ball to Stoudemire about five feet behind the 3-point line and
he swished a potentially winning shot through the basket, only
to have the referees rule it didn’t count because it came after
the final buzzer.  The Knicks host  LeBron James  and the Miami Heat tomorrow
night. The Heat extended their winning streak to 10 games with a
101-95 victory last night at home against Cleveland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
