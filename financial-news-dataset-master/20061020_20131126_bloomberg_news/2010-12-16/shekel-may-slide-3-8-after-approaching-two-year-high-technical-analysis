The Israeli shekel’s rally to within
4 agorot of a two-year high signals that it may weaken 3.8
percent against the dollar within two weeks, according to Forex
Capital Markets LLC.  The shekel has surged 2.2 percent to 3.5970 per dollar in
the past month, the second-best performance among the 10 most-
traded emerging-market currencies in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The advance
will probably fizzle as the shekel approaches 3.5586 per dollar,
the two-year high reached on Oct. 15,  Joel Kruger , a Jerusalem-
based technical currency strategist at FXCM, said in a phone
interview.  “From a risk-reward standpoint, it’s a smart bet to expect
that once the rate goes down to about 3.559, it will begin to
consolidate back up to 3.7 per dollar,” he said. “I think it
will test yearly highs in the coming sessions and may reverse
directions, with dollar appreciation ensuing.”  A retreat in the shekel from 3.5586 per dollar to 3.7 per
dollar would represent a drop of 3.8 percent. The currency would
fall more should it drop to weaker than 3.7020 per dollar, its
two-month intraday low touched on Nov. 30, Kruger said.
Resistance levels indicate ceilings restricting further price
increases, while support levels signal floors limiting declines.  The shekel has been “chopping around” since September,
trading with “no clear direction” between 3.7 per dollar and
3.55 per dollar, Kruger said. While the currency is poised for a
slump, a rally beyond 3.55 per dollar could lead to “levels not
seen since the 2008 highs,” Kruger said.  The shekel has weakened 12 percent from a high of 3.2024
per dollar in July 2008 as Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  more than doubled foreign currency reserves in an
attempt to limit gains in the shekel and help exporters weather
the global economic crisis.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
