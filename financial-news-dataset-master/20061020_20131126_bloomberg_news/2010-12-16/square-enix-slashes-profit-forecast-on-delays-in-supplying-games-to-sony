Square Enix Holdings Co. , the
Japanese creator of “Final Fantasy” game series, cut its full-
year profit forecast 92 percent to the lowest in at least eight
years, citing delays in release of the software.  Net income  will probably fall to 1 billion yen ($12
million) in the year ending March 31 compared with an earlier
forecast for 12 billion yen, the company said in a statement to
the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. A year earlier, Square Enix
reported a 9.51 billion yen profit.  Profit is expected to slump because of the delay in
releasing “Final Fantasy XIV” online game for Sony Corp.’s
PlayStation 3 and “ Deus Ex ” title for the PS3 and Microsoft
Corp.’s Xbox 360, the Tokyo-based company said. Japan’s largest
maker of role-playing video games is predicting its  smallest 
annual profit since 2003, when the company was formed after the
merger of Square Co. with Enix Corp.  Square Enix  fell 1.4 percent to 1,599 yen at the 3 p.m.
close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The forecast was
released after trading hours.  Sales may decline 32 percent to 130 billion yen in the
period, faster than the 19 percent drop forecast earlier, Square
Enix said. Operating profit, or revenue minus the cost of goods
sold and administrative expenses, will fall 72 percent to 8
billion yen, compared with the earlier target of 20 billion yen.  -- Editors: Vipin V. Nair, Anand Krishnamoorthy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
