Fleury SA , a Brazilian provider of
medical services, climbed to a record after agreeing to buy
rival  Labs D’Or  for 1.04 billion reais ($610.7 million).  Fleury advanced 3 percent to 25.75 reais at 11:12 a.m. New
York time. The stock climbed to 26.30 reais earlier today, the
highest price since its initial public offering last year, as
276,100 shares traded, 60 percent higher than the daily average
for the past three months.  Fleury said in a filing that it signed a memorandum of
understanding to pay for 50 percent of the medical laboratory
network in cash, and 50 percent in new common stock. After the
transaction is completed, Labs D’Or partners will own 15 percent
of Fleury, according to the statement.  The deal will help Fleury compete in Rio de Janeiro with
Diagnosticos da America SA, Latin America’s biggest medical
diagnostics company by market value, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  “Fleury has finally made an attractive use of the cash
from” its IPO, JPMorgan analyst Andrea Teixeira wrote in a note
to clients dated yesterday. The “deal seems accretive at
attractive valuation.”  With the Lab D’Or acquisition, Fleury will provide services
to 27 hospitals, up from 8 now, and expand its network in Rio de
Janeiro to 85 units, from 29 now.  Rival Dasa fell 1.6 percent to 21.54 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
