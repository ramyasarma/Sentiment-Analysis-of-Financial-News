Defending champion Atletico Madrid
was eliminated from soccer’s Europa League as Lille, Aris
Salonika and Anderlecht claimed the final three places in the
round of 32.  Atletico, needing to win to have any hope of advancing,
drew 1-1 with Bayer Leverkusen to finish third in Group B. Aris
won 2-0 at home over Rosenborg to take second place behind
Leverkusen on the final day of group stage play.  The top two from each of the 12 groups advance to the round
of 32, where they’re joined by the eight third-place teams from
the elite Champions League.  Lille’s 3-0 win over Gent took it past its opponent into
second place in Group C. Sporting Lisbon finished atop the group
even after a 1-0 loss at Levski Sofia.  Anderlecht beat Hajduk Split 2-0 to leap into second in
Group G over AEK Athens, which lost at home to group winner
Zenit St. Petersburg 3-0.  Manchester City drew 1-1 at Juventus to win Group A ahead
of Lech Poznan, a 1-0 winner at Salzburg. Stuttgart defeated
Odense 5-1 to claim the top spot in Group H, while second-place
Young Boys lost 1-0 to Getafe.  PSV won Group I after a 0-0 tie against Metalist Kharkiv in
a matchup of qualified teams, while Debrecen defeated Sampdoria
2-0.  The draw for the round of 32 will be held today, with the
group winners guaranteed not to meet each other.  To contact the reporter on this story:
