General Motors Co . and  Ford Motor
Co . said plants affected by a shortage of parts coming from
Canada have returned to normal output.  GM’s seven plants that shut down or shortened shifts are
running again today, Chris Lee, a spokesman for the Detroit-
based automaker, said in a telephone interview. Ford’s four
affected plants are running today, said  Todd Nissen , a spokesman
for the Dearborn, Michigan-based company.  Some roads in Canada had been closed after winter storms
earlier in the week. Lost production can affect automakers’
sales because the companies record revenue when vehicles are
assembled. GM’s Lee and Ford’s Nissen said the companies are
considering ways to make up for the lost output.  The parts shortages cut production at GM’s Flint, Lansing
Grand River and Lansing Delta plants in Michigan, the CAMI and
Oshawa plants in Ontario, the Fort Wayne plant in Indiana and
the Lordstown plant in Ohio.  Ford’s Ohio assembly plant in Avon Lake, the Oakville and
St. Thomas plants in Ontario and Chicago assembly plant shut
down or shortened shifts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
