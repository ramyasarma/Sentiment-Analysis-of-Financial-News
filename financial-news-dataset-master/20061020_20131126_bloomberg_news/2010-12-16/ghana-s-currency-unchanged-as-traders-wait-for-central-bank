Ghana’s currency, the cedi, was
unchanged against the dollar on expectations that the country’s
central bank might sell the foreign currency.  Traders “are waiting to see whether the central bank will
come to the market, maybe today,” said Chris Nettey, a currency
trader at Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s unit in the West African
nation.  The currency was trading at 1.4690 on the interbank market
as of 1:11 p.m. Accra time, according to Standard Bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
