Nord Stream AG  signed letters of
commitment with 24 banks as it raises 2.5 billion euros ($3.3
billion) to expand a pipeline to ship Russian gas under the
Baltic Sea to Germany.  The Nord Stream venture, led by Russia’s  OAO Gazprom , plans
to close financing for the second phase of the project by the
end of January, Frank Dudley, a spokesman for the Zug,
Switzerland-based venture, said by phone today. He declined to
name the banks, saying 21 of them also took part in the first-
phase financing.  Nord Stream is building the first 27.5 billion-cubic-meter-
a-year pipeline, which will start delivering Russian gas to the
European Union bypassing transit states such as Ukraine next
year. The project partners plan to double capacity by adding a
second line with the same capacity a year later.  The venture raised 3.9 billion euros from 26 banks in March
for the first phase of the project, which backed construction of
the first of two lines running side by side.  The banks offered 60 percent more loans than needed for the
second phase of the project, Dudley said today. The first-phase
financing was also 60 percent oversubscribed.  Gazprom owns 51 percent of Nord Stream, while Germany’s
Wintershall Holding AG and  E.ON Ruhrgas AG  hold 15.5 percent
each, and Nederlandse Gasunie NV and GDF Suez SA have 9 percent
each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
