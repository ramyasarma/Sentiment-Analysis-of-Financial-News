Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. ,
publisher of “Grand Theft Auto” video games, posted fourth-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates on sales of “Red
Dead Redemption” and its basketball title. The stock rose.  Profit excluding some costs was 67 cents a share, the
company said today in a statement, compared with the 31-cent
average of seven analysts’  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey. The
company had forecast 20 cents to 30 cents on that basis.  The results marked the third-straight quarter of
profitability for New York-based Take-Two after losses in three
of the past four years. Net income totaled $53.8 million, or 58
cents a share, as sales rose 32 percent to $373.7 million.
Revenue exceeded analysts’ estimates of $321.3 million.  “We had any number of exciting releases this year that did
extraordinarily well,” Chairman  Strauss Zelnick  said in a
telephone interview. “We’re firing on all cylinders.”  Take-Two advanced 90 cents, or 7.5 percent, to $12.84 in
extended trading after results were announced. The stock fell 6
cents to $11.94 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market
 trading  and has gained 19 percent this year.  In October, Take-Two announced a change to a fiscal year
ending on March 31 from Oct. 31.  For the current quarter ending Dec. 31, Take-Two projects
sales of $290 million to $315 million and profit of 25 cents to
35 cents a share, excluding some items.  “The company appears to be on a path to consistent
profitability,”  Michael Pachter , an analyst with Wedbush
Securities in Los Angeles, said in a research note to investors
before the results were announced.  Take-Two appeared to benefit from  Electronic Arts Inc. ’s
decision to cancel “NBA Elite 11,” a rival basketball game
that was scheduled for October. Take-Two probably sold more than
1.9 million copies of its “NBA 2K11,” Pachter said.  The decision by Electronic Arts probably added $25 million
in revenue to Take-Two’s sales,  Atul Bagga , a ThinkEquity
analyst, said in a research note.  Editors:  Rob Golum ,  Anthony Palazzo   To contact the reporter on this story:
