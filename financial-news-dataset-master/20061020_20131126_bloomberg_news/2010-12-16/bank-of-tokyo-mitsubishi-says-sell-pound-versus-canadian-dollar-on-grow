(Corrects headline to show advice is to sell pound.)  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
advised investors to sell the pound against the Canadian dollar
because the North American country’s exports to the U.S. should
boost its economy relative to the U.K.  “Divergences in the pace of economic growth will begin to
emerge in 2011 between those countries which rely more heavily
on external demand from the U.S. and those that rely more
heavily on Europe,”  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist in
London, wrote in a research report yesterday. “Furthermore,
domestic austerity measures will also begin to kick in more
notably next year in the U.K.”  The “non-negligible risk that concerns over the long-term
sustainability of the U.S. public finances could build” makes
the Canadian dollar a better currency than its U.S. counterpart
for investors betting against sterling, Hardman said.  The pound will probably weaken to 1.4850 Canadian dollars,
Hardman wrote. Sterling was little changed at 1.5638 Canadian
dollars at 7:18 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
