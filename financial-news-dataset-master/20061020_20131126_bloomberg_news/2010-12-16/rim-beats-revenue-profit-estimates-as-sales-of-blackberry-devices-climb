Research In Motion Ltd. , maker of
the BlackBerry smartphone, reported third-quarter revenue and
profit that topped analysts’  estimates , helped by demand for
models such as the Curve and touch-screen Torch.  Sales  rose  40 percent to $5.49 billion, RIM said today in a
statement. Analysts had predicted $5.41 billion, the average of
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share were $1.74
compared with an average estimate, excluding some costs, of
$1.65. RIM added 5.1 million new subscribers, while analysts
estimated 5.2 million.  RIM is counting on a new version of the BlackBerry Bold and
the Torch, which has a slide-out keyboard and better Internet
browser, to lure customers away from  Apple Inc .’s iPhone. RIM is
also tapping demand in markets such as Brazil and Indonesia for
less expensive models like the Curve, which incorporate its free
instant-messaging system, to fend off the challenge from a slew
of new phones based on  Google Inc. ’s Android software.  Revenue this quarter will be $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion
and earnings per share will be $1.74 to $1.80, RIM said.
Analysts  projected  revenue of $5.46 billion and profit of $1.61
a share. The company said it expects BlackBerry shipments this
quarter of 14.5 million to 15 million units, exceeding the
average estimate from analysts of 14.2 million units.  “The fact that guidance is decently above consensus, to me
that’s pretty positive,” said  Tavis McCourt , an analyst at
Morgan Keegan & Co. in Nashville, Tennessee. He has an
“outperform” rating on the stock. “It’s not a blowout, but
things are trending in the right direction.”  New Operating System  An improved BlackBerry 6 operating system, a strong ad
campaign and AT&T Inc.’s price cut to $99.99 in the U.S. made
the Torch “a strong selling product” last quarter, Wunderlich
Securities analyst  Matthew Robison  wrote in a Dec. 10 note.
Robison, based in Denver, has a “buy” rating on the stock.  Net income for the third quarter climbed to $911.1 million
from $628.4 million, or $1.10 cents a share, a year earlier.  Still, RIM continues to lose market share globally to the
iPhone and Android handsets. RIM’s share of the global
smartphone market slid to 15 percent in the third quarter from
20 percent a year earlier, according to researcher IDC. Apple’s
was unchanged at 17 percent while Samsung Electronics Co., which
uses Android, jumped to 8.9 percent from 3 percent.  RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario,  rose  1.6 percent in late
trading to $60.18, after closing 6 cents higher at $59.24 on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has jumped 38 percent since
August, narrowing its loss for the year to 12 percent.  PlayBook Surge  The stock’s recent surge has been driven by expectations
for the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, which RIM will begin selling
in the U.S. to go head to head with Apple’s market-leading iPad.  RIM may sell 2.55 million tablets, generating about $1.1
billion in revenue in its first full year of sales, according to
a Bloomberg survey of 17 analysts. By contrast, Apple sold 4.19
million iPads last quarter, for revenue of $2.8 billion.  Co-Chief Executive Officer  Jim Balsillie  reiterated on a
conference call with analysts today that the PlayBook will be
introduced in the first quarter of 2011, amid a flurry of new,
competing devices from Samsung and Motorola Inc., and an
expected second version of the iPad.  ‘Overwhelming Interest’  Some corporate customers are delaying plans to buy rival
tablet devices while they wait for the PlayBook, Balsillie said.
There is “overwhelming interest” to get hold of the PlayBook,
which “redefines what a tablet should do,” he said.  The gross margin, or percentage of sales left after costs,
widened to 43.6 percent last quarter, compared with an average
analyst estimate of 42 percent. RIM said its margin should be
similar this quarter and is targeting a percentage in the “low
40s” in its next fiscal year.  RIM named Balsillie and co-Chief Executive Officer  Mike Lazaridis  as co-chairmen. Balsillie stepped down as chairman of
the company in March 2007, after a review of its stock-option
grants and a restatement of its results.  (The replay of the company’s Q3 conference call can be

30, 2010. It can be accessed by dialing 416-640-1917 and
