XL Group Plc , the Bermuda-based
insurer and reinsurer, jumped the most since Sept. 8 after it
was granted a license by a Chinese regulator to operate a
property-casualty carrier in Shanghai.  Shares advanced 72 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $21.62 at 4:15
p.m. today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. XL has
risen 18 percent this year, compared with the 22 percent
increase for the 24-company  KBW Insurance Index .  Insurers are expanding in China, the world’s most populous
country. Chubb Corp., the Warren, New Jersey-based insurer of
commercial property and high-end homes, received permission to
establish a branch in Jiangsu Province, according to a statement
issued today. It already operates a subsidiary, Chubb Insurance
China Co., in the country.  “The Chinese insurance market has great strategic
importance,” XL Chief Executive Officer  Michael McGavick  said
in a statement. We “look forward to contributing to the
development of the insurance industry in China.” XL will start
business after completing regulatory registrations, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
