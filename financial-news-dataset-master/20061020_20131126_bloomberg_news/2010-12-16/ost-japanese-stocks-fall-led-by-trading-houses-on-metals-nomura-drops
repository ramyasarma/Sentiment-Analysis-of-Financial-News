Japanese  stocks  rose, sending the
Topix index to its fourth straight gain, as the yen’s drop
against the dollar buoyed exporters and as banks advanced after
Nomura Holdings Inc. advised investors to buy on valuations.  Honda Motor Co. climbed 1.3 percent as the dollar traded
near a three-month high against the yen after data showed
manufacturing in the New York region jumped more than forecast.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 2 bank by
market value, gained 2.2 percent.  Dena Co. , an operator of game
and shopping websites, surged 9.9 percent after saying it will
supply Samsung Electronics Co. with its social-gaming platform.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 1.51 point to 10,311.29
at 3 p.m. in Tokyo. The broader  Topix  index gained 0.2 percent
to 903.84 after briefly rising as much as 0.6 percent to a level
higher than the 907.59 close on Dec. 30 last year. About eight
stocks advanced for every seven that fell.  “The yen is in a weakening trend against the backdrop of
gains in U.S. bond yields, so concerns the yen will appreciate
further are easing,” said  Katsuhiko Hiroshige , general manager
of equities research at Bansei Asset Management Co. “There’s no
reason to sell Japanese stocks.”  For the year, the Topix has slid 0.4 percent, compared with
gains of 11 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 8.9
percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Japanese
benchmark are  valued  at 15.7 times estimated earnings on average,
higher than the 14.5 times for the S&P 500 and 12.3 times for
the Stoxx 600.  Dollar Advances  Honda climbed 1.3 percent to 3,215 yen, its highest close
since April 30. Suzuki Motor Corp., a maker of automobiles and
motorcycles, rallied 1.2 percent to 2,055 yen, after Credit
Suisse Group AG initiated coverage of the company at
“outperform.”  Canon Inc. , the world’s largest maker of cameras
and which gets about 80 percent of its revenue outside Japan,
gained 1.2 percent to 4,145 yen.  The dollar appreciated to 84.51 against the yen, the
highest level since Sept. 24, after Moody’s Investors Service
put Spain’s debt rating on review for a possible downgrade and
as yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries advanced to a seven-month
high. A stronger dollar boosts the value of U.S. income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  “The situation is not bad for Japanese stocks,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million in assets in
Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  Manufacturing Increases  A gauge of manufacturing in the New York region rebounded
more than forecast in December. The Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s general economic index climbed to 10.6, exceeding the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Readings greater than zero signal expansion. Separate Fed data
showed U.S. industrial production increased 0.4 percent, topping
the 0.3 percent median gain forecast by economists in a survey.  “Some U.S. economic figures indicated a self-sustaining
recovery in the economy,” said  Takeshi Osawa , a senior fund
manager in Tokyo at Norinchukin Zenkyoren Asset Management Co.,
which oversees about $22 billion.  Banks were the  biggest support  for the Topix. Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group rose 2.2 percent to 2,856 yen and was the
most-actively traded stock by value in the Topix. Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., the nation’s largest bank by market value,
increased 1.4 percent to 435 yen. Nomura maintained a “buy”
rating on the banks, citing their low valuations. Sumitomo
Mitsui trades at 0.78 times book value, while Mitsubishi UFJ is
at 0.65 times book value.  Aozora Bank Ltd., the lender controlled by Cerberus Capital
Management LP, soared 7.8 percent to 165 yen, a level not seen
since September 2008, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rated the
company a “buy” in new coverage.  Dena  surged 9.9 percent to 2,975 yen, a level not seen
since its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in February 2005.
The company said it will provide its social-gaming platform to
Samsung Electronics for smart phones.  To contact the reporters on this story:
