Kenya lawmaker Isaac Ruto presented
a motion in parliament today calling for Kenya to repeal the
International Crimes Act, effectively ending the country’s
obligation to cooperate with the International Criminal Court.  Kenya Broadcasting Corp., the nation’s state-run television
station aired Ruto’s comments as part of a live broadcast of
parliamentary proceedings.  A copy of the motion on Kenya’s parliamentary website also
said repealing the act will ensure ‘any criminal investigations
or prosecutions arising out of the post election violence of
2007/2008 be undertaken under the framework of the new
constitution and that the government suspends any links,
cooperation and assistance to the International Criminal Court
forthwith.’  To contact the reporter on this story:
