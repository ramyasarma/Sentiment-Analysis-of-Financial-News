Accenture Plc , the second-largest
technology-consulting company, forecast sales for this quarter
and profit for the year that topped some analysts’  estimates , as
businesses boost spending on consulting projects.  Net revenue, or sales before reimbursements, will rise to
$5.6 billion to $5.8 billion for the fiscal second quarter
ending in February, the Dublin-based  company  said today in a
statement. Analysts estimated $5.62 billion on average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales climbed in the first quarter for the third
consecutive period, after more than a year of declines, as
corporations shift projects to the company. Consulting sales,
which account for almost 60 percent of total revenue, advanced
14 percent.  “There’s been a bit of inflection toward more consulting,
more discretionary projects for growth, rather than just cost-
cutting,” said  Darrin Peller , an analyst with Barclays Capital
in New York who rates the shares “overweight” and doesn’t own
them.  Fiscal first-quarter net income increased 20 percent to
$534.7 million, or 81 cents a share, from $444.8 million, or 67
cents, a year earlier.  Analysts  estimated 75 cents on average.  Per-share profit for the year ending in August will be
$3.08 to $3.16, compared with a previous forecast of as much as
$3.08. Analysts projected $2.99 on average. Net revenue for the
year ending in August will increase 8 percent to 11 percent, the
company said. In fiscal 2010, net revenue was $21.6 billion,
according to the company filings.  CEO Stepping Down  Accenture, which lags behind  International Business
Machines Corp.  in technology-consulting sales,  advanced  as much
as $1.23 to $47.90 in extended trading, after adding 57 cents to
$46.67 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have climbed 12 percent this year.  Chief Executive Officer  Bill Green  is stepping down Jan. 1
and will be replaced by  Pierre Nanterme , a 27-year company
veteran who runs the financial-services division, the company
said in October. Green will remain chairman, Accenture said.  First quarter net revenue climbed 6 percent to $6.05
billion, topping analysts’ average estimate of $5.79 billion.  (To hear a replay of Accenture’s conference call on results
