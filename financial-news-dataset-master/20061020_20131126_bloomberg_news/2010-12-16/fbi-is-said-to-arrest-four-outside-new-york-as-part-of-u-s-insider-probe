Four people were arrested today
outside New York by agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation as part of a long-term insider trading probe, a
person familiar with the matter said.  The charges are to be unsealed later today in Manhattan
federal court, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the matter isn’t public.  A fifth person was arrested in the same probe and pleaded
guilty, according to another person familiar with the situation,
who couldn’t be named because the matter hasn’t been made
public.  The arrests were the latest development in a probe by
prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney  Preet Bharara , the FBI’s New York office and the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  On Nov. 22, FBI agents from New York and Boston executed
search warrants at the offices of Level Global Investors LP and
Diamondback Capital Management LLC, firms founded by alumni of
SAC Capital Advisors LLC.  Agents that day also executed a search warrant at the
offices of Loch Capital Management. None of the firms or their
employees have been accused of any wrongdoing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
