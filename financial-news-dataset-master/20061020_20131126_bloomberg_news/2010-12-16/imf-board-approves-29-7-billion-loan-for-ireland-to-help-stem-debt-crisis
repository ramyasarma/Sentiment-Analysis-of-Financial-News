The International Monetary Fund said
it concluded the sales of 403.3 metric tons of gold, which it
had announced in September 2009.  “The gold sales were conducted under modalities to
safeguard against disruption of the gold market,” the IMF said
in a release today. “All gold sales were at market prices,
including direct sales to official holders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
