Foreigners bought a net C$9.51
billion ($9.46 billion) of Canadian securities in October, more
than half of which was corporate bonds, approaching an annual
record.  Foreign investors bought C$7.79 billion of bonds in
October, including C$5.1 billion of corporate debt and C$2.98
billion of provincials, while selling C$755 million of federal
government debt, Ottawa-based Statistics Canada said today. Non-
residents also bought C$2.96 billion of stocks, and their
holdings of money-market paper declined by C$1.24 billion.  Purchases are headed for a second straight annual record,
with the year-to-date total of C$97.8 billion greater than the
C$88.6 billion recorded in the same period of 2009. Foreign
purchases were a record C$110.9 billion last year. The buying
adds to demand for the Canadian dollar, which has traded for
close to parity with the U.S. dollar for most of this year.  Demand for the country’s bonds may be supported by Finance
Minister Jim Flaherty’s goal of balancing the government’s
budget by 2015-16, the first country in the Group of Seven to do
so. This contrasts with Europe’s fiscal crisis and a U.S.
 deficit  that was $1.294 trillion in the last fiscal year.  Year-to-date purchases of provincial and federal government
bonds have already exceeded annual records, Statistics Canada
said today.  Economists predicted a total C$10 billion net purchase of
Canadian securities, according to the median of three estimates
by Bloomberg News.  Canadians  bought  a net C$821 million of foreign securities
in October, led by money-market paper.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said the number of
people receiving jobless benefits fell 0.8 percent to 683,340 in
October from September. From the year-ago month, the number of
regular beneficiaries fell 14.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
