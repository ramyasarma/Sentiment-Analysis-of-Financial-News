Pfizer Inc.  said it set the annual
base salary and target bonus of Chief Executive Officer  Ian Read 
at $4.29 million, with additional payments in stock, options and
long-term incentive awards to be disclosed in March.  Read, named CEO on Dec. 5, was previously head of Pfizer’s
global pharmaceutical operations responsible for 85 percent of
company revenue. He will see a base salary increase of 40
percent, to $1.7 million from $1.21 million, the company said in
a filing. His bonus target more than doubled to $2.59 million,
from $1.16 million.  Read’s compensation figures don’t include stock, options
and long-term incentive pay, which will be disclosed in the next
proxy statement, typically filed in March, said  Joan Campion , a
spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer. Read, a 32-year veteran
of the company, received  compensation  valued at $9.45 million in
2009, the most recent year for which total awards have been
included in regulatory filings.  Over the next five years, Pfizer faces generic competition
to products with $20 billion in annual sales, or almost a third
of the company’s revenue. Pfizer is eliminating jobs and
reducing costs as it absorbs the $68 billion acquisition of
Wyeth last year. Pfizer’s former CEO,  Jeffrey Kindler , will
receive about $9.6 million in severance, bonus and short-term
incentive pay for 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
