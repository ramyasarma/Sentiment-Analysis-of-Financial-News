Crude oil fell from a one-week high
on speculation that cold weather in the U.S. may abate and
reduce demand for heating fuel.  Oil reversed yesterday’s gains after the Energy Department
said stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, increased 1.09 million barrels to 161.3
million. Normal or warmer-than-normal weather is likely in most
of the Northeast and Midwest from Dec. 25 to Dec. 29, according
to Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda, Maryland.  “It’s true that we have strong support from cold weather
but that will only last as long as the cold lasts,” said
 Christophe Barret , a London-based oil analyst at Credit Agricole
CIB. “The market is not tightening at all.”  Crude for January delivery fell as much as 68 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $87.94 a barrel and was at $88.16 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 1:08 p.m. London time. Brent crude oil
for January settlement was at $91.93 a barrel, down 27 cents, on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The January Brent
contract expires today. The more actively traded February
contract was down 33 cents at $91.82 a barrel.  Oil increased 34 cents in New York yesterday to $88.62 a
barrel, the highest settlement price since Dec. 7, after the
Energy Department said crude  inventories  fell 9.85 million
barrels last week to 346 million. Refiners  operated  at 88
percent of capacity, the most since September.  U.S. crude supplies were forecast to drop 2.5 million
barrels, a Bloomberg survey showed. The gain was limited as the
decline was concentrated on the Gulf Coast.  Inventories  at
Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for New York futures,
increased by 982,000 barrels to 35.9 million, the highest level
since August.  U.S. Weather  U.S. crude imports slipped to  7.69 million barrels  a day,
the report showed. Fuel imports dropped 11 percent to 2.36
million barrels a day.  Temperatures during the last week of December may be 5 to
10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than this week, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania.  Gasoline supplies  rose 809,000 barrels to 214.8 million
last week, the Energy Department report showed. They were
forecast to climb 2 million barrels, according to the median of
17 responses in the Bloomberg News survey. Stockpiles of
 distillate fuel , a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, increased 1.09 million barrels to 161.3 million.  Middle distillate supplies were “a bearish number
seasonally speaking,”  Stephen Schork , president of consultant
Schork Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said in a note to
clients. “Last year saw a 2.95 million-barrel draw.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
