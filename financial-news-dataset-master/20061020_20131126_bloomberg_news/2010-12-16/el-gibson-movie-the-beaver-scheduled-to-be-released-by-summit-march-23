Summit Entertainment LLC plans to
release “The Beaver,” a  Jodie Foster -directed film starring
 Mel Gibson , in March, more than eight months after purported
audio tirades by the actor complicated the studio’s plans.  The movie, about a man on a journey to reconcile with his
family, will open March 23 in a limited number of theaters and
expand to more on April 8, Los Angeles-based Summit, holder of
the film’s U.S. distribution rights, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “The Beaver” will be the first Gibson movie to reach
theaters since the rants, allegedly made by the actor to
girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, were made public in July. By then,
filming was complete and the movie was getting so-called post-
production touches, a person with knowledge of the situation
said at the time.  Gibson was accused of making anti-Semitic remarks to a Los
Angeles County Sheriff’s deputy in 2006. He served three years’
probation and attended court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous
meetings after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor drunk-
driving charge. His record was expunged last year, the
Associated Press reported at the time.  “The Beaver” was made for about $19 million, according to
 Internet Movie Database . “Edge of Darkness,” released in
January, cost about $80 million and generated $81 million in
worldwide ticket sales, according to researcher Box Office Mojo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
