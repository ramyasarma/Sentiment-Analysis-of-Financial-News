Konkola Copper Mines Plc, a Zambian
copper unit of  Vedanta Resources Plc , plans to double output by
2012 and invest $1 billion in the next three to four years.  Konkola plans to produce 400,000 metric tons of copper a
year by 2012, Chief Executive Officer  Kishore Kumar  said in an
e-mailed statement dated yesterday. The planned new investment
follows the $1.8 billion of spending by the company since 2004,
when Vedanta bought a 51 percent stake in Konkola.  Vedanta, controlled by billionaire  Anil Agarwal , last month
announced plans to list Konkola in London and Lusaka, raising
$1.1 billion through an initial public offering in 2011 to pay
debt and expand mines and exploration in Zambia. Konkola
produced 173,000 tons of copper last year.  “This country has huge copper resources and every part of
Zambia is good for investments,” Kumar said. “We have an
aggressive program for exploration in the next 2-3 years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
