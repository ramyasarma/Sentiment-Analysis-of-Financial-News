Serbia has chosen to index its new
Treasury bill issues to the euro this month, after preliminary
discussions with potential investors showed no appetite for
other types of indexation, the  Serbian Debt Agency  chief said.  The six-month T-bill issue worth 10 billion dinars ($127.24
million) is due to be auctioned on Dec. 22, with the settlement
two days after the sale, Branislav Toncic said in an interview
in Belgrade said. The government approved the measure at a
meeting today, he said.  “There’s no interest in the market for some more exotic
indexation forms,” he said. “Banks are looking for something
that will protect their capital. Depending on how it goes, the
government will decide on the size and the date of the next debt
issue at its session next week,”  Serbia has been struggling to borrow in the local market
since June, with most of its debt auctions undersold. Its last
auction of dinar-denominated six-month Treasury bills saw yields
rising to 13.69 percent.  Finance Minister  Diana Dragutinovic  told Bloomberg on Dec.
10 that the government was thinking of indexing the new debt to
inflation or the euro, the latter triggering euro-selling
activity in the foreign-exchange market and forcing the central
bank to buy euros for four consecutive days from banks.  The National Bank of Serbia has bought a total of 96
million euros from banks since Monday to curb the dinar gains
already at 2.6 percent since Monday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
