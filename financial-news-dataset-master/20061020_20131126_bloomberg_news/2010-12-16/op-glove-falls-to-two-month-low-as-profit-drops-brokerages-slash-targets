Top Glove Corp. , the world’s biggest
rubber-glove maker, fell the most in more than three years in
Kuala Lumpur as brokerages from HwangDBS Research Sdn. to UOB
Kay Hian Group cut their profit forecasts on higher costs and
slower demand.  The stock slid 6.1 percent to 5.12 ringgit at the 5 p.m.
close, its steepest drop since Aug. 16, 2007, the biggest
decliner on the 347-member  FTSE Bursa Malaysia EMAS Index  today.
Top Glove yesterday reported a 45 percent drop in fiscal first-
quarter net income.  “Demand remains soft and latex prices are at a record
high,”  Hon Seow Mee , an analyst at HwangDBS, said in a report
today. “Top Glove is being pressured by rising operating costs
given that 83 percent of its gloves are made from natural rubber
latex.” Hon lowered his share-price estimate to 4.60 ringgit
from 4.80 ringgit and fiscal 2011 earnings forecast by 9 percent.  The Klang, Selangor-based  company’s  shares surged 188
percent last year as global demand for medical rubber gloves
outstripped supply amid a wave of global flu scares. Demand is
now slowing as customers hold back on purchases in anticipation
of lower prices amid rising competition, UOB said in a report.  At least  seven brokerages  today cut their share estimates
for Top Glove to an average 4.69 ringgit, according to
calculations by Bloomberg. The range was between 3.66 ringgit
and 6.06 ringgit.  Forecasts Slashed  Net income  fell 45 percent to 36.1 million ringgit ($11.5
million) in its fiscal first quarter, the Malaysian company said
in an exchange filing yesterday. Average latex prices were 57
percent higher than a year ago, while the dollar was 9.3 percent
weaker against the ringgit, said Top Glove, which sells its
products in the U.S. currency.  RHB Research Institute Sdn. cut its price estimate to 4.10
ringgit from 5.40 ringgit while OSK Research Sdn. lowered its
forecast to 5.74 ringgit from 6.06 ringgit, reports said today.  UOB reduced its fiscal 2011 earnings estimate for Top Glove
by 25 percent, and 18 percent each for 2012 and 2013, it said in
a report today. UOB also cut its share estimate to 3.66 ringgit
from 5.02 ringgit.  “Demand is indeed slowing,” UOB said. Top Glove is facing
“difficulties passing on higher costs to customers as
manufacturers compete on pricing.”  Customers’ inventory holding period has fallen to one to
two months from an average of three to four months, UOB said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
