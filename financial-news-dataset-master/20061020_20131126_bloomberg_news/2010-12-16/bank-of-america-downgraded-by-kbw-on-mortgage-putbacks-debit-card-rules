Bank of America Corp.,  the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, was downgraded to “market perform” from
“outperform” by KBW Inc. because of costs tied to repurchasing
faulty mortgages and new rules on debit-card fees.  The bank may not raise its penny-a-share dividend until
2012, trailing other large U.S. lenders, KBW analysts led by
Jefferson Harralson wrote today in a research note. His estimate
for the company’s 2011 earnings per share is 71 cents, less than
half the $1.46 average of 30 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan
told analysts last week that he didn’t “see anything that would
stop us” from raising the payout next year. The firm’s shares
fell 18 percent this year, the second-worst performance in the
24-company KBW Bank Index, partly on concern that $4.4 billion
of reserves stockpiled for loan repurchases may not be enough.  “We do not expect significant earnings improvement in
2011, and we believe investors should move to the sidelines
until a better economy materializes,” Harralson wrote.  Repurchases may cost the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
lender $2 billion a quarter, Harralson wrote. Regulation on
debit-card fees will reduce earnings by 10 cents a share, he
wrote.  Bank of America has said it expects to set aside about $500
million each quarter for the next few years to cover buyback
demands from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as bond
insurers and private investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
