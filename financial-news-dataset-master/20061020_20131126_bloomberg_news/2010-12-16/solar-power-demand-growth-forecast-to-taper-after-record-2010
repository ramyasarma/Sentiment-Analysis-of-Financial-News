Global demand for solar power cells
will increase 25 percent next year after more than doubling to a
record this year, according to industry publisher Solarbuzz.  Solar manufacturers will deliver 20,400 megawatts to
customers next year, up from an estimated 16,300 megawatts this
year, San Francisco-based Solarbuzz said today in a  report .  Demand for solar energy has soared as governments seek to
reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and cut emissions of
greenhouse gases by power plants. A rapid expansion of solar
panel production, mostly in Asia, has helped to reduce the cost
of solar power in the U.S. to an average of $3.47 per watt in
this month, compared with $4.77 in December 2007, according to
 Solarbuzz surveys .  “The large price reductions of 2009 created the platform
for spectacular growth,” Solarbuzz President Craig Stevens said
in the report. “They will need to fall further than incentive
tariffs in key world markets to maintain strong growth next
year.”  Reductions in government incentives for solar energy in
Germany and the Czech Republic were the main factors in
estimating slower growth next year, Stevens said.  Chinese manufacturers including  JA Solar Holdings Co. , the
top cell maker in the third quarter, produced 51 percent of
solar deliveries in the third quarter, up from 47 percent a year
earlier. China’s  Suntech Power Holdings Co . was the second
biggest and Tempe, Arizona-based  First Solar Inc . was third.
Total revenue from solar panel sales climbed 74 percent in the
third quarter to $17.9 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
