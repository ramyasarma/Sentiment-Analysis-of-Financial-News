Cocoa rose in New York as street
protests following Ivory Coast’s disputed presidential election
spilled over into violence, threatening to disrupt exports from
the world’s top producer.  Ivory Coast’s opposition coalition said 15 of its
supporters were killed today in clashes with security forces in
the commercial capital, Abidjan. Cocoa prices in New York have
climbed 8.1 percent since the runoff election on Nov. 28.  “People’s focus is on the Ivory Coast as the political
situation is delicate and tensions are running very high,”
 Jonathan Parkman , joint-head of the agriculture division at
Marex Financial Ltd. in London, said by phone today. “Cocoa
prices are reacting as any escalation into a long-term conflict
would threaten supply.”  Cocoa for March delivery gained $41, or 1.4 percent, to
$3,020 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York at 1:39 p.m.
London-time, extending its advance this week to 4.6 percent.
Cocoa for March delivery added 22 pounds, or 1.1 percent, to
2,020 pounds ($3,156) a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Troops loyal to  Laurent Gbagbo  used live ammunition and
tear gas to disperse his opponent  Alassane Ouattara’s  supporters
who are marching to force Gbagbo to quit as president, Amadou
Coulibaly, a spokesman for the group that supports Ouattara,
said by phone today.  Cocoa delivered into the December futures contract in
London was 109,960 metric tons,  NYSE Liffe  said yesterday. That
compared with 29,910 tons delivered into the September contract
and 240,100 tons into the July contract, the most since 1996,
according to the exchange.  Sugar Rises  Armajaro Holdings Ltd., a London-based commodities trader
and hedge-fund group, took delivery of that July cocoa, the
Financial Times reported July 16, citing unidentified traders.
