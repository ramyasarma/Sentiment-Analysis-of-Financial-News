BAA (SP) Ltd., owner of London’s
Heathrow and Stansted airports, raised its full-year earnings
forecast as traffic increased.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
and one-time gains or costs will exceed 972 million pounds ($1.5
billion) this year and rise a further 15 percent next year, the
London-based company said today in a statement. Revenue in 2011
will advance 11 percent to 2.3 billion pounds.  Airlines are adding destinations from Heathrow, Europe’s
busiest airport, and increasing flights on existing routes as
travel recovers from the global recession. BAA, which is owned
by Spanish construction company  Ferrovial SA , is forecasting
that Heathrow’s passengers next year will exceed 70 million for
the first time. The airport operator predicted on Oct. 27 that
adjusted Ebitda in 2010 would be at least 956 million pounds.  Eleven-month traffic at Heathrow, the main hub of British
Airways Plc, increased 0.6 percent from a year earlier to 60.9
million passengers, while the figure at Stansted, where  Ryanair
Holdings Plc  has a base, declined 6.7 percent to 17.3 million,
BAA said on Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
