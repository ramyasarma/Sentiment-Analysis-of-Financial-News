OAO Rosneft , Russia’s largest oil
producer, may invite a strategic foreign investor to buy shares
in the next five years after seeking to increase its market
value as much as two-thirds.  The company may seek a strategic partner as the government
plans to cut its holding in 2014 or 2105, Rosneft Chief
Executive Officer  Eduard Khudainatov  said yesterday in Istanbul,
according to a statement posted today on the company’s  website .  Russia’s government is planning 1 trillion rubles ($32.5
billion) of asset sales in the next three years to help close a
budget deficit. By 2015, a 15 percent stake in Rosneft may be
sold and 10 percent minus one share offered for asset swaps, the
Economy Ministry said on its website in November.  Rosneft aims to boost its market value, which is now about
a third of what it ought to be, before a sale, Khudainatov said
in the statement. “Look at how much Exxon and BP are worth.”  Rosneft shares fell 0.5 percent today to 217.79 rubles at
3:05 p.m. in Moscow, extending its decline this year to 14
percent and giving it a market value of about $75 billion.  Exxon
Mobil Corp.’s  shares have risen 5.4 percent this year, boosting
its market value to $362 billion.  Rosneft shares are “a sort of ticket” for possible access
to reserves in Russia,  Ildar Davletshin , an oil and gas analyst
at Renaissance Capital, said by e-mail today.  BP Plc  bought $1 billion of shares during Rosneft’s 2006
initial public offering. Petroliam Nasional Bhd., Malaysia’s
state oil company known as Petronas, spent $1.1 billion and
 China National Petroleum Corp . spent $500 million in the $10.6
billion sale.  No Plans to Sell  Petronas has yet to see benefits from its purchase,
Davletshin said. It may want to keep its options open, he said.
BP gets about a quarter of output and a fifth of reserves come
from Russia, through its TNK-BP venture, set up in 2003 with a
group of billionaires. Last year China agreed to lend $25
billion to Rosneft and OAO Transneft, the oil pipeline operator,
and will get about 300,000 barrels a day of crude for 20 years.  BP has no plans to sell Rosneft shares,  Vladimir Buyanov , a
Moscow-based spokesman for the company, said today. BP is
selling mature assets after a spill at its Macondo well in the
Gulf of Mexico left it facing a bill projected to reach $40
billion. The oil company said in July it was planning to sell
$30 billion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
