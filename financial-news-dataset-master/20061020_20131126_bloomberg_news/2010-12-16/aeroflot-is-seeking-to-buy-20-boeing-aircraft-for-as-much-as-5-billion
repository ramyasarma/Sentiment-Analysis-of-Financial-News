OAO Aeroflot, Russia’s largest
airline, plans to buy as many as 20 long-range aircraft from
Boeing Co. to expand its fleet before the 2014 Winter Olympics
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.  State-run Aeroflot signed an agreement of intent this week
to buy eight B777-200ER and eight B777-300ER aircraft and may
seek to acquire four B787 Dreamliners, said Irina Dannenberg, a
spokeswoman for the Moscow-based company, by phone today,
