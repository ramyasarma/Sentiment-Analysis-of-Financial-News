Mark Anthony Longoria, the former
employee of  Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  charged in a U.S.
insider-trading probe, was released on $50,000 bail approved by
a federal judge in Austin, Texas.  Longoria was released today after a hearing before U.S.
Magistrate Judge  Andrew Austin , according to Julie Golden, a
deputy for the judge. All further appearances will be in New
York, Golden said.  “He’s been cooperating with the investigation, and he
intends to continue to cooperate with the investigation,” Sam
Bassett, Longoria’s lawyer, said today in a phone interview.
Bassett declined to describe Longoria’s cooperation with the
government, other than to say it had been ongoing for “several
weeks.”  Longoria, 44, is accused of providing inside information
about AMD to clients of  Primary Global Research LLC , a
consulting company in Mountain View, California, that provides
experts to investors. He was one of four people arrested today
in a nationwide investigation of illegal trading at hedge funds
by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The case is U.S. v. Shimoon, 10-02823, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
