KSK Energy Ventures Ltd. , an Indian
power project developer, plans to buy 250 megawatts of wind
turbines from China’s  Dongfang Electric Corp.  to use at its wind
farms.  The companies signed a contract this week during a visit by
Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  to New Delhi, KSK Energy said in an
e-mailed statement.  The Hyderabad-based company plans to increase its wind
power capacity almost six-fold to 300 megawatts by 2011 from 52
megawatts currently. The company, a unit of London-listed  KSK
Power Ventur Plc , is also looking at opportunities to develop
offshore wind farms, it said.  Its 18.9-megawatt wind farm in the southern state of Tamil
Nadu will be completed “shortly,” it said. The company is also
obtaining permits for a 50-megawatt project in Andhra Pradesh
and land for 250 megawatts of capacity in Karnataka.  To contact the reporter on this story:
