(Corrects price of shares for local investors in second
paragraph.)  EDL-Generation Pcl plans to raise as
much as 930.5 billion kip ($115.4 million) in the first public
offering in  Laos  as the smallest economy in Southeast Asia
prepares to permit trading on its new stock exchange.  The unit of state-owned  Electricite du Laos  is offering
about 86.9 million shares to foreign investors and 119.4 million
shares to local investors at 4,300 kip apiece, according to the
prospectus filed to the Office of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The company will offer about 10.9 million shares to
employees at 4,000 kip per share, the terms show.  The shares will begin trading next month when the Laos
Securities Exchange, established in October, begins trading
operations, the prospectus said. Lao Securities Exchange is 51
percent owned by the Laotian government and 49 percent held by
Korea Exchange Inc., the operator of South Korea’s bourse.  Landlocked Laos is seeking global investors to help pay for
infrastructure projects and create jobs for its 7 million
citizens, nearly half of whom are younger than 16.  Rio Tinto
Group  and  Electricite de France SA  are among companies that have
boosted investments in mines and power plants to tap into the
nation’s rivers and other natural resources.  Proceeds from the public offering will be used to fund the
development of new power projects and the maintenance of
existing generation assets, which have a total installed
capacity of 387 megawatts, the statement said.  EDL-Generation’s share offering is scheduled to run from
today to Dec. 24, the statement said. Bangkok-based KT Zmico
Securities Co., through its Laotian unit BCEL Krungthai
Securities, is financial adviser to the share offering and BCEL
Krungthai is the underwriter of the issue, the prospectus said.  Earnings Projected  The company is projected to generate 292.9 billion kip of
net profit this year, which will probably jump to 550 billion
next year, according to the prospectus. Total assets are
estimated at 4.5 trillion kip this year, which may rise to 4.6
trillion in 2011, the statement said.  Laos’s economy may expand 7.5 percent in 2011 from an
estimated 7.4 percent this year and a 5.5 percent pace in 2009,
boosted by electricity sales to Thailand and higher prices of
copper, gold and silver, the Asian Development Bank said in a
 report  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
