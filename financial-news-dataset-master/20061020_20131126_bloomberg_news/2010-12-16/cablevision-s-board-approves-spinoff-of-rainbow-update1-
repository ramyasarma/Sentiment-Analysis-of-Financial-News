Cablevision Systems Corp. , the New
York-area cable-television provider, will spin off its Rainbow
unit, which includes cable channels Sundance, IFC and AMC, the
broadcaster of “Mad Men.”  The unit will be spun off to Cablevision’s shareholders as
a “tax-free pro rata distribution,” the Bethpage, New York-
based company said today in a statement. The plan calls for a
completion of the transaction in mid-year 2011. Last month, the
company announced its board was considering a spinoff.  The split lets Chief Executive Officer  Jim Dolan  focus on
the company’s telecommunications operation, which accounted for
94 percent of its operating income last quarter. Cablevision
spun off its Madison Square Garden unit and related sports
networks earlier this year. Simplifying the business will help
boost market value by separating units that depend on ad revenue
and make it easier if the Dolan family decides to take the
company private or sell it.  Cablevision said in the statement it isn’t considering the
sale of Rainbow or its cable and telecommunications business.  Cablevision rose 3 cents to $34.72 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The stock had added 20 percent
since the company announced it was considering a spinoff on Nov.
