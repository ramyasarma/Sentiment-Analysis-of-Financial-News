The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corp.,
a government agency that liquidates failed banks, is seeking an
amendment of its laws to give it more powers to punish those
responsible for future bank failures,  BusinessDay  reported.  The insurer wants to force such bankers to operate properly
or be removed from their positions, the Lagos-based newspaper
said, citing the NDIC’s acting managing director, Umaru Ibrahim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
