Iran’s Interior Minister Mostafa
Mohammad-Najjar said the “terrorists” who carried out the bomb
attacks yesterday received training in Pakistan.  “A group of terrorists who are unfortunately being trained
on the other side of our eastern borders, in Pakistan, committed
this terrorist act,” he said, cited by the state-run Islamic
Republic News Agency.  At least 38 people were killed in two bombings outside a
mosque in Iran’s southeastern city of Chabahar during the annual
Shiite Muslim ceremonies of Ashura, the agency said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
