The value of illegally downloaded
music in the U.K. will be worth 1 billion pounds ($1.56 billion)
this year, as the practice proliferates and slows growth of the
digital music market.  An estimated 7.7 million U.K. Internet users illegally
download music on a regular basis, meaning musicians,
songwriters and music companies receive no payments, according
to the Digital Music Nation 2010 report from the  British
Recorded Music Industry  trade organization.  Though the U.K. boasts 67 legal online music services, more
than any other country, there is no effective deterrent to
obtaining music illegally, BPI said. The music industry is
lobbying government to implement the Digital Economy Act, passed
earlier this year and designed to curb illegal file sharing by
requiring Internet service providers to block some users.  Digital music growth in the U.K. “is a fraction of what it
ought to be,” BPI Chief Executive Officer  Geoff Taylor  said in
a statement.  Illegal downloading “is a parasite that threatens to
deprive a generation of talented young people of their chance to
make a career in music and is holding back investment in the
fledgling digital entertainment sector,” he said.  Digital services now account for 24.5 percent of U.K.
record industry revenue, BPI said, from 19.2 percent a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
