Biofuels, vaccines and products
under development in the emerging field of synthetic biology
should receive coordinated oversight from the U.S. government, a
presidential commission said.  That scrutiny should include an assessment of risks posed
by the technology before products are tested outside a
laboratory, the  Presidential Commission for the Study of
Bioethical Issues  said today in a report. Synthetic biology
refers to lab engineering techniques that artificially create
DNA to assemble organisms with novel or enhanced qualities.  Genome pioneer  J. Craig Venter  announced in May that his
nonprofit institute in Rockville, Maryland, had replaced the
genetic structure of one bacterium with the DNA of another.
While the development was hailed by scientists for its potential
to make vaccines, drugs and biofuels, it also sparked fears that
microbes may be used as weapons or inadvertently released.
President  Barack Obama  then  asked  the panel to study the risks
and benefits of the technology.  The commission “struck a middle course between unfettered,
or what I call ‘let it rip’ science and a precautionary
approach” that would have placed a moratorium on new research,
 Amy Gutmann , president of the University of Pennsylvania and
head of the bioethics commission, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. The panel sought to be forward-looking because “this
science is in its infancy,” she said.  Companies and Products  Companies using synthetic biology include  Amyris Inc.  in
Emeryville, California, which is developing renewable biofuels
and an antimalarial drug, and  Synthetic Genomics Inc. , a closely
held San Diego-based company founded by Venter, best known for
leading a private effort to map the human genome.  Exxon Mobil
Corp ., the biggest U.S. oil company, has  pledged  more than $600
million in funding to Venter’s company to make fuels from algae.  The panel called on the government to develop a “clear,
defined and coordinated approach” to synthetic biology,
according to a 188-page report released today. The
recommendations balance the benefits, such as new malaria
treatments, with the “still distant risks posed by the field,”
Gutmann said.  The bioethics commission rejected the idea that the
evolving field amounts to creating life, as some opponents have
argued, Gutmann said.  “The feat does not constitute the creation of life, the
likelihood of which still remains remote for the foreseeable
future,” the commission report concluded.  The report “strikes a good balance overall,” said Gregory
Kaebnick, a scholar at the  Hastings Center , a bioethics research
group in Garrison, New York, who testified before the panel.
Still, the commission should have recommended a moratorium on
testing outside the laboratory, he said.  The panel’s recommendations were “deeply flawed” and
overly favored business interests, Friends of the Earth, an
environmental group based in Washington, said today in a  letter 
to the commission.  “These recommendations give industry a free pass, while
failing to ensure that the environment and public health are
protected,” said Eric Hoffman, a policy campaigner for Friends
of the Earth, in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
