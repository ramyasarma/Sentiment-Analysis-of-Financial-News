Houston Rockets center  Yao Ming  was
diagnosed with a stress fracture in his left ankle and there is
no timetable for his return to the National Basketball
Association team, the Rockets said.  Out since Nov. 10 because of what was said to have been a
bone bruise in his surgically repaired ankle, the fracture to
Yao’s medial malleolus was detected while rehabilitating the
injury, the Rockets said in an e-mailed news release.  The fracture is related to the one that caused the 7-foot-6
Yao to miss all of last season after having surgery in July
2009, the team said. That operation included a bone graft and
additional procedures to change the alignment of the foot and
reduce stress on the repaired bone.  Yao, 30, an All-Star in each of the seven NBA seasons he’s
played, was in five games this season for the Rockets (10-15),
averaging 10.2 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. Despite his
limited play, he was the leading vote-getter among Western
Conference centers in initial balloting for the 2011 NBA All-
Star Game, released earlier today by the league.  To contact the reporter on this story:
