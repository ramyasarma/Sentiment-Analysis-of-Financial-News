Treasuries snapped a two-day drop,
and commodities fell before European Union leaders meet to
discuss the region’s debt crisis and the U.S. publishes data
that may show jobless claims rose.  Ten-year Treasury yields retreated six basis points to 3.48
percent as of 5:35 p.m. in Tokyo after climbing 26 basis points
over the past two days.  Copper  dropped 0.8 percent, erasing most
of its rally for the week, and oil slipped 0.6 percent. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index sank 0.4 percent, set for its first two-day
loss in three weeks, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.2
percent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures were little changed.  The euro dropped 1.2 percent against the dollar yesterday
as Spain goes into its final bond sale of the year and EU
leaders start a summit in Brussels amid widening divisions on
how to contain the debt contagion. Data today may show U.S.
 housing starts  rose in November while more workers filed for
jobless benefits last week, supporting the Federal Reserve’s
decision to maintain record stimulus to boost an economy that
isn’t growing fast enough to spur employment.  “Economic numbers coming out of the U.S. are encouraging,
but investors are still worried about jobs,” said  Geoff Howie, 
a market strategist at MF Global Singapore Ltd., part of the
world’s largest broker of exchange-traded futures and options.
“A blowout in Europe is not going to help keep the U.S.
recovery on track.”  Bonds snapped a two-day drop that sent  yields  on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note to 3.56 percent yesterday, the
highest since May 13.  Jobs, Housing Starts  A Labor Department  report  today may show the number of
workers filing first-time claims for unemployment insurance
payments rose to 425,000 last week from 421,000, according to
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Separately, the Commerce
Department may say U.S. housing starts rose to a 550,000 annual
rate in November from 519,000 in October, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The dollar traded at $1.3232 per euro from $1.3214
yesterday and fetched 84.15 yen from 84.24. The European shared
currency fetched 111.35 yen from 111.37 yen, after dropping 0.5
percent yesterday when Moody’s said it may cut its credit rating
for Spain, which is due to offer 4.85 percent notes due 2020 and
4.65 percent 15-year bonds today. Portuguese government bonds
declined yesterday as costs rose at a sale of 3-month bills.  EU leaders are near an accord on a crisis-management tool
to contain future debt shocks that will take effect in 2013,
even as Germany balked at boosting or making more flexible use
of the region’s 750 billion-euro ($1 trillion) emergency fund.
The strife is marring confidence in Europe’s handling of the
fiscal woes that forced Greece and Ireland to fall back on
financial handouts.  Spain’s Challenges  “Spain is the linchpin for 2011,”  Russ Koesterich , head
of investment strategy for scientific active equities at
BlackRock Inc. in San Francisco, told Bloomberg Television.
“Spain is much larger than Greece, Ireland or Portugal, and if
Spain starts to run into real fiscal challenges, the existing
mechanisms in Europe aren’t big enough to deal with that.”  Copper for three-month delivery fell to $9,026 a metric ton
on the London Metal Exchange, trimming its gain this week to 0.4
percent. The contract reached a record $9,267.50 on Dec. 14
after China refrained from raising interest rates to curb
inflation. Crude oil traded at $88.31 a barrel in New York, near
a one-week high, after a U.S. Energy Department report showed
stockpiles declined the most since 2002 and refiners boosted
fuel output in the world’s biggest crude consumer.  Japan, Vietnam  Three stocks fell for every two that gained on the  MSCI
Asian index , which pared its 2010 rally to 11 percent. Japan’s
Topix index rose as much as 0.6 percent, briefly erasing its
losses for the year, before paring today’s advance to 0.2
percent. Vietnam’s VN Index was the region’s worst performer
today, tumbling 2.7 percent after Moody’s Investors Service
lowered the country’s credit rating.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index  fluctuated
after India’s central bank kept benchmark interest rates
unchanged following six increases this year, a decision
predicted by all 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The gauge
climbed as much as 0.5 percent before paring most of its gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
