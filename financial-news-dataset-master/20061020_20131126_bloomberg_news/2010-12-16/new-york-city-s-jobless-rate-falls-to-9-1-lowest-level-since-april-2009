New York City’s jobless rate fell to
its lowest level since April 2009 last month as hiring in
professional services, education and health care helped lead to
a gain of 51,200 jobs in the past year.  The city’s unemployment rate dropped to 9.1 percent last
month on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 9.2 percent in
October, the state  Department of Labor  said today. The rate was
8.9 percent in April 2009 and reached 10.5 percent in November
of that year.  Statewide,  the seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to  8.3
percent , after the Labor Department revised its October level to
8.2 percent from an earlier estimate of 8.3 percent.  City private-sector employment increased by 1.6 percent
over the 12 months ending in November, to about 3.2 million,
primarily in professional services, education, health care,
tourism and transportation. Financial-services employment
increased by 5,900 during that period, mostly in credit-granting
and real estate, the department reported.  “By historical standards, these numbers are quite
strong,”  James Brown , a Labor Department economist, said in a
telephone interview. “Gains over the year are quite broad with
losses only in manufacturing and publishing and information.
It’s the result of national economic growth in industries where
the city is strongest.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
