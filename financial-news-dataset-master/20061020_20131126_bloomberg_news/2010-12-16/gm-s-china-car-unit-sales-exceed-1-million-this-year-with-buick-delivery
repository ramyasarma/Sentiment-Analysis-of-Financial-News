General Motors Co .’s passenger-car
venture in China sold its millionth unit this year, becoming the
first carmaker to reach that sales level in the world’s largest
auto market.  The company delivered the car, a Buick Lacrosse, to its
buyer in Shanghai this month, GM’s Chinese partner  SAIC Motor
Corp.  said in a statement posted on its website yesterday.  GM, the biggest U.S. automaker, said last month it expects
to sell as many as 2.3 million vehicles, including minivans, in
China this year and for sales to increase as much as 15 percent
in 2011. China is the largest market by unit sales for the
Detroit-based automaker.  China’s passenger-car deliveries to dealers rose 29 percent
to 1.34 million in November as customers rushed to take
advantage of government incentives supporting vehicle-buying
that may expire at the end of the year, according to figures
from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  -- Tian Ying . Editors:  Chua Kong Ho ,  Lena Lee .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
