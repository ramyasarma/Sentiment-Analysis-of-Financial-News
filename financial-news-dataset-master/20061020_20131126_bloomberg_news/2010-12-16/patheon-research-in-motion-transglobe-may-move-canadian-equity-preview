Canadian stocks  rose for the first
time in four days as Research In Motion Ltd. advanced on its
profit and sales forecast and Teck Resources Ltd. gained on
higher copper prices.  Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, was
the biggest contributor as the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite
Index  advanced 0.2 percent. Teck, the country’s biggest base-
metal producer, rose 3.9 percent as copper rose for a third
straight week. Bank of Montreal, Canada’s fourth-largest lender,
slid 6.5 percent after agreeing to buy Milwaukee-based Marshall
& Ilsley Corp. for about $4.1 billion.  The  S&P/TSX  rose 20.23 points to 13,201.46 in Toronto, with
Teck and RIM accounting for about 14 points of the advance. The
main benchmark for Canadian equities still fell 0.3 percent
since Dec. 10, its first  weekly  decline this month, after
closing at a 27-month high on Dec. 13.  “The market has been betting for some time that RIM had
lost its technological edge,” said  Sebastian Van Berkom ,
president of Van Berkom & Associates Inc. in Montreal, which
manages C$1.4 billion, mainly in small and medium-sized company
shares. The shares “got down to a really low multiple because
of that.”  RIM, the 13th-largest company by weight in the S&P/TSX,
gained 1.8 percent to C$60.69. Third-quarter profit excluding
some items was $1.76 a share, beating the average of analyst
estimates by 6.7 percent.  Forecast  Revenue this quarter will be $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion
and earnings per share will be $1.74 to $1.80, Waterloo,
Ontario-based RIM said. Analysts projected revenue of $5.46
billion and profit of $1.61 a share.  RIM  is counting on a new version of the BlackBerry Bold and
the Torch, which has a slide-out keyboard and better Internet
browser, to lure customers away from Apple Inc.’s iPhone. RIM is
also tapping demand in markets such as Brazil and Indonesia for
less expensive models like the Curve, which incorporate its free
instant messaging system, to fend off the challenge from a slew
of new phones based on Google Inc.’s Android software.  Teck Resources  rose 3.9 percent to $58.39. Copper rose
today as European Union leaders agreed on a plan to contain
future debt crises and economic reports in the U.S. and Germany
bolstered prospects for metal demand.  Bank of Montreal fell 6.5 percent to $58. It will raise
about C$800 million in shares to help finance the purchase of
Marshall & Ilsley, the largest takeover ever for the Canadian
bank.  The acquisition is the third-largest by a Canadian bank or
insurer in the U.S., ranking behind  Manulife Financial Corp.’s 
$10.9 billion purchase of John Hancock Financial Services Inc.
in 2003 and Toronto-Dominion Bank’s $8.3 billion deal for
Commerce Bancorp Inc. in 2007, Bloomberg data shows.  2013 Benefit  The transaction will add to earnings in 2013, excluding
merger costs of C$540 million, Bank of Montreal said.  Canada’s biggest bank, Royal Bank of Canada, slid 0.7
percent to C$51.50. Bank of Nova Scotia retreated 0.4 percent to
$56.60.  Financial companies are the second-worst performing
industry in the S&P/TSX this year, returning 4.9 percent
compared with an index gain of 12 percent. They may be among the
best-performing next year as the economy improves and dividends
are restored, Van Berkom said.  Onex Corp.  rose 0.9 percent to C$29.18. Canada’s largest
private-equity firm is in talks to sell its Husky Injection
Molding Systems unit to rival buyout firms and may reap as much
as $2 billion, said people with direct knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
