Aluminum may advance as much as 29
percent to $3,000 a metric ton next year as record copper prices
spur end-users to use the light metal as an alternative, said a
partner at Tokyo-based research company Market Risk Advisory.  Substitution will boost global demand by 6.9 percent to
40.1 million tons in 2011 from this year, narrowing a worldwide
surplus to 200,000 tons from 1 million tons,  Naohiro Niimura 
said in an interview in Tokyo yesterday. Demand is forecast to
surpass production by 300,000 tons in 2012, creating a global
shortage for the first time in six years, he said.  Copper climbed to a record $9,267.50 a ton on Dec. 14 and
has gained 22 percent this year as China-led demand outpaces
supply. Aluminum has retreated about 7.5 percent from a two-year
high of $2,500 a ton on Nov. 11. The widening price gap
encourages companies such as Japanese cable maker  Furukawa
Electric Co.  to increase aluminum consumption.  “Aluminum will likely benefit from copper’s rally as
substitution may accelerate,” said Niimura, who worked about 10
years in commodity derivative sales at  Mizuho Financial Group ’s
Mizuho Corporate Bank, Barclays Capital and Deutsche Securities
before starting his company this year.  Furukawa Electric plans to produce aluminum wire harnesses
in Southeast Asia for Japanese carmakers in the year beginning
April, spokesman Masahiko Fukumoto said. The new product, more
than 40 percent lighter than copper-based wire harnesses, will
increase fuel-efficiency, he said by phone yesterday.  Shipments of aluminum wires increased 48 percent on year to
42,900 tons in the year ended March 31, while shipments of
copper-based products fell 13 percent to 662,500 tons, according
to the Japanese Electric Wire & Cable Makers’  Association .  China Demand  Global aluminum demand is forecast to increase 6.2 percent
to 42.6 million tons in 2012, exceeding expected output of 42.3
million tons, according to Niimura. The market has had a surplus
since 2007 on capacity expansion by smelters in China, Russia
and the Middle East.  Aluminum output in China, the world’s largest producer, is
expected to grow 8 percent to 14.8 million tons in 2011 from
this year, falling short of demand estimated at 15.9 million
tons, Niimura said. Chinese smelters will have difficulty
catching up with domestic demand as the government restricts
electricity supply to the energy-intensive industry.  Growth in Chinese demand may be curbed next year if the
government tightens its monetary policy to curb inflation,
Niimura said. The Chinese central bank has raised rates once
since December 2007, pushing the benchmark one-year deposit rate
to 2.5 percent and the lending rate to 5.56 percent. Next year
the bank may increase rates gradually by a total of 1 percentage
point, he said.  Consumer prices  jumped 5.1 percent in November.  ETF Influence  Aluminum demand will also increase next year as exchange-
traded funds backed by the metal are expected to become
available to investors, Niimura said.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest producer, said the
possible launch of aluminum exchange-traded funds in 2011 may
lock 2 to 3 million tons of the metal for “several years,”
according to a statement filed to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Alcoa Inc ., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, supports
the creation of an exchange-traded fund backed by the metal and
would be interested in supplying aluminum for such a product,
Chief Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  said last month.  Copper for three-month delivery in London may advance to as
high as $11,000 a ton next year as global consumption is
expected to outpace output by 300,000 tons, led by Chinese
infrastructure building and auto demand, Niimura said.  Global copper demand is expected to grow 4.8 percent to
19.5 million tons next year, while production is forecast to
increase 2.1 percent to 19.2 million, Niimura said.  The deficit may narrow to 200,000 tons in 2012 as
production is forecast to increase 5.2 percent, faster than the
4.6 percent growth in consumption, he said.  Aluminum for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange traded at $2,313 a ton at 5:04 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
