Builders in the U.S. began work on
more homes in November for the first time in three months,
showing the industry is struggling to recover.  Housing starts rose to a 555,000 annual rate, up 3.9 percent
from October’s 534,000 pace that was higher than initially
estimated, Commerce Department figures showed today in
Washington. The  median  estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called
for a 550,000 pace. Building  permits , a proxy of future work,
fell, reflecting a drop in applications for multifamily projects.  Companies like  Toll Brothers Inc.  anticipate the industry
that triggered the worst recession since the 1930s will regain
its footing in coming months after the end of a tax credit caused
demand to slump. While low  borrowing costs  and prices may help
entice buyers, mounting foreclosures and  unemployment  near 10
percent mean housing will take years to fully rebound.  “The housing recovery is fragile at this point,” Michelle
Meyer, a senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Global Research in New York, said before the report. “Demand
remains very weak for new houses. Builders are competing with
distressed properties so construction remains depressed.”  The median forecast was based on a survey of 76 economists.
Estimates ranged from 520,000 to 595,000.  Permits dropped 4 percent to a 530,000 annual rate, the
lowest level since April 2009. They were projected to climb to a
560,000 annual rate, according to the survey median.  Current-Account Gap  Another Commerce Department report today showed the current-
account deficit widened to $127.2 billion in the third quarter,
reflecting an increase in imports. The  gap , the broadest measure
of international trade because it includes income payments and
government transfers, was the biggest in almost two years.  From the same month last year, housing starts fell 5.8
percent, while permits were 15 percent lower.  Construction of single-family houses increased 6.9 percent
to a 465,000 rate, the highest level since April. While permits
also rose, by 3 percent, the 416,000 level of applications in
November signals work may slow in coming months.  Work on multi-family homes, such as townhouses and apartment
builders, dropped 9.1 percent to an annual rate of 90,000, a
third consecutive decline and the lowest level since June.
Multifamily permits plunged 23 percent to a 114,000 pace.  Three of four regions showed an increase, led by a 16
percent increase in the Midwest.  Americans have pulled back on house purchases following the
expiration of a tax incentive of as much as $8,000, which
required that contracts be signed by April 30 and closed by Sept.
30. Sales of  new  and existing properties fell in October. Figures
for November are due next week.  Fed’s Concerns  Today’s report is a reminder why Federal Reserve policy
makers, who met Dec. 14 for the final time this year, say housing
is lagging while the economy rebounds. They cited declines in
home values as one of the constraints on consumer spending.  “The housing sector continues to be depressed,” Fed
officials said in a statement after the gathering, at which they
reiterated a plan to expand record monetary stimulus and said
economic growth is “insufficient to bring down unemployment.”  Home values are poised to drop by more than $1.7 trillion
in 2010, according to Zillow Inc., a closely held provider of
home price data. This year’s estimated decline, more than the
$1.05 trillion drop in 2009, brings the loss since the June 2006
home-price peak to $9 trillion, Seattle-based Zillow said on
Dec. 9.  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo’s
 confidence  index was unchanged in December from a month earlier,
a report showed yesterday, indicating developers remained
pessimistic.  Builder Outlook  Even so, the housing market will avoid a double-dip after
reaching a bottom last year, and the industry will gain momentum
in 2012, according to Douglas Yearley, chief executive officer of
Toll Brothers, the largest U.S. luxury-home builder.  “The recovery is here to stay,” Yearley said in a Dec. 7
interview in New York. “I think 2011 will be an improving year,
but I think 2012 will be a big year for us.”  While the number of visitors to its sales offices isn’t up,
Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Toll is seeing more “quality”
visitors, a sign buyers are less skittish about the market and
more serious about purchasing, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
