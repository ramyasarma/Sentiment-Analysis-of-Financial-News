Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  dismissed as “nonexistent” a new political alliance
unveiled by former ally  Gianfranco Fini  and opposition centrist
parties, Corriere della Sera reported, citing the premier.  Fini and  Pier Ferdinando Casini , leader of the Union of
Centrists party, announced an agreement yesterday to form a
temporary political grouping along with more than 100 lawmakers.
The move came a day after Berlusconi survived a no-confidence
vote in parliament.  The premier said yesterday in an interview on Canale 5
television that he will reach out to some parliamentarians who
opposed him in the vote in a bid to broaden his majority. About
10 lawmakers from the UDC and Fini’s party may join the ruling
coalition, Corriere said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
