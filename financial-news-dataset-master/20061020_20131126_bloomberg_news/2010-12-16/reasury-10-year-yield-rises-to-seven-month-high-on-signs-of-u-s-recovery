Treasuries rose the most in a month
as benchmark 10-year note yields near seven-month highs
attracted buyers after Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis showed
signs of getting worse.  Yields  dropped as Moody’s Investors Service said it placed
Greece’s bond ratings on review for possible downgrade. Yields
earlier got a boost as Philadelphia-area manufacturing beat
forecasts, initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell and housing
starts increased. U.S. debt volatility was at the highest level
in more than a year.  “There are still worries coming out of Europe that are
lingering that are still supportive of the Treasury market,”
said  Jason Rogan , director of U.S. government trading in New
York at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a brokerage for institutional
investors. “ The market will trade volatile and illiquid into
the end of the year as people wind down their positions. The
action should be very choppy.”  The yield on the 10-year note slid 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 3.43 percent at 4:25 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 rose 26/32, or $8.13
per $1,000 face amount, to 93 1/4.  The 10-year note  yield  slid as much as 11 basis points in
the biggest intraday drop since Nov. 16. The yield earlier
touched 3.56 percent, the highest level since May 13. The two-
year note yield dropped three basis points to 0.65 percent after
reaching 0.69 percent, within a basis point of the highest level
since June 23.  Treasury Volatility  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE  index , which measures
volatility in Treasuries based on prices of over-the-counter
options maturing in 2 to 30 years, rose yesterday to 125.20, the
highest level since September 2009.  The seven-day  relative strength  index on the 10-year note
yield was above 70 for a third day today, according to Bloomberg
data. Readings at or above that level typically indicate yields
are poised to fall.  “The market is trying to find a comfort zone for where
rates should be,” said  Paul Horrmann , a broker in New York at
Tradition Asiel Securities Inc. “We are near levels that are
starting to seem attractive, but no one is dipping in too much
given the strength of the sell-off.”  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s  Dollar Index , used to track
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners, has gained 0.7 percent since Dec. 6 as the Treasury
10-year note yield increased almost 60 basis points.  U.S. debt erased losses as Moody’s said it placed Greece’s
Ba1 local and foreign currency government bond ratings on review
for possible downgrade.  Outlook for Greece  The review was prompted in part by concern about Greece’s
ability to cut debt to “sustainable levels” and a revenue
shortfall this year, Moody’s said. A downgrade of multiple
levels may be possible, Moody’s said.  Demand fell at Spain’s debt sale a day after Moody’s said
it may cut the nation’s credit rating. Spain’s 10-year
securities attracted bids equivalent to 1.67 times the amount on
offer, compared with 1.84 at the last auction Nov. 18. Moody’s
said yesterday it put Spain’s Aa1 debt rating on review for a
possible downgrade.  European Union leaders meet in Brussels today to discuss a
permanent crisis-fighting system. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  has ruled out an increase in the region’s emergency fund.  Jobless Claims  U.S. debt fell earlier as the Labor Department reported
that  first-time claims  for unemployment insurance fell to
420,000 during the week ended Dec. 11, from a revised 423,000 in
the prior period. The median forecast of 48 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an increase to 425,000 from a
previously reported 421,000.  Housing starts  advanced 3.9 percent to a 555,000 annual
rate in November after a drop of 11.1 percent in the prior month
and a decrease of 2.1 percent in September, the Commerce
Department reported.  The Philadelphia Fed reported its general economic  index , a
gauge of regional manufacturing, increased to 24.3 this month,
from 22.5 in November. The median forecast of 59 economists was
for a drop to 15. A reading greater than zero signals expansion.  The recovery “is continuing, though at a rate that has
been insufficient to bring down unemployment,” the Fed said
following its Dec. 14 meeting. Policy makers maintained a $600
billion program of debt purchases.  Primary dealers submitted today $22.084 billion of debt
maturing from June 2013 to November 2014 for possible purchase
by the central bank, compared with $13.114 billion in debt
maturing from December 2014 to May 2016 yesterday. The Fed
bought $6.780 billion of debt both today and yesterday, part of
$105 billion in purchases over the next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
