Korea Gas Corp., the world’s biggest
buyer of liquefied natural gas, agreed to acquire a 15 percent
stake in the  Santos Ltd. -led Gladstone LNG venture in Australia
to help meet domestic demand for the fuel.  The state-run utility will pay about $610 million for the
stake and will sign the deal with the Gladstone venture tomorrow,
Lee Jeong Ju, an assistant director of gas at South Korea’s
 energy ministry , said by telephone today. Jeremy Milne, a
spokesman for Santos in Adelaide, declined to comment.  The LNG venture is among A$200 billion ($197 billion) of
proposed developments in Australia targeting Asian demand for
cleaner-burning alternatives to coal. To help fund the project,
Santos agreed to sell a 15 percent stake in the venture to  Total
SA  for A$650 million, equivalent to $600 million on Sept. 9, the
day the transaction was announced.  “The Australian gas deal will help Korea Gas diversify its
import sources,” said  Jee Heon Seok , an analyst at NH
Investment & Securities Co. “The company has relied on the
Middle East and Southeast Asia.”  Under the Gladstone agreement, Korea Gas will get 3.5
million metric tons of LNG annually for 20 years starting 2015,
the South Korean energy ministry said in an e-mailed statement
today, without giving details on cost.  With Korea Gas’s stake acquisition, Santos will own 30
percent of the venture, while Malaysia’s  Petroliam Nasional Bhd. 
and Total will have 27.5 percent each, the energy ministry said.
Currently, Santos has a 37.5 percent share and Petronas 35
percent, while Total’s stake stands at 27.5 percent, it said.  Supplies From Gladstone  Korea Gas closed unchanged at 46,250 won in Seoul trading,
compared with the 0.4 percent decline in the benchmark Kospi
Index. Santos gained 2.9 percent to A$12.97 in Sydney, the most
in three months. The  S&P/ASX 200 Index  climbed 0.3 percent.  The Gladstone project will develop four coal-seam gas
fields in Queensland state. The development, including two units
to liquefy the gas for export, may cost A$16.4 billion,
according to Deutsche Bank.  The supplies from Gladstone will meet 11 percent of South
Korea’s consumption, according to the ministry. The country
currently imports 80 percent of the fuel from Qatar, Malaysia,
Oman and Indonesia.  Under the Gladstone deal, Korea Gas will also have the
right to re-export the gas, the energy ministry said.  The Gladstone venture and Korea Gas remain in “advanced
discussions but have not yet reached definitive agreement,”
Santos said in a regulatory filing today.  Overseas Expansion  Korea Gas plans to spend 17.8 trillion won ($15.4 billion)
by 2017 on overseas projects to bolster long-term LNG supplies,
Chief Executive Officer Choo Kang Soo said on May 7.  The South Korean company is aiming to increase gas
production from overseas fields in which it has stakes to 8.55
million tons a year by 2017 from 380,000 tons in 2009, Choo said.  Korea Gas is in talks to buy 9.8 percent of Indonesia’s
Senoro project run by  Mitsubishi Corp. , the utility said Oct. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
