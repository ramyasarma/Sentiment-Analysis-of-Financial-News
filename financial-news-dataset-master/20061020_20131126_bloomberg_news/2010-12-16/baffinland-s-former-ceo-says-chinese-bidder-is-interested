The former chief executive officer
of  Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. , the Canadian iron-ore miner that
agreed to be acquired by ArcelorMittal for C$433 million ($431
million), said a Chinese company is interested in making a
competing bid.  Gordon McCreary , speaking today in a telephone interview,
declined to identify the Chinese company.  McCreary  resigned  from Toronto-based Baffinland after the
board gave its  support  for Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal’s
C$1.10-a-share offer in November. Baffinland’s three iron-ore
deposits at its Mary River project would have a gross value of
about $140 billion at today’s prices, McCreary said.  “My message to people is do not tender to this woefully
inadequate C$1.10 offer,” McCreary said. “I’m doing everything
in my power to get a better bid on the table.”  Daniella Dimitrov, a director and vice chairman of
Baffinland, and Michael Zurowski, an executive vice president,
didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
