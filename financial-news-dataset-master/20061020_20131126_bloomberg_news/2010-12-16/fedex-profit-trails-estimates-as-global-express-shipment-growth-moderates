FedEx Corp.  raised its profit
forecast for fiscal 2011 after projecting the cost “headwinds”
that curbed second-quarter earnings will dissipate.  Adjusted profit may be $5 to $5.30 a share, up from a
September projection of $4.80 to $5.25, FedEx said today. The
second-largest U.S. package-shipping company posted earnings of
$1.16 a share in the three months through November, trailing the
$1.32  average estimate  of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Growth in international express shipments, FedEx’s most
profitable business, slowed with volumes rising 11 percent in
the quarter, down from gains of about 20 percent in each of the
previous two quarters. FedEx also faced higher fuel and
maintenance costs for its jet fleet, and increased compensation
expenses from restoring benefits trimmed during the recession.  “It’s easy to get accustomed to 20 percent growth and
think it’s going to go on forever, but 11 percent is still very
strong,”  Donald Broughton , an analyst at Avondale Partners LLC
in Nashville, Tennessee, said in a telephone interview. He has a
“market outperform”  rating  on the shares.  “When volume is growing at the rate it is, you have to
invest to bring in additional assets, bring planes back from the
desert, do more maintenance and labor,” he said. “That’s a
headwind now, but once it’s in production, they can harvest even
more volume and more yield.”  FedEx rose $1.83, or 2 percent, to $94.22 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The Memphis,
Tennessee-based company’s shares have gained 13 percent this
year.  Unit Combinations  Including one-time costs of 27 cents a share for combining
its freight unit with the division that handles shipments of
less than a truckload, FedEx said  net income  fell 18 percent to
$283 million, or 89 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter.
The year-ago profit was $345 million, or $1.10 a share.  Sales for the period rose 12 percent to $9.63 billion,
FedEx said. That trailed estimates of $9.77 billion.  “We expect margins to improve in the second half of fiscal
2011 and in fiscal 2012, as we continue to benefit from solid
global demand for our differentiated services and as certain
cost headwinds subside next fiscal year,” Chief Financial
Officer  Alan Graf  said in the statement.  FedEx and  United Parcel Service Inc.  deliver items ranging
from electronics and pharmaceuticals to financial documents and
clothing, making them economic bellwethers.  FedEx said separately that it agreed to buy MultiPack, a
Mexican express package-delivery company with 48 distribution
centers and more than 500 retail outlets in the country.  Founded in 1939, MultiPack provides pick-up and delivery
across all 31 Mexican states, FedEx said. Terms of the
acquisition weren’t disclosed.  FedEx’s financial adviser was JPMorgan Chase & Co., and
MultiPack’s was Credit Suisse Group AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
