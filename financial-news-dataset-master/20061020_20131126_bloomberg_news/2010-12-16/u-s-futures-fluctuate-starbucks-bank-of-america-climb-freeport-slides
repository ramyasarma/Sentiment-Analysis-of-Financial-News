U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index rising to its highest level since September
2008, after claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly fell and
housing starts increased last month.  Alcoa Inc. and steel producers rallied as materials stocks
recovered from earlier losses. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. climbed 4.1
percent after agreeing to repurchase shares from Borse Dubai
Ltd.  Visa Inc.  and MasterCard Inc. tumbled at least 10 percent
after the Federal Reserve released proposed new rules to curb
debit-card fees.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.6 percent to
1,242.87 as of 4 p.m. in New York, its highest level since the
aftermath of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average gained 41.78 points, or 0.4 percent, to
11,499.25, its highest point since Sept. 8, 2008.  “The news that’s out is supportive of an improving
economy,” said  Tom Wirth , senior investment officer for Chemung
Canal Trust Co., which manages $1.5 billion in Elmira, New York.
“It’s not an economy that’s taking off, but in a stable state
of growth. There’s bullish sentiment on the Street and managers
that need to get money to work.”  The S&P 500 slipped yesterday, dragging the index down from
a two-year high. The index has advanced seven of the past eight
days, and is trading at 15.5 times reported earnings, its most
expensive level since June. The gauge has risen 84 percent from
its low in March 2009 as corporate profits exceeded estimates,
economic indicators improved and the Federal Reserve purchased
assets to boost growth.  Jobless Claims  The number of U.S. workers filing first-time claims for
unemployment benefits unexpectedly declined last week, pointing
to a labor market that is on the mend. Applications for jobless
insurance payments decreased by 3,000 to 420,000, the lowest in
three weeks, Labor Department figures showed. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey projected a median rise in claims to 425,000.  Builders in the U.S.  began work on more homes  in November
for the first time in three months, showing the industry is
struggling to recover. Housing starts rose to a 555,000 annual
rate, up 3.9 percent from October’s 534,000 pace that was higher
than initially estimated, Commerce Department figures showed.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called for a
550,000 pace.  Robert Doll , vice chairman of BlackRock Inc. in New York,
forecast the S&P 500 will rally by almost 10 percent by the end
of next year to about 1,350 as the economy improves and
corporate earnings rise. He estimated per-share profit at
companies in the index will rise to between $93 and $95 in 2011.  ‘Big Valuation Gap’  Doll, whose firm manages about $3.4 trillion, doesn’t think
rising bond yields will hurt stocks. The yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond rose to 4.59 percent yesterday, its highest level
since April.  “Even with the rise in rates, there’s still a pretty big
valuation gap between stocks and bonds in favor of stocks,”
Doll said. “The risk is that we do get some multiple expansion,
and if we do, 1,350 is too low a target” for the S&P 500. Bond
yields are increasing because the economy is strengthening, he
added.  All 10 of the main S&P 500 industry groups advanced, led by
industrials. Materials shares rallied 1.1 percent after earlier
falling as much as 0.5 percent.  Alcoa  gained 3.6 percent to $14.46, the biggest jump in the
Dow. AK Steel Holding Corp. rose 6.6 percent to $15.36, the
biggest advance in the S&P 500, and Steel Dynamics Inc. jumped
3.4 percent to $17.63.  Nasdaq OMX Rises  Nasdaq OMX , owner of the second-largest U.S. equity
exchange, rose after agreeing to repurchase 22.8 million of its
shares from Borse Dubai Ltd. for about $497 million. The stock
climbed 4.1 percent to $23.46.  Shares of Visa, the world’s biggest payment network,
dropped after the Fed proposed new rules to curb debit-card
fees, offering alternative plans that are likely to aid
retailers and cut profit for U.S. lenders who reaped about $15
billion from such charges last year.  Terms outlined by the Fed in documents posted on its
website today include a plan with caps no higher than 12 cents
per transaction. The fees currently average about 1 percent.
Visa slumped 13 percent to $67.19, the largest decline since
October 2008.  MasterCard  declined 10 percent to $223.49, the
biggest drop since January 2009.  “Setting a cap ensures that no issuer is able to receive
an interchange fee at an unreasonably high level,” said  Janet Yellen , Fed vice chairman, in a memo outlining the proposals.  Transocean, BP  Transocean Ltd. fell as President  Barack Obama ’s
administration sued units of those companies, among others, over
allegations in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  BP Plc , among
others, were also sued. Transocean dropped 3.6 percent to $69.31
as the  owner of the rig  that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in
April was cut to “equalweight” from “overweight” at Morgan
Stanley.  Energizer Holdings Inc., the maker of Energizer and
Eveready batteries, rose 6.4 percent to $74.34, the most since
July. Analysts  Constance M. Maneaty  of BMO Capital Markets Corp.
and  Christopher Ferrara  of Bank of America Corp. said Procter &
Gamble Co.’s Duracell unit plans to match the first-quarter
price increases Energizer plans. Ferrara also raised his 2011
and 2012 earnings estimates for Energizer.  FedEx Corp. rose 2 percent to $94.22, erasing earlier
declines of as much as 1.2 percent. The second-largest U.S.
package-shipping company posted  quarterly profit  that trailed
analysts’ estimates and raised its full-year forecast, as cost
“headwinds” decline in the coming months.  Casino Companies  Las Vegas Sands Corp. rose 7.1 percent to $45.25. The U.S.
casino company expanding in Asia is a buying opportunity after a
decline, according to Morgan Stanley. The shares fell 18 percent
from Dec. 2 through yesterday.  Wynn Resorts Ltd. gained 4.8 percent to $105.59. The owner
of the Wynn and Encore casinos was raised to “overweight” from
“neutral” at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Three people who worked at technology firms including
chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. were arrested along with
an “expert networker” as federal prosecutors expanded a probe
of insider trading to companies. Today’s arrests were the latest
development in a nationwide investigation of illegal trading at
hedge funds by Manhattan U.S. Attorney  Preet Bharara , the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Manufacturing in the Philadelphia  region expanded more than
forecast in December to the highest since April 2005. The
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index
rose to 24.3 from 22.5 last month. Readings greater than zero
signal expansion in the area covering eastern Pennsylvania,
southern New Jersey and Delaware.  To contact the reporter on this story:
