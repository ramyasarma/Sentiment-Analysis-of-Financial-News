Flughafen Wien AG , the operator of
Vienna International Airport, said three top managers who
presided over delays and cost overruns in the construction of a
new terminal will leave the company.  Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Kaufmann  will resign as of
Dec. 31, almost four years before the end of his term, the
company said in a statement today. He’ll be temporarily replaced
by supervisory board chairman  Christoph Herbst , who’ll take the
post from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2011. The two other management
board members, Ernest Gabmann and Gerhard Schmid, will leave by
the end of next year, also earlier than planned.  Flughafen’s new Skylink terminal, which the company said in
2002 would cost 210 million euros ($278 million) to build and be
finished in 2006, is now slated to open in 2012 at a cost of at
least 830 million euros. Austria’s audit court has investigated
the delays and cost overruns, the company said.  “Members of the management board did not violate any
provisions of stock corporation law or criminal law,” Flughafen
said in the statement.  Flughafen’s main  shareholders  are the city of Vienna and
the Lower Austria province, which surrounds the capital. Each
owns 20 percent of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story: Boris Groendahl in Vienna
