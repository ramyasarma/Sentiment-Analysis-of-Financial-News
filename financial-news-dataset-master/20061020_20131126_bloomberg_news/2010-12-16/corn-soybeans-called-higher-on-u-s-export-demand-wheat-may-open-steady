What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after a government report
showed increased export demand for shrinking supplies of U.S.
grain, said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst for Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on speculation that adverse weather will reduce
production in South America, increasing demand for U.S.
supplies, Henderson said. Soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $2
higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open up
0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound.  -- Wheat futures may open little changed on the CBOT, the Kansas
City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange as lower
supplies of high-quality grain are countered by more production
next year, Henderson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
