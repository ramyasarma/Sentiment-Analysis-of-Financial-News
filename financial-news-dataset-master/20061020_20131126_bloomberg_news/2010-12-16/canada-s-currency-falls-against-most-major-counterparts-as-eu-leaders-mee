The Canadian dollar weakened against
most of its major peers as crude oil declined and European Union
leaders met to discuss a crisis-fighting system amid concern
their region’s sovereign-debt crisis will broaden.  Canada’s currency fell versus 15 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts, dropping the most against the Swedish krona. It
has traded between C$1.0287 and C$1.0001 versus the greenback
for a month. Foreigners purchased more Canadian securities than
they sold for a seventh month, Statistics Canada said.  “Canadian corporate accounts are buying U.S. dollars down
below, and there’s sovereign and external buying of Canadian
dollars for reserves and securities,”  John Curran , Toronto-
based senior vice president at CanadianForex Ltd., an online
foreign-exchange dealer, said by phone from Toronto. “We’re
locked in a range here until there’s a clear winner.”  Canada’s currency slipped 0.1 percent to C$1.0061 per U.S.
dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0050 yesterday, when it
touched C$1.0001, the strongest level since Nov. 11. It fell 0.7
percent against the krona to 6.7635. One Canadian dollar
purchases 99.39 U.S. cents.  Crude oil for January delivery fell as much as 1.1 percent
in New York to $87.63 a barrel. Canada derives about half its
exports from the sale of raw materials including crude.  EU leaders at a two-day summit in Brussels agreed to amend
the bloc’s treaties to create a permanent crisis-management
mechanism in 2013. Divisions flared over steps to prevent the
debt crisis from engulfing Portugal and Spain.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  earlier ruled out putting
more money on the table, retooling the support facility to
enable it to buy troubled governments’ bonds or further
entwining Europe’s economies through joint bond sales.  Weakened Versus Euro  The  Canadian dollar  weakened as much as 0.4 percent versus
the euro to C$1.3334. It closed at C$1.3326 today, compared with
C$1.3279 yesterday, when it jumped 1.4 percent versus the common
currency, the most in three weeks.  “The underlying trend here seems to be lower” for the
euro versus the Canadian dollar,  Shaun Osborne , chief currency
strategist in Toronto at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities
unit, said via e-mail. “C$1.3220 to C$1.3230 is, technically,
very important support, because it connects the July, September
and early December lows.” Support refers to the lower boundary
of a trading range, where buy orders may be clustered.  Foreigners bought a net C$9.51 billion ($9.46 billion) of
Canadian securities in October, more than half of which was
corporate bonds, approaching an annual record, Ottawa-based
Statistics Canada said today.  Bonds Rise  Canadian government bonds rose, pushing the 10-year note’s
 yield  down seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.26
percent. It increased to 3.372 percent two days ago, the highest
level since June 21. The price of the 3.5 percent security
maturing in June 2020 gained 54 cents to C$101.98.  The nation’s government securities are down 0.8 percent
this month, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  The greenback briefly reversed a slide against most major
peers today after data unexpectedly showed  manufacturing  in the
Philadelphia region expanded in December at the fastest pace
since April 2005. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
general economic index rose to 24.3 from 22.5 last month. It was
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey to decrease to 15.  Canada’s currency will trade on a one-for-one basis with
its U.S. counterpart by the end of March 2011, according to the
median forecast of 32 economists and analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Dean Popplewell , an analyst at Oanda Corp., said it will
reach parity sooner.  “Expect parity support to be breached ahead of the new
year, as corporates curb their dollar-buying interest on the
back of recent stellar U.S. data,” Popplewell, based in
Toronto, said via e-mail. “As the currency comes with none of
the U.S. baggage, there is good interest in the marketplace to
want to own the loonie in U.S. dollar rallies, and especially on
the crosses,” he said, referring to non-U.S. dollar trades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
