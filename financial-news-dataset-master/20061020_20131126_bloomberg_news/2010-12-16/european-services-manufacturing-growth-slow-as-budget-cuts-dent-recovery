     Dec. 16 Bloomberg) -- Europe’s services and manufacturing
industries slowed in December as governments’ spending cuts to
tame the sovereign debt crisis dented the recovery.  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both industries fell to 55 from 55.5 in November,
London-based Markit Economics said today. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has powered the euro
area’s expansion, led by export orders while countries on the
region’s periphery struggle to emerge from the recession. With
governments across the region stepping up austerity measures to
tackle deficits, the European Commission last month forecast
growth to weaken into 2011.  “It’s a mixed picture for the euro region, some economies
are really gathering pace and that’s related to China,” said
Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Group in Amsterdam. “The
overall story is there’s huge financial turmoil in the euro
region and that’s usually a bad sign for the economic outlook in
the euro region overall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
