Asian stocks fluctuated as
information-technology companies rose after an industry official
said prices of some memory chips may climb, while Mitsui & Co.
led commodity companies lower after metal prices dropped.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Inc., the world’s
largest maker of custom chips, increased 1.7 percent in Taipei,
and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. gained 1.4 percent in Seoul. Dena
Co., a maker of game software for handsets, jumped 8.6 percent
after winning business from Samsung Electronics Co. Mitsui &
Co., which counts commodities as its biggest source of profit,
fell 1.3 percent in Tokyo.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed at 133.94 as
of 11:21 a.m. in Tokyo, with about as many stocks advancing as
declining.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
