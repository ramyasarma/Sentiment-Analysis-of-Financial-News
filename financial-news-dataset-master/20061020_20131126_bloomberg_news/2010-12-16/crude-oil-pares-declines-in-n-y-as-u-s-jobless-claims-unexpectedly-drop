Crude oil dropped to the lowest
level in two weeks after U.S. claims for jobless benefits
unexpectedly fell and housing starts increased last month,
strengthening the dollar.  Oil tumbled 1 percent as the U.S. currency advanced from
the day’s low against the euro, curbing the appeal of
commodities as an alternative investment. The dollar has gained
3.2 percent in the past four weeks. Oil has traded in a range of
less than $3 a barrel this month.  “Better economic data is bearish for oil because it gives
strength to the U.S. dollar,” said  Phil Flynn , a Chicago-based
analyst and trader with investment adviser PFGBest. “Better
economic data means less stimulus is needed, which means a
stronger dollar.”  Crude for January delivery fell 92 cents to $87.70 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since
Dec. 1. Futures have dropped 3.4 percent from a two-year
intraday high of $90.76 reached on Dec. 7.  “You’re continuing to see the market try to consolidate
between $87 and $90,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Applications for  jobless insurance  payments fell by 3,000
to 420,000, the lowest level in three weeks, Labor Department
figures showed today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected an increase in claims to 425,000, according to the
median forecast.  Housing Starts  Housing starts rose to a 555,000 annual rate, up 3.9
percent from October’s 534,000 pace, Commerce Department figures
showed today in Washington. It was the first gain in three
months.  “There’s good economic news, but it’s not great, it’s just
slightly good,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic
Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts. “The
bull market is maybe getting a little tired. It’s priced in an
economic recovery in the U.S. and a tighter market.”  The dollar traded at $1.323 per euro, little changed from
yesterday’s $1.3214. Earlier, it rose as much as 0.3 percent to
$1.3181.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities
declined 0.5 percent to 317.34, the third daily decrease.
Fourteen of the commodities dropped.  Brent crude oil for January settlement declined 49 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $91.71 on the London-based ICE Futures
exchange. The January Brent contract expired at the close of
trading today. The more active February contract dropped 55
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $91.60 a barrel.  Brent Outlook  Barclays Plc increased its forecast for Brent oil in London
to $91 a barrel from $85 in a note today. The crude has averaged
$79.75 a barrel so far this year.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
increase crude loadings by the smallest amount since October as
demand for winter fuels passes its peak, according to Oil
Movements.  Shipments  will rise 0.3 percent to 23.46 million barrels a
day in the four weeks to Jan. 1 from 23.39 million in the period
ended Dec. 4, the Halifax, England-based tanker tracker said
today in a report. That’s the smallest gain since Oct. 2. The
data exclude Ecuador and Angola.  Oil climbed 0.4 percent yesterday after the U.S. Energy
Department said inventories tumbled 9.85 million barrels last
week to 346 million, almost quadruple the drop of 2.5 million
barrels forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gulf Coast Decline  The increase was tempered as the stockpile decline was
concentrated on the Gulf Coast, where oil companies have a tax
incentive to keep inventories low at the end of the year.
Imports decreased 15 percent to the lowest level since September
2008.  “Everyone viewed the big draw yesterday as pretty much
end-of-year tax stuff,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP
Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York. “The market’s still
kind of struggling a little bit until it can prove one way or
another which way it can go.”  Enbridge Inc.  said that its main pipeline system returned
to service after it was affected early today by a power outage
in Regina, Saskatchewan. The 2 million-barrel-a-day Canadian
mainline system carries oil from Edmonton, Alberta, to Gretna,
Manitoba. It connects to the 1,900-mile (3,057 kilometer) U.S.
Lakehead system, which brings oil to refiners in the Midwest.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 593,753
contracts as of 3:53 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 775,656
contracts yesterday, 13 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.39 million contracts, the
highest level in four weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
