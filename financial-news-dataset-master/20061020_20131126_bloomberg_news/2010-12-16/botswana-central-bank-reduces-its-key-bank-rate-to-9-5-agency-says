Botswana’s central bank reduced its
benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to 9.5
percent as it sought to spur demand in the face of weak growth
worldwide.  “With the fragile global economic recovery still dependent
on macroeconomic stimuli, the main focus is now on monetary
policy stimulus to raise private sector demand and investment,”
the Bank of Botswana, based in the capital, Gaborone, said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The inflation rate will drop into the 3 percent to 6
percent range from the second quarter of 2011, the bank said.
Inflation in Botswana, the world’s biggest producer of diamonds,
was unchanged at 7.2 percent in November, the statistics agency
reported yesterday.  Botswana’s economy contracted 6 percent in 2009 following a
collapse in diamond sales that forced mines to shut for four
months.  “It is anticipated that demand and its impact on economic
activity will be subdued, reflecting sluggish growth in personal
incomes and the increase in VAT, administered prices and other
government levies,” the bank said.  On Aug. 27, the International Monetary Fund said Botswana
should refrain from cutting borrowing costs because inflation
has not been reduced enough.  To contact the reporters on this story:
