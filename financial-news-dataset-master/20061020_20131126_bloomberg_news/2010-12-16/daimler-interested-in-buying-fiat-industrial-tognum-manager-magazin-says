Daimler AG remains interested in
acquiring part or all of Fiat SpA’s industrial unit as well as
repurchasing former unit Tognum AG, which is 28 percent-owned by
the automaker, Manager Magazin reported citing unidentified
company officials.  Daimler could buy into the Fiat unit that includes
truckmaker Iveco after a planned initial public offering, if a
deal isn’t reached earlier, the magazine said in an advance
release of story in tomorrow’s edition. Daimler had previously
offered Fiat about 10 billion euros for the unit that also makes
agriculture equipment, while Fiat was seeking between 12 billion
and 13 billion euros, Manager Magazin reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
