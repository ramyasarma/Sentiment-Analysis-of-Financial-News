Robinsons Land Corp.  fell the most
in six months in Manila stock trading after it was downgraded by
CitisecOnline.com Inc. on concern a lack of land to develop
projects will hurt earnings.  Shares of the second-largest Philippine shopping-mall
developer slumped 5.5 percent to 16.02 pesos as of 11:41 a.m.
local time, set for the steepest loss since June 7. The
benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index decreased 1.6 percent.  Robinsons Land was cut to “hold” from “buy” at
CitisecOnline, according to a Dec. 15 report by  Richard Laneda ,
an analyst at the Manila-based brokerage.  “Robinsons is the least favored play in the property
sector given its limited land bank, which is hampering its
ability to capitalize on the strength of the sector,” Laneda
wrote. “Although the company is taking steps to address this
problem, it will take time for earnings to materialize.”  A plan by  Robinsons Land  to sell shares in a rights
offering “will lead to significant dilution in the near term,”
Laneda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
