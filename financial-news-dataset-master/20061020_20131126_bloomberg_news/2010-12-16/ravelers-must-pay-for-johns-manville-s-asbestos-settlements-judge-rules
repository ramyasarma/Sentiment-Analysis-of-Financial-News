Travelers Cos.  must immediately pay
about $500 million to asbestos victims under a settlement made
six years ago in the bankruptcy of Johns Manville Corp., a judge
ruled.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Burton Lifland  in Manhattan said in
an order signed today that his ruling should resolve a dispute
over whether a U.S. Supreme Court ruling reversed an earlier
order over the settlements, among Travelers Indemnity Co. and
Travelers Casualty & Surety Co., for their work as insurers to
Johns Manville.  “The Court will resolve this narrow dispute that has gone
on for too long, especially for those asbestos victims who have
yet to be fully compensated,” Lifland said.  Johns Manville, once the nation’s largest maker
of asbestos, filed for bankruptcy in 1982. In June 2009, the
Supreme Court overturned a ruling that allowed suits against
units of Travelers by people harmed by exposure to asbestos.  “Just as the Supreme Court has barred parties from bringing
suit against Travelers based on the plain language of the 1986
orders, Travelers should likewise be bound by the plain language
of the settlements, and should be compelled to comply with its
payment obligations,” Lifland wrote.  The case is In re Johns Manville Corp., 82-11656, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
