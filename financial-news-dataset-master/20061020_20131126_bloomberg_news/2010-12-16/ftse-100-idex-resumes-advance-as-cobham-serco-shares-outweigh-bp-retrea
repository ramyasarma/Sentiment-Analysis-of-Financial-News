The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index  was little
changed as rises in companies from GKN Plc to Serco Group Plc
offset a retreat in BP Plc and metal producers.  GKN, which makes aircraft components for Airbus SAS, Serco,
which provides outsourcing services to the U.K. government, and
Pearson Plc, owner of the Financial Times newspaper, all rallied
more than 1.5 percent. BP limited gains after the company and
its drilling partners were sued by the U.S. government. BHP
Billiton Ltd. and Kazakhmys Plc also fell.  The  FTSE 100  was little changed at 5,881.12 at the 4:30
p.m. close in London after falling 0.2 percent yesterday. The
gauge had previously climbed for four days as China refrained
from raising interest rates and U.S. data bolstered confidence
in the world’s largest economy. The  FTSE All-Share Index  was
also little changed today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  added 0.3
percent.  GKN rallied 3 percent to 213.8 pence, the second-best
performer on the FTSE 100. Serco, which today said it remains
“on track” to deliver its financial guidance for 2010, climbed
4.1 percent to 597 pence and Pearson, which was yesterday
upgraded to “buy” at Deutsche Bank AG, climbed 1.9 percent to
1,024 pence.  BP limited gains on the benchmark index, falling 1.4
percent to 470 pence after the Obama administration filed a suit
saying the company and four others violated environmental laws
in the largest U.S. oil spill.  The company has set aside $40 billion to pay for cleanup
and litigation from the spill and is paying into a $20 billion
escrow account, demanded by Obama, to pay claims from
individuals affected by the accident.  Manic Miners  BHP, the world’s largest mining company, also retreated as
copper fell for a second day in New York, dropping 0.8 percent
to 2,505 pence. Antofagasta Plc slipped 2.1 percent to 1,528
pence.  Misys Plc rose 0.5 percent to 313.5 pence on the broader
FTSE 250 Index after the U.K. software provider announced the
result of its tender offer and plans to complete the return of a
total 670 million pounds to shareholders.  Stagecoach Group Plc rose 0.5 percent to 208.7 pence after
the operator of the U.K.’s busiest commuter-rail service was
upgraded to “hold” from “sell” at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc.  Travis Perkins Plc , owner of the Wickes home improvement-
products chain, gained 1.4 percent to 1,010 pence as Deutsche
Bank initiated coverage of the shares with a “buy”
recommendation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
