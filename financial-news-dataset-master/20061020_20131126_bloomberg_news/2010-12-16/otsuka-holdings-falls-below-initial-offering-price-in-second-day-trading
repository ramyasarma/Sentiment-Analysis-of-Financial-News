Otsuka Holdings Co. shares fell in
their second day of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
dropping below the price set by the Japanese drugmaker in the
world’s largest health-stock initial offering since at least
2006.   The shares slipped to 2,080 yen in the afternoon session.
The company last week sold them for 2,100 yen each in a 198
billion yen ($2.4 billion) offering.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
