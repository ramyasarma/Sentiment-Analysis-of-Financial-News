Spanish 10-year bonds declined,
pushing yields close to their highest in two weeks, after
Spain’s borrowing costs rose at its last debt sale for this year
amid mounting concern over the country’s credit quality.  German bonds declined with their U.S. counterparts as
reports added to evidence the world’s largest economy is
recovering. That pushed 10-year yields to the highest since May
even after data showed the euro region’s manufacturing and
services  industries  slowed more than economists forecast in
December. Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday it may
downgrade Spain’s credit rating, citing the cost of rescuing its
banks. European Union leaders begin a two-day meeting in
Brussels today to discuss solutions to the debt crisis.  “The cost of funding for Spain rose significantly at this
auction,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist
at UniCredit SpA in Milan. “That reflected perceived
deterioration of credit quality of Spain and that’s not going to
bode well for their bonds.”  Spanish 10-year yields rose two basis points to 5.54
percent at 4 p.m. in London. The 4.85 percent security due
October 2020 fell 0.14, or 1.4 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,323)
face amount, to 94.86. German 10-year yields increased four
basis points to 3.07 percent.  Irish 10-year yields rose five basis points to 8.42 percent
and Italian bond yields rose five basis points to 4.62 percent.  PMI Outlook  Spain sold 2.4 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of 10-year and
15-year bonds at an auction today, below a maximum target of 3
billion euros. It sold bonds due in 2020 at an average yield of
5.446 percent, compared with 4.615 percent last time when the
bond was sold on Nov. 18. The 15-year bonds were sold at an
average yield of 5.953 percent, compared with 4.541 percent at
the October auction.  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in manufacturing and service industries fell to 55 from
55.5 in November, the lowest in two months, London-based Markit
Economics said today. A figure above 50 indicates expansion and
economists had expected a reading of 55.3, according to the
median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The measure
of German manufacturing surged to 60.9, the highest since July.  The euro-region  inflation  rate stayed at 1.9 percent in
November, according to a final reading from the European Union
statistics office in Luxembourg. That matched an initial
estimate published on Nov. 30 and is the fastest pace since
November 2008. In the U.S., bonds dropped for a third day as
Philadelphia area manufacturing beat forecasts, initial jobless
claims unexpectedly fell and housing starts increased for the
first time in three months.  Debt Summit  Portuguese bonds were little changed, with the 10-year
yield at 6.58 percent, as European Union leaders prepared to
meet in Brussels today to discuss a permanent crisis-fighting
system, with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  ruling out an
increase in the region’s emergency fund.  Strife among Merkel, the European Central Bank, Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , and the German domestic
opposition intensified on the eve of the Brussels summit,
marring confidence in Europe’s handling of the fiscal woes that
forced Greece and Ireland to fall back on financial handouts.  “There is a situation of European gridlock again with
Germany blocking actions to make progress,” said  Nick Kounis ,
chief euro-region economist at ABN Amro NV in Amsterdam and a
former U.K. Treasury official. “There is a high risk of the
crisis re-escalating, and maybe now it’s the quiet before the
storm in markets.”  Germany plans to sell 302 billion euros in debt next year
compared with a provisional total of 312 billion euros of this
year, the Frankfurt-based Federal Finance Agency said today. It
will sell 185 billion euros in bonds and 117 billion euros in
bills in 2011, the agency said in an e-mailed statement.  German bonds returned 5.5 percent this year, compared with
4.8 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 5.2 percent for U.K. gilts,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Spanish bonds lost 5 percent, while Irish debt handed
investors a loss of 11 percent and Portuguese bonds dropped 7.4
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
