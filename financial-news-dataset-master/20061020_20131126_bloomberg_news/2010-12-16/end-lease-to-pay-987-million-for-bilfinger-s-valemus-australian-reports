Lend Lease Group will buy Bilfinger
Berger’s Australian unit Valemus for A$1 billion, the Australian
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.
The purchase, which will make Lend Lease Australia’s second-
largest contractor, may be announced as early as today, the
newspaper said. Valemus was valued at between A$1.22 billion and
A1.39 billion ahead of an initial share sale that it cancelled
due to unfavorable market conditions, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
