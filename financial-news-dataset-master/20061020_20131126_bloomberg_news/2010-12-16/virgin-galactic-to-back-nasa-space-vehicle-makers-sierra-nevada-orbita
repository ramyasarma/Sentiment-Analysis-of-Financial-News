Virgin Galactic will be supporting
the work of Sierra Nevada Space Systems and Orbital Sciences
Corporation, which are both pursuing commercial space vehicle
designs under NASA’s Commercial Crew Development Program.  The program presents an opportunity for Virgin Galactic
“to start to map a path towards a commercial orbital service
for fare-paying passengers by encouraging reusable technologies
and designs which can offer important advantages to safety, cost
and passenger experience,” the company said today in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
