Strobe lights, dry ice and an erotic
video show take center stage as Lady Gaga returns to  London .  Gaga -- who in recent extravaganzas modeled a meat dress, a
flame-throwing bra and a Santa skirt -- will tear through hits
from “Poker Face” to “Just Dance,” and sample new tunes
planned for “Born This Way,” her second album due next year.  Lady Gaga is at the  O2 , SE10 0DX. Information: +44-20-8463-
2000,  http://www.theo2.co.uk  and  http://www.ladygaga.com .  Saturday  As the temperature drops, ice skating takes over at some of
London’s heritage sites.  The 18th-century riverfront  Somerset House  has iced over
its courtyard. You can skate there all day and swerve at night
to DJ beats. For a starker setting, head for the rink at the
 Tower of London  -- where Henry VIII beheaded two of his wives.  Information:  http://www.toweroflondonicerink.com  or
+44-844-871-8814 for the Tower of London ice rink. For  Somerset
House ,  http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/  or +44-20-7845-4600.  Tom’s Terrace at Somerset House is an informal restaurant
known for its British fare -- shepherd’s pie, venison casserole.
There are also burgers and pasta dishes:  http://bit.ly/cDAEsL ,

dining’s best-kept secrets: Rosemary Lane, a small restaurant in
a former pub. There are special festive menus with dishes such
as organic slow-roast English goose breast:  http://bit.ly/fHQEhw   Saturday Night  A man in drag is packing crowds of all ages into the
Hackney Empire.  Actor Clive Rowe -- fake bosom bulging from a slew of
outrageous dresses -- stars as Dame Daisy in “ Jack and the
Beanstalk ” for the theater’s traditional Christmas pantomime.  Set in Hackneydale, a winter wonderland struggling to make
ends meet, the show features a dancing cow and a singing harp.
This being panto, there’s plenty of chance to boo and hiss as
the bad guys break wind, and crudely poke their noses.  The show ends Jan. 9, 2011, at the Hackney Empire, 291 Mare
Street, E8 1EJ. Information:  http://www.hackneyempire.co.uk  or
+44-20-8985-2424.  For less raucous thrills, try “The Nutcracker.”  There’s skating, sleighing and even a hot-air balloon in
this story of a girl who dreams her toy nutcracker is a dancing
prince. A swarm of big-eared, long-tailed mice add spooks, and
gifted soloists lift the game, with Vadim Muntagirov drawing
(exaggerated) comparisons with the late Rudolf Nureyev.  “The Nutcracker,” by the English National Ballet, ends
Dec. 30 at the Coliseum, St. Martin’s Lane, London WC2N 4ES.
Information:  http://www.ballet.org.uk  or +44-871-911-0200.  A short walk from the Coliseum, Rules -- London’s oldest
restaurant -- is a great spot for a seasonal celebration. Be
forewarned: There’s no turkey on the menu. It’s much too modern
for Rules. Information:  http://www.rules.co.uk/restaurant/   Sunday  Every day except Monday, a painter can be watched inside
the  National Gallery  putting the finishing touches to his work.  Armed with a spray gun, an old hair dryer, and stencils
prepared by a cutter, Ben Johnson is completing a meticulous
view of Trafalgar Square during his six-week residency at the
museum. He is aided by his assistant and wife Sheila Johnson.  Johnson is at the National Gallery through Jan. 23, 2011.
