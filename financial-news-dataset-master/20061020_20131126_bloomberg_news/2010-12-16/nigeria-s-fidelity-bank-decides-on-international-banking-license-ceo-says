Nigeria’s  Fidelity Bank Plc  will
apply for an international license and plans to sell its non-
banking units to meet new regulations, said  Reginald Ihejiahi ,
its chief executive officer.  “We opted to divest completely from the non-banking units
rather than having a holding company to manage them because they
are insignificant in terms of the business that we conduct for
our customers,” he said in an interview in Lagos, the
commercial capital, today.  The central bank in March asked lenders to separate their
banking and non-banking businesses to allow for better
supervision. Banks also needed to choose whether to operate as
regional, national or international lenders with minimum capital
requirements ranging from 15 billion naira ($100 million) for
regional banks to 100 billion naira for international lenders.  The rules form part of changes to the banking industry that
has amassed bad debts of more than $10 billion. The central bank
fired the chief executive officers of eight of the banks for
their handling of the crisis last year. Fidelity wasn’t one of
those affected.  The bank will sell the units “by whichever way the
independent consultants advise us to go,”  Christopher Ezeh , its
chairman, said in an interview today.  Ihejiahi said on Nov. 3 that the bank plans to open
branches in other African countries next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
