Uganda’s state pension fund bought
the total 40 billion-shilling bond issued by the local unit of
Standard Chartered Plc, the bank said today.  The National Social Security Fund bought the 10-year bond
with a 13 percent coupon, which will be listed on the Uganda
Securities Exchange, Lamin Kemba Manjang, the managing director
of Standard Chartered Bank Uganda, said by phone today from the
capital, Kampala.  The bond was issued to replace a 10-year, 6.45 billion note
issued five years ago, which will be fully redeemed this month,
he said on Nov. 26.  The exchange is waiting for the listing date said Kenneth
Ssenyondwa a spokesman at the bourse said by phone today. The
listing date was initially set for Dec. 2, he said.   The new bond will enable the bank to “finance
big projects because of a bigger capital base,” Manjang said,
without giving further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
