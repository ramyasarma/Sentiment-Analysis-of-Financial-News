Tullow Oil Plc expects to seal an
unspecified deal with the Ugandan government this week after
putting the necessary requirements in place, the Daily Monitor
newspaper reported today citing Elly Karuhanga, the chairman of
Tullow’s Ugandan unit.   The company, whose exploration license over Block 3A was
revoked in September, has been conducting ‘behind the scenes’
talks with government which will result in the expected deal,
the Kampala-based newspaper reported citing Karuhanga.  Tullow also plans to float shares on the Ugandan Security
Exchange when the government renews an exploration license over
Block 3A, the Daily Monitor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
