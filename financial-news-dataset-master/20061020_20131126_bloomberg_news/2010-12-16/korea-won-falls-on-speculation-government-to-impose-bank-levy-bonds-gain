South Korea’s won gained, reversing
earlier losses, on speculation exporters took advantage of the
currency’s drop to a two-week low to convert income before the
end of the year.  The won earlier weakened as much as 0.7 percent as Deputy
Finance Minister Shin Je Yoon said the government may unveil on
Dec. 19 details of a bank-levy plan on overseas borrowings.
Bonds snapped a three-day slide as the Ministry of Knowledge
Economy said that sales at major department stores grew at a
slower pace last month from October.  “There is some dollar selling among Korean companies,”
said Kim Si Jun, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co. in Seoul.  The won strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,152.85 per dollar as
of the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,162.40, its weakest level
since Nov. 30.  Department-store sales rose 10.1 percent in November from a
year earlier after having gained 13.3 percent the previous
month.  The yield on the 4 percent bond maturing in September 2015
dropped eight basis points to 4.11 percent, according to the
Korea Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
