New York Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo withdrew his appeal of a judge’s decision to throw out the
convictions of two former Marsh & McLennan Cos. executives he
found guilty of restraint of trade in 2008.  State Supreme Court Justice James Yates in Manhattan threw
out the convictions of William Gilman and Edward McNenney,
former managing directors at Marsh, in a July 2 decision. The
pair was accused of fixing prices to steer business to insurers
that paid Marsh hidden fees from November 1998 to September
2004.  Richard Bamberger, a spokesman for Cuomo, did not
immediately reply to a call and e-mail seeking comment.       To contact the reporter on this story:
