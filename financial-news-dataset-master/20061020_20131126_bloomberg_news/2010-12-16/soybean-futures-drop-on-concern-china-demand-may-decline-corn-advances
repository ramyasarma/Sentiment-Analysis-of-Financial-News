Soybeans fell from a one-month high
on speculation that demand may ease for animal feed and cooking
oil made from the oilseed in China, the world’s biggest producer
of hogs and consumer of vegetable oil. Corn rose.  U.S. exporters sold 84,648 metric tons of soybeans in the
week ended Dec. 9, down 87 percent from a week earlier,
Department of Agriculture  data  showed today. Chinese processors
bought a net 126,500 tons after canceling  orders  for 191,400
tons. Some of China’s consumers were seeking to delay U.S.
shipments, the National Grain & Oils Information Center said
this week.  “Soybean-export sales were very disappointing,” said
 Brian Grete , the senior marketing analyst at the Professional
Farmers of America newsletter in Cedar Falls, Iowa. “The
Chinese cancellations confirm market talk in the past week that
declining profit margins would lead to a slowdown in demand.”  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $13.0575 a bushel at 10:57 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Yesterday, the price reached $13.2475, the highest for
a most-active contract since Nov. 12. Before today, the
commodity climbed 45 percent since the end of June on record
Chinese demand for U.S. exports.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $5.8625 a bushel. Yesterday, the price reached
$5.945, the highest since Nov. 9, on demand to make grain-based
ethanol.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
