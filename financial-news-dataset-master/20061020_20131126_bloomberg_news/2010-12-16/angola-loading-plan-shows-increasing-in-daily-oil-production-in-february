Angola , Africa’s second-largest oil
producer, will ship at least 48 crude cargoes in February,
according to the preliminary loading plan.  A total of 45.6 million barrels, or 1.63 million a day,
will load in February, according to the program. January’s
schedule, which excluded two so-called pooled shipments,
comprised 51 shipments totaling 48.9 million barrels, or 1.58
million a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
