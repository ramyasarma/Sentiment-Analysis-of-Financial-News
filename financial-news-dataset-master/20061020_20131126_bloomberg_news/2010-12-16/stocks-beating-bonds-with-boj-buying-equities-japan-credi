Japanese stocks are the cheapest
relative to government bonds since the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., erasing this year’s loss as the central
bank starts 5 trillion yen ($59.6 billion) in asset purchases.  The Topix index’s earnings yield, or estimated earnings per
share divided by the stock price, is 5.2 percentage points more
than the 10-year government bond yield. That exceeds the five-
year average of 3.2 percent and is near the highest since
October 2008 when Lehman collapsed, freezing credit markets.  While  Bank of Japan  Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  faces
criticism he’s doing too little to spur growth, the Topix’s 8.8
percent gain since Sept. 30 shows improving investor confidence.
The BOJ said this week it bought 14.2 billion yen in exchange-
traded funds, the first in a plan announced on Oct. 5 to boost
prices of stocks and real-estate investment trusts.  “The asset-purchase program shows the BOJ isn’t a referee
but is actively backing the side of risk takers,” said  Ryoji Musha , president of Musha Research Co. and an adviser to
Deutsche Bank AG in Tokyo. “A shift from bonds to stocks will
take place at an unprecedented scale, boosting bond yields.”  The earnings yield for the Topix has swelled as estimated
 net income per share  at its 1,664 companies rose almost 40-fold
since March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Topix briefly erased its 2010 loss yesterday and traded at
902.87 as of 1:34 p.m. in Tokyo today, down 0.5 percent on the
year.  Household Assets  Japan’s stock benchmark has lost 69 percent from its peak
of 2,884.80 on Dec. 18, 1989, as deflation hindered growth and
discouraged investment in riskier assets.  Bank of Japan data 
show stocks make up 6.6 percent of the household assets,
compared with 30.6 percent in the U.S.  Since reaching a 19-month low on Nov. 2, the Topix has
surged 12 percent. The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond
reached 1.295 percent yesterday, matching the most since May 18
and up more than 40 basis points from Oct. 6 when it touched a
seven-year low. The yield may reach 2 percent next year, Musha
said, higher than the 1.250 percent prediction for the fourth
quarter of 2011 in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . forecasts the Topix will rise 11
percent to 1,000 at the end of 2011, strategists led by  Kathy Matsui  wrote in a Dec. 2 report, citing “supportive”
valuations. Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s biggest broker, said
in a Dec. 13 report the gauge will climb 22 percent to 1,100
next year and Japanese stocks will outperform global peers.  Erasing Losses  Since the BOJ announced its asset purchases, the Topix has
advanced 8.4 percent while government debt has lost 2.1 percent,
according to an index compiled by Bank of America Corp.’s
Merrill Lynch unit.  Five-year credit-default swaps on Japanese government bonds
were at 68.91 yesterday, CMA prices in New York show. That
compares with 69.85 for China. The contracts pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent if a government or company fails to adhere to debt
agreements.  Benchmark three-month commercial paper rates for businesses
with the lowest a2 debt ranking were at 0.33 percent from 0.40
percent on Oct. 4, according to data from Tokyo Tanshi Co.  Shirakawa has said increasing the asset-purchase fund is a
“probable option” should the economic outlook worsen. At its
October meeting, the central bank also cut its key overnight
lending rate to “virtually” zero, and pledged to keep it there
until it can forecast stable prices.  ‘Rather Cosmetic’  Koichi Hamada , who teaches economics at Yale University and
was Shirakawa’s professor at Tokyo University in the early
1970s, said the asset-purchase fund may be “too little and too
late” and “far insufficient.” The BOJ ought to expand asset
purchases to at least 20 trillion yen to boost the economy,
Hamada said in an interview in November.  Tomoya Masanao , who
oversees funds in Japan for Pacific Investment Management Co.,
which controls the world’s biggest bond fund, said last week the
BOJ plan was “rather cosmetic.”  Japan’s economy has grown for four-straight quarters. It
expanded 1.1 percent in the third quarter from the previous
period, faster than the 0.9 percent rise initially reported last
month, the government said on Dec. 9. That compares with a 0.6
percent expansion in the U.S. and a 0.4 percent gain in Europe.  For the five years through March 2006, the Bank of Japan
used so-called  quantitative easing  to combat deflation, which
included increased purchases of government debt. The Topix
gained 37 percent during the period compared with a 23 percent
increase for the MSCI World Index.  ‘Final Trigger’  The yen has weakened as the extra yield offered by U.S. and
Japanese 10-year government debt widened to 227 basis points, or
2.27 percentage points, on Dec. 15, the most since May. The
spread was at 215 basis points today. A weaker domestic currency
boosts the value of overseas income at companies when converted
into yen.  Japan’s currency has depreciated about 4.6 percent since it
touched 80.22 to the dollar on Nov. 1, the highest since April
1995 when it reached a postwar record of 79.75. The yen may
weaken to 90 by the end of 2011, according to the median
estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The BOJ’s announcement on Oct. 5 was the final trigger
for me to be bullish on Japanese stocks,” said  Masafumi Oshiden , investment manager of ING Mutual Funds Management Co.
(Japan) Ltd., which manages the equivalent of $15.4 billion.
“The yen’s appreciation is correcting with the widening yield
spread between U.S. and Japanese bonds. Japanese stocks are more
likely to go up once they are freed from currency concerns.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
