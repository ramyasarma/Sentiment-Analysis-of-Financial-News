Positive expectations for Brazilian
President-elect  Dilma Rousseff ’s government is 62 percent,
according to an Ibope poll commissioned by the National
Industrial Confederation.  Support for outgoing president  Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva
rose to 87 percent from 85 percent in September, the poll
showed. Of those surveyed 18 percent think Rousseff’s government
will be better than Lula’s and 58 percent said it would be as
good.  The nationwide poll of 2,002 people was taken Dec. 4-9 and
has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.  Rousseff, Lula’s former cabinet chief, won 56 percent of
the votes in an Oct. 31 runoff against  Jose Serra , the former
governor of Sao Paulo state. She takes office Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
