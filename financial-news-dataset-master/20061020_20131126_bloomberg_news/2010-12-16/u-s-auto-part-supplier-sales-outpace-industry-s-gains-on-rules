U.S. auto-part suppliers  BorgWarner
Inc. ,  Gentex Corp.  and Tenneco Inc. are boosting revenue faster
than vehicle sales are growing as safety and fuel-efficiency
rules force automakers to adopt new technologies.  BorgWarner, which makes turbochargers that enhance small
engines, said sales this year will top its total from 2007,
before the financial crisis caused a collapse in auto sales.
 Revenue  at Gentex, which makes vehicle mirrors, may top its
level before the crash this year, and Tenneco, which makes
filters for diesel exhaust, may do the same next year.  The suppliers are selling new equipment to help automakers
meet a U.S. requirement to increase the fuel efficiency of cars
and light trucks 30 percent by 2016. Interest in new safety
features, including rearview cameras, is boosting demand at the
same time as auto sales and production are rebounding.  “With the recovery and the adoption curve it’s a double-
kick some of these companies are getting,”  Brian Johnson , an
analyst with Barclays Capital in Chicago, said in an interview.  U.S. light-vehicle sales may rise 11 percent to 11.5 million
this year, according to IHS Automotive in Northville, Michigan.
 Annual sales  plunged to 10.4 million last year, the worst since
1982, after averaging 16.8 million from 2000 to 2007.  U.S. vehicle production will increase 38 percent to 11.9
million this year from 8.6 million in 2009, and will reach 12.9
million next year, IHS said. The group forecasts output will
regain the 2007 level of 15.1 million by 2014. Global production
will increase to 75.5 million next year from 66 million in 2008,
according to IHS.  Sales Rebound  Gentex, based in Zeeland, Michigan, is expected to boost
revenue 48 percent to $807.6 million this year, the average of
10 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in 2007 were
$653.9 million.  The company may expand revenue as much as 20 percent a year
as products such as its mirrors that display images from a rear-
mounted camera are increasingly adopted by  Ford Motor Co. ,
 Volkswagen AG  and  Honda Motor Co. ,  David Leiker , an analyst with
Robert W. Baird & Co., wrote in a research note Dec. 6.  A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plan to
require rearview cameras in all new cars by 2014 would expand
Gentex’s potential market to half of all light vehicles from
one-third if it becomes law, Leiker wrote. The company’s  shares 
surged 18 percent on Dec. 3, the day the proposal was made
public. The shares fell 13 cents to $29.04 yesterday and have
climbed 63 percent this year.  End-Market Demand  “We’re going from the bottom of the cycle to the top and
the end-market demand is growing,” Leiker said in an interview.  Leiker, who is based in Milwaukee, has an “outperform”
rating on Gentex,  Autoliv Inc.  and  Johnson Controls Inc. , the
largest U.S. auto-part supplier.  The stricter proposed fuel-economy and safety standards
would depress auto sales and increase the cost of vehicles to
consumers, the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive
Research said in a study yesterday.  The average vehicle cost would rise by more than 22 percent
if the U.S. requires automakers to double fuel economy to more
than 60 mpg by 2025, the group said. Consumers replacing older
vehicles with new ones at a slower rate would benefit
aftermarket parts-makers and auto-repair companies, said  Sean McAlinden , the group’s chief economist.  BorgWarner has  forecast  2010 sales will gain 40 percent
from last year and said in November that its backlog of new
powertrain business for 2011 through 2013 had increased 28
percent from the prior three-year period.  Turbochargers, Emissions  About 77 percent of the expected $2.3 billion in new
business from 2011 through 2013 will be from engine-related
products such as turbochargers and emissions controls, the
Auburn Hills, Michigan-based company said in a statement Nov. 9.  “We’re being awarded a lot of business right now, and it
will show up in the next two to five years,” BorgWarner Chief
Executive Officer Tim Manganello  said on a conference call with
analysts and investors.  BorgWarner  shares  rose 71 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $68.16
yesterday and have more than doubled this year.  Tenneco, which makes mufflers and diesel exhaust filters
used by  General Motors Co. ,  Daimler AG  and  Caterpillar Inc. , is
expected to post revenue of $5.83 billion this year, the average
 estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be
a 25 percent gain from last year. Revenue next year is expected
to rise to $6.86 billion, the average estimate of eight
analysts, topping its $6.18 billion in 2007 sales.  Emissions Standards  The company is benefiting as makers of autos and heavy
equipment work to meet stricter emission standards across the
world’s largest markets such as the U.S., Europe, China, Japan,
Brazil, Russia and India.  Tenneco fell 68 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $40.54 yesterday
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The Lake Forest,
Illinois-based company has more than doubled this year.  The  Bloomberg Americas Auto Part/Equipment Index , a 22-
company group of suppliers, has gained 57 percent this year and
reached a 52-week intraday high Dec. 7.  “It’s both pleasing and a bit surprising that we’ve seen
these companies come back as soon as they have,” said  Jim Gillette , an analyst at IHS. “A year and half ago, we thought
the end of the world was right around the corner.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
