Spain’s Treasury sold 2.4 billion
euros ($3.2 billion) of bonds, less than its maximum target, as
borrowing costs surged after Moody’s Investors Service said it
may downgrade the country’s credit rating.  The nation sold 1.78 billion euros of 10-year bonds at an
average yield of 5.446 percent, compared with 4.615 percent last
time the securities were issued on Nov. 18, the Bank of Spain
said today in Madrid. It also sold 618.7 million euros of 15-
year debt at 5.953 percent, compared with 4.541 percent when the
paper was last sold on Oct. 21.  The Treasury aimed to raise as much as 3 billion euros in
the last sale of the year, less than the habitual target, after
Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said the nation would reduce
issuance amid an increase in borrowing costs. The government is
pre-funding for 2011 as this year’s needs have already been
covered, Salgado said.  Demand for Spanish 10-year bonds was 1.67 times the amount
sold, compared with 1.84 at the last auction on Nov. 18, the
Bank of Spain said. The bid-to-cover ratio for the 15-year bonds
was 2.52 times, compared with 1.44 times at the October auction.  Spain is trying to convince investors that the nation and
its lenders will be able to meet their refinancing needs next
year without having to follow Ireland into seeking a European
bailout. After an increase in Spain’s extra borrowing costs to a
euro-era high, Moody’s said yesterday it may cut the country’s
Aa1 rating as public and private refinancing needs next year
make it “susceptible to further episodes of funding stress.”  Yield Spread  The  gap  between Spanish and German 10-year bond yields was
steady after the sale at 247 basis points. That compares with a
euro-era intraday peak of 298 basis points on Nov. 30, and an
average of 15 basis points in the first decade of monetary
union.  Spain, reeling from the collapse of a debt-fueled housing
boom, has the highest unemployment rate in the euro region at
more than 20 percent and the third-largest budget deficit, at 11
percent of gross domestic product last year. Socialist Prime
Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  is trying to restore
investor confidence with measures that have eroded his support
among voters to record lows. The ruling Socialists would win
24.3 percent of the vote if elections were held now compared
with 43.1 percent for the People’s Party, according to a poll
published on Dec. 5 by newspaper  El Pais .  Zapatero meets European counterparts today in Brussels,
where they will discuss the creation of a permanent mechanism to
support countries with financing difficulties from 2013. The
temporary facility set up in May expires that year.  Germany is hardening its opposition to expanding the
facility, increasing discord between Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
and ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  ahead of the summit amid
concerns that the existing 750 billion-euro fund may not be big
enough if more countries seek help.  To contact the reporters on this story:
