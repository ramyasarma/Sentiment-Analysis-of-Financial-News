Gold fell to a two-week low on
investor sales after the metal’s rally to a record this year.
Silver, palladium and platinum also dropped.  In 2010, gold has gained 25 percent, heading for the 10th
straight annual gain, amid record investment in exchange-traded
funds backed by physical metal. The price reached an all-time
high of $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7, partly on demand for a
store of value amid escalating debt in the U.S. and Europe.  “Gold is on the defensive,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “A lot
of people have caught a huge move up this year, and they’re
going to look to bank profit.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell $15.20, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $1,371 at 1:54 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price touched $1,361.60, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Nov. 29.  The metal may tumble to as low as $1,180 next year as
“jittery longs” trigger a “big flushout,” Klopfenstein said.
He also predicted gold will rise to $1,550 in 2011.  Gold assets in exchange-traded products rose 8.14 metric
tons to 2,099.7 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14.  “We don’t feel confident enough to guess at when the
selloff will stop,”  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global
Holdings Ltd. in Chicago, said in a report. “The decline could
be caused by year-end posturing, or even movements of large
funds out of the market.”  Silver futures for March delivery fell 47.1 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $28.782 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has gained
71 percent this year.  Palladium futures for March delivery dropped $10.10, or 1.3
percent, to $742.55 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Platinum futures for January delivery declined $5.80, or
0.3 percent, to $1,698.60 an ounce.  Palladium has surged 82 percent this year, and platinum is
up 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
