Constantino de Oliveira , founder of
Brazilian airline  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA , was
detained in Brasilia yesterday for his alleged involvement in
the attempted murder of his son-in-law.  Nene Constantino, as he is known, was detained together
with a former military policeman who is accused of committing
the crime in June 2008, according to an e-mailed statement from
the civil police department. Constantino is the father of Gol
Chief Executive Officer  Constantino de Oliveira Jr .  Marcelo de Bessa, a lawyer representing Constantino, didn’t
immediately return a call left with his secretary in Brasilia
today. A Gol official in Sao Paulo declined to comment by phone
because Constantino doesn’t work for the company.  Eduardo Queiroz Alves, Constantino’s son-in-law, was
exiting a garage in his vehicle when an unidentified man, who
was standing at a bus stop, approached the moving car and shot
at him from a meter away, according to the civil police e-mail.
Queiroz Alves was unharmed.  Gol  fell  3.3 percent to 24.89 reais in Sao Paulo. The
shares have fallen 4.6 percent this year, compared with a 1.9
percent drop in Brazil’s benchmark  Bovespa index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
