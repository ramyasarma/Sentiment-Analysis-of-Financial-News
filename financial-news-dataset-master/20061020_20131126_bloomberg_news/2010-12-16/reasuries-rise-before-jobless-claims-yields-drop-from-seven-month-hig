Treasuries  rose, pushing 10-year
note yields down from a seven-month high, before reports on
initial jobless claims and manufacturing that are forecast to
show evidence of economic weakness.  U.S.  debt  advanced for the first time in three days on
speculation an unemployment rate of 9.8 percent will encourage
the Federal Reserve to maintain debt purchases to sustain the
economy. Treasuries remained higher as demand fell at Spain’s
debt sale a day after Moody’s Investors Service said it may cut
the nation’s credit rating.  “The market is positioning for slightly weaker data,”
said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole SA in London. “There’s still a lot of uncertainty
about growth in the U.S.”  The yield on the 10-year note fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 3.48 percent at 7:41 a.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 rose 14/32, or $4.38
per $1,000 face amount, to 92 7/8. The yield climbed yesterday
to 3.56 percent, the highest level since May 13.  First-time claims  for unemployment insurance rose to
425,000 during the week ended Dec. 11, from 421,000 in the prior
period, according to the median forecast of 48 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The report from the Labor Department is
due at 8:30 a.m. New York time.  Philadelphia Index  The Philadelphia Fed’s general economic  index , a gauge of
regional manufacturing, fell to 15 this month, from 22.5 in
November, according to the median forecast of 58 economists. A
reading greater than zero signals expansion in eastern
Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.  The Fed said following its Dec. 14 meeting that its
$600 billion of Treasury purchases were aimed at boosting a
recovery that has been “disappointingly slow.”  The central bank will buy $6 billion to $8 billion of
Treasuries maturing from June 2013 to November 2014 today,
according to the New York Fed’s  website .  European Union leaders meet in Brussels today to discuss a
permanent crisis-fighting system. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  has ruled out an increase in the region’s emergency fund.  Spain’s 10-year securities sold today attracted bids
equivalent to 1.67 times the amount on offer, compared with 1.84
at the last auction Nov. 18. The bid-to-cover ratio for the 15-
year bonds was 2.52, compared with 1.44 times in October.  Spain’s Rating  Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday it put Spain’s Aa1
debt rating on review for a possible downgrade. Spain needs to
raise 170 billion euros ($225 billion) next year, Moody’s
estimated.  Gains in Treasuries were tempered before a report from the
Commerce Department at 8:30 a.m. today forecast to show
construction is increasing, showing some areas of the economy
are expanding.  Housing starts  rose 6 percent to a 550,000 annual
rate in November, according to economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “As long as the U.S. data keeps coming out relatively
positive, we could see a further sell-off,” said  Nick Maroutsos , who helps manage the equivalent of $3.5 billion at
Kapstream Capital in Sydney. In addition, “the U.S. balance
sheet is deteriorating, so people are saying they want a premium
to hold that U.S. dollar debt,” he said.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year notes over
2-year debt was near the widest since February on speculation
President  Barack Obama ’s agreement to extend tax cuts will pass
in Congress, supporting growth and increasing the budget
deficit. The spread narrowed to 2.82 percentage points today
after expanding yesterday to 2.89 percentage points, the widest
since Feb. 23.  The difference in yield between 10-year  Treasury  Inflation
Protected Securities and comparable conventional notes showed
money managers expect the consumer price index to increase an
average of 2.31 percent a year in the next decade. The spread
indicated an inflation rate of 1.47 percent on Aug. 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
