Nouriel Roubini, the New York
University economist who predicted the global financial crisis,
said political opposition may prevent additional rounds of
monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve.  With an unemployment rate above 9 percent and economic
growth of less than 3 percent in 2011, the Fed may need to
embark on another round of asset purchases, Roubini said today
in a Bloomberg Television interview on “Surveillance Midday”
with  Tom Keene .  The Fed said last month it will buy $600 billion of
Treasuries through June to boost the economy, a policy that has
been dubbed QE2 for a second round of quantitative easing.
Republican Representative  Ron Paul , who will oversee the central
bank next year, and new members of the Federal Open Market
Committee will be against such actions, he said.  “We may need QE3, but then the politics from Congress and
the internal dynamic of the FOMC may not allow it even if now
growth is still below trend and inflation is still low and
falling,” said Roubini, who is also chairman and co-founder of
Roubini Global Economics in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
