Taiwan’s investment commission at
the economics ministry will meet from 2 p.m. on Dec. 17 to
review AU Optronics Corp.’s application to build a liquid-
crystal display factory in China, Emile Chang, a spokesman for
the commission said in a phone interview today.  AUO, Taiwan’s second-largest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, applied to build a so-called 7.5-generation factory in
China to be closer to makers of televisions and computer
monitors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
