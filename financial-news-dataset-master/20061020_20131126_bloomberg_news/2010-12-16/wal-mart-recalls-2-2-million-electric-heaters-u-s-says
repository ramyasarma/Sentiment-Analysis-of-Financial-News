Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
largest retailer, is recalling about 2.2 million electric
heaters because they may overheat, burn or melt, causing fires,
the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said.  Wal-Mart received 21 complaints about the appliances,
including the Flow Pro, Airtech, Aloha Breeze and Comfort
Essentials Heaters, the CPSC said in a statement today.
Consumers should stop using the heaters immediately and return
them to a store for a full refund, the agency said.  In 11 cases, there was property damage beyond the heaters
themselves, the agency said. Four people were injured, including
three who needed medical attention for burns and smoke
inhalation.  Heating equipment caused 17 percent of U.S. home fire
deaths in 2008, according to the National Fire Protection
Association. More than half the fires resulted from having
heaters too close to flammable objects, the group said.  The heaters were sold exclusively at the chain and they
were tested to comply with U.S. safety standards before being
sold, said Melissa Hill, a spokeswoman for Bentonville,
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart.  “We mandate that our suppliers meet the strictest
government safety standards,” she said. Wal-Mart recalled the
heaters after malfunctions were reported, she said.  The units were made in China and were sold at Wal-Mart
stores throughout the U.S. from December 2001 through October
2009 for about $18, the CPSC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
