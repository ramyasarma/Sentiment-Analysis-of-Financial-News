Arabica coffee, up about 60 percent
in 2010, may rise another 11 percent by the end of the year,
according to technical analysis by  Paul Kavanaugh , a senior
analyst and broker at PFGBest.  The commodity has closed above the 28-day moving average
every day since Dec. 9, a sign that it “is positioning itself
for the move” higher, said Kavanaugh, who used technical
analysis based on moving averages to correctly forecast a jump
for sugar prices in July.  A closing price above the 13-year high reached last month,
would signal a gain to $2.42 a pound, Chicago-based Kavanaugh
said. The most-active contract touched $2.2145 on Nov. 10, the
highest since June 1997.  Yesterday, arabica coffee for March delivery added 0.8
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.175 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. The contract traded at $2.163 at 10:06 a.m.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
