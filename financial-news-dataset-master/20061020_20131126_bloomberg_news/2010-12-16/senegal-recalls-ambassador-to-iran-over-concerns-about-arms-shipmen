Senegal  recalled its ambassador to
Iran, citing “grave concerns” about an illegal shipment of
firearms concealed in shipping containers and confiscated by
customs officials in Lagos in October.  The shipment of rockets, grenades and mortars “undermines
the peace and security of the West African sub-region,”
Senegal’s Foreign Minister Madicke Niang said in an e-mailed
statement today. “The explanations for this affair provided by
the Iranian party have not been sufficient,” he said. Iran
accepted it is the source of the shipment, Nigerian Foreign
Minister Odein Ajumogobia said Nov. 12.  Gambia, Senegal’s neighbor and the country initially
identified as the destination of the shipment, denied the
claims, Agence France-Presse said today. On Nov. 23, Gambia cut
ties with Iran and ordered diplomats out of the country over the
shipment, the news agency reported.  The move comes amid what were growing diplomatic and
economic ties between the Senegal and Iran. On Dec. 12, Iranian
Foreign Affairs Minister  Manouchehr Mottaki  visited the
predominately Islamic West African nation and “conveyed an
explanation” about the arm shipments, the Senegalese statement
said. A day later, Mottaki was fired by Iran’s President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  and replaced with  Ali Akbar Salehi , the atomic
energy chief.  Iran Khodro, the state-owned carmaker, has invested $60
million in a plant outside of the Senegalese capital, Dakar,
which will produce as many as 15,000 vehicles a year, the
company’s export deputy, Yaser Seifvand, said Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
