Australia is expected to forecast a
surplus of about A$3 billion ($3.04 billion) for the 2012-13
fiscal year when the government unveils its mid-year economic
outlook today in Canberra, the Australian Financial Review
reported, without saying where it got the information.  At the same time, the government of Prime Minister Julia
Gillard will also unveil a A$10 billion slump in expected
revenue, the newspaper said.  Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan are set to announce
savings measures worth as much as A$3.4 billion in the next four
years, the Review said.  The drop in revenue will pressure Gillard to reconsider
some of the promises made during this year’s election campaign,
the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
