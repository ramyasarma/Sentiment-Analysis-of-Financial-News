Amer Group Holding, an Egyptian real-
estate company, plans to sell up to 500 million shares in its
initial public offering and private placement, Beltone
Financial, the investment bank managing the sale, said.  Amer will sell the shares at up to 3.6 Egyptian pounds per
share, chief executive officer Alaadin Saba said in an e-mailed
statement today. The share sale represents 30.7 percent of the
company’s capital, he said. The final price will be announced to
the stock market on Nov. 22.  The company said it plans to sell 80 percent of the
offering in a private placement closing Nov. 21 at a range of
2.60 pounds to 3.60 pounds a share. The rest will be sold
publicly at the same price, Saba said. The number of shares sold
will depend on the price investors are willing to pay.  Amer’s share sale, the second in Egypt this year, will
follow Juhayna Food Industries, the country’s biggest producer
of packaged milk, which went public in June. The global
financial crisis halted new offerings in the North African
country 2009 as investors retreated from emerging markets.  Amer Group announced last month the creation of a joint
venture with the Arabtec Holding Co., the biggest publicly
traded builder in the United Arab Emirates, and awarded it a $53
million residential project in Egypt. In addition to its
flagship Porto resorts on the Egyptian Mediterranean and Red
seas, Amer plans to expand to other countries in the Middle
East, including an announced $1 billion resort in Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
