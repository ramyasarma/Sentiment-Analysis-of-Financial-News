The euro weakened for a second day
against the dollar as concern that Ireland will struggle to plug
its budget deficit reduced the appeal of the region’s assets.
Asian  stocks  traded near two-year highs.  The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.3954 as of 5:30 p.m. in
Tokyo and lost 0.6 percent to 113.33 yen. The  MSCI Asia Pacific
Index  rose 0.3 percent to 135.26, a sixth day of gains, after
the U.S. reported a bigger-than-expected pickup in hiring. The
Stoxx Europe 600 was little changed while futures for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.3 percent, following last
week’s 3.6 percent jump in the U.S. stock gauge.  Europe’s currency weakened versus 13 of its 16 major
counterparts before European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  arrives in Dublin today to look at
Ireland’s budget plan. The extra yield investors demand to hold
Irish debt rather than German bunds surged to a record last week,
while Portugal’s spread is near a euro-era high.  “Sovereign debt concerns in Europe may have a short-term
effect on market sentiment but any fallout there should be
reasonably contained,” said  Ng Soo Nam , Singapore-based chief
investment officer at Nikko Asset Management Co., which has $123
billion in assets globally.  Rehn will be in Dublin for two days after Ireland’s
government laid out a plan last week to cut spending and raise
taxes by as much as 6 billion euros ($8.4 billion) in 2011. He
is due to hold a press conference with Irish Finance Minister
 Brian Lenihan  at 8 p.m. today in Dublin.  ‘Worried’  The  difference  in yield, or spread, between 10-year Irish
bonds and similar-maturity benchmark German bunds rose to 521
basis points on Nov. 5 from 237 points on Aug. 6, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “People are a little bit worried about sovereign debt in
Greece, Ireland and Portugal,” said  Derek Mumford , a Sydney-
based director at Rochford Capital, a currency and rates risk
management firm. “Certainly there has been some selling-off of
the euro and buying of the U.S. dollar.”  That also sent the Australian dollar down to $1.0126 from
$1.0159 on Nov. 5, when it climbed to $1.0183, the strongest
since exchange controls were scrapped in 1983.  The  MSCI Asian index  of shares climbed 4.2 percent last
week, the weekly biggest gain of 2010, and was today headed for
its best close since July 2008. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
rose 1.1 percent while the  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  was
poised to close at a record high.  Stocks Rally  The S&P 500  index  climbed to a two-year high on Nov. 5
after the Labor Department said payrolls climbed by 151,000 in
October, the first gain in five months and more than was
predicted by all 83 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
Federal Reserve last week unveiled plans to buy $600 billion of
Treasuries through June, expanding record stimulus, a move that
has improved the outlook for growth in the world’s biggest
economy, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “The U.S. economy is in better shape than when the Fed
first announced its new quantitative easing measures,” said
 Prasad Patkar , who helps manage about $1.8 billion at Platypus
Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “The solid payroll numbers may
be another indication that it’s coming out of its soft patch. A
strong U.S. economy is immensely helpful in supporting growth
around the world.”  Honda Motor Co. , which sells five vehicles in North America
for every two it sells in Asia Pacific, gained 3.3 percent.  Sony
Corp. , the maker of Bravia televisions and PlayStation game
consoles, gained 1.1 percent.  Qantas Falls  Qantas Airways Ltd.  lost 2.1 percent, leading Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index lower, as the carrier extended the grounding
of its Airbus SAS A380 fleet after finding “anomalies” in three
engines it checked following last week’s explosion that forced
an emergency landing in Singapore.  Goldman Sachs, which warned a month ago that the U.S.
economic outlook was “fairly bad” at best, said the Fed’s
decision to increase bond purchases will spur growth. The Fed
bought $1.7 trillion of assets between December 2008 and March
of this year to help end a recession.  “Downside risks to the economic outlook have declined
significantly,”  Jan Hatzius , Goldman’s New York-based chief U.S.
economist, wrote in an e-mail to clients. “As we move through
2011, the lagged effects of the renewed monetary easing combined
with a gradual slowdown in the pace of private deleveraging
should result in a substantial pickup in GDP growth.”  Cotton futures rose to records in New York and Zhengzhou
while rubber set new highs in Shanghai and Singapore amid supply
concerns. Palm oil climbed as much as 4.9 percent to the highest
level in more than two years, extending a 10-week rally.  Gold slumped as much as 0.5 percent to $1,386.82 an ounce
after earlier reaching an all-time high of $1,398.60.  To contact the reporter for this story:
