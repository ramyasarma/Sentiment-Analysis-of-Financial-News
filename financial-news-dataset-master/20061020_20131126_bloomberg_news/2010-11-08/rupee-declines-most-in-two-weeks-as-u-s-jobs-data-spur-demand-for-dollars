India’s rupee dropped by the most in
almost two weeks as the dollar extended gains following U.S.
jobs data that beat economists’ forecasts.  The rupee declined for the first time in four days as the
Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against those of
six major trading partners, climbed for a second day. The U.S.
Labor Department reported on Nov. 5 that non-farm payrolls in
October climbed 151,000, more than double the 60,000 predicted
by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Leaders from the Group of 20
nations are due to meet in South Korea on Nov. 11-12.  “The rupee’s decline is more due to the dollar move as the
non-farm payroll data was much stronger than expected,” said
 Priyanka Chakravarty , a Mumbai-based foreign-exchange strategist
at Standard Chartered Plc. “The market is also bracing for a
volatile week especially ahead of the G-20 meeting as the focus
is on whether there will be more protective measures.”  The rupee weakened 0.4 percent to 44.3850 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has gained 5 percent this year as
offshore investors poured a net $26.3 billion into Indian
equities, driving the benchmark Sensex index to a record close
last week.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 46.53
against the dollar in 12 months, compared with expectations of
46.14 on Nov. 4. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets
at a set price and date. India’s financial markets were closed
on Nov. 5 for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
