Inflation in China may exceed 3
percent this quarter driven by rising agricultural products
prices, the China Securities Jouranl reported, citing State
Information Center Chief Economist Fan Jianping.  Increase global liquidity after policy easing in developed
economies may push up commodity prices and excess funds in China
may fuel speculation in agricultural products, Fan was cited as
saying by the newspaper.  The State Information Center is a research unit under the
National Development and Reform Commission.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
