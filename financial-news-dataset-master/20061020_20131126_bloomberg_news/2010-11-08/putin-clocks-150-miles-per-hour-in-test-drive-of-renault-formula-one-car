Prime Minister Vladimir Putin test
drove a Formula One racing car over the weekend, reaching 240
kilometers (150 miles) an hour, Russian state television said.  Putin spent several hours driving a yellow Renault on a
track near St. Petersburg, the Rossiya 24 channel reported.  “Even my old Zaporozhets had more room,” Putin said,
referring to the small Soviet-era passenger car.  Putin, 58, led Russian efforts to win the country’s first
Grand Prix race, striking a deal with Formula One chief Bernie
Ecclestone last month to host annual events in the Black Sea
resort of Sochi from 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
