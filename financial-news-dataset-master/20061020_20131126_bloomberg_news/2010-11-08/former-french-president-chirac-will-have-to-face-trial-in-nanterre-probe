Former French President  Jacques Chirac  has to face trial on charges he gave fictitious City Hall
jobs to supporters during his term as mayor of Paris, a
spokesman for the Nanterre court said.  It’s now up to the prosecutor to decide what the next step
is, said the spokesman, who declined to be identified under
court rules.  Last month, a trial on similar charges in Paris was
postponed until March to allow the probe in nearby Nanterre to
be completed and the two cases combined. Judge Dominique Pauthe
scheduled that trial to start March 7 and conclude April 8.  Chirac will be the first French president to stand trial.
The 77-year-old denies allegations that, while serving as mayor,
he awarded City Hall job contracts to people who worked for his
Rally for the Republic political party. Excluding a two-year
hiatus when he was prime minister, Chirac led Paris from 1977 to
1995. He was elected president that year, giving him immunity
from prosecution until he left office in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
