Sara Lee Corp.  is near an agreement
to sell its North American bakery business to  Grupo Bimbo SAB ,
the world’s largest bread maker, for $900 million to $1 billion,
according to two people with knowledge of the bidding.  A  sale  of the unit, which includes the largest fresh-bread
brand in the U.S., may be announced as soon as this week, said
these people, who declined to be identified as the process isn’t
public. A deal could be delayed or fall through in late stages.
Sara Lee is scheduled to report quarterly  earnings  on Nov. 10.  Sara Lee  had sought more than $1 billion for the bakery
unit in October, down from about $1.5 billion when it first
began to explore a sale a few months earlier, people familiar
with the matter said last month. A final agreement was slowed in
recent weeks over debate about price and some labor costs, said
one of the people.  Bimbo emerged as the likeliest buyer after earlier interest
waned from New York-based Ripplewood Holdings, the owner of
Wonder Bread maker Interstate Bakeries Corp., the people said
last month. The sale of the business accelerates a broader
overhaul of Sara Lee, which is focusing on brands such as its
Jimmy Dean meats.  Monica Breton, a spokeswoman for Grupo Bimbo, declined to
comment, and Downers Grove, Illinois-based Sara Lee couldn’t be
reached for comment. Sara Lee’s  stock  has risen 21 percent this
year, while Bimbo has gained 9.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
