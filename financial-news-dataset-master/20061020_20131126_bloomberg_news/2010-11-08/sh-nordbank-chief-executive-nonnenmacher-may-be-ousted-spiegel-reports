HSH Nordbank AG’s owners, the states
of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, are seeking to oust Chief
Executive Officer Dirk Jens Nonnenmacher, Der Spiegel reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The states have reached an agreement to have Nonnenmacher
removed from office, the magazine said on its website. The state
goverments plan to demand tomorrow that supervisory board
Chairman Hilmar Kopper find a successor, Spiegel said.  HSH Nordbank isn’t aware of any such decision by the
states, company spokesman Rune Hoffmann in Hamburg said by
telephone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
