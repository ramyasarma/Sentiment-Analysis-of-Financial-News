Wheat fell for the first time in
three days in Chicago as investors awaited tomorrow’s U.S.
government report on world grain supply and demand.  December-delivery wheat declined 0.4 percent to $7.26 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 p.m. Paris time.
The contract erased a climb as high as $7.39, the highest price
since Oct. 11.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture is scheduled to release
its latest estimate on supply and demand of grains including
wheat, corn, and soybeans tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. in Washington.
The department may cut its outlook for world wheat stockpiles,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  “I expect a reasonably flat day of trading before
tomorrow’s report,” said  Luke Chandler , London-based head of
agricultural research at Rabobank. Wheat prices “are still at
high levels,” he said.  Global wheat inventories may drop to 173.53 million metric
tons before the 2011 harvest, according to the average estimate
of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. That’s down from
196.53 million tons a year earlier and from the USDA’s October
estimate of 174.66 million tons.  “Were it not for the crop report tomorrow morning, we’d be
adding to long positions,” economist  Dennis Gartman  said in his
daily newsletter. “As it is, we’ll sit tight and wait for the
report.”  ‘Solid Gains’  The most-active wheat contract advanced 1.6 percent last
week as rising prices in the period’s last two days more than
made up for three days of declines at the start.  “The wheat market had some pretty solid gains on Friday,”
Chandler said. “You shouldn’t read too much in lower overnight
trading.”  Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris advanced 0.7 percent to 222.75 euros ($309.93) a ton.  March-delivery corn, the contract with the most open
interest, fell 0.3 percent to $6 a bushel in Chicago. December-
delivery corn, which had the biggest volume, dropped 0.3 percent
to $5.8625.  January-delivery soybeans slipped 0.3 percent to $12.8025 a
bushel, reversing a gain of as much as 0.4 percent.  Rough rice for January delivery rose 0.8 percent to $15.10
per 100 pounds. Rice-growing regions in the Philippines, the
biggest buyer of the grain, received rainfall that worsened crop
losses, the government said. Rain damaged crops in the Cagayan
Valley and Central Luzon regions, the National Disaster Risk
Reduction and Management Council said on its website today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
