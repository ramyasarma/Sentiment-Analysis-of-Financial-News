Crude oil declined from its highest
level in more than two years in New York as the dollar
strengthened against the euro, trimming demand for commodities.  Oil for December delivery was down 66 cents at $86.19 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 9:18 a.m. London time, while the dollar gained 0.9 percent to
trade at $1.3906 against the euro.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
