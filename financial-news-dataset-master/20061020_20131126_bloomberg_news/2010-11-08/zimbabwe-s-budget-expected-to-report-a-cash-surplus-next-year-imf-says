Zimbabwe’s budget is expected to
generate a cash surplus in 2010, supported by efforts to
strengthen policies, the International Monetary Fund said.  “Governance at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is improving,
and the government is working toward strengthening the business
climate,” Vitaliy Kramarenko, the fund’s mission chief to
Zimbabwe said in a statement published on the IMF’s website
following the group’s visit to the capital, Harare, from Oct. 25
to Nov. 3. “Higher gold and platinum prices boosted exports and
government revenues, a significant appreciation of the rand has
eased competitiveness pressures, and favorable weather
conditions have contributed to higher agricultural output.”  The mission recommended Zimbabwe contain its cash budget
spending to $2.5 billion in 2011, saying that under its current
assumptions for commodity prices, the budget will be broadly
balanced in 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
