First Gulf Bank PJSC ’s five-year
bonds may be priced to yield in the low to mid 200 basis-point
level more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, according to three
people familiar with the transaction.  The debt may yield between 3.25 percent and 3.5 percent,
according to the people, who declined to be identified as terms
of the deal aren’t set.  BNP Paribas SA ,  Citigroup Inc .,  Deutsche
Bank AG ,  HSBC Holdings Plc  and National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC
are arranging meetings with investors, two people said Nov. 1.  Sales of debt from borrowers in the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council reached $26.8 billion so far this year from
$26.9 billion in the year-earlier period, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. First Gulf raised $500 million from the
sale of three-year securities last November.  The yield on the 4 percent notes maturing in November 2012
fell 14 basis points to 2.715 percent as of 12:51 p.m. in Dubai,
according to Bloomberg composite prices. The shares fell 0.3
percent to 17.5 dirhams in Abu Dhabi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
