Hedge funds ramped up bullish bets on
oil to the highest level since at least June 2006 as the Federal
Reserve enacted stimulus measures, helping drive crude to a two-
year high and weakening the dollar.  The funds and other large speculators  increased wagers  on
rising crude prices by 8.6 percent in the seven days ended Nov.
2, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
weekly Commitments of Traders report. So-called net-long
positions climbed to a record for the CFTC data available.  The Fed said Nov. 3 it will buy an additional $600 billion
of Treasuries to spur job growth in a second round of
quantitative easing, known as QE2. U.S. payrolls rose more than
forecast in October, the Labor Department said Nov. 5, also
helping boost crude futures.  The Dollar Index,  which tracks the
U.S. currency against those of six major trading partners,
slipped 0.9 percent last week and is down 13 percent since this
year’s June 7 peak.  “It’s all about the dollar being debased,” said  Mike Armbruster , co-founder of Altavest Worldwide Trading in Mission
Viejo, California. “You’re going to see managed money take its
cue from the dollar. If the dollar continues to weaken, you’ll
see them continue to go long oil.”  Oil for December delivery rose $5.42 last week, or 6.7
percent, to settle at $86.85 a barrel on Nov. 5 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the first five-day rally since April. It
gained 21 cents, or 0.2 percent, to settle at $87.06 today on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest since Oct. 8,
2008, when oil closed at $88.95.  Bullish Bets  Net-long positions in oil held by what the CFTC categorizes
as managed money, including hedge funds, commodity pools and
commodity-trading advisers, rose by 15,304 futures and options
combined to 194,128, according to the CFTC report.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Merrill Lynch last
week forecast that oil may return to $100 a barrel for the first
time since the 2008 financial crisis. Oil surged to a record
$147.27 a barrel on July 11, 2008, before plunging 78 percent to
a low of $32.40 on Dec. 19 that year.  Gold futures rose to a record $1,398.70 an ounce last week
before settling at $1,397.70 on Nov. 5 on the Comex in New York,
capping a 3 percent gain for the week. Wheat prices climbed to
the highest level in almost four weeks as the grain for December
delivery settled at $7.2875 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Corn touched a 26-month high of $5.9575 a bushel Nov. 4.  “Whatever QE2 will or won’t do in the economy, it will
cause the price of raw materials to rise,” said  Jennifer Fan ,
portfolio manager with Arrowhawk Commodity Strategies, a hedge
fund in Darien, Connecticut.  Gasoline Prices  Global oil demand will climb by 2.1 million barrels a day
to 86.9 million this year and to 88.2 million in 2011, the
Paris-based International Energy Agency said on Oct. 13. Spare
production capacity of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries dropped to about 5.8 million barrels a day last month,
from a seven-year high of 6.8 million in March 2009, according
to a Bloomberg survey of oil companies, producers and analysts.  Petroleum prices were further supported as Saudi Arabia’s
Oil Minister  Ali Al-Naimi  said on Nov. 1 that a range between
$70 and $90 a barrel is satisfactory for consumers. The kingdom
had previously indicated a preferred target of $75 a barrel.  Crude may increase this week on the dollar’s weakness, a
Bloomberg News survey showed. Twenty-nine of 49 analysts and
traders, or 59 percent, said oil will rise through Nov. 12.
Thirteen respondents, or 27 percent, predicted prices will fall
and seven estimated there would be little change.  Heating Oil  In other markets, bullish, or long, bets on  gasoline  prices
declined 1.9 percent to 50,759, the CFTC data showed. Net-long
bets on  heating oil  fell for a fourth week, retreating by 4,832,
or 13 percent, to 32,452.  Net-long  positions in futures and options combined in four
natural-gas contracts surged by 15,232.5 futures equivalents, or
71 percent, to 36,613.75 in the week ended Nov. 2, the CFTC
report also showed.  The measure of natural-gas net longs includes an index of
four contracts adjusted to futures equivalents: Nymex natural
gas futures, Nymex Henry Hub Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate
Swaps and ICE Henry Hub Swaps. Henry Hub, in Erath, Louisiana,
is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark price for
the fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
