A Saudi Arabian court sentenced a man
to five years in prison and 500 lashes for having sexual
relations with another man, Jeddah-based  Okaz  reported.  The 27 year-old man, who was arrested by the kingdom’s
religious police, was also convicted of publishing photos on the
internet and on mobile phones of himself wearing women’s
underwear, the newspaper reported without giving his name. The
court fined him 50,000 riyals ($13,300), the newspaper said.  Saudi Arabia adheres to a strict version of Islam.
Homosexuality is illegal and the kingdom’s courts often sentence
people to death by public beheading for crimes such as rape,
murder and drug trafficking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
