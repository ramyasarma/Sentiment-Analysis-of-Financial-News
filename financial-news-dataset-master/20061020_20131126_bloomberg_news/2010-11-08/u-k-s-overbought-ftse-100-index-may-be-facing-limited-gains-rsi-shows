The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index  is nearing
“overbought” levels, indicating gains may be limited in the
coming days, according to the Relative Strength Index.  The FTSE 100’s 14-day RSI, which tracks momentum by
comparing closing prices with daily trading ranges, was at 67.5
as of 11:27 a.m. in London. When the RSI rises above 70,
technical analysts say the underlying security is “overbought”
and likely to fall. The measure last closed above 70 on April 6,
2010, after which the FTSE 100 slid 17 percent through July 1.  “The RSI rising to an overbought level in an uptrend
environment means investors shouldn’t buy stocks before the
market consolidates,” said  Achim Matzke , head of global index
and technical research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “It is
not a signal to sell in the short term. The indicator will fall
again as the uptrend is intact.”  The  FTSE 100  rose to the highest level in more than two
years last week as the Federal Reserve announced an additional
$600 billion of bond purchases to bolster the world’s largest
economy. The index dropped 0.3 percent to 5,860.11 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
