Florida Attorney General Bill
McCollum, who is investigating foreclosure practices, has met
with the five mortgage companies he called on to “redeem the
integrity” of home seizures in the state.  McCollum wrapped up the round of meetings last week after
speaking with representatives of  Ally Financial Inc.  and  PNC
Financial Services Group Inc. , said Ryan Wiggins, a spokeswoman
for McCollum, in an interview today. She declined to comment
about the details of the meetings.  “Our discussions with the banks are ongoing,” she said.  McCollum sought the meetings last month following
complaints that banks were using flawed documents in foreclosure
cases. In an Oct. 12 letter to the companies, McCollum demanded
meetings to “discuss ways to promptly and effectively redeem
the integrity” of foreclosures.  Besides Ally and PNC, McCollum previously met or spoke by
phone with  Bank of America Corp. ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ’s Litton Loan Servicing LP, Wiggins
said. The meetings come as attorneys general in all 50 states
are investigating foreclosure practices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
