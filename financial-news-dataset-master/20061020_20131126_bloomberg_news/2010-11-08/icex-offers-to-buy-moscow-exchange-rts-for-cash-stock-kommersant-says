The Micex Stock Exchange, Russia’s
largest bourse by volume, offered to buy Moscow rival RTS,
Kommersant reported, citing unidentified RTS shareholders
approached by Micex.  Micex offered to buy 20 percent of RTS for $150 million and
the remaining 80 percent via a share swap, the Moscow-based
newspaper reported today. The offer was made the same day RTS
declared its intention to hold an initial public offering,
Kommersant reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
