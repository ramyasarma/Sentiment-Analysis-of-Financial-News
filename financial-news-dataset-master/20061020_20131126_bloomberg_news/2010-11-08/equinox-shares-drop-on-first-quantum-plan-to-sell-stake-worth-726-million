Equinox Minerals Ltd. , owner of
Africa’s largest copper mine, fell the most in 13 months in
Sydney trading after largest shareholder  First Quantum Minerals
Ltd.  said it would sell its C$729 million ($726 million) stake.  Equinox’s dropped as much as 6 percent to A$5.97, the
biggest decline since Oct. 2, 2009. The Perth-based company,
which has its primary listing in Toronto, traded at A$6.07 at
10:46 a.m. in Sydney.  First Quantum said it will use the  proceeds  from the sale
of its 16 percent stake to advance its own growth projects,
including the Kevitsa nickel-copper project in Finland and the
Ravensthorpe nickel mine in Australia, which is scheduled to
start output next year.  RBC Capital Markets and BMO Capital Markets Ltd. will
manage the sale of about 113.8 million shares, First Quantum
said in a Marketwire statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
