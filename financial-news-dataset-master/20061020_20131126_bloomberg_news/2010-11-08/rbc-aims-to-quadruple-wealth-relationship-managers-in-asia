Royal Bank of Canada  aims to more
than quadruple the number of relationship managers at its Asian
wealth management business to as many as 300 within three to
four years, a senior executive said.  Frank Mu, chief executive officer of RBC Wealth Management,
Asia, made the remarks in a phone interview today after
Toronto-based RBC said it bought  Fortis Bank SA/NV ’s wealth
management business in Hong Kong.  Following the acquisition of Fortis Wealth Management Hong
Kong Ltd., RBC Wealth Management’s staff in Asia increased by 50
people to 226, of whom 65 are relationship managers. Financial
terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
