U.K. stocks  advanced after Barclays
Plc said its capital ratio remained strong and higher metals
prices boosted raw-materials companies.  Barclays, Britain’s third-largest bank, gained 4 percent.
 Rio Tinto Group , the world’s third-biggest mining company,
advanced to the highest level in more than two years.  Schroders
Plc , Europe’s largest publicly traded asset-management company
by market value, rose 5.5 percent after profit beat estimates.  The  FTSE 100  climbed 25.23, or 0.4 percent, to 5,875.19 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge rallied 3.5 percent
last week to the highest level in two years as the Federal
Reserve pledged to buy more securities to boost the recovery.
The FTSE All- Share Index  climbed 0.5 percent today, while
Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  surged 1.9 percent as  CRH Plc  advanced.  “At least for now, the bulls have the upper hand,” said
 Giles Watts , the head of equities at City Index Ltd. in London.
“Investors seem confident that last week’s glut of news has
underpinned the market in the short term.”  The FTSE 100 is trading near its most expensive level
relative to estimated earnings since April, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Barclays gained 4 percent to 297 pence after saying its
capital ratio remained “strong” as quarterly profit declined
76 percent.  ‘A Lot Better’  Barclays’s capital ratio “is a lot better than people will
expect and should be taken really well by the market,” wrote
 Michael Helsby , an analyst at BofA Merrill Lynch, who has a
“buy” rating on the stock. The Core Tier 1 ratio was 10
percent, unchanged from the first half, Barclays said.  Rio Tinto rose 2.8 percent to 4,454 pence, the highest
level since July 2008.  Xstrata Plc  climbed 3.1 percent to
1,407.5 pence. Copper, lead, nickel and tin prices advanced on
the London Metal Exchange.  Schroders rose 5.5 percent to 1,667 pence, the highest
level in more than 12 years, after third-quarter pretax profit
and net inflows beat expectations.  Randgold Resources Ltd., a producer of the metal in West
Africa, rallied 4.6 percent to 6,265 pence, after saying third-
quarter profit more than doubled after prices of the precious
metal rose.  InterContinental Hotels Group Plc  sank 5.2 percent to 1,140
pence as the owner of the Holiday Inn brand said third-quarter
operating profit fell 7 percent to $115 million, excluding
exceptional items.  Yell Group Plc  slumped 21 percent to 12.37 pence. The
publisher of the U.K.’s yellow pages directories said first-half
sales dropped 8.9 percent to 895.7 million pounds ($1.45
billion). The company also said  Michael Pocock  will take over as
chief executive officer from Jan. 1.  In Dublin, CRH gained 4.4 percent to 14.47 euros after
saying the pace of revenue decline slowed in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
