Silver prices are “over-extended”
and there is a “possibility of a sharp correction” at least
towards $23 an ounce, Standard Bank Plc said in a report dated
Nov. 5.  “In its current mood though, any such dip would be likely
to find buyers,” the bank said. The metal traded at $26.63 at
9:02 a.m. in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
