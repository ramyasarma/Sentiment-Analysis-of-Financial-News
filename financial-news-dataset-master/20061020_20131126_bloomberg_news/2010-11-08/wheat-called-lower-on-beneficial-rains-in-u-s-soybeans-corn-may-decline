What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures are called to open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of
Trade and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange as rains this week may
aid some crops in the U.S. Great Plains, said  Chad Henderson , a
market analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield, Wisconsin.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents lower in Chicago
on speculation that a rebound by the dollar will curtail
investment demand for commodities, Henderson said. Soybean-meal
futures may open $2 to $3 lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean
oil is expected to open little changed.  -- Corn futures are called 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT as farmers increase sales after last week’s rally to a
two-year high, Henderson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
