Copper climbed for a third day,
approaching a 28-month high, as investors sought alternatives to
a declining dollar amid concerns supplies from Chile, the
world’s largest producer, may be disrupted.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.9 percent to $8,735 a metric ton, and
traded at $8,695 a ton by 9:05 a.m. Singapore time. Copper
advanced to $8,769.50 a ton on Nov. 5, the highest price since
July 2008.  Futures in Shanghai declined for the first time in four
days as high prices deterred purchases in China, the world’s
largest consumer. The metal for February-delivery on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange fell as much as 0.9 percent to 66,810
yuan a ton, before trading at 67,250 yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
