Power Grid Corp. of India, the
nation’s biggest transmission company, and the federal
government may raise 75.8 billion rupees ($1.7 billion) through
a share offer in a record year for asset sales in the country.  The state-owned company and the government each plan to
sell 420.9 million shares at 85 rupees to 90 rupees apiece in a
secondary offering starting tomorrow, according to an
advertisement in the Times of India newspaper. Power Grid  shares 
fell as much as 5.9 percent today and closed at 98.35 rupees at
in Mumbai trading.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh plans to raise 400 billion
rupees from asset sales this year to help fund the construction
of roads, ports and hospitals, taking advantage of overseas
investments that have helped to push the benchmark  Sensitive
Index  to a record.  Coal India Ltd.  surged 40 percent on its
first trading day after the government raised 152 billion rupees
last month selling a stake in the world’s largest coal producer.  “The price band is reasonable,” said  Jagannadham Thunuguntla , chief strategist at SMC Global Securities Ltd. in
New Delhi. “One can’t expect the same kind of success in the
issue as was in the Coal India IPO. Selling a follow-on public
offer is always a tricky affair as there is competition from the
market price.”  Network Expansion  Power Grid needs  funds  to expand its transmission network
as utilities build generation capacity to reduce blackouts in
the world’s second-most populous nation.  India’s government has pledged to provide electricity
nationwide by 2012 and needs to increase installed generation
capacity to 200,000 megawatts to sustain economic growth,
according to the power ministry. The current  capacity  is 164,836
megawatts.  The company may spend 1 trillion rupees to add 80,000
kilometers (49,720 miles) to its network. The grid’s length was
79,556 kilometers as of Sept. 30, according to the company’s
share-sale  document .  Funds raised in the share sale will be spent on 13
transmission projects, Chairman  S.K. Chaturvedi  said in Mumbai
today.  Individual investors and Power Grid employees will be
eligible for a 5 percent discount to the offer price, according
to the advertisement.  Power Grid may raise as much as 167 billion rupees in the
financial year starting April 1, including loans from the Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank, Finance Director  J. Sridharan  said in Mumbai today.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., ICICI Securities Ltd., JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and SBI Capital Markets are the advisers for the
Power Grid share sale, which closes Nov. 12.  The Sensex index has gained 19 percent this year as foreign
fund inflows rose to a record 1.2 trillion rupees.  Power Grid’s  initial public offering  in September 2007
attracted bids for 65 times the 573.9 million shares available
at 52 rupees apiece and raised 29.8 billion rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
