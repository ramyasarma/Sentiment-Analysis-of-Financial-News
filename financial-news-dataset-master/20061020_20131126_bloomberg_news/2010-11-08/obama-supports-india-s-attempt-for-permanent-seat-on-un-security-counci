The U.S. looks forward to seeing
India as a permanent member of the United Nations Security
Council, President Barack Obama will tell Indian lawmakers in an
address to the parliament.  “The just and sustainable international order that America
seeks includes a United Nations that is efficient, effective,
credible and legitimate,” Obama will say. “That is why I can
say today — in the years ahead - I look forward to a reformed
U.N. Security Council that includes India as a permanent
member.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
