BP Plc  named  Frank L. “Skip” Bowman 
and  Brendan Nelson  non-executive directors to the board as the
company tries to restore its reputation following the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill.  Bowman rose to the rank of Admiral in a 38-year U.S. Navy
career in which he specialized in nuclear reactors. He was a
member of the panel that reviewed safety at BP refineries after
the deadly 2005 Texas City blast.  Nelson served on the U.K. board of KPMG and was vice
chairman when he retired this year. He will become chairman of
BP’s audit committee when Douglas Flint retires following the
2011 annual general meeting.  Bowman “has had a career where safety was central to all
that he did,” BP Chairman  Carl-Henric Svanberg  said in a
statement in London. “We will clearly benefit from his long
safety experience and from his knowledge of BP. Brendan brings
vast financial and auditing experience.”  Nelson is a non-executive director at  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc , where he also is chairman of the audit
committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
