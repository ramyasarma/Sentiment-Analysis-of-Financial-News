Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s biggest
bank, said it has received “a number of” bids for BHF-Bank AG
after newspaper reports of waning interest in the unit.  “We will carefully examine these offers and then decide,
how and with whom we will continue the process,” the Frankfurt-
based bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Financial Times
Deutschland and Handelsblatt reported that Deutsche Bank is
struggling with the sale because of the low number of bids,
without saying where they got the information.  Liechtenstein’s LGT Group is bidding for BHF-Bank, two
people familiar with the process said.  Bankhaus Lampe , the
German lender controlled by the billionaire Oetker family,
decided against handing in a joint bid with Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co., two other people said.  Deutsche Bank started the sale of BHF-Bank in July after
acquiring it through the purchase of asset and wealth manager
Sal. Oppenheim Group. The bank is seeking at least 600 million
euros ($836 million) for the unit, which offers private banking,
asset management and investment banking, a person familiar with
the matter said at the time.  Officials at LGT, Bankhaus Lampe and KKR declined to
comment and Deutsche Bank wouldn’t identify bidders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
