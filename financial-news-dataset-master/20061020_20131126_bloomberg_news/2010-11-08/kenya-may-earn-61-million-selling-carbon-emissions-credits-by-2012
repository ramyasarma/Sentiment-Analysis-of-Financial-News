Kenya aims to register 17 projects
with the United Nations by 2012, supplying the East African
nation with 2.9 million carbon credits, said Erastus Wahome,
chief economist in the Finance Ministry’s economic affairs unit.  Revenue from the sale of those UN Certified Emissions
Reductions, or CERs, is expected to reach 43.7 million euros
($61 million), Wahome told a conference today in the capital,
Nairobi.  In Africa, Kenya lags behind South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria
and Tunisia in carbon-trading, due to delays in setting up
regulations because of a lack of technical and financial
resources, Wahome said.  “Carbon trading could help us bring our more than 1
trillion-shilling ($12.4 billion) public debt down to a third of
that over the next six years,” Wahome said in an interview at
the same event. “The potential is there.”  Two Kenyan companies are starting projects under the UN’s
Clean Development Mechanism, which allows businesses in
industrialized nations to buy carbon credits from developing
countries to comply with requirements to reduce emissions.  Mumias Sugar Co.  is generating electricity from sugar by-
products, while  Kenya Electricity Generation Co. , the country’s
biggest power producer, runs geothermal and hydropower plants,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
