Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. , South
Africa’s second-largest grocer, said it will open a store in
Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, in March after signing a
franchise agreement with Retail Masters in the country.  The 3,000 square-meter (9,840 square-foot) outlet will be
followed by three more stores in the greater Maputo district by
the end of 2011, Pick n Pay said in a statement today.  “We have identified numerous opportunities for further
sites and we see enormous potential in the country which we
believe is considerably under-penetrated in terms of the kind of
retail offering we will provide,” Dallas Langman, head of the
Group Enterprises, said in the statement.  Pick n Pay now has stores across most of southern Africa,
having opened its first outlet in Zambia in July and having more
than doubled its stake in TM Supermarkets, which runs 51 shops
in Zimbabwe. The South African grocer also operates 17 stores in
Namibia, 12 in Botswana, seven in Swaziland and one in Lesotho.  Shares  in Pick n Pay rose for a 13th day, adding 53 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to 49.34 rand at 10:42 a.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
