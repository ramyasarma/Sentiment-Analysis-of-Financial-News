India’s benchmark stock index fell
from a record amid concern the rally that made the shares Asia’s
most expensive was excessive in relation to the outlook for
corporate earnings.  HDFC Bank Ltd.,  the third-biggest, dropped for the first
time in eight days, leading a decline in financial stocks.  Power
Grid Corp. of India Ltd. , the biggest transmission company,
declined the most in more than six months after saying it will
sell shares to some investors at a discount.  “Some investors are taking money off the table as the run-
up has been pretty good,” said  Sadanand Shetty , a Mumbai-based
fund manager at Taurus Asset Management Co., which manages $665
million in assets. “Even a small correction will make the
markets and stocks more attractively valued.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
lost 152.58, or 0.7 percent, to 20,852.38, as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. Three stocks climbed for every seven that fell
on the 30-member index. The gauge rose 4.9 percent last week,
its steepest climb since the five-days ended July 17, 2009.  Stocks on the Sensex are valued at  19.9 times  earnings
after jumping 19 percent this year, the best performance and
making it the most expensive among the world’s 10 biggest stock
markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fund Flows  The Sensex’s 14-day relative strength index, measuring how
rapidly prices rose or fell during the specified period, settled
at 68.5 on Nov. 5, near the 70 level some investors see as a
signal to sell. The index’s price-earnings ratio exceeds the
13.8 multiple for Brazil’s  Bovespa Index , 8.2 for Russia’s  Micex
Index  and 17.9 for China’s  Shanghai Composite Index , among the
so-called BRIC markets.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
dropped 0.6 percent to 6,273.20. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.4
percent to 2,648.62.  Foreign fund inflows have surged 80 percent to an all-time
high on the expectation consumer spending will boost corporate
earnings. Overseas  investors  bought a net  12.97 billion rupees 
($292 million) of Indian equities on Nov. 3, extending this
year’s record inflows to 1.22 trillion rupees, according to data
on the  website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  Bank Shares  HDFC Bank decreased 2.4 percent to 2,335.4 rupees, its
sharpest drop since June 25.  Housing Development Finance Corp. ,
the biggest mortgage lender, slid 1.6 percent to 726.2 rupees.
Its shares are valued at 28.2 times estimated profit.  ICICI Bank
Ltd. , the country’s second-biggest lender, lost 1.4 percent to
1,255.3 rupees, while its larger rival  State Bank of India  fell
1.9 percent to 3,425.15 rupees.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Bankex Index dropped for the
first time in seven days. The gauge added 7.5 percent last week,
its steepest climb since the five-days ended Oct. 16, 2009.  “Valuations are a concern,” said  Kishor Ostwal , managing
director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., a publicly traded
equities research provider in Mumbai.  Power Grid lost 3.6 percent to 98.35 rupees, its lowest
close since May 2009. The state-run company will sell shares for
between 80 rupees and 90 rupees apiece starting tomorrow, the
state-owned company said in an advertisement in the Economic
Times newspaper. Power Grid employees and individual investors
will be eligible to buy the stock for 5 percent less than the
offer price, it said.  Reliance Power Ltd.  surged 4.4 percent to 172.1 rupees, its
steepest climb since Oct. 5. Billionaire  Anil Ambani ’s company
yesterday said it arranged a $5 billion line of credit from the
Export-Import Bank of the U.S. to fund renewable energy and gas
plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
