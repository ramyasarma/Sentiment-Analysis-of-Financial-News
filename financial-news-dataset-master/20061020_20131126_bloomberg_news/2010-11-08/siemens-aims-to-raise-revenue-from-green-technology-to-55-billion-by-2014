Siemens AG , Europe’s largest
engineering company, aims to grow its sales from so-called green
products designed to save energy to 40 billion euros ($55
billion) by 2014.  Revenue  from environmental products totaled about 28
billion euros in the fiscal year through September, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today. The company had previously
targeted revenue of at least 25 billion euros by 2011.  Siemens’ competitor  General Electric Co.  said it will
invest about $10 billion in environmentally friendly products by
2015 through his five-year-old “ecomagination” program.
Connecticut-based GE has a revenue goal for the program of $20
billion by 2010, with $18 billion in sales generated last year.  “We want to -- and we will -- increase our advantage over
our most important competitors,” Management Board member  Barbara Kux  said in the statement.  Munich-based Siemens claims a leading position in
technology for offshore wind farms, with more than 500 turbines
installed, as well as solar thermal energy, advanced electricity
grids, and water purification systems.  At 2.3 billion euros, the renewable-energy unit generated
the highest new  orders  among the company’s 14 divisions in the
quarter ended June 30. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Siemens
will report “strong volume growth” for both order intake and
sales of the unit, Chief Executive Officer  Joe Kaeser  said on
Sept. 27 on a telephone conference for analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
