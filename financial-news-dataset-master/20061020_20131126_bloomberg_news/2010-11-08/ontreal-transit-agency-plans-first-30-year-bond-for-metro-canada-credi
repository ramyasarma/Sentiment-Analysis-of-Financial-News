Montreal’s transit agency plans to
borrow as much as C$300 million ($300 million) by year-end, the
first step in a C$11.9 billion investment program to modernize
its subway and bus network during the next decade.  Societe de Transport de Montreal, as the agency is known,
may borrow as much as C$1.2 billion annually in the next several
years, including its first sale of 30-year bonds, said Chief
Financial Officer  Luc Tremblay .  STM wants to modernize equipment and expand service to cope
with an expected 40 percent increase in passengers in the next
decade and make up for years of under-investment. Canada’s
second-biggest city is using rubber-tire trains that were built
in the 1960s and 1970s.  “Most of our assets have reached the end of their
lifespan, so we have to replace them,” Tremblay said in a
telephone interview.  STM’s net debt of about C$500 million is guaranteed by the
City of Montreal and 15 other municipalities in the region.
Moody’s Investors Service rates STM’s long-term debt Aa2, its
third-highest rating. Standard & Poor’s has an A+ rating on the
bonds.  STM plans to tap the North American market to sell its
bonds, Tremblay said.  “Conditions right now on the markets are very good,” he
said. “In the short term we aren’t seeing any negative factors.
This is why we will probably move rapidly.”  STM’s 4.5 percent bond due in December 2020 has returned
5.42 percent since it was issued in July, beating the 4.3
percent return of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Canadian
Provincial and Municipal Index in the same period.  Credit Markets  Elsewhere in Canada’s credit markets, the extra yield
investors demand to hold corporate bonds instead of federal
government securities narrowed last week. Yield spreads on
Canada’s company debt closed Nov. 5 at 141 basis points, or 1.41
percentage points, compared with 142 basis points on Oct. 29,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.  The so-called spread in U.S. corporate bonds narrowed 1
basis point last week to 176 basis points, while global
corporate bonds widened 1 basis point to 165 basis points.  Canadian corporate yields ended the week at 3.67 percent,
compared with 3.62 percent Oct. 29, according to the Merrill
index, which holds more than 700 bonds with a par value of C$279
billion. The index declined 0.1 percent last week, bringing the
year-to-date gain to 7.7 percent.  10-Year Notes  Canada’s benchmark 10-year note’s yield rose 4 basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.85 percent last week. The
price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June 2020 fell 38
cents to C$105.40. The yield advanced two basis points to 2.87
percent today.  Canada’s government bonds have lost investors 0.2 percent
this month, paring the gain this year to 7 percent, according to
a Merrill index.  Canadian 10-year bonds yielded 32 basis points more than
their U.S. counterparts Nov. 5, near the widest gap in Canada’s
favor since January 2009. The spread touched 37 basis points on
Oct. 7.  Canadian  housing starts  fell in October by the most since
April 2009, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. reported today.  Starts declined 9.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
pace of 167,900 from a revised 185,000 in September, Canada
Mortgage said from Ottawa. The figure trailed all 21 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey, which had a median forecast of
183,000.  Manulife Notes  Manulife Financial Corp. ’s Manulife Bank of Canada unit
sold C$165 million of bonds due in November 2011, with a
floating-rate coupon set monthly at 35 basis points greater than
the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate known as CDOR.  Financement-Quebec, which seeks loans on behalf of schools,
universities and hospitals in Canada’s second most populous
province, reoffered C$230 million of its bonds due in June 2016.
The floating-rate coupon will be set quarterly at 27 basis
points greater than CDOR. The issue has C$1.28 billion
outstanding.  STM awarded  Bombardier Inc . and Alstom SA a C$1.2 billion
order last month to build 468 cars for its subway system, known
as the metro. Deliveries are due to start in February 2014 and
run until September 2018. When the cost of a new maintenance
center and other investments is factored in, the STM’s cash
outlay will be close to C$2.4 billion, Tremblay said.  Payments to Bombardier and  Alstom  will be spread out over
10 years, “so we won’t need to borrow C$2.4 billion in one
shot,” Tremblay said.  Capital Spending  Instead, Tremblay said STM plans to raise C$250 million to
C$300 million “three or four times a year” starting in 2011.
The agency can tap a C$100 million secured bank line and a
commercial paper program of C$500 million to meet short-term
liquidity needs, he said.  Quebec’s government subsidizes at least half of major STM
investments such as station renovations and bus purchases. For
the subway-car contract, the province will reimburse 75 percent
of the principal and interest payments, Tremblay said.  Besides subway cars, STM also plans to invest in new buses,
a real-time information system for passengers and various
station repairs in the next decade, Tremblay said. The company
expects to have about 2,200  buses  in its fleet by 2020, about
600 more than it now has, he said.  STM “continues to face large and increasing capital
spending requirements in the next five to 10 years to revitalize
its aging infrastructure,” said Greg Moore, an analyst with
Standard & Poor’s in Toronto.  The agency will probably sell its first 30-year bonds to
pay for the subway cars, Tremblay said.  “We try to match the bonds with the life span of the
assets we want to finance,” he said. “For the metro cars, we
are not going to finance them over 10 or 20 years as we normally
do. Thirty-year bonds are a better fit.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
