Exxon Mobil Corp.  and its partners
plan to build four artificial islands in the Upper Zakum oil
field off Abu Dhabi that could result in cost savings of several
billion dollars, an Exxon executive said today.  Construction and use of the islands may allow for the
removal of almost 100 wellhead towers in the sea and may save
the project more than $1 billion and less than $15 billion, said
Morten Mauritzen, president of Exxon Mobil Abu Dhabi Offshore
Petroleum Co. Mauritzen was speaking at an event in Abu Dhabi,
the capital of the United Arab Emirates.  The cost savings would come over the 25 years remaining for
commercial production at Upper Zakum, where Zakum Development
Co. project, known also as Zadco, is pumping crude. State-run
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc, has a 60 percent stake in
Zadco, with Exxon Mobil holding 28 percent and Japan Oil, a unit
of  Inpex Corp. , owning the rest.  Zadco plans a $15 billion artificial islands project to
boost production at the field by about 40 percent to 750,000
barrels a day. Building islands is cheaper than erecting
offshore production platforms, Salah Al-Bufalah, Zadco’s
major projects manager, said last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
