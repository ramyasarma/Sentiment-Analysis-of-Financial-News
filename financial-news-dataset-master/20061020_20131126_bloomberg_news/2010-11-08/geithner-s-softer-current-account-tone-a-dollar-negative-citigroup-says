U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner ’s apparently softer tone on a proposal for current-
account targets before a summit of the Group of 20 this week may
weigh on the dollar, Citigroup Inc. said.  “Geithner this weekend suggested that G-20 nations were
unlikely to agree on indicative current-account targets,”  Todd Elmer , a Singapore-based currency strategist, wrote today in a
note to investors. “This shift in rhetoric represents a modest
dollar negative since it suggests the status quo which has
resulted in trend dollar weakening is likely to remain in
place.”   The dollar strengthened 0.7 percent to $1.3939 as of 7:04
a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
