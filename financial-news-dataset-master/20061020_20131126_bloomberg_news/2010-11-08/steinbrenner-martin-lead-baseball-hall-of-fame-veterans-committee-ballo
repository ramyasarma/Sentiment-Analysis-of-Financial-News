George Steinbrenner  and  Billy Martin ,
linked through repeated hirings and firings as owner and manager
of the New York Yankees, headline a 12-candidate veterans
committee ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame.  Steinbrenner, who died in July, and Martin, a five-time
manager of the Yankees and a former second baseman for the team,
are joined by 10 former Major League Baseball players, managers
and executives whose most significant contribution to the game
came during the expansion era that began in 1973, the Hall of
Fame said today in a statement.  The candidates will be voted on by a 16-member panel during
baseball’s winter meetings next month, with the results released
Dec. 6. Any candidate who receives votes on 75 percent of the 16
ballots will be inducted with the 2011 class.  Steinbrenner owned the Yankees from 1973 until his death
from a heart attack in July. In his 37 years as owner, the team
won 11 pennants and seven World Series titles. Martin, who died
in 1989, managed the Yankees for parts of eight seasons, winning
the World Series in 1977. In his 16 seasons as manager of the
Yankees, Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers, Texas Rangers and
Oakland Athletics, Martin was 1,253-1,013, with two American
League pennants and a World Series title.  Other candidates include former players union leader  Marvin Miller , former New York Mets outfielder  Rusty Staub , and Yankees
pitcher  Ron Guidry , who won World Series titles in 1977 and
1978.  The veterans committee operates on a three-year cycle,
considering long-retired players, managers and executives from
three different eras for induction into the Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, New York. The committee will vote on Golden Era
(1947-72) candidates in 2011 and Pre-Integration Era (1871-1946)
candidates in 2012. Expansion Era candidates will be eligible
again in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
