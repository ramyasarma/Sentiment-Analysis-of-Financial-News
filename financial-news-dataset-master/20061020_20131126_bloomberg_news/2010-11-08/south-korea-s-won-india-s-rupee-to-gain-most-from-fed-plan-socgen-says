The currencies of South Korea and
India will benefit the most as the Federal Reserve’s additional
stimulus spurs demand for stocks in countries with higher
yields, according to Societe Generale SA.  The won will advance 15.5 percent to 950 per dollar and the
rupee will climb 7 percent to 43 by November 2011 based on non-
deliverable forward prices,  Cliff Tan , managing director and
head of SocGen’s foreign-exchange research, said in an interview
late last week. South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index rose 0.3
percent and India’s Sensitive Index of shares rallied 2.1
percent on Nov. 4, a day after the U.S. Fed said it would inject
$600 billion to support growth in the world’s largest economy.  “One of the key asset-price effects of a second round of
quantitative easing is going to be in the equity markets,” Hong
Kong-based Tan said. “In this region, I think that most
prominently features Korea and India.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards on the won were at
1,123.79 per dollar as of 11:11 a.m. in Seoul and those on the
rupee at 46.24. The Korean currency traded at 1,115.01, while
India’s currency was at 44.3050.  The won and the rupee have appreciated 4.4 percent and 5
percent, respectively, this year as overseas investors poured a
combined $42 billion into stocks of the two nations. Benchmark
interest  rates  of 2.25 percent in South Korea and 5.25 percent
in India give investors a yield advantage over the U.S., where
policy rates are close to zero.  ‘Quite Stretched’  Tan forecasts that “strong” equity flows into the two
Asian nations will add pressure on policy makers to raise
interest rates to contain rising prices.  Inflation  in South
Korea reached a 20-month high of 4.1 percent in October and has
averaged 9.7 percent in India this year. Indian Finance Minister
 Pranab Mukherjee  said Oct. 26 the pace of price gains is still
double the “ideal” level.  “They are going to need to take out some insurance by
hiking interest rates to prevent that from getting out of
hand,” Tan said. “I think all that will support the
currency.”  The won will trade at 1,039 per dollar by the end of 2011
and the rupee at 43.45, according to the median forecasts of
analysts in separate Bloomberg surveys.  The potential for appreciation in Thailand’s baht and the
Philippine peso is limited as recent gains mean those currencies
are “quite stretched,” Tan said. The baht has advanced 12.3
percent this year, Asia’s best performance excluding the yen,
while the peso has climbed 7.8 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Frances Yoon
