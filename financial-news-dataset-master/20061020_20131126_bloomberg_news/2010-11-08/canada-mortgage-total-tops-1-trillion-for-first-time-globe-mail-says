Canada’s total of outstanding
residential mortgages rose 7.6 percent in the 12 months to the
end of August, the Globe & Mail reported, citing the annual
report of the Canadian Association of Mortgage Professionals,
released today.  The total exceeded $1 trillion for the first time this
year, as higher home prices meant many people borrowed larger
amounts and low interest rates persuaded others to refinance,
the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
