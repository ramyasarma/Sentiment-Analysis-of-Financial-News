Protectionism is the “greatest
danger” to the world economy and nations are not taking
sufficient measures to ensure “genuinely free trade,” German
Chancellor Angela Merkel told the Financial Times in an
interview.  Completing the Doha round of world trade talks would help
address the issue and would be a move that “does not cost us
much, and does not create any new debts,” Merkel said,
according to the FT.  China must be persuaded with “facts and benchmarks” to
set a “fair exchange rate” for the yuan instead of being
criticized for its currency policy, said Merkel, who also
dismissed a U.S. plan to set specific targets for maximum levels
of balance of payments’ surpluses and deficits as “too
narrowly conceived,” the FT reported.  Exchange rates should reflect the strength of a nation’s
economy, Merkel said.      If all members of the Group of 20 leading economies agreed
to implement the new Basel III bank capital rules, a “a genuine
crisis prevention mechanism,” would be created, Merkel also
told the FT.  Merkel does not have a “fear” for a double-dip recession
in Germany, and neither for the world economy, based on
International Monetary Fund forecasts, the FT also reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
