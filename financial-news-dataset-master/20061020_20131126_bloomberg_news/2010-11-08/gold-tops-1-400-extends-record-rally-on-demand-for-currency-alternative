Gold topped $1,400 an ounce,
extending a rally to a record, on investor demand for an
alternative to currencies. Silver reached a 30-year high, and
palladium climbed to the highest price since 2001.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures rose to a record
$1,410.40 as the euro dropped after concerns mounted that
governments in the region will struggle to pay debt. The metal
has jumped 28 percent this year, heading for the 10th straight
annual gain.  “No one wants to hold currencies now,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago. “The big money is looking at gold as an alternative
asset.”  Gold futures for December delivery traded at $1,409.40 as
of 4:30 p.m. in New York, after gaining $5.50, or 0.4 percent,
to settle at $1,403.20 in regular trading. Gold for immediate
delivery jumped as high as $1,410.60, a record.  Ireland is seeking support from the European Union this
week to avoid a Greek-style bailout as investors shunned buying
the country’s bonds. Gold reached a previous record in June when
investors were concerned that Greece would go bankrupt.  “Gold will benefit from any sovereign-debt fallout,” said
 Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago. “Gold is going to continue to be bought on dips
because no one believes the dollar can stage a significant
rally.”  Fed Intervention  Last week, the greenback dropped against a basket of major
currencies to the lowest level since December after the U.S.
Federal Reserve said it would buy $600 billion in bonds to
support the economy.  “The debt load that countries are carrying makes people
want to go into gold,” LaSalle’s Zeman said.  Precious metals will benefit as China invests in more
commodities, Lind-Waldock’s Klopfenstein said. The country has
become the world’s biggest market for commodities-futures
trading, Jiang Yang, the chairman assistant of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, said at a conference in
Guangzhou on Nov. 6.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 68.4 cents, or
2.6 percent, to settle at $27.432 an ounce on the Comex. In
after-hours trading, the price reached $27.735, the highest
level for a most-active contract since March 1980.  Palladium futures for December delivery gained $25.50, or
3.7 percent, to $710.90 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the metal reached $713.95, the highest level
since April 2001. Platinum futures for January delivery rose
$2.20, or 0.1 percent, to $1,771.10 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
