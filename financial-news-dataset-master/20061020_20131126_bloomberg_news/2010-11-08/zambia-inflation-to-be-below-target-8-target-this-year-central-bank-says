Inflation in Zambia, Africa’s biggest
copper producer, will likely stay below the government’s 8
percent target this year because of a bumper crop harvest, Bank
of Zambia Governor  Caleb Fundanga  said.  “This favorable outlook is on account of the expected
stability in maize prices in view of the bumper harvest in 2010
and relative stability of the exchange rate of the kwacha
against the dollar for much of the fourth quarter,” Fundanga
told reporters in the capital, Lusaka, today.  A 12 percent appreciation of the kwacha against the dollar
since June, partly due to a higher copper price, and excess
maize has helped contain inflation. The currency’s gains erased
losses for the first half of the year. Annual inflation slowed
to 7.3 percent in October from 7.7 percent a month earlier. The
price of copper has climbed 43 percent since June.  Zambian copper production increased 31 percent to 232,554
metric tons in the third quarter compared with a year earlier,
Fundanga said. Output rose 17 percent from the second quarter,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
