The Czech government will freeze
spending to prevent the fiscal deficit from exceeding the
approved limit if economic growth next year falls short of
projections and lowers revenue.  Prime Minister  Petr Necas ’ Cabinet pledged to halve the
public-finance  gap  to less than the European Union’s limit of 3
percent of economic output by 2013. It plans to curb the
shortfall, the fiscal benchmark for assessing an EU member’s
readiness to join the euro area, to 4.6 percent of  gross
domestic product  in 2011 from the 5.3 percent target this year.  The Prague-based Finance Ministry on Nov. 1  forecast  2011
GDP growth of 2 percent, down from the 2.3 percent expansion
that served as the basis for calculating next year’s budget. The
central bank on Nov. 4 cut its estimate to 1.2 percent from 1.8
percent due to the expected impact of austerity measures.  “The fiscal target of the government sector deficit of 4.6
percent of GDP won’t be endangered,” Deputy Finance Minister
 Jan Gregor  said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg News
questions today. “Moreover, in case it’s needed, the government
is ready, at the Finance Ministry’s proposal, to freeze state
budget expenditure so that the planned deficit is maintained.”  The ministry’s new GDP forecast differed only marginally
from the macroeconomic framework used as the basis for next
year’s budget and “the impact of the new forecast on the 2011
budget will be negligible,” Gregor said.  Austerity Measures  The government, in office since July, has already frozen
part of budget spending to make sure this year’s shortfall won’t
exceed the target.  The economy, which last year fell into the worst recession
since the end of communism two decades ago, will grow 2.2
percent in 2010, according to the ministry’s estimate. The
central bank forecasts a 2.3 percent expansion. Economic output,
in which exports account for about 70 percent, advanced an
annual 2.4 percent in the three months through June, the fastest
pace in eight quarters.  Plans to narrow the deficit have helped the koruna
strengthen 5.2 percent against the euro since the May 28-29
elections, making it the second-best performer among more than
170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The Czech koruna was little changed to the euro, trading at
24.553 against Europe’s common currency as of 5:35 p.m. in
Prague today. The government’s 3.7 percent bond due in 2013
gained, pushing its yield down 6 basis points to 1.985 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is a
hundredth of a percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
