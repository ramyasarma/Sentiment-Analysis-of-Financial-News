Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan is
seeking to prepare the nation’s agricultural industry for more
open trade as he faces pressure at home and abroad to dismantle
barriers to the economy, the Wall Street Journal reported.   Kan was quoted as saying in an interview that it is his
responsibility as chairman of this week’s meeting of the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to promote free trade. He
said it’s important to achieve a balance between industry reform
and liberalization, the report said.   The average age of agricultural workers, at 65.8, would
make it difficult to sustain the industry with or without trade
liberalization, he was quoted as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
