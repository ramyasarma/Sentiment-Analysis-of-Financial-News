China stocks  rose, sending the
benchmark index to a seven-month high, amid speculation capital
inflows will increase on U.S. quantitative easing and the
central government will succeed in boosting domestic consumption.  Poly Real Estate Group Co.  climbed the most in two weeks
after Caixin cited China Construction Bank Corp.’s chairman as
saying overseas inflows into property have been “formidable.”
 SAIC Motor Corp.  and Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co. gained more than
3 percent after a government economist said consumption will be
a priority in the next five-year plan.  PetroChina Co. , the
country’s largest oil company, added 1.3 percent as oil traded
close to a two-year high.  The  Shanghai Composite Index  gained 30.02, or 1 percent, to
3,159.51 at the 3 p.m. close, the highest close since April 15.
The measure rose 5.1 percent last week as the Federal Reserve
unveiled on Nov. 3 plans to buy an extra $600 billion of
Treasuries. The  CSI 300 Index  added 0.8 percent to 3,548.57.  “The quantitative easing by the U.S. is driving
speculative capital into China,” said  Zhou Xi , a Tianjin-based
strategist at Bohai Securities Co. “That has raised the stakes
for regulators who must grapple with inflation and excess
liquidity.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
