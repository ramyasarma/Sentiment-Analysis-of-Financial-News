Radian Group Inc.  fell the most in
three months in New York trading, leading a mortgage-insurer
plunge on concern that an offering of convertible debt will
dilute shareholders.  Radian, the second-largest U.S. mortgage insurer, dropped
$1.13, or 11 percent, to $8.82, at 4:25 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  MGIC Investment Corp.,  the biggest
mortgage insurer, fell 3.9 percent and No. 2  PMI Group Inc. 
declined 5.3 percent.  Radian, based in Philadelphia, will offer as much as $350
million in convertible senior notes due 2017, with underwriters
having the option to buy an additional $52.5 million of the
securities, according to a statement issued today. Mortgage
guarantors have been raising capital to cushion losses from
reimbursing lenders for bad loans.  “If this offering is successful, we believe it will dilute
existing shareholders,”  Rafay Khalid , an equity analyst with
Standard and Poor’s, said today in a statement. Khalid cut the
company to “sell” from “hold.”  Mortgage insurers, which pay lenders after sales of
foreclosed homes fail to recover costs, have suffered losses
over the past three years as  unemployment rates  near the highest
in a quarter century have depressed the housing market.  Morgan Stanley is running the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
