Kenya’s government will lead talks
tomorrow aimed at trying to resolve a dispute between tea
workers and employers over the use of plucking machines, a trade
union official said.  The meeting will involve the ministry of labor, the Kenya
Plantation and Agricultural Workers’ Union, the Kenya Tea
Growers Association,  Unilever NV’s  Kenyan unit, and Eastern
Produce Kenya Ltd., Issa Wafula, the union’s assistant secretary
general, said in a phone interview today from the capital,
Nairobi.  Tea workers in Kenya, the world’s biggest black tea
exporter, called off a two-week strike over the use of tea-
plucking machines on Nov. 2 after an industrial court ordered
the parties to resume talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
