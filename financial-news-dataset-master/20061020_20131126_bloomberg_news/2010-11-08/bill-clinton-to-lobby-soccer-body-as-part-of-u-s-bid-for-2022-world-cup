Former U.S. President  Bill Clinton 
will make a pitch to soccer’s governing body a day before the
vote on the hosts of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022.  Clinton, honorary chairman of the USA bid committee, will
travel to Zurich to speak with the 24  FIFA  delegates, who’ll
decide on World Cup hosts on Dec. 2.  “I’m pleased to stand on behalf of our nation for
something as important and meaningful to the American people and
citizens throughout the world as the FIFA World Cup,” Clinton
said in a statement.  The U.S. faces competition from Japan, Korea, Qatar and
Australia. It hosted the World Cup once before, in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
