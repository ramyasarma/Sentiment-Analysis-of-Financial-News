Bond yield premiums demanded by
investors to hold Irish and Portuguese debt instead of benchmark
bunds may stabilize, Nomura International Plc said.  “This crisis, fueled by little true news, has entered a
new phase and we expect some shorter-term stability,” a team of
analysts led by  Nick Firoozye  in London wrote in a research
report today. Portugal’s sale of bonds scheduled for Nov. 11 may
go “smoothly” as a result, the analysts wrote.  Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou ’s move to rule out
early elections may also “provide some comfort to spreads,”
the analysts wrote in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
