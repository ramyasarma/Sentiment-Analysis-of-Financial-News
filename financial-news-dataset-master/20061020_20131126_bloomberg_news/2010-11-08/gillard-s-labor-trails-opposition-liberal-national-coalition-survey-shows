Australia’s opposition Liberal-
National coalition retained its lead over Prime Minister Julia
Gillard’s Labor Party amid rising voter dissatisfaction with her
performance as leader, according to an opinion survey.  The coalition’s 4-percentage-point lead over Gillard’s
ruling Labor Party, at 52-48 percent on a two-party measure, is
unchanged from a survey two weeks earlier, according to the
Newspoll published in the Australian newspaper today.  Voter dissatisfaction with Gillard rose four points to 41
percent, while those dissatisfied with opposition leader Tony
Abbott fell four points to 42 percent, according to the
telephone survey of 1,141 voters taken on Nov. 5-7.  Labor’s primary vote rose one point to 34 percent, while
the coalition was unchanged at 43 percent, according to the
survey, which had a 3-percentage-point margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
