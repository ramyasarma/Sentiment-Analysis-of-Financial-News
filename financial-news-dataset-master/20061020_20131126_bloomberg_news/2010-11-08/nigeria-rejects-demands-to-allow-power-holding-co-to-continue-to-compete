Nigeria’s Bureau of Public
Enterprises, the body which manages the sale of state assets,
rejected a demand from electricity workers to allow Power
Holding Co. of Nigeria to continue to exist and compete with
private companies once its monopoly is broken.  Allowing such a situation would mean “that consumers will
be compelled to pay for the cost of multiple infrastructure;
whereas one set of infrastructure would have served the populace
at a far-reduced cost,” Bolanle Onagoruwa, the bureau’s
director general, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
