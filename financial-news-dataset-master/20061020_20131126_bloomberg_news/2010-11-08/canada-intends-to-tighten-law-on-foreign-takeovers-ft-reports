The Canadian government plans to
tighten its law on foreign investment, to compel more openness
and accountability, after  Industry  Minister  Tony Clement ’s
rejection of the bid for  Potash Corp.  of Saskatchewan by  BHP
Billiton Ltd. , the Financial Times reported.  Clement told the newspaper the government may compel
foreign investors to make public undertakings on jobs, local
processing, technology transfer, competition and other promises
usually made to meet a “net benefit” test for takeovers under
the Investment Canada Act.  To contact the reporter on this story:
