The euro declined to a one-week low
against the dollar as speculation European nations will struggle
to raise funds reduced demand for the region’s assets.  The common currency weakened versus 14 of its 16 major
counterparts as Portugal prepared to sell as much as 1.25
billion euros ($1.74 billion) of debt tomorrow as concerns about
so-called periphery European nations caused their bonds to
tumble. The pound touched its lowest level in a week after a
U.K. housing-market gauge dropped more than economists forecast
to an 18-month low.  “You’ve got these rumblings over in Europe,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia
in Sydney. “It’s mainly Portugal, Ireland and Greece. There’s a
downside risk for the euro.”  The euro dropped to $1.3882 as of 10:56 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.3920 in New York yesterday, after declining to $1.3847, the
weakest since Oct. 29. The 16-nation currency slid to 112.57 yen
from 113.01, after touching 112.37, the lowest since Nov. 2. The
dollar traded at 81.10 yen from 81.18 yen.  The euro has lost 2.3 percent in the past three days amid
concern debt-stricken nations will struggle to repay bondholders
and spending cuts will stifle growth in the region.  The spread on the 10-year bonds of Portugal over German
debt increased to as much as 444 basis points yesterday, the
most since at least 1997, while the  difference in yield  for
Irish bonds increased to a record 550 basis points.  The Irish government laid out a plan last week to cut
spending and raise taxes by as much as 6 billion euros ($8.4
billion) in 2011. It will detail how it aims to reduce the 6
billion euros on Dec. 7.  ‘Become Untenable’  “Over the past few weeks, it has become clear that both
the political and financial situation in Ireland has become
untenable,” analysts led by Mansoor Mohi-uddin, Singapore-based
chief currency strategist at UBS AG, wrote in a research note
yesterday. “We view euro-franc as the best vehicle to express
the view that problems in the euro-zone periphery are once again
heating up.”  Switzerland’s currency advanced to 1.3417 per euro from
1.3448 yesterday. It reached 1.3407, matching the highest since
Oct. 21. The franc has risen 1.2 percent in the past week among
10 developed-nation currencies, Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes show. The euro has dropped 1.5 percent,
according to the gauges.  U.K. Housing Data  The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said today the
number of real-estate agents and surveyors saying prices fell
exceeded those reporting gains by 49 percentage points, compared
with minus 36 points in September.  “Sterling is at risk from the anticipated deterioration in
the U.K. data over the coming week,” analysts led by Hans-
Guenter Redeker, London-based global head of currency strategy
at BNP Paribas SA, wrote in a note yesterday.  Economists had forecast a decline to minus 39 points,
according to the median of 20 predictions in a Bloomberg News
survey. While the Bank of England kept its  benchmark interest
rate at a record low of 0.5 percent last week, banks are still
rationing credit, RICS said.  The pound fell to $1.6068, the lowest since Nov. 3, before
trading little changed at $1.6143  To contact the reporter on this story:
