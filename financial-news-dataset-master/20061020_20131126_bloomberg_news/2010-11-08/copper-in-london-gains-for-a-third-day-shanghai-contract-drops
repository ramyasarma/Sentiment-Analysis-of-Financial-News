Copper in London climbed for a third
day toward a 28-month high after U.S. employment data signaled
that the recovery is intact and the Federal Reserve eased
monetary policy, boosting demand for commodities.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose as
much as 0.9 percent to $8,735 a metric ton, and was at $8,681.75
a ton at 3:44 p.m. in Singapore. Copper advanced to $8,769.50 a
ton on Nov. 5, the highest price since July 2008, when the metal
reached a record $8,940. December-delivery copper on the Comex
in New York gained as much as 0.8 percent to $3.9815 a pound.  “Copper in London and New York are still going up because
of investment demand from all the liquidity that’s out there,
thanks to the Federal Reserve’s move last week,” Gao Jingsong,
an analyst at Hoohy Futures Co., said from Guangdong.  The U.S. central bank said Nov. 3 it will expand stimulus
by buying $600 billion of Treasuries to sustain growth in the
world’s largest economy. Employment in the U.S. rose in October
by 151,000 jobs, the first gain in five months and a climb that
beat all estimates for the Nov. 5 release in a Bloomberg survey.  Copper fell for the first day in four in Shanghai as high
prices deterred purchases in China, the world’s largest consumer.
February-delivery contracts on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell as much as 1.9 percent to 66,090 yuan ($9,909) a ton, and
ended the day 1.2 percent lower at 66,590 yuan.  “Shanghai is unwillingly trying to keep up,” said Gao.
“Demand destruction is taking place in China, seen from rising
stockpiles and a widening contango,” said Gao, referring to a
situation in which future prices are higher than current costs.  Dollar Strength  Earlier, copper in London fell as much as 0.2 percent as
the  dollar  advanced for a second day against a six-currency
basket. The euro also dropped for a second day against the
dollar before an inspection of Ireland’s budget plan and the
final results of Greece’s local elections.  “The performance of the dollar will remain the main
driving force for prices which are now far removed from their
fundamentals,” Ye Chunyan, an analyst at Jinchang Futures Co.,
said from Shanghai. “We’ll continue to see slower gains in
Shanghai compared to London and New York as physical demand in
China starts to deteriorate.”  Spot copper in Changjiang, Shanghai’s biggest cash market,
traded at a 1,865-yuan-a-ton discount to futures on Nov. 5, the
most since April. Copper stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange stood at 106,851 tons last week, the highest
level in two months.  State Sales  China sold almost all of the 96,000 tons of aluminum ingots
that it offered from the state reserve through public auctions
on Nov. 1 and Nov. 2, according to a statement on the website of
the National Development and Reform Commission today.  A total of 95,767 tons was sold at an average price of
15,343 yuan ($2,302) a ton, said the State Bureau of Material
Reserve, also known as the State Reserve Bureau, which comes
under the commission. The government will also sell 50,000 tons
of zinc ingots from state reserves at an auction tomorrow, the
commission said on Nov. 3.  In Chile, workers at the Collahuasi copper mine, the
world’s fourth-largest, remained on strike for a third day
yesterday after wage talks failed. The mine, owned by Anglo
American Plc and Xstrata Plc, is operating “normally,” a
spokeswoman said yesterday. The dispute may reduce production,
which accounts for 3.3 percent of global output, if it lasts
more than a week, according to Morgan Stanley.  Aluminum in London fell 0.3 percent to $2,445 a ton, zinc
dropped 0.3 percent to $2,519.50 a ton, and nickel declined 0.4
percent to $24,350 a ton. Tin decreased 0.2 percent to $26,400 a
ton, while lead climbed 0.4 percent to $2,515 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
