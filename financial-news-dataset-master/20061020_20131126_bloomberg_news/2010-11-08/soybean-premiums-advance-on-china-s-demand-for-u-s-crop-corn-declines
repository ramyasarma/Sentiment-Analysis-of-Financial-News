Cash premiums for soybeans shipped to
export terminals near New Orleans this month rose on Chinese
demand for U.S. supplies. Corn bids fell on reduced export
shipments.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
November rose to 46 cents to 47 cents a bushel above January
futures, from 40 cents to 48 cents on Nov. 5, government  data 
show.  Corn  premiums fell to 49 cents to 52 cents above December
futures from 49 cents to 53 cents on Nov. 5.  “Chinese demand continues to be robust and should stay
strong for the next four or five weeks,” said  Roy Huckabay , an
executive vice president for the Linn Group in Chicago. “The
soybean-export program has slowed corn shipments.”  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 9.25 cents, or
0.7 percent, to close at $12.7475 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Corn futures for December delivery fell 2.5 cents, or
0.4 percent, to close at $5.8525 a bushel. Corn has jumped 60
percent since the end of June as adverse weather reduced U.S.
production.  In the week ended Nov. 4,  soybeans inspected  for export
fell 22 percent from the week-earlier total, which was revised
up to 73.182 million from 60.260 million, USDA data show. The
revision reflected an increase in the amount sent to China, the
biggest consumer, which took 85 percent of the total last week.  Exports Gain  U.S. soybean-export shipments since Sept. 1 rose to 384.4
million bushels, up 32 percent compared with the same period a
year earlier, USDA data show.  “Everyone wanted to talk about slowing shipments today,
missing the upward revision from last week,” Huckabay said.
“China soybean shipments will stay strong until South American
supplies begin to become available in February.”  Corn inspected  for export last week fell 17 percent to
24.89 million bushels, compared with 30.003 million a week
earlier, the government said.  “Export demand for corn probably won’t increase for
another four or five weeks,” Huckabay said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
