Michel Houellebecq  won France’s most
prestigious literary prize, the 107-year-old  Prix Goncourt , for
“La Carte et le Territoire,” in which an artist encounters a
famous novelist named Houellebecq and helps a police inspector
solve a vicious crime.  The winner -- who gets a check for a symbolic  10 euros 
($14) and an almost certain boost in sales -- was announced to a
crowd of journalists at Paris restaurant  Drouant . The 10-member
jury, which meets at the establishment once a month, then
retreated inside for its customary gastronomic lunch.  Houellebecq, 52, made his name with “Les Particules
Elementaires” (“The Elementary Particles”) and is best known
for “La Possibilite d’une Ile” (“The Possibility of an
Island”).  In “La Carte et le Territoire,” (“The Map and the
Territory,”  Flammarion ), he describes how artist Jed Martin
falls for a beautiful Russian named Olga, gains success with his
portraits of people from various walks of life -- including
Houellebecq -- and becomes entangled in a police investigation.  The other finalists were Maylis de Kerangal for “Naissance
d’un Pont,” (“Birth of a Bridge,”  Verticales ); Virginie
Despentes for “Apocalypse Bebe” (“Apocalypse Baby,”
 Grasset ); and Mathias Enard for “Parle-Leur de Batailles, de
Rois et d’Elephants” (“Tell Them of Battles, Kings and
Elephants,”  Actes Sud ).  First awarded in 1903, the Prix Goncourt has  honored
authors  such as  Marcel Proust  (1919),  Andre Malraux  (1933),
Simone de Beauvoir (1954) and  Marguerite Duras  (1984).  To contact the writers on the story:
