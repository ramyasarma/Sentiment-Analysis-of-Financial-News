African Union Chairman  Jean Ping 
welcomed the “serene and peaceful atmosphere” in Guinea’s
second round of voting in the presidential election.  Ping commented in a statement e-mailed by the Addis Ababa-
based African Union today.  Former Prime Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, who received
43.7 percent of votes in the June 27 first round, is competing
against opposition leader  Alpha Conde , who won 18.2 percent. The
vote will pave the way for the transition from military to
civilian rule in the West African nation.  The election is being held almost two years after the army
seized power following the December 2008 death of
President  Lansana Conte . In December 2009, General Sekouba
Konate took control after an aide shot coup leader  Moussa Dadis Camara  in the head. Guinea hasn’t had a democratic transfer of
power since gaining independence from France in 1958.  To contact the reporter on this story:
