South Korea’s unwillingness to allow
its currency to strengthen against the dollar is causing the
euro and the yen to strengthen as the nation’s central bank
diversifies its currency reserves, according to Lloyds Banking
Group Plc.  “Given that Korea is one of the most developed emerging
markets, with gross domestic product per capita close to
Japan’s, their opposition to allowing their currency to
strengthen seems hard to justify, but they have been talking of
imposing more controls on capital inflows,” strategists led by
 Adrian Schmidt  in London wrote in a research report today.  “In the end, a significant revaluation seems inevitable,
but the longer it is resisted the more the dollar is likely to
fall against the majors as the accumulation of reserves leads to
diversification pressures,” they said.  The won weakened 0.5 percent to 1113.22 per dollar as of
9:24 a.m. in London. The euro was 0.9 percent weaker at $1.3908.  To contact the reporter on this story:
