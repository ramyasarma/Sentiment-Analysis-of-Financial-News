U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said China needs to continue to allow its currency to
gain, adding that the world’s second-largest economy is “very
supportive” of the Group of 20 nations’ framework on reducing
global imbalances.  Speaking at an event in New Delhi, Geithner said it’s
“overwhelmingly” in China’s interest to allow its currency to
appreciate. At the same time, he acknowledged that China’s
leaders are split on how to proceed.  “They’re in the midst of a constant debate,” Geithner
said. “The balance between the forces in favor of moving more
quickly and moving more slowly are constantly shifting.”  OECD Says Growth Slows  Industrial output is slowing in China and Brazil, holding
back global growth, the  Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development ’s September leading indicators showed.  The leading indicators “for Brazil and China continue to
point strongly downward, edging below the long-term trend and
implying that the level of industrial production will fall”
further, the Paris-based OECD said in an e-mailed statement.  Diamond Demand  Diamond demand will rise 20 percent annually in India and
China with half of global growth coming from the two nations in
the next few years,  De Beers  said.  “China and India are the driving force, and China is the
most visible incremental-demand driver,”  Stephen Lussier ,
executive director at Johannesburg-based De Beers, said in an
interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. “India has
been the fastest growing jewelry market.”  CO2 Emissions  China’s rising carbon dioxide emissions must return to
today’s level by 2030 if warming since pre-industrial times is
to be kept to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), London
School of Economics professor  Nicholas Stern  said.  China, the biggest emitter, has set itself a target of
cutting greenhouse gases per unit of gross domestic product by
40 percent to 45 percent from 2005 through 2020. That would
still expand its total emissions because of the nation’s
economic growth rate, Stern said in an e-mailed paper.  MARKETS  U.S. stocks fell, dragging benchmark gauges down from two-
year highs, as a five-week rally left the Standard & Poor’s 500
