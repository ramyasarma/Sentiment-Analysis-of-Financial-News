Standard Bank Group Ltd. , South
Africa’s largest lender, may face a court interdict by labor
union Sasbo to block its plan to cut 1,745 jobs.  Sasbo, which represents 15,400 workers at the bank, is
seeking an interdict to block the cuts announced on Oct. 5, the
Johannesburg-based union said today in a statement.  “Sasbo continues to maintain that the bank’s action is
simply an attempt to boost its short-term profits at the expense
of long-serving, loyal employees,” the union said. “We want
the bank to stop this process.”  Standard Bank, which reported a 15 percent gain in first-
half profit, is cutting jobs in Johannesburg and London as the
slow pace of economic recovery in South Africa checks revenue
growth. The bank could restrict executive pay increases and
bonus payments to curb cost increases, the labor union said.  The lender will study the court papers and respond in due
course, said Standard Bank spokesman  Erik Larsen .  The job cuts in South Africa include 65 executives, 670
managers, 410 general staff, and 600 contract jobs.  “This exercise is not about saving the bank,” Eugene
Ebersohn, assistant general secretary at Sasbo, said in the
statement. “Retrenchments should be the very last resort.”  Standard Bank rose 0.3 percent to 105.25 rand in
Johannesburg trading. The stock has climbed 3.2 percent this
year compared with the 9.7 percent gain in the five-member
 FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
