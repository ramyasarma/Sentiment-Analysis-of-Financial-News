Brait SA may exit its investment in
South African retailer Pepkor Ltd., which accounts for 39
percent of the buyout company’s equity portfolio, Fin24 said,
citing BOE Private Clients analyst Peter Wille.  Pepkor, which has retail stores in 10 countries under the
Pep, Ackermans and Best & Less brands, was delisted from
Johannesburg’s stock exchange in a 2 billion rand transaction in
2003, the Johannesburg-based news website said. Brait may relist
Pepkor’s stock on the bourse, it cited Wille as saying in a
note.        Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
