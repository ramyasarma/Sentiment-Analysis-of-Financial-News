Lumena Resources Corp.  rose to its
highest level in almost a year in Hong Kong trading after the
second-largest producer of thenardite agreed to buy a resin
maker for HK$11.05 billion ($1.43 billion).  Lumena rallied as much as 9.2 percent to HK$3.20, the
highest since December last year, and traded at HK$3.04 as of
12:29 p.m. local time.  The company, which operates mines in China’s Sichuan
province, said yesterday it entered into an agreement to buy as
much as 95 percent of Sino Polymer New Materials Co. using
shares and cash.  “We believe the acquisition target is a good business
because of its leading global market position,” Chi Man Wong,
an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos, wrote in a research note today.
“As the transaction may cause a 19 percent dilution on the 2010
earnings per share, we don’t rule out the possibility that some
investors may ask for a lower valuation.”  The acquisition will help Lumena expand into resins used
in emissions reduction and the automotive industry, adding to
the thenardite it makes that’s used in detergents and medical
products. Thenardite can also be used to make the resins that
Sino Polymer produces.  The purchase price for Sino Polymer, which operates two
plants in Chengdu and Deyang in Sichuan, is 11.2 times the
annualized unaudited net income for the six months ended June 30,
Lumena said yesterday in a  statement .  Lumena  will pay for 90 percent of the purchase by issuing
new shares at HK$3.15, a premium of 7.5 percent to its closing
share price on Oct. 15, the last day before trading was
suspended. The rest will be paid by cash, it said.  Sino Polymer had an operating profit of 761.3 million yuan
($114 million) last year, according to the statement. Lumena
reported a net profit of 533 million yuan for the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
