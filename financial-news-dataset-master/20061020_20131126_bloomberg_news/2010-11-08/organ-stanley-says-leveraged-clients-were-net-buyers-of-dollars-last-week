Morgan Stanley’s leveraged clients
were net buyers of dollars last week, while non-leveraged
traders sold the currency, the bank said.  On an aggregated basis, the dollar was sold for a sixth
straight week and for the 20th week in the last 22, London-based
research analysts  Tim Davis  and Calvin Tse wrote in a research
report today.  The dollar was 0.9 percent stronger at $1.3911 per euro as
of 12:08 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
