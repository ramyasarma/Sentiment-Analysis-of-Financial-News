The U.S. needs national standards for
mortgages and mortgage underwriting, said  Robert P. Kelly , chief
executive officer of  Bank of New York Mellon Corp .  “If we don’t I think we’re just going to create the next
bubble in housing 10 years from now,” Kelly said today at a
 Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  conference
in New York.  The country would benefit from tighter standards around
documentation, appraisals, down payments and broker
qualifications, Kelly, 56, said. He also suggested a system
where banks would hold on to half of the mortgages they make,
with the other half sold through securitization.  Kelly, head of the world’s largest custody bank, discussed
financial regulation, housing, job creation, taxes and the
economy with  Charlie Rose , executive editor and host of
“Charlie Rose,” which airs on PBS and Bloomberg Television.  Americans should consider their homes a place to live
rather than “an asset where you make bets on the value of
housing,” Kelly said.  BNY Mellon has $24.4 trillion in assets under custody and
administration, and the New York-based bank invests $1.14
trillion for clients. Custody banks earn fees for keeping
records, tracking performance and lending securities to
institutional investors such as mutual funds, pensions and hedge
funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
