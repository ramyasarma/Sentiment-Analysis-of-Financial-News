Canadian poker professional Jonathan
Duhamel holds a 6-1 advantage in chips as he faces John Racener
of the U.S. for the $8.9 million top prize at the  World Series
of Poker  in Las Vegas.  Duhamel, 23, and Racener, 24, square off tonight after
outlasting 7,317 other players in the No-Limit  Texas Hold’Em 
world championship. It’s the World Series of Poker’s richest
event, with the top eight finishers at the Rio All-Suite Hotel
and Casino receiving at least $1 million.  Duhamel, of Boucherville, Quebec, majored in finance before
dropping out of the University of Quebec in Montreal. He’s been
playing poker full-time for about two years -- mostly online --
and his combined WSOP earnings before this event were $43,000.  Duhamel has almost 189 million chips to about 30.8 million
for Racener, a poker professional from Port Richey, Florida.
Racener entered this event with $701,165 in earnings from WSOP
tournaments.  The $10,000 buy-in tournament began in July and is the
biggest of more than 50 events on a circuit founded in the
1970s. Nine players advanced to the final table, with seven
being eliminated during a 13-hour session that was completed
early yesterday morning in Las Vegas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
