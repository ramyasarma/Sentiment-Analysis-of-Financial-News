Soitec  rose the most in almost a year
in Paris trading after a trade publication reported that  Intel
Corp.  may opt for a manufacturing process that uses the French
company’s technology.  Soitec rose as much as 15 percent to 8.37 euros, the
biggest intraday gain since Nov. 16, 2009, and traded up 14
percent to 8.27 euros as of 12:38 p.m. Paris time.  EETimes, an electrical engineering publication, last week
reported that Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, may begin
using the silicon-on-insulator technology, citing Piper Jaffray
analyst  Gus Richard .  Such a switch “could really change the size of Soitec,”
 Stephane Houri , a Natixis Securities analyst in Paris, said by
phone. There’s no other information to suggest Intel is making a
switch, he said.  Camille Darnaud-Dufour , a spokeswoman for Soitec, did not
immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
