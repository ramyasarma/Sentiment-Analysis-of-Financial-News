CSR Corp. , a Beijing-based railcar
maker, fell the most in more than 14 months in Hong Kong trading
after the Financial Times reported that China was reviewing
plans to expand its high-speed rail network.  The shares  dropped  6.6 percent, the biggest decline since
Aug. 17, 2009, to HK$9.02 at the 4 p.m. close in Hong Kong.  China’s Ministry of Railways is reviewing high-speed rail
proposals after a report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences to
the State Council raised questions about their practicality and
affordability, the Financial Times said, citing unidentified
people familiar with the matter. China’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  has
seen the report and asked for further talks on the project,
according to the report.  The rail ministry declined to comment by phone today.  China, the world’s fastest-growing major economy, said in
July it needed about 800 billion yuan ($120 billion) to complete
high-speed rail projects as the country invests in train
services to pare pollution and travel times.  The country plans to increase high-speed railroads to
13,000 kilometers (8,000 miles) by the end of 2012 and to 18,000
kilometers by 2020 from the current 3,676 kilometers, according
to Citigroup Inc. analyst  Zhen Ni .  A 1,318-kilometer rapid railroad linking Beijing and
Shanghai, due to open in 2012, will cut journey times to about
four hours from 10 hours, according to the rail ministry.  -- Ying Tian  in Beijing. Editors:  Dave McCombs ,  Terje Langeland .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
