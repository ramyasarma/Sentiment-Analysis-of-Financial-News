Drake & Scull International PJSC , a
Dubai-based engineering contractor for the real-estate industry,
said third-quarter profit fell 44 percent on rising costs.  Net income dropped to 34 million dirhams ($9.3 million), or
0.016 dirham a share, from 60.8 million dirhams, or 0.028 dirham
a share in the same period a year ago, the contractor said in a
statement to the Dubai bourse today.  Drake & Scull’s financial  costs  in the third quarter rose
to 13.8 million dirhams compared with 2.33 million dirhams a
year earlier, the statement said. Contract costs increased to
3.76 billion dirhams from 3.1 billion dirhams.  The deepest global financial crisis since the 1930s led
Dubai property prices to drop by more than 50 percent from their
2008 peak and forced builders to cancel half of the projects in
the emirate. Home prices declined 6 percent in the third quarter
amid increasing supply and lower demand, property broker
Colliers International said in a report yesterday.  “Delay in execution of newly awarded projects affected our
profit stream, especially when our overheads and preconstruction
expenses are continually incurred,” Chief Financial Officer
 Osama Hamdan  said in the statement.  Drake & Scull’s backlog stands at 4.7 billion dirhams and
Chief Executive Officer  Khaldoun Tabari  expects the company to
add 1 billion dirhams worth of new projects by the end of the
year, largely in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, the statement said.  Drake & Scully holds a 65 percent stake in Drake & Scull
International Saudi WLL. The Saudi company has a backlog of 815
million riyals ($217.3 million) and is expected to increase
Drake & Scull’s business in the Middle East and in North Africa,
the company said. This year, the contractor set up offices in
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Syria.  The shares fell 2.7 percent, the biggest intraday drop
since Oct. 12, to 96.3 fils at 10:56 in Dubai trading. They have
gained 7 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
