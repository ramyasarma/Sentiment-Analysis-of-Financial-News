U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said her agency is examining
whether computer algorithms used to trade thousands of shares in
milliseconds should include risk controls that instruct them to
slow down during periods of market volatility.  The agency is considering what to do about algorithms that
“go crazy,” Schapiro said today at a Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association conference in New York. “Should
they be programmed with throttles to slow them down?”  The SEC is stepping up scrutiny of high-frequency trading
and the structure of U.S. markets after a May 6  crash  that
temporarily erased $862 billion from the value of stocks in less
than 20 minutes. The agency is laying out a “road map” of
rules it might consider to confront markets increasingly
dominated by computers, with transactions fragmented across more
than three dozen trading platforms, Schapiro said.  Schapiro said the agency has become increasingly concerned
about trading that lacks human intervention. Staff members
earlier this year examined a situation in which an algorithm
tried to execute 10 percent of a stock’s daily trading in two
seconds, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
