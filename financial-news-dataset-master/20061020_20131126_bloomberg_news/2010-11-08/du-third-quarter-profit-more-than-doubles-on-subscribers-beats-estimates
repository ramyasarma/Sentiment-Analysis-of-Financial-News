Emirates Integrated
Telecommunications Co. , the United Arab Emirates’ second-biggest
phone company, said third-quarter profit more than doubled,
beating estimates, as its client base grew.  Net income climbed to 163.1 million dirhams ($44 million)
from 78.55 million dirhams a year earlier, the company known as
Du said in a statement to the Dubai bourse today. The median
estimate of six analysts was for a profit of 139.5 million
dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue
increased 31 percent to 1.7 billion dirhams.  “By the end of August we had an estimated 37 percent
market share of active mobile subscribers and expect this to
have increased further by the end of the quarter, which is an
outstanding achievement in just three years,” Chief Executive
Officer  Osman Sultan  said in the statement. “We will continue
to lead the way for fixed and mobile broadband services.”  Du, which competes with  Emirates Telecommunications Corp. ,
added 159,800 mobile phone users in the quarter, bringing its
total subscribers to 4.08 million, according to the statement.
Fixed-line subscribers grew 44 percent to 515,400 from the year-
earlier period.  The Dubai-based phone company last month said it obtained
$255 million in financing from the Export-Import Bank of China
as it seeks to repay debts and upgrade its network. The loan
will be used to pay back a short-term facility of $85 million
and purchase equipment to expand its 3G network.  Capital Spending  Capital expenditure for 2010 will reach 1.8 billion
dirhams, according to today’s statement. Du plans to spend at
least 2.2 billion dirhams this year and about the same amount in
2011, Sultan said May 11. Most of the investment will go into
the mobile network to provide faster services, such as music
downloads and Internet connections.  The company said on June 22 that it had sold 1 billion
dirhams of new stock to current investors to fund expansion. Du
in September obtained a $207 million export credit facility
backed by German ECA Euler Hermes to help roll out 2G and 3G
networks.  Du will start offering services through a network-sharing
arrangement with Emirates Telecommunications, known also as
Etisalat, in the first half of 2011 after a delay, Sultan said
last month.  Du shares gained 0.3 percent to 3.03 dirhams at the 2:00
p.m. close in Dubai, giving the company a market value of 13.9
billion dirhams. The stock has gained 8.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
