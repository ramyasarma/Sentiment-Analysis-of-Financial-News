Europe’s high-deficit nations are at
risk again as Germany’s proposed crisis mechanism pushes
borrowing costs higher, according to  Jan Randolph , the head of
sovereign risk at IHS Global Insight, an economic forecaster.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  last month proposed a two-
step mechanism to make bondholders pay for any future euro-area
crisis. Her message clashes with European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet , who says such talk risks exacerbating the
situation for indebted euro-area nations such as Ireland and
Greece as they try to narrow their budget gaps.  “We are now entering another potentially dangerous round,
mainly driven more by the new debt mechanism than the stability
of governments,” Randolph, who is based in London, told  Scarlet Fu  on Bloomberg Television’s “InBusiness” program. “Germany
doesn’t want to have a situation where investors are playing
moral hazard with taxpayers. Trichet said this is going to raise
borrowing costs, and that’s what we are seeing.”  Irish bonds tumbled for a 10th consecutive day today and
the extra  yield  investors demand to hold the debt instead of
benchmark German bunds reached a record high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
