Bank Handlowy SA , the Polish unit of
 Citigroup Inc. , said third-quarter profit fell 26 percent after
it didn’t repeat a gain from a tax refund.  Net income dropped to 210.6 million zloty ($75 million)
from 285.3 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank
said in a statement today. That beat the 187.3 million-zloty
 mean estimate  of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Earnings in the year-earlier quarter were boosted by a gain
of 115 million zloty from a tax refund. Excluding that, profit
would have increased 9 percent, the company said.  Net interest income, the difference between what the bank
pays on deposits and what it charges for loans, was little
changed at 378.9 million zloty, while fees and commissions rose
8 percent.  Total costs climbed 5.5 percent on increased personnel and
marketing expenses, while bad-loan provisions rose 14 percent to
63.3 million zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
