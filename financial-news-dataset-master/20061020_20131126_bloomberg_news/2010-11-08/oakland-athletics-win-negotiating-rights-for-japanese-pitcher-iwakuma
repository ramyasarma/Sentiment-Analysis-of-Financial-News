(Corrects spelling of Iwakuma in final paragraph.)  The Oakland Athletics won the
negotiating rights for Japanese pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma, a
member of the All-Tournament Team at the 2009 World Baseball
Classic.  The Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of Japan’s Pacific League
accepted the highest bid for Hisashi, a 29-year-old right-
hander, Major League Baseball said in a news release. Terms of
the bid weren’t disclosed.  The Athletics have 30 days to sign Iwakuma to a major- or
minor-league contract.  Iwakuma has won 44 games over the past three seasons for
the Golden Eagles, posting a 2.82 earned run average this year,
a 3.25 ERA in 2009 and a 1.87 ERA in 2008, when he went 21-4.  Iwakuma was 1-1 with a 1.35 ERA in three starts and a
relief appearance as Japan won the  World Baseball Classic  last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
