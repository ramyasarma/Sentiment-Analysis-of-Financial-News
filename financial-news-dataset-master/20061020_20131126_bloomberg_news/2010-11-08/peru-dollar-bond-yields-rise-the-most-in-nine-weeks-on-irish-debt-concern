Peru’s dollar bonds fell, pushing
yields to their biggest rise in nine weeks, as concern that
Ireland will struggle to plug its budget deficit and repay debt
reduced the appeal of Latin American assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 151 at 11:29 a.m. New York time, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the biggest increase since Sept.
7, when yields also rose 15 basis points.  Credit-default swaps on Ireland and its banks surged to
record high levels on fears the cost of bailing out the nation’s
financial system is unsustainable. Concern other governments may
struggle to repay debt pushed up Peruvian dollar bond yields,
which fell to their lowest for almost three years on Nov. 1,
before the Federal Reserve announced plans to pump more money
into the world’s largest economy.  “As the U.S. smoke has dissipated, we’re now coming back
to reality,” said  Enrique Alvarez , Head of Latin America fixed-
income research at IDEAglobal in New York. “We’ve been seeing
more and more reticence by the market to accepting Irish debt in
particular. Ireland continues to be a very, very fragile state
of affairs as far as financing. That, to an extent, is what’s
pressing along all the sovereign credits in Latin America.”  The Peruvian sol fell 0.1 percent to 2.7955 per U.S.
dollar, from 2.7925 on Nov. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
