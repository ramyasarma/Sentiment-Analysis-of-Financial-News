(Corrects the date when the merger might take place
to 2012 in the first paragraph.)  Latecoere SA is planning a merger
with industrial partners that would take place in 2012, French
weekly newsletter La Lettre de L’Expansion reported, without
citing anyone.  The plan, to be presented to banks in the first quarter of
2011, may involve Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., the
newsletter added.  Latecoere will break even in 2010 at the net income level,
La Lettre said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
