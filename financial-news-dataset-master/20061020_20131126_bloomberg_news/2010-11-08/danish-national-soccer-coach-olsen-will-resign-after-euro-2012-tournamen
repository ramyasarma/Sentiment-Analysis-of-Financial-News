Morten Olsen  will resign as Denmark’s
national soccer coach when his contract expires after Euro 2012,
by which time he’ll have become the country’s longest-serving
manager.  “Morten Olsen has said he will leave us once the
tournament is over,” Lars Berendt, a Broendby, Denmark-based
spokesman for the Danish Football Association, said today by
telephone.  Denmark is currently third behind Norway and Portugal in
its five-nation qualifying group for the European Championship
in Poland and Ukraine in June 2012. It won the tournament in
1992.  Former Ajax coach Olsen, 61, has guided the Danish team
since 2000, winning 59 games, drawing 30 and losing 25. He’s set
to  surpass  Sepp Piontek, who was in charge between 1979 and
1990, as the longest-serving coach next year.  Olsen was the first player to make 100 appearances for
Denmark, earning 102 caps between 1970 and 1989. He captained
the nation at the 1986 World Cup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
