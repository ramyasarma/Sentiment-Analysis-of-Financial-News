South Africa’s Department of Trade &
Industry started a program that will make available 5.6 billion
rand ($815 million) in tax incentives to boost manufacturing
industries and create jobs.  “The allowance is geared towards providing investment
support in new manufacturing assets and training to employees
involved in such projects,” the Pretoria-based ministry said in
an e-mailed statement today. “It will target new projects as
well as expansions or upgrades of existing projects in the
manufacturing sector.”  Manufacturing industries to benefit from 900 million rand
in incentives are metals and metals fabrication, chemicals and
plastics, and agricultural and new “green” industries, as they
have the highest potential, the ministry said.  The allowances are in line with Trade Minister  Rob Davies ’
calls to help manufacturing add value to South African products
and reduce the nation’s 25.3 percent unemployment rate. The
policy will favor companies that improve production equipment
and upgrade workers’ skills, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
