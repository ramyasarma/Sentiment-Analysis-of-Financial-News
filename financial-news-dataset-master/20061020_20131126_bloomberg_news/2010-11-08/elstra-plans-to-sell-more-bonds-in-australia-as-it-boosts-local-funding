Telstra Corp. , Australia’s largest
phone company, is adding to a line of bonds due in 2020 as it
seeks to obtain more of its funding from the local debt market.  Telstra, based in Melbourne, is marketing at least A$100
million ($101 million) of notes, according to an e-mailed
statement from Westpac Banking Corp., which is helping manage
the sale. The bonds may be priced to yield about 175 basis
points more than the swap rate, according to the statement.  The phone company’s sale of A$150 million of 2020 notes in
June was its first domestic debt issue since 2006, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Telstra, which has bonds  denominated 
in eight currencies outstanding, told investors in September
that it may seek to increase the proportion of its debt funding
sourced in Australian dollars to as much as 40 percent from
about 20 percent.  “The offering is an indication of Telstra’s interest in
making more extensive use of the Australian corporate bond
market in its financing arrangements,” according to today’s
statement.  Telstra priced its June sale of 2020 notes to yield 200
basis points more than the swap rate. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
