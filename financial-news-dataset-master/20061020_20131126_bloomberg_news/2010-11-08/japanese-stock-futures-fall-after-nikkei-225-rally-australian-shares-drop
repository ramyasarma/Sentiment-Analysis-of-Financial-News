Most  Asian stocks  fell on renewed
concern about Europe’s sovereign debt problems and as the
stronger yen versus the dollar and the euro dragged Japanese
stocks lower.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. , which counts Europe as its largest
market, fell 1.5 percent in Hong Kong. Toyota Motor Corp., which
receives about 30 percent of its sales from North America, lost
0.4 percent in Tokyo. BHP Billiton Ltd., the No. 1 mining
company and Australia’s largest oil producer, lost 1.2 percent
today after its steepest weekly gain in two years last week. KT
Corp., South Korea’s biggest phone company, increased 3.4
percent after reporting profit that exceeded estimates, leading
technology and telecommunications companies higher.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  was little changed at 135.25 as
of 7:48 p.m. in Tokyo, with about five stocks falling for every
three that advanced. The measure rose 4.6 percent in the six
days through yesterday, when it closed at its highest level
since July 2008.  “Markets are in a bit of a consolidation mode after a lot
of news to digest and react to last week.” said  Tim Schroeders ,
who helps manage about $1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
Melbourne. “We’re in a bit of a holding pattern given some
potentially negative news out of Europe and, here, the Woodside
deal to contend with.”  The Asia Pacific Index climbed 4.2 percent last week, the
biggest  weekly advance  since December, after the U.S. Federal
Reserve expanded record measures to boost the world’s largest
economy.  Concerns About Ireland  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 0.4 percent and
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index closed 0.8 percent lower. South
Korea’s Kospi Index climbed 0.3 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
index declined 1 percent and China’s Shanghai Composite Index
fell 0.8 percent.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.1
percent today. The index slid 0.3 percent yesterday, as a five-
week rally left the gauge at the highest valuation since May and
concerns over Irish debt curbed demand for riskier assets. U.S.
stocks rallied last week as the Federal Reserve announced a $600
billion bond-purchase plan, employment increased more than
forecast and midterm elections produced a divided Congress.  In Hong Kong, Esprit lost 1.5 percent to HK$43.40. Standard
Chartered Plc, the London-based bank, fell 0.7 percent to
HK$242.20.  Canon Inc. , which receives 32 percent of its revenue
from Europe, slipped 1.3 percent to 3,875 yen in Tokyo.  EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  is
in Ireland today to examine the country’s budget after the Irish
government laid out a plan last week to cut spending and raise
taxes by as much as 6 billion euros ($8.3 billion) in 2011.  ‘Poster Child’  “There are still some sovereign debt issues unresolved,
and Ireland is the poster child for that,” said Art Hogan,
chief market analyst at New York-based Jefferies Group Inc.  Toyota , which counts North America as its biggest market
outside of Japan, lost 0.4 percent to 2,986 yen. Panasonic Corp.,
which gets nearly half its revenue abroad, fell 1.8 percent to
1,191 yen.  Sharp Corp. , Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, slid 2.2 percent to 788 yen.  The yen appreciated to as high as 111.74 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 113.34 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 80.80 from 81.24. A stronger yen cuts overseas
income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Energy and material companies are the two industries that
have risen the most in both the past week and the past month
among the MSCI index’s 10 groups.  Commodity Shares Drop  BHP dropped 1.2 percent to A$44.64, the  biggest-drag  on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Posco, the world’s No. 3 steelmaker,
lost 1.1 percent to 475,000 won in Seoul. Inpex Corp., Japan’s
largest oil explorer, lost 2.2 percent to 431,500 yen in Tokyo.  Crude oil dropped for the first time in seven days,
declining from a two-year high in New York yesterday, after
analysts forecast U.S. crude inventories climbed to the highest
level in 18 months. The December futures contract slipped as
much as 0.7 percent to $86.44 a barrel in electronic trading.
The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial
metals including copper and aluminum slumped 0.4 percent
yesterday.  “Investors will likely sell shares in profit taking,”
said Ryoji Nagaoka, who helps with investment information at
Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd., an Australian gas and oil producer,
lost 6.3 percent to A$42.99 in Sydney, the  second-steepest
decline  on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index of almost 1,000 companies.
Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, said today it
sold 10 percent of Woodside, having announced the plan yesterday
after the close of Sydney trading.  Sino Land  Sino Land Co. tumbled 5.7 percent to HK$17.24, the biggest
decline on the Hang Seng Index. The company will sell 305
million shares at HK$16.85 apiece in a top up placement,
according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.
That’s a 7.8 percent discount from yesterday’s close.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 3.4 percent through
yesterday since the Federal Reserve unveiled on Nov. 3 plans to
buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries to bolster economic
growth. Stocks in the gauge are valued at about 14.7 times
 estimated earnings  on average, compared with about 22.7 times at
the start of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Telephone stocks gained the most among the 10 industry
groups on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index today.  In South Korea, KT Corp. rose 3.4 percent to 46,300 won in
Seoul after saying net income totaled 350.6 billion won ($315
million) in the third quarter, surpassing the 342 billion won
average estimate compiled by Bloomberg from 11 analysts in the
past 28 days.  In Japan, Softbank rose 3.5 percent to 2,804 yen. Japan’s
third-biggest mobile-phone network operator booked 324,200 net
new clients in October, more than five times the number of each
of its two larger rivals, according to figures reported by the
companies and published yesterday afternoon.  To contact the reporters for this story:
