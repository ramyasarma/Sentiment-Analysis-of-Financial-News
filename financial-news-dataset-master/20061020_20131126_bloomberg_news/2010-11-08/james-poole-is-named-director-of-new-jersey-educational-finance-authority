The New Jersey Educational Facilities
Authority, which handles about $1 billion a year in bond issues
for Princeton University and other colleges, named former New
Jersey Public Finance head  James Poole  executive director.  Poole, whose selection was  approved  at a special authority
board meeting in Princeton today, now serves as senior director
for procurement at the Schools Development Authority, the agency
in charge of New Jersey’s court-ordered $12.5 billion overhaul
of public school buildings in Newark, Camden and other poor
cities. He spent eight years as director of the Office of Public
Finance.  Poole replaces  Roger Anderson , who resigned July 23 to
become vice president of finance for Centenary College in
Hackettstown, New Jersey.  “Our clients will be well served by Jim’s vast experience
in the municipal markets and knowledge of credit considerations,
especially with complex financing structures,” Roger Jacobs,
chairman of the authority, said in a statement announcing
Poole’s selection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
