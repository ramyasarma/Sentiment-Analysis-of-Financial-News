Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker operated by  Fiat SpA , has laid the “groundwork for a
successful transformation,” the companies’ chief executive
officer said today.  Sergio Marchionne , CEO of both Chrysler and Fiat, addressed
workers in a message obtained by Bloomberg on the day the U.S.
automaker raised its operating profit forecast for the year and
said its net loss narrowed to $84 million in the third quarter.  “The changes we are bringing about are beginning to enter
into the DNA of the company,” Marchionne said in the message.
“You can tell by how the language and tone of conversations
have changed, by the long hours people are working, and by the
way teams form and function.”  Shawn Morgan , a Chrysler spokeswoman, confirmed the memo
was sent.  “We knew when we began this reconstruction process that
the road back would be a long one,” Marchionne said. “We’ve
hit some key milestone and we’ve made progress in important
areas. We have laid the groundwork for a successful
transformation. I ask you to continue to have faith in your
leadership.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
