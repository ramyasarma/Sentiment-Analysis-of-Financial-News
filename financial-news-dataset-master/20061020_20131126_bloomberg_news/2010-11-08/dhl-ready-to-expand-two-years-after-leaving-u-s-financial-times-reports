Deutsche Post ’s DHL Express is ready
to expand again, two years after pulling out of the U.S., the
Financial Times reported, citing an interview with  Chief Executive Officer   Ken Allen .  While DHL Express closed its domestic business in the U.S.,
it retained 75 percent of its international clients in the
country, Allen said, and the company, which planned to cut its
U.S. losses from 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to 400 million
euros, has “done better than that,” he said, according to the
newspaper.  “We’ve stabilized the business, everyone’s refocused” the
FT cited Allen as saying. “I know it’s early days, but we know
what we need to do to grow,” Allen said, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
