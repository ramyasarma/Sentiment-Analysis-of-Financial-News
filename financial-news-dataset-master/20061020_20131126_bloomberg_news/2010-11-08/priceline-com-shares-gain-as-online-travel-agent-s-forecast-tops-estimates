Priceline.com Inc. , the second-
largest online travel agency, rose the most in more than three
months in Nasdaq trading after forecasting fourth-quarter profit
that exceeded analysts’  estimates .  Profit  this quarter, excluding some items, will be $2.91 to
$3.06 a share, the company said yesterday in a statement.
Analysts had projected earnings of $2.68 a share.  A rebound in travel to Europe and Asia led travelers to use
Priceline to arrange more hotel stays, fueling a 54 percent gain
in booked room nights. An increase in international flight
bookings also boosted the results.  Priceline , based in Norwalk, Connecticut, rose $35.77, or
9.2 percent, to $424.35 at 10:07 a.m. New York time on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. It climbed as high as $425.70, or 9.6
percent, the biggest advance since Aug. 4. The shares had
 climbed  78 percent this year before today.  Third-quarter sales gained 37 percent to $1 billion,
exceeding the $974 million average projection in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts. Profit excluding some costs was $5.33 a
share, topping the $4.97  predicted  by analysts.  Net income fell 30 percent to $223 million, or $4.41 a
share, from $319 million, or $6.42, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
