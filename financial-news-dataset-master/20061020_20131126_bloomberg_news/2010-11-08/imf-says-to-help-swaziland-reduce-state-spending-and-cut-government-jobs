The  International Monetary Fund  will
help Swaziland implement a government program to reduce the size
of its civil service and cut spending, Joannes Mongardini of the
IMF’s Africa department, said.  The agency will give Swaziland technical support for the
four-year plan and help monitor its implementation, he said in a
speech in the capital, Mbabane, today. It will not yet give the
southern Africa country a loan, Mongardini said.  Swaziland, which borders South Africa and whose 1.2 million
people are ruled by  King Mswati III , released the program last
month to try to avert a budget crisis. It plans to freeze public
servant salaries and cut 7,000 state jobs.  Swaziland’s lower revenue was because of less income from
the Southern African Customs Union due to the decline in trade
during the global economic crisis, Mongardini said.  The SACU shares revenue customs revenue among South Africa,
Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
