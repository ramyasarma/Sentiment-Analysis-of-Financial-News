Australia’s luxury-home auction held
at the Sydney Opera House sold A$4.1 million worth of property,
less than the A$30 million the organizer expected.  Two out of the 11 homes put up for sale were sold. The Ray
White Group, which organized the auction today, expects to sell
an additional three properties in “the next couple of days,”
Chairman Brian White said in an interview after the auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
