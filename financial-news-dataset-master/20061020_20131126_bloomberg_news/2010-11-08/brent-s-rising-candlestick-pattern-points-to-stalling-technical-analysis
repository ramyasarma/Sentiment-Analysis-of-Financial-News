Brent crude’s gains may stall after
last week’s 6 percent price climb resulted in the formation of a
rising “benchmark candlestick,” according to SEB AB.  “Having seen such one-way traffic in one week normally the
market would take a pause for two or three weeks,”  Anders Soederberg , chief technical analyst at SEB, said today by phone
from Stockholm.  Candlestick charts show information on opening and closing
prices and the trend within each trading period. If the closing
price is above the open, the candlestick is clear, indicating a
bullish trend in the attached chart. If the contract closes
lower than it opened, the candlestick is blue, or bearish.  A so-called benchmark candlestick stands out from the
surrounding ones, Soederberg said. Brent last formed that
pattern in the week to Oct. 1 when it rose 6.2 percent to $83.75
a barrel, he said. Front-month Brent averaged $83.54 last month.  The middle of last week’s trading range on the January
Brent contract is $85.84 a barrel. That so-called mid-body point
forms a strong support, according to the second-largest bank in
the Baltic countries. “That is an important reference point
going forward,” Soederberg said.  Brent crude for January delivery fell 33 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $88.01 a barrel on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange as of 12:20 p.m. local time. The front-month December
contract was at $87.77 a barrel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
