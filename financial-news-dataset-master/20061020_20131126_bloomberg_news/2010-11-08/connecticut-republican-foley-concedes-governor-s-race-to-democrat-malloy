Republican  Tom Foley  conceded the
race for  Connecticut  governor to Democrat  Dan Malloy , saying he
wouldn’t challenge Nov. 2 voting irregularities in Bridgeport,
the state’s biggest city.  “The election on Tuesday was a conclusive victory for Dan
Malloy and should not be contested,” Foley, 58, said in
Hartford during a press briefing webcast by  NBCNewYork.com .
“Everybody can be comfortable with the result of the election
and that the next governor was legitimately elected,” he said.  Malloy, 55, won by 5,637 votes, enough to avoid a mandatory
recount, Secretary of State  Susan Bysiewicz   said  last week,
citing unofficial results. Malloy will be the first Democrat to
hold the state’s top office in 20 years, succeeding Republican
 Jodi Rell , 63, who didn’t seek re-election. Foley refused to
concede last week, questioning the vote in Bridgeport.  Because some precincts ran short of printed ballots,
Bysiewicz, a Democrat, asked for a court order to keep polling
places in Bridgeport open for an extra two hours. Some voters
were given photocopied ballots to use. Earlier today, the
state’s Republican Party  sought  federal and state investigations
into how votes were cast and counted in the city.  To contact the reporters on this story:
