Ivory Coast’s  former President  Henri Konan Bedie , who placed third in the Oct. 31 presidential
election, told his supporters to vote for leading opposition
candidate  Alassane Ouattara  in a runoff later this month.  Bedie, who got 25.2 percent of the first-round vote and was
eliminated from the second contest that pits Ouattara against
President  Laurent Gbagbo , asked his supporters to “massively
vote” for the former deputy director of the International
Monetary Fund and ex-prime minister of the West African nation,
according to a statement e-mailed today.  Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa grower, held its first
election in a decade last month. None of the 14 candidates
including the incumbent Gbagbo earned a majority of ballots in
the vote, necessitating the Nov. 21 second round, according to
the Abidjan-based electoral commission.  Bedie and Ouattara agreed before the first round to support
each other, should one of them reach the runoff and face Gbagbo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
