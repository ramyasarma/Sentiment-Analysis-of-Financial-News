Romanian central bank Governor  Mugur Isarescu  said he sees no reason for the country’s currency to be
unstable in 2011 after the “extremely large” current-account
deficit narrowed to between 4 percent and 6 percent of gross
domestic product, private television station  Pro TV  reported.  Isarescu told Pro TV in an interview aired yesterday that
the leu is trading in line with fundamentals and is “relatively
stable,” after the current-account gap, the main reason for the
currency’s instability, narrowed from 12 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
