Brazil has room to raise the
country’s  minimum wage  next year more than the 5.5 percent
increase the government is proposing, said Senator  Gim Argello ,
the lawmaker sponsoring the 2011 budget bill in Congress.  Argello, in an interview, said he will discuss with
President-elect  Dilma Rousseff ’s transition team a proposal by
trade unions to raise the minimum wage to 580 reais ($341) next
year from 510 reais. That’s more than twice the 5.5 percent
increase to 538.15 reais proposed by President  Luiz Inacio Lula 
da Silva, which Rousseff said she supports.  “The government has made some moves that create conditions
for bigger revenue,” said Argello, whose  Brazilian Labor Party 
is a member of the government’s coalition in Congress. “There’s
room for more, that’s why we’re having a meeting.”  Argello, who represents the capital, Brasilia, in the
Senate, said raising the minimum wage to 580 reais instead of
540 reais would cost the government an additional 12 billion
reais.  The president-elect told Band TV on Nov. 1 that she will
continue the government’s policy of annually increasing the
country’s minimum wage based on a formula that combines the
previous year’s inflation, as measured by the INPC index, with
the percentage growth of GDP from two years prior.  Since Latin America’s biggest economy stalled during the
global financial crisis last year, the wage increase for 2011
will be a little above inflation, she said. Lula raised the
minimum wage 9.7 percent this year, to 510 reais, and proposed
an increase of 5.5 percent in 2011 to 538.15 reais.  To contact the reporters on this story:
