New Zealand’s Crown Fibre Holdings,
the government agency responsible for a NZ$1.5 billion national
broadband project, has begun recommending suitable partners to
Communications Minister Steven Joyce, the Dominion Post
reported, citing a person at the agency it didn’t name.  The recommendations follow talks with three companies who
were earlier listed as priority bidders in eight regions, the
newspaper said. Joyce is expected to act on the recommendations
as soon as possible in order to get contracts signed and work
under way, the Post said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
