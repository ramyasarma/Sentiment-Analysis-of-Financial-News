En+ Group Ltd., Russian billionaire
 Oleg Deripaska ’s energy and metals holding company, borrowed
$900 million from  VTB Capital  for two years to refinance debt.  The company is able to extend the loan for a year, En+ said
today in an e-mailed statement. The terms allow En+ to recover
the 25 percent of  OAO EuroSibEnergo  banks hold as collateral and
cut the 15 percent of  United Co. Rusal  held as assurance against
repayment to 11 percent, En+ spokesman  Andrei Petrushinin  said.  EuroSibEnergo is seeking to raise money through a Hong Kong
initial public offering by the year-end that values the company
at $8 billion, after Rusal sold shares in the city in January, a
person familiar with the plans told Bloomberg in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
