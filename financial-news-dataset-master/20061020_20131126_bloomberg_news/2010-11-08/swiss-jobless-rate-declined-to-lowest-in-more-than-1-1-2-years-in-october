The Swiss jobless rate fell to the
lowest in more than 1 1/2 years in October as companies boosted
their workforce to meet global export demand.  The jobless rate dropped to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent in
September when adjusted for seasonal swings, the State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Bern said today in an e-
mailed statement. That’s the lowest since May 2009 and in line
with the median forecast of nine economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. The  unadjusted jobless rate  held at 3.5 percent.  Swiss companies have added workers, in turn encouraging
consumer demand and bolstering an economic recovery. The
government in September raised its growth forecast for 2010 and
 ABB Ltd. , the world’s largest maker of power-transmission gear,
said last month that increased spending by customers on
industrial equipment will support earnings and sales into 2011.  “Unemployment is set to fall further,” said  David Marmet ,
an economist at Zuercher Kantonalbank in Zurich. “Swiss
companies will keep on hiring because the recovery is solid.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
