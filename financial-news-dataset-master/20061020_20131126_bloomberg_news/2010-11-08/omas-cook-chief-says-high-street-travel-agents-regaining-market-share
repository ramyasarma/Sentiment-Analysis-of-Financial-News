Thomas Cook Group Plc  Chief Executive
Officer  Manny Fontenla-Novoa  said traditional travel agents are
regaining market share from Web-based operators in some markets
as consumers become more cautious.  “People are much more cautious about how they spend their
money,” the CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
Consumers are “more confident of making the right decision if
they go to the high street,” he said, referring to agents
operating in city centers.  Thomas Cook Group and the Co-operative Group Ltd. said
Oct. 8 they plan to merge their U.K. travel and foreign-exchange
units in a deal that will create a 1,200-store chain and save
more than 35 million pounds ($56 million) a year. The combined
business will be the U.K.’s largest travel retailer and the
second-biggest provider of retail foreign exchange, the
companies said in a statement.  Travelers are looking for more complete service and better
value, including the type of protection London-based Thomas Cook
provided to clients stranded after the ash from a volcanic
eruption in Iceland grounded European flights in April, the CEO
said. Thomas Cook, which lost 81.9 million pounds from the ash
disruption, paid for accommodation and meals for stranded
clients, he said.  “The flight towards trusted brands is marked and has been
building and building over the past years,” Fontenla-Novoa
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
