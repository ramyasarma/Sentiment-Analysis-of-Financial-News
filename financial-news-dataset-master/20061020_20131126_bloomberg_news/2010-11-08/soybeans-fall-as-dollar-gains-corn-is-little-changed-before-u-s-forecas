Soybean futures declined as the
dollar’s rebound eroded the appeal of some commodities. Corn was
little changed before a U.S. government update tomorrow on
global supply and demand.  The dollar  headed for the biggest two-session gain since
August against a basket of major currencies. On Nov. 5, soybeans
rose to the highest level since September 2008 on mounting
demand from China.  “The strong dollar is the main factor for today’s
weakness,” said Chad Henderson, a market analyst at Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.
“Traders are evening up positions” before the U.S. Department
of Agriculture report tomorrow, he said.  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 4 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $12.80 a bushel at 10:23 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, heading for the first drop in four sessions. On Nov.
5, the price reached $12.90.  Corn futures for March delivery were little changed at
$6.015 a bushel. On Nov. 5, the price reached $6.055, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Aug. 25, 2008.
The commodity surged 17 percent in October after hot, dry
weather reduced the size of the U.S. crop.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest exporter of corn and
soybeans.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
