Japanese  stocks  rose, driving the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average to its highest level in more than three
months, after a government report last week showed the U.S.
added more jobs than forecast, and as commodity prices increased.  Honda Motor Co. , Japan’s second-biggest carmaker that
receives about 42 percent of its revenue from North America,
climbed 3.3 percent as the yen weakened. Komatsu Ltd., the
world’s second-largest maker of mining trucks and excavators,
rose 4.7 percent.  JX Holdings Inc. , Japan’s biggest oil refiner
and copper producer, jumped 6.3 percent after raising its full-
year profit forecast.  Resona Holdings Inc. , Japan’s fourth-
biggest bank, tumbled 8.6 percent, leading declines by lenders.  “The jobs report shows the U.S. economy is heading toward
a mild recovery,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , a fund manager in Tokyo
who helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co.
“Commodity prices have been strong, and they will probably stay
steady for a while.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 1.1 percent to
9,732.92, the highest close since July 28 and its fourth
straight advance. The broader  Topix  index gained 0.8 percent to
841.74, with about three stocks climbing for each one that fell.  The Topix index climbed 3 percent last week, the biggest
weekly gain since the period ended July 9, on optimism the U.S.
Federal Reserve will succeed in stoking growth in the world’s
biggest economy. Stocks in the gauge trade at an average 15
times  estimated earnings , compared with 38.1 times at the start
of the year.  Exporters Gain  Exporters climbed on optimism demand will increase in the
U.S. Honda gained 3.3 percent to 2,975 yen, while  Nissan Motor
Co. , Japan’s third-largest carmaker, advanced 2 percent to 779
yen. Sharp Corp., Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, jumped 2.7 percent to 806 yen. Car and electronics
makers were the biggest contributors to the Topix index’s
advance.  Komatsu jumped 4.7 percent to 2,275 yen and was the most
heavily traded stock by value in Japan.  Fanuc Ltd. , an
industrial robot maker that receives about 12 percent of its
revenue from the Americas, rose 3.1 percent to 12,420 yen. It
was the largest contributor to the Nikkei 225’s gains.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.3 percent
today. The index climbed 0.4 percent on Nov. 5 after U.S. Labor
Department figures showed payrolls climbed by 151,000, exceeding
the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Private payrolls that exclude government agencies also gained
more than forecast, and the jobless rate held at 9.6 percent.  Exporters Climb  “The U.S. economy is recovering faster than market
participants have thought,” said  Akio Yoshino , who helps
oversee the equivalent of $36 billion as chief economist at
Amundi Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. “Expectations for the yen’s
appreciation against the dollar are peeling off, boosting stocks
and prompting investors to sell bonds.”  Exporters also gained as the yen weakened against the
dollar. The yen depreciated to as much as 81.41 to the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 80.81 at the close of stock
trading on Nov. 5. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas
income at Japanese companies when converted into their home
currency.  Commodity producers climbed after oil and metal prices
increased. Mitsui & Co., the country’s No. 2 trading house by
market value, rose 2.5 percent to 1,352 yen, while Sumitomo
Metal Mining Co., Japan’s biggest gold producer, gained 2.3
percent to 1,410 yen. Nippon Light Metal Co., a rolled-aluminum
products maker, surged 7.8 percent to 152 yen.  Commodities Gain  JX Holdings  jumped 6.3 percent to 527 yen after raising its
full-year net income forecast by 19 percent. It was the third-
biggest contributor to the Topix index’s gains after Honda and
Komatsu.  Crude oil for December delivery rose 0.4 percent in New
York on Nov. 5 to $86.85 a barrel, the highest settlement price
since Oct. 8, 2008. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices
for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum gained
0.3 percent, and gold futures surged to a record.  Credit Saison Co. , a Japanese credit-card company, jumped
5.5 percent to 1,238 yen, after boosting its full-year net
income forecast 33 percent.  A measure of banks, led by Resona, fell as much as 1.4
percent today, paring the Topix index’s advance briefly in the
afternoon. The bank index closed 0.5 percent lower.  Regional Lenders Decline  Resona  tumbled 8.6 percent to 468 yen, its lowest close on
record and the  steepest  drop in the Nikkei 225. The lender said
Nov. 5 it plans to sell as much as 600 billion yen of common
stock over the next year, using the proceeds and 300 billion yen
of reserves to buy back preferred stock from the government and
retire the shares.  Regional lenders declined after Nomura Holdings Inc.
lowered its ratings on “buy”-rated regional banks to
“neutral,” except for Fukuoka Financial Group Inc. The
brokerage also reduced their price estimates.  “We have lowered our investment ratings on regional banks,
and we currently see few factors that are likely to push up
share prices,”  Masahiko Sato , an analyst at Nomura, wrote in a
report dated Nov. 5. “We think profit recoveries in the sector
have now run virtually their course.”  Gunma Bank Ltd. declined 2.9 percent to 400 yen, while Bank
of Yokohama Ltd. dropped 2.2 percent to 398 yen.  Hachijuni Bank
Ltd.  slid 2.1 percent to 414 yen, and Suruga Bank Ltd. lost 2.4
percent to 721 yen.  To contact the reporter for this story:
