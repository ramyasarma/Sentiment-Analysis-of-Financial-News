The yen will rally to a new record at
about 72 per dollar next year as the currency’s 40-year rising
trend comes to an end, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities
Co. said, citing trading patterns.  Japan’s currency is in the final stage of an advance that
started when the nation ended the yen’s peg against the dollar
in 1973, said  Naohiko Miyata , chief technical analyst at the
unit of Japan’s largest banking group. The forecast is based on
analysis developed by accountant Ralph Nelson Elliott during the
Great Depression called the Elliott Wave, which says market
swings follow a predictable five-stage structure.  “The yen will record its final surge versus the dollar
around the first half of next year,” Miyata said.  The yen’s upward trend remains intact, even though the
dollar will temporarily rebound early next year toward 89 yen or
85.93 yen, the level reached after Japan intervened in currency
markets on Sept. 15, Miyata said. The dollar slid against the
yen in the first, third and fifth Elliott Waves, and underwent
correction in the second and fourth, he said.  The yen strengthened to 80.22 versus the dollar on Nov. 1,
the highest since April 19, 1995, when the currency reached a
record high of 79.75. The yen traded at 81.19 per dollar as of
1:11 p.m. in Tokyo.  Fifth Wave  The first wave began as Japan ended the yen’s peg following
the so-called Nixon Shock in 1971, when then-U.S. President
Richard Nixon’s administration suspended the gold standard for
the dollar, Miyata said. The initial wave pushed the yen to as
high as 175.5 per dollar in October 1978 before the second wave
weakened the yen to 278.50 in October 1982, he said.  The third wave ended when the yen gained to a record 79.75
in April 1995, according to Miyata. The 12-year fourth wave,
where a “triangle formation” appeared, finished when the yen
hit a low of 124.16 yen in June 2007, he said. A triangle
pattern is formed when upper and lower trend lines intersect.  The ongoing fifth wave will likely end in the second
quarter of 2011, based on the theory that the dollar bottoms out
at an average cycle of about 64 months, Miyata said. The last
stage could also end in October next year, based on the
assumption that it will take 198 months for the fourth and fifth
waves to finish, the same number of months it took for the
second and third waves to complete, according to Miyata.  The dollar dropped about 50 percent during the first wave
and declined from an April 1990 high of 160.35 yen to a record
low of 79.75 yen, Miyata said. The currency may target 75 yen,
which is about 50 percent below the August 1998 high of 147.63
yen or 72 yen, one-fifth of 360 yen, according to Miyata.  “In the past, 180 yen and 120 yen -- submultiples of 360
yen -- were seen as key levels,” Miyata said. The dollar’s
record low of 79.75 yen is an “overshoot” of 90 yen, which is
a quarter of 360 yen, he said.  Yen’s Gradual Slide  After the yen’s 40-year rally ends next year, the currency
will begin a long-term decline against the dollar, Miyata said.
The yen may target 124 per dollar, the level reached when the
triangle pattern was completed in the fourth wave, he said.  Still, since the yen weakened to as low as 147 per dollar
during the triangle formation, “about 150 may come into sight”
around 2015 to 2016, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
