JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its
forecasts for the euro against the dollar, citing the “very low
probability” of default by one of the region’s nations.  The single European currency will end the year at $1.40 and
strengthen to $1.45 by the second quarter next year and $1.48 in
the third quarter,  John Normand , head of global foreign-exchange
strategy, wrote in a research report dated Nov. 5. All forecasts
were previously for $1.30.  “Financing is almost guaranteed for countries that propose
and deliver meaningful fiscal tightening and European Monetary
Union break-up is more unlikely than it was six months ago,”
Normand wrote. “Interim events,” such as the possibility of
failed auctions and slow disbursement of bailout funds, are
likely to be “a constraint on the euro’s rise rather than the
trigger for reversal,” he said.  The euro was 0.6 percent weaker at $1.3954 as of 8:29 a.m.
