The Bank of Japan will buy 150
billion yen ($1.8 billion) in domestic government debt on Nov.
11 through a new fund that aims to stimulate demand and defeat
deflation. The BOJ announced last month that its 5 trillion yen
fund will buy about 3.5 trillion yen in government debt and the
remainder will be used to purchase assets such as commercial
paper, exchange traded funds and real estate investment trusts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
