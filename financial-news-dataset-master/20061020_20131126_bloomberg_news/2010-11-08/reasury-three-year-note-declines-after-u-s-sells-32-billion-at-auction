Treasury notes fell as the government
prepared to sell 10-year notes and 30-year bonds this week,
after a 3-year note sale drew reduced non-primary dealer demand.  Three-year notes declined after the government sold $32
billion of the securities, the first of three offerings this
week of $72 billion in notes and bonds. Treasury 30-year bonds
yields fell from the highest levels since June, as traders
assessed the Federal Reserve’s plan to purchase more debt in a
bid to spark normal levels of inflation and reduce unemployment
that remains near a 26-year high.  “The bigger issue this week is going to be 10s and 30s and
the market is starting to set up for this, which is why we are
seeing a little bit of weakness,” said  Larry Milstein , managing
director in New York at RW Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income
broker and dealer for institutional investors. “Investors
should buy on dips in Treasuries, given the Fed’s buying
stance.”  Yields on the Treasury’s benchmark 10-year notes rose two
basis points to 2.55 percent at 5:07 p.m. in New York, according
to BGCantor Market Data. The 2.675 percent securities due August
2020 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000, to 100 19/32. Thirty-year
bond yields was little changed at 4.12 percent, after touching
4.15 percent, near the highest since June 22.  Note Yields  The  yield  on the current three-year note rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.55 percent. Two-year note
yields rose three basis points to 0.4 percent, the highest since
Oct. 28.  The government will sell $24 billion of 10-year debt
tomorrow and $16 billion of 30-year bonds on Nov. 10.  The three-year securities drew a yield of 0.575 percent at
today’s auction, compared with the 0.577 percent average
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the 18 primary
dealers obligated to participate in government auctions. The
bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids
with the amount of securities offered, was 3.26, compared with
2.95 in the previous auction.  Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks,
bought 35 percent of the securities, less than the 44 percent
average of the past 10 auctions. Direct bidders, non-primary
dealer investors, purchased 13.7 percent of the security, less
than the 13.9 percent they purchased in September. That left
primary dealers with 51.1 percent of the sale, more than the
42.81 percent they purchased during the past 10 sales.  Dealer Holdings  “Dealers were left with a larger-than-recent-average
percentage of the auction, mostly as a result of indirect
bidders,”  Chris Ahrens , head interest-rate strategist at UBS
Securities LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, a primary dealer. “It
was viewed as a tepid auction in terms of how the securities
were allocated, and we have 10s and bonds in a short week next
up.”  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard 
said the impact from the Fed’s decision to buy $600 billion of
Treasuries through June will probably stimulate the economy as
soon as six months from now.  “Easing of monetary policy produces its maximum impact on
real variables in the economy, including output, consumption,
and investment, with a lag of six to 12 months and can be
difficult to disentangle,” the St. Louis Fed said today in a
statement today based on remarks planned by Bullard in New York.  Fed Reinvests  The central bank today acquired $6.26 billion of Treasuries,
buying 15 of the 27 Treasuries listed for possible purchase. The
securities mature from October 2016 to August 2019, the New York
Fed said in a statement today.  The Fed has bought $75.845 billion of Treasuries since it
began the program on Aug. 17. Policy makers are seeking to keep
holdings in the System Open Market Account, or SOMA, at about $2
trillion by using the proceeds of principal payments from its
agency mortgage-backed securities and agency debt.  The Fed’s move will spur economic growth and reduce the
risk of deflation,  Jan Hatzius , the New York-based chief U.S.
economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in an e-mail to
clients.  Because the Fed’s target for overnight loans between banks
is near zero, the central bank is doing “the next best thing,”
according to Goldman, a primary dealer. “Downside risks to the
economic outlook have declined significantly. U.S. inflation is
unlikely to become a problem for years.”  Fund managers in a survey by Ried Thunberg ICAP Inc., a
unit of the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, became less
bearish on the outlook for U.S. bonds through the end of
December.  Ried’s sentiment index rose to 47 for the seven days ended
Nov. 5 from 45 the week before. A figure less than 50 indicates
that investors expect prices to fall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
