German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  has a two-tier plan to make holders of euro-area
government bonds liable for potential losses in a future crisis,
 Der Spiegel  magazine reported, citing an interview.  In the first phase, any euro-region country that is
struggling to avoid insolvency would be forced to apply
austerity measures and bonds maturing in this period would be
extended, Schaeuble is cited as saying.  Should the fiscal steps in the first instance fail to
reduce the risk of insolvency, second-phase measures would apply
in which buyers of new bonds would be forced to accept cuts in
redemptions, Spiegel cited him as saying. Guarantees would kick
in for the remaining value of the bonds, he said.  Schaeuble wants contracts for euro-region bonds “to spell
out in future exactly what will happen to the demands of the
investor in a crisis situation,” he said, according to Spiegel.
The International Monetary Fund should manage the process of
applying the crisis mechanism, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
