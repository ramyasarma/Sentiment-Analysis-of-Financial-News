United Co. Rusal , the world’s largest
aluminum maker, rose to a record in Hong Kong on optimism higher
metal prices may boost its earnings.  Rusal  gained by as much as 8.1 percent to HK$11, the
highest since its Jan. 27 debut, and traded at HK$10.98 as of
11:16 a.m. local time. Aluminum prices in London have gained 26
percent since the end of 2008, touching a six-month high of
$2,459 a ton on Oct. 14.  The Federal Reserve said on Nov. 3 it will buy an extra
$600 billion of Treasuries to accelerate economic growth, cut
unemployment and avert deflation. Metal prices in London surged
as the decision boosted the outlook for demand.  “Rusal stands to benefit from the stronger aluminum prices
in an overall commodity price rally,” said Helen Lau, a Hong
Kong-based analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd.  Moscow-based Rusal, which beat analyst forecasts for
second-quarter profit, will report its third-quarter earnings on
Nov. 12. Aluminum prices may rise next year as China scales back
production, Rusal said in September.  The price of aluminum may rise to as much as $2,500 a
metric ton in 2011, Rusal First Deputy Chief Executive Officer
 Vladislav Soloviev  said Sept. 21. China may become a net
importer as domestic smelters cut output to curb costs and
reduce power consumption, he said.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story
