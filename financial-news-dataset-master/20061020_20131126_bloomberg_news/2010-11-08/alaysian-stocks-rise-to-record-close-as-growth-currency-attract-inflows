Malaysian stocks rose, driving the
benchmark index to a record close, as government plans to boost
the economy and an appreciating currency bolstered foreign
investment in the market to a two-year high.  The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index climbed 0.5
percent to 1,519.72 at the 5 p.m. close in Kuala Lumpur. The
measure remains below the intraday all-time high of 1,524.69 on
Jan. 14, 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
