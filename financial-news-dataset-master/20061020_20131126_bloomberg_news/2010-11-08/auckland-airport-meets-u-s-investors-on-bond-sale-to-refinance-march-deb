Auckland International Airport Ltd. ,
New Zealand’s largest, is meeting private bond investors in the
U.S. to discuss selling notes to refinance debt due in March, it
said in a statement today.  Auckland Airport plans to issue at least $100 million of
bonds and hired Commonwealth Bank of Australia to help manage
the transaction, a person familiar with the matter said, asking
not to be identified as the details are private.  The airport joins Mighty River Power and Transpower New
Zealand Ltd. in approaching U.S. private investors as New
Zealand companies seek to diversify their financing sources and
take advantage of record-low yields in the world’s biggest
corporate bond market. It has a NZ$125 million ($99 million)
term loan due in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mighty River Power, an Auckland-based state-owned
electricity generator, said Nov. 3 it raised $200 million by
selling 10-, 12- and 15-year bonds. Wellington-based Transpower
sold $150 million of 12-year notes in September, a person
familiar with the matter said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
