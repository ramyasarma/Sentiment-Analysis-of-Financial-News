The United Arab Emirates doesn’t plan
to abandon its currency peg to the declining dollar, a central
bank official said.  “At this moment and this time we’re not considering” de-
pegging, Seif al-Shamsi, senior executive director at the
central bank’s treasury department, said in Abu Dhabi today.
“The reasons that we have are that oil is priced with the
dollar” and more than half the country’s trade is linked to the
dollar.  All of the  Gulf Cooperation Council’s  members except Kuwait
peg their currencies to the dollar. The Secretary-General of the
GCC,  Abdul Rahman al-Attiyah , said yesterday that the five
members who link their currencies are not expected to reconsider
their pegs.  The dollar slid versus 15 of its 16 major counterparts last
week after the Federal Reserve said it will buy $600 billion of
U.S. Treasuries through June. The  Dollar Index , which
IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses to track the dollar against
the currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the
euro and yen, fell 0.9 percent to 76.548, from 77.266 on Oct.
29, in the biggest weekly loss since Oct. 8. The dollar is down
2.8 percent against the euro this year.  The GCC, which is comprised of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
U.A.E., Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, supplies about a fifth of the
world’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
