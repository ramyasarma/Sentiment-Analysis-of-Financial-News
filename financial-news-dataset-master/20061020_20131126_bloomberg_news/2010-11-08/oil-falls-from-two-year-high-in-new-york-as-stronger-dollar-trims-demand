Oil declined from its highest level
in two years as the dollar strengthened against the euro,
curtailing crude’s appeal as a protection against inflation.  Futures advanced to $87.49 a barrel, the highest level
since Oct. 9, 2008, before dropping as the euro fell on concern
that Ireland will struggle to plug its budget deficit. Hedge
funds increased bullish bets on oil to the highest level since
at least June 2006, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed last week, even before the Federal Reserve
said it will boost debt purchases to revive the economy.  “Today we’re seeing some of the gains get eaten away as
the dollar regains strength against the euro,” said  Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Bache Commodities Ltd. in London.
“Hedge funds have been helping to kick the market higher after
last week’s intervention from the Fed and as demand from China
continues to boom.”  Crude for December delivery fell as much as 68 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $86.17 a barrel, in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $86.41 at 12:56 p.m.
London time. Brent crude for December settlement traded at
$87.63 a barrel, down 48 cents, on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London.  Funds and other large speculators increased wagers on
rising prices by 8.6 percent in the seven days ended Nov. 2, the
CFTC said in its Nov. 5 report.  Jobs Increase  Oil prices jumped 6.7 percent last week, the most since
February, as the Labor Department said U.S. payrolls climbed by
151,000 workers in October following a revised 41,000 drop the
prior month. New York futures, which surged 78 percent in 2009,
are up about 10 percent this year.  “The market has taken heart in the unemployment rate,”
said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity Broking
Services Pty in Sydney. “Crude has broken through the topside
of the range, so you’ve got to look for higher prices.”  Europe’s currency tumbled before European Union Economic
and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  arrives in Dublin
today to confer with policy makers on spending cuts and tax
increases. The euro slid 0.9 percent to $1.3909, after reaching
$1.4282 on Nov. 4, its highest level since Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
