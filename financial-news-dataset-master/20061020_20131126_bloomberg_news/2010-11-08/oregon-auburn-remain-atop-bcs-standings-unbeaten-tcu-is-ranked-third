The University of Oregon remains the
No. 1 team in college football’s Bowl Championship Series
standings, with Auburn University second.  Oregon (9-0) and Auburn (10-0) are followed by Texas
Christian University (10-0) and Boise State (8-0). Louisiana
State (8-1) is the highest-ranked one-loss team at No. 5 after
beating defending national champion Alabama 24-21.  The teams that finish the regular season at No. 1 and No. 2
in the BCS standings will play for the national championship on
Jan. 10 in Glendale, Arizona. The BCS is determined using the
USA Today coaches’ poll, the Harris Interactive poll and six
computer rankings.   Stanford is sixth, while Wisconsin, Nebraska, Ohio State
and Oklahoma State round out the top 10. The final BCS standings
will be released Dec. 5.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
