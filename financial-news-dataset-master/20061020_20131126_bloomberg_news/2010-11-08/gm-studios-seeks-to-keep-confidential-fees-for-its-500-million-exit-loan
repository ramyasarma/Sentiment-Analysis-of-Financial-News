Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.,
bankrupt distributor of the James Bond and Rocky movies, asked
for court permission to keep confidential the fees for its $500
million exit loan.  MGM seeks to file under seal its request to pay fees for
the loan, through agent JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to
papers filed today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in  Manhattan . The
company said it needs the money to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy by
Dec. 2 and plans to seek approval of the loan on Nov. 12.  “The fee letter contains sensitive, confidential
information, the disclosure of which could harm the commitment
parties and lead to the debtors being forced to incur greater
costs in connection with obtaining exit financing,” lawyers for
MGM wrote.  MGM filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 3 with a so-called
prepackaged plan to move it through court in 30 days. The Los
Angeles-based company said at the time it needs $500 million for
operations, including new movies and television series, after
the bankruptcy.  The case is In re Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studies Inc. 10-
15774, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
