McDonald’s Corp. , the world’s largest
restaurant chain, said comparable-store sales climbed 6.5
percent last month from a year earlier, as it lured more U.S.
customers with items such as frappes and a Monopoly promotion.  Analysts projected global sales would advance 5.4 percent,
the median of four  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales at
restaurants open at least 13 months rose in all regions, the
retailer said today in a statement.  The Oak Brook, Illinois-based company attracted customers
outside regular meal times by adding coffee beverages and fruit
smoothies. The return of Monopoly, the board game promotion
where customers obtain game pieces with food purchases, also
fueled U.S. sales.  McDonald’s  rose 1 cent to $79.31, a record high, at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
gained 27 percent this year, compared with a 9.7 percent
increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Sales rose 5.6 percent in the U.S., 5.8 percent in Europe
and 5.3 percent in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, the
retailer said.  On Oct. 21, McDonald’s forecast global October sales of 5
percent to 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
