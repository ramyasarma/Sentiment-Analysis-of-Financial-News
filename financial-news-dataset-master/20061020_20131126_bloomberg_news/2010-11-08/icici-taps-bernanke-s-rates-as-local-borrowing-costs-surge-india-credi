India banks are selling the most
dollar-denominated debt in at least a decade, taking advantage
of near-zero U.S. benchmark rates after Reserve Bank of India
Governor Duvvuri Subarrao raised borrowing costs six times.  Mumbai-based ICICI Bank Ltd., the nation’s second-largest
lender by assets, sold $1 billion of 5.75 percent, 10-year bonds
yesterday that yield 325 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The spread on its
2016 debt, sold in July, was 320 basis points. The new offering
adds to $6.6 billion raised overseas in 2010 by the nation’s
banks, topping the $4.6 billion issued by Chinese lenders.  Subbarao’s rate  increases  have pushed government 10-year
yields up 42 basis points to 8.01 percent this year, compared
with 2.54 percent for Treasuries. India’s overseas bond-rush
helped sustain a 21 percent increase in bank lending in the year
through Oct. 22, even as the RBI sought to slow the fastest
inflation after Argentina in the Group of 20 nations.  “India’s economic growth is high and this increases the
financing needs for Indian banks and corporates,”  Cornel Bruhin , a fund manager in Zurich at Clariden Leu AG, which
manages $3.5 billion of emerging-market debt including that of
Axis Bank Ltd. and ICICI, said in an interview yesterday. “The
level of indebtedness is still relatively low and general
investor demand for India debt is still very high.”  ICICI’s 2020 drew $5 billion of orders, a person familiar
with the deal said, declining to be named as the data is
private. Asian and U.S. investors each bought 42 percent of the
notes and Europe-based managers took the rest. Barclays Plc,
Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG arranged the sale.  Widening Gap  The yield on India’s 2020 notes rose five basis points
yesterday, widening the gap to 548 basis points over similar-
maturity Treasuries. The spread was 567, or 5.67 percentage
points, on Oct. 20, the  widest  since 2001, according to
Bloomberg data. India’s wholesale-price index averaged 9 .7
percent  in the first nine months, while consumer prices rose
11.1 percent in Argentina and 1.1 percent in the U.S.  India’s government bonds returned 4.2 percent this year,
the third-worst performance among 10 local-currency debt markets
outside Japan, indexes compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc show. India
plans to auction 110 billion rupees ($2.48 billion) of bonds due
in 2017, 2020 and 2040 on Nov. 12, the finance ministry said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday.  India’s rupee weakened 0.3 percent to 44.385 per dollar
yesterday, trimming its appreciation this year to 4.8 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Concerted’ Actions  Subbarao said Nov. 2 that “concerted” policy actions by
the central bank will help slow the  inflation  rate to 5.5
percent by March 31. He forecast India’s $1.3 trillion economy
may expand 8.5 percent in the 12 months ending March 31, the
fastest pace in three years.  India’s banks faced their worst cash crunch on record in
the past month, prompting the RBI to buy back 83.5 billion
rupees of government bonds on Nov. 4, the first such move since
September 2009.  Lenders borrowed 1.2 trillion rupees of overnight loans
from the central bank on Oct. 29, an all-time high, to meet cash
shortages after investors pulled deposits to buy shares being
issued by Coal India Ltd. in an initial public offering last
month. Such borrowing averaged 532 billion rupees a day between
Oct. 1 and Nov. 5, more than twice the amount in September, RBI
data show.  Rates on three-month  commercial paper  sold by Indian
companies almost doubled this year to 8.16 percent, following an
88 basis-point surge in October, according to Bloomberg data.
U.S. three-month Treasury bills yielded 0.127 percent.  State Bank of India  Sales by ICICI’s larger competitor, State Bank of India,
climbed to $3.2 billion from $897 million in 2009, Bloomberg
data show. The Bank of Baroda Ltd. raised $1.28 billion over the
same period, up from $61 million in 2009.  “This is an opportunistic move because of the tight
liquidity onshore and relatively high cost of deposits
onshore,”  Christopher Leow , a fund manager in Singapore at
CIMB-Principal Asset Management Ltd., which overseas more than
$6 billion globally including Axis Bank and HDFC Bank Ltd, said
in an interview yesterday. “This reflects a growing demand for
dollar loans from Indian corporates.”  ICICI last month said second-quarter profit climbed 19
percent as loans rose for the first time in two years, beating
analysts’ estimates. SBI yesterday said profit was little
changed in the same quarter, missing the market consensus.  The cost to protect against losses on debt of State Bank of
India, a government-controlled lender that is the nearest
measure for sovereign debt, declined 3 basis points to 156.2
basis points on Nov. 5, the lowest since April 27, according to
New York-based CMA’s data on credit-default swaps.  ICICI Swaps  Those tied to the debt of ICICI fell 10 basis points last
week to 189, the lowest since Oct. 15, CMA data show. That
compared with 42 for U.S. government debt.  Credit-default contracts pay the buyer face value if a
borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  The Fed and Chairman Ben S. Bernanke announced on Nov. 3 a
plan to buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries through
June, expanding record stimulus in a bid to reduce unemployment
and avert deflation. It spent $1.7 trillion through March 2010
in the first round of so-called quantitative easing.  “The Fed’s plan to purchase government bonds means
investors in the U.S. have much less to buy,”  Tetsuo Ishihara ,
a senior credit analyst in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co., an
arm of Japan’s third-largest bank by market value, said in an
interview yesterday. “At the same time, Indian banks need to
raise funds as their economy is strong.”  U.S. President  Barack Obama  told business leaders in Mumbai
on Nov. 6 that increased trade between India and the U.S. is a
“win-win” proposition that would create jobs in both the
countries. As part of Obama’s visit, Reliance Power Ltd. won a
$5 billion line of credit from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to
fund renewable energy and gas plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
