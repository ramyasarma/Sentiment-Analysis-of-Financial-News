Assicurazioni Generali SpA , Europe’s
third-biggest insurer, may say quarterly  profit  rose on higher
premiums and investment income.  Net income in the third quarter probably increased to 452
million euros ($636 million) from 390 million euros a year
earlier, according to the  average estimate  of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The estimates ranged from 288 million
euros to 588 million euros.  “We expect a solid quarter, supporting expectations that
the group will meet its profit target for 2010,”  Ralph Hebgen 
an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Ltd. who has a “market
perform” recommendation on the stock, wrote in a Nov. 3 report.  European insurers including Aviva Plc and Axa SA are
posting higher sales as bond and equity markets rebound from the
financial crisis. Generali Chief Executive Officer  Giovanni Perissinotto , who in August forecast higher operating margins
and net income this year, is trying to expand in emerging
markets and eastern Europe to boost profitability.  Premiums at the company’s non-life business probably rose 4
percent to 4.8 billion euros, while life premiums may have
increased 1.6 percent to 11.3 billion euros, according to the
survey.  The Trieste, Italy-based insurer is scheduled to  report
earnings  on Nov. 11 and hold a conference call the same day at 4
p.m. Following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and the
year-earlier results. The figures are in millions of euros.
