Gold declined in New York as a
stronger dollar curbed demand for an alternative asset,
prompting investors to sell the metal after its rally to near a
record. Silver pared a gain to a 30-year high.  Gold futures earlier today traded 20 cents below a record
$1,398.70 set Nov. 5, and spot prices reached an all-time high
in London. The euro slid against the dollar as concern that
Ireland will struggle to plug its budget deficit curbed demand
for the region’s assets. Bullion typically moves inversely to
the greenback, which fell to a nine-month low versus the euro
last week.  “The dollar moved stronger, which influenced the gold
price to trade lower,” said  Bayram Dincer , an analyst at LGT
Capital Management in Switzerland. “Gold trades at elevated
levels. We expect the next direction to be toward lower prices,
as profit-taking may be necessary.”  Gold futures for December delivery lost $6, or 0.4 percent,
to $1,391.70 an ounce at 8:09 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The
metal for immediate delivery in London was little changed at
$1,392.85 after earlier today reaching a record $1,398.60.  Bullion fell to $1,390 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,395.50 at the afternoon fixing on Nov. 5.  Currency Debasement  Gold is up 27 percent this year and is heading for a 10th
annual gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920 in
London, partly on demand for an alternative asset to protect
against the debasement of currencies. Precious metals have
outperformed global equities, Treasuries and most industrial
metals this year as central banks maintained low interest rates
and governments spent trillions of dollars to spur growth.  European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  arrives in Dublin today to confer with policy makers
on spending cuts and tax increases. The Irish government laid
out a plan last week to cut spending and raise taxes by as much
as 6 billion euros ($8.4 billion) in 2011.  Group-of-20 economies should consider using gold as a
reference point for market expectations of currency values,
inflation and deflation as they reform the global monetary
system, World Bank President  Robert Zoellick  said. While
textbooks may view gold as “old money,” markets use it as an
alternative monetary asset, Zoellick wrote in today’s Financial
Times.  Bullion Supply  “We do not believe that a form of the gold standard is
viable,” UBS AG analyst  Edel Tully  said today in a report.
“Any reserve currency needs a supply that can grow as rapidly
as global trade. Gold supply falls significantly short of this
basic requirement.”  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products were unchanged at
2,085.85 metric tons on Nov. 5, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings increased for the first
time in 15 days on Nov. 4 and reached a record 2,104.65 tons on
Oct. 14.  Silver for December delivery in New York added 0.3 percent
to $26.815 an ounce after reaching $27.015, the highest level
since March 1980. Prices are up 59 percent this year. Silver
reached an all-time high of $50.35 in New York in 1980, a year
after the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market.  An ounce of gold bought as little as 51.7677 ounces of
silver in London today, the least since July 2008, before the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. triggered the worst
recession since World War II.  ‘Overextended’ Silver  “There is an air of euphoria around silver, as it seems to
be unable to put a foot wrong,” Standard Bank Plc said in a
report dated Nov. 5. “The market is overextended, however, and
we must caution that there is the possibility of a sharp
correction, at least toward $23. In its current mood, though,
any such dip would be likely to find buyers.”  Silver futures’ 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of
whether a commodity is overbought or oversold, is at 76.7. Some
analysts and traders who study technical charts view readings
above 70 as signaling a potential impending drop.  Palladium for December delivery was 1.1 percent higher at
$692.60 an ounce after reaching $700.20 on Nov. 5, the highest
price since April 2001. It’s up 69 percent this year. Platinum
for January delivery declined 0.4 percent to $1,761 an ounce.
Prices reached $1,799.50 on Nov. 4, the highest level since July
2008. Both metals are used mostly to make jewelry and pollution-
control devices for cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
