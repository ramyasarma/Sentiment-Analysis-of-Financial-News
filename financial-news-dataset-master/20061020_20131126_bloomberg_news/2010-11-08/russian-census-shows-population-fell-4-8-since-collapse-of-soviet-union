Russia’s population may have declined
4.8 percent since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991,
according to the first national census in eight years.  Preliminary data of the survey puts the population at 141.2
million people, the government’s official Rossiyskaya Gazeta
newspaper reported today, citing Alexander Surinov, head of the
Federal Statistics Service. That figure may rise after polling
is completed in remote areas and Russians temporarily living
abroad are included, Surinov said.  Russia’s population peaked at 148.3 million in 1991 and
reached 145.2 million in 2002, when the country last conducted a
census.  To contact the reporter on this story:
