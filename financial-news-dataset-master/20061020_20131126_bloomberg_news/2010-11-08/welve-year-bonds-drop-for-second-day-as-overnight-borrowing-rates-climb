India’s 12-year government  bonds  fell
for a second day as overnight borrowing rates in the local money
market climbed, reducing demand for debt securities.  The yield on the most traded bonds due in 2022 rose to a
one-week high, after the cost of borrowing funds overnight in
the interbank market reached 7.5 percent, the highest level this
month. That deterred banks, the biggest buyers of government
debt, to buy securities with borrowed funds.  “The liquidity situation is something that is not going to
support bonds in the short-term,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-
income trader at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “I am
expecting bonds to weaken further.”  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022 rose
to 8.03 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, from 8.02 percent
on Nov. 4, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
price fell 0.03, or 3 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 100.78.  Markets were closed on Nov.5 for a holiday.  Indian banks have been relying on the central bank for
 daily funds  through securities repurchase agreements since Sept.
9. They borrowed a net 1.16 trillion rupees ($26 billion) today,
the highest since Oct. 29.  Bonds rose earlier on speculation the central bank will
purchase existing securities to ease a cash shortage in the
financial system.  The  Reserve Bank of India  last week bought bonds through an
open-market auction for the first time since September 2009. The
central bank on Nov. 4 bought 83.5 billion rupees of debt, after
offering to purchase as much as 120 billion rupees.  “Investors are optimistic the central bank will help ease
the cash crunch that we are experiencing,” said  Roy Paul ,
deputy general manager at Mumbai-based Federal Bank Ltd.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
was little changed. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive a
floating rate, was 6.68 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
