Rohm Co. , a Japanese chipmaker, said
second-quarter net income doubled as demand recovered for flat-
panel TVs and other consumer electronics. It cut its full-year
profit forecast by 50 percent because of the yen’s strength.  Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 was 5.67
billion yen ($70 million),  Eiichi Sasayama , an executive in
charge of accounting and finance, said today at a briefing in
Osaka. That compares with 2.31 billion yen a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg data. Sales rose 1.8 percent.  The company plans to produce more components abroad to
counter the strength of the yen, which has risen 13 percent
against the U.S. dollar since April 1.  “The yen had a big effect on first-half sales,”  Satoshi Sawamura , Kyoto-based Rohm’s president, said at the briefing,
adding that the company expects the yen to average 80 yen per
dollar in the second half.  Rohm reported operating profit, or sales minus the cost of
goods sold and administrative expenses, rose about 58 percent to
13.4 billion yen in the second quarter, beating the 11.7 billion
yen average of four analysts’ estimates surveyed by Bloomberg.
Revenue was 91.4 billion yen, less than the 93 billion yen
average of four analysts.  Rohm cut its full-year net income forecast to 12.5 billion
yen from 25 billion yen, according to a statement released
before markets closed. The company’s stock, which had risen
earlier,  fell  3.1 percent to close at 4,990 yen on the Osaka
Securities Exchange, the biggest drop in three weeks. The Nikkei
225 Stock Average gained 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
