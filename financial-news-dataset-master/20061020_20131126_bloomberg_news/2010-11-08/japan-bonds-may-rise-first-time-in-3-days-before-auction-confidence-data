Japan’s 10-year  bond  futures declined
to a seven-week low as speculation increased that deflation will
ease and a government report showed China was a net seller of
yen-denominated debt for a second-straight month.  Bond futures dropped for a third day after the Ministry of
Finance in Tokyo said China sold a net 769.2 billion yen ($9.5
billion) of Japanese bonds in September after offloading a
record amount of the debt in August. Japan’s five-year breakeven
rate, a gauge of traders’ expectations for consumer prices,
climbed to a nine-month high.  “China doesn’t seem to invest in Japan for long-term
returns but appears to regard the country as a market for short-
term profits,” said  Ayako Sera , who helps oversee about $310
billion in Tokyo as a strategist at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co.
“Gains in longer bond yields are probably influenced by
people’s expectations for inflation.”  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery lost 0.16 to
142.70 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They
reached 142.69, the lowest since Sept. 22.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond added half a basis
point to 0.965 percent as of 3:15 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1
percent security due September 2020 fell 0.046 yen to 100.314.  China sold a net 624.3 billion yen in short-term debt and a
record 144.9 billion yen in long-term bonds, according to data
released today by Japan’s finance ministry. The figures go back
to 2005.  Yield Spread  China may be selling Japanese securities on concern the yen
will weaken after it reached a 15-year high of 80.22 per dollar
on Nov. 1, said  Junichi Makino , a Tokyo-based senior economist
at Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd.  “If China sees 80 yen close to the currency’s possible
peak of appreciation, it makes sense for them to sell,” Makino
said. “Because Japanese debt has almost no yield, China can
only get returns from currency gains.”  Benchmark 10-year yields sank to a seven-year low of 0.82
percent on Oct. 6, a day after the Bank of Japan cut its key
interest rate to a range of zero to 0.1 percent and announced
the creation of a 5 trillion yen fund to buy domestic debt.  Traders expect Japan’s consumer prices to fall 0.862
percent annually for the next five years, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the most since Feb. 9 for the breakeven
rate, or the difference between yields on five-year inflation-
linked bonds and conventional debt.  Deflation, or a general drop in prices, enhances the
purchasing power of the fixed payment from debt.  ‘Smooth’ Auction  Economy Minister Banri Kaieda today said he wants to beat
deflation by the end of fiscal 2012. Bank of Japan Deputy
Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi told lawmakers that the bank’s view
on consumer prices is more or less in line with that of the
government.  Japan sold 300 billion yen of 40-year bonds today. The
auction drew bids valued at 4.15 times the amount on offer, the
highest since February 2009.  “The auction was smooth, as had been expected by market
participants,” said  Satoshi Yamada , chief quantitative analyst
at Tokyo-based Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  Declines in bonds were limited after a government report
showed confidence in the economic outlook worsened. The Economy
Watchers expectations index, a survey of barbers, taxi drivers
and others who deal with consumers, fell to 41.1 in October from
41.4 the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
