The euro may retrace its recent gains
against the Canadian dollar, according to Royal Bank of Canada,
citing technical indicators.  A close below the support level of C$1.3941 per euro would
confirm “that a topping pattern is in place” and accelerate
the decline,  George Davis , chief technical analyst for fixed
income and currency strategy in Toronto at the RBC Dominion
Securities unit of the bank, Canada’s largest lender, wrote in a
note today.  “This development would then expose C$1.3858, followed by
strong support at C$1.3691 as part of a corrective scenario,”
Davis wrote.  The euro fell as much as 0.7 percent to C$1.3939 today
before trading at C$1.3957 at 2 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.4037
on Nov. 5. The 16-nation currency has gained 5.8 percent against
the Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, since Sept. 8, when
the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate for the
third time in four months, bringing it to 1 percent.  A close above C$1.4348 would be needed to signal renewed
strength in the euro, Davis wrote.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security
commodity, currency or index. Support is a level where orders to
buy may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
