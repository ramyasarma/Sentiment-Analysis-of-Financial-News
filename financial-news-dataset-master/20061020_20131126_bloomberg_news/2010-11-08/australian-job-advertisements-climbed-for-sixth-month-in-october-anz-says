Australian job advertisements rose in
October for a sixth straight month, reinforcing evidence the
nation’s economic expansion will accelerate next year.  Jobs advertised  in newspapers and on the Internet climbed
0.6 percent from September, when they rose a revised 1.1 percent,
according to an Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
report released in Melbourne today.  Today’s report comes as surging shipments of iron ore and
coal to China stoke a jobs boom. Australia’s unemployment rate
probably fell to 5 percent last month from 5.1 percent in
September, a report will show on Nov. 11, according to a
Bloomberg survey of 24 economists.  “The medium-term outlook for labor demand remains
positive,” said  Ivan Colhoun , head of Australian economics at
ANZ. “In particular, with economic growth expected to
accelerate strongly in 2011-12, labor market conditions will
remain generally favorable with the unemployment rate expected
to push towards 4.75 percent and wage pressures to lift
modestly.”  National vacancies advertised in newspapers fell 0.3
percent in October, and Internet notices rose 0.6 percent,
today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter for this story:
