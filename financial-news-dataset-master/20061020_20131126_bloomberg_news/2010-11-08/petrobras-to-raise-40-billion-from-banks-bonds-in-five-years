Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, plans to raise $40 billion in the
next five years through bank loans and bond sales.  Petrobras also needs to refinance $38 billion in debt that
is due through 2014, Chief Executive Officer  Jose Sergio Gabrielli  said today at an event in Sao Paulo. Petrobras expects
oil prices to average $65 a barrel to $85 a barrel through 2015,
helping to finance spending, Gabrielli said.  “They’ve been quite successful at getting loans from
official agencies and China,” said  Eduardo Suarez , an emerging-
markets strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Petrobras
may sell bonds “soon” to take advantage of attractive interest
rates for corporate debt, he said, adding he expects $5 billion
a year in bond sales.  Petrobras plans to invest $224 billion for the five years
through 2014 to boost oil output and expand refining. The
company will revise its investment plan next year to include the
development of new oil reserves it bought from the government as
part of a $70 billion share sale, the largest in history.  The company will probably increase its spending plan after
it bought 5 billion barrels of undeveloped oil reserves from the
government as part of the September share sale, said Suarez.  Crude for December delivery fell 62 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $86.23 a barrel at 9:56 a.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Oil has gained 11 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
