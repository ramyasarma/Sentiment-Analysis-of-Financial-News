Botswana, the world’s biggest diamond
producer, will sell stock in its national telecommunications
company in February, President  Ian Khama  said.  The sale of Botswana Telecommunications Corp. will be
complete by April next year, Khama said today in speech to
parliament in the capital, Gaborone.  “The privatization of BTC will commence with an initial
public offer in which shares will be sold to citizens in stages
on condition that government will have the first option at
acquisition when citizen investors wish to dispose of their
shares,” he said.  The southern African country is trying to boost revenue to
close a budget gap of about 10 percent of gross domestic product
that widened when diamond exports fell during the global
economic crisis. The deficit was forecast at 12.2 billion pula
($1.9 billion), or 12.2 percent of GDP, for 2010/11 in the
budget, released in February.  The fiscal gap was 9.3 billion pula in the last fiscal
year, compared with a forecast of 13.4 billion pula, and is
estimated at 12.1 billion pula this fiscal year, Khama said.  The government is aiming to balance its budget by 2012/13,
Finance and Development Planning Minister  Kenneth Matambo  said
on Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
