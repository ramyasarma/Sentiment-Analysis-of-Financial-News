The Australian dollar fell for a
second day on concern that sovereign-debt burdens facing some
European nations will damp demand for higher-yielding assets.  Australia’s currency weakened against most of its 16 major
counterparts as the extra yield investors demand to hold Irish
and Portuguese 10-year notes instead of comparable German bunds
climbed to records. New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi,
dropped after the U.S. banned kiwifruit plant imports from the
South Pacific nation.  “Europe’s sovereign-debt concerns are worsening risk
appetite in the market,” said  Takuya Kawabata , a researcher in
Tokyo at Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd., a unit of Japan’s
largest foreign-exchange margin company. “This is negative for
commodity-related currencies such as the Aussie and kiwi.”  Australia’s dollar declined 0.2 percent to $1.0114 at 12:12
p.m. in New York, from $1.0136 yesterday. Earlier it fell 0.6
percent and touched $1.0074, the weakest since Nov. 4. It rose
to $1.0183 on Nov. 5, the highest level since exchange controls
were scrapped in 1983. The currency fell 0.3 percent to 82.02
yen, from 82.28.  New Zealand’s dollar slipped 0.1 percent to to 78.70 U.S.
cents, from 78.80 yesterday, and lost 0.2 percent to 63.83 yen,
from 63.96.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said yesterday
that private investors must be included in a future backstop
aimed at tackling sovereign defaults.  The yield difference, or spread, on Portugal’s 10-year
bonds over comparable German debt widened to as much as 452
basis points, or 4.52 percentage points. The spread on  Irish  10-
year securities over bunds reached 554 basis points. Portugal
and Ireland are among Europe’s most indebted countries.  The U.S. stopped imports of kiwifruit nursery stock from
New Zealand after a bacterial disease was discovered in a North
Island orchard, according to a spokeswoman for New Zealand’s
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
