Italy beat the U.S. yesterday to
retain the Federation Cup and deny its opponent a first title in
a decade in the most prestigious team competition in women’s
tennis.  Italy, the top-ranked nation, holds a 3-1 lead in the five-
match contest after last year beating the U.S. 4-0 in the final.
Italy has been in every final since 2006 and has now won the
tournament three times in five years.  Italy won both singles matches at the San Diego Sports
Arena. French Open champion  Francesca Schiavone  handed 18-year-
old world No. 114 Coco Vandeweghe a 6-2, 6-4 loss in her
tournament debut in her home town.  Flavia Pennetta  then defeated
Bethanie Mattek-Sands 7-6 (7-4), 6-2.  World No. 67  Melanie Oudin  beat the seventh-ranked
Schiavone 6-3, 6-1 in yesterday’s opening match to keep the
meeting alive before world No. 23 Pennetta defeated Vandeweghe
6-1, 6-2 to render the doubles contest irrelevant.  It was the second straight final the U.S. played without
 Venus  and  Serena Williams , who are injured. The U.S., which is
ranked third in the world, won the last of its record 17
Federation Cup titles in 2000 against Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
