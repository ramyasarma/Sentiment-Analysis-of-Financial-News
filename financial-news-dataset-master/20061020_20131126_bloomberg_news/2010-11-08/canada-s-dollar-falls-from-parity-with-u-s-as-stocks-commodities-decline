Canada’s currency dropped from parity
as the greenback rallied against all of its major counterparts
except the yen on reduced demand for assets related to economic
growth including stocks.  Canada’s currency rose along with the greenback against the
euro on concern  Ireland  will struggle to contain its deficit.
The loonie traded on a one-for-one basis with the U.S. dollar on
Nov. 5 for the first time in three weeks after the Federal
Reserve said two days earlier it would buy $600 billion more in
debt under the policy known as quantitative easing.  “The U.S. dollar seems to be rebounding, and the Canadian
dollar seems to be getting caught up in that,” said  Aaron Fennell , a futures and currency broker in Toronto at Lind-
Waldock, a unit of MF Global Holdings Ltd. “It’s like letting
go of an elastic band now that they’re done talking about
quantitative easing.”  The Canadian dollar slid for the first time in eight days
versus the U.S. dollar, depreciating 0.4 percent to C$1.0036 at
5 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0001 on Nov. 5, when it advanced to
99.92 Canadian cents, the strongest level since Oct. 14. One
Canadian dollar buys 99.64 U.S. cents. The loonie advanced 0.5
percent to C$1.3970 versus the euro.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 0.2 percent today.
Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, lost 0.1 percent
to $86.73 a barrel after dropping as much as 1 percent. The
loonie tends to rise and fall with stocks and commodities as a
proxy for risk appetite.  ‘Selling Opportunity’  Gains in the U.S. dollar to C$1.0115 and C$1.0157 would be
“a selling opportunity” after it failed to drop below 99.77
Canadian cents for a third time,  George Davis , chief technical
analyst at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital unit in Toronto,
wrote in a research note to clients.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year bond  yield  increased today four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.89 percent. The
price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June 2020 fell 32
cents to C$105.10.  The nation’s government debt has lost investors 0.2 percent
this month, paring returns in 2010 to 7 percent, according to a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he’s
“apprehensive” about slowing global growth and urged world
leaders meeting this week in South Korea to coordinate policies.  Flaherty, in prepared remarks of a speech he’s giving today
in Jakarta, said the risk is that countries may end up seeking
to cheapen their exchange rates unilaterally to bolster exports.
Group of 20 nations must implement its “comprehensive package
of global reforms and continue to demonstrate resolve and
cohesion,” Flaherty said.  G-20 Meeting  G-20 leaders meet in Seoul on Nov. 11-12 to try to find
common ground for sustaining the global recovery.  Canadian  housing starts  fell in October by the most since
April 2009, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. reported today.
Starts dropped 9.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace
of 167,900 from a revised 185,000 in September. The figure
trailed all 21 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey, which had a
median forecast of 183,000.  The U.S. dollar has fallen against all of its major
counterparts since July 31 on speculation the unconventional
monetary-easing policies of the Fed will erode the value of the
world’s main reserve currency.  The currency of Canada, which ships about two thirds of its
exports to the U.S., has fallen against all of its peers except
the pound and dollar since the end of July.  “The Canadian dollar is going to lag because of its
proximity and reliance on the U.S.,” said  John Curran , a senior
vice president in Toronto at CanadianForex Ltd., an online
foreign-exchange dealer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
