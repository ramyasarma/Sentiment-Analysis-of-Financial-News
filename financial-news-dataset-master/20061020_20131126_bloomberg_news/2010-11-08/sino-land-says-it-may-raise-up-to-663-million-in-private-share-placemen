Sino Land Co. , the Hong Kong
developer controlled by billionaire  Robert Ng , fell the most in
almost two years in Hong Kong trading after saying it will raise
HK$5.14 billion ($663 million) in a private sale of shares.  The shares dropped 7.3 percent to HK$16.94 as of 10:08 a.m.
local time, the biggest decline since Jan. 8, 2009. The company
will sell 305 million shares at HK$16.85 apiece in a top up
placement, according to a  statement  to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. That’s a 7.8 percent discount from yesterday’s
close.  Sino Land, which reported a 2.6 percent drop in full-year
profit excluding revaluation gains in September, said it will
use the funds as working capital.  The shares today were downgraded to “reduce” from “buy”
by  Keith Yeung , an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities.  Hang Lung
Properties Ltd. , Hong Kong’s third-biggest developer by market
value, fell by the most in 21 months on Nov. 5 after placing
shares to raise about HK$10.9 billion.  Home prices  in Hong Kong have surged 51 percent since the
beginning of 2009 on record low mortgage rates and an influx of
mainland Chinese buyers, prompting the city’s government to
announce a series of measures since October to curb the
formation of an asset bubble.  The company derives almost all of its sales and profit from
property development and investment in Hong Kong.  The developer’s shares have gained 13 percent in Hong Kong
trading this year, compared with the 18 percent increase in the
 Hang Seng Property Index , of which Sino Land is a member. The
stock fell 1.7 percent to HK$18.28 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
