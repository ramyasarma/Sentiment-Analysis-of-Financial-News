Mexico’s peso dropped for the first
time this month as concern grew that European governments will
struggle to pay their debts and cut deficits.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 12.2254 per dollar at 5 p.m.
New York time, from 12.2024 on Nov. 5. The currency, which has
gained 7.1 percent this year, advanced for seven consecutive
days before today, the longest streak of gains since Sept. 16.  “There is some nervousness in the market right now because
of the European situation,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency
strategist at Base Internacional Casa de Bolsa SA in Monterrey,
Mexico. “Most of the European situation is already priced in,
so we won’t see markets affected like they were earlier this
year.”  Ireland will open its books to European Union officials
today, as the Chinese government offered to help Portugal, and
Greece said it will go ahead with cutting debt.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.42 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.23 centavo to 133.14 centavos per peso.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. The bank has been
auctioning $600 million in dollar options monthly, allowing it
to purchase dollars as it seeks to boost foreign reserves after
the peso reached a record low last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
