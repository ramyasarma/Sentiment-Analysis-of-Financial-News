Sugar production at Uganda’s three
biggest plants rose 3.7 percent in the first nine months this
year because of increased capacity, the Uganda Sugar Cane
Technologists’ Association.  Production rose to 222,954.1 metric tons from 214,938.8
tons in the same period last year, Wilberforce Mubiru, the
association’s secretariat manager, said today by e-mail from the
capital, Kampala. The three factories account for about 98
percent of the country’s production, the association said.  Output dropped 8.7 percent at Kakira Sugar Works Ltd., the
biggest producer, and 1.2 percent at Sugar Corp. of Uganda Ltd.,
he said. Kinyara Sugar Works Ltd., the second-biggest plant,
increased production by almost 30 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
