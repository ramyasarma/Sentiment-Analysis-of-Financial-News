Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
will “insist” on global coordination of any so-called
quantitative easing measures by government when he meets with
counterparts from the Group of 20 nations this week.  Such actions will need to be planned in advance in order to
avoid creating risks for other markets and economies, senior
Kremlin economic adviser Arkady Dvorkovich told reporters in
Moscow today.  Russia will also argue against instituting targets on
current account surplusses or deficits, Dvorkovich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
