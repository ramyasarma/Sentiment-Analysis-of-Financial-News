Ambac Financial Corp., the holding
company for the bond insurer being rehabilitated by Wisconsin
regulators, may file for bankruptcy in Manhattan as early as
this week to restructure more than $1 billion in bonds and other
claims, according to a person familiar with the situation.  Ambac said earlier this month it was trying to negotiate
terms of a  bankruptcy court  restructuring with senior lenders.
If it’s unable to reach agreement with creditors “in the near
term,” the company said, it would file for bankruptcy by the
end of the year without creditor approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
