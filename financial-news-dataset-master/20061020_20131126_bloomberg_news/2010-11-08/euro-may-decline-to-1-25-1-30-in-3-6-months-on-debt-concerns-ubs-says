The euro’s advance against the dollar
this quarter may be short-lived as renewed concern over the
region’s debt problem may push the currency down to $1.25-$1.30
in the next three to six months, according to UBS AG.  UBS said it maintains a bearish view on the common currency
as the further it rises above $1.40, the more growth in the euro
region will be impaired. The bank sees the currency’s “long-
term fair value” at $1.20.  The euro’s gain will reduce “even further the prospects of
peripheral euro zone economies being able to generate sufficient
tax revenues to pay back their debts,” wrote  Mansoor Mohi- uddin , the Singapore-based global head of currency strategy at
UBS. “We remain skeptical about the euro at $1.40-$1.42.”  The bank published its note today after meeting 60 European
clients last week, Mohi-uddin said. The extra yield investors
demand for holding 10-year Irish bonds over German bunds surged
80 basis points last week as the government struggles to
convince investors it won’t need a bailout.  “During our client meetings, we were surprised that many
investors believed euro zone peripheral-market developments
would not impact the euro,” wrote Mohi-uddin. “By the end of
the week, that consensus was shifting after Irish 10-year bond
yields traded around 7.50 percent and Greek yields spiked ahead
of Sunday’s local elections.”  The euro fell 0.9 percent to $1.3907 today after reaching
$1.4282 on Nov. 4, the highest since Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
