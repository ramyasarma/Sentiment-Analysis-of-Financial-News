About two of five U.S. motorists say
they have fallen asleep at the wheel, and more than a quarter
say they were so tired that they struggled to keep their eyes
open while driving in the past month, a AAA study found.  The AAA, the largest U.S. motoring club, is working to
increase safety by reducing risky behavior. About one in six
fatal crashes involve a drowsy driver, the group said, citing
data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  “Sleepiness decreases awareness, slows reaction time, and
impairs judgment, just like drugs or alcohol,” said Peter
Kissinger, chief executive officer of the AAA Foundation for
Traffic Safety, in a  statement  today. “We need to change the
culture so that not only will drivers recognize the dangers of
driving while drowsy, but will stop doing it.”  Drivers should get at least six hours of sleep before a
long trip, schedule a break every two hours and travel at times
when they are normally awake, the group said. Drifting from a
lane and tailgating may be signs of drowsiness.  The data come from a telephone survey of 2,000 U.S.
residents aged 16 or older, conducted in May and June, the
foundation said. The results were released to coincide with
Drowsy Driving Prevention Week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
