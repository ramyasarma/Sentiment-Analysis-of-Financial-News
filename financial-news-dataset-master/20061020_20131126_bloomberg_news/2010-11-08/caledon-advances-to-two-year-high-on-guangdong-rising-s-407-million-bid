Caledon Resources , a producer of
coking coal in Australia, rose to the highest in more than two
years in London trading after agreeing to a possible cash
takeover by Guangdong Rising Assets Management Co.  Caledon jumped 17 percent to the highest since July 11,
2008. Guangdong will pay 112 pence a share, valuing the London-
based company at 251.6 million pounds ($406 million). The offer
is a 34 percent premium to the closing share price on Nov. 5.  “Caledon would provide a platform for future expansion in
Australia and the region” by Guangdong Rising, according to a
statement published today. The Chinese company would sell coal
to buyers in China, the companies said in the statement.  The U.K. company, whose directors support the bid, rose 14
pence to 98 pence by the 4:30 p.m. close in London trading.  The takeover is subject to regulatory approval in China and
completion of financing for the deal by Guangdong Rising, as
well as Caledon’s board receiving confirmation from advisers RBC
Capital Markets that the transaction is “fair and reasonable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
