  Abu Dhabi Polymers Co. , the state-
controlled plastics maker known as Borouge, is conducting a
study to determine marketing and sales efforts once current
plant expansions are complete, its chief executive officer said.  The second phase of Borouge’s expansion, including a 1.5
million-ton-a-year ethane cracker, is finished and will reach
full capacity by the middle of 2011, Abdulaziz Al Hajri said
today at an industry event in Abu Dhabi. The company’s third
phase, Borouge 3, is to be built and operating in late 2013.
Borouge aims to produce 4.5 million tons of petrochemicals
annually, with three ethane crackers, Al Hajri said.  Persian Gulf oil producers including the United Arab
Emirates, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, and Saudi Arabia
are expanding petrochemicals production to benefit from selling
both crude and more valuable refined and derived products.  Borouge, a joint venture between Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.
and International Petroleum Investment Co.’s Borealis A/S,
receives natural gas supplies from the state producer. Gas
supplies are already allotted for the Borouge 3 project, and the
new units will use additional propylene feedstock as it becomes
available from an expansion of the Ruwais crude refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
