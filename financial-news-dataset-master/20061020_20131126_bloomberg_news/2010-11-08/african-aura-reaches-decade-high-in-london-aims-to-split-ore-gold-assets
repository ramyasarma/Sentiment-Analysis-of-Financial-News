African Aura Mining Inc., developer
of a Liberian iron ore project with  OAO Severstal , rose to the
highest level in more than a decade in London after announcing
plans to transfer its gold assets to a new company.  African Aura  gained as much as 5.1 percent to the highest
point since Jan. 24, 2000. It plans to focus on iron ore and
transfer gold assets to Aureus Mining Inc., with shareholders
owning stakes in both African Aura and the gold business.  The proposal “we hope will provide the best means to
unlock value for the exciting potential in the company’s
tenement prospects,” analysts at Fairfax IS in London including
 John Meyer  wrote in a note to investors today.  African Aura climbed 4 pence, or 2.5 percent, to 167 pence
by 12:33 p.m. in London trading, valuing the company at 117.4
million pounds ($190 million).  The separation of the gold and iron-ore businesses will
“allow shareholders to benefit from the value of owning a share
in each of two dedicated pure play entities,” African Aura
Chief Executive Officer  Luis da Silva  said in the statement.  Russia’s largest steelmaker Severstal in September agreed
to a 25-year plan to develop the Putu iron ore mine with Liberia
in West Africa, with investment in the project expected to reach
$2.5 billion. Severstal, which has a 61.5 percent stake in the
project, plans to produce 20 million metric tons of iron ore a
year at the site. African Aura owns a 38.5 percent holding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
