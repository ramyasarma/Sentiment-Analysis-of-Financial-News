The European Union said it will open
a contest tomorrow for the first portion of about 5 billion
euros ($7 billion) in subsidies to store carbon dioxide
underground and promote renewable energy.  The EU will invite bids for “clean coal” and renewable
aid that will come from the planned sale of as many as 300
million allowances to emit carbon dioxide under region’s cap-
and-trade program.  The commission has appointed the European Investment Bank
to select projects, convert the allowances and manage revenue.
About 50 percent of project costs will be covered.  Cash will be disbursed to at least eight carbon capture and
storage demonstration projects, and one project from each
category of eligible clean energy technologies. Those include
bio-energy plants, on- and offshore-wind farms, solar arrays,
hydropower plants, marine energy systems and geothermal power
plants.  Bidders are required to demonstrate that projects will be
operational by the end of 2015 and all necessary permits should
be in place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
