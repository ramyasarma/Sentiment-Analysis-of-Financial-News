An overview of activity since markets
closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES  New York: U.S. stocks fell, dragging benchmark gauges down from
two-year highs, as a five-week rally left the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index at the highest valuation since May and concerns over
Irish debt curbed demand for riskier assets.
*Anadarko Petroleum Corp. fell the most in the S&P 500, losing
5.5 percent, after Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said BHP Billiton
Ltd. is a “more likely bidder” for Woodside Petroleum Ltd. than
Anadarko.
*The S&P 500 decreased 0.2 percent to 1,223.37 at 1:26 p.m. in
New York, after earlier declining as much as 0.7 percent.
*The Dow slipped 34.86 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,409.22.  London: Most European stocks declined after the benchmark Stoxx
Europe 600 Index climbed to a six-month high last week.
*Commerzbank AG dropped the most in eight months after profit
missed analysts’ estimates. Gartmore Group Ltd. plunged 15
percent after saying fund manager Roger Guy will retire.
*Greece’s ASE Index rose 1.3 percent as Prime Minister George
Papandreou’s initial victory in local elections reduced the
chance of an early national poll.
*The Stoxx 600 was little changed at 271.91 as of the 4:30 p.m.
close of trading in London, as four stocks fell for every three
that gained.  Tokyo: Japanese stocks rose, driving the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average to its highest level in more than three months, after a
government report last week showed the U.S. added more jobs than
forecast, and as commodity prices increased.
*The Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 1.1 percent to 9,732.92,
the highest close since July 28.
*The broader Topix index gained 0.8 percent to 841.74, with
about three stocks climbing for each one that fell.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index  slipped
0.5 percent to 4,778.40 as at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in
Sydney. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index declined 0.1 percent to
3,316.40 at the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The euro fell for a second day versus the dollar as
concern that some governments in the region will struggle to pay
their debt increased, curbing demand for its assets, as Ireland
opens its books to the European Union.
*The yen and dollar rose against all of their most-traded peers
as attention turned to European sovereign debt from the Federal
Reserve’s plan to buy bonds under quantitative easing.
*The euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.3934 at 2:17 p.m. in New York.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasury three-year notes fell after the government
sold $32 billion of the securities, the first of three offerings
this week of $72 billion in notes and bonds.
*The securities drew a yield of 0.575 percent, compared with the
0.577 percent average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.. The
bid-to-cover ratio was 3.26, compared with 2.95 in the previous
auction.
*The yield on the three-year note rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 0.54 percent at 1:04 p.m. in New York.  COMMODITIES  METALS  New York: Copper fluctuated in New York as a stronger dollar
sapped demand for commodities as an alternative investment,
prompting some investors to sell the metal after last week’s
rally.
*Copper for delivery in December was little changed at $3.95
a pound at 9:13 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The contract
added as much as 0.8 percent and lost as much as 0.7 percent.  GOLD  New York: Gold topped $1,400 an ounce, extending a rally to a
record, on investor demand for an alternative to currencies.
Silver reached a 30-year high, and palladium climbed to the
highest price since 2001.
*Gold futures for December delivery rose $9.40 or 0.7
percent, to $1,407.10 at 12:30 p.m. in New York. Earlier,
futures rose to a record $1,407.20.  OIL  New York:  Oil retreated from its highest level in two years as
the dollar strengthened against the euro, curbing crude’s appeal
as an alternative investment.
*Crude for December delivery was unchanged from Nov. 5 at
$86.85 a barrel at 12:52 p.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  WHAT TO WATCH
