China’s middle-income and affluent
consumers will probably almost triple in 10 years with the bulk
of the increase coming from smaller cities,  Boston Consulting
Group Inc.  said today.  There will be 270 million more consumers whose annual
household incomes exceed 60,000 yuan ($9,000) in the world’s
 most populous country  by 2020, said Carol Liao, a partner at the
Boston-based consulting company. That would lift the total
number of middle-class and affluent Chinese to 415 million from
148 million now, she said.  “China is no doubt the highlight of the global consumer
sector, and second-tier and third-tier cities are the main
driving force within the Chinese market,” Liao said at a
briefing in Beijing today. Three-quarters of the growth will
come from smaller cities as incomes rise, she said.  “Middle-income consumers in smaller cities are expected to
become the new blood in  China’s consumption ,” Liao said. They
also have a greater potential to save because their living costs
are lower than in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen,
she said.  Boston Consulting surveyed more than 7,000 consumers in 28
Chinese cities in 2010.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
