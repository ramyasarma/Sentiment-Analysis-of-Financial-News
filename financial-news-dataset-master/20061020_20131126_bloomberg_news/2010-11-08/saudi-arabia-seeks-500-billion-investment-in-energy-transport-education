Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil
supplier, has $500 billion in investment opportunities in
energy, transportation and education, according to the state-run
body that promotes investments.  “We have identified investment opportunities in Saudi
Arabia and divided them into three areas,” Saudi Arabian
General Investment Authority Governor  Amr Al-Dabbagh  told
reporters in Dubai today. There is $300 billion in investment
opportunities from now until 2020 for the energy industry,
including petrochemicals, minerals, power and water, he said.  Economic and population growth in Saudi Arabia, the Arab
world’s largest economy, is spurring demand for investment in
infrastructure, energy and education. Saudi Arabia expects its
economy to expand 3.5 percent this year as the kingdom benefits
from higher crude prices.  Saudi Arabia also wants to attract $100 billion in
investments to expand airports, ports, railway networks and
logistic hubs, Al-Dabbagh said. It is also seeking $100 billion
for its knowledge-based industries, including education, health
life sciences and information technology, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
