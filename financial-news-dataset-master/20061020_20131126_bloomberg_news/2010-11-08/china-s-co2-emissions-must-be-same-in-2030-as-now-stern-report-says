China’s rising carbon dioxide
emissions must return to today’s level by 2030 if warming since
pre-industrial times is to be kept to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6
degrees Fahrenheit), London School of Economics professor
 Nicholas Stern  said.  China, the biggest emitter, has set itself a target of
cutting greenhouse gases per unit of gross domestic product by
40 percent to 45 percent from 2005 through 2020. That would
still expand its total emissions because of the nation’s
economic growth rate, Stern said today in an e-mailed paper.  “Low-carbon growth in China is vital both for China’s
future and that of the world as a whole,” said Stern, who in
2006 published a widely cited study of climate-change economics
for the British government. “Green policies should be at the
heart of the 12th and 13th five-year plans,” he said, referring
to China’s economic planning documents that will cover the
periods 2011 through 2015 and 2016 through 2020.  China’s efforts already to reduce emissions and boost
renewable energy place it at the forefront of the “global green
industrial revolution,” according to Stern’s paper. His
comments come three weeks before United Nations climate envoys
are due to resume talks in Cancun, Mexico, where they aim to
craft a global treaty to fight global warming.  China’s incentives to encourage low-carbon growth are
almost triple those in the U.S., the Sydney-based Climate
Institute said last month. Ernst & Young said on Sept. 8 that
the Asian nation overtook the U.S. to top a quarterly index of
the most attractive countries for renewable-energy projects.
Even so, China relies on coal, the dirtiest of the major fossil
fuels, to produce about 80 percent of its electricity.  Stern’s 2006 report said global warming may cost the world
as much as 20 percent of the world’s gross domestic product
because of the effects of famine, rising sea levels, storms and
other environmental damage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
