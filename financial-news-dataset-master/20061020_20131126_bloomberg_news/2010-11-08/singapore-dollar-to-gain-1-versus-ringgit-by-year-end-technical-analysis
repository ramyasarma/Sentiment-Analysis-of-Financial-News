Singapore’s dollar may advance almost
1 percent against Malaysia’s ringgit by the end of this year
after its moving average formed a “golden cross” formation,
according to Okasan Securities Co.  The 50-day moving average of the city-state’s currency rose
above the 200-day line last week, a “bullish” signal that
suggests it could strengthen to 2.4205, according to  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency dealer at Okasan. The target level
represents a 76.4 percent rebound of its drop from a Nov. 30
high of 2.4620 to a two-year low of 2.2860 reached on April 9,
Soma said, citing the Fibonacci chart that is based on a
sequence of numbers.  “The trend is intact for the Singapore dollar to
strengthen against the ringgit,” Tokyo-based Soma said. “It
could move toward the target level by the end of December.”  The Singapore dollar gained 0.1 percent to 2.4003 against
Malaysia’s currency as of 10:43 a.m. local time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 2.4065 on Nov. 5, the
strongest level since March 4.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Other significant levels are 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent and 50
percent. In technical analysis, investors and analysts study
