Qatar submitted a proposal to amend
the rules of United Nations’ emissions-market to include carbon-
capture and storage projects, the country’s oil minister said.  “Qatar Petroleum has officially submitted to the UN a
proposal for a new methodology that could enable carbon dioxide
capture and storage in geological formations to be part of the
Clean Development Mechanism,” Qatari Minister  Abdullah al- Attiyah  said today at a conference in Doha. “We believe that
Qatar’s proposal, if adopted, could make a major contribution to
controlling the global emissions of carbon dioxide.”  Adding carbon-capture to the list of projects approved by
the UN, which runs the world’s second-biggest emissions market, 
will be debated at global climate talks starting Nov. 29 in
Cancun, Mexico. The process involves piping CO2 into storage
underground or aging oil fields before its escapes into the air.  Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are among the first oil
producers in the Middle East to seek UN credits for alternative-
energy projects. Qatar has registered a project to reduce
flaring of natural gas from the Al-Shaheen oil field.  Qatar qualified for UN credits known as offsets, designed to
encourage richer countries to finance carbon-reductions in
developing nations. China and India together have supplied 68
percent of UN offsets so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
