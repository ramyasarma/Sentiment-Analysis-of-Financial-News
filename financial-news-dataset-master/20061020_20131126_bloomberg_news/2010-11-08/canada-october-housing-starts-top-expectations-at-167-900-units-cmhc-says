Canadian  housing starts  fell in
October by the most since April 2009, Canada Mortgage and
Housing Corp. reported.  Starts declined 9.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
pace of 167,900 from a revised 185,000 in September, Canada
Mortgage and Housing Corp. said from Ottawa today. The reading
trailed all 21 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey, which had a
median forecast of 183,000 and a low of 175,000.  The Bank of Canada  said last month  that housing will be a
drag on economic growth next year, after several temporary
stimulus measures for homeowners lapsed. Starts should slow to a
pace closer to 175,000 next year from 184,900 this year, CMHC
said today.  “Housing is unlikely to be a strong contributor to GDP
growth the way it was in the early stage of the recovery,”
 Krishen Rangasamy , an economist at CIBC World Markets in
Toronto, wrote in a note to clients.  Single-family starts in cities fell 8 percent to 57,700
units, while urban multiple dropped 15 percent to 84,700 units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
