Polimex-Mostostal SA, Poland’s
largest builder, said third-quarter net income fell to 17.3
million zloty ($6.17 million) from 33.8 million zloty a year
earlier due to a 12 percent decrease in construction sales. That
compares with the 27 million zloty mean estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Polimex-Mostostal said third-quarter sales totaled 1.17
billion zloty, up from 1.15 billion zloty a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
