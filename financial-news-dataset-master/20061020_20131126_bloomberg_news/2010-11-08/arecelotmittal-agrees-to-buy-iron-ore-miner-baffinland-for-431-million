ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. , a
unit of the world’s largest steelmaker, agreed to pay about
C$433 million ($431 million) for Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. to
secure supplies of the steelmaking raw material iron ore.  ArcelorMittal SA offered C$1.10 a share, its Luxembourg-
based parent said in a statement today. That’s a 16 percent
premium to the closing price on Nov. 5 and 38 percent higher
than an 80 cent bid from Nunavut Iron Ore Acquisition Inc. on
Sept. 22, according to a separate statement from Toronto-based
Baffinland, which recommended the steelmaker’s proposal.  ArcelorMittal, the parent, said September it would spend $4
billion to boost iron-ore output to 100 million metric tons by
2015. It’s seeking to raise self-sufficiency after prices for
iron ore and coal surged this year on demand from China, the
largest steel producer. BHP Billiton Ltd., Vale SA and Rio Tinto
Group, the three biggest iron ore exporters, also switched to
quarterly supply contracts instead of annual agreements.  “The offer is in line with ArcelorMittal’s strategy of
expanding its mining portfolio and selectively adding to its
existing pipeline of high quality development projects,” Chief
Executive Officer  Aditya Mittal  said in the statement.  Baffinland’s Mary River project contains reserves of 365
million tons of iron ore, ArcelorMittal said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
