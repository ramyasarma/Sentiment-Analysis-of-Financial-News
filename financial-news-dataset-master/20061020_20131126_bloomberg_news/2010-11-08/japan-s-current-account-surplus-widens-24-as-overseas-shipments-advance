Japan’s current-account surplus
widened in September as exports increased, indicating that
demand from Asia has helped offset the impact of a yen near its
highest level against the dollar since 1995.  The  gap  expanded 24 percent from a year earlier to 1.96
trillion yen ($24 billion), the Ministry of Finance said in
Tokyo today. The median estimate of 22 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a surplus of 1.684 trillion yen.  Japanese companies from Toyota Motor Corp. to Sony Corp.
are benefitting from Asian demand. Risks to Japan’s recovery
this quarter include slower global growth and damage to exports
from the yen at a 15-year high, said economist  Yoshiki Shinke .  “The impact of the strong yen and weakening global demand
will be more apparent,” Shinke, senior economist at Dai-Ichi
Life Research Institute in Tokyo, said before the report.
“Japan’s recovery is likely to lose momentum at least through
early next year.”  Exports climbed 16 percent, while imports advanced 11
percent, today’s report showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
