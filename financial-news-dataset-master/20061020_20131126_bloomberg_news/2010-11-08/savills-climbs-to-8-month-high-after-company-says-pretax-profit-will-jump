Savills Plc , Britain’s largest
publicly traded property broker, climbed to the highest in
almost eight months in London trading after the company said
earnings will rise more than 60 percent this year.  Pretax profit, excluding one-time gains and disposal
proceeds, will exceed 40 million pounds ($65 million), according
to a statement from the London-based company today. These
earnings, known as underlying profit, amounted to 25.2 million
pounds last year.  There has been a pickup in sales of commercial property and
high-end homes in the U.K., where Savills generates more than
half its revenue, though volumes are slowing in the final
quarter, the company said. Savills predicted a record year in
Hong Kong and said sales in Australia and Singapore are also
beating forecasts.  Savills rose 13.5 pence, or 3.9 percent, to 359.8 pence,
the highest since March 19. The shares have appreciated 12
percent this year, lifting the market value of the company to
474 million pounds.  The profit forecast reflects “the continued strength of
our trading performance, particularly in Asia, and the potential
completion of some significant London transactions prior to the
year end,” the broker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
