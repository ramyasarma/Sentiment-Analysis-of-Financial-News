Arabica-coffee prices rose to a 13-
year high in New York on speculation that adverse weather will
disrupt supplies in Vietnam, the world’s second-largest grower.
Sugar and cocoa gained, while orange juice fell.  Rains may delay Vietnam’s harvest, which usually starts in
November in the Central Highlands, according to  Andrea Thompson ,
an analyst at CoffeeNetwork in Belfast, Northern Ireland. World
output may drop next season because of a smaller harvest in
Brazil, the biggest grower, the International Coffee
Organization said last week. Prices in New York have advanced 53
percent this year as stockpiles hover near a record low.  Above-average rainfall in Vietnam may have “quality
impacts” on robusta and arabica coffee crops, said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures Group Inc. in
Chicago.  Arabica coffee for December delivery climbed 2.95 cents, or
1.4 percent, to settle at $2.081 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, prices reached $2.097, the
highest level since August 1997.  Coffee stockpiles in producing nations dropped to about 12
million bags this year, the lowest level since the London-based
ICO began keeping records in the 1960s,  Jose Sette , the
executive director of ICO, said in an interview Nov. 4.  A bag weighs 132 pounds, or 60 kilograms.  “All the production news, the Vietnam news, that’ll give
the market a base,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision
Financial Markets in Chicago. There will be “continued
volatility” between $2 and $2.10 this week, he said.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery
gained $60, or 3 percent, to settle at $2,046 a metric ton at
5:30 p.m. on NYSE Liffe. Earlier, the commodity reached $2,058,
the highest price since Oct. 2, 2008.  Sugar, Cocoa Rise  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.12 cent, or 0.4
percent, to settle at 31.88 cents a pound in New York. Earlier,
the sweetener reached 32.3 cents, the highest price for a most-
active contract since Jan. 8, 1981. Sugar has rallied for nine
straight sessions.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery fell 30
cents to settle at $778.30 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for March delivery climbed $54, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $2,828 a ton in New York. On NYSE Liffe,
cocoa futures for December delivery gained 43 pounds, or 2.4
percent, to settle at 1,829 pounds ($2,950) a ton.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery declined 1.6
