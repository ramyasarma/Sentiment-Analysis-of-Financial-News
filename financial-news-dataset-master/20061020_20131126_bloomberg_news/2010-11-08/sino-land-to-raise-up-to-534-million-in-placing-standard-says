Sino Land Co.  aims to raise as much
as HK$4.14 billion ($534 million) in private placement of 242
million shares to be priced in the range of HK$16.60 to HK$17.10
each, the Standard said, citing a term sheet.  The developer plans to use the proceeds from the sale for
“general corporate purposes,” the Hong Kong-based English-
language newspaper reported today. Goldman Sachs (Asia) is the
placing agent for the sale, the Standard said.  The stock fell 1.7 percent to HK$18.28 in Hong Kong
yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
