Banks’ “fear” of fines from the
U.K. Financial Services Authority is causing them to boost
numbers of regulatory-compliance staff, a recruiting firm said.  More than 700 of the 5,231 jobs created in financial
services in the City of London last month were in the areas of
compliance, product control and management of risk, the
recruitment firm Astbury Marsden said.  “We are being told by clients that a lot of these new jobs
are being created because the FSA is still taking such an
aggressive line on fining organizations,”  Mark Cameron , Astbury
Marsden’s chief operating officer, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Tougher enforcement of regulatory rules has caused the
amount of fines handed down by the FSA to soar in recent years.
The FSA has handed down 84.3 million pounds ($136.8 million) in
fines so far in 2010, more than double the 35 million pounds
collected in 2009.  “The increase in fines reflects a renewed focus on
enforcement since 2007,” Christopher Hamilton, an FSA
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  Banks are also recruiting staff in anticipation of new
rules on bank capital from the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, Astbury Marsden said.  Recruitment of traders slowed down last month as part of a
“seasonal trend,” Cameron said.  To contact the reporter on this story
