Groupama SA  may have to sell its
shares in  Mediobanca SpA  to win regulatory approval for the
planned purchase of a stake in the company that controls insurer
 Fondiaria Sai SpA , Corriere della Sera reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Regulators may make the request because Mediobanca controls
Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Italy’s largest insurer, according
to the weekly business supplement of the newspaper. Groupama
Chief Executive Officer  Jean Azema  also may have to leave his
position on the board of Mediobanca, Corriere reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
