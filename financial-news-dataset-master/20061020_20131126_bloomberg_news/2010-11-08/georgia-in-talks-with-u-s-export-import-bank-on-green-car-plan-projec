Georgia is in talks with the  U.S.
Export-Import Bank  on plans to spend as much as $200 million on
electric and hybrid cars in a bid to create the first “green
government” among the former Soviet republics.  The government plans to buy about 4,000 cars in the next
three to four years from producers such as General Motors Co.,
Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp., said Economy Minister
 Vera Kobalia . The cars will cost an average of about $32,000
apiece, she said.  “It’s natural for us to become a green country,” Kobalia
said in an interview in the capital Tbilisi late yesterday.
“Our products are organic and we have hydropower resources, so
why not?” President  Mikheil Saakashvili  backs the initiative,
she said.  Kobalia said the government will auction off many cars from
its existing fleet. Georgia also plans to build a streetcar line
in Tbilisi.  Long-term savings on fuel will offset the high purchase
price of electric and hybrid cars, making this a viable project
for the government, said Davit Narmania, executive director of
the Tbilisi-based Caucasian Institute for Economic and Social
Research.  Kobalia, 29, was born in Georgia’s breakaway Abkhazia
region. Her family fled the region during a civil war in the
early 1990s and emigrated to Canada, where she earned a degree
in business administration from the British Columbia Institute
of Technology, according to her official biography. She holds
Canadian in addition to Georgian citizenship. Kobalia said she
drives a hybrid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
