The yuan fell for the first time in
five days, halting its longest winning streak in more than a
month, as concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen bolstered
demand for dollars.  The People’s Bank of China weakened the reference rate 0.12
percent to 6.6692 against the dollar today to reflect the
strength of the greenback. The U.S. Dollar  Index  traded on ICE
futures in New York, which tracks the currency against those of
six major trading partners, has risen 1.5 percent in the last
two days, rebounding from an 11-month low reached on Nov. 4.  “The dollar’s rebound determined today’s yuan move,” said
 Guan Jiaying , a Beijing-based analyst at China Citic Bank Co., a
unit of China’s biggest state investment company. “We probably
won’t see more dollar declines because there are more problems
in the European economy.”  The yuan fell 0.32 percent to close at 6.6781 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency has strengthened 2.2 percent since a two-year
dollar peg ended on June 19.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.6 percent
to 6.4761 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency will
strengthen 3.1 percent in a year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Nov. 6 he
expects China to make its yuan exchange rate more flexible over
time. He made the comments in Kyoto, Japan, after a finance
ministers’ meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum. Leaders from the Group of 20 nations will meet in Seoul
on Nov. 11-12.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
