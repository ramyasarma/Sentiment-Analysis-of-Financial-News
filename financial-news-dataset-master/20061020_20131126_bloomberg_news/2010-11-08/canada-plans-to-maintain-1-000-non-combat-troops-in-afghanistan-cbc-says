Canada plans to keep as many as 1,000
troops in Afghanistan in a non-combat role after its military
mission ends in 2011, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.  reported 
today, without saying where it got the information.  The troops -- as many as 750 trainers and 200 support staff
-- will stay no later than 2014, the CBC also reported. Canadian
soldiers will be located outside combat zones, the CBC said.  Canada currently has about 3,000 troops in Afghanistan and
its military mission is scheduled to end in July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
