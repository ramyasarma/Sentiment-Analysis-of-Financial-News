United Parcel Service Inc. , the
world’s largest package-delivery business, plans a benchmark
bond sale to pay for pension-fund contributions as companies
face increasing retirement obligations in the future.  Proceeds from the debt due in 2021 and 2040 will be used to
fund domestic pension plans whose contributions are otherwise
payable over five years, Atlanta-based UPS said today in a
regulatory filing. It joins  Boston Properties Inc. ,  Icahn
Enterprises LP  and AutoZone Inc. in marketing and selling debt
today.  UPS Chief Financial Officer  Kurt Kuehn  said in an Oct. 21
conference call that the company’s pension expenses may be
“volatile” in 2011 as discount rates tumble to “the lowest in
recent history.” U.S. corporate pension plans fell this year
into their biggest financial hole ever because interest rates
plummeted to 1960s levels, according to  David Bianco , chief U.S.
equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  “One should fully expect a continuation of stepped-up
contributions throughout the balance of this year,” said
 Kenneth Hackel , president of Alpine, New Jersey-based research
and consulting firm CT Capital LLC. “The ramifications are much
bigger than investors realize.”  UPS’s U.S. pensions were underfunded by $2.41 billion on
Dec. 31, 2009, and by $3.49 billion a year earlier, according to
its most recent annual report.  Funding Reversal  The numbers compare with overfunding of $2.49 billion in
December 2007, according to the company’s 2008 annual report.
UPS has pension funding commitments of about $1 billion a year
through 2012. The amount declines to $509 million in 2013, it
said in the 2009 report.  The gap between pension-fund assets and projected payouts
widened to $380 billion this year for companies in the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index , Bianco estimated in an Oct. 29 report. The
shortfall worsened as interest rates fell, he wrote.  The 2021 notes UPS is now planning to offer may yield 65
basis points to 70 basis points more than similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries, and its 30-year bonds may pay a spread of 85 basis
points to 90 basis points, according to a person familiar with
the transaction. The notes may be issued as soon as today, said
the person, who declined to be identified because terms aren’t
set. Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million.  Norman Black , a spokesman for UPS, said he couldn’t discuss
details of how the company plans to use the proceeds.  Bond Yields  Investment-grade corporate bond yields fell to 3.53 percent
on Nov. 4, the lowest on record, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. The  S&P 500 Index  has returned about 11.4
percent this year, including reinvested dividends.  Many investors are assuming that because the S&P 500 is up
this year that companies “are bailed out from making additional
stepped-up contributions,” Hackel said. “The decline in bond
yields has completely overridden the advance in stock markets
this year.”  “A side effect of companies reducing the risk of their
pension funds is their returns are declining as well,” said  Guy LeBas , chief fixed-income strategist and economist at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “In order to compensate
for declining returns, companies need to provide increasing
funding for their pensions.”  Boston Properties  Boston Properties, the U.S. office real estate investment
trust led by  Mortimer Zuckerman , sold $850 million of notes;
billionaire  Carl Icahn ’s Icahn Enterprises may sell $500 million
of bonds in a reopening and AutoZone, the biggest U.S. auto-
parts retailer, sold $500 million of debt, Bloomberg data show.  Companies sold $15.8 billion of debt on Nov. 4, which was
the most since Sept. 8, the busiest day of issuance this year,
Bloomberg data show.  UPS last issued debt in March 2009, when the company sold
$2 billion of 5- and 10-year notes, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Pension plans are 77 percent funded at S&P 500 companies
this year, down from 82 percent at the end of last year, Bianco
estimated. The percentage is the lowest since at least 1994,
according to the report.  UPS’s 5.125 percent notes due in 2019 traded on Nov. 1 at
117.497 cents on the dollar to yield 2.78 percent, or 14.3 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Seventeen companies are offering or have sold at least $11.2
billion of debt today, as daily volume exceeded $10 billion for
the second time this month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Corporate bond sales this year may reach $1 trillion
today if all the debt being marketed is priced, Bloomberg data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
