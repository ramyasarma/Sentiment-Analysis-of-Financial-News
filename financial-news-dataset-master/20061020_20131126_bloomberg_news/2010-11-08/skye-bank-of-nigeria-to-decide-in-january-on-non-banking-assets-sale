Skye Bank Plc , a Nigerian lender,
will announce in January whether it will keep or sell its non-
banking units, spokesman Kayode Akinyemi said.  “Discussions are going on at the executive and board
levels, and by January we will be in a position to advise on
what our operations will be,” he said in an interview from
Lagos today.  Skye Bank has units in areas including insurance, mortgage,
stockbrokerage, and investment banking, Akinyemi said.  The Central Bank of Nigeria in September asked the nation’s
lenders to sell their non-banking units or adopt a holding
company model. All financial institutions regarded as universal
banks have to prepare plans to comply with the policy not later
than Jan. 2, the central bank said.  The rules form part of changes to the banking industry,
which amassed bad debts of about $10 billion that threatened to
collapse some of the operators. The central bank fired the chief
executive officers of eight of the country’s 24 lenders last
year and used 620 billion naira ($4.1 billion) to bail out the
industry. Skye is not one of the bailed-out lenders.  The stock dropped to the lowest in almost two weeks,
retreating 2.2 percent to close at 7.09 naira by 1 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
