Rolls-Royce Group Plc  said the cause
of the Trent 900 blowout that grounded Qantas Airways Ltd.’s
fleet of A380s superjumbos is specific to that engine model, as
it seeks to dispel concern about its flagship turbine family.  The A380 engine failure on a Nov. 4 Qantas flight is
unconnected to the Trent 1000 blast that happened on Aug. 2
“during a development program with an engine operating outside
normal parameters,” the company said in a statement. A Qantas
Boeing Co. 747 aircraft also equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine
encountered an engine failure the day after the A380 incident.  The A380 blowout was the first of its kind on a large civil
engine built by the company since 1994, Rolls-Royce said. The
company will provide more information when it updates investors
on trading Nov. 12, it said. No one was injured in the events.  “A series of checks and inspections has been agreed with
Airbus, with operators of the Trent 900-powered A380 and with
the airworthiness authorities,” Rolls said. “These are being
progressively completed which is allowing a resumption of
operation of aircraft.”  Rolls-Royce shares rose 2.7 percent to 607 pence in London
today, erasing earlier losses and valuing the London-based
company at 11.4 billion pounds ($18.4 billion). The stock lost
almost 10 percent of its value in its last two sessions last
week.  The stock dropped to as low as 563 pence per share today,
valuing the company at 10.5 billion pounds and wiping 1.7
billion pounds off its market value from its closing price of
654.5 pence, the day before the incident.  Last week’s two incidents have no immediate impact on the
company’s credit risk, Fitch Ratings said in a statement today.
Any design flaw with the Trent 900 that comes to light during
investigations would lead to a “material financial and
reputational impact on Rolls-Royce,” the ratings agency said.
Rolls-Royce’s debt is rated A- with a stable outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
