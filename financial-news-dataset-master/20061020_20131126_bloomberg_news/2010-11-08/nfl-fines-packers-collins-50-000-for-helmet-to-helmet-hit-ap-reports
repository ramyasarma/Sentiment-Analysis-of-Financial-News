The National Football League fined
Green Bay Packers safety  Nick Collins  $50,000 for a helmet-to-
helmet hit on Dallas Cowboys receiver  Roy Williams , the
Associated Press  reported .  Collins “violently and unnecessarily struck a defenseless
receiver” in the head with his helmet in a “flagrant violation
of player safety rules,” AP said, citing unidentified officials
in a league statement.  Collins collided with Williams after an incompletion in the
third quarter of Green Bay’s win over the Cowboys yesterday at
Lambeau Field. Collins received a penalty for unnecessary
roughness and Williams said after the game that Collins didn’t
deserve a fine.  Randall Liu, an NFL spokesman, didn’t immediately return a
telephone call and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
