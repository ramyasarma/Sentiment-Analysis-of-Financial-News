Australian Prime Minister Julia
Gillard will argue for special consideration for the nation’s
strong banks at the Group of 20 summit amid a global push to
overhaul rules on capital to prevent another financial crisis,
the Australian Financial Review newspaper reported.  “It’s an issue we’re confronting because of our
comparative strength,” Gillard told the newspaper in an
interview before the G-20 meeting in Seoul on Nov. 11-12. “We
do need special consideration of Australia’s position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
