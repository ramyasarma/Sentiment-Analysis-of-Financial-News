Skymark Airlines Inc. , Japan’s
biggest low-cost carrier, said it plans to buy four  Airbus SAS 
A380 superjumbo aircraft, putting it on track to become the
first Japanese customer for the world’s biggest passenger plane.  Skymark aims to use the planes starting in the fiscal year
beginning April 2014 and will sign a purchase agreement next
spring, according to a  statement  today on the company’s website.
The four-plane order is worth 1.39 billion euros ($1.9 billion)
at Airbus’s list prices.  The carrier, which has no scheduled flights outside Japan,
is adding routes and hiring pilots as  Japan Airlines Corp. ,
which filed for bankruptcy in January, slashes service and
retires its fleet of Boeing Co. 747s. Airbus is in negotiations
to sell Skymark four A380s, plus options for two more, spokesman
 Stefan Schaffrath  said by phone in Toulouse, France. He declined
to confirm an agreement was reached.  Skymark, which operates a fleet of 15 Boeing 737s, plans to
use the Airbus planes on long-distance flights, according to the
statement. The carrier also said it will sign an agreement on
options to buy two more of the planes.  The airline is considering flying the planes to the U.S.
and Europe, Kazusa Naito, a spokeswoman, said by telephone today.
The carrier hasn’t decided how many classes of service will be
in the superjumbo, she said. Skymark currently flies only
economy class in Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
