Argentine stocks retreated, halting a
record 12-day advance, on growing concern the European debt
crisis will slow the global economy.  Banco Hipotecario SA, Argentina’s sixth-largest lender by
market value, slid, paring a 92 percent advance in the past
three weeks, as concerns over Irish debt curbed demand for
riskier assets. Grupo Financiero Galicia SA lost 3.9 percent
after surging 59 percent since Oct. 19.  The  Merval index  fell 0.8 percent to 3,324.27 at 3 p.m. New
York time, its first retreat since Oct. 19 and ending the
longest streak of gains since at least 1988, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The index soared 23 percent in the past
three weeks, the steepest gain since May 2009, amid rising
commodity prices, the quickening economic expansion and
speculation that the death of former president  Nestor Kirchner 
will lead to reform.  “Bank stocks have been leading gains from before the news
of Kirchner’s death, in part due to the growth of credit in the
country and the reduction in country risk,”  Walter Chiarvesio ,
head of equity research in Argentina for Banco Santander SA,
said in a telephone interview today from Buenos Aires. “We’ve
seen strong demand for Argentine stocks from abroad, which may
mean that investors are positioning themselves for next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
