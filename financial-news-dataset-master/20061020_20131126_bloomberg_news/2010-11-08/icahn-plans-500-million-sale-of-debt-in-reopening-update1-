Icahn Enterprises LP , the holding
company for financier  Carl Icahn , plans to sell $500 million of
bonds due in 2016 and 2018 in a reopening, as the company takes
advantage of record-low borrowing costs.  The senior securities may be sold as soon as today,
according to a person familiar with the transaction. Proceeds
may be used for general corporate purposes, according to a
statement distributed by PR Newswire that didn’t specify the
timing of the sale.  The company, controlled by the billionaire’s New York-based
hedge fund, is selling bonds as it mounts a hostile takeover of
Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and as borrowing costs for
investment-grade companies fall to record lows. The average
absolute yield on investment-grade debt touched 3.53 percent on
Nov. 4, the lowest in daily readings that began in 1986,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate
Master Index.  Icahn Enterprises’ 7.75 percent securities due in January
2016 traded at 103.94 cents on the dollar Nov. 4 to yield 6.66
percent, or 557.6 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The company’s 8
percent notes due in January 2018 traded at 104.3 cents on the
dollar on Nov. 5, yielding 6.99 percent, or a 589.6 basis-point
spread, Trace data show. Icahn initially sold the bonds in
January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Price Guidance  The company may offer the reopened notes due in 2016 for
103.25 to 103.5 cents on the dollar and may sell the bonds due
in 2018 for 103.5 to 103.75 cents on the dollar, according to
the person familiar with the transaction, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  “With rates as low as they are now, and the other senior
notes trading at roughly 540 basis points over ridiculously low
Treasury rates, why not accumulate more cash for future buying
power?”  Barbara Cappaert , an analyst at Montpelier, Vermont-
based KDP Investment Advisors, said in a note to clients.
“Icahn has been very slow and prudent in its use of investing
cash.  “The company has ample cash and liquidity and has not been
aggressive in that use of cash in making operating
acquisitions,” Cappaert said.  Icahn Enterprises is rated BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.  U.S. corporations are hoarding almost $1 trillion of cash,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Borrowers have
bolstered their finances by slashing spending and raising funds,
selling $990.7 billion of U.S. corporate bonds this year,
following a record $1.23 trillion in 2009, Bloomberg data show.  “A growing number of bond issues and newly-rated bank loan
programs fund acquisitions,” Moody’s analysts led by  John Lonski  wrote in an Oct. 18 note to clients. “Expectations of
significantly higher borrowing costs by late 2010 or early 2011
may prompt a surge of pre-fundings.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
