U.K. stocks declined after the FTSE
100 Index posted its best week in nine last week.  African
Barrick Gold Ltd . and Royal Dutch Shell Plc led losses.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  fell 25.39, or 0.4 percent, to
5,849.96 at the 4:35 p.m. close in London. The FTSE All-Share
Index dropped 0.4 percent to 3,020.33, while Ireland’s  ISEQ
Index  added 0.8 percent, even as Irish bank stocks plunged.  The FTSE 100 jumped 3.5 percent last week, the best weekly
showing since the 4.4 percent on Sept.3, after the Federal
Reserve pledged to buy more securities to feed an economic
rebound. The measure is now trading near its most expensive
relative to expected earnings since April, according to
Bloomberg data, after touching the highest level in more than
two years last week.  “Having exhausted conventional monetary policy, the
Federal Reserve is busily exercising its two remaining options:
clutching at straws, and pushing on strings,”  Tim Price ,
director of investments at PFP Group in London, wrote in a note
today. “In the short term, though, stock markets and indeed
most other financial assets have reacted in classic Pavlovian
fashion: ring the dinner bell announcing fresh liquidity, and
they will rally in response. This should give equity investors
pause.”  The FTSE 100 Index is nearing “overbought” levels,
according to the  Relative Strength Index .  The FTSE 100’s 14-day RSI, which tracks momentum by
comparing closing prices with daily trading ranges, ended last
week at 69.77. When the RSI rises above 70, technical analysts
say the underlying security is “overbought” and likely to
fall. The measure last closed above 70 on April 6, 2010, after
which the FTSE 100 slid 17 percent through July 1.  ‘Uptrend Environment’  “The RSI rising to an overbought level in an uptrend
environment means investors shouldn’t buy stocks before the
market consolidates,” said  Achim Matzke , head of global index
and technical research at  Commerzbank AG  in Frankfurt. “It is
not a signal to sell in the short term. The indicator will fall
again as the uptrend is intact.”  African Barrick retreated 1.9 percent to 538.5 pence. The
shares were cut to “sell” from “neutral” at  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc ., which said it sees “better value elsewhere in the
sector.”  Shell dropped 1.2 percent to 2,058.5 pence. Europe’s
largest oil company is selling a 10 percent stake in  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd.  for $3.35 billion, freeing up funds to support a
six-fold increase in its Australian natural gas production.  Woodside may become a takeover target after Shell’s
disposal, analysts said. Woodside may be an acquisition target
for BHP Billiton Ltd., analysts at UBS AG said Nov. 4 in a
report. BHP, the world’s largest mining company, declined to
comment when contacted today. Its shares fell 0.8 percent to
2,430.5 pence.  Gartmore Group  Gartmore Group Ltd . plunged 15 percent to 107 pence. The
U.K. money manager that began trading its shares in December
said Chief Investment Officer  Dominic Rossi  is leaving to join
another company and leading fund manager  Roger Guy  is retiring
from “day-to-day” fund management at the end of 2010. Gartmore
has hired Goldman Sachs to advise on a sale or merger, it added.  Bank of Ireland  Plc decreased 4.2 percent to 41 cents,
taking the loss in 2010 to 52 percent. Irish Life & Permanent
Plc, the country’s biggest mortgage lender, slumped 16 percent
to 88 cents.  The cost of insuring against default on Ireland’s banks
surged to a record, as the country’s bonds tumbled for the 10th
consecutive day and the extra yield investors demanded to hold
the debt instead of benchmark German bunds rose to an all-time
high on concern the nation is struggling to redress its budget
deficit.       Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , the bank controlled
by the U.K. government, slid 3 percent to 43.64 pence.
Commerzbank AG, Germany’s second-biggest lender, slumped the
most since May in Frankfurt trading after reporting a third-
quarter profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  Inmarsat, Rolls-Royce       Compass Group Plc , the world’s largest catering company,
rose 2.6 percent to 537 pence as it topped levels that technical
analysts say indicate further gains. The shares today rose above
the 50-day and 100-day moving averages.  Inmarsat Plc jumped 3 percent to 695 pence, the steepest
advance in two months. The biggest provider of satellite
services to the maritime industry said third-quarter operating
profit rose 18 percent on “strong” demand for aeronautical and
leasing services.  Rolls-Royce Group Plc rose 2.7 percent to 607 pence,
reversing an earlier loss of as much as 4.7 percent, after
saying the cause of the Trent 900 blowout that grounded Qantas
Airways Ltd.’s fleet of A380s superjumbos is specific to that
engine model, as it seeks to dispel concern about its flagship
turbine family.  The A380 engine failure on the Nov. 4 Qantas flight is
unconnected to the Trent 1000 blast that happened on Aug. 2
“during a development program with an engine operating outside
normal parameters,” the company said in a statement. The shares
slumped 8.7 percent last week after a Qantas Boeing Co. 747
aircraft also equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine encountered an
engine failure the day after the A380 incident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
