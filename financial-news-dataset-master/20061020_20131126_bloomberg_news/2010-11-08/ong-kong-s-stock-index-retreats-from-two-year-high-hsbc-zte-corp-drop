Hong Kong  stocks  rose, extending the
benchmark index’s gain to its highest level in more than two
years, after a report last week showed the U.S. added more jobs
than estimated, fueling optimism in a global economic recovery.  China Merchants Holdings International Co. jumped 3.6
percent after the investor in ports moving about a third of
China’s containers said it will expand in Nigeria. Lumena
Resources Corp. soared 14 percent after the chemical company
agreed to buy a resin maker for HK$11.05 billion ($1.48 billion).
 HSBC Holdings Plc , Europe’s biggest bank, declined 1.6 percent

quarter of this year would be positive economic data from the
U.S.,” said  Francis Lun , general manager at Fulbright
Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong, who forecast the Hang Seng Index
may reach 26,000 by the end of the year. Still, “the market has
risen too much, too quickly, and that causes a bit of concern.”  The  Hang Seng Index  gained 0.4 percent to 24,964.37, its
highest close since May 22, 2008. That boosted the measure’s 14-
day relative-strength index, which has been above 50 since Sept.

an indicator to sell. The gauge fell as much as 0.6 percent
today.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies advanced 0.7 percent to 14,204.13.  China Merchants  The main Hang Seng Index has gained 14 percent this year on
expectations that growth in corporate earnings will weather
concerns about the pace of the U.S. economic recovery and
China’s steps to curb rising property prices. Shares in the
gauge trade at an average 15.8 times estimated earnings,
compared with about 17.2 times at the start of the year.  China Merchants  jumped 3.6 percent to HK$31.85. The company
will form a venture that will buy 47.5 percent of a container-
terminal operator in Nigeria for $154 million. China Merchants

with the China-Africa Development Fund taking 40 percent after
obtaining Chinese government approval.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. , a Hong Kong-based global fashion
retailer, rose 0.7 percent to HK$44.05.  U.S. Labor Department figures showed payrolls climbed by
151,000, exceeding the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Private payrolls that exclude government
agencies also gained more than forecast.  Rail Review  Lumena rallied 14 percent to HK$3.34. The company said
yesterday it entered into an agreement to buy as much as 95
percent of Sino Polymer New Materials Co.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.4 percent to 24,878.
More than 10 stocks gained for every four that dropped among the

growth slowed in the third quarter and that recovery in emerging
markets may be faltering.  CSR Corp., a railcar maker, slumped 6.6 percent to HK$9.02,
the sharpest drop among the Hang Seng Composite Index’s 320
constituents. China’s Ministry of Railways is reviewing high-
speed rail proposals after a report by the China Academy of
Science to the State Council raised questions about their
practicality and affordability, the Financial Times reported,
citing unidentified people it said were familiar with the matter.  ZTE Corp. , China’s second-largest maker of telephone
equipment, lost 1.8 percent to HK$30.15 after the Wall Street
Journal reported that Sprint Nextel Corp. won’t consider
products from ZTE and Huawei Technologies Ltd. for a contract
because of U.S. government security concerns.  Beijing Enterprises Water Group Ltd.  surged 5.7 percent to
HK$2.79 after Morgan Stanley rated the stock “overweight” in
