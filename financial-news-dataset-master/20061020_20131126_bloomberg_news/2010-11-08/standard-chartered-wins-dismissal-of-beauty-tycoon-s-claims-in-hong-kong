A Hong Kong court dismissed a local
beauty tycoon’s claims against  Standard Chartered Bank Ltd. 
over investments related to bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings 
Inc. because she didn’t suffer any direct losses.  Joyce Tsang Yue , chairwoman and founder of  Modern Beauty
Salon Holdings Ltd. , can’t sue as a beneficiary of a trust that
incurred the investment losses, according to a ruling today by
Judge Arjan Sakhrani of the Court of First Instance.  Tsang filed a $1.65 million (HK$12.8 million) claim against
Standard Chartered in December after she invested some of the 
trust’s funds in a Lehman-linked principal protected note on the
recommendation</a> of a bank employee, court documents show.  The trustee in Tsang’s claim against Standard Chartered is
Standard Chartered Trust (Cayman) Limited, which her lawyer
Edward Chan described as being “of the same group” as the bank.
The trustee declined Tsang’s request to sue the bank.  The judge agreed with Standard Chartered’s argument that
Tsang’s proper recourse is to ask a court in the Cayman Islands
to compel the trust to sue.  The case is  Tsang Yue Joyce  and Standard Chartered Bank
(Hong Kong) Ltd., Standard Chartered Trust (Cayman) Ltd.,
HCA2488/2009 in the High Court of Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
