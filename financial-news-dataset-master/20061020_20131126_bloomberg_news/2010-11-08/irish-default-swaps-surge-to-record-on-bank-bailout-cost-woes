Credit-default swaps on Ireland and
its banks surged to record high levels on concern the cost of
bailing out the nation’s financial system is unsustainable.  Contracts on Ireland soared 28 basis points from a record
closing level to 606, according to data provider CMA. Swaps on
the senior debt of  Allied Irish Banks Plc  climbed 43.5 basis
points to 899.5 and Bank of Ireland Plc increased 37.5 to 724.5.  Ireland is struggling to convince investors it can plug its  budget deficit  and repay debt as the cost of backstopping its
banks mounts. The euro weakened as the nation’s troubles
undermined confidence in the region and the yield on the Irish
10-year bond gained eight basis points to 7.91 percent.  “The uncertainty regarding sovereign debt and deficits in
the European periphery will remain a strain for risky assets,”
Tim Brunne, a Munich-based strategist at UniCredit SpA, wrote in
a note to investors.  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold Irish
10-year bonds instead of similar-maturity benchmark German debt
increased 10 basis points to 531 basis points, near the record
534 basis points reached at the end of last week.  Swaps on Allied Irish subordinated debt jumped 8 percentage
points to 54 percent upfront and five percent a year, meaning it
costs 5.4 million euros in advance and 500,000 euros annually to
insure 10 million euros of the bank’s debt for five years.
Subordinated swaps on Bank of Ireland jumped 2 percentage points
to 31 percent upfront and five percent a year.  Government Swaps  Ireland led an increase in the cost of insuring government
debt, CMA prices show. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe
Index of swaps on 15 nations rose 3.75 basis points from a
record closing level to 174.75. Contracts on Portugal jumped 9
basis points to 454,  Spain  climbed 9.5 to 259.5 and  Italy 
increased 4 to 195.  Greece  declined 3 basis points to 195.  The cost of insuring corporate bonds also rose. Contracts
on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly
high-yield credit ratings climbed 7 basis points to 438,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings increased 2 basis points to 98.75,
JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked
to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers was unchanged at
132.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  To contact the reporter on this story:
