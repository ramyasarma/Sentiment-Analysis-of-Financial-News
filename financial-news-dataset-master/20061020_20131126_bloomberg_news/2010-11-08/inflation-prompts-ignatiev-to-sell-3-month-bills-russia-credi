Russia’s central bank plans to sell
shorter-maturity debt at more frequent auctions to soak up
excess cash and curb inflation without raising borrowing costs.  Bank Rossii will offer three-month notes, known as
Obligatsii Banka Rossii, or OBRs, every two months instead of
six-month securities every quarter, it said in a Nov. 2
 statement . Demand for central bank debt due in March 2011 drove
the yield down 28 basis points to 3.64 percent at an Oct. 28
auction from 3.92 percent on Sept. 14.  The changes may help Bank Rossii Chairman  Sergey Ignatiev 
combat inflation and facilitate the government’s borrowing plan
without increasing its benchmark interest rate, according to
 Dmitry Dudkin , the head of fixed-income research at UralSib
Financial Corp. in Moscow. Unlike Brazil and China, Russia is
still trying to stimulate rather than cool economic growth.  “They don’t want to raise the refinancing rate for
political reasons, but inflation is a threat, so they want to
sterilize as much liquidity as possible with OBRs,”  Dudkin  said
in an interview yesterday.  The annual  inflation  rate reached 7.5 percent in October,
up from 7 percent in September, 6.1 percent in August and 5.5
percent in July because a drought affected crops.  Russian lenders almost tripled their OBR holdings this year
to 806.9 billion rubles ($26.2 billion) on Oct. 1 from 283.1
billion rubles at the start of the year, central bank  data  show.
Banks shifted funds into government and corporate debt as the
country’s uneven recovery from its record economic slump last
year restrained demand for bank loans from borrowers.  Planned Sales  Bank Rossii  said  it will sell 1.5 trillion rubles of the
new securities this month. The central bank aims to sell 5
billion rubles of the old securities at a Nov. 11 auction,
according to a  statement  yesterday on the Micex stock exchange.  Argentina also is using short-term central bank debt to
rein in liquidity. Argentina’s central bank stepped up its
weekly note sales this year to help remove pesos it pumps into
the monetary system as it buys dollars to build reserves and
maintain a weaker peso to buoy exports.  In Russia, First Deputy Central Bank Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  said on Oct. 5 that banks’ holdings of OBRs may rise
to 1.6 trillion rubles by the end of the year. The total amount
of outstanding central bank bonds reached about 870 billion
rubles at the start of November, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
in a Nov. 3 report.  The shift toward shorter-term debt may lead the central
bank to increase OBR yields to spur demand for the notes, which
will amount to “modest monetary tightening,” said  Pavel Pikulev , a Moscow-based fixed-income strategist in Moscow at OAO
Gazprombank, the lending arm of Russia’s gas export monopoly.  Ruble Gains  The ruble jumped 0.5 percent against the dollar, the
biggest gain in more than two weeks, to 30.6255 at the 5 p.m.
close of trading in Moscow. Non-deliverable forwards, or NDFs,
which provide a guide to expectations of currency movements and
interest rate differentials and allow companies to hedge, show
the ruble at 30.8380 per dollar in three months.  The yield on Russia’s dollar bonds due in 2020 fell 8 basis
points to 4.164 percent. The price of country’s ruble notes due
August 2016 dropped 2 basis points to 7.190 percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps rose 3.5 basis points to
139 today, down from this year’s peak of 217, according to CMA
prices. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
government or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  Default Swaps  Credit-default swaps for Russia, rated Baa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, its third-lowest investment grade rating,
cost 10 basis points more than contracts for Turkey, which is
rated four levels lower at Ba2. Russia swaps  cost  as much as 40
basis points less on April 20.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian debt
rather than U.S. Treasuries declined 2 basis point to 195, or
1.95 percentage point, according to JPMorgan EMBI+ indexes. The
difference compares with 127 for debt of similarly rated Mexico
and 174 for Brazil, which is rated two steps lower at Baa3 by
Moody’s.  The  yield   spread  on Russian bonds is 40 basis points below
the average for emerging markets, down from a 15-month high of
105 in February, according to JPMorgan indexes.  Higher yields on OBRs may spur demand for Russian assets as
investors seek to benefit from commodity prices and Russia’s
cheaper valuations compared with its peers, Pikulev at
Gazprombank said in an interview yesterday.  The outcome “could be slightly higher rates on OBRs and
higher overnight interbank rate volatility,” he said.  Good for OFZs?  Bank Rossii’s new bond may bolster demand for the
government’s domestic bonds, known as OFZs, as investors may
prefer to rotate from the low-yielding and shorter-maturity
central bank notes into OFZs, VTB Group, Russia’s second biggest
lender, said in a research note Nov. 3.  While demand for central bank notes and short-term OFZ
bonds overlaps, “this is the money market and an alternative to
short-term central bank deposits,” Deputy Finance Minister
 Dmitry Pankin  said in a telephone interview on Nov. 3. “There
wouldn’t be a significant impact.”  Russia’s central bank has sought to spur the recovery and
resisted increasing borrowing costs after 14 rate cuts. It left
its main interest rates unchanged for a fifth month on concern
the country’s economic rebound may be losing momentum.  Bank Rossii cited “weakening” consumer demand and “risks
for the stability” of the economic recovery as it opted to
maintain monetary stimulus on Oct. 29 and keep its refinancing
rate at a record-low 7.75 percent.  Relative Rates  The rate is lower than Brazil’s benchmark  Selic  overnight
rate, which policy makers increased three times this year to
10.75 percent. India’s central bank raised interest rates for a
sixth time this year on Nov. 2 in Asia’s fastest round of
increases, boosting the repurchase rate by a quarter-point to
6.25 percent and the reverse repurchase rate by a similar margin
to 5.25 percent.  The central bank’s decision to change its OBR strategy is
“important” for the market allowing Bank Rossii to exert more
control over banking sector and “sterilize excessive
liquidity” at the time when the bond market is “overheated,”
said  Alexander Ovchinnikov , vice-president at global markets at
Troika Dialog, Russia’s oldest investment bank.  “They are boosting their sales, but offering banks what is
an analogy of a deposit only more liquid,” he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
