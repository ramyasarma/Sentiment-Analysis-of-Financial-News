Venezuela’s government is raising the
price of corn flour and rice by as much as 24 percent for the
first time since March in a bid to avoid food shortages.  The government, which regulates prices of basic food goods,
raised the cap on corn flour, which is used to make the
breakfast staple arepa, by 24 percent to 3.37 bolivars ($0.78)
per kilo from 2.72, according to a resolution published today in
the Official Gazette. It also raised the cap on rice by 22
percent to 4.46 bolivars per kilo from 3.66.  The hike in food costs will likely push up consumer prices
in Venezuela, which has the highest inflation rate of 78
economies tracked by Bloomberg, after the government managed to
slow  inflation  for five consecutive months. That was achieved
because prices were officially frozen during that period, said
Boris Segura, Latin America economist at Nomura Securities
International Inc.  “The price adjustments are below accumulated inflation so
as not to add more wood to the fire,” said Segura in a
telephone interview from New York. “The government needs to
make periodic adjustments to avoid food shortages that also
provoke inflation.”  Venezuela last raised food prices by as much as 35 percent
in March on sugar, rice and chicken. Monthly inflation in April
as measured by the Caracas price index was 5.2 percent.  Inflation in Venezuela will close the year at 27 percent,
Segura said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
