India’s 12-year government  bonds  rose
on speculation the central bank will purchase existing
securities to ease a cash shortage in the financial system.  The yield on the most-traded 2022 note fell after the
 Reserve Bank of India  last week bought bonds through an open-
market auction for the first time since September 2009. The
central bank on Nov. 4 bought back 83.5 billion rupees ($1.9
billion) of debt, after offering to purchase as much as 120
billion rupees.  “Investors are optimistic the central bank will help ease
the cash crunch that we are experiencing,” said  Roy Paul ,
deputy general manager at Mumbai-based Federal Bank Ltd.  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022 fell
one basis point to 8 percent as of 9:40 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price rose
0.10, or 10 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 100.91.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive a floating
rate, climbed two basis points to 6.66 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
