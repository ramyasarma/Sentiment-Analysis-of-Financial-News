Zurich Financial Services AG ,
Switzerland’s largest insurer, said it has exercised an option
to redeem $1 billion of subordinated debt early.  Zurich will redeem two so-called enhanced capital
advantaged preferred securities, or ECAPS, valued at $600
million and $400 million and issued in December 2005 by U.S.
subsidiaries, the Zurich-based insurer said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The company said last week that third-quarter profit
dropped 22 percent after the firm settled a U.S. class action
lawsuit related to its  Farmers Group  unit.  The securities were 60-year bonds, according to the
insurer’s  website , and will be redeemed at par together with
accrued interest on Dec. 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
