Malaysian stocks rose, driving the
benchmark  index  to a record close, as government plans to boost
the economy and an appreciating currency bolstered foreign
investment in the market to a two-year high.  The benchmark  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  climbed 0.5
percent to 1,519.84 at the 5 p.m. close in Kuala Lumpur. The
measure remains below the intraday record of 1,524.69 on Jan.
14, 2008.  The Kuala Lumpur index has surged 19 percent this year,
surpassing levels before the start of the global financial
crisis in 2008 and joining Sri Lanka, Indonesia, the Philippines
and India among Asian emerging markets with benchmark stock
gauges at or near a record. Malaysia, Southeast Asia’s third-
largest  economy , grew 10.1 percent in the first quarter and 8.9
percent in the second quarter as manufacturing recovered
following last year’s recession.  “It’s hard to ignore Malaysia; its growth of above 7
percent this year is probably top quartile globally,” said
Geoffrey Ng, who manages $1 billion as chief executive officer
at HLG Asset Management Sdn. in Kuala Lumpur. “The numbers
speak for themselves; the economic fundamentals of the country
look good.”  Malaysia’s gross domestic product will grow as much as 6
percent next year after expanding 7 percent in 2010, according
to an Oct. 15 Ministry of Finance report.  IOI Corp. , Malaysia’s second-biggest palm oil producer, led
gains in Malaysia’s stock index today, buoyed by a rally in palm
oil. IOI climbed 1.9 percent to 5.97 ringgit, the highest close
since July 16, 2008. Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd. added 4.1 percent
to close at a record high of 20.62 ringgit. Sime Darby Bhd.
gained 1.1 percent to 9.03 ringgit.  ‘Super-Goldilocks’  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index  may rise to 1,500 by
end-2011, supported by the Federal Reserve’s decision to pump
$600 billion more into the financial system through so-called
quantitative easing and a “super-Goldilocks” economic
environment, Citigroup Inc.’s New York-based equity strategists
 Geoffrey Dennis  and  Jason Press  said last week. The target is 30
percent above the measure’s 1,155.94 close on Nov. 5.  The  MSCI gauge  has surged 17 percent this year, twice the
8.1 percent gain in the MSCI World Index of shares in developed
markets. Investors poured money into developing nations at a
record pace in search of higher yields amid near-zero benchmark
interest rates in the U.S.  Inflows into emerging-market stock funds have surpassed $60
billion and exceeded $46 billion in bonds, with both poised for
their best year since Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global
started tracking them in 1995.  Six Weeks  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  has climbed for six
straight weeks, the longest winning streak since April 2009.
Foreign funds bought $129 million of  Malaysian shares  in
September, after outflows of $112.4 million in August, CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. analyst  Terence Wong  said on Oct. 27,
citing EPFR, which collects data from more than 600 funds.  Overseas investment has helped boost the Malaysian ringgit
by 11 percent against the dollar this year, the second-best
performance in Asia excluding Japan.  Malaysia is “unreasonably overlooked,” Sean Darby, an
analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in a report today.
“Malaysian equities are entering a sweet spot as terms of trade
turn positive on firming commodity prices and excess liquidity
moves into financial assets.”  Darby, who turned “bullish” on Malaysian equities on Jan.
4 and recommended a switch from Indonesia to Malaysia on May 25,
said he was retaining his recommendation. His top picks include
Malayan Banking Bhd., Alliance Financial Group Bhd., Genting
Malaysia Bhd., Sime Darby, SP Setia Bhd. and UEM Land Holdings
Bhd.  Najib’s Plan  Malaysian Prime Minister  Najib Razak  said in an Oct. 15
budget speech that the government plans a 100-floor tower and a
mass rail project to boost spending and spur growth. These are
part of the $444 billion of private-led projects that the
government has identified to spur investment and transform the
country into a high-income nation.  Malaysian stocks rose after Najib’s ruling coalition won
two by-elections on Nov. 4 as promises of reforms helped to gain
voters’ support. The victories fanned speculation that a general
election will be called by the first half of 2011, Vincent Khoo,
an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Group, said in a note today. The
election must be held by 2013.  This is “sending the market higher,” he said.  Najib has sought to regain support among ethnic Chinese and
Indian voters after his National Front coalition was denied a
two-thirds majority in the March 2008 general election.  Surging Inflows  Malaysia’s stock market has also benefited from surging
inflows of global funds into emerging markets, which have
bolstered the stock indexes in neighboring Southeast Asian
nations. The benchmark index in the Philippines has jumped 41
percent this year and Thailand’s has surged 43 percent, while
Indonesia has climbed 46 percent. India’s Bombay Stock Exchange
Sensitive Index has advanced 20 percent and hit an all-time high
on Nov. 4.  “All these countries are beneficiaries of the liquidity
that’s moving into these markets,” HLG Asset Management’s Ng
said. “Risky assets are moving into growth areas in the world,
and it’s all Asian emerging markets.”  September’s fund inflows increased net purchases to $186
million so far this year, exceeding last year’s total of $158
million, said CIMB’s Wong, who was ranked the third-best analyst
in Malaysia by Institutional Investor magazine in 2010. He kept
his “overweight” rating on the market and his end-2011 index
target of 1,610 points.  Foreign Holdings  Foreigners in September increased their share of total
Malaysian equity holdings by 0.5 percentage points to 21.7
percent, the highest level since September 2008, Wong said,
citing stock exchange data.  CIMB Investment Bank raised its Malaysian stock index
target by 5.9 percent on Sept. 22, citing government efforts to
boost investment and economic growth. The benchmark  stock index 
may rise to a record 1,610 by the end of 2011, Wong said in a
report then, increasing the previous estimate of 1,520. The
end-2010 target was increased to 1,500 from 1,450.  To contact the reporter on this story:
