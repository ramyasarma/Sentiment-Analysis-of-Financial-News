             Bank of Canada Governor Mark
Carney said Greece’s debt crisis highlights the limits to
stimulus and the need for countries to start planning to rein
in deficits.  
 “What we’re seeing with Greece, and we’ve been seeing
in the last few weeks, are the indications of the limits with
fiscal stimulus,” Carney told reporters today in Washington,
on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund meetings.
“There are a number of countries that are having to take
adjustments, or will have to make adjustments, to more
sustainable fiscal paths and I think that’s an increasingly
shared realization.”  
 Group of 20 finance chiefs April 23 called for
“credible” plans to withdraw economic stimulus as the
recovery strengthens and Greece’s attempt to avert default
highlights the risks posed by mounting government debt.  
 Carney said risks to growth include potentially sharp
increases in interest rates, or greater fiscal adjustments
than anticipated that can act as a drag on growth.  
 “There are substantial fiscal consolidations that are
required in a very, very large number of countries,” Carney
said. “We’ve seen war-like spending in peacetime and it’s
going to take a concerted effort over a number of years to
bring budgets back into a sustainable level.”  
 “The worst thing to have, given the scale of fiscal
response and the size of deficits, is for a series of
countries not to have plans to bring them back to something
sustainable,” Carney said.
