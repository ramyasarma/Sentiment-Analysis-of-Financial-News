             Even after the biggest rally since
the 1930s, U.S. stocks remain the  cheapest  in two decades as the
economy improves.  
 Profit estimates for  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  companies
from  Apple Inc.  to Intel Corp. and CSX Corp. have climbed 9.3
percent on average in April, twice the gain in their prices and
the largest monthly increase since at least 2006, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The benchmark gauge for American equities is
trading at 14.1 times forecasts for its companies’ earnings,
lower than any time since 1990, except for the months after
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed.  
 Income is beating analysts’ estimates by 22 percent in the
first quarter, making investors even more bullish that the rally
will continue after the  index  climbed 79 percent since March
2009. While bears say the economy’s recovery is too weak for
earnings to keep up the momentum, Fisher Investments and
BlackRock Inc. are snapping up companies whose results are most
tied to economic expansion.  
 “The stock market is incredibly inexpensive,” said  Kevin Rendino , who manages $11 billion in Plainsboro, New Jersey, for
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. “I don’t know how
the bears can argue against how well corporations are doing.”  
 S&P 500  companies may earn $85.96 a share in the next year,
according to data from equity analysts compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with the index’s  record  combined profits of $89.93
a share from the prior 12 months in September 2007, when the S&P
500 was 20 percent higher than today.  
 Record Pace  
 The earnings upgrades come as income beats Wall Street
estimates at the fastest rate ever for the third time in four
quarters. More than  79.8 percent  of the 184 companies in the S&P
500 that reported results have topped estimates, compared with
79.5 percent in the third quarter and 72.3 percent in the three-
month period before that, Bloomberg data show.  
 The S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent to 1,212.05 today. The gauge
increased 2.1 percent last week as new-home sales  surged  the
most since 1963, recovering from the April 16 rout when the
Securities and Exchange Commission said it was suing New York-
based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for fraud. The index is up 8.7
percent for 2010, the second-largest gain in the world’s 15
biggest equity markets, behind Japan, Bloomberg data show.  
 While analysts are raising estimates, they’re not boosting
investment ratings. Companies ranked “buy” make up 30 percent
of all U.S. equities, the data show. That compares with 45
percent in September 2007, a month before the S&P 500 reached
its record high of 1,565.15 and began a 17-month plunge that
erased  $11 trillion  from the value U.S. shares.  
 Easier to Adjust  
 “It’s been easier for analysts to adjust their earnings
estimates than to aggressively put forth strong ‘buy’
recommendations,” said  Keith Wirtz , who oversees $18 billion as
chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management Inc. in
Cincinnati. “It may be a reflection of concern about the
resilience of earnings in 2011 and beyond.”  
 Companies are losing the benefit of a weaker dollar after
the currency appreciated 9.6 percent since November against a
basket of six trading partners, according to the Dollar Index
from Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange Inc. A rising
currency cuts demand for American exports and reduces overseas
revenue when converted back to dollars.  
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , the New Albany, Ohio-based teen
retailer, warned the rally may weaken its profitability,
according to a March 10 conference call. Westport, Connecticut-
based Terex Corp., the world’s third-biggest maker of
construction equipment, said in an April 21 earnings release
that currency swings may reduce revenue. Terex got 75 percent of
2009  sales  outside the U.S., Bloomberg data show.  
 Alternate Valuation  
 David Rosenberg , chief economist of Gluskin Sheff &
Associates Inc., says U.S. stocks are poised for losses because
they’ve become too  expensive . The S&P 500 is valued at 22 times
annual earnings from the past 10 years, according to inflation-
adjusted data  since  1871 tracked by Yale University Professor
 Robert Shiller .  
 Economic growth will slow and stocks retreat as governments
around the world reduce spending after supporting their
economies through the worst recession since the 1930s, said
 Komal Sri-Kumar , who helps manage more than $100 billion as
chief global strategist at TCW Group Inc. The U.S. budget
 shortfall  may reach $1.6 trillion in the fiscal year ending
Sept. 30, according to figures from the Washington-based
Treasury Department.  
 “The correction is going to come,” Sri-Kumar said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in New York on April 21.
“You now have a debt bubble growing in the sovereign side, and
we’re slow to recognize how negative that could be.”  
 Deficit Spending  
 The European Union deficit tripled to 6.3 percent of gross
domestic product last year, from 2 percent in 2008, the EU’s
Luxembourg-based statistics office said on April 22. Moody’s
Investors Service cut Greece’s credit rating the same day on
concern its debt load will be higher and more costly than
previously estimated, spurring a drop of 1.1 percent in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  
 The  S&P 500  posted a 0.2 percent gain that day after
initially falling 1.3 percent, helped by an advance in PNC
Financial Services Group Inc. The fifth-largest U.S. bank by
deposits said profit rose 28 percent on higher net interest
income and less reserves for bad loans.  
 PNC , based in Pittsburgh, is one of 38 financial services
companies in the S&P 500 reporting an average first-quarter
earnings increase of 175 percent after banks and brokerages
racked up $1.78 trillion of losses and writedowns linked to the
collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market.  
 Mobile Devices  
 Intel , the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, spurred the
S&P 500’s biggest rally in a month after reporting earnings on
April 13 that topped Wall Street estimates and predicted data
centers and the shift to mobile devices will drive growth. The
results prompted at least 20 of the 31 firms covering the Santa
Clara, California-based company to raise their 2010  forecasts .  
 Analysts lifted the average 2010 prediction by 10 percent
to $1.88 a share, Bloomberg data show. Intel trades at 12.8
times projected annual income, about half the average using
trailing profits since 1991. The shares are up 17 percent in
2010, the  Dow Jones Industrial Average’s  seventh-biggest gain.  
 Information-technology spending will climb 1.7 percent in
2010, after dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to Morgan
Stanley. Personal-computer shipments rose 27 percent last
quarter, according to Gartner Inc. The PC market bounced back
from a year earlier, when the recession dragged down shipments
almost 7 percent -- the worst performance since 2001, according
to market research firm IDC.  
 Concerns Are Past  
 “We’re in a time period where the concerns we had in 2007
and 2008 have been taken care of or are past,”  Kenneth Fisher ,
who oversees about $40 billion as chairman of Fisher Investments
in Woodside, California, said in a April 20 Bloomberg Television
interview. “If you’re waiting for a market pullback or
individual stock pullbacks, you could be waiting a long time.”  
 CSX , the third-largest U.S. railroad, rallied the most in
two months on April 14 after saying it hauled more goods and
charged more for each carload. Analysts say the Jacksonville,
Florida-based company will  earn  $3.48 a share in 2010, a 6.2
percent increase since the firm released quarterly results.  
 Profit estimates for energy producers and industrial
companies have climbed more than 10 percent in the past month,
the most among the 10 largest groups in the S&P 500, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Gross domestic product in the U.S.
is forecast to increase 3 percent this year and 2.95 percent in
2011 after contracting 2.4 percent last year, according to the
median estimates of 64 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Apple Earnings  
 Apple’s profit almost  doubled  last quarter as consumers
snapped up iPhones and Macintosh personal computers, the
Cupertino, California-based company said on April 20. The
results sent its stock up 9.5 percent to an all-time high of
$270.83 last week and boosted projections for annual income by
7.7 percent to $13 a share.  
 Apple, the third-biggest company in the U.S., with a market
value of $245.2 billion, is 30 percent  cheaper  than the average
of the past five years with a multiple of 20.7 times estimated
2010 profit, Bloomberg data show.  
 U.S. retail sales increased 1.6 percent in March, more than
anticipated and the biggest gain in four months, according to
figures from the Commerce Department issued April 14 in
Washington. Consumer spending and manufacturing helped the
economy expand across most of the U.S. in March, according to
the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book of regional economic activity
issued April 14.  
 Biggest Rally  
 The  S&P 500  rallied 92 percent in the five years after
reaching a valuation in November 1990 of 14.1 times  profit ,
about the multiple indicated by earnings forecasts for next
year, according to Bloomberg data. The index last traded that
cheaply in June 2009, near the start of the biggest rally in
seven decades and nine months after New York-based Lehman filed
the world’s biggest bankruptcy.  
 “The earnings story is very supportive of the market even
after the rally over the last year,” said  Liz Ann Sonders ,
chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab Corp., which
oversees $1.4 trillion in client assets from San Francisco.
“The recovery is real, it’s V-shaped and it’s got legs.”
