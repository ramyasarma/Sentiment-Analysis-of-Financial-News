             E.ON AG, the German energy supplier
that’s selling assets to cut debt, is still considering bids for
its U.S. utility business worth at least 4 billion euros ($5.35
billion), according to a person briefed on the matter.  
 Duke Energy Corp. is among the potential buyers for the
unit previously known as LG&E, said the person, who declined to
be identified as details of the sale are private. E.ON’s U.S.
unit supplies more than 900,000 power and 318,000 natural gas
customers through the Louisville Gas and Electric Co. and
Kentucky Utilities Co., according to the company’s Web site.  
 E.ON is about halfway through a plan to raise more than 10
billion euros in asset sales to cut borrowings amassed after the
company snapped up power plants and clients from Spain to
Siberia. Johannes Teyssen, E.ON’s chief executive officer
designate, takes charge of the company on May 1 and will set out
his plans for the utility later this year.  
 “Some resolution of the existing asset plan has to happen
if the new CEO is to sell his new strategy for the years
ahead,” said Peter Wirtz, an analyst with WestLB AG in
Dusseldorf who has a “neutral” recommendation on E.ON. “If the
deal is to close this year then they have to get it underway.”  
 Christian Drepper, a spokesman at Dusseldorf, Germany-based
E.ON, declined to comment in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg
News yesterday. Tom Williams, a spokesman at Duke, declined to
comment, citing the company’s policy not to comment on mergers
and acquisitions speculation.  
 ‘Perfect Match’  
 Jim Rogers, chief executive officer of Duke, said in an
interview this month that the owner of utilities in the U.S.
Southeast and Midwest serves an area that “matches up
perfectly” with the service territory of E.ON’s LG&E unit.  
 “You have to find cost savings, and generally the more
contiguous the companies are, probably greater the savings,”
Rogers said.  
 Duke has 135,000 electrical customers and 100,000 gas
customers in Kentucky, according to its Web site.  
 E.ON shares rose as much as 29 cents, or 1 percent, to
28.53 euros in Frankfurt today. They traded at 28.32 euros at
11:24 a.m. local time.  
 The Financial Times reported, citing Mergermarket news
service, that Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke is the
winning bidder in an auction for the assets. Duke, PPL Corp. and
a group around Macquarie Group Ltd. are in talks with E.ON over
purchasing the asset, Reuters said yesterday, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  
 E.ON has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to find a buyer for
the unit, a person briefed on the matter said last month.
