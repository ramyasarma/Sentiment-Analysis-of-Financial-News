             “How to Train Your Dragon” worked
its way back into first place at U.S. and Canadian theaters this
weekend, finishing atop the rankings with $15 million in ticket
sales for DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc.  
 “The Back-Up Plan,” a romantic comedy starring Jennifer
Lopez, opened in second place with $12.3 million for CBS Corp.’s
film division, Hollywood.com Box-Office said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement.  
 “How to Train Your Dragon,” a 3-D adventure film, debuted
as the top movie on March 28 before dropping to third place and
then inching its way into second place last weekend. Twelve of
the first 17 box-office weekends in 2010 have been topped by 3-D
films such as “Avatar” and “Alice in Wonderland,” according
to Hollywood.com.  
 “It’s unusual for a picture to come back and top the box
office,” said Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, a
research company in Sherman Oaks, California.  
 “Dragon” has made $178 million in five weeks of release.  
 In “The Back-Up Plan,” Lopez plays a woman who meets the
man of her dreams after she becomes artificially inseminated.  
 “Date Night,” a comedy starring Tina Fey and Steve
Carell, remained in third place with $10.6 million in sales for
News Corp. The film, which follows a married couple who find
themselves the target of gangsters after a case of mistaken
identity, has posted sales of $63.5 million in three weeks.  
 ‘The Losers’  
 “The Losers,” an action thriller based on a comic book,
debut in fourth place with ticket sales of $9.61 million for
Time Warner Inc.’s Warner Bros. studio. The movie features
Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Zoe Saldana and follows members of a
Special Forces unit who seek revenge following betrayal from
within their ranks.  
 “‘(The) Losers’ was never expected to be a big hit, but it
turned out to be more modest than one might have thought,” Gray
said.  
 “Kick Ass” fell to fifth place with $9.5 million in
receipts for Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. after opening in
second place last week. The movie has had sales of $34.9 million
in two weeks.  
 Sales Fall  
 Sales for the top 12 films fell 14 percent to $89.7 million
from $104.2 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Year-to-
date receipts total $3.3 billion, up 8.5 percent from a year
earlier. Attendance has increased 6.4 percent this year.  
 The following table has figures provided by studios to Los
Angeles-based Hollywood.com. The amounts are based on actual
ticket sales from April 23 and April 24 and estimates for
yesterday.
