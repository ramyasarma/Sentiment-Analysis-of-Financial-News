Bolivian Mining Minister Mario
Virreira said the government intends to revoke a lease granted
to Glencore International AG to operate a tin and zinc mine in
the southwest of the country, state information agency ABI said.  State mining company Comibol, which owns the mine, will
become the operator of the asset along with workers cooperatives
pending community approval, ABI said. The lease is operated by
Glencore unit Sinchi Wayra.  Morales nationalized Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore’s
Huanuni tin smelter in 2007 and an antimony smelter in 2010 in a
series of expropriations since he came to power in 2006 that
have included natural gas wells held by Repsol YPF SA and Total
SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
