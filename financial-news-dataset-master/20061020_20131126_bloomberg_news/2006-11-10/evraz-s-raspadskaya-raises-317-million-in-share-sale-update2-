             OAO Raspadskaya, among the world's
10 biggest coking-coal producers, raised $317 million in a share
sale as Russian stock offerings this year climb to a record.  
 Raspadskaya sold 140.8 million shares, or 18 percent of its
stock, at $2.25 apiece, valuing the company at $1.76 billion,
according to an e-mailed statement received today. Credit Suisse
Group, Deutsche UFG and Morgan Stanley managed the transaction.  
 Appetite for Russian share offerings may be waning after
more than $16.5 billion of sales this year, 50 percent more than
in the previous five years combined. Raspadskaya, 50 percent
owned by Russia's biggest steelmaker, Evraz Group, in which
billionaire  Roman Abramovich  has a 40 percent stake, was valued
by the sale arrangers at between $1.6 and $2.2 billion.  
 ``It was expensive because it's not diversified and we
expect coking coal prices to fall,'' Kyrill Chuiko, a metals
analyst at UralSib in Moscow, said in a telephone interview.
``They obviously convinced investors their profits will rise
because it was a successful sale.''  
 Prices for Russian coking coal, which rose to an all-time
high of $80 a metric ton in 2005, may drop as much as 19 percent
to an average $60 a ton this year and another 10 percent in 2007,
according to Chuiko.  
 Shares of Raspadskaya began trading on Moscow's Russian
Trading System at noon local time and had fallen 5.3 percent to
$2.13 by 4:32 p.m. local time. They are listed solely on the
Russian exchange, the first time a major company from the country
has chosen not to list shares abroad.  
 Offerings Soar  
 Russian share offerings have soared after a six-year stock
market rally. OAO Severstal, the nation's biggest steelmaker,
sold $1.06 billion of stock two days ago. OAO Rosneft,  Russia 's
state oil company, raised $10.4 billion on July 14 in  Europe 's
biggest initial public offering in seven years. Raspadskaya's is
the first by a Russian coal miner.  
 Raspadskaya, based in the west Siberian region of Kemerovo,
plans to mine 10.4 million tons of coking coal next year, rising
to 17 million tons by 2010, according to Credit Suisse. The
coalminer's audited reserves are enough to last 72 years at
current output levels, the bank said, citing the Australasian
Joint Ore Reserves Commission, or JORC.  
 Net income rose 30 percent to $166 million last year on
sales of $541 million. More than 95 percent of Raspadskaya is
owned by Corber Enterprises Ltd., in which Evraz and Raspadskaya
management each own 50 percent.  
 Extracting coal costs Raspadskaya about $19 a ton, according
to Deutsche Bank AG, about a third cheaper than the Russian
industry average.
