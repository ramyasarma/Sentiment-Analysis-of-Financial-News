             Remgro Ltd. (REM) , a South African holding
company for banking, tobacco and mining interests, said first-half
profit dropped 42 percent after last year's gains on the sale of
stakes weren't repeated.  
 Net income fell to 3.14 billion rand ($440 million), or 6.40
rand a share, in the six months through September, Stellenbosch,
South Africa-based Remgro said today in a stock-exchange statement.
That's down from a restated 5.44 billion rand, or 11.11 rand a
share, a year earlier. Last year's earnings aren't comparable
because of accounting changes, it added.  
 The company last year sold its 9 percent stake in Absa Group
Ltd. to Barclays Plc, the U.K.'s third-biggest bank. It also sold
its 17.9 percent interest in Sage Group Ltd. to life insurer
Momentum Group Ltd. Remgro made a first-half profit of 6 million
rand by selling stakes in its investments compared with a profit a
year ago of 3.04 billion rand.  
 Net income declined ``mainly as a result of  capital gains 
arising on the realization of investments accounted for during the
comparative period,'' Remgro said.  
 Remgro owns a stake in  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) , the
world's second-biggest tobacco producer. It also owns stakes in
 FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , South Africa's second-largest financial services
company, and Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., the world's No. 2
platinum producer.  
 Currency Boost  
 Shares of Remgro gained 1.01 rand, or 0.6 percent, to close at
159.20 rand, giving the company a market value of 77.1 billion
rand. The earnings were released after trading closed.  
 Earnings adjusted for one-time items and accounting charges
rose 19 percent to 3.2 billion rand, or 6.60 rand a share, from 2.7
billion rand, or 5.44 rand, a year earlier, the company said.  
 A drop in the rand against the British pound boosted income
Remgro makes from its interest in British American Tobacco, helping
lift profit before one-time items from its tobacco interests to
1.48 billion rand from 1.26 billion rand, it added.  
 Earnings before one-time items from its industrial interests
rose 45 percent to 729 million rand, boosted by its 41 percent
stake in Unilever Bestfoods Robertsons LLC and 24.9 percent holding
Total  South Africa  Ltd., the local unit of Total SA.
