             Telefonos de Mexico SA , the country's
biggest fixed-line telephone company, said second-quarter profit
rose 16 percent after it was reimbursed for taxes paid on a
profit-sharing program.  
 Net income  increased to 8.04 billion pesos ($748 million),
or 41 centavos a share, from an inflation-adjusted 6.9 billion
pesos, or 33 centavos, a year earlier, the Mexico City-based
company said today in an e-mail. Sales rose 1.9 percent to 45.7
billion pesos.  
 Earnings before interest, tax, amortization and depreciation
fell 1.7 percent to 18.8 billion pesos, as it disconnected fixed
telephone lines in Mexico and increased spending more than three-
fold in  Colombia  to integrate cable television assets with other
operations in the country.  
 ``These aren't very good results,'' said Martin Lara, a
telecommunications analyst with brokerage Vector Casa de Bolsa SA
in  Mexico  City. Lara, who rates the stock ``hold'' and doesn't
own it, expected net income of 8.4 billion pesos. ``There's no
growth in Mexico.''  
 Telmex had nonrecurring revenue of 1.48 billion pesos after
a court ordered the government to reimburse the company for taxes
paid on a profit-sharing program in 2004 and 2005.  
 The number of fixed-line telephones in Mexico fell to
18.2 million from 18.6 million a year earlier, as customers
switched to mobile phones and the Internet. Telmex, which gets
some 90 percent of its operating profit from Mexico, disconnected
82,000 lines in the second quarter, mostly pre-paid telephones.  
 Mexico, Brazil  
 Revenue in Mexico rose 1.6 percent to 32.3 billion pesos as
sales of Internet services and fees to connect fixed-lines with
mobile phones increased. The gain helped offset a drop in sales
of local and long-distance telephone services, the company said.  
 In  Brazil , the company's second-biggest market, revenue rose
3 percent to 3 billion reais because of increased sales of
Internet and telephone services to residential customers.  
 Shares of Telmex rose 33 centavos, or 1.67 percent, to close
at 20.08 pesos in Mexico City trading and have gained 31 percent
this year. The company released results after markets closed.  
 Telmex had a profit of 75 cents per U.S. traded share.
