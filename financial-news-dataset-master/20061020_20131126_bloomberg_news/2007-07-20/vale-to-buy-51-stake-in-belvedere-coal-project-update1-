             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce, the world's
largest iron ore exporter, will buy 51 percent of the Belvedere
coking coal venture in  Australia  for $90 million, increasing the
amount of steelmaking raw materials it's able to sell.  
 Vale will pay $45 million each to  Aquila Resources Ltd. (AQA)  and
American Metals and Coal Industries for its stake, Perth-based
Aquila said in a statement. Vale also has the right to buy the
rest of the project, Aquila said.  
 The price of coking coal may jump 10 percent next year,
Citigroup Inc. said in June, as mining companies can't meet
rising demand from steelmakers. Vale bought AMCI's Australian
unit for A$835 million ($736 million) in February as part of a
plan to expand.  
 The Belvedere project could produce 8 million to 9 million
metric tons a year of coking and pulverized coal, a cheaper form
of coal also used in steelmaking.
