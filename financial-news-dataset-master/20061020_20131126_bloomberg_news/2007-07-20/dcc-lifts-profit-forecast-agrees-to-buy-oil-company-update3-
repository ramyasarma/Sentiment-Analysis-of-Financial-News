             DCC Plc (DCC) , an Irish distributor of
goods from liquefied petroleum gas to computer software, raised
its operating profit forecast after a ``satisfactory'' first
quarter and announced the acquisition of a U.K. oil distributor.  
 The Dublin-based company expects ``low double-digit'' growth
in operating profit for the year through next March, according to
a statement released today before its annual general meeting. That
compares with a May forecast for ``high single-digit'' growth.  
 DCC agreed to buy  CPL Petroleum Ltd.  for 74.2 million euros
($102 million). The acquisition is part of the company's plan to
double the size of its oil business in Britain, and will contribute
to profit during the second half of the year. Chief Executive
Officer Jim Flavin, who founded DCC 30 years ago, has boosted sales
by buying businesses such as U.K. fuel distributor Carlton Fuels.  
 ``This is DCC's largest acquisition to date and is a welcome
move,'' John Sheehan, an analyst at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin,
said in a research note. The increased profit guidance and the
prospect of further acquisitions ``underpin the stock,'' said
Sheehan, who gives the shares an ``accumulate'' rating.  
 Shares of DCC rose as much as 89 cents, or 3.8 percent, to
24.05 euros in Dublin and were up 2.5 percent at 23.74 euros at
1:12 p.m. local time. The gain reduced the stock's drop in 2007
to 7.8 percent. It more than doubled in the prior four years.  
 `Considerable Synergies'  
 ``DCC's operating profit growth in its first quarter to June
30 was satisfactory,'' the company said. Results from the
software, health-care, food and environmental units were ``in
line with budget,'' according to the statement.  
 CPL Petroleum had operating profit before one-time costs
and goodwill of 9.4 million euros in the year through March. DCC
said it expects to complete the purchase by the end of
September. It's purchasing the business from Chesterfield,
England-based CPL Industries Holdings Ltd.  
 ``There are considerable synergies, we believe, to be
achieved over time by integrating it with our existing oil
operations,'' Flavin told shareholders at the meeting. DCC is
``very actively'' searching for acquisitions, the CEO told
journalists after the meeting, without giving further details.  
 The Irish company in February put its 49 percent stake in
Manor Park Homebuilders Ltd. up for sale. The sale process is
``ongoing,'' DCC said today.
