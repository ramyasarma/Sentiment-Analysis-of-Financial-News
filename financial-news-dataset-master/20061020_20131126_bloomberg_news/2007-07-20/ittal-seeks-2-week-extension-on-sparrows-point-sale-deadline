             Arcelor Mittal (MT) , the world's biggest
steelmaker, asked the U.S. government for a two-week extension
of the deadline to sell its Sparrows Point steel mill, after
failing to conclude talks with a buyer.  
 Mittal sought an extension through Aug. 6 to sell the
plant, which is located near Baltimore, spokesman Bill Steers
said today in an e-mailed statement. The  U.S. Department of
Justice  ``does not oppose'' the motion, Steers said.  
 Luxembourg-based Mittal must sell the plant to win U.S.
antitrust approval for Mittal Steel Co.'s $35.9 billion purchase
of Arcelor SA. Mittal hasn't identified any bidders for the
mill. The previous deadline for arranging the sale was today.  
 Esmark Inc., a closely held U.S.-based steel distributor,
and  Brazil 's Cia. Siderurgica Nacional have said they are
interested in the mill. Mittal chose a short list of buyers in
March.
