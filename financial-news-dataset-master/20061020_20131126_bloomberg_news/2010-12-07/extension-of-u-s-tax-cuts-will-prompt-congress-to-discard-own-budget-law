Congressional Democrats and
Republicans are preparing to set aside their budget constraints
as they negotiate the extension of income tax cuts scheduled to
expire this month.  Their plans to declare a budget emergency as they approve
the extension of tax cuts will override a “pay-as-you-go” law
that was structured to limit Congress’s ability to finance
higher spending or tax relief by expanding the budget deficit.  Extending all income-tax rates for two years, along with
renewal of business tax breaks, relief from the alternative
minimum tax and other moves such as expanded  unemployment 
insurance could add about $750 billion to the deficit over the
next decade, about $300 billion of which is beyond the deficit-
expansion which the “pay-as-you-go” law would allow.  For all the campaign-trail rhetoric about deficit reduction
and recent attention focused on a bipartisan fiscal commission,
Republicans and Democrats alike say the so-called “paygo” law
won’t be a procedural or political obstacle to extending all of
the tax cuts without offsets in spending.  “I never think paygo is out the window, in my own personal
view,” said Representative  Baron Hill  of Indiana, who lost his
bid for re-election last month. “But any rate, that’s what’s
going to happen.” Hill co-chairs the Blue Dog Coalition, a
group of House Democrats that pushed for the law.  Required Offsets  The paygo law, signed by President  Barack Obama  on Feb. 12,
generally requires that tax cuts or increases in mandatory
spending be offset by spending reductions or revenue-raising
measures. The law allows Congress to exempt about $1.5 trillion
if needed to extend many of the Bush-era tax cuts.  Offsets aren’t needed to make the income tax cuts permanent
on the first $200,000 of gross income for individuals or the
first $250,000 for married couples. Offsets also aren’t needed
to prevent the expansion of the alternative minimum tax through
2011 or to extend the 2009 parameters of the estate tax (a $3.5
million per-person exemption and a 45 percent top rate) through
2011.  If, over the course of a year, Congress creates additional
deficits under the law’s parameters, its enforcement mechanism
triggers automatic spending cuts in mandatory programs such as
most Medicare payments, farm price supports and social service
block grants.  The law’s demand for offsets led Democrats to propose
measures that were opposed by businesses, including higher per-
barrel taxes on oil production and limits on several kinds of
foreign tax-credit transactions.  Emergency Declarations  Still, emergency declarations can be used to exempt
particular bills from the law’s enforcement rules.  Congress used such declarations this year to pass
unemployment-insurance extensions without offsets. Democratic
attempts to extend expired tax breaks failed because they were
paired with revenue-raising offsets, such as higher taxes on the
“carried interest” earned by private equity managers and real
estate investors.  “That paygo law is just used to increase taxes,” said
Senator  Orrin Hatch  of Utah, who is in line to become the top
Republican on the Finance Committee next year. “It doesn’t make
a hill of beans what the difference is as far as cutting back on
spending and the overregulation that these Democrats have
brought to this country.”  Spending Side  The law also has affected the spending side of the budget.
The health-care overhaul, for example, increased spending on
insurance for low-income people, and Democrats made it compliant
with the paygo law, in part, by reducing future Medicare costs.  Historically, budget constraints have worked when they
embodied an agreement about how to address fiscal policy, said
 James Horney , director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities. Without that agreement, he said,
the pay-as-you-go law is likely to be ignored or waived in the
year-end tax bill.  “It’s more of a symptom of the lack of consensus about
what to do on budgets and deficits,” Horney said.  The tax bill that the House passed Dec. 2 complied with the
pay-as-you-go law, because it didn’t extend tax cuts on income
above the specified thresholds. Senate Republicans have pledged
to block that bill because they think tax cuts should be
extended for taxpayers at every income level.  The main Senate Democratic alternative proposed by Finance
Chairman  Max Baucus  on Dec. 2 features dozens of provisions that
violate the pay-as-you-go law. They include a permanent
extension of the 2009 estate tax parameters, extension of the
“Making Work Pay” tax credit approved by President  Barack Obama  from the stimulus law and the extension of dozens of
provisions favored by businesses such as a research tax credit.  Republicans voted unanimously against the pay-as-you-go law
earlier this year, and they dismiss it as a Democratic gimmick.  Changes Sought  Republicans, who will control the House in January, can’t
eliminate or change the law without agreement from the Senate
and Obama. They are weighing changes to the separate pay-as-you-
go rules that the House has adopted, said Representative  Greg Walden  of Oregon, who is leading the Republican transition team.  Republicans complain that the law doesn’t apply to
discretionary spending, the main funding vehicle for federal
agencies. They also say it ignores the positive economic effects
of tax cuts.  “The thing about paygo is it was specifically designed by
the Democrats to encourage spending and discourage tax
reductions,” said  John Campbell , a California Republican who
sits on the House Budget Committee. “We hate it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:  Richard Rubin  in
