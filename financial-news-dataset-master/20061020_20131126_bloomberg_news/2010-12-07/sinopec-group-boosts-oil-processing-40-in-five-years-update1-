China Petrochemical Corp. said it
increased oil processing volume by 40 percent in the past five
years, becoming the world’s second-largest refiner as the
nation’s fuel demand surges.  Oil processing at its refineries rose to an estimated 208
million metric tons this year (4.2 million barrels a day) from
149 million tons in 2005, China Petrochemical, or Sinopec Group,
said in a  statement  in a company newsletter today. Annual
capacity will climb to 228 million tons by the end of this year,
 Huang Wensheng , a company spokesman, said by telephone from
Beijing today.  The state refiner added 70.8 million tons of annual
refining capacity over the past five years, or a yearly increase
of 7.1 percent. That is more than double the pace of the
preceding five years, it said.  Sinopec Group, the parent of  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp (600028) , spent more than 17.4 billion  yuan  ($2.6 billion) from 2005
to 2009 building new refining units or upgrading existing
facilities to improve fuel quality, it said in the statement.  The company’s crude output may increase to 42.6 million
tons this year, up 8 percent from 2005, and natural gas
production may almost double to 12.2 billion cubic meters,
Sinopec Group said in a  statement  on its website dated
yesterday.  The company added 1.3 billion tons of proven crude reserves
and 658.7 billion cubic meters of gas reserves over the past
five years, it said.  Exxon Mobil Corp., the world’s largest refiner, has
distillation capacity of 6.3 million barrels a day, according to
its  website . Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s operable crude distillation
capacity was 3.64 million barrels a day at the end of 2009,
according to its  annual report . It said in March that it plans
to reduce capacity by 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
