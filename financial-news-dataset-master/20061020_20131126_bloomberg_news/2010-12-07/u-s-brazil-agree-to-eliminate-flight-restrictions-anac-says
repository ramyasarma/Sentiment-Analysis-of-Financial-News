The U.S. and Brazil agreed to end
restrictions on flights between the two countries in 2015.  The countries plan to gradually lift a limit of 154 flights
a week and will allow routes between any U.S. and Brazilian
cities,  Bruno Dalcolmo , head of international relations at
Brazil’s national aviation agency,  Anac , said in a telephone
interview from Brasilia yesterday.  A preliminary agreement has been reached between
negotiators for the two governments, while a formal accord still
needs to be made, he said.  More supply, combined with a strong local currency, should
reduce the average ticket prices, Dalcolmo said. For the routes
between Brazil and Europe, which don’t face the same
restrictions, the average tickets are priced 30 percent lower
than those for routes to North America, he said.  If the Brazilian real continues to strengthen against the
American dollar, which is what makes tickets less expensive for
local consumers, “the air traffic between Brazil and the United
States will also continue to grow,” Dalcolmo said.  The real rose 33 percent against the U.S. dollar last year,
the biggest gain among the world’s major currencies. This year,
it is up 4 percent, at 1.6785 per dollar.  The U.S. and Brazil may start an additional 28 routes next
year and 28 more in 2012, Dalcolmo said. Another 49 flights
might be created in 2013, with the same increase in 2014 before
the restrictions are eliminated in 2015, he said.  First Destination  The number of flights between the two countries advanced by
15 percent from last year, according to Anac. The U.S. is the
first destination for Brazilian travelers, with 2.76 million
journeying there last year, the  agency’s 2009 data  show. The
second-most popular destination is neighboring Argentina, with 2
million travelers.  American Airlines Inc.  has the largest market share -- a
32.5 percent stake, while  Tam SA  has 30 percent, according to
Anac’s 2009 data.  Sao Paulo’s Guarulhos international airport, the country’s
largest, won’t be able to start new flights until 2013 because
of capacity limitations, Anac said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
