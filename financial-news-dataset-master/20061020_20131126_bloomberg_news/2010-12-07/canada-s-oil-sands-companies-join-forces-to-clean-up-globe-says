Canada’s biggest oil sands companies
are collaborating to clean up the lakes of toxic effluent they
leave behind them, the Globe & Mail reported, citing an
interview with Steve Laut, the president of Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd.  Rather than try to sell or license their intellectual
property, the companies will share it with one another.  Lakes of effluent cover 170 square kilometers of
northeastern Alberta; they’re an eyesore and a danger to
wildlife, the Globe & Mail said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
