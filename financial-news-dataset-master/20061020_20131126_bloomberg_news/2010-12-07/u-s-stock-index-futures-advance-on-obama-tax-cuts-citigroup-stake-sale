U.S. stocks erased gains in the final
hour of trading, pulling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down
from a two-year high, after a probe of insider trading
reportedly widened and President  Barack Obama  said he’ll push to
overhaul the tax code in two years.   3M Co. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Hewlett-Packard Co. lost
at least 1.5 percent for the biggest declines in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average as the 30-stock gauge erased an 89-point
rally.  Citigroup Inc.  gained 3.8 percent after the Treasury sold
its remaining stake.  New York Times Co.  added 4.1 percent after
forecasting print-ad revenue improvement.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent to 1,223.75 at 4 p.m. in New
York after surging 1 percent earlier. The Dow lost 3.03 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 11,359.16.  “It all happened at the same time, taking the market off
its highs,” said  Michael Nasto , senior trader at U.S. Global
Investors Inc., which manages about $2.5 billion in San Antonio.
“Investors got a little spooked during Obama’s press
conference,” he said. “Then, we had news that the SEC may widen
the insider trading probe. That took some wind out of stocks.”  The S&P 500 traded for about 1,233.50 at 2:40 p.m. before
falling after Obama said he will fight to let the tax cuts for
the wealthiest taxpayers expire in two years. Obama defended the
deal he struck with Republicans to temporarily extend Bush-era
tax cuts as necessary to spare middle-income Americans a tax
increase and to spur job creation.  Insider Trading  Equities also slumped at the end of the day after Reuters
said U.S. authorities widened their investigation of insider
trading on Wall Street, issuing subpoenas to “several large
hedge funds” it didn’t identify. Reuters cited people familiar
with the investigation that it didn’t name.  The stock market’s gains earlier in the day were driven by
Obama’s agreement to extend tax cuts and the Treasury’s sale of
$10.5 billion in  Citigroup  stock, which brought the country’s
third-biggest bank a step closer to independence from the
government following a $45 billion bailout in 2008.  “The announcement of a compromise on taxes is a net
positive and takes off the table a great degree of
uncertainty,” said  Kevin Caron , a market strategist in Florham
Park, New Jersey, at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which oversees about
$90 billion in client assets. “The U.S. government wants to
rehab companies and then exit its role as an investor, as
happened with Citigroup and General Motors. Stocks certainly
have room to move higher.”  Scotch Tape  3M  fell the most in the Dow, dropping 3.1 percent to
$84.19. The maker of Scotch tape and optical films forecast
earnings of $6.10 a share at most in 2011, including pension
costs. Analysts, on average, estimated $6.20 a share, according
to a Bloomberg survey.  Talbots Inc.  had the biggest decline in the Russell 2000
Index, plunging 23 percent to $8.81. The women’s clothing
retailer cut its forecast for earnings this year to no more than
78 cents a share, below a previous estimate of as much as 92
cents a share.  Banks had the biggest decline in the S&P 500 among 24
industries.  KeyCorp  slumped 2.8 percent to $7.95, while Comerica
Inc. dropped 1.7 percent to $38.76.  Citigroup  gained 3.8 percent to $4.62. The Treasury still
owns warrants on 465.1 million Citigroup shares, and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. holds $800 million of the bank’s trust-
preferred securities on behalf of the Treasury.  New York Times  increased 4.1 percent to $9.76 after saying
it expects fourth-quarter print advertising to improve from the
third quarter. The company said it sees a decline of about 4
percent year-over-year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
