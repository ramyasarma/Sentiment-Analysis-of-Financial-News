Public transport in Athens and train
services across Greece will be paralyzed tomorrow as workers
protest against cuts in wages and bonuses and reorganization of
state-controlled companies.  The 24-hour strike by state transportation workers takes
place between visits by  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, who is in Athens
today, and European Union Economic Monetary Commissioner  Olli Rehn , who arrives in the capital Dec. 9.  Strauss-Kahn and Rehn are likely to discuss the state-
company restructuring, wage and bonus cuts and the transfer of
employees to other positions. The changes to state enterprises
are among conditions imposed by the EU and the IMF in exchange
for a 110 billion-euro ($148 billion) bailout of the country in
May.  The  Greek Civil Servants Confederation , or ADEDY, Greece’s
largest public-sector union, will hold a rally in Athens today
to coincide with Strauss-Kahn’s visit. Communist trade union
PAME will also hold a protest before marching to parliament.  On Dec. 15, ADEDY and the  General Confederation of Labor ,
the country’s largest private-sector union, will hold a 24-hour
general strike against austerity measures in the 2011 budget,
including public-sector cuts and the loosening of labor laws for
private companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
