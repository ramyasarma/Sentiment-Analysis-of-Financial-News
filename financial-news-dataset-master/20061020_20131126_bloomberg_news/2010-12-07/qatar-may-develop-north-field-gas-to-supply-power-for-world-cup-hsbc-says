Qatar may have to lift a moratorium
on developing the world’s largest natural-gas reservoir, known
as the North Field, to generate enough electricity to stage the
2022 World Cup soccer championship,  HSBC Holdings Plc  said.  “There are likely to be increased power needs due to the
influx of labor and later air-conditioning requirement for the
new hotels,” HSBC analysts Raj Sinha and John Lomax said in a
report dated Dec. 3.  The Persian Gulf sheikhdom, holder of the world’s third-
largest gas reserves, bested the U.S., Japan, South Korea and
Australia to play host to the world’s most-watched sporting
event.  Qatar needs gas to supply its power plants and has been
studying the viability of exploiting the North Field since
halting development there in 2005. Saad al-Kaabi, director of
oil and gas ventures at state-owned Qatar Petroleum, said last
year the moratorium wouldn’t be lifted before 2014, if at all.  “Bringing forward capacity additions could encourage the
moratorium on gas exploration to be lifted, as additional
feedstock is required,” HSBC said.  The North Field contains reserves of about 900 trillion
cubic feet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
