Nomura Holdings Inc. , Japan’s biggest
brokerage, cut its recurring profit forecast for the nation’s
companies for this fiscal year and the next because of the yen’s
appreciation.  Nomura lowered its earnings-growth projections for
companies excluding financial firms on the  Nomura 400 stock
index  to 13.3 percent for fiscal 2011, down from its September
estimate of 19.8 percent, the brokerage said in a report dated
yesterday. For 2010, it lowered the outlook by 1.3 percentage
points to 56.2 percent growth in recurring profit. The strong
yen versus the dollar this year is likely to be a major
impairment to company earnings,  Takashi Ito , a strategist at
Tokyo-based Nomura, wrote in the report.  The yen’s surge to a 15-year high against the dollar
contributed to the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average ’s 3.8 percent
decline this year, as it damped the profit outlook for the
nation’s exporters. The stronger yen reduces income at Japanese
companies when overseas revenue is converted into local currency.  “When you consider the implications of their business
performance on stock prices, shares will probably rise very very
slowly until March,”  Masanobu Kaizu , Chief Research Officer at
Nomura’s Financial and Economic Research Center, said at a
conference today. “From April to September, stocks may rise
considerably as they reflect the improved earnings for the
second half of 2011.”  Nomura estimates that recurring profit for the first half
of 2011 will fall 2.9 percent before jumping 33.8 percent in the
second half of the same year for the 353 non-financial companies
in the 400 stock index, according to the report. Recurring
profit rose 142.9 percent in the first half of this year, and
will gain 7.6 percent in the second half of fiscal 2010, Nomura
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
