Bank of Montreal  Chief Executive
Officer  William Downe  said he’s in no rush to raise dividends at
Canada’s fourth-biggest bank.  “It’s all dependent upon our earnings,”  Downe , 58, said
today in an interview. “We’re committed to increase dividends
over time, but I don’t think we’re in a rush.”  Bank of Montreal kept its dividend unchanged at 70 cents
for 14 quarters. The Toronto-based bank has a  dividend  payout
target of 45 percent to 55 percent of earnings. Bank of
Montreal’s dividend payout was equal to 56 percent of profit in
the fourth quarter.  National Bank of Canada and Canadian Western Bank announced
dividend increases within the past two weeks, the first jump
among the country’s lenders since Laurentian Bank of Canada
announced a dividend increase in December 2009.  Downe also said he expects takeover opportunities to emerge
in the next year as U.S. banks consolidate. Downe said he’d
consider takeovers but he doesn’t want to divert attention to
those unrelated to Bank of Montreal’s areas of expertise.  “We just have to focus on the Midwest of the U.S. with
respect to personal and commercial banking, and wealth
management on a North American basis,” Downe said.  Bank of Montreal also increased its medium-term financial
 performance  objective to 12 percent annual growth in earnings
per share, up from 10 percent, on an expectation that markets
will improve in a business-led economic recovery.  “The headwinds have abated,” Downe said. “We’re going to
see stronger economic growth in the next two or three years than
we’ve seen in the previous two and three years.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
