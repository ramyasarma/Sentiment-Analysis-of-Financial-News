Google Inc.  started a service aimed
at businesses that sell their products internationally, as the
owner of the world’s most popular search engine seeks to boost
advertising sales linked to online commerce.  The Google Ads for Global Advertisers site will offer
functions including translation and software that help companies
find customers in international markets, Google said today in an
e-mailed statement.  The tool follows the introduction of services this year to
make it easier for small businesses to advertise on Google’s
site. The Mountain View, California-based company is also
increasing sales from display ads to diversify from its main
business of paid-search advertising.  The program will be available in 43 languages, Google said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
