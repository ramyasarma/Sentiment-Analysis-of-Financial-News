The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ’s
rally today helped reverse 61.8 percent of its plunge from
October 2007 to March 2009, a positive signal to analysts who
study price and volume chart patterns.  The benchmark index for American equities rose as much as 1
percent to 1,235.05 earlier, its highest level since Sept. 22,
2008, after President Barack Obama agreed to extend tax cuts and
the U.S. Treasury Department sold its remaining stake in
Citigroup Inc. Gains in April and November  stalled  before the
index crossed 1,228.74, the 61.8 percent retracement level.  The threshold is part of Fibonacci chart analysis, which
attempts to identify points where advances may gain momentum or
falter. The difference between high and low points is divided
into stages using levels such as 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent and
61.8 percent.  “If you can get above it and hold above it, it builds
confidence, and it sets you up for eventually attacking the next
resistance level,” said  John Schlitz , the New York-based chief
U.S. market technician at Instinet Group Inc., which handles
about 4 percent of daily U.S. stock trading.  The Fibonacci ratios identified by 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa correspond to proportions found
in nature. In technical analysis, a stock that has recouped 61.8
percent of a decline is viewed as more likely to recover
completely.  Resistance  “Overbought” conditions in the U.S. stock market may need
to subside further before the S&P 500 reaches its next major
resistance level at about 1,313, Schlitz said. That level is
where a rebound stalled in August 2008 before the index began
the steepest part of its descent, he said.  “Every major index is coming into today with a stochastic
above 90,” Schlitz said, referring to a system of measuring
prices relative to a recent range on a scale of 1 to 100. “I
don’t think people are going to go too crazy just because we get
a couple of closes above the 61.8.”  The S&P 500 reached a record 1,576.09 during Oct. 11, 2007.
It tumbled to an intraday low of 666.79 on March 6, 2009, as
bank losses stemming from the collapse of the U.S. subprime
mortgage market caused a global recession. The index has gained
more than 4 percent in the past week amid signs the economy is
responding to fiscal and monetary stimulus.  “It’s a bullish development, and something that has to
happen if we’re going to continue to see the market moving
higher,” Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, a Birmingham, Alabama-based
senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management, said of the
advance. “It’s a technical resistance point, and it seems to be
overridden by the fact that monetary policy and now the tax-cut
extension could produce better GDP growth.” BB&T oversees $17
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
