The pound rose against the dollar as
reports on manufacturing and consumer spending added to evidence
the U.K. economic recovery is picking up, boosting demand for
British assets amid Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Sterling climbed to its strongest level in almost two weeks
against the dollar. Sales at stores open at least 12 months
climbed 0.7 percent in November from a year earlier, adding to a
0.8 percent gain in October, the  British Retail Consortium  said.
Manufacturing output rose in October by twice as much as
economists predicted, a report showed today. Gilts fell as
stocks advanced and as the government sold 2 billion pounds
($3.16 billion) of bonds due in 2049.  “U.K. data has been solid relative to expectations,”
helping to support the pound, said  Neil Jones , head of European
hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London.
“Sterling is a currency that relates very well to data.”  The pound gained 0.6 percent to $1.5816 at 4:10 p.m. in
London, paring the decline against its U.S. peer since the end
of 2009 to 2.1 percent. Sterling earlier traded at its strongest
level since Nov. 24 versus the dollar. It was 0.4 percent
stronger at 84.36 pence per euro.  Declines in gilts pushed the 10-year yield up five basis
points to 3.44 percent. The two-year  yield  also rose two basis
points, to 1.02 percent while that on the 4.25 percent security
maturing in December 2049 increased for a fifth day, rising
three basis points to 4.36 percent.  Stocks Rise  The FTSE 100 stock index climbed as much as 1.3 percent to
the highest in almost a month. The MSCI World Index of stocks
climbed 0.7 percent, gaining for a fourth day out of five.  The 0.6 percent growth pace in manufacturing in October was
up from 0.1 percent in September, and beat the 0.3 percent
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 23 economists.  Britain’s currency has gained 0.5 percent in the past
month, compared with a 2.6 percent decline by the euro,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes,
which track the performance of a basket of 10 peers. Gilts lost
1.2 percent this month, cutting their gain this year to 6.5
percent, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Sterling is benefiting and gilts losing favor as investors
bet that signs the economic recovery is picking up steam as
inflation remains above target will make it less likely the Bank
of England will boost its 200 billion-pound bond-purchase
program, known as quantitative easing. Investors have dubbed
prospects for a second round of such easing “QE2.”  Policy makers will keep their benchmark lending rate at 0.5
percent in two days’ time, according to all 58 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Breakeven Rate  “The door to QE2 has not been closed in the U.K., but
implementation will depend on clear evidence of economic
slowdown in 2011 and confidence from the Monetary Policy
Committee that higher inflation is not dislodging inflation
expectations,”  Kenneth Broux , a senior market economist at
Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London, wrote in an e-mailed note
today.  The 10-year breakeven rate, a measure of inflation
expectations, was at 2.92 percentage points today, from 2.89
percentage points yesterday. The rate has rebounded from 2.476
on Aug. 31, the lowest level this year. Consumer prices
increased 3.2 percent in October, forcing Bank of England
Governor  Mervyn King  to write a letter to Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  explaining why the 3 percent upper
limit was breached.  Today’s bond sale attracted bids equivalent to 1.82 times
the amount on offer, up from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of
1.81 times at a sale in January, Debt Management Office data
showed. A sale of the securities in June 2009 was oversubscribed
by 2.30 times.  The U.K. will sell 3.5 billion pounds of bonds maturing in
2016 on Dec. 15, followed the next day by an offering of 825
million pounds of inflation-linked securities due in 2042, the
debt agency said in a separate statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
