Middle East crude oil for sale to
Asia rose as demand from refiners climbed because alternative
grades were more expensive.  Oman  crude for immediate loading advanced 14 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $88.43 a barrel, the highest close since September
2008, according to Bloomberg data.  Dubai  for February also
climbed 0.1 percent, to $88.18 a barrel. Abu Dhabi’s  Murban 
price rose 0.1 percent to $89.56.  Asian refiners may seek more Middle East crude because it
is cheaper relative to alternatives priced against the Brent
benchmark. The  Brent-Dubai  exchange for swaps for January, or
EFS, was unchanged at $3.40 a barrel, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd. That’s the most since October 2008.  The EFS is the price difference between Brent futures and
Dubai swaps contracts and signifies Brent’s premium relative to
the Middle East grade. The exchange for swaps for February
widened 5 cents to $3.59, the most since November 2008.  Oman futures for February delivery climbed 37 cents to
$88.71 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:20 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,055 contracts traded. The settlement
price was set at $88.58 at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
