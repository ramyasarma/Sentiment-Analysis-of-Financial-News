Finnair Oyj, Finland’s biggest
airline, slid as much as 2.2 percent to 5 euros at the start of
trading in Helsinki after mediation to end the eight-day strike
by its cabin crews failed yesterday.  Finnair shares weren’t traded yesterday as the Helsinki
stock exchange was closed for a public holiday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
