Dave Wannstedt  resigned as football
coach at the  University of Pittsburgh , having compiled a 42-31
record over six seasons at his alma mater.  The Panthers had a 7-5 record this season and accepted a
bid in the  BBVA Compass Bowl  on Jan. 8 against the University of
Kentucky. Wannstedt had signed a two-year contract extension in
March after Pittsburgh went 10-3 last season, the program’s most
wins since 1981.  Wannstedt, who coached the National Football League’s Miami
Dolphins and Chicago Bears before taking over at Pitt in 2004,
will remain with the school as a special assistant to Athletic
Director  Steve Pederson .  Pittsburgh’s 26-12 record since 2008 is its best three-year
stretch since 1981-83.  Pederson said a search for Wannstedt’s replacement will
begin immediately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
