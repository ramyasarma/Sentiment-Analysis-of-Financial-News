South Korea may spend 44 trillion won
($39 billion) building nuclear, gas and coal-fired power plants
by 2024 to meet rising energy demand and replace old facilities.  The country may construct 14 more nuclear reactors, 13
coal-fired plants and 19 that use liquefied natural gas by 2024,
the  Ministry of Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today. The
proposal is a part of a government power supply-and-demand plan
that outlines investment for the next 15 years. The plan will be
finalized by the end of this year.  South Korea, which imports almost all its oil, has been
trying to cut reliance on crude and diversify energy sources
after oil prices in New York climbed to a record $147.27 a
barrel in 2008. The proposal is based on estimates that
electricity consumption in the Asia’s fourth-largest economy
will increase an average 1.9 percent annually through 2024.  Nuclear plants will provide 48.5 percent of power
generation by 2024, up from an expected 32.7 percent next year,
according to the ministry. The country will reduce reliance on
oil-fired plants to 0.5 percent from 4 percent.  Under the proposal, renewable-energy sources may account
for 8.9 percent of power generation, up from 1.8 percent, as the
government is boosting investment in solar and wind power to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Increasing use of nuclear power and renewable energy will
slow annual natural gas demand growth to 1.8 percent by 2024
from 5.6 percent between 2002 and 2009 and 17.3 percent between
1987 and 2002, state-run Korea Gas Corp. said in a separate
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
