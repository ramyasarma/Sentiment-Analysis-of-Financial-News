Air pollution in Hong Kong’s Central
business district was “very high” for the third straight day,
according to data from the Environmental Protection Department.  The pollution index was 140 in Central, 89 in Causeway Bay
and 82 in Mong Kok as of 6:00 a.m., the department said on its
website.  Readings above 100 are classified “very high” and trigger
a government warning for people with heart or respiratory
ailments to avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
