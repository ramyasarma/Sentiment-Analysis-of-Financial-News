Poland is ready to “take a tough
stance” at the European Union summit on Dec. 16-17 to make sure
the bloc doesn’t cut aid to poorer members and that payments to
private pension funds aren’t “automatically” added to the
country’s public debt, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said today in
Warsaw.  Poland is ready to use “all instruments granted by
treaty” to defend its positions on the EU budget and pensions
and has lined up support from several countries, including
Hungary and the Baltic states, Tusk told reporters at a press
conference.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
