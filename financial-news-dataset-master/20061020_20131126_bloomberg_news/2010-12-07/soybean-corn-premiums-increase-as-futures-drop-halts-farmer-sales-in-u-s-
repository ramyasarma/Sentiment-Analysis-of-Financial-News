Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped this month to export terminals near New Orleans at the
mouth of the Mississippi River rose as farmers withheld supplies
after futures fell.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
December rose to 80 cents to 82 cents a bushel above January
futures, compared with 77 cents to 82 cents yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  show. Corn premiums climbed to 47
cents to 49 cents above March futures from 46 cents to 47 cents.  “The bids are improving to get increased supplies as the
year-end holidays approach,” said Hugh Whalen, a commodity risk
consultant at  Mid-Co Commodities Inc.  in Bloomington, Illinois.
“We are seeing some cash merchants bidding more aggressively
for immediate supplies.”  Soybean futures for January delivery declined 3 cents, or
0.2 percent, to close at $12.855 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Yesterday, the price fell 0.9 percent after reaching a
three-week high of $13.0675.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 6.25 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $5.6175 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached
$5.7575, the highest since Nov. 15. The grain dropped 1 percent
yesterday.  Barge-freight costs may rise into January as shippers rush
to move grain and oilseeds to New Orleans before ice forms and
forces river closures in the coming weeks, Whalen said.  “The colder weather is also playing a role in reducing
movement of grain,” Whalen said. “Supplies are going to get
tougher to get in the next few weeks, so exporters are willing
to pay more now” to boost inventories, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
