Daimler AG  will invest an additional
2 billion rand ($290 million) at a Mercedes-Benz plant on South
Africa’s southeast coast to expand production.  The investment will prepare the  East London  factory for
production of the next-generation Mercedes-Benz C-Class starting
in 2014, Daimler said in a statement today. The plant, along
with facilities in Germany, China and the U.S., will build the
new C-Class, the company’s most popular passenger model.  The plant has “managed to provide us with a business and
production plan that is competitive globally,”  Wolfgang Bernhard , Mercedes-Benz production and purchasing chief, said in
the statement.  Daimler, the world’s second-largest maker of luxury
vehicles, has invested more than 5 billion rand in South Africa
over the past 10 years and the East London plant recently
exported its 100,000th C-Class model, according to today’s
statement. The South African plant will manufacture left-and
right-hand drive C-Class models for export to the rest of Africa
and the Asia-Pacific region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
