PNC Financial Services Group Inc. ,
the sixth-largest U.S. bank by deposits, is seeking approval
from regulators for a dividend increase or share buyback, said
Chief Executive Officer  James E. Rohr .  “Our board of directors views an increase in the dividend
as a key priority,” Rohr, 62, said today at a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. investor conference in New York. “Either option
would require approval from regulators and we are pursuing that
as we speak.”  PNC, based in Pittsburgh, held $20.4 billion of Tier 1
common equity at the end of September, according to company
filings. It’s been cutting costs and working to generate new
business from the $3.9 billion acquisition of National City
Corp. In October, the lender said third-quarter  net  income
almost doubled from a year earlier to $1.1 billion.  PNC may announce an increase in its  dividend  as early as
March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank slashed
the dividend last year to 10 cents a share from 66 cents to
conserve capital.  PNC rose 71 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $58.02 at 2:23 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
climbed  10 percent  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
