MasterCard Inc. , the world’s second-
biggest payments network, and Visa Europe Ltd. are suspending
use of their brands by WikiLeaks, which released thousands of
secret U.S. military and State Department documents.  MasterCard and London-based Visa Europe, operator of the
largest card network in the European Union, are following  EBay
Inc.  unit PayPal, which recently cut access to WikiLeaks for
violating the online payment processor’s acceptable use policy.  “MasterCard is currently in the process of working to
suspend the acceptance of MasterCard cards on WikiLeaks,” said
James Issokson, a spokesman for the Purchase, New York-based
company, in an e-mailed statement today.  The actions are the latest in a series by companies that
may crimp access to funds for WikiLeaks. PostFinance, the
banking arm of SwissPost, closed a bank account held by
WikiLeaks founder  Julian Assange , saying he doesn’t qualify to
be a client.  Amazon.com Inc.  dropped WikiLeaks from its website-
hosting service for breaching terms of service.  Simon Kleine, a spokesman for Visa Europe, said in an e-
mail that the firm suspended Visa payment acceptance on
WikiLeak’s website “pending further investigation into the
nature of its business and whether it contravenes Visa operating
rules.”  Visa Europe and San Francisco-based Visa Inc. are separate
companies. Cnet reported MasterCard’s decision earlier today on
its website.  U.K. Arrest  Assange, 39, was arrested in the U.K. today after Swedish
police issued an international arrest warrant on rape
allegations. Assange, who was denied bail, challenged the
request to turn him over to Swedish authorities.  Mark Stephens , Assange’s U.K. lawyer with the firm Finers
Stephens Innocent LLP in London, told reporters outside court
that the bail ruling was “unfortunate.” He said that many
people believe the allegations in Sweden are politically
motivated. Stephens represents media organizations, including
Bloomberg News.  MasterCard didn’t receive a request from the U.S.
government or any third party before acting, according to
spokesman  Chris Monteiro . “This decision was MasterCard’s
alone,” he said.  WikiLeaks drew condemnation for posting thousands of
classified documents on its website, including U.S. embassy
communications and a military video of a July 2007 helicopter
attack in Iraq that killed a Reuters television cameraman and
his driver.  Created in 2006, WikiLeaks receives confidential material
and posts it on the Internet “so readers and historians alike
can see evidence of the truth,” the nonprofit organization says
on its website. WikiLeaks relies on donations to fund operations
and accepts payments via credit card, bank transfer and postal
mail, according to the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
