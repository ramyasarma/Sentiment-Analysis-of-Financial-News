Corn and soybean futures declined for
the second straight day on speculation that rain will improve
soil moisture for developing crops in Brazil and Argentina, the
world’s biggest exporters behind the U.S.  As much as 0.5 inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain fell in
Argentina in the past 24 hours and another storm, expected on
Dec. 11, will bring as much as 1 inch to the driest growing
areas,  Mike Tannura , the president of T-Storm Weather, said in a
report. Precipitation in the next week will maintain beneficial
conditions for crops in Brazil, he said.  “Improved rainfall in South America has encouraged
speculative selling,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. “It’s all about an
improving weather story.”  Corn futures for March delivery fell 6.25 cents, or 1.1
percent, to close at $5.6175 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $5.7575, the
highest since Nov. 15. The grain dropped 1 percent yesterday.  Soybean futures for January delivery declined 3 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $12.855 a bushel. Yesterday, the price fell 0.9
percent after reaching a three-week high of $13.0675.  On Nov. 9, corn jumped to a 26-month high of $6.175 after
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said adverse weather reduced
the size of the domestic crop. On Nov. 12, soybeans reached
$13.485, the highest since August 2009, as Chinese demand surged
for U.S. supplies.  Australian Wheat  Corn prices also fell on speculation that increasing
supplies of Australian wheat for livestock feed will erode Asian
demand for U.S. grain supplies, said Brian Grete, the senior
market analyst at Professional Farmers of America newsletter in
Cedar Falls, Iowa.  “Asian feed buyers will buy a lot of lower-quality wheat
from Australia because of cheaper shipping costs and prices than
U.S. corn,” Grete said. “The rain-damaged wheat crop in
Australia had a negative impact on corn.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
