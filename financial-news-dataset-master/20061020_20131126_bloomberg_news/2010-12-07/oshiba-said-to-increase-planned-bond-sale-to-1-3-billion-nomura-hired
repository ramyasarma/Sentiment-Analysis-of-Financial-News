Toshiba Corp.  raised the size of a
planned bond sale to 110 billion yen ($1.3 billion) from 80
billion yen, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The world’s second-largest maker of flash-memory chips told
investors it plans to sell 70 billion yen of five-year bonds on
Dec. 9 priced to yield 15 basis points more than the yen swap
rate, said the person, asking not to be identified as the
information is private.  The Tokyo-based company also plans to sell 25 billion yen
of seven-year bonds at a 23 basis-point spread, and 15 billion
yen of 10-year notes at a 30 basis-point spread, the person said.
Proceeds will repay “loans and maturing commercial paper,”
Toshiba spokesman  Ken Shinjo  said in a telephone interview today,
declining to elaborate.  It will be the biggest debt sale by a Japanese manufacturer
since Toshiba raised 120 billion yen in January, including 70
billion yen of 1.18 percent, four-year bonds priced at a 50
basis-point spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company, whose products range from nuclear power plants to
semiconductors and home appliances, has 98.5 billion yen of
bonds maturing next year, the data show.  Sales of corporate bonds in Japan fell 17 percent to 9.025
trillion yen this year from the same period of 2009, Bloomberg
data show, as companies cut spending.  Machinery orders , an
indicator of capital spending in three to six months, probably
fell 0.1 percent in October after dropping 10.3 percent the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists before a report due tomorrow.  Nomura Securities Co., Mizuho Securities Co. and Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets Co. are helping Toshiba sell the
bonds, according to a Nov. 19 e-mailed statement from Nomura.  To contact the reporters on this story:
