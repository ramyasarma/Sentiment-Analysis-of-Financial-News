Iberdrola Renovables SA  and  EDP
Renovaveis SA  climbed after UBS AG raised its rating on the
Iberian renewable energy companies to “buy” from “neutral.”  Iberdrola Renovables rose as much as 5.9 percent, the most
in five months, in Madrid trading and EDP Renovaveis gained as
much as 6 percent, the most intra-day since July. Iberdrola
Renovables was up 5.3 percent at 2.49 euros at 11:09 a.m. local
time and EDP Renovaveis gained 5.2 percent to 4.16 euros.  The wind power developers’ shares slumped this year as the
Spanish government mulled changes to subsidized rates for
alternative energy producers, U.S. returns dipped and they
downgraded earnings forecasts. Last week, Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero ’s cabinet cut some wind subsidies by a
third for the next two years.  “These risks have now played out,” UBS analyst Alberto Gandolfini  said in a report. “These negatives now seem to be
behind us and are more than discounted in the shares at current
levels.”  Gandolfini raised his price target for Renovables to 2.80
euros from 2.50 euros and increased his target for Renovaveis to
5.00 euros from 4.50 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
