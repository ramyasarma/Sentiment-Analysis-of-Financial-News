The European Central Bank bought
Irish and Portuguese government bonds today, according to at
least two people with knowledge of the transactions.  Central banks were also buying Greek debt, said one of the
people, who asked not to be identified because the deals are
confidential. A spokesman for the ECB in Frankfurt declined to
comment.  Irish 10-year bonds rose, sending the yield down nine basis
points to 8.28 percent as of 12:27 p.m. in London.  Similar-maturity Portuguese debt yields rose 12 basis
points to 6.21 percent. Greek 10-year bond yields were 12 basis
points higher at 11.78 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
