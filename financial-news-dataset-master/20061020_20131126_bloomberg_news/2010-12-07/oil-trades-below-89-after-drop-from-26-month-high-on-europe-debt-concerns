Oil declined for a second day as
concern that Europe’s debt crisis is spreading drove speculation
fuel demand will drop and as an industry report showed U.S.
gasoline supplies surged the most since January.  Futures extended yesterday’s 0.8 percent slide as traders
secured profits from a rally to $90.76 a barrel, the highest in
26 months. European ministers ruled out immediate aid for
Portugal and Spain or an increase in the 750 billion-euro ($992
million) crisis fund. The American Petroleum Institute said
gasoline stockpiles  increased  4.8 million barrels last week.  “There are still concerns about the European economy,”
said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity derivative sales manager at
Newedge, a brokerage, in Tokyo. “This increase in products is
having a larger impact on the crude market. Ninety dollars will
be a major resistance level. It’s a good time to take profit.”  Crude for January delivery lost as much as $1.08, or 1.2
percent, to $87.61 a barrel, in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was at $87.88 at 8:31
a.m. London time. Yesterday, it snapped a four-day rally after
rising to the highest price since Oct. 8, 2008. Brent crude for
January settlement fell as much as $1.12, or 1.2 percent, to
$90.27 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Europe’s economic situation is “serious” and its
institutions must act more quickly to stem contagion from the
sovereign-debt crisis, International Monetary Fund Managing
Director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  said in Athens yesterday.  “The market continues to worry over Europe’s ability to
prevent debt issues from spreading,”  Mark Pervan , head of
commodity research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
in Melbourne, said in a note today. “Crude prices lost
momentum, potentially as cautious long investors took profits
due to uncertainty in the market.”  Crude Stockpiles  Oil has risen 11 percent this year in New York, heading for
its second consecutive annual increase. Prices soared 78 percent
in 2009, the most since they more than doubled in 1999.  U.S. crude stockpiles decreased 7.34 million barrels to
349.3 million last week, the industry-funded API said yesterday.
An Energy Department report today will  probably show  supplies
dropped 1.4 million barrels, according to the median estimate
from 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Distillate fuel inventories, which include heating oil and
diesel, increased 1.7 million barrels to 159.3 million, the API
said. The Energy Department’s report, due at 10:30 a.m. in
Washington, is expected to show stockpiles  declined  900,000
barrels, based on the survey. Gasoline inventories probably
 slipped  300,000 barrels.  “Investors will be closely watching U.S. oil inventory
reports for evidence of improved demand,” said Pervan at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group.  OPEC Supply  Oil’s rally is unlikely to coax OPEC into raising
production quotas at a meeting this week in Ecuador, as group
members consider the global economic recovery strong enough to
withstand price gains.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
accounts for about 40 percent of global supply, will maintain
limits set in 2008 when representatives gather in Quito on Dec.
11, according to all but one of 39 analysts and traders in a
Bloomberg News survey. Oil ministers from Angola, Venezuela and
Libya say the group will probably stand by its target to pump
 24.845 million  barrels a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
