U.S. Representative  Spencer Bachus 
has received an endorsement from a key group of Republicans in
his bid to become chairman of the House Financial Services
Committee when his party takes power next month, according to
two House aides briefed on the matter.  Bachus the Alabama lawmaker who has been the panel’s top
minority member since 2007, was selected to become chairman by
the Republican Steering Committee in a closed-door vote today,
said the aides who declined to be identified because the
decision isn’t public. Selections by the committee -- made up of
House leaders, incoming committee chairmen and members
representing different parts of the country -- are traditionally
accepted by the full Republican conference, which is scheduled
to vote tomorrow.  Representative  Ed Royce  of California mounted a challenge
to Bachus’s bid to lead the committee that oversees Wall Street,
citing his own leadership in efforts to rein in Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac before losses linked to subprime mortgages forced
the government-backed firms into U.S. conservatorship. Royce and
Bachus made presentations to the steering panel last week.  The new Republican chairman will replace Representative
 Barney Frank , the Massachusetts Democrat who led the committee
during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Frank spearheaded House work on the $700 billion bank bailout in
2008, the law that allowed the federal takeover of Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac and, in July, the passage of the financial-
regulation overhaul named.  To contact the reporter on this story:
