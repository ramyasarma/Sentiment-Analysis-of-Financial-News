Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan
said further cuts in the country’s social welfare spending are
“unavoidable” to help push down the country’s budget deficit.  “Over the next four years, further reductions in social
welfare spending are unavoidable if we are to reduce the budget
deficit,” Lenihan told parliament in Dublin today, when
presenting the budget for 2011. “Our number one priority for
2011 and onwards must be economic growth and maximising
employment creation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
