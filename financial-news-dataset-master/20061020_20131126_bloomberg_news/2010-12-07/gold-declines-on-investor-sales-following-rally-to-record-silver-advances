Gold futures fell as investors
stepped up sales following a six-session rally to a record.
Silver extended an advance to a 30-year high.  Earlier, gold reached an all-time high of $1,432.50 an
ounce as the dollar fell to a three-week low against the yen and
weakened against most other major counterparts after President
 Barack Obama  agreed to extend tax cuts. The metal priced in
euros also reached a record.  “You have some very willing sellers,” said  Matthew Zeman ,
a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “We are
coming to the end of the year, and with gold making another
high, it’s a good time to take profit.”  Gold futures for delivery in February fell $7.10, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $1,409 an ounce on the Comex in New York,
the first decline since Nov. 26. Gold for immediately delivery
reached a record $1,431.25.  On the Comex, gold has jumped 29 percent this year, heading
for the 10th straight annual gain, after governments spent
trillions of dollars and kept borrowing costs low to bolster
economies hurt by the most-severe global recession since World
War II.  “We have no real growth and no interest-rate hikes coming
along,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services in Chicago. “The longer-term view is that
governments will continue to provide liquidity to the markets
and debase their currencies. This sets up gold for much higher
prices.”  ‘Inflationary Event’  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
fell for the first time in a week after reaching the highest in
almost 26 months. Assets of gold in  exchange-traded products 
rose 0.75 metric ton to 2,099.15 tons yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers.  “With the Fed providing cheap money and tax cuts spurring
people to spend money, the gold market is looking at this as an
inflationary event,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 4.2 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $29.777 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price
reached $30.75, the highest for a most-active contract since
March 1980. The metal has gained 77 percent this year.  Palladium futures for March delivery slipped $12.70, or 1.7
percent, to $738.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The price has jumped 81 percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell $8.40, or 0.5
percent, to $1,705.20 an ounce. The metal has gained 16 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
