Bellway Plc (BWY) , the U.K. homebuilder
focused on first-time buyers, said its profit margin increased
as the company sold more homes for higher prices.  Home completions for the 12 months through July rose 7.1
percent to 4,922 as the average selling price advanced 7.2
percent to about 175,000 pounds ($285,000), the company, based
in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said today in a statement.  “Bellway’s continuing aims for 2011/2012 are to deliver
incremental volume growth, repair operating margins, and,
through changes in product mix, improve average selling
prices,” the company said.  The operating profit margin for fiscal 2011 rose to between
8 percent and 9 percent, from 6.7 percent a year earlier,
Bellway said. The second-half margin was close to 10 percent.  Bellway also said that Finance Director Alistair Leitch
will retire at the end of January 2012 to be replaced by Group
Chief Accountant Keith Adey.  Leitch, who will be 58 in January and is a month older than
Chief Executive OfficerJohn Watson, said that Watson is likely
to retire in 2014, when he will be 60.  “I said that I would go earlier because we need some sort
of orderly  succession plan ,” Leitch said in a telephone
interview today. “As far as John is concerned, any succession
is two-and-a-half years away.”  Reservation rates since June are higher than last year, the
company said without being more specific. Bellway spent about
250 million pounds on land and land-related purchases in the
year through July. In addition it agreed to buy another 4,500
plots of land valued at about 230 million pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
