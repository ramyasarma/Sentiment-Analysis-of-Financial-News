Treasuries remained lower as the
government sold $32 billion of three-year notes in the first of
three note and bond sales this week totaling $66 billion after
President  Barack Obama  said he will agree to extend his
predecessor’s tax cuts for two years.  The securities drew a yield of 0.862 percent, compared with
the average forecast of 0.841 percent in a Bloomberg News survey
of 6 of the Federal Reserve’s 18 primary dealers. The  bid-to-
cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of securities offered, was 2.91. The average at the
past 10 auctions was 3.15.  Investors “feel rates are going to rise,”  Thomas L. di Galoma , head of U.S. rates trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a
New-York based brokerage for institutional investors, said
before the auction. “There’s a case to be made for a risk-on
trade. Money’s flowing into the system, it looks like the
economy’s being reflated by the Federal Reserve, and you just
got a tax cut.”  The  yield  on the existing three-year note rose 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 0.82 percent at 1:05 p.m.
in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The benchmark
10-year yield gained 18 basis points to 3.10 percent.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 36.7 percent of the notes,
compared with 35 percent in the November auction. The average
for the past 10 sales is 44 percent.  Direct Bidders  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 18 percent of
the debt, compared with 13.9 percent last month and a 10-sale
average of 13.2.  The last sale of three-year notes, on Nov. 8, drew a yield
of 0.575 percent. The U.S. will auction $21 billion of 10-year
notes tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on Dec. 9.  Three-year notes have returned 4.9 percent this year,
compared with 7.3 percent for the overall Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Obama said he would accept a lower rate for the estate tax
than Democrats wanted in order to break a stalemate over
extending  George W. Bush ’s tax cuts before Congress adjourns.  The current tax rates, enacted in 2001 and 2003, are set
to expire Dec. 31. Without the compromise, middle-income
families would become “collateral damage for political warfare
here in Washington,” Obama said in televised remarks yesterday.  Bond ‘Catalyst’  “The policy compromise has been the catalyst to take us
through 3 percent on the 10-year note,” said  Suvrat Prakash , an
interest-rate strategist in New York at BNP Paribas, which as a
primary bidder is required to bid at Treasury auctions. “Yields
in the front end are relatively high.”  Treasuries fell before reports this week that economists
said will show fewer Americans filed claims for unemployment
benefits and consumer confidence rose.  Jobless claims  decreased by 11,000 to 425,000 in the week
ended Dec. 4, according to the median forecast of 48 economists
before the Labor Department’s report Dec. 9. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary  index  of consumer
sentiment rose to 72.5 in December from 71.6 in the prior month,
a separate Bloomberg survey showed before the Dec. 10 report.  German 10-year government bonds, the euro region’s
benchmark securities, dropped as traders speculated that Ireland
will win parliamentary approval for an austerity plan as it
seeks to seal an international bailout.  Ireland Spending Cuts  Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  told parliament in
Dublin today that while cutting spending by 6 billion euros
($8 billion) next year is “demanding,” it shows the
government’s commitment to reducing the budget deficit.  The German 10-year yield rose as much as nine basis points
to 2.94 percent, the highest level since May 13.  Treasuries rallied yesterday, pushing the 10-year note
yield down the most since Nov. 16, after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in an interview broadcast Dec. 5 on CBS Corp.’s
“60 Minutes” program that the central bank may boost debt
purchases to support the economy. The central bank bought today
$6.81 billion of Treasuries maturing from December 2014 to May
2016, according to the New York Fed’s  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
