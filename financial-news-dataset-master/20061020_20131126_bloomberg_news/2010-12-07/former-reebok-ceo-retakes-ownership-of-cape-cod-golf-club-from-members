Former Reebok Chief Executive Officer
 Paul Fireman , who owns New Jersey’s $130 million Liberty
National Golf Club, added a Cape Cod course to his collection.  Fireman has reassumed ownership of  Willowbend Country Club 
from the members, 18 years after purchasing the private Mashpee,
Massachusetts, facility at a government auction for $8.5
million.  Financial problems led club members to transfer ownership
back to Fireman in a unanimous vote last month, a year earlier
than a 2007 agreement called for, David Wood, the club’s vice
president, said in a statement.  Fireman served as Willowbend’s sole owner starting in 1992
before transferring it back to the members in 2007 after
unsuccessfully trying to sell the 27-hole facility for $33
million, the Boston Globe reported.  The club, which counts New England Patriots owner  Robert Kraft  among its members, will now operate “without the
managerial or financial burden falling to the members,” Wood
said.  Fireman, who sold Canton, Massachusetts-based shoemaker
 Reebok International Ltd.  to  Adidas AG  for $3.8 billion in 2006,
opened the Liberty National club in Jersey City, New Jersey, in
2005. It hosted the U.S. PGA Tour’s Barclays tournament four
years later.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael Buteau  in
