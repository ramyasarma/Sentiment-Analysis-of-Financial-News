Derek Jeter said today he was
“angry” at how public his contract negotiations with the New
York Yankees became.  Jeter spoke at a news conference in Tampa, Florida, hours
after the Yankees announced he had agreed to a three-year
contract to stay with the only Major League Baseball team
he’s ever played for.  ‘I was most angry at how I was portrayed,’’ Jeter said.
“Suddenly it was, I had greed, I had arrogance. I thought it
was portrayed kind of incorrectly.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
