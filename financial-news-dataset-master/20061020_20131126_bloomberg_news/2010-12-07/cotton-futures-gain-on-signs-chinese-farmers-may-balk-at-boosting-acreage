Cotton rose for the sixth time in
seven sessions on signs that this year’s rally to a record may
fail to boost planting in China, the world’s biggest grower.
Orange-juice futures fell.  The China Cotton Association said wide price swings and
high costs may discourage farmers from increasing acreage.
Before today, cotton futures in New York advanced 73 percent
this year and prices in China topped $2 a pound as global demand
outpaced supplies and inventories plunged in the U.S., the
leading exporter.  “If $2 doesn’t cause somebody to want to plant cotton, I
don’t know what else will,” said  Sid Love , the president of Joe
Kropf & Sid Love Consulting Services LLC in Overland Park,
Kansas. Plantings may depend on China’s steps to curb inflation,
he said.  Cotton for March delivery rose 1.79 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $1.322 a pound at 10:07 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Last week, the most-active contract jumped 18 percent, the most
since July 9, 1971. On Nov. 10, the most-active contract reached
a record $1.5195.  “Cotton is a labor-intensive crop,” the China Cotton
Association said, citing a survey of 1,700 farmers in 12
provinces last month. “That’s why the volatile prices and high
input costs such as labor and raw materials have prevented
farmers from greatly increasing the acreage.”  ‘Short Supply’  Demand in China is forecast to outpace production by 17
million bales in the season that ends July 31, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. The deficit reached 18 million
bales the year before, the USDA said in a Nov. 9  report . A bale
weighs about 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  “You have not eliminated the reason we are up here in the
first place,” said  Tom Reardon , the president of Delta
Brokerage in New York. “Cotton is in very short supply.”  Orange-juice futures for January delivery dropped 2.95
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $1.615 a pound in New York. Yesterday,
the price jumped to the highest since May 2007 on concern that a
cold snap would hurt Florida’s crop.  Before today, orange juice gained 27 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
