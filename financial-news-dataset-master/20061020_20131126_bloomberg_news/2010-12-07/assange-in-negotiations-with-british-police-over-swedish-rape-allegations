Julian Assange , founder of the
 WikiLeaks  website that leaked thousands of classified U.S.
military and State Department documents, is in negotiations with
U.K. police over a Swedish rape charge, his lawyer said.  Assange, a 39-year-old Australian, negotiated with London’s
Metropolitan Police yesterday and may do so again today, said
 Mark Stephens , Assange’s U.K. lawyer.  “I expect them to resume today,” Stephens said in an e-
mail. Assange denies the allegations, he said. Stephens, of the
firm Finers Stephens Innocent LLP in London, regularly
represents several media organizations, including Bloomberg
News.  A Swedish court on Nov. 19 approved an arrest warrant for
Assange on suspicion of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful
coercion, paving the way for an international search. An appeals
court upheld the warrant while reducing the case to a “less
serious” rape charge. On Dec. 2, the Supreme Court rejected
Assange’s request to review the case.  WikiLeaks, created in 2006, drew condemnation from the U.S.
for posting thousands of classified State Department documents
on its website. WikiLeaks.org receives confidential material and
posts the information on the Internet “so readers and
historians alike can see evidence of the truth,” the
organization says on its website.  U.K. police declined to comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
