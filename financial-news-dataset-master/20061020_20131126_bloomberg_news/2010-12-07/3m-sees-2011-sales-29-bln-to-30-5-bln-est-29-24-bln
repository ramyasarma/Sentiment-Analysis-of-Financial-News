3M Co.  dropped the most of any
company on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  after predicting
sales volumes at existing businesses would rise more slowly in
2011 than this year.  So-called organic-sales volume may expand 5.5 percent to
7.5 percent in 2011, the company said in a statement today. That
compares with growth of as much as 14 percent this year that 3M
projected in October after gains of 16 percent in the first nine
months.  Earnings next year will rise to $5.90 to $6.10 a share,
including a year-over-year increase in pension costs of 27 cents
a share, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based  company  said. That trails
the $6.20  average estimate  of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Investors may be disappointed with the organic-growth
estimate,”  Jeff Windau , a St. Louis-based analyst with Edward
Jones, said in an e-mail. “In addition, investors could have
some economic concerns that the developed countries (like the
U.S., countries in Europe) may not grow as anticipated and put
additional pressure on results.”  The company’s long-term target for organic-sales volume
growth is 7 percent to 8 percent, Chief Financial Officer
 Patrick Campbell  said today during a  meeting  with analysts and
investors in New York.  3M  slid  $2.69, or 3.1 percent, to $84.19 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. That was the worst decline among 30
stocks in the Dow index, and 3M’s biggest drop since Oct. 28.  Revenue next year may be $29 billion to $30.5 billion, 3M
said.  Analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg estimated 2011 sales of
$29.2 billion, on average.  ‘International Presence’  Windau, who has a “buy”  rating  on the shares, said
investors may benefit from 3M’s “strong international
presence,” especially in emerging markets such as China and
India.  Such markets make up one-third of 3M sales and may climb to
45 percent by 2015, Chief Executive Officer  George W. Buckley 
said in the statement.  The maker of Scotch tape and films to brighten television
screens maintained its 2010 earnings projection of $5.70 to
$5.74 a share on sales of as much as $26.4 billion, excluding a
Medicare-related charge, according to the statement. The average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was earnings of $5.74
a share on sales of $26.5 billion.  3M has announced at least $2 billion in acquisitions this
year, the highest in a decade, as the company adds to its
health-care, security and industrial operations.  Acquisitions  in
high-growth businesses include Cogent Inc. and Attenti Holdings
SA in security and Arizant Inc. in health care, 3M said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
