TDC A/S , Denmark’s biggest phone
company, will probably set a price for its share sale at around
the middle point of the original offer range, according to terms
for the sale.  The banks managing the offering narrowed the price range to
between 50 kroner to 52 kroner each, according to a sales
document obtained by Bloomberg. TDC’s private-equity owners had
previously been offering 210 million shares for 47 kroner to 56
kroner apiece. They may sell another 31.5 million shares through
an overallotment option if demand is sufficient, bringing the
total offering to as much as 12.6 billion kroner ($2.3 billion)
if priced at 52 kroner each.  Apax Partners LLP,  Blackstone Group LP ,  KKR & Co. , Permira
Advisers LLP and Providence Equity Partners Inc. acquired their
88 percent stake in TDC in 2006 in a transaction worth about
$15.3 billion, including net debt.  The buyout firms are selling a stake as investors seek
dividend yields from European telecommunications stocks after
years of rapid growth and overseas acquisitions. TDC’s Chief
Executive Officer  Henrik Poulsen  has promised to return 80
percent to 85 percent of free cash flow to investors in
dividends. The Copenhagen-based company plans to pay a  dividend 
of 4.35 kroner a share in 2011.  TDC also plans to buy back as much as 9 billion kroner of
stock from all shareholders. The buyout firms will retain a
stake of as much as 60 percent after the share sale and buyback,
Poulsen said in a conference call on Nov. 25.  Managers for the sale,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Morgan
Stanley, SEB AB,  Deutsche Bank AG  and UBS AG will stop taking
orders at 12 p.m. in London tomorrow, according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
