Germany’s Martin Kaymer and Graeme
McDowell of Northern Ireland were voted joint winners of the
European tour Golfer of the Year award.  Kaymer, 25, won four times on the tour, taking his first
major title with a playoff victory at the PGA Championship.
McDowell, 31, won three times, and became the first European to
win the U.S. Open in 40 years.  Both men were members of the European team that won the
Ryder Cup this year.  It was the first time since the award began in 1985 that
there were joint winners. A panel of golf reporters and editors
vote for the award.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
