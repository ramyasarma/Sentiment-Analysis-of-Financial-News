The U.S. must bolster its trusted
traveler programs as it works to thwart terror threats so that
customs workers can focus on people most likely to cause harm,
Customs and Border Protection Commissioner  Alan Bersin  said.  Customs, which runs the so-called  Global Entry program  and
programs focusing on borders with Canada and Mexico, wants to
increase the number of participants in those programs to 3.5
million people in two to three years from the approximately
900,000 now registered, Bersin said today at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce in Washington. The programs’ automated kiosks would
help speed pre-approved travelers through customs lines as they
enter the U.S., he said.  “Our inspectors will be able to spend time on those
travelers about whom we do not have a level of confidence to
hasten your movement through the line,” he said.  Bersin’s comments come almost a year after  Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a Nigerian man, hid explosives in his underwear
and tried to detonate them on a Northwest Airlines flight to
Detroit. Abdulmutallab had been flagged for secondary screening
once his international flight reached the U.S., which “would
have been too late,” Bersin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
