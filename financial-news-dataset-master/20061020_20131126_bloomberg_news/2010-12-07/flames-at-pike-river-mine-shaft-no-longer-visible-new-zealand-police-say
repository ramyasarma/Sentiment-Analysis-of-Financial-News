Workers have extinguished flames from
the vent shaft of New Zealand’s  Pike River  coal mine where 29
men were presumed killed last month while an underground fire
continues to prevent a recovery of bodies, police said.  While conditions in the West Coast mine are still too
dangerous for teams to enter, exterior flames are no longer
visible and temperatures around its vent are cooling, according
to an e-mailed statement today. Gas readings are also displaying
some positive signs, with some areas showing as inert.  Teams have been unable to enter the mine, near Greymouth in
the country’s South Island, since an explosion on Nov. 19
trapped the men and released toxic gases. Police declared the
miners, aged from 17 to 62, to be dead five days later after a
second explosion ended all hopes of a rescue. Workers are now
trying to douse a coal fire caused by a fourth blast.  “Safety remains paramount and we can’t just put the fire
out and rush in there,” Superintendent Gary Knowles said in the
statement. Entry to the mine is “a long way off,” according to
the statement.  The Pike River recovery operation is likely to take
“weeks, if not months,” Knowles said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
