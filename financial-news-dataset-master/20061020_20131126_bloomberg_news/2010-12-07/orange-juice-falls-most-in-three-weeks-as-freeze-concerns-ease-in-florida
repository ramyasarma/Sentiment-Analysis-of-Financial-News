Orange-juice futures fell the most in
three weeks as cold-weather concerns eased in Florida, the
world’s second-largest grower.  Less than 10 percent of Florida’s citrus belt had frost
damage after a cold snap yesterday, said Kyle Tapley, a
meteorologist at MDA Information Systems Inc. in Rockville,
Maryland. “The problem was a little spotty. There wasn’t
widespread damage.”  Orange juice for January delivery dropped 3.75 cents, or
2.3 percent, to settle at $1.607 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest decline for a most-active
contract since Nov. 16. In the previous four sessions, the price
rallied 10 percent.  The commodity has gained 25 percent this year on supply
concerns, and yesterday jumped to $1.667, the highest since May
2007.  “It definitely was an early frost this year, but it looks
like the temperatures are going to be safely warming up after
tonight,” said  Fain Shaffer , the president of Infinity Trading
Corp. in Medford, Oregon. Yesterday’s rally may have marked a
“short-term high,” he said.  Brazil is the largest orange grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
