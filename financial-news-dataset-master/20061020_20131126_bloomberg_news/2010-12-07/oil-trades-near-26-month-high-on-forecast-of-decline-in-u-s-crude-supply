Oil climbed above $90 a barrel to the
highest price in two years before a report forecast to show that
U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the first time in three weeks.  Futures rose as much as 1.5 percent to trade as high as
$90.76 in New York. Inventories declined 1.5 million barrels, or
0.4 percent, in the seven days ended Dec. 3 from 359.7 million a
week earlier, the Energy Department will report tomorrow,
according to a Bloomberg survey. Oil’s 14-day relative strength
index, a measure of how fast prices have risen or dropped in
that period, was at 67.7, close to the 70 level traders
typically see as a signal that prices may reverse.  “In the U.S. itself the excess in inventories has come off
very, very quickly,” said  Amrita Sen , an analyst at Barclays
Plc in London. “Over the last five or six weeks, you’ve eroded
about 40 million barrels of inventories. It’s tightening, and it
should continue to erode as we progress into the new year.”  Crude for January delivery gained as much as $1.38 a barrel
to the highest price since Oct. 8, 2008 in electronic trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. It traded at $90.69 at 1:56
p.m. London time. Brent crude for January settlement advanced as
much as $1.41, or 1.5 percent to $92.86 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Futures in New York recouped an earlier 0.7 percent decline
as the  Dollar Index , a measure of the currency against six major
peers, slipped 0.3 percent. Oil climbed yesterday amid
speculation that the U.S. may extend economic stimulus measures
and on forecasts of cold weather for the U.S. and Europe. Crude
gained 13 percent this year.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  Longest Sequence  Gasoline  supplies are expected to have risen 875,000
barrels, or 0.4 percent, from 210.2 million, Bloomberg’s survey
showed. It would be the third weekly gain, the longest sequence
of increases since August. Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, probably
decreased 550,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent, from 158.1 million.  “The expectations are that we’ll see some inventory
drawdowns tomorrow,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst with
VTB Capital in London. “A weaker dollar is helping support
crude, though macro sentiment is mixed. The market is
overbought, and any escalation in concern about risk could
trigger profit-taking.”  The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will
release weekly supply and demand data later today. MasterCard
Inc. will also publish its weekly SpendingPulse report with data
on U.S. gasoline demand.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
responsible for 40 percent of global oil supplies, will meet to
review its production quota on Dec. 11 in Quito, Ecuador. The
organization hasn’t changed its output target since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
