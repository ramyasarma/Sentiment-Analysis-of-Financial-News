U.S. stocks pared gains after an
earlier rally took the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its
highest level in more than two years.  The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to 1,224.54 at 3:20 p.m. in
New York after earlier climbing as much as 1 percent to
1,235.05, its highest intraday level since Sept. 22, 2008. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 1 point, or less
than 0.1 percent, to 11,363.10, erasing most of a 89-point
rally.  The 10-year Treasury yield jumped 23 basis points to 3.148
percent, the highest since June.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
