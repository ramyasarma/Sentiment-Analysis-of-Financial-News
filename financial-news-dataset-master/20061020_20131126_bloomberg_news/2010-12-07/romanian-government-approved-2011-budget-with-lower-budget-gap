Romania’s  government  approved a
budget draft for 2011 late yesterday to qualify for
international bailout loans, and will send it to Parliament for
debate and approval by the end of this year.  The 2011 budget plan foresees spending cuts to target a
deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP next year, from a target of 6.8
percent this year, after the government raised a value-added tax
and cut public wages to keep its International Monetary Fund-led
bailout going, Finance Minister  Gheorghe Ialomitianu  said in an
e-mailed statement. The budget envisages economic growth of 1.5
percent next year, after output will probably contract for a
second year in 2010 and shrink as much as 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
