New Jersey Turnpike Authority ’s $1.5
billion sale of Build America Bonds, this week’s largest
scheduled sale, is being offered at yields of about 2.88
percentage points above 30-year Treasuries, according to a
person with knowledge of the deal.  The taxable bonds, which are being marketed worldwide, are
scheduled for formal pricing tomorrow, according to Tom Feeney,
a spokesman for the Turnpike Authority. The agency’s only other
Build America issue, a $1.375 billion deal in April 2009, priced
to yield 3.7 percentage points, or 370 basis points, above
comparable Treasuries, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  “It seems a bit tight, but is probably close to where it
needs to be to get the deal done,”  Alan Schankel , managing
director of  Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott LLC,
which oversees $12 billion in fixed-income securities, said in
an e-mail today. Janney isn’t underwriting the deal.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for  Goldman Sachs Group Inc .,
the senior manager of the deal, declined comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
