Brazil’s real gained for a seventh
day, reaching the strongest level in seven weeks, on speculation
the nation’s companies and rising interest rates will lure more
foreign capital.  The real appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.6698 per dollar at
7:07 a.m. New York time, from 1.6749 yesterday. It reached
1.6686, the strongest intraday level since Oct. 18. The currency
extended the longest winning streak since April.  BTG Pactual, the Brazilian bank controlled by billionaire
 Andre Esteves , said yesterday it agreed to sell a $1.8 billion
stake to a group of investors including the Rothschild and
Agnelli families as well as Middle East and Asia funds. That,
and the prospect of a higher  Selic  rate next year, is boosting
speculation that dollar inflows will accelerate, said  Francisco Carvalho , a director at BGC Liquidez, the second-biggest
brokerage dealing with dollars on the Sao Paulo exchange.  Brazil may take additional measures to stem gains of its
currency if the Group of 20 nations are unable to find a way out
of the global currency war, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said
yesterday.  “It’s not for nothing that Mantega is talking about
foreign-exchange measures,” Carvalho said by phone today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
