New Zealand’s government selected
Telecom Corp. and  Vodafone Group Plc  as partners to build a
broadband Internet network across  New Zealand ’s rural areas.  Commercial negotiations with the two companies have begun
and are likely to be concluded by the end of March, Wellington-
based Communications Minister Steven Joyce said today in an e-
mailed statement. The contract is worth about NZ$285 million
($219 million), Joyce said in November.  Telecom, New Zealand’s biggest telephone company, and
Vodafone submitted a joint bid to join the government’s Rural
Broadband Initiative, which seeks to provide broadband to 95
percent of rural schools and 80 percent of rural homes within
six years. Two other bidders were shortlisted in December.  “The joint proposal was the only one that increases mobile
coverage,” Joyce said.  “A successful project would include
Telecom and Vodafone looking to use existing infrastructure
where they can. I also expect to see affordable wholesale and
retail prices from this investment.”  Telecom and Vodafone said Nov. 12 that they plan to combine
their resources by extending Telecom’s existing cable
infrastructure and Vodafone’s wireless network.  Joyce said their bid involves extending Telecom’s fiber
network  to deliver broadband to 252,000 rural customers. It
also includes construction of 154 cell towers to improve mobile
coverage in country areas and the direct connection of 719 rural
schools to fiber networks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
