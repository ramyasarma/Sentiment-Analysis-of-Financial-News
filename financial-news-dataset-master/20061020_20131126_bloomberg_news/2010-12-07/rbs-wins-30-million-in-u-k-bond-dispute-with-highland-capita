Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , the
lender majority-owned by the U.K., was awarded around 19 million
pounds ($30 million) in a dispute with affiliates of Highland
Capital Management LP over a failed bond transaction.  Justice  Michael Burton  at the High Court in London decided
the case today, ruling solely on the amount. Burton in June
ruled in favor of the bank’s interpretation of its agreement
with Dallas-based Highland over a collateralized debt obligation
which failed to close “because of the collapse of the financial
markets in the latter part of 2008,” according to the ruling.  At a hearing in September, RBS said Highland should cover a
shortfall of about 40 million euros ($53 million), which it says
is the difference between the value of the portfolio of loans
acquired for the CDO and the outstanding amount of the financing
RBS provided to buy them.  A call to a Highland spokesman in New York before normal
business hours wasn’t immediately returned.  The case is: The Royal Bank of Scotland v. Highland
