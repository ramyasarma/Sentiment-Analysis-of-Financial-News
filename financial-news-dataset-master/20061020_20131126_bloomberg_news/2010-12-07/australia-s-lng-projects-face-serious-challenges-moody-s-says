Australia’s liquefied natural gas
industry faces “serious challenges” such as labor shortages
that may force energy companies to delay, merge or cancel their
projects, Moody’s Investors Service said.  Moody’s cited  Woodside Petroleum Ltd.’s  announcement on
Nov. 30 that its Pluto LNG venture would cost A$900 million
($889 million) more and start about six months later than
previously forecast. The increased cost “is symptomatic of
Australia’s resource boom,” Saranga Ranasinghe and Ian Lewis,
analysts at Moody’s, wrote in a report dated yesterday.  “While credit negative for Woodside, the cost overruns at
Pluto also hold negative implications for the rest of
Australia’s energy industry,” and its A$150 billion of proposed
investments, the Sydney-based Moody’s analysts said.  Woodside,  Chevron Corp. , BG Group Plc, Santos Ltd., Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips are among energy producers
facing a contest for skilled workers and customers as they
advance with Australian LNG ventures targeting Asian demand. The
Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association has
estimated the nation has A$200 billion of LNG and coal seam gas
projects planned.  “These are serious challenges,” the report said. “While
we have a favorable view of the long-term LNG demand, these
operating challenges will mean that some of Australia’s planned
LNG projects will not proceed as currently anticipated. Whether
that will lead to the merger of some projects, or to their
outright cancellation, remains to be seen,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
