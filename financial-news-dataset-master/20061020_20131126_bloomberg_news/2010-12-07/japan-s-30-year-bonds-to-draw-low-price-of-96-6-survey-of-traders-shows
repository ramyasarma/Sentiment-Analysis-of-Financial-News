Japan’s sale of 600 billion yen
($7.28 billion) in 30-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted
price of 96.6, according to the median forecast of 13 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 2 percent
bonds ranged from 96.75 to 96, according to the survey. Four
traders said 96.6 and two each said 96.5 and 96.4. One each
reported 96.75, 96.7, 96.65, 96.55, and 96.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
announce the results at 12:45 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
