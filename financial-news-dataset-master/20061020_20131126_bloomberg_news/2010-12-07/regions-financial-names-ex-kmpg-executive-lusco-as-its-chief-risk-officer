Regions Financial Corp. , the Alabama
bank downgraded to junk status by Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services last month, named  Matthew Lusco  senior executive vice
president and chief risk officer.  Lusco, 53, was managing partner at KPMG LLP’s offices in
Memphis, Tennessee, and Birmingham, where Regions is based. He
worked for Arthur Andersen from 1989 to 2002, and for the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, a federal bank regulatory
agency, from 1986 to 1988, according to a company statement.  Lusco succeeds  Bill Wells , who departed Alabama’s biggest
bank last month with two other officers after Regions’s board
and Chief Executive Officer  Grayson Hall , 53, pressed for
changes because of “slow” progress in improving credit
quality, the bank’s finance chief,  David Turner , said at a Nov.
16 investor conference in New York. The changes weren’t imposed
by regulators, Turner said.  “I look forward to build upon the solid foundation that is
already in place and helping the company return to sustainable
profitability,” Lusco said in the statement.  Regions last reported an annual profit in 2007, and since
the start of last year has written off more than $3 billion in
loans, mostly tied to developers, home builders and mortgage
borrowers in Georgia and Florida. The shares fell 6 cents to
$6.01 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .  To contact the reporter on this story:
