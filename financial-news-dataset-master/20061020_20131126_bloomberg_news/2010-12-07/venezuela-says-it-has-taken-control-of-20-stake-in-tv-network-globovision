Venezuela took control of a company
that holds a 20 percent stake in television network Globovision,
which has been critical of President Hugo Chavez’s regime, a
government statement said today.  Venezuela’s deposit guarantee fund took administrative
control of Sindicato Avila, C.A., one of the companies that make
up Corpomedios GV Inversiones, which owns Globovision, according
to a resolution published in the Official Gazette yesterday. The
deposit guarantee fund will be able to claim dividends and
attend shareholder meetings, the statement said.  Globovision’s principal owners, Guillermo Zuloaga and
Nelson Mezerhane, are both in the U.S. after arrest warrants
were filed in Venezuela against them. Mezerhane, whose Banco
Federal CA and other companies were seized by the government, is
accused of fleeing with clients’ deposits and Zuloaga faces
usury allegations for hoarding new vehicles at his Caracas
residence, according to the Attorney General. Both men have
denied any wrongdoing.  Chavez on Nov. 21 said he would “take actions” against
Globovision if Zuloaga doesn’t return to face legal charges.  “Sindicato Avila, C.A. owns only 20 percent of
Corpomedios’ shares, a percentage that doesn’t give it the
ability to assign board members or to influence its
management,” Globovision said in a statement posted on its
website today. Calls to the network by Bloomberg weren’t
answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
