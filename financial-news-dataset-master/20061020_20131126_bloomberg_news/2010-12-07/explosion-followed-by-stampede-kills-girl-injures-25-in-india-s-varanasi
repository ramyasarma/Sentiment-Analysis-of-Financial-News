An explosion followed by a stampede
in the north Indian city of Varanasi killed a 2-year old girl
and injured about 25 people, the Times Now television channel
reported, citing government officials.  The blast at about 6:20 p.m. local time was of low
intensity and its cause was being determined, Home Secretary
Gopal K. Pillai told Times Now. About five people were hurt in
the blast and another 20 in the stampede, Pillai said.  The explosion occurred as pilgrims and tourists gathered
for evening prayers on the banks of the river Ganga, Times Now
said. An Italian national was among the injured, the Press Trust
of India reported, citing Deputy Inspector General of Police
Prem Prakash.  A group called the Indian Mujahideen took responsibility
for the explosion in an e-mail sent to news organizations, the
CNN-IBN television station said. The attack was in response to a
September court verdict that split land disputed by Muslims and
Hindus in the northern town of Ayodhya between the faiths, the
channel said.  The federal government issued a nationwide alert after the
blast, Pillai said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
