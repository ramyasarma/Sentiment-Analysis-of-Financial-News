Eveready East Africa Ltd., a Kenyan
dry-cell battery manufacturer, reported full-year profit fell 69
percent amid increased trade in counterfeit batteries.  Net income fell to 8.7 million shillings ($108,276) in the
12 months to Sept. 30, compared with 28.3 million shillings a
year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in a statement
published in Nairobi-based Daily Nation.  Sales were little changed at 1.64 billion shillings
compared to 1.65 billion shillings a year earlier, it said.  The earnings decline was caused by “illicit dry cells
trade in the country, including sub-standard products and
dumping, which continues to flourish,” the company said.  A 43 percent rise in the average price of zinc and
depreciation of the Kenyan shilling in the second half of the
year led to higher financing costs, Eveready East said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
