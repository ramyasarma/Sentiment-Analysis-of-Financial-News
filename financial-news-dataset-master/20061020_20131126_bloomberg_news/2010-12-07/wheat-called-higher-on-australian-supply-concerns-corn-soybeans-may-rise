What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 9 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange on speculation that demand for
milling-quality grain from the U.S. will increase as rains
damage crops in Australia, said  Greg Grow , the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Corn futures are called to open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on speculation that President Barack Obama
will support extending U.S. ethanol-blending credits for two
years, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 12 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT on bets that rising U.S. government spending and
reduced tax revenue will increase investment in commodities as a
hedge against inflation, Grow said. Soybean-meal futures may
open $2 to $3 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to open up 0.65 cent to 0.75 cent a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
