Asia fuel oil and gasoil swaps
snapped a three-day rising streak as crack spreads narrowed in
Singapore, Asia’s biggest oil-trading center, signaling reduced
processing profit.  Benchmark crude futures fell from a 26-month high above $89
a barrel in New York as traders sold contracts to secure profits
after prices surged 6.5 percent last week.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for January dropped $3.50, or
0.7 percent, to $510.50 a metric ton at 11:45 a.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates, a brokerage.
The product’s  discount  to Dubai crude, the Asian bellwether,
gained 1 cent to $9.05 a barrel, indicating losses from making
the residue remained the most since March 2009.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after rising to $10 a ton, PVM said. This
 viscosity spread  was the widest in three weeks, meaning bunker,
or marine fuel, has risen less than higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  January  gasoil , or diesel, swaps fell 63 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $102.32 a barrel, according to PVM. The premium to
Dubai crude, a measure of refining gains, decreased 9 cents to
$14.73 a barrel. This  crack spread  yesterday reached $14.82, the
widest since January 2009.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was down 5 cents at $1.15 a
barrel, a two-week low, based on PVM data. A narrowing  regrade 
signals it’s less profitable to produce aviation fuel compared
with diesel.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for second-half January delivery were bid at $848.50 a
ton against offers at $851.50, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. That’s little changed from yesterday’s
close of $849, which was the highest since September 2008.  Naphtha’s crack spread to Brent crude added $1.13 to
$161.15 a ton, the highest in a week, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday climbed to $8.30 a
barrel, the strongest since Aug. 6, Bloomberg calculations
showed. A widening  reforming margin  shows motor fuel is more
profitable compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
