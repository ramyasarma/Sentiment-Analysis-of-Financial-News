Ghana’s currency, the cedi, may
strengthen next year as oil production begins at the offshore
Jubilee field, increasing export earnings for the country.  The cedi will trade around 1.44 to the dollar in 2011,
appreciating from today’s rate of 1.458 as of 11:50 a.m. in
Accra, said Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at Barclays Bank
Ghana Ltd., in a phone interview today. The currency has been
little changed against the greenback this year, strengthening
0.6 percent since January.  Ghana’s central bank will allow the currency to strengthen
to 1.37 to the dollar next year in a bid to control inflation,
 Razia Khan , the London-based head of Africa research at Standard
Chartered Plc said in a note to clients Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
