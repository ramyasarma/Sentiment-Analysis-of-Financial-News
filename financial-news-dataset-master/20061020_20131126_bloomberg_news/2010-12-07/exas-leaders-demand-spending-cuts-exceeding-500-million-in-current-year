 Texas Governor  Rick Perry  and two
other state leaders directed agencies to curb spending by as
much as $750 million over the next nine months, citing
“insufficient revenue” to cover costs.  The 2.5 percent reduction is aimed at producing savings of
$500 million to $750 million, said Mike Walz, a spokesman for
Lieutenant Governor  David Dewhurst , who signed a letter to state
officials with Perry and House Speaker  Joe Straus . State revenue
receipts for the year ended Aug. 31 came in $2 billion below
estimates, they noted in the letter, which was dated yesterday.  “Reduced spending in the current fiscal year puts state
government in a better position to prepare for the budget
reductions that will be necessary to balance the budget,”
Perry, Dewhurst and Straus, all Republicans, said in the letter.  A 6 percent increase in sales-tax receipts in September and
October over year-earlier periods won’t make up enough ground to
avoid reduced spending, they said.  Texas has the second-largest state economy behind
California, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. It may
have a budget deficit of more than $15 billion over the next two
years, according to Dewhurst and other officials. The state
gained 172,800 non-farm jobs in the last year, the Texas Labor
Department said Nov. 19. The 8.1 percent October unemployment
rate was the lowest of 2010, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
