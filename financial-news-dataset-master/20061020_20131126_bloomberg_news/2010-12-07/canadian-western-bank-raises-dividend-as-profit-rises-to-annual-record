Canadian Western Bank , the country’s
eighth-biggest lender, raised its dividend for the first time
since 2008 after reporting record annual profit.  “We had an outstanding year; it will be hard to repeat
that,” Chief Executive Officer  Larry Pollock , 63, said today in
an interview. “This is about as good as it can get in every
respect.”  The quarterly payout rose by 2 cents, or 18 percent, to 13
cents a share, the Edmonton, Alberta-based bank said today in a
statement. Net income for the period ended Oct. 31 rose 29
percent to C$39.1 million ($39 million), or 48 cents a share,
from $30.4 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier.  Canadian Western has posted 90 consecutive profitable
quarters, the longest current streak among Canadian banks.
Revenue rose 24 percent to C$108.4 million.  Canadian Western said it had adjusted profit of 49 cents a
share, compared with the 48-cent estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Canadian Western rose C$1.07, or 4 percent, to C$28.19 by
the 4 p.m. close of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the
highest since February 2008. The stock has risen 28 percent this
year, outpacing the 5.8 percent increase of the 10-company
 S&P/TSX Banks Index .  The bank posted record annual profit of C$163.6 million,
surpassing last year’s record profit of C$106.3 million.  Laurentian Bank of Canada , the last Canadian bank to
release fourth-quarter earnings, is scheduled to report results
tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
