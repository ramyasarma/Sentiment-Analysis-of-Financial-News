Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index  advanced for
a sixth day, adding 0.2 percent to 1,935.04, the highest since
Match 2008, by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis.  Kenya’s  All-Share Index  fell 0.3 percent to 78.59 by the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi, and the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index  slipped for a third day, decreasing 0.6 percent to
24,638.17 by the 2.30 p.m. close in Lagos, according to figures
on the exchange’s website.  Namibia’s  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index  increased for a fifth
day to advance 0.1 percent to 843.93 by the 5 p.m. close in
Windhoek and the  Ghana Stock Exchange All-Share Index  rose 0.3
percent to 6,993.67 by the 1 p.m. close in Accra.  The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Sasini Ltd.  (STCL KN), a Kenyan tea and coffee producer,
rose 0.4 percent to 13 shillings by 3 p.m. in Nairobi, after
India said tea output declined in October.  The company expects “good results due to the good weather
conditions, lower global tea output and tea prices edging up,”
Vimal Parmar, an analyst at Kestrel Capital East Africa, said in
a telephone interview.  Unilever Ghana Ltd.  (UNIL GN), a maker of household goods,
climbed to the highest on record, advancing 9 pesewas, or 1.6
percent, to 5.70 cedis by 1 p.m. in Accra.  Estimated economic expansion of more than 12 percent next
year is expected to increase consumer demand for the company’s
soap, toothpaste, and food brands, Hilary Lomotey, an analyst at
Renaissance Capital in Accra, said by phone.  Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd.  (GCB GN), the West African
nation’s biggest lender, surged 27 pesewas, or 12 percent, to
2.60 cedis, the highest since at least February 1997, by the 1
p.m. close in Accra.  Investors expect the start of Ghana oil production next
week will boost lending and deposits, Emmanuel Tsigbey, a stock
broker with Renaissance Capital, said by phone. The bank’s
profits will increase by at least 15 percent this year, he said.  Nigerian Bottling Co. Plc  (NBC NL), which bottles Coca-Cola
products in Africa’s most populous nation, advanced 1.50 naira,
or the maximum 5 percent daily limit allowed by the bourse, to
31.50 naira, its biggest jump since Oct. 29.  Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co.  (EEEK GA), which controls
NBC, wants to buy back the Nigerian company’s stock because it
says the shares should be priced higher, Esili Eigbe, a Lagos-
based analyst with Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, said by phone. “That
is enticing other investors to buy the stock,” Eigbe said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
