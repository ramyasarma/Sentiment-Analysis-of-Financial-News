Flights by Finnair Oyj, Finland’s
biggest airline, may be hampered more today than so far during
the seven days of the cabin crew strike after transport unions
began support action.  Fuel deliveries to Finnair aircraft ended at 6 a.m. local
time this morning and international mail won’t be sorted at the
Helsinki-Vantaa airport, Finnish Transport Workers’ Union said
on its website today. No extra trains will be driven to northern
Finland, the union said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
