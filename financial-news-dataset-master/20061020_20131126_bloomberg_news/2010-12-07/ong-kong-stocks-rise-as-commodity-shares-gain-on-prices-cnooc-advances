Hong Kong  stocks  advanced for the
first time in three days as shares of raw material producers
rose after commodity prices increased yesterday and gold climbed
to a record.  Cnooc Ltd. , China’s biggest offshore oil producer, rose 1.1
percent.  Zijin Mining Group Co. , China’s largest gold producer,
advanced 4.1 percent.  Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. ,
a China-based maker of wind turbines, surged 7.6 percent after
winning 5.7 billion yuan ($857.5 million) of supply contracts in
China.  Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. , the world’s No. 1
contract maker of mobile phones, climbed 3 percent after
President  Barack Obama  said he’ll agree to Bush-era tax cuts.  “Obama extending tax cuts should help support the economic
recovery,” said  Terrace Chum , who helps manage about $6 billion
at MFC Global Investment Management in Hong Kong. “Investors
are still mindful of policy tightening for China. That will set
the tone for the market.”  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.8 percent to
23,428.15 as of the 4 p.m. local time close, erasing losses of
as much as 0.6 percent earlier. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese companies rose 0.9
percent to 12,922.24.  The Hang Seng Index has increased 7.1 percent this year, on
expectations that growth in corporate earnings will overcome
concerns about the pace of the U.S. economic recovery and
China’s steps to curb rising property prices. Shares in the
gauge trade at an average 14.7 times estimated earnings,
compared with about 17.2 times at the start of the year.  U.S. Tax Cuts  Shares of raw material producers advanced after crude oil
for January delivery rose 0.2 percent to settle at $89.38 a
barrel in New York yesterday on speculation the U.S. may extend
stimulus measures, bolstering fuel demand in the world’s largest
oil-consuming country. Copper futures climbed 0.5 percent in
London yesterday, while gold rose to an all-time high of
$1,427.55 an ounce in New York.  Cnooc increased 1.1 percent to HK$18.36.  Jiangxi Copper Co. ,
China’s biggest producer of the metal increased 2.4 percent to
HK$25.25.  Zijin Mining  jumped 4.1 percent to HK$7.59. Real Gold
Mining Ltd. gained 2.2 percent to HK$14.94.  Xinjiang Goldwind surged 7.6 percent to HK$18.34. The
company said it won contracts valued at 920.1 million yuan to
supply wind-turbine electricity generators to China Three Gorges
New Energy Corp. That’s in addition to contracts worth 4.77
billion yuan for eight other wind-turbine projects in China.  Exporters Climb  Exporters advanced after Obama said he would accept a lower
rate for the estate tax than Democrats wanted in order to break
a stalemate over extending the George W. Bush administration’s
tax cuts before Congress adjourns. The current tax rates,
enacted in 2001 and 2003, are set to expire Dec. 31. “This
compromise is an essential step on the road to recovery,” Obama
said.  Foxconn increased 3 percent to HK$5.77.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. ,
Asia’s third-largest container-terminal operator, jumped 3.9
percent to HK$13.30.  “Valuations have become attractive following the decline
in November,” said  Castor Pang , Hong Kong-based research
director at Cinda International Holdings Ltd. “Prospects of
further quantitative easing in the U.S. and tax cuts in the U.S.
are positive for Hong Kong stocks.”  Tsingtao Brewery Co. , the Chinese beer company founded by
German settlers more than a century ago, advanced 5 percent to
HK$42.95. The company said it will acquire Shandong Xin Immense
Brewery Co. for 1.87 billion yuan.  Hong Kong Rents  Commercial property landlords in Hong Kong gained amid
prospects of rising rents in the Chinese city. Prime office
rents will rise as much as 35 percent in 2011 because of
increased demand and limited supply, Gavin Morgan, head of
markets at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. said at a media briefing
today.  Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. , the owner of Times Square and
Harbour City shopping malls and office complexes in the city,
surged 5.8 percent to HK$58. Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., the
world’s biggest developer by market value, gained 1.5 percent to
HK$131.50.  Three stocks advanced for each that fell in the 45-company
Hang Seng Index. Futures on the gauge climbed 1.2 percent to
23,459.  To contact the reporter on this story:
