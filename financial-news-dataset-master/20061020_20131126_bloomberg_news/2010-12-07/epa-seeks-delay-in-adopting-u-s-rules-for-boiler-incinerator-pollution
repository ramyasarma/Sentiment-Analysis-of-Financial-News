The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency today sought additional time for issuing rules to cut air
emissions linked to illnesses from boilers and solid-waste
incinerators.  The agency asked the U.S. District Court in Washington for
an extension of a court-set deadline to consider information
received after the rules were proposed in April, the agency said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The EPA’s rules would reduce emissions of pollutants such
as mercury and soot that cause developmental disabilities in
children and cancer, heart disease and premature death, the
agency said in the statement.  “We’re encouraged that EPA is taking the time needed to
develop an effective, achievable final rule,” said  Cal Dooley ,
president of the American Chemistry Council. “Industry has
provided additional data, which EPA can use to develop a
realistic methodology based on real-world facilities,
emissions and impacts. We hope the court grants EPA’s request
for more time to work on these complex regulations that will
affect large industries and small businesses across the
country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
