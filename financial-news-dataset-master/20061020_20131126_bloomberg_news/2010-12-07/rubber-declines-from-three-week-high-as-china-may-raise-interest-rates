Rubber retreated from a three-week
high on speculation that China, the world’s largest consumer,
may raise interest rates to curb inflation, leading to a
slowdown in its economic growth and raw-material demand.  May-delivery rubber on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange lost as
much as 1.4 percent to 372.8 yen per kilogram ($4,525 a metric
ton) before settling at 376.2 yen. The price retreated after
reaching yesterday the highest level since Nov. 11, when the
most-active contract jumped to a 30-year high of 383 yen.  This weekend may be a “window” for China to raise rates,
the China Securities Journal reported today, citing analysts at
domestic banks and brokerages. Higher borrowing costs may slow
car sales in China, the world’s biggest auto market, said  Takaki Shigemoto , analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  “Concern about China’s rate increase is the biggest drag
on the price of rubber futures,” Shigemoto said today by phone.
“China may take every possible measure to curb prices.”  May-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
dropped as much as 1.8 percent to 32,255 yuan ($4,849) a ton and
closed at 33,225 yuan. The price reached a record 38,920 yuan on
Nov. 11.  China’s central bank may raise rates around the release of
November’s inflation data, scheduled for Dec. 13, the newspaper
reported, citing Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. analyst  Li Huiyong , who forecast consumer prices may rise 5.1 percent last
month.  Lu Zhengwei , an economist at Industrial Bank Co., said a
rate increase is likely between today and Dec. 18, according to
the report.  China’s central bank last month ordered banks to set aside
larger reserves for the second time in two weeks after raising
interest rates in October for the first time since 2007.  Record Thai Price  Losses in futures were limited as the physical rubber price
in Thailand, the biggest producer and exporter, increased to a
record after rain and flooding reduced latex output. The  cash
rubber price  climbed to 135.55 baht ($4.52) per kilogram today,
according to the  Rubber Research Institute of Thailand .  Prices will remain “strong” next year as global rubber
consumption increases faster than supply, according to Pongsak
Kerdvongbundit, managing director of Von Bundit Co., Thailand’s
largest exporter.  Rubber futures have gained 36 percent this year on
increased demand from China and India, the two largest
consumers, as rising incomes boost demand for autos and consumer
goods. Heavy rains and floods in Asian producers including
Thailand have also disrupted tapping and curbed supply.  Global consumption of natural rubber will outstrip supply
by 313,000 tons this year, the most since 2006, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. predicted in a November report, revising its
September outlook for an 82,000-ton deficit.  Goldman Sachs raised its price forecast to $4.40 per
kilogram next year from $3.60, and to $4.60 per kilogram in 2012
from $3.80, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
