Philippine Airlines Inc. said
President Benigno Aquino assigned Executive Secretary Paquito
Ochoa to “broker talks” between management and its workers’
union. The airline, in a statement today, said it wants to
resolve whether the employees association has legal grounds to
hold a strike vote. “All flights continue to operate
normally,” the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
