The New England Patriots’ 45-3
blowout of the New York Jets drew an 11.2 overnight rating on
ESPN, the fourth-highest of the 14 “Monday Night Football”
telecasts this season.  National ratings will be released later today, the Walt
Disney Co. network said.  The best overnight rating for a “Monday Night Football”
game this season was 12.3 for the New York Giants’ Oct. 25 win
over the Dallas Cowboys. That game drew 17.9 million viewers.
The record for a cable television audience is 21.8 million for
 Brett Favre ’s return to Green Bay during a Monday night game in
October 2009.  While the Patriots-Jets matchup marked the fourth time in
40 years that National Football League teams with 9-2 records or
better met on “Monday Night Football”, New England’s win
equaled the second-biggest rout in the program’s history.  Overnight ratings measure the number of viewers in the
biggest U.S. cities. Final national ratings include numbers from
smaller television markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
