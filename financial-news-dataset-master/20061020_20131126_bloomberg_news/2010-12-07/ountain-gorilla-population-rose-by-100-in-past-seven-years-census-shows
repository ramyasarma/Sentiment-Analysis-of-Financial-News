The number of mountain gorillas
living in the wild rose by 100 in the past seven years,
according to preliminary results of a census by Rwanda,
Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.  There were 480 alive as of April, according to a statement
released today by a secretariat on gorillas established by
conservation authorities from the three countries in the Rwandan
capital, Kigali.  The endangered primates are found in  Rwanda ’s Volcanoes
national park, the  Virunga  park in Congo and the Mgahinga and
Bwindi parks in Uganda. The principal threats to the gorilla
population is disease and poaching, where gorillas end up in
traps set for other animals.  “It is in rare cases that poachers target gorillas,
because they are rare species and can be traced back,” Tom
Sengalama, head of the secretariat, said in the statement.  The total world population, including those in captivity,
is 786 individuals, according to the statement.  Gorillas are the leading attraction in Rwanda’s tourism, a
sector expected to generate $187 million this year, according to
the Tourism Board. Tourism is Rwanda’s biggest earner of foreign
exchange, according to government information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
