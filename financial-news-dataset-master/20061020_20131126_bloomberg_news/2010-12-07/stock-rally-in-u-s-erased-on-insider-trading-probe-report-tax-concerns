U.S.  stocks  erased gains in the final
hour of trading, pulling the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  down
from a two-year high, after a probe of insider trading
reportedly widened and President Barack Obama said he’ll push to
overhaul the tax code in two years.  3M Co., Hewlett-Packard Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. lost
at least 1.5 percent for the biggest declines in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average as the 30-stock gauge erased an 89-point
rally.  The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to 1,223.78 at 4 p.m. in New
York after surging 1 percent earlier. The Dow lost 3.03 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 11,359.16.  “It all happened at the same time, taking the market off
its highs,” said Michael Nasto, senior trader at U.S. Global
Investors Inc., which manages about $2.5 billion in San Antonio.
“Investors got a little spooked during Obama’s press
conference,” he said. “Then, we had news that the SEC may
widen the insider trading probe. That took some wind out of
stocks.”  Earlier gains came after Obama agreed to extend tax cuts
and the Treasury sold its remaining stake in Citigroup Inc. The
market retreated in the final hour after Reuters reported that
federal authorities have issued more than a dozen subpoeanas to
hedge funds and investment firms as part of an investigation of
insider trading. The news service cited people familiar with the
inquiry.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
