A Vienna court convicted an Austrian
businessman of having bought luxury cars, yachts, pianos and
other embargoed goods for North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il ,
Austrian daily newspaper Kurier reported today.  The man, who was not identified by Kurier, bought items
including eight  Daimler AG  Mercedes-Benz  S-Class  cars, two
yachts and a  Steinway  grand piano, Kurier reported, citing
state prosecutor Michael Schoen.  The man received a suspended sentence of nine months and
was fined 3.3 million euros ($4.4 million). This was the amount
of a down payment he had received for the yachts, according to
the report.  The payment aroused suspicions at the man’s Vienna-based
bank because it came directly from North Korea rather than via
Chinese front companies which had been used in other deals,
Kurier said. The verdict is final.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
