European Central Bank Executive Board
member  Juergen Stark  said he’s not in favor of a joint issuance
of bonds in the euro region.  “Every state must be liable for its own debt,” Stark was
quoted as saying in an interview with  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  today
when asked about his position on Eurobonds. “We’re definitely
not on the way into a transfer union” where the euro region
takes responsibility for fiscal problems in single member
states, Stark added.  Stark said it’s the task of governments to solve the
current sovereign debt crisis and not the business of the ECB,
Sueddeutsche reported. “We’re not there to finance states,” he
was quoted as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
