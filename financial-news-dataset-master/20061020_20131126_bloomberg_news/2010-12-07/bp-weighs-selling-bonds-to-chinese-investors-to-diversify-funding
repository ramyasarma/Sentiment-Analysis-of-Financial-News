BP Plc , which is facing a bill for as
much as $40 billion for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, is
considering selling bonds aimed at Chinese investors as it
diversifies its funding sources.  BP may issue debt in yuan as well as yen and Australian
and Canadian dollars, according to  Gary Admans , the London-based
company’s manager of debt capital markets. He was speaking at
Euromoney’s Corporate Financing Forum 2010 in Paris today.  The company has sold bonds in the Japanese and Australian
currencies before, the most recent being an A$325 million ($433
million) issue of 6 percent five-year notes on March 3,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BP last issued debt in
October, with a 1 billion-euro sale of 3.83 percent notes due in
2017.  BP is selling assets to meet the costs of the crude oil
spill at its Macondo well on April 20, which cost Chief
Executive Officer  Tony Hayward  his job. The company agreed last
month to sell its 60 percent interest in Pan American Energy to
Argentinean oil and gas company Bridas Corp. for $7.06 billion,
taking its asset sales this year to about $21 billion.  BP rose to the highest since May 28 today, climbing as much
as 2.4 percent to 461 pence in London.  The stock  is still down
30 percent since the accident.  The cost of protecting BP’s debt using credit-default swaps
surged more than 13-fold in the wake of the crisis and is now
about twice as high as at the time of the accident, at 97 basis
points, according to CMA.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
