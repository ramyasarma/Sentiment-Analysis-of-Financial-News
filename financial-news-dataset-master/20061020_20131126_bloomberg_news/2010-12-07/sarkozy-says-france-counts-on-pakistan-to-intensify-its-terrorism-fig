French President Nicolas Sarkozy said
he is counting on Pakistan to intensify its fight against
terrorists. Sarkozy was speaking at Mumbai’s Oberoi-Trident
hotel, attacked by Pakistan-based militants in 2008.  “I am counting on all Pakistani authorities to intensify
their efforts and show resolution” in fighting terror and
“groups trained on its soil,” Sarkozy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
