European Central Bank Executive Board
Member  Juergen Stark  said every euro member country must vouch
for their own debt, Market News International reported, citing
an interview in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.  The comment was in response to whether Stark was in favor
of a proposed common euro-zone bond, according to the report
from the German newspaper. Stark said the trading bloc is not on
its way to becoming a transfer union and is not in danger of a
currency crisis, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
