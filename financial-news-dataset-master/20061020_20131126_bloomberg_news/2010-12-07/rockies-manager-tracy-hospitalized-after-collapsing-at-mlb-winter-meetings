Colorado Rockies manager  Jim Tracy 
collapsed early today while attending Major League Baseball’s
winter meetings and was taken to a Florida hospital.  Tracy, who will turn 55 on New Year’s Eve, is resting
comfortably while being evaluated,  Jay Alves , a spokesman for
the Rockies, said in an e-mail.  Tracy was with the Rockies’ coaches at the Walt Disney
World Swan & Dolphin Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, when
he collapsed near a set of elevators,  MLB.com said . He was
conscious and responsive while attended to by emergency
personnel and was eventually taken out of the hotel on a
stretcher, the website said.  Tracy, the National League’s Manager of the Year in 2009,
has been the Rockies’ manager since that May, posting a 157-121
record. He also managed the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2001-2005
and the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2006 and 2007, and has a 719-693
career record.  In April, Rockies President  Keli McGregor  died in a hotel
room at the age of 48 because of what was later determined to be
a virus that infected his healthy heart.  To contact the reporter on this story:
