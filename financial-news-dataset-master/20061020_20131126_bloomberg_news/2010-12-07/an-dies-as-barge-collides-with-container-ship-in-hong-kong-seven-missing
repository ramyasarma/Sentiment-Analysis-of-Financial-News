Hong Kong rescuers found a second
body after a sand barge capsized following a collision with a
container vessel. Six sailors are still missing.  “We will continue our search for the missing sailors,
although seas are rough,” Chung Siu-man, an assistant director
at the marine department, said in a press briefing today. The
second body was found at 12:23 p.m., about nine hours after the
ships collided.  Six other crewmembers were rescued from the vessel,
including one who is hospitalized in stable condition, Chung
said. Police boats and government helicopters began the rescue
operations after the barge capsized and sank near the city’s
Tung Lung Chau  island .  The container ship is moored, and its nine crewmembers are
safe, the government said in a statement today. The vessel, the
HuijinqiaoO8, is about 50 meters (164 feet) long, Chung said.
Both the container ship and the Runze001 sand barge are from
China, he said.  The incident didn’t affect operations at the nearby Chai
Wan harbor, said Patrick Wong, a marine department spokesman.
Hong Kong’s port, the world’s third-busiest for container
traffic, was used by 205,510 ships last year, according to the
Hong Kong Port Development Council’s  website .  The government is investigating the collision, Chung said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
