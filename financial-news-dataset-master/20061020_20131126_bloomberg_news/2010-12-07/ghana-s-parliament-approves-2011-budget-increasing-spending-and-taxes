Ghana’s parliament today approved the
West African nation’s 2011 budget, which includes a 14.6 percent
increase in spending and higher taxes on goods ranging from
chickens to airline tickets.  The parliament, controlled by President  John Atta Mills ’
National Democratic Party, didn’t amend the budget proposed by
Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  on Nov. 25, Emmanuel Ladzagla,
a clerk at the parliament, said in a phone interview today.  The Finance Ministry projects oil revenue of 584 million
cedis ($401 million) in 2011. About half of that will be
channeled to the state-run Ghana National Petroleum Corp. Ghana
is due to begin pumping oil from its offshore Jubilee field on
Dec. 15.  Parliament is expected to continue debate on an oil revenue
bill tomorrow, Ladzagla said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
