Hong Kong police were searching for a
man who was seen running away from the scene of one of three
suspected arson attacks in the city’s Kowloon district in which
seven people, including a fireman, were injured, Radio
Television Hong Kong reported.  The first blaze erupted after garbage was ignited near the
Prince Edward railway station, the report said. About 15 minutes
later a blaze broke out among hawker stalls on Fa Yuen Street,
while the third incident took place in a lane near Sai Yeubg
Choi Street North, where rubble was set alight, RTHK said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
