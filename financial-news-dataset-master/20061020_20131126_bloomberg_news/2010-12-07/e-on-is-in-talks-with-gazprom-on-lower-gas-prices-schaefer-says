E.ON AG , the German utility that
agreed to sell its stake in OAO Gazprom, said it is in talks
with the Russian natural-gas producer on lower prices.  “Contracts with suppliers need adjusting,” said  Klaus Schaefer , chief executive officer of E.ON’s Ruhrgas natural gas
unit, at a press conference at the unit’s headquarter in Essen,
Germany. He declined to provide details of the talks with
Gazprom or say whether the company was in negotiations with
other suppliers.  E.ON Ruhrgas gets 29 percent of its gas from Russia, its
biggest provider. The price for the commodity has declined as
much as 70 percent in the past two years at the National
Balancing Point, Europe’s most important hub, Schaefer said.  Cooperation with Gazprom will remain unchanged after the
stake sale, Schaefer said. Russia’s state development bank VEB
will buy 2.7 percent of E.ON’s Gazprom shares while the rest has
been sold on the open market, the German utility said Dec. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
