The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  held
at its 50-day moving average during its November decline, a sign
that U.S. stocks have the momentum to climb further, Katie
Stockton of MKM Partners said.  After sinking below its average price from the past 50 days
on an intraday basis during the last two days of November, the
S&P 500 closed above that threshold, then rose 3.7 percent in
the next three days,  Bloomberg data  shows. The index now may
climb to the next level of resistance at 1,315, Stockton said.  The rebounds from the 50-day average prompted speculation
last week among technical analysts, who base forecasts on chart
patterns, that the S&P 500 would avoid the kind of drop it
suffered after it breached the threshold in May and fell as much
as 12 percent. Stockton’s projection would take the index to a
level last hit in August 2008, the month before Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy, and represents 7.5 percent gain from
yesterday’s close.  The S&P 500 “discovered support at its 50-day moving
average in what we view to be a testament to the positive
momentum supporting its uptrend,” Stockton said in a note dated
Dec. 5. “Only short-term momentum wavered during the pullback,
while intermediate-term momentum remained strongly positive.
This increases the likelihood of a decisive breakout to a new
recovery high before year-end.”  The benchmark has rallied 20 percent since its 2010 low in
July as  corporate profits  improved and the Federal Reserve
expanded its asset-purchase program to suppress interest rates
and stoke the economic recovery.  The S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent to 1,232.92 at 9:53 a.m. in
New York.  To contact the reporter on this story;
