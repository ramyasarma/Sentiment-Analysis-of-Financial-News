Copper rose to a 31-month high in New
York and reached a record in London on speculation that an
extension of U.S. tax cuts will help bolster the economy,
increasing demand for the industrial metal.  President  Barack Obama  said he’ll agree to extend all Bush-
era tax cuts by two years. Ireland’s austerity measures helped
ease concern Europe’s debt crisis will spread. Copper also
gained as China’s benchmark money-market rate fell the most in
three years and inventories tracked by the London Metal Exchange
shrank further.  “Prices are up again today as favorable messages
surrounding stimulus in the U.S. and continued demand in China
emerge,”  John Meyer , an analyst at Fairfax IS, said in a
report.  Copper for March delivery added 4.15 cents, or 1 percent,
to settle at $4.0495 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices reached $4.1315, the highest level since May 5,
2008, when they touched a record $4.2605.  On the LME, copper for three-month delivery climbed as high
as $9,044 a metric ton, surpassing the previous peak of $8,966
on Nov. 11. The contract rose $110.50, or 1.3 percent, to $8,880
a ton.  Record Open Interest  Open interest in LME copper, or futures outstanding, rose
to a record 310,740 contracts yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The recent trend of rising open interest and higher
prices suggests that the addition of new long positions has been
the main driver of the latest move,”  Leon Westgate , a London-
based analyst at Standard Bank Plc, wrote in a report today.
Some traders have also been buying contracts to close out wagers
on declines, “exacerbating some of the price action,” he said.  Copper stockpiles in LME warehouses have shrunk 30 percent
this year, dropping today to 351,375 tons, the lowest level
since October 2009, exchange  data  show. Inventories monitored by
the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell last week for the second
straight time.  Demand will outpace supply by 367,500 tons next year,
enough for wires, pipes and appliances in about 1.8 million U.S.
homes, according to the median forecast of 12 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Stockpiles may drop to an all-time low of less
than one week’s usage, according to  Michael Widmer , a London-
based metals analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Rising Demand  Demand for copper, used in everything from smart phones to
brake pads, will increase 4.2 percent next year, compared with a
2.6 percent gain in  production , Barclays Capital said in a
report Nov. 11. Supplies fell 363,000 tons short of demand in
the first eight months of this year, the International Copper
Study Group said Nov. 23.  Mining companies have failed to keep pace with demand
because new reserves are harder to find and the quality of ore
is declining, meaning less metal is extracted from each ton of
earth. Average grades declined to about 1.1 percent this year
from 1.6 percent in 1990, according to Guildford, England-based
researcher Brook Hunt, a Wood Mackenzie company.  The potential for exchange-traded products has helped the
rally. ETF Securities Ltd., BlackRock Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. have said they plan to start funds backed by the metal. ETF
Securities said today it will introduce ETPs backed by copper,
tin and nickel on Dec. 10.  One unidentified company held between 50 percent and 79
percent of LME copper stockpiles from Nov. 22 to Dec. 2,
exchange data show. Buyers on Dec. 1 paid $74 a ton, the largest
premium in two years, for immediate supply relative to the
three-month contract. The gap was last at $50.  Aluminum was unchanged on the LME. Lead, nickel and zinc
rose, while tin fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
