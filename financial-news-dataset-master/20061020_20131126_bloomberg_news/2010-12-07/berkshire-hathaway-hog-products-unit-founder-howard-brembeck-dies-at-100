Howard S. Brembeck, who founded the
livestock and farming equipment maker that was bought by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , has died. He was 100.  Brembeck died on Dec. 5, CTB Inc., the company he
established in 1976, said today in a  statement  on its website.
Brembeck retired from the Milford, Indiana-based firm in 1995.  Buffett said last year in an address to CTB employees that
his 2002 acquisition of the unit was “a lucky day” for Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire. The company paid about $177 million
for CTB, according to Bloomberg data, and Buffett bankrolled the
unit’s expansion through at least six acquisitions, including
the purchase of Porcon group of Deurne, the Netherlands.
Buffett, 80, has pledged support for the firm’s expansion.  “We’ll hit a bump in the road every now and then but we’re
looking at a superhighway out there in front of us,” Buffett
told CTB staff in a  video  posted on the CTB website.  Brembeck began selling equipment for poultry and livestock
farmers through Chore-Time, a CTB predecessor, in 1952,
according to the company. He later added storage bins for
commercial grains to his offerings. CTB’s hog products include
pig feeders and ventilation fans.  “Howard created a legacy of innovation” said Victor
Mancinelli, president and chief executive officer of CTB, in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
