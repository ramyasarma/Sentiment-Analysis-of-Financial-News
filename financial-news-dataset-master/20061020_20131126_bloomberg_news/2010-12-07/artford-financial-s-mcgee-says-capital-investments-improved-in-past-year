Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. , the life and property-casualty insurer, said investments
gained this year after stock and bond markets advanced.  “Our capital position is strong and has improved in
2010,” Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee  said today at a
conference hosted by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  McGee, hired last year to halt  losses  that Hartford
accumulated during the financial crisis, posted its biggest net
income in three years in the third quarter. Results at Hartford,
which is based in the Connecticut city of the same name, have
been helped by the 10 percent rally in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index this year.  Hartford has gained about 5 percent since Dec. 31,  less
than  the 18 percent gain in the 24-company KBW Insurance Index.  Hartford has scaled back business outside the U.S. and
curbed the sale of variable annuities, the equity-based
retirement products that produced losses when  stock markets  fell
in 2008 and early 2009. In March, McGee sold stock and debt to
repay a $3.4 billion U.S. bailout that his predecessor  Ramani Ayer  took last year.  The insurer, which lost more than $4 billion in Ayer’s last
five quarters as CEO, reported net income of $666 million in the
three months ended Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
