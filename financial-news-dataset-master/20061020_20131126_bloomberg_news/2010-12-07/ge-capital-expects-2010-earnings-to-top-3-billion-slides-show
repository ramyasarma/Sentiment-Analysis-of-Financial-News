GE Capital earnings this year may
climb to about $3 billion, more than managers projected, as
delinquencies slow and the unit gains market share in key
businesses such as mid-market lending, the unit’s chief said.  Profit should rise next year and in 2012 after this year’s
increase, which includes tax gains, said  Michael Neal , chief
executive officer of  General Electric Co.’s  finance division. GE
Capital’s profit last year was $1.7 billion, down from $8.6
billion in 2008, amid the height of the financial crisis.  GE Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  is shrinking the
percentage that the finance business contributes to the
Fairfield, Connecticut-based parent company’s profit and sales.
GE Capital is focusing on areas it dominates, such as lending to
small and mid-sized companies and aircraft-industry leasing.  “We’ll be smaller and more focused but more profitable,”
Neal, who is also a vice chairman of the parent company, said
during a  presentation  for investors broadcast on the Internet.  Consumer businesses should make up 15 percent to 20 percent
of the portfolio going forward, he told investors. Real estate
assets will shrink to 10 percent to 15 percent from 16 percent
this year and so-called middle-market leasing and lending may
reach 50 percent, up from about one-third in 2010.  GE Capital’s ability to build businesses in markets such as
commercial lending and leasing after the financial crisis gives
it an edge, especially as the company’s prospects improve, Neal
said. Losses absorbed by the division this year should be about
 $10.6 billion , down from $12.6 billion in 2009.  Garanti Bankasi  GE rose 33 cents, or 2 percent, to $17.03 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange Composite  trading . The shares have
gained 13 percent this year.  GE Capital’s $2 billion of 2.25 percent notes due in
November 2015 fell 0.64 cent to 96.32 cents on the dollar at
5:15 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The finance division is shedding smaller units in far-flung
areas of the globe and exiting joint-venture stakes where it
doesn’t make sense to stay. An agreement to sell an 18.6 percent
stake in Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria for $3.78 billion last month may yield a gain of $300
to $400 million and slice about $2.7 billion in assets, GE Chief
Operating Officer  Bill Cary  said in November.  Cary said about $17 billion in assets will be sold in 2011.
The division sold about $14 billion in assets this year.  Cash Balance  GE aims to reduce its ending net investment in finance
assets, a measure used by analysts to gauge the division’s size,
to $440 billion by the end of 2012 from about  $489 billion  at
the end of the third quarter, Neal said.  GE Capital expects an ending cash balance of about $60
billion this year, $60 billion to $70 billion in 2011 and $50
billion to $60 billion in 2012 as it pays off maturing debt
issued under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program. After that year, cash balances
should be about $40 billion to $45 billion annually, the company
said.  The division still plans to resume in 2012 an internal
dividend payment to the parent company suspended in the midst of
the financial crisis, Neal said, calling the plan “prudent” as
maturities are paid off and regulations are firmed up.  In real estate, unrealized losses should be $5 billion to
$5.5 billion, down from last year’s peak of about $7 billion,
the company said. The company plans to make the real estate
segment’s mix of businesses more conservative as it shrinks its
assets.  Dodd-Frank Act  GE Capital shouldn’t need a $2 billion capital injection
next year that GE previously expected to provide, Neal repeated
today.  The company, which will be regulated by the Federal Reserve
under the new Dodd-Frank finance laws, has planned for possible
requirements such as maintaining a tangible common equity ratio
of 7 percent to 9 percent, Neal said.  The measure gauges financial strength based on capital and
retained earnings, excluding intangible assets such as goodwill.
The company should receive more details during the next two
years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
