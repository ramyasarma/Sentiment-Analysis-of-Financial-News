Japanese  stock   futures  gained as the
yen weakened, raising expectations exporters’ earnings will
improve. Australian shares fell after gold prices declined.  American depositary receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s biggest carmaker, gained 0.9 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of Canon Inc., a Japanese camera
maker that earns about 80 percent of its revenue overseas, rose
0.8 percent. Newcrest Mining Ltd., Australia’s largest gold
producer, dropped 0.5 percent in Sydney after gold prices fell.  “The global economy is on track for mild recovery in terms
of fundamentals,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in
Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. “Investors are likely to
buy stocks, led by those of export-related industries, on the
reversal of the yen’s appreciation.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
December closed at 10,200 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,150 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,190 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 0.3 percent in Sydney. New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index gained 0.4 percent in Wellington.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 11 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 9.7 percent by the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 7.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. Shares in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.4
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 14.4 times
for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  Dollar Advances  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.1 percent
today. The index rose 0.1 percent yesterday, after surging 1
percent earlier. U.S. Stocks pared gains in the final hour of
trading, pulling the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down from a
two-year high, after a probe of insider trading reportedly
widened and President Barack Obama said he’ll push to overhaul
the tax code in two years.  The dollar rose against most of its major counterparts as
Treasury yields surged on speculation an agreement to extend tax
cuts will boost the economy, increasing demand for U.S. assets.
The greenback rallied against the euro and the yen after Obama 
broke a stalemate about extending middle-class tax cuts
introduced by the administration of  George W. Bush .  The yen depreciated to as low as 83.55 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 82.51 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened
to 110.81 from 110.11. A weaker yen boosts overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Gold futures for delivery in February fell 0.5 percent in
New York yesterday, the first decline since Nov. 26, as
investors stepped up sales following a six-session rally to a
record. Gold for immediately delivery reached a record $1,431.25.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  slid 0.6 percent  last month 
after two straight monthly gains as concern grew that China’s
anti-inflation measures, Europe’s debt crisis and tensions on
the Korean peninsula will cool the global economic recovery.  To contact the reporters on this story:
