Natural gas futures declined for the
first time in five days on speculation that supplies will be
ample to meet demand for the heating fuel.  U.S. natural gas output will average a record 62.09 billion
cubic feet a day this year, Energy Department  production data 
show. The total, which may be revised next month, was up 1
percent from a November estimate, according to the department’s
 Short-Term Energy Outlook , released today in Washington.  “You’re looking at bigger and bigger storage withdrawals
for the next couple of weeks, but supplies are still very
solid,” said  Jason Schenker , president of Prestige Economics in
Austin, Texas. “The supply expectations could be having an
effect.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 9.5 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $4.393 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas yesterday settled at a
four-month high of $4.488 per million Btu. Prices have dropped
21 percent this year.  Gas inventories may total 1.833 trillion cubic feet at the
end of the winter heating season on March 31, 171 billion above
last year’s level, the Energy Department said today.  The department reported Dec. 2 that 23 billion cubic feet
of gas were withdrawn from storage in the week ended Nov 26,
below the five-year average reduction of 36 billion.  Stockpiles 
totaled 3.814 trillion cubic feet, 10 percent higher than the
five-year average for the week.  Gas Rigs  The number of  rigs  drilling for gas rose by 8 to 961 last
week, according to data published Dec. 3 by Baker Hughes Inc.
The total of oil and natural-gas rigs operating in the U.S.
jumped to a 23-month high, gaining 26 to 1,713, according to
Baker Hughes.  Temperatures may be normal or above-normal across most of
the eastern and central U.S. in January, February and March,
according to the  National Weather Service .  “The underlying fundamentals still paint a bearish
picture,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst at Canaccord Genuity
in Houston. “When you look at the kinds of production growth
we’ve seen over the past few months, you have to project very
high inventories, even numbers that could surpass physical
storage capacity come 2011.”  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, rose for a second day, gaining 0.45 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $4.4788 per million Btu on the Intercontinental
Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
329,664 as of 2:37 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
273,000. Volume was 318,514 yesterday. Open interest was 756,331
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 796,000. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
