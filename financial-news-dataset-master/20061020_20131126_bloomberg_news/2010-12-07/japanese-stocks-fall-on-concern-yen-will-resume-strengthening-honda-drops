Japanese  stocks  declined, sending the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average lower for a second day, on concern the
yen will resume strengthening and hurt exporters’ earnings.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets about 80 percent of
its sales abroad, sank 1.9 percent. Sony Corp., an electronics
maker that earns about 40 percent of its revenue from the U.S.
and Europe, sank 1.2 percent.  Mitsubishi Corp. , Japan’s biggest
commodities trader, rose 0.4 percent after oil and metal prices
advanced.  “People in the market are worried the stronger yen will
hurt exporters’ earnings,” said  Naoteru Teraoka , general
manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $26 billion. “The market has entered into a
small correction.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.3 percent to 10,141.10
as of the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix lost 0.3 percent to
879.10, even with three shares rising for every two that fell.  The  Topix  has tumbled 12 percent from its high this year on
April 15 through yesterday as Europe’s debt crisis, China’s
steps to curb property prices and concern about U.S. economic
growth damped confidence in a global recovery. Stocks in the
index trade at 15.2 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 14.4 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
12.1 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.1 percent yesterday,
snapping a three-day rally, after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the world’s largest economy may need more stimulus.  Automakers Drag  Honda  declined 1.9 percent to 3,075 yen, the heaviest drag
on both the Topix and Nikkei 225. Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s biggest carmaker, slid 0.6 percent to 3,255 yen.
Automakers were the biggest contributor to the Topix’s decline
among its 33 industry groups, followed by electronics makers.  Sony sank 1.2 percent to 2,984 yen. Canon, which earns
about 80 percent of its sales outside of Japan, slid 0.4 percent
to 4,055 yen.  “The yen is strengthening because it’s just relatively no
worse than other currencies,” said Teraoka. “The U.S. recovery
is still uncertain and Europe has various financial issues.”  The yen appreciated to as high as 82.34 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 82.86 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
strengthened to as much as 109.57 from 110.60. A stronger yen
reduces overseas income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency.  “Concerns about the strong yen may weaken exporters,”
said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co.  Commodities Advance  Mitsubishi  rose 0.4 percent to 2,173 yen. Sumitomo Corp.,
Japan’s third-largest trading company, advanced 0.3 percent to
1,174 yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., the nation’s second-
largest oil explorer, climbed 1 percent to 2,982 yen.  Crude oil for January delivery rose 0.2 percent to settle
at $89.38 a barrel in New York yesterday on speculation the U.S.
may extend stimulus measures, bolstering fuel demand in the
world’s largest oil-consuming country, and on cold-weather
forecasts for the U.S. and Europe.  Crude had its longest advance in four weeks after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed may expand bond
purchases beyond the $600 billion announced last month. Winter
weather in parts of the U.S. and Europe boosted demand for
heating fuel. Copper futures for delivery in March rose 0.2
percent in New York yesterday, after reaching the highest for a
most-active contract since Nov. 12.  -- With assistance from  Satoshi Kawano . Editor:  Nick Gentle ,  Sam Waite .  To contact the reporters for this story:
