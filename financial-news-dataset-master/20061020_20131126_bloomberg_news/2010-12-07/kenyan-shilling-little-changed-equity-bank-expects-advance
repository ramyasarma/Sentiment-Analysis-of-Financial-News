Kenya’s shilling was little changed
against the dollar. The currency may strengthen in the coming
weeks, Nairobi-based  Equity Bank Ltd.  said today in an e-mailed
note to clients.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened 0.1
percent to 80.45 per dollar at 10:48 a.m. in the capital,
Nairobi, from yesterday’s close of 80.35.  The shilling may gain against the dollar in the remainder
of the year “due to reduced imports and rising remittances from
the diaspora, coupled with higher tourism,” Equity Bank said.  Kenya’s current-account deficit narrowed to $1.79 billion
in the year through August, from $2 billion a year earlier, the
central bank said Dec. 3. Cumulative remittances during the nine
months through September climbed 22 percent from a year earlier
to $461.4 million, the bank said Nov. 19. The country is a
popular destination for tourists during the European winter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
