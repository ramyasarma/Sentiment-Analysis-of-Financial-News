AirAsia Bhd. , Southeast Asia’s
biggest budget carrier, plans to form a Philippine unit by the
first quarter of next year, Philippine Board of Investments head
 Cristino Panlilio  said.  The Philippine venture will be formed with  Antonio Cojuangco , a former chairman of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co., and start flying domestic and overseas routes in
2011, Panlilio said by phone today. Cojuangco is President
 Benigno Aquino ’s cousin and a nephew of San Miguel Corp.
Chairman  Eduardo Cojuangco .  Sepang, Malaysia-based AirAsia may expand into the
Philippines as airlines including  Cebu Air Inc.  increase their
fleets and services to meet rising demand in the archipelago.
The government has set a target to double tourism arrivals in
six years to help spur economic growth.  Today is a national holiday in Malaysia. An e-mail to
AirAsia Chief Executive Officer  Tony Fernandes  didn’t
immediately receive a reply.  Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd., the budget carrier backed by
Singapore Airlines Ltd., on Nov. 23 said it will lease two
planes to South East Asian Airlines or SEAir and form a
marketing venture to expand into the Philippines.  SEAir flights from Clark, north of Manila, to Singapore
will start Dec. 16 and be offered through Tiger Air’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
