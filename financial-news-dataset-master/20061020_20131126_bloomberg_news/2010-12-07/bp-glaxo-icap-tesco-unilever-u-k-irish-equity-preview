U.K. stocks climbed to a three-week
high, led by retailers and mining companies, as  Tesco Plc 
reported a pickup in sales and base-metal prices surged.  Tesco, Britain’s largest supermarket chain, advanced 2.4
percent. Smaller rival J Sainsbury Plc rallied 4.3 percent amid
renewed speculation Qatar may be considering a takeover.  Antofagasta Plc  and  Xstrata Plc  climbed as copper jumped to a
record in London. Unilever rose 2.9 percent after Morgan Stanley
recommended the world’s second-biggest consumer-goods maker.  The  FTSE 100 Index  gained 38.17, or 0.7 percent, to
5,808.45 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the highest level
since Nov. 15. The gauge has climbed 5.1 percent so far this
month, rebounding from November’s 2.6 percent slide. The  FTSE
All-Share Index  rose 0.7 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index advanced 1.8 percent as Finance Minister Brian Lenihan
published a 6 billion-euro ($8 billion) budget plan aimed at
boosting investor confidence.  “The FTSE 100 has firmly bounced back from the selloff
endured over November and now looks positioned for another
attack at the 5,900 level,” said Joshua Raymond, market
strategist at City Index in  London . “Strong sales at Tesco have
helped to provide a boost for retail stocks.”  A report today showed U.K. manufacturing expanded twice as
much as economists forecast in October, a sign the recovery is
maintaining momentum into the final quarter of the year.  Output rose 0.6 percent from September, the most in seven
months, the Office for National Statistics said. The median
forecast of 23 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for an
increase of 0.3 percent.  Tesco Sales  Tesco rose 2.4 percent to 430 pence after the retailer said
sales in the peak Christmas period are ahead of its forecasts.
Revenue at U.K. stores open at least a year rose 0.7 percent to
0.8 percent, excluding gasoline and including value-added tax in
the 13 weeks to Nov. 27. That beat the 0.3 percent median
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. International same-
stores sales rose 4.1 percent.  “There are some encouraging signs in this statement,”
said  Richard Hunter , head of U.K. equities at Hargreaves
Lansdown Stockbrokers in London. “In particular, the growth in
overseas sales continues apace, with promising numbers from
Europe, Asia and the U.S.”  Sainsbury rallied 4.3 percent to 372.8 pence, the biggest
gain since July, amid speculation Qatar Investment Authority may
consider buying the U.K.’s third-largest supermarket company.  ‘Looking to Bid’  “Sainsbury is up on renewed speculation that Qatar is
looking to bid between 425 pence and 450 pence per share,” said
Jawaid Afsar, a trader at Securequity Ltd. in Sheffield,
England.  The Financial Times reported in October that Qatar may
still be interested in acquiring the retailer, citing an
interview with Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. A spokesman
for Sainsbury declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg
News today.  Antofagasta, owner of copper mines in Chile, gained 4.9
percent to 1,528 pence. Xstrata, the world’s fourth-largest
copper producer, increased 1.6 percent to 1,460.5 pence.  BHP
Billiton Ltd . climbed 1.7 percent to 2,481 pence.  Copper rose to a record on concern governments may need to
pump more money into economies to support a recovery, fueling
inflation and eroding currency values. Copper for three-month
delivery climbed as high as $9,044 a metric ton on the London
Metal Exchange.  Unilever Upgrade  Unilever gained 2.9 percent to 1,906 pence after Morgan
Stanley raised its recommendation for the maker of Lipton Tea to
“overweight” from “underweight” and lifted its price
estimate for the shares by 21 percent to 2,300 pence.  Homebuilders led gains on the broader  FTSE 250 Index  as  Bellway Plc  said first-half pretax profit will increase as much
as 20 percent.  Bellway, which focuses on first-time buyers, advanced 9.8
percent to 612.5 pence.  Barratt Developments Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest homebuilder by volume, gained 9.5 percent to 86.3 pence.  Taylor Wimpey Plc  climbed 6.5 percent to 29 pence and Persimmon
Plc surged 8.8 percent to 416.4 pence.    BP Plc , which is seeking to cover clean-up costs from its
Gulf of Mexico oil spill, increased 1.1 percent to 455 pence.
The company is weighing the sale of some North Sea assets that
may raise as much as $1 billion, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  BP, Wolseley  BP may sell some fields and infrastructure in a region
where it has operated for more than 40 years, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the discussions are
private and no decision has been reached. Toby Odone, a BP
spokesman in London, declined to comment.    Wolseley Plc  climbed 2.7 percent to 1,880 pence as the
world’s largest supplier of heating and plumbing products said
trading in the three months to Oct. 31 was “slightly ahead of
management expectations.”    Focus Solutions Group Plc  jumped 9.8 percent to 140 pence
after  Standard Life Plc , Scotland’s biggest insurer, agreed to
buy the financial software maker for about 42 million pounds
($66 million).    ICAP Plc  fell 1.7 percent to 519 pence after IPGL Ltd.’s
wholly owned subsidiary, INCAP Finance BV sold a stake in the
interdealer broker for about 30.7 million pounds. HSBC Holdings
Plc placed 6 million shares on behalf of INCAP for 512 pence
apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
