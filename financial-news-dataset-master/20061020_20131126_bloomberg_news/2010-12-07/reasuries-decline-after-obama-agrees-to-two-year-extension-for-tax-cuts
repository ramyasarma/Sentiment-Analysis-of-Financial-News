Treasuries  tumbled, pushing the 10-
year note yield up the most since June 2009, after President
 Barack Obama  agreed to extend tax cuts for two years and the
three-year note sale drew the lowest demand since February.  The price of the 30-year bond fell more than 2 points on
concern Obama’s plan also includes a payroll tax cut of 2
percentage points to help support the recovery, potentially
widening budget deficits. Today’s $32 billion offering of three-
year securities lifted the total amount of notes and bonds
auctioned by the Treasury to $2.116 trillion, topping last
year’s auction record of $2.109 trillion.  “The tax cut package is a game changer,” said  Jay Mueller , who manages about $3 billion of bonds at Wells Fargo &
Co. in Milwaukee. “The tax agreement is more pro stimulus and
pro growth than anyone expected going into the debate and
changes the odds of a double dip. That is not what the Treasury
market wants to see.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield climbed 20 basis points,
or 0.20 percentage point, to 3.14 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 dropped 1 22/32, or
$16.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 95 21/32.  The gain in the yield was the biggest since an increase of
21 basis points on June 1, 2009, when economic reports showed
the recession was abating. The yield touched 3.17 percent today,
the  highest level  since June 23, according to Bloomberg data.
Two-year note yields gained 10 basis points to 0.53 percent in
the biggest gain on a closing basis since March 24.  Long Bond Yields  Thirty-year bond  yields  rose as much as 20 basis points to
4.44 percent, the highest since May 14. The yield on the
existing three-year note gained 13 basis points to 0.82 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year notes over
2-year debt increased to 2.61 percentage points, the biggest
spread since May.  The yield on the 10-year note has increased 48 basis points
since the day before the Federal Reserve began the second round
of government debt purchases on Nov. 12.  “Yields had been trending higher, and today’s announcement
has served as the catalyst that has been the exclamation point
on the more upbeat outlook that the bond market has been
romancing,” said  Anthony Crescenzi , a bond strategist at
Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management
Co., which operates the world’s biggest bond fund.  Obama on Taxes  U.S. debt declined as Obama said he would accept a lower
rate for the estate tax than Democrats wanted in order to break
a stalemate over extending  George W. Bush ’s tax cuts before
Congress adjourns.  The current tax rates, enacted in 2001 and 2003, are set
to expire Dec. 31. Without the compromise, middle-income
families would become “collateral damage for political warfare
here in Washington,” Obama said in televised remarks yesterday.  Obama’s deal with congressional Republicans to extend tax
cuts will expand the  federal budget deficit  and make a reduction
in the issuance of Treasuries unlikely, according to Credit
Suisse Group AG.  The compromise will add $148 billion to the shortfall,
pushing it to $1.34 trillion for fiscal 2011, Credit Suisse
strategists  Scott Sherman ,  Ira Jersey  and  Jay Feldman , all based
in New York, wrote in a report to clients today. The forecast is
near the $1.42 trillion and $1.29 trillion deficits in the 2009
and 2010 fiscal years.  Three-Year Auction  At today’s three-year note auction, the securities drew a
yield of 0.862 percent, compared with the average forecast of
0.841 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 6 of the 18 primary
dealers. The last sale of three-year notes, on Nov. 8, drew a
yield of 0.575 percent.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.91, the
lowest level since February, when it was 2.83.  The U.S. will auction $21 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow
and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on Dec. 9 for a total of $66
billion this week.  “‘We will probably see even more concession heading into
the 10-year auction,” said  John Briggs , a U.S. government bond
strategist in Stamford, Connecticut, at Royal Bank of Scotland
Plc, which as a primary dealer is obliged to participate in
government auctions.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for  consumer prices  over the life of the debt known as the
break-even rate, widened to 2.25 percentage points, the most
since May, from this year’s low of 1.47 percentage points
reached in August.  Bernanke on Easing  Treasuries rallied yesterday, pushing the 10-year note
yield down the most since Nov. 16, after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in an interview broadcast Dec. 5 on CBS Corp.’s
“60 Minutes” program that the central bank may boost debt
purchases to support the economy.  The Fed bought today $6.81 billion of Treasuries maturing
from December 2014 to May 2016 as part of an asset-purchase
program aimed at lowering borrowing costs and stimulating
economic growth, according to the New York Fed’s  website .  German 10-year government bonds, the euro region’s
benchmark securities, dropped today as traders speculated that
Ireland will win parliamentary approval for an austerity plan as
it seeks to seal an international bailout.  Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  told parliament in
Dublin today that while cutting spending by 6 billion euros
($8 billion) next year is “demanding,” it shows the
government’s commitment to reducing the budget deficit.  The German 10-year  yield  rose as much as 11 basis points to
2.96 percent, the highest level since May 13.  U.S. government debt has handed investors a 7.3 percent
return this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. German debt has gained 6.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
