China’s cotton price rally this year
may fail to spur more planting next season as farmers are
concerned about market volatility and high input costs, the
 China Cotton Association  said, citing its own survey.  China’s cotton prices have almost doubled this year to a
record 33,720 yuan ($5,071) a metric ton on Nov. 10, before
tumbling 19 percent amid government efforts to crack down on
speculation and rein in inflation pressure.  “Cotton is a labor-intensive crop, that’s why the volatile
prices and high input costs such as labor and raw materials have
prevented farmers from greatly increasing the acreage,” the
association said, citing a survey done in November among 1,700
farmers in 12 provinces.  Planting may rise by 11.7 percent in 2011 along the Yangtze
River and by 4.9 percent along the Yellow River, respectively,
the survey showed. The association didn’t mention farmers’
planting intentions in Xinjiang, China’s biggest producer.  China’s cotton output may fall 5.5 percent this year to
6.36 million metric tons after rain and cold weather damaged
crops, according to Cncotton.com, a research company.  Demand in China is forecast to outpace supply by 17 million
bales in the year ending July 31, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture forecast on Nov. 9. Stockpiles in the U.S. are
predicted to fall to 2.2 million bales this season, down 25
percent from 2.95 million last year. A bale weighs about 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms.  To contact the reporter for this story:  Feiwen Rong  in Beijing
