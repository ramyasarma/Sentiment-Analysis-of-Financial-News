Gasoil advanced to the highest price
in more than two years on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The fuel’s crack, or premium to Brent crude, widened.  Koch Industries Inc. bought a cargo of naphtha from
Glencore International AG. Vitol Group bought jet-fuel barges
from Morgan Stanley for a second day.  Light Products  Koch purchased a 12,500-ton cargo of naphtha at $835 a
metric ton, priced for delivery to Rotterdam from Dec. 18 to
Dec. 22, according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring
the Platts pricing window which ends at 4:30 p.m. in London.
Naphtha is used in gasoline and petrochemical production.  Gasoline barges  for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp, Europe’s oil-trading hub, traded from $826 to
$832 a ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and Platts. That’s
below yesterday’s trading range from $833 to $843.  The trades are for Eurobob grade to which ethanol is added
to make finished motor fuel.  Premium unleaded gasoline changed hands from $839 to $851 a
ton, according to the survey of Platts. That compares with deals
yesterday from $841 to $848.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for January delivery advanced for a fifth day to
$771.75 a ton as of 4:34 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange.

was at $764.50 a ton.  The  January gasoil crack , or premium to Brent crude,
widened for a fourth day to $12.28 a barrel from $12.11 a barrel
yesterday. Brent for January settlement traded at $91.26 a
barrel on the ICE exchange after rising as much as 1.5 percent
to $92.86.   Gasoil barges traded at discounts of $4.50 to $5.25 a ton
to December ICE gasoil, the Platts survey showed. That compares
with trades yesterday at $5.50 to $6.50 below the gasoil
contract.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges traded at premiums of $24
and $26 a ton to December ICE gasoil, according to the Platts
survey. That’s in line with yesterday’s trades.  Vitol bought 4,000 tons of jet fuel in two separate deals
at a premium of $63 a ton to December ICE gasoil, the survey
showed. That’s in line with yesterday’s trade.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil’s discount to Brent fell for a fifth
day to $17.10 a barrel, the lowest level since Jan. 5 last year.
High-sulfur fuel oil is used as a shipping fuel and in power
generation in some countries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
