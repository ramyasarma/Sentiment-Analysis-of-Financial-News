Crude oil inventories fell 7.34
million barrels last week to 349.3 million, the American
Petroleum Institute said today.  Gasoline inventories gained 4.8 million barrels to 220
million, the report showed.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.  Analysts expect the government report to show stockpiles of
crude oil declined over the period. Supplies probably dropped
1.4 million barrels, according to the median of 16 responses in
a  Bloomberg News  survey. Gasoline inventories slipped 300,000
barrels, the survey showed.  Oil-supply totals from the API and DOE have moved in the
same direction 75 percent of the time over the past four years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Oil for January delivery fell $1.04, or 1.2 percent, to
$88.34 a barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The contract traded at $88.19 before
release of the report at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
