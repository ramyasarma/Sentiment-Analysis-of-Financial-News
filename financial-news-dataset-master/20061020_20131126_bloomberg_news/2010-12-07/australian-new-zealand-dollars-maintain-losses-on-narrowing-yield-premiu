Australia’s dollar rose to a six-week
high against New Zealand’s before a report forecast to show the
jobless rate fell in the larger South Pacific nation, fueling
speculation the central bank will raise interest rates.  The Aussie strengthened against its New Zealand
counterpart, nicknamed the kiwi, after reports showed Australian
home-loan  approvals  increased in October and New Zealand
construction declined. Both currencies dropped for a third day
against the greenback as the extra yields offered by their bonds
over Treasuries tumbled. Economists said New Zealand will keep
its benchmark interest rate unchanged tomorrow. The Reserve Bank
of Australia kept its key rate at 4.75 percent on Dec. 6.  “The focus is very much on the employment figures out
tomorrow, more so as an indicator as to when the RBA may move in
the new year,” said  Tim Waterer , a foreign-exchange dealer at
CMC Markets in Sydney. “There’s increased buying interest in
the Aussie.”  Australia’s currency rose 0.7 percent to NZ$1.3076 at 11:43
a.m. in New York, from NZ$1.2980 yesterday. It earlier touched
NZ$1.3097, the strongest since Oct. 27.  The Aussie depreciated 0.7 percent to 97.64 U.S. cents,
from 98.29 cents yesterday, and slipped 0.2 percent to 82.24
yen, from 82.07 yen. New Zealand’s dollar dropped 1.4 percent to
74.69 U.S. cents, and weakened 0.5 percent to 62.90 yen from,
63.21 yen.  Australian Jobs  Australian employers added 20,000 jobs in November, taking
the jobless rate down to 5.2 percent from 5.4 percent in the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg News survey before a
statistics bureau report due to be released at 7:30 p.m. New
York time. Home-loan  approvals  rose 1.9 percent in October from
the previous month, the bureau said today, outpacing the
forecast for no change in a separate Bloomberg survey.  New Zealand’s currency weakened against 15 of its 16 major
counterparts after the government said manufacturing sales
volumes shrank 1.4 percent in the third quarter. The value of
residential construction fell 5.3 percent from the previous
three months, excluding inflation, a separate report showed.  The  extra yield  investors get from buying Australia’s two-
year government debt instead of similar-dated Treasuries shrank
to 4.24 percentage points, near the 4.22 percentage points
touched on Dec. 2 that was the narrowest since Sept. 16.  The  premium  offered by three-year government debt in New
Zealand over the U.S. contracted to 3.13 percentage points, the
least since June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
