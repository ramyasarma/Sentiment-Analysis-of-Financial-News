Deacons Kenya Ltd ., a Kenyan clothing
retailer, sold 701 million shillings ($8.7 million) of stock,
short of its 800 million shillings target to fund an expansion
in its home market and neighboring territories.  The company offered 12.8 million shares, or 39.5 percent of
its stock, to the public at 62.50 shillings each from Nov. 17 to
Nov. 30, Deacons said in a statement published today in the
Nairobi-based Standard newspaper.  “We will expand the store footprint within Kenya and the
region, particularly Uganda and Rwanda,” Chief Executive
Officer Muchiri Wahome said on Nov. 17. The company has 23
outlets in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, he said.  Deacons has distribution agreements with South African
retailers including  Mr Price Group Ltd. , Truworths International
Ltd., Woolworths Holdings Ltd., and with German sporting-goods
maker  Adidas AG . Its own brands include 4U2, Angelo and Life
Fitness, according to the statement. The company began
operations in 1958 with a distribution agreement for Marks &
Spencer Group Plc in East Africa for 22 years.  The company may begin trading it shares on the  Nairobi
Stock Exchange  before the end of next year, Wahome said.  A private placement by Deacons in 2006, at an offer price
of 30 shillings a share, raised 118 million shillings. The two
biggest shareholders in the company are Swedfund International
AB, with a stake of 19.45 percent, and Pinpoint Investment Ltd.,
with a holding of 12.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
