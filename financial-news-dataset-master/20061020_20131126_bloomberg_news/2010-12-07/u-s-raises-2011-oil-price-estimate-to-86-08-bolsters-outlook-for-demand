The U.S. Energy Department  bolstered
its crude oil price forecast for 2011 on projections for higher
global economic growth.  West Texas Intermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark, will
average $86.08 a barrel next year, up from last month’s forecast
of $85.17, the department said today in its monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook. Prices in 2010 will average $78.98, 18 cents
higher than November’s estimate of $78.80.  “It doesn’t take that much of an increase in demand to
tighten the market and raise prices,” said  Tancred Lidderdale ,
an economist with the department’s Energy Information
Administration in Washington, who helped write the report.  The department raised its outlook for global oil
consumption next year to 87.78 million barrels a day from 87.77
million last month. The 2010 demand projection increased to
86.35 million, up from 86.33 in November.  U.S. oil consumption will average 19.24 million barrels a
day next year, up 80,000 barrels from last month’s forecast.
This year’s projection was bolstered by 10,000 barrels from the
November report.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, will
cost $3 a gallon in 2011, up 1 percent from $2.97 estimated in
the November report. The fuel will average $2.77 a gallon this
year, up 18 percent from $2.35 in 2009 and unchanged from last
month’s projection.  U.S. heating oil users will spend an average $2,176 this
winter, up 1.4 percent from $2,146 forecast last month and 14
percent higher than the average $1,907 spent by households last
winter. The cost per gallon will average $3.18 this heating
season, up 5 cents from last month’s estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
