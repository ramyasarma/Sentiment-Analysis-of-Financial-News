Universal Music Group, the world’s
biggest record company, hired Sony Music executive  Barry Weiss 
to ramp up artist development.  Weiss, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sony Music’s
RCA/Jive Label Group, will oversee Universal’s New York-based
labels, according to a person familiar with the decision, who
declined to be identified because the hiring hasn’t been
announced.  Weiss helped develop the careers of recording artists
including  Britney Spears , Backstreet Boys and ‘N Sync. The 51-
year-old executive will continue to oversee RCA/Jive until his
contract ends April 30,  Liz Young , a spokeswoman for Tokyo-based
 Sony Corp.’s  music unit, said today in an interview.  Sony Music is losing a top executive as CEO  Rolf Schmidt- Holtz’s  contract expires in March.  Universal’s parent  Vivendi SA , based in Paris,  gained  22
cents to 19.92 euros today in stock marketing trading in Paris.
Sony American Depositary Receipts  fell  47 cents to $36.10 at 4
