Alitalia SpA  investors will soon be
able to collect Italian government bonds they were offered in
exchange for their securities after the airline was declared
insolvent in 2008.  The Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement that its
decree permitting the swap had been published in the
government’s  official gazette , allowing for the bonds with a
nominal value of 312.9 million euros ($418 million) to be
transferred to the Bank of Italy for disbursement.  Under the initial terms of the plan, bondholders were due
to recoup 71 percent of their securities’ nominal value.
Shareholders will be allowed to  swap  their stock for the bonds
at a value of about 27 cents a share.  Alitalia was put into bankruptcy administration on Aug. 29,
2008 and broken up in early 2009. The passenger-flight business
is now owned by a group of Italian investors and  Air France-KLM
Group , while the rest of the company is operating under
protection from creditors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
