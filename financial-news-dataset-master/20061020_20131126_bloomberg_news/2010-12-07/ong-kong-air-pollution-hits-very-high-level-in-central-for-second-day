Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection
Department reported “very high” air pollution in the city’s
Central business district for the second straight day.  The Air Pollution Index was 156 in Central, 97 in Causeway
Bay and 81 in Mong Kok as of 7 a.m., the department said on its
website.  Readings above 100 are classified “very high” and trigger
a government warning for people with heart or respiratory
ailments to avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
