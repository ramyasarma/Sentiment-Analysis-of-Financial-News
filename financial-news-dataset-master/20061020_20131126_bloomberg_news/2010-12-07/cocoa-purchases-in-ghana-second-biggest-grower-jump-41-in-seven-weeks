Cocoa purchases in Ghana, the world’s
second-biggest producer of the beans, rose 40.8 percent in the
seven weeks to Nov. 18, according to a government official with
access to the information.  Companies licensed by the Ghana Cocoa Board to purchase
beans from farmers bought 376,303 metric tons during the period,
compared with 267,327 tons a year earlier, the data showed. The
official declined to be identified because the figures are
confidential.   Purchases during the week ended Nov. 18 increased to 52,348
tons from 33,058 tons in the seventh week of the 2009-10 season.
Ghana borders Ivory Coast, the world’s top producer of 
the chocolate ingredient.  To contact the reporter on this story:
