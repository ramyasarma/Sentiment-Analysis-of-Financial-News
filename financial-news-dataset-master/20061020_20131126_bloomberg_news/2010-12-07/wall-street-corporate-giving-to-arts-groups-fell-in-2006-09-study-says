The recession that began in December
2007 battered Gen Art Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes
filmmakers and other artists. Gen Art saw steep drops in funding
from  American Express Co. ,  Citibank N.A.  and  Honda Motor Co.  The
nonprofit closed in May, and an associated for-profit company,
Generational Art Production Inc., went bankrupt in July.  “To see the company collapse over 18 months after building
it and the foundation for 15 years was pretty devastating,” Ian
Gerard, Gen Art’s executive director, said in a phone interview.  Corporate giving to the arts fell broadly in the period
2006-2009, dropping to 28 percent from 43 percent of 600
businesses surveyed in a study released yesterday by the
 Business Committee for the Arts , a program founded by
philanthropist  David Rockefeller  in 1967 to promote businesses’
cultural philanthropy. BCA is a unit of the Washington-based
advocacy group Americans for the Arts.  The study shows that during the period, larger businesses
($50 million or more in revenue) pared donations, while medium-
sized ($1 million to $50 million) and small companies (under $1
million) boosted giving.  The median point for gifts from large businesses declined
to a $15,000 from $25,000 during those three years. For small
businesses, donations grew to $700 from $500, and gifts from
medium-sized businesses grew to $2,250 from $2,000.  “In the overall arts budget scene across America, there is
a very thin line between black and red,” said Robert L. Lynch,
Americans for the Arts chief executive officer. “Slippage in
any donation area is a problem.”  Telephone Poll  The BCA survey numbers were based on a telephone poll
conducted in 2009 by  Shugoll Research Inc . of 600 small, mid-
size and large U.S. companies. The study was released only this
month because of the time it took to compile and analyze the
data, BCA spokeswoman Catherine Brandt said in a phone
interview.  Of the businesses surveyed, 27 percent said that supporting
the arts was among their highest priorities, 2 percent said it
was a top priority, 50 percent said funding the arts was of
moderate importance, and 6 percent said it was a “very low
priority.”  About 67 percent said they expect donations this year to
remain the same as in 2009, while 22 percent predicted a
decrease and 10 percent said gifts would rise.  To contact the writer on this story:
