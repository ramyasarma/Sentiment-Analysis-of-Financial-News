South African inflation expectations
eased in the fourth quarter, the Bureau for Economic Research
said.  Analysts, businesses and labor union officials expect
inflation to average 5.5 percent in 2011, down from 6.1 percent
forecast in the third-quarter survey, the bureau, based at the
University of Stellenbosch, near Cape Town, said in an e-mailed
statement today.   The inflation rate will probably average 6.2 percent in
2012, down from a previous forecast of 6.4 percent, the survey
showed. Inflation was 3.4 percent in October, close to the lower
end of the central bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
