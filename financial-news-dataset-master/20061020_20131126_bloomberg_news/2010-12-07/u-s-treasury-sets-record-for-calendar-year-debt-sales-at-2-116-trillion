The U.S. Treasury set a record for
borrowing in a calendar year after selling $32 billion of three-
year securities to push its total note and bond sales to $2.116
trillion amid all-time high demand for the debt.  Bond dealers and investors have bid $6.33 trillion at the
auctions this year, or a record $2.99 for every dollar of debt
sold.  Treasuries  tumbled today, pushing the 10-year note yield
up the most since September 2008, after President  Barack Obama 
agreed to extend tax cuts for two years and the three-year note
sale drew the lowest demand since February.  “The fact that Treasury is able to issue all this paper
and get it financed speaks to the fact that deleveraging in the
private sector has been on-going and significant,”  Chris Ahrens , head interest-rate strategist at UBS AG in Greenwich,
Connecticut, one of 18  primary dealers  that trade directly with
the Federal Reserve. “The household sector, the business
sector, the financial sector continues to deleverage, paving the
way for Treasury to pick up the slack.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield climbed 21 basis points,
or 0.21 percentage point, to 3.13 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 dropped 1 24/32, or
$17 per $1,000 face amount, to 95 22/32.  The yield touched 3.17 percent today, the  highest level 
since June 23, according to Bloomberg data. Two-year note yields
gained 10 basis points to 0.52 percent.  The Treasury sold $2.109 trillion in notes and bonds in
2009, more than double the $922 billion it sold in 2008 as the
financial crisis took root and led to $1.82 trillion of credit-
related losses since the start of 2007.  Treasury debt outstanding has  nearly doubled  since the
start of the crisis to $8.75 trillion as of November from $4.40
trillion from the start of the crisis in July 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
