Oil pared earlier losses to trade
near a 26-month high as investors purchased commodities as a
drop in the dollar spurred the buying of riskier assets.  Crude reversed an earlier 0.7 percent decline today as the
 Dollar Index , a measure of the greenback against six major
currencies, slipped 0.2 percent. The extension of U.S. tax cuts
for another two years bolstered Asian equities and boosted
optimism for fuel demand. Copper prices also reached a record in
London as investors sought alternative investments.  Crude for January delivery was at $89.46 a barrel, up 8
cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 4:09 p.m. Singapore time. The contract earlier fell as much
as 58 cents to $88.80. Yesterday, prices rose to $89.38, the
highest settlement since Oct. 7, 2008.  Brent crude for January settlement was at $91.46 a barrel,
up 1 cent, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract earlier lost as much as 54 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$90.91. Yesterday, it gained 3 cents to $91.45.  To contact the reporter on this story:
