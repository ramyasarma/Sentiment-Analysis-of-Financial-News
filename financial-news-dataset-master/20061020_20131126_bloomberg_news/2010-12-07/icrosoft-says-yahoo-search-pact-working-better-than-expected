Microsoft Corp.’s search partnership
with Yahoo! Inc. is working “better than we could have hoped”
and the company is more confident that the accord will boost the
prices paid for search terms, an executive said.  The arrangement, whereby Microsoft’s Bing handles the
mechanics of Web search and Yahoo oversees advertising sales, is
exceeding expectations, Charles Songhurst, Microsoft’s general
manager of corporate strategy, said today at a conference for
investors.  Yahoo began depending on Bing’s technology earlier this
year to cut costs and gain market share. Google Inc.’s Web
search lead helps it make more money per search because
advertisers are willing to pay for wider distribution. Google
had 66 percent of the U.S. market in October, said Comscore
Inc., while Microsoft and Yahoo combined for 28 percent.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, struck the search
accord after it failed in an attempt to buy Yahoo.  Songhurst, whose official bio lists accomplishments
including, “helping kill the acquisition of Yahoo ($48 billion
saved) and negotiating” the agreement to partner with Yahoo
instead, was speaking at a Nasdaq conference in London.  Microsoft rose 3 cents to $26.87 as of 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale,
California, gained 61 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $16.94.  To contact the reporter on this story:
