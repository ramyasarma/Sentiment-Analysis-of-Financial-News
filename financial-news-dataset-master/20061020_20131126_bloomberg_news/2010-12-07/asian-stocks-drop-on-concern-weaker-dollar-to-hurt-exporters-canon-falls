Asian  stocks  rose for a fifth day,
led by commodity companies on speculation that a global economic
recovery is stabilizing after Australia kept its main interest
rate unchanged and the U.S. cut its stake in Citigroup Inc.  BHP Billiton Ltd. and  Rio Tinto Group , the world’s No. 1
and No. 3 mining companies, climbed more than 1 percent in
Sydney as oil and metal prices gained in New York yesterday.
PetroChina Co., the country’s biggest oil company, advanced 1.8
percent in Hong Kong. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the
nation’s largest lender by market value, rose 1 percent. Honda
Motor Co. led a drop by Japanese exporters on concern the dollar
at a three-week low against the yen will cut overseas earnings.  “Markets should like one of the largest bailed-out U.S.
banks becoming independent again,” said  Gavin Parry , managing
director of Hong Kong-based Parry International Trading Ltd.
“This could be seen as a closing chapter to the 2008 crisis. It
also fits well with the overall U.S. recovery story.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 0.3 percent to 134.07 at
7:29 p.m. in Tokyo, reversing a 0.2 percent drop and heading for
its longest winning streak in a month. About seven shares
advanced for every six that declined.  The gauge slid 0.6 percent  last month  after two straight
monthly gains as concern grew that China’s anti-inflation
measures, Europe’s debt crisis and tensions on the Korean
peninsula may cool the global economic recovery.  Australia Rates  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.8 percent in Sydney as
the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged and
said inflation will likely be contained over coming quarters.
South Korea’s Kospi Index climbed 0.5 percent in Seoul, and Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 0.8 percent. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index gained 0.7 percent. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average  slid 0.3 percent.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 0.9
percent. The index fell 0.1 percent yesterday, snapping a three-
day rally, after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the world’s largest economy may require more stimulus.  The U.S. Treasury Department raised about $10.5 billion
selling its remaining stock in  Citigroup  in a public offering.
The sale helps the company, recipient of a $45 billion taxpayer-
funded bailout in 2008, exit the rescue, which was provided to
keep the New York-based bank from collapsing. Separately, U.S.
President Barack Obama said he’ll agree to a two-year extension
on all tax cuts by his predecessor in a compromise deal he
called “an essential step on the road to recovery.”  Oil, Metals Gain  Material and energy companies  led gains  among the 10
industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, and BHP Billiton
was its biggest single boost. BHP Billiton, Australia’s No. 1
oil producer, rose 1.2 percent to A$45.08 in Sydney. Rio Tinto
climbed 1.6 percent to A$87.34.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. ,
Australia’s second-largest oil and gas producer, gained 0.5
percent to A$42.90. In Hong Kong, PetroChina advanced 1.8
percent to HK$10.10.  Crude oil for January delivery rose 0.2 percent to settle
at $89.38 a barrel in New York yesterday on speculation the U.S.
may extend stimulus measures, bolstering fuel demand in the
world’s largest oil-consuming country. Copper futures climbed
0.2 percent in New York, and rose as much as 0.9 percent today.  “Commodity markets are firm, which may boost resource-
related companies,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at
Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “Concerns about the
strong yen may weaken exporters.”  Commonwealth Bank of Australia rose 1 percent to A$49.76 in
Sydney, while rival  National Australia Bank Ltd.  climbed 1
percent to A$23.96.  Economic Outlook  The Reserve Bank of Australia left the overnight cash rate
target at 4.75 percent today, as forecast by all 26 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. After seven rate increases since
October 2009, Governor Glenn Stevens said monetary policy is
“appropriate for the economic outlook.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  climbed 11 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 9.7 percent by the S&P
500 and 6.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 14.4 times for the S&P 500 and 12.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Honda , Japan’s second-largest carmaker by sales, dropped
1.9 percent to 3,075 yen in Tokyo and was the heaviest single
drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Toyota Motor Co., the
world’s biggest carmaker, sank 0.6 percent to 3,255 yen.  Canon
Inc. , which is the world’s largest camera maker and receives
more than 80 percent of its revenue outside of Japan, slid 0.4
percent to 4,055 yen.  Advantest Climbs  The dollar depreciated to as low as 82.34 yen today in
Tokyo, its lowest level since Nov. 12. A weaker dollar reduces
the value of U.S. income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency.  “People in the market are worried the stronger yen will
hurt exporters’ earnings,” said  Naoteru Teraoka , general
manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $26 billion.  Advantest Corp., the world’s biggest maker of machines used
to test memory chips, jumped 3.7 percent to 1,866 yen in Tokyo
and was the largest support for the Nikkei 225. Singapore-based
Verigy Ltd. said the Japanese company made a takeover offer for
Verigy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
