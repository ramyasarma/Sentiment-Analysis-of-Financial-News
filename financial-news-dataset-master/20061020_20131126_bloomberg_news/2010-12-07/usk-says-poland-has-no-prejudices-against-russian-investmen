Poland  won’t complete the sale of
Grupa Lotos SA, its second-largest oil refiner, before 2012,
Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.  The Treasury Ministry called for bids for Lotos in October
and gave potential buyers until Feb. 4 to place initial offers.
The invitation is “the first step in what will probably be a
very long process,” which may not end in a sale, Tusk said at a
news conference in Warsaw today.  The deal is part of a four-year program in which Poland
plans to raise 55 billion zloty ($18 billion) from selling
assets. This year the country plans to reach 25 billion zloty
from such sales. The government’s 53 percent stake in Lotos  was
valued  at 2.28 billion zloty at 3:41 p.m. in Warsaw trading.  Russian companies such as OAO Gazprom and OAO Rosneft are
interested in acquiring Lotos and may team up to bid, Russian
Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko said yesterday.  Tusk said Poland has no objections to Russian companies
bidding for Lotos.  “The period of prejudice against  Russia  has ended in
Poland,” he said. “We’re not hiding it from the Russians that
Lotos is a company of a special importance for our energy
security,” he said, adding that the resulting criteria may be
“difficult” for potential bidders.  Lotos’s refinery, based in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea, will
process 10.5 million tons of oil a year starting in 2011, after
the company increased capacity from 6 million tons last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
