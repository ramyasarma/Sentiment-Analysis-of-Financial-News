Gold climbed to records in New York
and London on demand for an alternative investment to
currencies. Silver advanced to a 30-year high.  Gold rallied as the dollar fell to a three-week low against
the yen and weakened against most other major counterparts after
President  Barack Obama  said he would agree to sustain tax cuts.
Gold traded in Japanese yen rose to the highest price since
1983. Precious metals gained this year as Europe’s debts
weakened paper money.  “With all the concern going on about the U.S., and all the
debt issues in Europe, there’s no currency that anybody really
wants to hold,” said  Connor Noonan , an analyst at Castlestone
Management Ltd. in London. “What we used to see in this kind of
situation was safe-haven buying in dollars and now that’s
turning into safe-haven buying of gold.”  Gold for delivery in February jumped to the all-time high
of $1,432.50 an ounce and was up $14.50, or 1 percent, at
$1,430.60 by 8:36 a.m. on the Comex in New York, the seventh
consecutive gain. Spot gold climbed $4.65, or 0.3 percent, to
$1,428.40 an ounce, after earlier today touching $1,431.25.  The metal in the morning “ fixing ,” the price used by some
mining companies to sell production, climbed to $1,426 an ounce,
the most since at least 1984, from $1,415.25 an ounce at
yesterday afternoon’s fixing, according to data on Bloomberg.  Assets of gold in  exchange-traded products  rose 0.75 metric
ton to 2,099.15 tons yesterday as prices climbed to an all-time
high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers.
Gold futures have jumped 30 percent this year after governments
spent trillions of dollars and kept interest rates low to
bolster economies after the worst global recession since World
War II.  Debt Crisis  “The market is all about the European debt crisis and a
third round of quantitative easing in the U.S.,” said  Wallace Ng , executive director of commodities at ABN Amro Bank NV in
Hong Kong. “Gold is now driven by investment demand” and
purchases from jewelers and physical users particularly from
India have been muted, he said.  Ng forecast investors would sell the metal at near-record
levels, and pegged gold’s support for the week at $1,400.  Silver for delivery in March advanced 91.5 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $30.65 an ounce. The futures earlier today rose to
$30.75, the highest price for a most-active contract since March
12, 1980.  Palladium for March delivery increased $20.90, or 2.8
percent, to $772.30 an ounce and platinum for January delivery
rose $16.60, or 1 percent, to $1,730.20 an ounce. Both metals
trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange in New York.  -- With assistance from Chanyaporn Chanjaroen in Singapore.
