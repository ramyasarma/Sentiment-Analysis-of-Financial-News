Australia has completed a A$160
million ($158 million) loan to the state of New South Wales to
help  James Hardie Industries NV  compensate asbestos victims
after a weak U.S. housing market crimped the company’s earnings.  New South Wales will contribute an equal amount of money to
the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund each time they draw down
the loan, Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  told reporters today in
Canberra. The advance was agreed to in November, 2009.  James Hardie, the biggest seller of home siding in the
U.S., last month reported a first-half loss that widened on
weaker new home starts, repairs and remodeling in the country.
Interest on the loan to New South Wales, to be repaid by June
30, 2020, will be at a rate equivalent to Australia’s cost of
borrowing.  “The profitability of James Hardie has been affected by
the global financial crisis and that has affected its ability to
make contributions into the fund in recent times,” Gillard
said. “We are giving certainty to James Hardie asbestos victims
that there are funds available to meet their claims.”  Payments by James Hardie into the fund are linked to the
profitability of the company, according to an agreement with New
South Wales, Australian Parliamentary secretary to the
treasurer,  David Bradbury , said in Canberra today. James Hardie
made a payment of A$72 million in 2010, Bradbury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
