U.S. House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi 
criticized the administration’s tax agreement with Republicans,
calling the proposed estate tax changes “a bridge too far.”  The California Democrat, speaking to reporters at the
Capitol, said the estate tax proposal -- which would set the
exemption at $5 million and the top rate at 35 percent for two
years -- wouldn’t create jobs.  Pelosi and the House Democratic caucus will discuss tonight
the agreement that President  Barack Obama  announced with
Republican congressional leaders yesterday. She said that so
far, the Democratic response to the deal “has not been very
good.”  The agreement extends all expiring tax rates for two years.
It also includes a 2 percentage point cut in the payroll tax for
2011, an extension of unemployment insurance through 2011 and
extensions of expired business tax proposals.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
