Ukraine may export about 4 million
metric tons of grain by the end of next March even if the
government lengthens caps on outbound shipments, according to
UkrAgroConsult.  An extension of the limits until March 31 would still allow
traders to ship 1 million tons of grain a month,  Liza Malyshko ,
an analyst at the Kiev-based researcher, said today by phone.
Exporters have made shipments equating to about 11 percent of
the current quotas, she said.  The Economy Ministry yesterday proposed extending the caps,
scheduled to expire Dec. 31, through 2011’s first quarter. It
also suggested adding an extra 1 million tons of corn and
500,000 tons of wheat to the current 2.7 million-ton export
quota. The government imposed the curbs in October after dry
weather damaged crops.  Ukraine has exported 5.3 million tons of grain since the
current marketing year started on July 1, of which 250,000 to
300,000 tons fell under the quota, according to Malyshko. That
leaves about 2.4 million tons to be used, she said.  The current quota comprises 2 million tons of corn, 500,000
tons of wheat and 200,000 tons of barley.  Ukraine’s grain-export potential for the current marketing
year is between 14 million and 15 million tons, depending on
final stockpile calculations by the national statistics office
later this month, Malyshko said.  Export potential in the year may be about 6 million tons
for both corn and wheat and about 3.6 million tons for barley,
according to UkrAgroConsult. Ukraine has shipped 2.22 million
tons of wheat, 2.3 million tons of barley and 440,000 tons of
corn so far in the period, Malyshko said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
