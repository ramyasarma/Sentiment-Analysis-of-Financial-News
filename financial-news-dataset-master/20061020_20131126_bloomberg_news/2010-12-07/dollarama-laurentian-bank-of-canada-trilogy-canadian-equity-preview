Canadian stocks  fell for a second
day, led by mining companies, as precious metal prices declined
on speculation that an extension of U.S. tax cuts will boost
growth and cut demand for alternative investments.  Goldcorp Inc., Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., Barrick Gold Corp. and
Silver Wheaton Corp. were among the biggest contributors to the
drop in the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index . Materials
producers, the third-largest of the index’s 10 industries, fell
2 percent as a group, more than any other.  The S&P/TSX lost 98.67 points, or 0.7 percent, to 13,152 as
of 4 p.m. in Toronto. The main benchmark for Canadian equities
closed at a two-year high on Dec. 6 before slipping yesterday as
gold prices retreated from a record after U.S. President Barack
Obama agreed to extend tax cuts. Gold extended declines today as
the U.S. dollar rose for a third day.  “When you see a significant move in gold like we have
today, that will carry a decent impact to the market,” said
 Philip Petursson , director of institutional equities at MFC
Global Investment Management in Toronto.  Barrick Gold , the world’s largest producer of the metal,
fell 2.2 percent to C$53.47. Goldcorp, the second-largest by
market value, dropped 2.9 percent to C$45.99. Silver Wheaton, a
Vancouver-based purchaser and seller of the metal, declined 2.8
percent to C$38.66.  Gold for February delivery dropped 1.8 percent to $1,383.20
an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Silver for March
delivery slid 5.1 percent to $28.252 an ounce after reaching the
highest price since March 1980 yesterday.  ‘Last Resort’  “In absence of what could be viewed as a very strong
reserve currency, gold is that reserve currency of last resort,
and silver has been playing catch-up to gold,” Petursson said.  Ivanhoe  slumped 15 percent to C$25.28 for the biggest
decline in the S&P/TSX. The Vancouver-based miner with
operations in Asia and Australia gave Rio Tinto Group the right
to boost its stake to 49 percent, making a takeover of Ivanhoe
unlikely, Raymond Goldie, an analyst at Salman Partners Inc. in
Toronto, wrote in a report.  Manulife Financial Corp.  and Toronto-Dominion Bank helped
lead gains in insurance companies and banks as rising yields on
U.S. Treasury securities maturing in 10-years or more improved
the outlook for profit in businesses that are penalized by
declining interest rates.  Manulife, Canada’s largest insurer, rose 4 percent to
C$15.98.  Toronto-Dominion , the country’s second-largest lender,
gained 1.4 percent to C$73.20.  Beating Estimates  Major Drilling Group International Inc . rose 7.1 percent to
C$39.43 for the biggest gain in the index. The metals and
mineral contract drilling service company reported second-
quarter profit excluding some items that topped the average of
six analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey by 39 percent.  Transcontinental Inc.  rose 5.4 percent to C$16.20. Canada’s
largest publisher of consumer magazines reported fourth-quarter
adjusted profit of C$0.77 a share, 18 percent higher than the
average of 7 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Trilogy Energy Corp.  rose 6.5 percent to C$12.12. The oil
and gas producer said it expects production to increase 15
percent next year to 26,500 barrels of oil equivalent a day.  To contact the reporter on this story;
