A Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
401(k) retirement plan and its participants sued ex-Chief
Executive Officer Richard Fuld and other former executives of
the defunct firm for failing to disclose Repo 105 transactions,
a financing method allegedly used to conceal billions of dollars
of debt, according to court records.  The amended lawsuit, based partly on a 2,200-page report by
Lehman bankruptcy examiner Anton Valukas, was filed under seal
in September and ordered unsealed by a judge on Nov. 30,
according to a filing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
