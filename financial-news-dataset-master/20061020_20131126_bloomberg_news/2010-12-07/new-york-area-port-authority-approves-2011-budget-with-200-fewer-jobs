The Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey approved a $7.2 billion budget for 2011 that includes
200 fewer jobs, its third consecutive spending plan with “zero
growth.”  The  budget  reduces the agency’s head count to 6,777, its
lowest in 40 years, eliminates $14 million in contracts with
outside consultants and revokes free E-ZPass toll devices for
agency officials and some employees, saving $1.5 million a year,
the agency’s board said in a  news release . It includes $3.9
billion for capital spending to maintain agency facilities.  The  Port Authority , a bi-state agency created by the U.S.
Congress in 1921, owns and operates five airports, the George
Washington Bridge and three other spans, the Lincoln and Holland
Tunnels, a trans-Hudson River commuter rail line, a midtown-
Manhattan bus station, five shipping terminals and the 16-acre
World Trade Center site in lower Manhattan.  “We continue to hold the line on operating expenses so we
can meet our highest capital priorities,” Port Authority
Executive Director  Christopher Ward  said in a statement.
“Unfortunately, given the severe economic downturn, we have had
to make difficult choices to live within our means.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
