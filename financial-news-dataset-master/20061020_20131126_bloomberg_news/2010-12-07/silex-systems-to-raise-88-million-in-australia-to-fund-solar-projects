Silex Systems Ltd. , an Australian
research and development company, plans to raise A$89.1 million
($88 million) from a share offering to fund solar power projects
and expansion of a manufacturing facility.  The company will offer 16.5 million new shares at A$5.40
each to institutional investors, it said in a statement to the
stock exchange today.  Silex’s Solar Systems Pty unit will use A$69.1 million of
the proceeds to set up a 2-megawatt solar power project at
Mildura in Victoria state and an as-much-as 5-megawatt project
in Nevada, Arizona or New Mexico in the U.S.  Both ventures are pilot plants deploying concentrated
photovoltaic technology, or CPV, designed to make more efficient
use of sunlight than conventional photovoltaic panels through
“concentrating optics.” The funds may also be used to set up
further plants.  Silex Solar will use A$10 million of the proceeds for its
flat panel PV operations, with the remaining A$10 million
earmarked for the Translucent substrate business.  Silex System’s shares, which have gained 28 percent in the
last six months, traded at A$6.41 today before they were halted.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
