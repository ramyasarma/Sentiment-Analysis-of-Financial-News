A New York man accused in a foiled
plot to conduct suicide bombings on the city’s subways last year
sought to suppress statements he made to federal agents after
his arrest.  Adis Medunjanin, in filings in federal court in Brooklyn
yesterday, said he never waived his right to a lawyer. The court
filings don’t mention what Medunjanin told authorities about the
case. Medunjanin pleaded not guilty Aug. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
