Billionaire investor  Warren Buffett ’s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold $500 million of notes to repay debt
maturing next week for its Clayton Homes manufactured home unit.  The 2.45 percent five-year senior notes, issued through
Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corp., yield 85 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Proceeds will repay the finance arm’s existing 4.2
percent senior notes due Dec. 15, the Omaha, Nebraska-based
company said in a regulatory filing.  Buffett’s firm  sells bonds  in part to finance mortgages for
people who buy Clayton’s factory-built housing. The finance unit
tapped demand for corporate bonds after yields on investment-
grade debt fell below 4 percent and two months after Buffett
said that investors “are making a mistake” buying bonds
instead of shares.  In  his yearly letter  accompanying Berkshire’s 2009 annual
report, Buffett said the company will continue backing Clayton’s
home-loan program.  “Even today, though job-loss troubles have grown,
Clayton’s delinquencies and defaults remain reasonable and will
not cause us significant problems,” Buffett, 80,  wrote  in the
letter.  The housing crisis and U.S. unemployment spurred Standard &
Poor’s to cut its outlook on Clayton in April, when the  jobless
rate  reached 9.9 percent. Unemployment, which dipped to 9.5
percent in June, climbed to 9.8 percent last month, the Labor
Department said on Dec. 3.  ‘Stocks are Cheaper’  Buffett was able to lower borrowing costs as yields on
investment-grade corporate bonds dropped to an average of 3.911
percent from 4.011 percent on Dec. 2, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index that tracks more than 4,400 bonds.  While yields have risen from 3.53 percent on Nov. 4, the
lowest level since the index began in October 1986, they’re down
from 4.89 percent at the end of 2009.  “It’s quite clear that stocks are cheaper than bonds,”
Buffett said in October at Fortune magazine’s Most Powerful
Women conference in Washington. “I can’t imagine anyone having
bonds in their portfolio when they can own equities.”  Installment loan balances held by Berkshire’s finance and
financial products division, which includes Clayton, declined
about 2 percent last year to $12.3 billion, according to
Berkshire’s  annual report .  The finance arm issued $500 million of the 4.2 percent
notes in December 2003, and then exchanged the debt for freely
tradable securities in May 2004, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Berkshire Hathaway Finance had $12.1 billion of medium-term
notes outstanding on Dec. 31, 2009, with maturity dates between
2010 and 2018, according to the annual report. Proceeds are used
to finance originated and acquired loans of Clayton Homes.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managed today’s offering,
according to the regulatory filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
