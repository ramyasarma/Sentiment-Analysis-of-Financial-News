Asia gasoline snapped the longest
rally in more than five years. Gasoil’s crack spread fell from
the highest since January 2009 and losses from making fuel oil
widened to the most in 18 months.  Light Distillates  Benchmark  92-RON gasoline  fell 60 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$100.35 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prices ended a nine-day rising streak, the longest rally since
February 2005.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha, or the  reforming margin ,
fell to $7.40 a barrel from $8.30 yesterday, when it was the
widest since Aug. 6, Bloomberg calculations showed. A narrowing
gap indicates naphtha is more valuable to refiners relative to
gasoline.  The premium of naphtha for delivery to Japan to Brent crude
rose to $161.13 a metric ton at 5:58 p.m. in Singapore, Asia’s
biggest oil-trading center, based on Bloomberg data. This crack
spread was $159.19 yesterday.  Open-specification naphtha  for delivery to Japan gained $3,
or 0.4 percent, to $852 a ton, the highest in more than two
years, Bloomberg data showed.  In Singapore, Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. sold 50,000 barrels of
95-RON gasoline loading Dec. 23 to Dec. 27 to Noble Group Ltd.
at $102.20 a barrel, traders said. Glencore International AG
sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for first-half February delivery to
BP Plc at $853.50 a ton.  Middle Distillates  Benchmark  gasoil , or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur fell
50 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $102.65 a barrel, according to
Bloomberg data.  Jet fuel  also dropped 50 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $103.50. Each product ended a three-day climb.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude decreased 24 cents to
$14.58 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil Associates, a
brokerage. The  crack spread , a measure of refining profit,
rallied in the four days to yesterday to reach $14.82, the
widest since January 2009.  In Singapore, China International United Petroleum &
Chemical Corp., or Unipec, bought 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil from
Singapore Petroleum Co. and Total SA, traders said. It received
discounts of 5 cents and 8 cents a barrel to benchmark quotes,
respectively. BP, the biggest buyer of ultra-low-sulfur grade
this year, purchased 170,000 barrels from Glencore at $1.90 a
barrel over quotes. That’s the smallest premium in two weeks.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil declined 5 cents to $1.15 a
barrel, according to PVM. This  regrade  was at the narrowest in
two weeks, indicating aviation fuel is less profitable compared
with diesel.  Fuel Oil  Singapore  180-centistoke fuel oil  declined $6.25, or 1.2
percent, to $510 a ton, Bloomberg data showed. The price of  380-
centistoke fuel oil , mainly used as marine fuel, was down $6.75,
or 1.3 percent, at $499.75. Each product pulled back the most in
two weeks.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or the  crack spread ,
widened for a fourth day to $9.11 a barrel, Bloomberg data
showed. This indicates losses from making the residue were the
biggest since June 2009.  Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. bought 380-centistoke
fuel oil from Kuo Oil Ltd., bringing its purchases in the past
four days to 14 cargoes, or 300,000 tons, traders said. The
price was 25 cents a ton over benchmark quotes. Itochu Corp.
sold a similar cargo to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at minus 25 cents,
the first discount in two weeks.  Refinery News  China Petrochemical Corp., or Sinopec Group, said it
boosted oil processing volume by 40 percent in the past five
years, becoming the world’s second-largest refiner as fuel
consumption surges. China is the world’s biggest energy user.  Oil processing at Sinopec’s refineries rose to an estimated
208 million tons this year, or about 4.2 million barrels a day,
from 149 million tons in 2005, the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
