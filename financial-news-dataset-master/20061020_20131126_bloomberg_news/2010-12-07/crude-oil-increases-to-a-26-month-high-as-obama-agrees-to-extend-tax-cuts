Crude oil tumbled from a 26-month
high after breaching the upper limit of what Saudi Arabia’s oil
minister,  Ali Al-Naimi , said is a satisfactory price for
consumers and producers.  Oil slipped 0.8 percent after surpassing the $70-to-$90-a-
barrel range that al-Naimi announced on Nov. 1. The kingdom had
previously indicated a preferred target of $75 a barrel. Futures
touched $90.76 earlier today following President  Barack Obama ’s
agreement to a two-year extension of tax cuts introduced by
President  George W. Bush .  “The news today has been bullish, but may not be bullish
enough to risk being on the wrong side of the Saudis’ $70-to-$90
range,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche
Bank in Washington.  Crude oil for January delivery declined 69 cents to settle
at $88.69 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
$1.38 gain earlier today took prices to the highest level since
Oct. 8, 2008.  Brent crude oil for January settlement slipped 6 cents to
end the session at $91.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Futures reached $92.86, the highest
level since Oct. 2, 2008.  Prices fell from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. gasoline
supplies surged 4.8 million barrels to 220 million last week,
the biggest one-week gain since Jan. 8. January oil was down
$1.08, or 1.2 percent, to $88.30 a barrel in electronic trading
at 5:04 p.m.  Comfortable Price Range  Most members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, which supplies 40 percent of the world’s oil, have
said they’re comfortable with the new price range.  Libya views $100 as acceptable. OPEC Secretary-General
 Abdalla El-Badri  said prices at $100 wouldn’t necessarily damage
the global recovery or prompt it to increase production unless
accompanied by a supply disruption.  OPEC will meet to review its production quota on Dec. 11 in
Quito, Ecuador. The group hasn’t changed its output target since
2008.  Obama said he would accept lower rates on high earners’
income, dividends, capital gains and multimillion-dollar estates
for the next two years to break a stalemate over extending tax
cuts for middle-class taxpayers. In addition to preserving the
status quo on Bush-era policies, the proposal creates more than
$300 billion in new tax cuts.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 0.3 percent to
1,226.19 at 3:20 p.m. in New York and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  climbed 0.1 percent to 11,376.19.  Technical Trading  The failure to hold above $90 a barrel was also a signal to
technical traders, who look at charts and patterns, to sell oil.  “Buying often dries up after we break through a key
technical level,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “You are seeing the
new longs bail out after the market failed to increase from
today’s highs.” Longs are bets prices will rise.  Futures contracts between December 2011 and September 2012
were in backwardation today, with prices for future months lower
than earlier months. The market had been in contango, when
supplies for nearby delivery are lower than shipments for later
months.  “The most interesting thing we’re seeing is the change in
the curve over the last few days,” said  David Greely , head of
energy research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York.  West Texas Intermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark, will
average $86.08 a barrel next year, up from last month’s forecast
of $85.17,  the Energy Department  said today in its monthly
Short-Term Energy Outlook. Prices in 2010 will average $78.98,
18 cents higher than November’s estimate of $78.80.  Oil Outlook  The department raised its outlook for global oil
consumption next year to 87.78 million barrels a day from 87.77
million last month. The 2010 demand projection increased to
86.35 million, up from 86.33 in November.  “Economic data has been more supportive of the market
recently,” Greely said. “We’re on track to see demand growth
next year and in 2012, led by emerging markets.”  An Energy Department report tomorrow will show that U.S.
crude oil  inventories  declined 1.4 million barrels last week,
according to the median of 16 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey. Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, and gasoline also fell over the
period, the survey showed.  The department is scheduled to release its weekly report at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 927,594 contracts as of 5:03
p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 753,781 contracts yesterday,
8.1 percent above the average of the past three months. Open
interest was 1.37 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
