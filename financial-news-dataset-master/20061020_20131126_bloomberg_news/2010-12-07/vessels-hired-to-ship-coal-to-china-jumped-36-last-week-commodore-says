Vessels chartered to export coal to
China, the world’s biggest energy user, increased by about 36
percent last week, Commodore Research & Consultancy said.  Suppliers may have hired 19 vessels to deliver coal to
China in the seven days ended Dec. 3 from 14 in the previous
week,  Jeffrey Landsberg , president of New York City-based
Commodore Research, said in a note yesterday.  “Chinese thermal coal demand remains robust,” Landsberg
said. The vessels chartered to import thermal coal were also
“moderately higher” than the trailing four-week average, he
said. China is the world’s biggest  coal consumer , using 1.54
billion tons of oil equivalent last year, three times that of
the second-placed U.S., according to data compiled by BP Plc.  Power-station coal prices at Qinhuangdao port, a Chinese
benchmark, fell for the first time in three months after
stockpiles of the fuel surged and the government called for
stability in the cost of commodities.  Coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories per
kilogram slipped 0.6 percent from a week earlier to between 795
yuan ($120) and 810 yuan a metric ton on Dec. 6, according to
data from the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association.  Imports of coal through October this year rose by about 38
percent to 134 million tons, according to China’s Customs
Statistics Information Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
