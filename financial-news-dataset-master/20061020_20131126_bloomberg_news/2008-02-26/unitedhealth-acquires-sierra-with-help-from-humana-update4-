             UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the largest
U.S. health insurer, won Justice Department clearance to acquire
Sierra Health Services Inc., the dominant medical benefits
provider in  Nevada , for $2.6 billion.  
 The Justice Department allowed the deal to proceed after
UnitedHealth agreed to divest policies of more than 25,000
elderly customers in Nevada to  Humana Inc. (HUM)  of Louisville,
 Kentucky , the government said today in a statement. The members
are enrolled in the U.S.-funded Medicare Advantage program.  
 UnitedHealth increased its national medical plan enrollment
by about 630,000, to more than 29.2 million, giving the
Minnetonka, Minnesota-based company a larger role in one of the
fastest-growing regions of the U.S. Humana paid $185 million in
cash for the business shed by UnitedHealth while gaining a
presence in the state.  
 ``This divestiture ensures that senior citizens and others
will continue to benefit from competition between sellers of
Medicare Advantage products,'' said Thomas O. Barnett, the
assistant attorney general in charge of the  Justice Department 's
antitrust division, in the statement. ``We are committed to
preserving competition in the health  insurance industry  because
this competition spurs insurers to lower prices, enhance
services, and offer innovative new products.''  
 Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, who had
opposed the merger, reached a separate settlement in which
UnitedHealth agreed to make $15 million in charitable
contributions to Nevada health groups over the next five years.  
 Forecast  
 UnitedHealth affirmed its previous 2008 forecast of $3.95 to
$4 a share in earnings on $83 billion in revenue.  
 Humana will take over the care of the former UnitedHealth
customers in Nye and Clark counties without changing their
benefit packages or provider networks, Humana said in a
statement. While losing its own Medicare Advantage customers,
UnitedHealth will retain Sierra's estimated 60,000.  
 ``It makes for very strange bedfellows,'' said  Sheryl Skolnick , an analyst with CRT Capital Group in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , in a telephone interview today. ``UnitedHealth's
future now depends on Humana's willingness to save them.''  
 Humana will generate additional revenue of about $275
million and 2 to 4 cents of profit per share, said analyst Matt Perry of Wachovia Securities in a note to clients today.  
 More Customers Sought  
 The original transaction would have given UnitedHealth 94
percent of the Medicare Advantage market in Las Vegas, allowing
the company to raise prices and cut benefits to consumers, the
Justice Department said.  
 UnitedHealth rose 62 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $47.98 in  New
York  Stock Exchange composite  trading . The company is the worst
performer this year in the  six-member  Standard & Poor's 500
Managed Health Care Index.  
 Humana gained 28 cents, or less than a percent, to $69.15.
It has been the top-ranked member of the index for more than a
year.  
 ``This gives UnitedHealth a very strong foothold in a high-
growth demographic area of the country, when growth is hard to
come by,'' said Thomas Carroll, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus &
Co. in Baltimore, in a phone interview before the approval.
``Whereas Sierra alone probably couldn't service a company with
10 locations, one of which is  Las Vegas , now it can be done with
one payer on a national basis.''  
 Advantage Plans  
 Medicare Advantage is the insurance industry's most
profitable product category. Sierra's 60,000 elderly health-plan
members generated about $625 million in 2007, about 35 percent of
the company's  revenue .  
 UnitedHealth had a market-leading 1.37 million members in
Advantage plans on Dec. 31, including the 27,000 in Nevada.
Humana had 1.14 million Medicare Advantage members nationwide,
and none are in Nevada, according to state officials.  
 UnitedHealth agreed to buy Sierra on March 12, 2007, for
$43.50 a share in cash, 21 percent more than Sierra's previous
closing price. Since then, Sierra has traded between $40.11 and
$43.13, reflecting investor uncertainty over whether the
acquisition would be approved.  
 UnitedHealth had $74.3 billion in  revenue  last year, making
it bigger than  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  of Indianapolis. WellPoint has more
members.  
 UnitedHealth, still under U.S. investigation for a 2006
stock options scandal, has been accused by state authorities this
year of claims processing failures in  California  and fraudulent
rate-setting in New York.  
 Opposition  
 Political opposition to the Sierra deal persisted after
Nevada Insurance Commissioner Alice A. Molasky-Arman approved the
acquisition Aug. 27, conditioned on the deal closing by Feb. 29.  
 Critics, including labor unions, physician groups and
hospital industry representatives, complained to U.S. antitrust
regulators that UnitedHealth would monopolize Nevada's medical
services.  
 Opponents sought to stop the merger ``to maintain the really
fragile safety net we've got,'' said Hilary Haycock, a
spokeswoman for the Nevada unit of the  Service Employees
International Union , which represents health-care and government
workers. ``The merger will tear our health-care system apart.''  
 After regulators in neighboring California said Jan. 29 that
they want to fine UnitedHealth up to $1.3 billion for 133,000
alleged violations of rules for handling claims fairly, Nevada's
Republican Governor Jim Gibbons expressed new reservations about
the deal. He called on the Justice Department to act with care.  
 ``A merger of this magnitude could prove to be less than
advantageous to Nevada consumers'' because of the
``overwhelming'' market share UnitedHealth would control, Gibbons
said in a Feb. 1 statement.
