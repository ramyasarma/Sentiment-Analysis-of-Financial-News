             MAN AG Chief Executive Officer Hakan Samuelsson said the second quarter is ``going very well'' as
``dynamic growth'' in eastern  Europe  and the  Middle East  helps
sales at Europe's third-largest truckmaker.  
 ``We are on track to reach full-year goals,'' Samuelsson
told journalists at an investor conference in  Frankfurt  today.
The Munich-based company expects revenue growth in 2007 of 10
percent, he said.  
 A proposed combination with Soedertaelje, Sweden-based
competitor  Scania AB (SCVB)  would make both companies stronger and the
companies will explore ``synergies'' through the end of the year,
Samuelsson said, adding that the climate for talks on closer ties
is ``better.''  
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , the  largest shareholder  in both MAN and
Scania, earlier this year voted down MAN's 10.3 billion-euro
hostile bid for the Swedish truckmaker. Wolfsburg, Germany-based
Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, is seeking a three-way
combination of MAN, Scania and its own commercial-vehicles unit
to create Europe's biggest truckmaker, leapfrogging
DaimlerChrysler AG and  Volvo AB. (VOLVB)   
 Anton Weinmann, the head of MAN's commercial-vehicles
division, estimated June 18 that purchases from Russian customers
will triple this year to ``clearly more than'' 4,000 trucks from
1,570 vehicles in 2006, and that MAN's sales growth in the
country will beat competitors' expansion. The truck and bus unit
accounts for two-thirds of MAN's group revenue.  
 Shares of MAN rose 2.19 euros, or 2.2 percent, to 110.70
euros in Frankfurt, valuing the company at 16.2 billion euros
($21.7 billion).
