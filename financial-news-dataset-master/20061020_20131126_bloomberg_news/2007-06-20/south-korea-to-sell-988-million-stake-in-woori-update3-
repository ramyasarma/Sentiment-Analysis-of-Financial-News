             South Korea's government offered to
sell 5 percent of  Woori Finance Holdings Co. (053000)  for as much as $988
million, trimming its stake in the nation's third-largest
financial firm to recoup funds used in an industry bailout.  
 State-run Korea Deposit Insurance Corp. will sell 40.3
million Woori shares at 22,200 won to 22,750 won, according to a
term sheet sent to investors, a discount of as little as 1.1
percent to today's close. Woori shares have risen 4.1 percent
this year, lagging behind the Kospi Index's 24 percent advance.  
 Korea plans to sell shares in five companies this year,
including Woori and  Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760) , to take advantage
of record stock prices. The money will help the government
recover part of the 108 trillion won ($116 billion) it spent
bailing out the country's financial industry during the 1997-8
Asian regional crisis.  
 ``Institutions will probably show a lot of interest in this
opportunity,'' said Choi Min Jai, who helps manage $1.8 billion
at KTB Asset Management Co. in  Seoul . ``The valuations are very
cheap, and this sale will help dissipate a lot of the overhang
concerns.''  
 Shares of Woori, which posted record profit last year, trade
at 8.2 times estimated earnings, lower than the 9.4 multiple that
rival Kookmin Bank's stock carries or the 9.8 times that Shinhan
Financial Group Ltd. fetches, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Woori's stock jumped 4.8 percent to 23,000 won today.  
 Salvaged Bank  
 The arrangers of the sale include Credit Suisse Group,
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Korea Investment & Securities Co.
and Samsung Securities Co.  
 Korea Deposit Insurance owned 78 percent of Woori as of Dec.
31, according to Bloomberg data. The government said in March
that it would sell a 6 percent stake this year and the rest
gradually, depending on market conditions.  South Korea  created
Woori in 2001 by combining Hanvit Bank and other ailing lenders
that had been salvaged with taxpayers' money.  
 Woori's first-quarter profit doubled to a record 887 billion
won ($956 million) after it sold a stake in credit-card issuer LG
Card Co. Income from loans, bond holdings and other interest-
bearing assets rose 15 percent from a year earlier to 851.4
billion won.
