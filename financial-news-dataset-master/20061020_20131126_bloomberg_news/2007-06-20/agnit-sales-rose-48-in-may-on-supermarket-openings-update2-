             OAO Magnit (MGNT) ,  Russia 's second-largest
supermarket chain, said revenue climbed 48 percent in May after
the company opened 25 more stores.  
 Revenue increased to $285 million, the Krasnodar, Russia-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement. Magnit,
which runs discount food stores, had 1,984 outlets at the end
of the month.  
 Magnit is opening stores in Russian towns with fewer than
500,000 inhabitants to tap rising incomes outside the country's
largest cities. Russia's food retail sales may rise 16 percent
this year to $170 billion, Vitali Podolski, chief financial
officer of X5 Retail Group NV, the country's largest
supermarket company, said yesterday.  
 Magnit shares climbed 67.81 rubles, or 6.5 percent, to
1,110.61 rubles on the Micex Stock Exchange in Moscow, posting
the biggest one-day gain in almost five months. The stock has
risen by more than half in the past 12 months, boosting the
company's market value to 80 billion rubles ($3.1 billion).  
 Revenue rose 55 percent to $1.3 billion in the first five
months of the year, Magnit said today. The company, which plans
to develop a superstore chain in Russia, has most of its
outlets in the southern, central and Volga regions.
