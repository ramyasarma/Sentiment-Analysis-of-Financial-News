             OMV AG (OMV) , central  Europe 's biggest oil
company, plans to establish a natural-gas trading exchange with
OAO Gazprom and other partners as Russia's exporter of the fuel
plans more shipments to western Europe.  
 The two companies, the Vienna Stock Exchange and Centrex
Europe Energy & Gas AG, agreed to turn the Central European Gas
Hub into an exchange, Vienna-based OMV said in an e-mailed
statement today. The exchange will offer spot- and futures-trading
for gas products, according to OMV.
