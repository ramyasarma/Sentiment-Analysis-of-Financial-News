             Standard & Poor’s  is adding
condominiums to its roster of residential housing indexes.  
 The condominium price indexes for the Boston, Chicago,  Los
Angeles ,  New York  and San Francisco areas will be published on
Nov. 25, New York-based Standard & Poor’s said today in a
statement. Standard & Poor’s also said it will publish seasonally
adjusted versions of the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indexes.  
 The condo indexes will use data going as far back as in 1995
and also include seasonally adjusted figures. The S&P/Case-Shiller
 home-price index  of 20 U.S. cities fell 16.6 percent in August
from a year earlier as foreclosures climbed.  
 “Prices for condominiums can behave differently than those
for single family homes,”  David Blitzer , managing director and
chairman of the index committee at S&P, said in the statement.  
 “Having access to a broader range of indices will allow
property owners, investors and others to better understand how
these different residential property types behave, while also
providing a more complete picture of the overall existing
residential property market,” Blitzer said.
