Corn may rise for a sixth straight
week and soybeans may gain on speculation that hot, dry weather
will damage crops in Brazil and Argentina, the two biggest
exporters after the U.S.  Seventeen of 24 traders and analysts surveyed in the U.S.
on Dec. 23 said corn will rise, and 19 of 25 respondents said
soybeans will advance for the fifth time in six weeks. Last
week, corn futures for March delivery climbed 2.9 percent to
$6.14 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean futures
for March delivery rose 3.8 percent to $13.60 a bushel.  Last week’s gains in corn were expected by the majority of
respondents surveyed on Dec. 17, while the soybean rally was a
surprise. Since 2004, the surveys have been correct 53 percent
of the time for corn and 54 percent for soybeans.  Bullish  on corn: 17   Bullish  on soybeans: 19
 Bearish  on corn:  7   Bearish  on soybeans:  6  To contact the reporter on this story:
