Germany’s Foreign Ministry in Berlin
summoned Iran’s ambassador today to express “displeasure” with
the circumstances under which two German journalists have been
detained in Iran, a ministry spokesman said.  Germany’s  Bild am Sonntag  newspaper said family members had
been denied access to both of the detained men. A sister of the
German reporter and the mother of the photographer had flown to
Tehran, where they were barred from meeting the detainees over
Christmas even after Iran had given assurances that a meeting at
the German embassy would be granted. The two journalists work
for Bild am Sonntag.  “We had the firm expectation that there could be a meeting
between the two German detainees and their families over
Christmas,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Bredohl told
reporters at a regular government press conference in Berlin.
“As no such meeting has taken place so far, the Iranian
ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Ministry this morning.”  The Iranian prosecutor overseeing the case said on Nov. 16
that the state can prove the journalists were intent on spying
when they entered the country to gather information on a woman
sentenced to death by stoning.  The two were arrested Oct. 10 after trying to interview the
son of Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, who was sentenced to death by
stoning after her 2006 convictions for adultery and the murder
of her husband.  To contact the reporter on this story:
