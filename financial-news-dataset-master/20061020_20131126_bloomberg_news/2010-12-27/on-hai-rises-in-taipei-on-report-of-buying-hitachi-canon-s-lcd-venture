Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.
shares gained in Taipei trading after a Nikkei newspaper report
that the world’s largest contract manufacturing service firm for
electronics and communication products plans to acquire control
of a liquid-crystal display venture between Japan’s Hitachi Ltd.
and Canon Inc. for 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion).  The stock advanced 0.4 percent to NT117.50 as of 9:04 a.m.
local time, set for the highest close since Dec. 23. The
companies are in final negotiations for Hon Hai to acquire
50 billion yen in each of two private offerings from the
venture over the next two years, dropping Hitachi’s stake from
30 percent from 75.1 percent, according to the report. The unit,
Hitachi Displays, will use the funds to build a plant in Japan
that will start operations in 2012, doubling the unit’s
capacity, the report said.  Hajime Kito, a Hitachi spokeswoman reached by telephone,
said no such decision has been made. Edmund Ding, a spokesman
for Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., didn’t immediately answer
calls to his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
