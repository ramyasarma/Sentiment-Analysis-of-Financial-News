Brazilian economists lifted their
 forecast  for 2011 inflation for a third straight week, according
to the median forecast in a Dec. 24 central bank survey of about
100 economists published today.  Consumer prices will rise 5.31 percent next year, according
to the survey, up from a week-earlier forecast of 5.29 percent.
Prices will appreciate 5.9 percent in 2010, up from a week-
earlier forecast of 5.88 percent, the survey found.  Expectations for 2011 inflation have accelerated from 4.80
percent in August, as the economy grows at its fastest pace in
more than two decades and unemployment has fallen to a series of
record lows. Economists expect the central bank to raise its
benchmark interest rate 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage
point, to 11.25 percent, at its Jan. 18-19 meeting to bring
inflation back towards target.  The bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus
two percentage points.  Gross domestic product  will expand 7.61 percent this year
and 4.5 percent in 2011, the survey found, unchanged from the
previous week’s forecast.  The central bank signaled last week it may start increasing
interest rates next month, after forecasting inflation next year
will be faster than previously expected.  “It is important to highlight that, in an inflation
targeting regime, divergence from the target of the size implied
in these projections suggests the need to implement, in the
short term, adjustments in the benchmark interest rate,” policy
makers said in their quarterly inflation report published Dec.
22.  Inflation in the 12 months through mid-December quickened
to 5.79 percent, the fastest pace in 23 months, on higher food
prices, the national statistics agency said Dec. 21. It was the
fourth consecutive month consumer prices as measured by the
IPCA-15 index exceeded the target.  Unemployment fell to a record low of 5.7 percent in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
