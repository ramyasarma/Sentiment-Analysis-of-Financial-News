China introduced a tax rebate plan
for foreigners shopping in Hainan province in an effort to spur
spending and boost tourism in the tropical holiday resort.  The 11 percent rebate starts Jan. 1 and will apply to
purchases of at least 800 yuan ($121), the Ministry of Finance
said in a statement posted on its  website  today.  The policy is the latest move under a  plan  unveiled by the
Chinese government in December 2009 to build the southern island
of Hainan into an international tourism hub. It is also in line
with government efforts to transform China’s economy into one
driven by consumers rather than spurred by exports.  Tourists from overseas will be able to get the tax rebate
on items including clothes, shoes, watches, jewelry, cosmetics,
medical devices, furniture and home appliances, according to the
statement. Food, alcohol, cigarettes and cars are excluded.  Tourism revenue in Hainan, which attracted 23 million
domestic and overseas visitors last year, may climb almost
sixfold to 124 billion yuan by 2020 from last year, according to
the State Council, China’s Cabinet.  Chinese shoppers will have to wait until May or later to
enjoy the tax rebate, the China Daily newspaper  reported  today,
citing Guo Zhiming, an official with the Hainan government.  The Shanghai Securities News reported Dec. 24 that Chinese
consumers will be able to get their sales tax returned if they
spend no more than 5,000 yuan each time.  -- Zhe Huang  and  Michael Wei . Editors:  Lena Lee ,  Suresh Seshadri .  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
