The New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq Stock Market will operate during normal trading hours
today after snowstorms distrupted transportation across the U.S.
Northeast.  Both exchanges said in emailed statements that they will be
open for trading from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. New York time. Options
markets will also operate during normal trading hours, NYSE
Euronext said. The Big Board said it would continue to monitor
weather and travel conditions and will issue further updates if
conditions warrant.  The U.S. East Coast faces a second day of travel disruption
after snowstorms blanketed cities from New York to Boston,
closing airports and halting trains with waist-high drifts and
blinding winds. New York City’s Central Park had 20 inches (51
centimeters) of snow by 8 a.m. local time as the storm’s center
shifted north and east, the National Weather Service said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
