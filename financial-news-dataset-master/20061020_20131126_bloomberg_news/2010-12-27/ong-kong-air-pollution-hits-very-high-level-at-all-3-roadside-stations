Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at all three of the city’s roadside monitoring
stations, the Environmental Protection Department said on its
website today.  The index was 106 in Central, 104 in Causeway Bay and 106
in Mong Kok as of 6 a.m. local time, the department said.
Roadside pollution above 100 triggers a government warning
for people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
