Brett Favre  hasn’t passed a
concussion test and probably won’t play in the Minnesota
Vikings’ game against the Philadelphia Eagles tomorrow,
 ESPN reported .  The Vikings’ quarterback has no test scheduled before
the National Football League game, making it unlikely he’ll
be cleared to play, the sports network reported citing an
unidentified team official.  Bob Hagan , a Vikings’ spokesman, said in an e-mail
that he hadn’t heard anything about Favre’s playing status.  Favre had an NFL record streak of 297 starts snapped
two weeks ago. He started last week’s game against the
Chicago Bears before suffering a concussion in the second
quarter of the Vikings’ loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
