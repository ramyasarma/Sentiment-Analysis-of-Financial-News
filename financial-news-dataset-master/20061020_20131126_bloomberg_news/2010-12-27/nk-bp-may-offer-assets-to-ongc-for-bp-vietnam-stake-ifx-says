TNK-BP may offer some of its assets
to Oil & Natural Gas Corp. in order to gain the Indian company’s
approval to buy BP Plc’s stake in a Vietnamese project, Interfax
said, citing German Khan, a shareholder and executive director
at the Russian oil producer, which is half owned by BP.  TNK-BP hasn’t decided what assets to offer to ONGC, which
has the right of first refusal to buy BP’s stake after Vietnam
Oil & Gas Group, or PetroVietnam, declined its right, Interfax
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
