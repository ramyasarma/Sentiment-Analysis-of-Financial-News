The French government will
investigate flight cancelations at Charles de Gaulle airport
near Paris in the days leading up to Christmas, Le Figaro
reported, citing environment minister Nathalie Kosciusko-
Morizet.  The newspaper cited the minister as saying that she wants
to establish whether there was a shortage of glycol liquid used
to de-ice aircraft wings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
