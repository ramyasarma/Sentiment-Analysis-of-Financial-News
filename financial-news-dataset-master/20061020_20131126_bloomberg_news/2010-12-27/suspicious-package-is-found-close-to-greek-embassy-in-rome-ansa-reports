Suspicious packages were found at
the Greek and Venezuelan embassies in Rome, four days after two
people were injured when package bombs exploded at two other
diplomatic missions in the Italian capital.  A spokesman for Italy’s Carabinieri police force said the
content of the package found at the Greek embassy was explosive
and a bomb squad is at the scene of the mission, which has been
evacuated.  A Venezuela embassy employee who declined to be identified
confirmed that the mission had received a suspicious parcel on
Dec. 23 with no listed sender and police were now examining it.  Two package bombs exploded on Dec. 23 at the Swiss and
Chilean embassies in Rome, injuring one employee at each
mission, according to police and government officials. The
attacks probably were carried out by anarchists, Deputy Interior
Minister  Alfredo Mantovano  told Milan newspaper Il Giornale in
an interview on Dec. 24.  There are several hundred anarchists in Italy, Mantovano
told the daily.  Rome and other Italian cities have been the scene of
violent student protests against Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi’s legislation that will overhaul the country’s
university system. Italy’s parliament passed the bill Dec. 24.  Rome Mayor  Gianni Alemanno  said the incidents weren’t
related to the recent violence in Rome and the police are
pursuing international leads, according to remarks broadcast on
SkyTG 24 on Dec. 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
