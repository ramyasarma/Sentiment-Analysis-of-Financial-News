German 10-year bonds fell, after the
securities rose last week for the first time since Nov. 5, amid
concern policy makers will step up action to quell Europe’s debt
crisis and damp demand for bunds.  The yield on the  debt  climbed to an almost seven-month
high, while U.S. Treasuries fell as economists said a report
tomorrow will probably show consumer confidence is improving,
adding to speculation that global economic growth will
accelerate next year. Bunds rose last week after Fitch Ratings
cut Portugal’s credit ranking, spurring demand for the perceived
safety of German fixed-income assets.  “People may be taking advantage to lock in some profit
after the rally last week,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-
income analyst at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf, Germany. “There’s a
great deal of uncertainty and for that reason people are taking
a wait-and-see approach.”  The bund yield advanced five basis points to 3.03 percent
as of 3:54 p.m. in London, after reaching 3.06 percent, the
highest since Dec. 16. The 2.5 percent security maturing in
January 2021 declined 0.42, or 4.20 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,314) face amount, to 95.45.  The yield reached 3.08 percent on Dec. 16, the most since
April 29. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield increased four basis
points to 3.42 percent.  Business Confidence  German government bonds returned 6.1 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, as the region’s debt
woes drove investors to seek the safest fixed-income assets.
Greek bonds handed investors a 20 percent loss, the indexes
show. The nation sparked the crisis after the Socialist
government elected in October 2009 said the budget deficit would
be more than twice as large as estimated by the previous
administration. Irish securities tumbled 14 percent.  Still, the  yield  on the 10-year bund has risen almost 1
percentage point since reaching 2.087 percent on Aug. 31, the
lowest on record, as renewed signs of growth and asset purchases
by the Federal Reserve fueled speculation the global economy
will expand next year.  German business confidence increased to a record in
December, the Munich-based Ifo institute said Dec. 17. Dutch
producer confidence improved to 2.5 in December from 0.3 the
previous month, national statistics bureau CBS in The Hague said
on its website today.  “The German mood has never been better,” said  Glenn Marci , a fixed-income strategist at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt.
“If you look at the euro zone as a whole, it doesn’t look too
bad” even with the debt crisis, he said. “Throughout 2011 this
will drive down bunds.”  Consumer Confidence  The U.S. Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence
increased to 56.4 in December from 54.1 in the previous month,
according to the median forecast of 60 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  European Central Bank purchases of government bonds
increased last week to 1.12 billion euros after it settled 603
million euros of deals the previous week, it said today. The
bank said on Dec. 2 that it will extend emergency liquidity
measures after an aid package for Ireland failed to convince
investors that governments will succeed in pushing down their
budget deficits.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  has said governments must
step up efforts to stem contagion and restore confidence and
described the bond program as “temporary.”  Irish 10-year yields were little changed at 9.27 percent
and the yield on similar-maturity Portuguese securities
increased two basis points to 6.86 percent. Spanish 10-year
yields were little changed at 5.50 percent.  Bund yields are heading for a fourth successive monthly
increase, rising 36 basis points from Nov. 30. The yield fell in
each of the first six months of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
