Sony Corp.  will invest 100 billion
yen ($1.2 billion) over the next fiscal year to double its
production capacity for image sensors, as the company aims to
expand output of the devices used in smartphones.  The maker of Cyber-shot cameras will buy back from Toshiba
Corp. a factory making chips used in PlayStation 3 game consoles
and convert the plant into an image-sensor production facility,
Tokyo-based Sony said today in a statement. The company also
plans to add equipment to an existing plant in Nagasaki, western
Japan, to make high-quality image sensors, it said.  The investment follows a plan by Sony, disclosed in
September, to spend 40 billion yen to boost output of so-called
CMOS chips at a factory in Kumamoto prefecture. Japan’s biggest
exporter of consumer electronics aims to win a 30 percent share
of shipments in the market for image sensors used in mobile
phones, compared with about 10 percent for the year ending March
2011, Yoko Yasukochi, a Sony spokeswoman, said by phone today.  Sony’s overall capacity for the devices will be lifted to
50,000 units a month by March 2012 from 25,000 currently,
according to the statement.  Sony  was little changed at 2,960 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in Tokyo, compared with a 0.7 percent advance by the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
