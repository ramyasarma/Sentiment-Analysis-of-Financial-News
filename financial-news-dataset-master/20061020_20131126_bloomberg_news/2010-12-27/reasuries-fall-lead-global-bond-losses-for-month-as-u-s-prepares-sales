Treasuries fell, headed for their
steepest monthly loss in a year and leading a decline in global
bonds, as the U.S. prepared to sell $99 billion of notes
starting today amid signs the economy is improving.  Benchmark U.S. yields advanced to a one-week high as
economists said a private report tomorrow will show consumer
confidence is rising and after China lifted interest rates to
tackle  inflation . Bonds are falling as investors seek greater
returns from stocks, sending shares around the world to their
highest level since before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
bankruptcy in September 2008.  “The global economy recovered this year and will keep
growing in 2011,” said  Hiroki Shimazu , a Tokyo-based economist
at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc., part of Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-largest publicly traded bank
by assets. “There is inflation pressure in the U.S. and in
China. Equities will offer better opportunities than bonds next
year.”  U.S. 10-year yields rose two basis points to 3.41 percent
as of 11:34 a.m. in Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data.
The price of the 2.625 percent security maturing in November
2020 fell 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face amount, to 93 15/32.
The rate was the highest since Dec. 17.  Treasuries have handed investors a 2.4 percent loss this
month, the most since December 2009, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  An index of global bonds including Treasuries, German
bunds, corporate bonds and mortgage securities fell 0.9 percent
in December. It would be the fourth monthly loss, with a total
decline of 2.2 percent, according to the Bank of America
figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
