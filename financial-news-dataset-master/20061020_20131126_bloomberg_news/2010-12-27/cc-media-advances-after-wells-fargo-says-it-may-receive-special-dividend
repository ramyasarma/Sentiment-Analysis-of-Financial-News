CC Media Holdings Inc. , the parent
of the largest U.S. radio broadcaster, rose the most in seven
months after a Wells Fargo & Co. analyst said it may receive a
special dividend from its outdoor-advertising unit.  Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc.  may pay its parent
between $1.41 and $8.06 a share,  Marci Ryvicker , an analyst at
Wells Fargo in New York, said in a note to clients today.  CC Media said Dec. 24 it is exploring alternatives to
improve its capital structure, including new credit facilities,
amendments to existing credit facilities, or the sale of new
debt. The company, based in San Antonio, said it would use the
funds to help refinance existing debt.  “A special dividend is the fastest way to get cash up to
the parent,” Ryvicker said.  CC Media representatives weren’t immediately available to
comment. CC Media is the parent of radio broadcaster Clear
Channel Communications Inc., which was taken private in July
2008 in a $17.9 billion buyout led by Bain Capital Partners LLC
and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP.  Shares of CC Media rose $2.25, or 27 percent, to $10.50 at
3:27 p.m. New York time in over-the-counter  trading , the biggest
gain since May 10. Clear Channel Outdoor, the world’s biggest
billboard owner,  added  23 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $14.17 at
4:02 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
