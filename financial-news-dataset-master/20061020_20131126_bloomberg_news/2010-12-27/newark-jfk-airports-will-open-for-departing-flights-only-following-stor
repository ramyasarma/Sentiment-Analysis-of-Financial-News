John F. Kennedy International and
New Jersey’s Newark Liberty International airports will open at
6 p.m. for departures only, according to the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey, which operates them.  New York’s LaGuardia Airport, also operated by the port
authority, is open and flights are dependent on the airlines
now, said Sara Joren, an agency spokeswoman.  The snowfall that began at midday yesterday left 20 inches
(51 centimeters) of snow in New York’s Central Park by 8 a.m.,
the most for December since 1948, the National Weather Service
said. The storm closed all three airports and forced airlines to
cancel more than 6,000 flights.  JFK closed at 8:17 p.m. yesterday and Newark shut down
about two hours later, according to the  Federal Aviation
Administration  website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
