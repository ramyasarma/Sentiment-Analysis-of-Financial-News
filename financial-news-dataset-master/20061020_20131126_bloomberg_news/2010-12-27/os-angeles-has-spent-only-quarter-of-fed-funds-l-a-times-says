Los Angeles has spent only about
one-quarter of more than $630 million in federal stimulus
grants, and had completed only eight of 108 projects by mid-
October, the Los Angeles Times reported. City officials told the
Times that cost-cutting measures had led to early retirements of
2,400 city workers, 360 had been fired, and many workers
handling stimulus projects were forced to be on furlough 16 to
26 days a year.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
