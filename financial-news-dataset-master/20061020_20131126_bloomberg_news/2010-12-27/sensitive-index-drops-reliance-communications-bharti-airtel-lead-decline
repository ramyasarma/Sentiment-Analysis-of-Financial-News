India’s benchmark stock index fell,
led by telecommunications companies as investors sold after
recent gains.  Reliance Communications Ltd. , the nation’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, dropped 3.5 percent, its biggest loss in
more than two weeks. The stock surged more than 10 percent on
Dec. 24 amid speculation Reliance Industries Ltd. will buy a
stake. Bharti Airtel Ltd., the largest mobile-phone operator,
slid 1.9 percent after gaining 4.7 percent in the last three
trading sessions.  “Investors took money off the table following recent gains
in some stocks, especially in the telecom sector,” said
 Ambareesh Baliga , a Mumbai-based vice president at Karvy Stock
Broking Ltd. “The markets overall seem lackluster as there are
no fresh triggers for investors to act on”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s key  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
lost 44.73, or 0.2 percent, to 20,028.93 at the 3:30 p.m. close
in Mumbai. Companies on the measure are valued at an average 19
times estimated earnings, compared with a recent peak of 20.1
times on Nov. 5. The gauge rose 1.1 percent last week.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange slid
0.2 percent to 5,998.10, while the  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.3
percent to 2,476.12.  Reliance Communications fell the most since Dec. 9 to 137
rupees. Speculation that Reliance Industries may buy a stake
made the phone company the second-biggest gainer on the Sensex
last week. Manoj Warrier, a spokesman for Reliance Industries,
denied the country’s biggest company by market value had bought
a stake in the wireless carrier.  Bharti Airtel  slid the most in a week to 341.90 rupees.  Metal Producers  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the biggest copper
producer, snapped a four-day winning streak, pacing declines
among metal producers. It lost 3.1 percent to 179.30 rupees.  Hindalco Industries Ltd., the aluminum producer that
controls Atlanta-based Novelis Inc., slid 0.8 percent to 237.65
rupees.  Tata Steel Ltd. , the nation’s largest producer of the
alloy, retreated 1.5 percent to 662.55 rupees.  Foreign  funds  sold a net  999 million rupees  ($22.1 million)
of Indian equities on Dec. 23, paring this year’s record flows
in equities to 1.3 trillion rupees, according to data on the
 website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
