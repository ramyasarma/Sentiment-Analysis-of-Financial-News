Russia’s gold production slid 2.2
percent in the first 11 months from the same period last year to
185.5 metric tons, led by a drop in output at mines belonging to
Kinross Gold Corp. and Petropavlovsk Plc.  November production increased by 2.5 tons from the same
month a year earlier, the Russian Gold Producers’ Union said in
a statement today, without being more specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
