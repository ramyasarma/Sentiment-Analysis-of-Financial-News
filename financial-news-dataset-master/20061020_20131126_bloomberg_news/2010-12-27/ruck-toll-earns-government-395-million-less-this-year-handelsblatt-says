Revenue from Germany’s truck tolls
may fall more than 300 million euros ($394 million) below
estimates this year as freight traffic declined,  Handelsblatt 
reported.  Truck-toll receipts may post their first drop since the fee
was introduced in 2005, the newspaper said, citing deputy
transport minister Klaus-Dieter Scheurle. The German government
budgeted 4.5 billion euros of truck-toll gains this year, an
increase from last year’s 4.33 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
