The Slovak agency in charge of state
assets recommended the government sell its 15 percent stake in
the country’s largest telecom, which is controlled by Deutsche
Telekom AG,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported.  The agency proposes to sell the stake in Slovak Telekom AS
through a stock exchange, the newspaper said, citing Miloslav
Homola, an official at the agency called the National Property
Fund.  Deutsche Telekom owns 51 percent of the company, while the
Telecommunication Ministry has another 34 percent, Hospodarske
