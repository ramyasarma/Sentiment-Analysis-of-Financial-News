Attachmate Corp. , the connectivity
solutions provider owned by private-equity firms, is seeking
$1.09 billion in loans to finance its acquisition of  Novell Inc.   Attachmate is seeking an $825 million first-lien term loan,
a $40 million first-lien revolving line of credit and a $225
million second-lien facility, Waltham, Massachusetts-based
Novell said today in a regulatory filing.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Royal Bank of Canada, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and the securities unit of Citadel LLC agreed to
provide the financing, according to the filing.  Francisco Partners LP, Golden Gate Capital Corp. and Thoma
Bravo LLC bought Attachmate in 2005, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The debt commitment will terminate if the initial funding
of the facilities does not occur by April 20 at 5 p.m. New York
time, according to the filing.  Novell agreed to be bought by Attachmate for $2.2 billion,
the company said in a Nov. 22 statement. Novell Investors will
get $6.10 a share. Attachmate also plans to use $425 million in
equity financing to help pay for the acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
