United Nations Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon  condemned Christmas Eve bombings in the central Nigerian
city of Jos that killed at least 32 people and injured more than
50.  “The secretary-general is appalled by the violence that
caused the loss of so many innocent lives,” the UN said in a
 statement  on its website yesterday. Ban “supports efforts by
the Nigerian authorities to bring those responsible to
justice.”  Blasts occurred in three separate locations in Jos, the
capital of Plateau state, on Dec. 24, while attacks on two
churches the next day left six people dead in Maiduguri, capital
of the northeastern state of Borno, according to police. The
government yesterday imposed a 10-hour curfew in Jos, where
sectarian violence between Christians and Muslims this year has
killed as many as 500 people.  Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil producer and the continent’s
most populous nation, has suffered periodic outbursts of
religious and communal violence that have claimed more than
13,000 lives since 1999, according to the Brussels-based
 International Crisis Group .  The attacks in Maiduguri were carried out by Boko Haram, an
Islamic sect operating in the region, state police commissioner
Mohammed Abubakar said on Dec. 25.  Jean Ping , chairman of the  African Union  Commission, also
condemned the “cowardly terrorist attacks.” The AU will support
member states in their efforts to “combat terrorism,” the
commission said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
