Florida’s orange crop, the world’s
largest after Brazil, may be damaged by an overnight frost, said
Anthony Chipriano, a meteorologist at MDA Information Systems
Inc.  “There is a hard-freeze warning from tonight through
tomorrow morning in most parts of Florida,” Rockville,
Maryland-based Chipriano said. Temperatures could fall to as low
as 21 degree Fahrenheit (-6 degree Celsius) in some areas, he
said.  Prices of orange juice surged to a three-year high earlier
this month after Florida declared a state of emergency amid
severe cold and the prospects of crop damage. Last year, the
state produced the second-smallest crop in two decades after a
cold snap in January damaged fruit.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery jumped 4.65 cents,
or 2.8 percent, to $1.686 a pound at 1:44 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Prices touched $1.706 on Dec. 13, the highest
since May 2007. Before today, the commodity gained 27 percent
this year.  “Prices could jump back to this year’s high on tonight’s
frost concern,” said  Fain Shaffer , the president of Infinity
Trading Corp., a commodities brokerage in Medford, Oregon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
