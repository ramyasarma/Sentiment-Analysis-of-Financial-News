Copper futures rose to a record as
inventories declined in China, the world’s largest user,
bolstering speculation that demand will outpace supply.  Stockpiles  monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell
5.8 percent last week, the biggest drop in almost three months.
As of Sept. 30, global consumption exceeded output by 436,000
metric tons this year, the International Copper Study Group said
last week. That compares with a deficit of 56,000 tons in the
same period last year, the group said.  “Demand is pushing new highs while supply remains
reasonably tight,” said Tim Parker, who manages $7.5 billion at
T. Rowe Price Group Inc.’s New Era Fund in Baltimore. “There
are only days of supply in inventories, and there’s so little
new copper coming into the market.”  Copper futures for delivery in March rose 2.15 cents, or
0.5 percent, to close at $4.28 a pound at 1:13 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. Earlier, the metal reached $4.2985, the highest
ever. Prices have surged 49 percent since July 1, partly on
demand from emerging markets including China.  The global market is in “a significant deficit owing to
stronger than anticipated demand growth,” the Lisbon-based ICSG
said.  Copper may touch $5 next year amid falling stockpiles,
Macquarie Bank Ltd. said in a report.  The London Metal Exchange is closed today and tomorrow for
public holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
