U.S. health-insurance costs are
rising more quickly than the ability of U.S. families to pay and
the gap is widening, according to the Commonwealth Fund.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that private-insurance premiums
for families rose three times faster than median household
income over six years, the New York-based non-profit fund said
in a report. Deductibles, the amount that policy holders have to
pay before insurance coverage kicks in, rose almost five times
faster, the fund said.  “Families are being priced out of the market,” said Cathy
Schoen, an economist with the fund, in an interview. “The
consequences are less adequate insurance coverage, costlier
insurance coverage, higher rates of no coverage and growing
stress on the family.”  In 15 states, health-insurance premiums are the equivalent
of at least 20 percent of median household income for people
under 65, according to the report. The data comes from the
government’s Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.  The proportion of U.S. gross domestic product devoted to
health care doubled to 18 percent between 1980 and 2009, Schoen
said. The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,
passed this year, has the potential to benefit families by
reducing pressure on wages and spending, she said.  “Holding onto health insurance is a very expensive
proposition,” she said. “The rapid increase has pulled
resources out of the economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
