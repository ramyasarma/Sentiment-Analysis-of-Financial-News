Polish central bank Governor Marek
Belka broke a tie among members of the rate-setting panel to
approve an increase in the mandatory reserve rate for banks in
October, voting records showed.  The 10-member Monetary Policy Council voted 5-5 for the
motion on Oct. 27, increasing mandatory reserves by half a
percentage point to 3.5 percent, according to the government
bulletin Monitor Sadowy i Gospodarczy. Belka’s vote is decisive
in the case of a tie.  The decision was “a delicate signal of a future tightening
in monetary policy,” Belka said after the Oct. 27 meeting of
policy makers. The same day, the council rejected a motion to
raise the  benchmark interest rate  by half a point, leaving it at
record low of 3.5 percent, according to the minutes from the
meeting.  Poland’s seven-day reference rate has remained unchanged
since the last cut in June 2009.  The council will hold its next meeting on January 18-19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
