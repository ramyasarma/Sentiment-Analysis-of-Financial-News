Air travel in Moscow may remain
disrupted for two more days after freezing rain yesterday
interrupted operations at the two busiest airports in the
Russian capital.  More than 200 flights, or about a third of the daily total
in Moscow, are delayed today at Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo
airports, Sergei Izvolsky, a spokesman for the country’s civil
aviation agency,  Rosaviatsia , said by phone. Moscow air traffic
will return to normal in 48 hours, he said.  A power outage caused by freezing rain yesterday has left
about 300,000 people in the Moscow region without electricity in
near-freezing temperatures, according to the Russian Emergency
Ministry. The inclement weather caused delays to about 105
flights at Domodedovo, stranding thousands of passengers.  Domodedovo Airport resumed operations and is working to
clear a backlog of delayed flights, Elena Galanova, a
spokeswoman for Moscow’s biggest airport, said by phone today.  OAO Aeroflot  and its SkyTeam alliance partners continue to
see delays at Sheremetyevo airport because of difficulties in
treating planes with de-icing fluid, according to Anna
Zakharenkova, a spokeswoman for the airport.  The “extraordinary” downpour last weekend in the capital
amounted to a third of the average monthly precipitation, Moscow
Mayor  Sergei Sobyanin  said on  state television . The municipal
government deployed 15,000 units of snow-clearing equipment,
which helped remove 300,000 cubic meters of snow, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
