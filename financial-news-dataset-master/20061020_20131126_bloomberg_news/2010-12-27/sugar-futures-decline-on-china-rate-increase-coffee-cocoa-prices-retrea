Sugar had the biggest drop in almost
three weeks after China increased interest rates, raising
concern that demand for commodities may decline. Coffee and
cocoa gained.  The People’s Bank of China boosted its one-year lending and
deposit rates by 25 basis points on Dec. 25. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials declined as much
as 0.8 percent before paring losses. On Dec. 23, sugar futures
reached 34.06 cents a pound, the highest for a most-active
contract since November 1980. U.S. markets were closed Dec. 24
for a public holiday.  “The market is reacting to the China news,” said  Jeff Bauml , a senior vice president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a
broker in New York. “Also, there is some technical selling.”  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.34 cent, or 1 percent,
to settle at 33.64 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York, the biggest decline since Dec. 7. The most-active
contract has gained 25 percent this year.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery rose 1.55 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.3745 a pound. The price has jumped 75
percent this year.  Cocoa futures for March delivery advanced $20, or 0.7
percent, to $3,040 a metric ton. The price has gained 8.3
percent this month on concern that political unrest may disrupt
supplies in Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest producer.  This year, the commodity is down 7.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
