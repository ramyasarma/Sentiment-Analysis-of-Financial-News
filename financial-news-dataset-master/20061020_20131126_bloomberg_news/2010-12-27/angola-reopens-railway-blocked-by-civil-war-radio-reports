Angola reopened a railway between
the capital, Luanda, and the northeastern city of Malange 18
years after it was halted by the southern African nation’s civil
war, Radio Nacional de Angola reported, citing the director of
Luanda railways, Osvaldo Lobo do Nascimento.  The nine-hour inaugural trip on the 424-kilometer (263-
mile) railway started from Luanda this morning carrying
officials from the Ministry of Transport and executives of
Chinese company that rebuilt the railway, the radio reported.
Commercial service will start on Jan. 13, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
