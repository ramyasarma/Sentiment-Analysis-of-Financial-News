Trina Solar Ltd. , a Chinese solar-
energy company that uses Massachusetts Institute of Technology
research, plans to invest $800 million over three years to
expand its factories and boost development.  The photovoltaic-materials maker aims to “accelerate the
advancement and delivery of new technologies and products to
solidify our position as a global PV industry leader,” Chief
Executive Officer  Jifan Gao  said today in a statement.  The investment will be directed at its Trina PV Park
facility. Trina, based in Changzhou near Shanghai, reiterated
its forecast for 2010 solar module shipments to be about 1
gigawatt, a 151 percent increase from 2009.  In July, Trina said it entered a liaison program with MIT
to give the company access resources and research.  To contact the reporters on this story:
