Austria’s energy-related carbon
discharges fell 7.4 percent last year because of the economic
crisis, more than the preliminary estimated decline of about 4
percent, the Wifo research institute said.  Carbon-dioxide emissions linked to energy production and
consumption declined by 4.75 million metric tons to 59 million
tons, based on data from the country’s statistical office and
the Federal Environment Agency, Wifo said today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
