India paid at least 459 million
rupees ($10 million) in subsidies to help rural homes and
villages install solar-powered lights in 2010.  A government program promoting the use of lights powered by
photovoltaic cells installed 78,408 portable lanterns and
108,599 home-lighting systems, the Ministry of Renewable Energy
said in a statement today.  The ministry provided a subsidy of 2,400 rupees for each
solar lantern, which typically runs off batteries, and anywhere
from 2,500 rupees to 8,660 rupees for each home-lighting system
depending on the model installed and the type of user, it said.  More people in India lack access to electricity than any
other nation, according to the International Energy Agency. The
government is promoting standalone renewable energy projects,
including 2,000 megawatts of decentralized solar plants by 2022,
to help plug gaps in its electricity grid.  A $2 billion-a-year market for clean-energy products such
as solar-powered lanterns may exist among India’s rural poor who
want dependable, energy-efficient devices, according to a
September report funded by ICICI Bank Ltd., India’s second-
largest bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
