Cattle futures rose for the sixth
straight session on signs that U.S. beef demand is climbing.
Hogs also gained.  The price of wholesale  choice beef  rose the most in five
weeks, and the average spot-market  steer  last week climbed 2.8
percent from a week earlier, government data showed. Meatpackers
may bid for more livestock next week after running shorter hours
for the Christmas and New Year’s holidays, said  Tom Tippens , the
president of West Oak Commodities Inc. in Weatherford, Oklahoma.  “The higher cash price that was accomplished last week was
a little bit surprising,” Tippens said. “Packers do have to
buy for a full kill week next week, so that’s put them a bit
more in need to buy cattle.”  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.375 cent, or
0.3 percent, to settle at $1.0795 a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. On Dec. 22, most-active contract
reached $1.088, the highest since Aug. 7, 2008. The commodity
has advanced 25 percent this year.  Wholesale choice beef gained 1.1 percent at midday to
$1.6059 a pound, Department of Agriculture data show. Spot-
market steer prices averaged $1.0251 a pound last week.  Earlier, futures fell as much as 0.3 percent on speculation
that beef sales at U.S. restaurants will slow this week after
snowstorms slammed the U.S. East Coast.  “Those are lost sales the restaurant never gets back,”
said  Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler Commodities LLC in
Augusta, Kansas. “You’re not going to go out Friday and eat two
steaks to make up for the one you didn’t go out and eat
tonight.”  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement were unchanged
at $1.23675 a pound. On Dec. 22, the price reached $1.2415, the
highest since the commodity started trading on Nov. 30, 1971.  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.125 cent, or 0.2
percent, to 78.85 cents at a pound. On Dec. 23, the price
reached 79.1 cents, the highest since Aug. 19. The commodity has
gained 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
