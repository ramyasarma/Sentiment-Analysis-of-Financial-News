Treasury two-year securities fell,
pushing yields to a six-month high, as the U.S. prepared to sell
$35 billion of the debt in the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion.  Shorter-term notes also dropped before a report tomorrow
forecast to show  consumer confidence  rose this month and after
China raised borrowing costs to contain inflation. A winter
storm blanketing New York City with 20 inches (51 centimeters)
of snow slowed trading, investors said.  “Supply pressures and the China story are weighing on
Treasuries on the margins, but today is all about low liquidity,
the post holiday hangover and the snowstorm that is leading to
very light trading this morning,” said  Guy LeBas , chief fixed-
income strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
in Philadelphia.  The two-year note yield increased seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 0.72 percent at 9:47 a.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 0.50 percent
security maturing in November 2012 fell 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 99 18/20.  The yield on the two-year note reached the highest level
since June 21. The benchmark 10-year note yield increased three
basis points to 3.41 percent. The 30-year bond yield was little
changed at 4.48 percent.  Treasuries have handed investors a 2.4 percent loss this
month, the most since December 2009, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Pre-Auction Trading  Two-year notes yielded 0.734 percent in pre-auction
trading, rising from 0.52 percent at the prior sale on Nov. 22.
Investors  bid  for 3.70 times the amount offered last month,
compared with the average of 3.31 for the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders,  the category of investors including
foreign central banks, bought 38.3 percent of the notes, versus
the 10-sale average of 37.6 percent.  The U.S. also plans to sell $35 billion of five-year debt
tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year securities on Dec. 29.
The sizes are unchanged from last month.  The Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence
increased to 56.5 in December from 54.1 in the previous month,
according to the  median  forecast of 59 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The report from the New York-based research group
is due at 10 a.m. New York time tomorrow.  China boosted borrowing costs on Dec. 25, increasing the
benchmark  one-year lending rate  by 25 basis points to 5.81
percent. It lifted the one-year deposit rate by the same amount
to 2.75 percent.  Ried Thunberg View  Fund managers in a weekly survey by Ried Thunberg ICAP Inc.
became more bearish on the outlook for Treasuries through March.  Ried’s sentiment index declined to 46 for the seven days
ended Dec. 23 from 48 the week before. A figure of less than 50
indicates investors expect prices to fall.  The company, a unit of the world’s largest interdealer
broker and based in Jersey City, New Jersey, surveyed 17 money
managers controlling $1.26 trillion.  Wall Street’s biggest bond-trading firms say investors in
U.S. government debt will barely break even next year as yields
climb from the lowest levels since the 1950s and the Federal
Reserve boosts economic growth through its second round of so-
called quantitative easing.  Investors buying benchmark 10-year notes will gain about 1
percent in 2011 once interest payments are re-invested, as the
yield rises to 3.65 percent after averaging  3.2 percent  in 2010,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of the Fed’s 18 primary
dealers.  “QE2 has had unforeseen benefits in raising risk appetites
and improving confidence,” said  Mark MacQueen , a partner at
Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory Services, which oversees
$9.5 billion. “At best it’s going to be a mediocre year, but
not negative” for Treasuries, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
