Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts rose after economists increased their
2011 inflation forecast for a third week.  The yield on the contract due in July 2012 added two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.4 percent. The yield on
futures maturing in January 2012 held at 12.15 percent after
earlier climbing to 12.18 percent, the highest intra-day level
since Dec. 2. The real rose 0.3 percent to 1.6859 per dollar.  Consumer prices will rise 5.31 percent next year, according
to the median forecast in a Dec. 24 central bank survey of about
100 economists published today, up from a week-earlier forecast
of 5.29 percent. Economists predicted the central bank will
boost its benchmark interest rate 50 basis points to 11.25
percent at its Jan. 18-19 meeting.  “There was a change in the projection for 2011, confirming
the rising trend in expectations,”  Silvio Campos Neto , chief
economist at Banco Schahin SA in Sao Paulo, said in a phone
interview. “This reinforces the trend of rate increases in the
beginning of the year.”  Economists increased their forecast for 2011 inflation from
4.80 percent in August as the economy grows at its fastest pace
in more than two decades and unemployment hits record lows.  Inflation  in the 12 months through mid-December quickened
to 5.79 percent, the fastest pace in 23 months. The central bank
targets annual inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  President  Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva told reporters in
Brasilia today that inflation isn’t a concern and expectations
for price increases in 2011 are “within target.”  Traders’ Bets  The central bank signaled last week it may start increasing
interest rates next month to “contain the mismatch” between
the expansion of domestic demand and supply.  Traders are wagering that the central bank will raise its
benchmark interest rate 50 basis points to 11.25 percent at its
Jan. 18-19 meeting and bring the rate to about 13 percent by the
end of next year, according to calculations by Bloomberg based
on the interest-rate futures.  An increase in borrowing costs of 150 basis points would
slow inflation to between 4.5 percent and 4.8 percent by the end
of 2011, assuming the real remains stable,  Carlos Hamilton , the
central bank economic policy director, told reporters last week.  On Dec. 3, policy makers raised reserve and capital
requirements to rein in credit growth. The central bank
estimates that the measures are equivalent to lifting the
benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage point to a full point,
a person familiar with the bank’s decision-making process told
Bloomberg on Dec. 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
