Treasuries advanced after the U.S.
government’s $35 billion auction of two-year securities drew the
highest level of demand in three months.  Primary dealers, attracted by a six-month high in yields,
bought their biggest share of a two-year note offering since
August. A holiday storm blanketing New York City with 20 inches
(51 centimeters) of snow slowed trading and exaggerated price
swings, investors said.  “The two-year note auction got really cheap on nothing,
and the usual response to that is to take advantage of it,”
said  David Ader , head of government bond strategy in Stamford,
Connecticut, at CRT Capital Group LLC. “Prices have gotten very
cheap, and people are starting to take notice.”  The 10-year note yield dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 3.33 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 2.625
percent security maturing in November 2020 increased 14/32, or
$4.38 per $1,000 face amount, to 94 3/32.  The two-year note  yield  erased its advance, falling less
than one basis point to 0.64 percent after climbing seven basis
points to 0.72 percent, the highest level since June 21. The 30-
year bond yield decreased seven basis points to 4.40 percent.  The bid-to-cover ratio at today’s two-year note auction,
which compares total bids with the amount of securities offered,
was 3.71, the highest since a reading of 3.78 on Sept. 27.  Primary dealers bought 57.6 percent of the auction, the
most since Aug. 24. Indirect bidders, an investor class that
includes foreign central banks, purchased 22.6 percent of the
notes, the lowest level since May 2008.  ‘In the Playpen’  “The two-year note auction went very well as primary
dealers were in the playpen by themselves, so they were able to
send the yield higher before the auction and buy cheaply,”
 William O’Donnell , head U.S. government bond strategist in
Stamford at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc’s RBS Securities Inc.
“We may see that pattern continue this week as other investors
may be staying away until the new year.” As one of the 18
primary dealers, RBS is obligated to participate in U.S.
government auctions.  The 0.625 percent securities maturing in December 2012
produced a yield of 0.740 percent, compared with an average
forecast of 0.761 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven
primary dealers.  Treasury five-year notes drew a yield of 2.063 percent in
pre-auction trading before tomorrow’s sale, compared with a
yield of 1.411 percent at the Nov. 23 offering. The U.S. also
plans to sell $29 billion of seven-year securities on Dec. 29.
The sizes of this week’s note auctions are unchanged compared
with last month’s.  Outlook in 2011  Wall Street’s biggest bond-trading firms say investors in
U.S. government debt will barely break even next year as yields
climb from the lowest levels since the 1950s and the Federal
Reserve boosts economic growth through its second round of
quantitative easing.  Investors buying benchmark 10-year notes will gain about 1
percent in 2011 once interest payments are re-invested, as the
yield rises to 3.65 percent after averaging 3.2 percent in 2010,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of primary dealers.  “QE2 has had unforeseen benefits in raising risk appetites
and improving confidence,” said  Mark MacQueen , a partner at
Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory Services, which oversees $9.5
billion. “At best it’s going to be a mediocre year, but not
negative” for Treasuries, he said.  More Fed Buying  The Fed may expand its purchases of Treasuries beyond its
$600 billion target, said  Vincent Reinhart  , who was the Fed’s
chief monetary-policy strategist from 2001 until September 2007.  “They do all of QE2 because they don’t want to be seen as
succumbing to outside pressure,” Reinhart, now a scholar at the
American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart” with Carol
Massar. “There is a chance there will be QE3 and it is going to
be because the unemployment rate is above 9 percent,” he said,
referring to a third round of purchases.  Fund managers in a weekly survey by Ried Thunberg ICAP Inc.
became more bearish on the outlook for Treasuries through March.  Ried Thunberg’s sentiment index declined to 46 for the
seven days ended Dec. 23 from 48 the week before. A figure of
less than 50 indicates investors expect prices to fall.  The company, a unit of the world’s largest interdealer
broker and based in Jersey City, New Jersey, surveyed 17 money
managers controlling $1.26 trillion.  Treasuries have handed investors a 2.4 percent loss this
month, the most since December 2009, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
