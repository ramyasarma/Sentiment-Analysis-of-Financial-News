Acino Holding AG said a Norwegian
court’s ruling against it in a case involving a generic version
of the oxycodone medicine may cost the company about EU4 million
if upheld. The company confirmed its full-year outlook, saying
that an extraordinary contribution to net profit from the
acquisition of the iclaprim business is expected to compensate
for a provision for the ruling.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
