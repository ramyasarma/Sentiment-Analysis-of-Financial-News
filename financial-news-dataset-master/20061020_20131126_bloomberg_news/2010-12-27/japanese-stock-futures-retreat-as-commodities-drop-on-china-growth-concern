Japanese  stock   futures  fell as
China’s interest-rate increase stoked concern economic growth
will slow and dragged down commodity prices.  American depositary receipts of  Advantest Corp. , the
world’s biggest maker of chip-testing equipment, lost 1 percent
from the closing share price in Tokyo. Panasonic Corp., an
electronics maker that gets more than 25 percent of its sales in
China and other Asian countries, slid 0.2 percent. Mitsubishi
Corp., Japan’s largest commodities trader, dropped 0.7 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 10,315 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,350 in Osaka. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,310 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time.  “China’s interest rate increase was mostly priced in
yesterday in Japan, but if there are corrections in other
markets, Japanese stocks will be influenced,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi  a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.
“Trading volume is getting thin, and moves in the stock market
will be limited.”  The Trade Ministry announced industrial production jumped
5.8 percent year-on-year. Japan’s statistics bureau reported the
nation’s unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.1 percent and
consumer prices fell 0.5 percent in November, indicating
deflation persists.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. In New York, the index gained less than 0.1

billion in bank credit lines. U.S. stocks had declined as much
as 0.4 percent in early trading after China increased the key
one-year lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points on Dec. 25
in its second move since mid-October.  China Shares  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
the country’s stock exchanges, declined 1.9 percent, reversing

yesterday in 2010, compared with gains of 12.8 percent by the
S&P 500 and 9.96 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 14.7 times for the S&P 500
