Wall Street’s biggest bond-trading
firms say investors in U.S. government debt will barely break
even next year as yields climb from the lowest levels since the
1950s and the Federal Reserve boosts economic growth.  Investors buying benchmark 10-year notes will gain about 1
percent in 2011 once interest payments are re-invested, as the
yield rises to 3.65 percent after averaging  3.2 percent  in 2010,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of the Fed’s 18 primary
dealers. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Treasury Master
index returned 8.15 percent annually since its start in 1978.  Average yields on 10-year notes are already the lowest
since 1956, when  Dwight D. Eisenhower  was president, according
to “A History of Interest Rates” by  Sidney Homer  and  Richard Sylla  and data compiled by Bloomberg. Even though bonds declined
the most in a year this month, the dealer estimates show Wall
Street anticipates stable inflation as the Fed’s policy of
purchasing Treasuries through so-called quantitative easing
stimulates growth and demand for riskier assets.  “QE2 has had unforeseen benefits in raising risk appetites
and improving confidence across the board,” said  Mark MacQueen ,
a partner at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory Services, which
oversees $9.5 billion. “At best it’s going to be a mediocre
year, but not negative” for Treasuries, he said.  Heartbreak Hotel  Treasuries have returned 5.28 percent this year even after
December’s 2.39 percent drop, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data. That compares with a loss of 3.72 percent
last year and a gain of 14 percent in 2008, when investors
worldwide sought U.S. government debt as a refuge during the
financial crisis.  Ten-year  note yields  rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.43 percent as of 12:23 p.m. in London.
The price of the 2.625 percent security maturing in November
2020 fell 10/32, or $3.125 per $1,000 face amount, to 93 10/32.  The average 10-year yield was the lowest this year since
 Elvis Presley  first entered the music charts with “Heartbreak
Hotel” and Eisenhower defeated  Adlai Stevenson  for a second
term. Rates reached a 2010 high of 4 percent on April 5 and
dropped as low as 2.33 percent on Oct. 8.  The average 3.07 percent rate in 1956 accompanied economic
growth of 1.8 percent, consumer price gains of 3 percent and an
unemployment rate that fell to 4.1 percent. In 2010’s third
quarter, the U.S. expanded at a 2.6 percent pace, the Commerce
Department said Dec. 22. Inflation rose at a 1.1 percent annual
rate in November, while unemployment climbed to 9.8 percent.  Economic Outlook  U.S. growth will slow to 2.6 percent next year from 2.8
percent in 2010, according to the median estimate of 69
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The consumer price index
is forecast to rise 1.5 percent, a separate survey showed.  Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and prospects for subdued
inflation make Treasuries attractive, according to  Gary Pollack, 
who helps oversee $12 billion as head of bond trading at
Deutsche Bank AG’s private wealth management unit in New York.
Portugal was cut to A+ from AA- on Dec. 23 by Fitch Ratings,
which cited a slow reduction in the nation’s current account
deficit and a difficult financing environment.  “The Fed is buying through June and the outlook for
inflation is rather benign,” said Pollack, who is purchasing
Treasuries maturing in four to six years. “There are still
question marks about the economy, which will keep growth below
trend and support lower yields.”  Debt Auctions  Demand at Treasury auctions has held near record levels
even as bonds fall and the administration of President  Barack Obama  predicts the fiscal 2011 budget deficit will top $1
trillion for a third consecutive year.  Investors bid about $2.96 for each dollar of Treasuries
sold last month, near the $3.19 peak in September and the $2.99
average through November, Treasury data show. The so-called bid-
to-cover ratio was 2.5 in U.S. note and bond sales last year.  Primary dealers, who are required to bid at debt auctions,
reduced their  Treasuries  to $30 billion as of Dec. 15, from a
2010 high of $81.3 billion on Nov. 24, according to Fed data.
That suggests they’re confident the U.S. will avoid falling back
into a recession, said  Jason Brady , a managing director at
Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which
oversees about $72 billion in assets.  “What we’ve gotten is marginally better economic news and
that’s made Treasuries a less-favored holding,” Brady said.  Wrong Prediction  Dealers predicted at the end of last year that the median
yield on 10-year notes would rise to 4.14 percent in 2010. They
were more accurate in  2009,  forecasting an increase from the
all-time lows reached after the September 2008 bankruptcy of New
York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. froze credit markets.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., this year’s most accurate
forecaster among the dealers, had predicted the yield would end
2010 at 3.25 percent. Morgan Stanley, the most bearish
forecaster, said the 10-year rate would rise to 5.5 percent.  James Caron , head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at New
York-based Morgan Stanley, now predicts 4 percent by the end of
2011 after acknowledging in August that the firm’s estimates for
economic growth and yields were too high.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 8.3 percent from the
start of 2010 through July 2 on concern the economic rebound was
deteriorating. The benchmark index for U.S. equity has since
surged 23 percent, bringing the year’s advance to 13 percent, as
industrial production, consumer confidence and retail sales
signaled the recovery was gaining momentum and investors
anticipated the Fed would begin a second round of bond purchases
to sustain growth.  Mutual Fund Flows  Investors removed $8.62 billion from U.S. fixed-income
funds in the week ended Dec. 15 as bonds fell and stocks
rallied, up from a $1.66 billion outflow the week before, the
Investment Company Institute said Dec. 22. Bond funds had taken
in $234.8 billion through Oct. 31 and $306.7 billion in 2009,
according to the Washington-based trade group. Last week’s
withdrawals were the largest since the week ended Oct. 15, 2008,
when investors took out $17.6 billion.  Bill Gross , who oversees Pacific Investment Management
Co.’s $250 billion Total Return Fund, the world’s biggest bond
 fund,  said in October that asset purchases by the Fed probably
mean the end of the 30-year rally in bonds. The Newport Beach,
California-based firm this month raised its forecast for U.S.
growth next year as President Obama agreed to extend current
rates for high-income taxpayers for two more years and reduce
the payroll tax by $120 billion for one year.  ‘Same Issues’  Pimco said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
filing that the fund may invest in equity-linked securities for
the first time since 2003.  Even with growth picking up, the central bank will leave
its  rate  for overnight loans between banks unchanged in a range
of zero to 0.25 percent through 2011, according to the primary
dealers in this year’s survey.  Edward McKelvey , senior U.S.
economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, said that should help
keep yields from surging as growth accelerates.  “The markets will live some of the same issues in 2011
that they had in early 2010, which is perennial expectations
that the Fed will tighten,” said McKelvey, who projects 10-year
notes will yield 3.75 percent at the end of 2011. “In the end,
we don’t see policy changes, but we will have a diet of data
that will feed that perception. Our forecast is for strong
growth, low inflation and no Fed tightening.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
