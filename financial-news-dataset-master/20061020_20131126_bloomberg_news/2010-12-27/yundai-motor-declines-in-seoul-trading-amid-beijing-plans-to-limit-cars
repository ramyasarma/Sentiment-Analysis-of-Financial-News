Hyundai Motor Co. fell for a second
day after the city of Beijing decided to limit the number of new
passenger vehicles in the Chinese capital to ease congestion.  South Korea’s biggest automaker declined 2.8 percent to
173,500 won as of 10:54 a.m. on the Korea Exchange, while the
benchmark Kospi stock index fell 0.3 percent. Affiliate Kia
Motors Corp. declined 2.3 percent.  “Beijing’s move to limit the number of new cars as well as
China’s fresh monetary tightening have raised some concern about
demand there and are affecting sentiment today,” said Song
Seong Yeob, a fund manager at KB Asset Management Co. in Seoul,
which oversees the equivalent of $17 billion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
