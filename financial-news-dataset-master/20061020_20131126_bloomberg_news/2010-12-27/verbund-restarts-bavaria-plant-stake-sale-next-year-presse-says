Verbund AG, Austria’s biggest
utility, will restart the sale of a stake in its Bavarian
hydropower plant unit in the first half of next year, Austrian
daily newspaper Die Presse reported today, citing Chief
Executive Wolfgang Anzengruber.  The utility may sell less than the originally planned 30
perent of the unit, Anzengrubder told Die Presse. He also
doesn’t expect to sell individual plants, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
