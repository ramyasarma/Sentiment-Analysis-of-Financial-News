European stocks retreated after the
longest stretch of weekly gains for the benchmark Stoxx Europe
600 Index since April.  Daimler AG  and Volkswagen AG tumbled more than 4 percent
after China, the world’s largest car market, raised interest
rates for the second time in just over two months. Bankinter SA
led banks lower, sliding 4.3 percent as the number of mortgages
issued for Spanish homes plunged.  The  Stoxx 600  slid 0.8 percent to 279.18 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Frankfurt, as almost four companies fell for every one
that gained. The gauge has climbed for four straight weeks,
extending this year’s advance to 10 percent, as better-than-
estimated U.S. economic data overcame concern about Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis. The index last week climbed to the
highest since before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. in September 2008.  “People are starting to think that markets may have been
overbought so it might be a good opportunity to take some profit
by year end,” said London-based  Zahid Mahmood , senior dealer at
London Capital Group. “We’ve also had the unexpected interest
rate rise from China and there is concern other countries may
possibly follow next year.”  National benchmark indexes declined in all 16 western
European markets that were open except Iceland. France’s CAC 40
slid 1 percent and Germany’s  DAX  dropped 1.2 percent. The U.K.
and Ireland were closed for a public holiday.  Volatile Start  Low volumes contributed to a volatile start to today’s
European trading. Futures on the  Euro Stoxx 50  lost 62 points,
or 2.2 percent, in just over one minute following the 9 a.m.
start of equity trading in Frankfurt. Deutsche Boerse AG’s Eurex
exchange imposed a five-minute volatility interruption, or
circuit breaker, on the contracts at 9:05 a.m. to permit an
orderly reassessment of prices, said Frankfurt-based  Heiner Seidel , spokesman for the derivatives exchange.  Volume traded in DAX shares was about a third of the daily
average for the past six months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The People’s Bank of China said in a statement on its
website on Dec. 25 that the benchmark one-year lending rate will
increase by 25 basis points to 5.81 percent and the one-year
deposit rate will climb by the same amount to 2.75 percent.  China’s monetary tightening in 2011 may be mainly in the
first half as officials tackle the fastest inflation in more
than two years, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley said.  Automakers Decline        Daimler , the world’s second-biggest maker of luxury cars,
lost 4.6 percent to 51.57 euros. Volkswagen’s preferred stock
fell 4.8 percent to 122 euros, while PSA Peugeot Citroen dropped
2.1 percent to 28.84 euros.  An index of auto shares fell 3.9 percent, the biggest
decline among 19  industry groups  in the Stoxx 600. The city of
Beijing last week introduced measures including limiting the
number of new passenger vehicles to ease congested roads.  Separately,  Volkswagen  said its Audi unit aims to add 1,200
new positions in 2011 and invest 11.6 billion euros ($15.3
billion) by 2015 in what it described as the biggest investment
program in the company’s history.  Bankinter lost 4.3 percent to 4.21 euros after Spain’s
National Statistics Institute said the number of mortgages
issued for Spanish homes in October dropped 24 percent, the most
since April 2009, as the expiry of a tax incentive at year-end
approached.
       Banco Santander SA , Spain’s largest bank, dropped 2.9
percent to 7.89 euros while smaller rival Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA lost 2.3 percent to 7.63 euros.  Capital Increase  Gestevision Telecinco SA dropped 5.4 percent to 8.36 euros
after shareholders approved a 573 million-euro capital increase
to pay for Cuatro, the free-to-air channel being sold by
Promotora de Informaciones SA.  SSAB AB  climbed 3.5 percent to 111.5 kronor after Sweden’s
largest steelmaker was raised to “accumulate” from “reduce”
at Svenska Handelsbanken AB.  DNO International ASA, a Norwegian oil company that is
operating in the Kurdish region of Iraq, jumped 6.7 percent to
9.39 kroner. Iraq’s new central government plans to approve oil
and gas production contracts signed by the regional Kurdish
government, The National reported, citing Oil Minister  Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
