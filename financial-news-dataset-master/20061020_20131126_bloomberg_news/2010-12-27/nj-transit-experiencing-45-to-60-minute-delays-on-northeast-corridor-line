New Jersey Transit said Northeast
Corridor service is operating to and from Newark Penn Station
only with delays of 45 minutes to 60 minutes in both directions
because of signal problems near New York. The agency, which
commented in an e-mailed statement, earlier reported that
service between Newark and New York was suspended.  Amtrak separately reported in an e-mailed statement that
signal problems are causing delays into and out of New York Penn
Station.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
