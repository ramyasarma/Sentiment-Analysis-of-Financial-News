The New York Stock Exchange plans to
open for trading as normal today and no disruptions have been
reported as of 7:25 a.m. local time, according to Scott Derta, a
member of the exchange’s customer support team.  The U.S. East Coast faces a second day of travel disruption
after snowstorms blanketed cities from New York to Boston,
closing airports and halting trains with waist-high drifts and
blinding winds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
