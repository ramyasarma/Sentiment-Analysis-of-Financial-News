Japanese  stocks  rose for the first
time in three days as companies announced alliances and amid
speculation China’s interest-rate increase will not drag down
share prices.  Elpida Memory Inc. , the world’s third-largest maker of
computer-memory chips, advanced 1.6 percent after a report said
it is in talks with Taiwanese semiconductor companies on a
business tie-up. Canon Inc. and Hitachi Ltd. climbed at least
0.7 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said Taiwan’s Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co. plans to acquire control of their liquid-
crystal display venture. Fanuc Corp., Japan’s largest maker of
industrial robots, gained 1.5 percent.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.8 percent to 10,355.99
at the close in Tokyo. The broader  Topix  index gained 0.3
percent to 904.68 with about four stocks advancing for every
three that fell. The total value of stocks traded on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange’s first section was 832 billion yen ($10 billion),
the lowest level since Jan. 4.  “There’s selective buying on company news,” said  Koichi Kurose , chief strategist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., which
manages about $57 billion. “The business environment for
manufacturers, especially semiconductor-related makers, is
gradually getting better. China’s interest-rate increase had
been expected, I don’t see an impact on the market.”  The Topix has declined 0.3 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 13 percent by the  S&P 500  and 11 percent by the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
15.7 times estimated earnings, compared with 14.7 times for the
S&P and 12.5 times for the Stoxx.  Elpida Climbs  Elpida Memory advanced 1.6 percent to 942 yen. Kyodo News
said the company is in talks with Taiwan semiconductor companies
including Powerchip Technology Corp. for mergers and tie-ups.  Hitachi climbed 0.7 percent and Canon rose 0.9 percent
after the Nikkei newspaper said Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.
of Taiwan plans to acquire control of a liquid-crystal display
venture between Hitachi and Canon for 100 billion yen.  In China, the  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the
bigger of the country’s stock exchanges, climbed as much as 1.5
percent to 2,876.811 in early trading on speculation a second
interest-rate increase since mid-October will curb inflation.
Chinese shares fell after Japan’s market closed.  Fanuc, which gets more than 50 percent of its revenue from
Asian countries outside Japan, gained 1.5 percent to 12,500 yen.
 TDK Corp. , an electronics maker that counts China as its largest
market, increased 1.8 percent to 5,730 yen. Hitachi Construction
Machinery Co., the world’s biggest maker of large excavators,
rose 1.6 percent to 1,958 yen. Komatsu Ltd., a maker of earth
movers that gets about 20 percent of its sales in China, rose
0.7 percent to 2,486 yen.  China’s Interest Rate  “There was no surprise in China’s interest rate
increase,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450
million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
“Funds are likely to flow into Japan from emerging markets” on
the outlook for further monetary tightening.  China’s benchmark one-year lending rate was raised by 25
basis points to 5.81 percent. The one-year deposit rate climbed
by the same amount to 2.75 percent the People’s Bank of China
said in a one-sentence statement on its website on Dec. 25. The
change became effective yesterday.  “There’s a sense of hope that China will not do things
that slow the nation’s economy while it raises interest rates,”
said  Ikuo Mitsui , who helps manage $270 million at Vivace
Capital Management Co.  Dai Nippon Printing Co. , a provider of printing services,
rallied 1.8 percent to 1,122 yen. The company will triple
production of film used for lithium-ion batteries and solar
cells, the Nikkei newspaper reported, without saying where it
got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
