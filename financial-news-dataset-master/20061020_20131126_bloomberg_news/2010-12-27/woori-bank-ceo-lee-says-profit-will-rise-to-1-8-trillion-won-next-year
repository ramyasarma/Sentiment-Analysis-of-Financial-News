Woori Bank, a unit of Woori Finance
Holdings Co., aims for a net profit of 1.8 trillion won ($1.6
billion) next year, rising from an estimate of about 1.2
trillion won for this year, as the company projects lower bad-
loan provisions in 2011, according to the lender’s chief
executive officer Lee Chong Hwi. Woori Bank spokesman Jung Hee
Kyung confirmed the CEO’s remarks, which were earlier reported
by Yonhap News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
