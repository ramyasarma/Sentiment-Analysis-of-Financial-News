Oil traded near its highest price in
more than two years in New York as temperatures fell and storms
blanketed snow across the eastern U.S., increasing demand for
heating fuel.  New York City may get as much as 20 inches (51 centimeters)
of snow by tonight with temperatures dropping as low as 22
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6 Celsius), according to weather
forecaster AccuWeather. The People’s Bank of China boosted
benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates on Dec. 25 for the
second time since October.  “Currently it seems the focus is on cold weather in Europe
and the northeast U.S,” said  Thorbjoern Bak Jensen , an analyst
at Global Risk Management in Middelfart, Denmark. “The Chinese
rate hike had some effect.”  Crude for February delivery traded at $91.49 a barrel, down
2 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 9:10 a.m. London time. The contract earlier rose as
much as 37 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $91.88 a barrel, the
highest price since Oct. 7, 2008. Brent crude for February
settlement was up 34 cents at $94.11 a barrel on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange London after rising as high as $94.52.  Futures in New York climbed 4 percent last week. Floor
trading was closed Dec. 24 for the Christmas holiday.  Heating oil rose as much as 0.9 cent to $2.5498 a gallon in
New York, the fifth straight daily increase. Most U.S. heating
oil is consumed in the northeast.  Bad Weather  Oil, which rallied 78 percent in 2009, has gained 16
percent this year as the global economic recovery bolstered
demand, reducing supplies held in storage.  “Crude oil came under pressure due to what happened in
China but the bad weather on the east coast is causing traders
to think demand will increase,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing
director of Commodity Broking Services in Sydney.  Crude inventories  in the U.S. dropped 5.33 million barrels
to 340.7 million even as imports increased, the Energy
Department said Dec. 22 in its weekly report. Stockpiles have
decreased so far this month by 19 million barrels, or 5.3
percent, the most since December 2006.  “Despite the two or three draws we have had, inventories
are still above average,” said  Tobias Merath , head of
commodities at Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. “When we move
into mid-January and early February, the risk is that oil prices
could fall again, not by a lot, but into the 80s.”  Sixteen of 30 analysts and traders, or 53 percent, forecast
oil prices will rise this week as supplies decline further, the
Bloomberg News survey showed. Eight respondents, or 27 percent,
predicted crude will fall and six estimated there will be little
change. Last week, 53 percent of survey respondents said the
market would drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
