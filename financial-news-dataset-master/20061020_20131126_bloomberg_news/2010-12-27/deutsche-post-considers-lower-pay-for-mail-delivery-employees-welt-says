Deutsche Post AG  is aiming to cut
wages for workers in its mail-delivery unit,  Die Welt  newspaper
reported today, citing Juergen Gerdes, a member of the company’s
management board.  Wages at the Bonn-based company must fall as mail-delivery
volumes are shrinking by as much as 3 percent per year, Gerdes
told the newspaper in an interview, adding that negotiations
over pay cuts with Germany’s Ver.di labor union will resume in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
