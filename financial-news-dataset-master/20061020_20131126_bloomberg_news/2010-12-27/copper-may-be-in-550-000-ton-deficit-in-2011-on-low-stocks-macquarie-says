The global copper market is
estimated to have a 550,000-metric ton deficit next year as
falling stockpiles push prices to $5 a pound, Macquarie Bank
Ltd. said in a research report today.  The forecast was based on an assumption of 4 percent mine
supply disruption, or 720,000 tons, with global stocks falling
to below three weeks of world consumption, according to the
report. It also excluded material that may be held by exchange-
traded products launched by BlackRock Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &
Co., it said.  The final 2011 copper deficit could be bigger as the bank
believes the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the
introduction of the ETF products, said Macquarie.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Richard Dobson, Matthew Oakley.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
