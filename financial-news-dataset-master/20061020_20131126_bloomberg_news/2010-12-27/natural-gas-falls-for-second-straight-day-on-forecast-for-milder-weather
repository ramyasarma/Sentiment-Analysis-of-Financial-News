Natural gas futures declined for a
second day on forecasts for milder weather next week, reducing
demand for the heating fuel.  Natural gas dropped below $4 as temperatures in the U.S.
Northeast will be about 5 degrees Fahrenheit higher than average
from Jan. 1 to Jan. 5, according to the National Weather
Service. About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  “It’s a weather-driven market, and we are seeing some
warmer-than-normal weather next week and fewer heating degree
days,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics, an
energy research firm in London, Arkansas. “The market can be
more volatile at this time of the year because it’s thinly
traded.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 8.2 cents, or 2
percent, to $4.001 per million British thermal units at 12:23
p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures have
declined 4.3 percent this month and 28 percent this year.  The January contract expires tomorrow. The February
contract declined 7.9 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $4.054. January
options expire today.  January $4 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading. The puts dropped 0.9 cent to 2 cents per million Btu on
volume of 548 lots.  The Nymex delayed the open of floor trading until 11 a.m.,
two hours later than usual, because of a snowstorm in New York,
according to  Brenda Guzman , a spokeswoman for the exchange.  Reduced Trading  Gas trading volume was 144,658 on Dec. 23, down 49 percent
from the three-month average of 283,000.  New York will have a high of 46 degrees Fahrenheit (8
degrees Celsius) on Jan. 1, 7 degrees above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania. Boston will
have a high of 43 degrees, 5 degrees above normal.  Heating demand in the U.S. may be 8 percent below normal
from Dec. 28 through Jan. 3, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri.  “Looks like the weather is going to be pretty warm next
week and gas storage is still above the five-year average,”
said  Carl Neill , an energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in
Atlanta. “You need more cold weather to get gas going up
again.”  The East Coast faces a second day of travel disruption
after snowstorms blanketed cities from New York to Boston. New
York City’s Central Park had 20 inches (51 centimeters) of snow,
the most in 10 months, by 8 a.m., the National Weather Service
said.  New York will stop snowing tomorrow and the weather will
turn to sunny on Dec. 29, according to the  weather service .  U.S. gas inventories declined by 184 billion cubic feet in
the week ended Dec. 17 to 3.368 trillion cubic feet, the Energy
Department reported last week. Stockpiles were 8.5 percent above
the five-year average for that time of year.  The number of natural-gas rigs fell 10 to 931 last week in
the U.S., according to Baker Hughes Inc. The rig count was 24
percent higher than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
