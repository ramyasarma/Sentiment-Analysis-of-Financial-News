The Federal Aviation Administration
said the time of reopening John F. Kennedy International Airport
and LaGuardia Airport in New York, and New Jersey’s Newark
Liberty airport is currently not known. Earlier today the
authority said on its website that the airports were scheduled
to open today after snowstorms blanketed the East Coast with
snow and wind and airlines canceled flights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
