Addax Petroleum Corp. ’s crude output
has risen 14 percent since the Geneva-based company was acquired
by  China Petrochemical Corp.  in August last year as oil and gas
reserves increased.  Crude production at Addax has grown to 155,000 barrels a
day from 136,000 barrels a day, China Petrochemical, known as
Sinopec Group, said in a  statement  on its website. Addax may
have added 110 million barrels of oil and gas reserves this
year, according to the statement.  Sinopec Group bought Addax for C$8.3 billion ($8.2 billion)
to gain oil reserves in Iraq’s Kurdistan and West Africa. The
Beijing-based company said this month the group’s overseas crude
output may surge 40 percent to 18 million metric tons this year.  Addax’s crude production may rise to 7 million tons this
year from 6.75 million tons in 2009, according to Sinopec Group.
Oil and gas output may reach 20 million tons of oil equivalent
by 2015, the Chinese company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
