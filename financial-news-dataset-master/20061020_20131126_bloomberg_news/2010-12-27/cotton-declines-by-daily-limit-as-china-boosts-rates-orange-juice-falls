Cotton tumbled for the third
straight session after China raised interest rates, signaling
commodity demand may ease. Orange juice jumped the most in two
weeks on concern that a frost in Florida may hurt citrus crops.  The People’s Bank of China boosted one-year lending and
deposit rates by 25 basis points on Dec. 25 to counter
accelerating inflation. Cotton futures dropped 8.4 percent in
three sessions. On Dec. 21, the price reached a record $1.5912 a
pound.  “China trying to control inflation is adding further
pressure,” said  Sharon Johnson , a senior analyst at Penson
Futures in Atlanta.  Cotton for March delivery slumped 2.36 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $1.4576 at 2:37 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Earlier, the price fell 6 cents, the exchange
limit. U.S. markets were closed on Dec. 24.  Prices have surged 93 percent this year as global supplies
trailed demand from China, the world’s biggest user.  China imported 126,125 metric tons last month, according to
the country’s customs agency. That compares with 154,547 tons a
year earlier and 96,096 in October.  Prices also fell on speculation that a merchant may have
had to liquidate part of its position because of “cash
problems,” Johnson said. Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which
owns ICE Futures, declined to comment.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery jumped 4.75 cents,
or 2.9 percent, to $1.687 a pound, the seventh straight gain.
The increase was the biggest in two weeks.  “There is a hard-freeze warning from tonight through
tomorrow morning in most parts of Florida,” said Anthony
Chipriano, a meteorologist at MDA Information Systems Inc. in
Rockville, Maryland. Temperatures might fall to as low as 21
degree Fahrenheit (minus 6 degree Celsius) in some areas, he
said.  The commodity has gained 31 percent this year. Brazil is
the biggest orange grower, followed by Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
