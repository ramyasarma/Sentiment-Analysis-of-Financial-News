New Jersey Transit said Northeast
Corridor service is operating to and from Newark Penn Station
only with delays of 60 minutes to 90 minutes in both directions
because of signal problems near New York. The agency, which
commented in an e-mailed statement, earlier reported that
service between Newark and New York was suspended.  Amtrak earlier also suspended service between Newark and
New York’s Penn Station.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
