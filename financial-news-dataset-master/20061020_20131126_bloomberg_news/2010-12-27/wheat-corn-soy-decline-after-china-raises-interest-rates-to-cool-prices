Soybeans rose for a sixth day,
reversing an earlier loss, as dry weather in South America,
threatens to curb harvests amid signs of increasing demand in
China. Corn and wheat declined.  March-delivery soybeans advanced as much as 0.5 percent to
$13.67 a bushel, the highest price since Aug. 27, 2008. The
contract traded at $13.65 a bushel at 2:15 p.m. Manila time.  Nineteen of 25 traders and analysts surveyed in the U.S. on
Dec. 23 forecast that soybeans will advance for a third straight
week on speculation that hot, dry weather will damage crops in
Brazil and Argentina, the biggest exporters after the U.S.  “We saw the bullish momentum in the market last week, and
I expect that to continue because of tightening global supply,”
Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte in Singapore
said by phone today.  China, the world’s biggest soybean importer, will auction
300,000 metric tons of the oilseed and 1.8 million tons of corn
from reserves tomorrow, the National Grain & Oil Trade Center
said on its website. The country is the world’s largest corn
user after the U.S.  The Asian nation may draw down state inventories to slow
inflation, prompting the government to increase imports to boost
domestic supply, Ker said. China’s  inflation  rate was 5.1
percent in November, the highest level in 28 months.  ‘Severe’ Dryness  Argentina may have “severe” dryness and temperatures of
more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the 16 days from yesterday,
Chicago-based QT Weather said in a Dec. 26 e-mailed report.
Argentina is the world’s third-largest soybean exporter,
according to the USDA.  “The driest weather of the growing season has just begun
in Argentina,” according to the QT Weather report.  The Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange cut its estimate for this
year’s planted soybean crop by 200,000 hectares to 18.5 million
hectares because of dry conditions, it said in a Dec. 23
statement.  U.S.  exporters  sold 827,810 tons of soybeans in the week
ended Dec. 16, more than nine times the total a week earlier,
the Department of Agriculture said Dec. 23. China purchased 77
percent of last week’s total shipments from the U.S.  Sales  for
delivery in the marketing year that began Sept. 1 are 12 percent
higher than a year earlier, according to the data.  March-delivery wheat declined as much as 2.2 percent to
$7.66 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, before trading at
$7.815. Corn for March delivery slipped 0.2 percent to $6.1275 a
bushel.  Rising inflation in China may push the Asian nation to
boost corn imports to 3.5 million tons, more than triple the
USDA 1 million ton  estimate  on Dec. 10, Ker said.  ---With assistance from Jae Hur in Tokyo, Jeff Wilson in
