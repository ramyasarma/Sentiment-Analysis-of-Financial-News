England built a 128-run lead over
Australia on day two of the fourth Ashes Test at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground, reaching 226-2 at lunch after losing both
opening batsmen.   Resuming at 157-0 in reply to Australia’s record-low 98,
 Alastair Cook  and  Andrew Strauss  added two runs before Cook, on
82, edged a  Peter Siddle  delivery to  Shane Watson . Siddle then
had Strauss caught by Mike Hussey for 69 to make it 170-2.  Jonathan Trott  and  Kevin Pietersen  shared an unbeaten 56-
run stand to take England, which would retain the Ashes with a
victory at the MCG, to the interval with eight first-innings
wickets in hand. Trott is 31 not out, with Pietersen on 30.  James Anderson and Chris Tremlett each took four wickets
yesterday as Australia slumped to its lowest first-innings total
in 133 years of elite Tests at the MCG after England captain
Strauss won the toss and chose to bowl first.  Not since 1907 has any team scoring under 100 in the first
innings of a Test fought back to win.  The best-of-five contest is tied at 1-1 following
Australia’s 267-run win in Perth. As holder of the Ashes,
England would keep the trophy by tying the series. The English
last successfully retained the Ashes in 1986-87, when  Mike Gatting ’s team secured a 2-1 win in Australia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
