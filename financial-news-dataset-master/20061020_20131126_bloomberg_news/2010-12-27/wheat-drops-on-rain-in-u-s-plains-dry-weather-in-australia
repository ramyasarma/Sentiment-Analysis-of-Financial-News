Wheat futures fell for a second day
on speculation that rain and snow in the U.S. Great Plains this
week will improve prospects for winter crops, while dry weather
in Australia may speed up the harvest.  The U.S. Plains may get 0.3 inch (0.8 centimeter) of
precipitation this week, improving soil moisture, and snow may
provide protective cover to plants in dormancy, according to a
report from World Weather Inc. Australia, which had record
rainfall for the September-to-November period, may be dry until
the weekend, when “light” rain will have limited impact on the
harvest, according to the report.  “The Plains do have two separate chances for rain lined up
this week, with Wednesday to Thursday and Friday to Saturday
systems,” said  Rich Nelson , the director of research at
Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois. Australia is “expected to
be dry for the next seven to 10 days, which may help the harvest
to retake some ground.”  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 3.75 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $7.7925 a bushel at 10:21 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Before today, prices climbed 13 percent this month on
adverse weather concerns.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
