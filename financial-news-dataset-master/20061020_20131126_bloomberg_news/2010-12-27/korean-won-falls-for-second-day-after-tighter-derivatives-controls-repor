The South Korean won declined for a
second day after the the Korea Economic Daily reported that
regulators will tighten controls on currency derivatives.  The won weakened 0.12 percent to 1152.13 per dollar at 9:10
a.m. in Seoul. Regulators will limit currency derivatives
holdings at domestic banks to 40 percent of equity capital from
50 percent, the paper reported, citing unidentified officials at
the finance ministry and the Bank of Korea. The cap on local
branches of foreign banks will be reduced to 200 percent from
250 percent. The government will likely implement the changes in
March, according to the report.  South Korea’s Ministry of Strategy and Finance said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday that it is undecided about changes
in the rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
