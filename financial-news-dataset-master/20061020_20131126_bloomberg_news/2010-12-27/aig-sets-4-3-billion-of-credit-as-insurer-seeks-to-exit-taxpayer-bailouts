American International Group Inc.
signed $4.3 billion of credit agreements as the insurer, rescued
from collapse by the U.S. in 2008, seeks independence from the
government.    The accords, administered by JPMorgan Chase & Co., include
a three-year deal for $1.5 billion and a similar amount for 364
days, New York-based AIG said in a regulatory filing today.
Chartis Inc., an AIG subsidary, obtained an additional $1.3
billion, according to the filing.  The agreements are contingent upon the insurer paying down
its credit line with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by
March 31, the filing showed.   AIG, which is seeking to replace government funds with
private capital, said on Dec. 8 that it had struck a deal to
repay a $20 billion credit line from the Fed, the regulator that
helped bail out the insurer during the financial crisis, then
focus on its obligations to the U.S. Treasury Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
