Japan’s unemployment rate remained
unchanged in November, suggesting that concern about the job
market may limit consumer spending as stimulus programs expire.  The  jobless rate  held at 5.1 percent, the statistics bureau
said today in Tokyo, matching the median estimate of 29
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  JVC Kenwood Holdings Inc. , a Japanese maker of audio
equipment, video cameras and televisions, said last week it’s
cutting 500 positions because sales have been hurt by the strong
yen and competition with Asian manufacturers. Those job losses
may continue as an economic slowdown convinces employers to shed
workers, risking a slump in consumer sentiment.  “There’s still a lot of excess labor at companies, and
that’s making it difficult for employers to hire new staff,”
 Yonosuke Iwata , an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute
in Tokyo, said before the report.  Japan’s currency has gained more than 10 percent against
the dollar this year, threatening to reduce exporters’ profits
and make their products more expensive in markets abroad.  In September, the government ended a car subsidy program
that was introduced to power the economic recovery. Japan has
started to phase out another stimulus measure that provides
consumers with incentives to buy energy-efficient vehicles. The
program is scheduled to expire in March.  A separate report today showed that the  job-to-applicant
ratio  rose to 0.57, meaning there are 57 jobs for every 100
candidates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
