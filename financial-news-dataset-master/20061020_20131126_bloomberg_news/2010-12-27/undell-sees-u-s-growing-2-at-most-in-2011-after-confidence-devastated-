The U.S. economy will probably grow
no more than 2 percent in 2011, less than what’s needed to lower
unemployment, Nobel-prize winning economist  Robert Mundell  said.  “I don’t see economic growth as being any better than 2
percent,” the Columbia University economics professor said in
an interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smarts”
with  Carol Massar . “You had this financial shock to the economy
which devastated confidence, and there is nothing around the
corner that looks like it’s going to be a strong push for the
economy.”  The economy grew at an average 2.9 percent annual rate in
the five quarters since the worst recession in seven decades
ended in June 2009. That pace of recovery has lowered
 unemployment  from a peak of 10.1 percent in October 2009 to 9.8
percent last month.  Mundell, 78, said the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy
actions, known as quantitative easing, had the undesired effect
of strengthening the dollar.  “ The Fed  policy was working three or four times before,
but then it was cut off because the dollar soared and that’s
what really broke the back of the economy,” he said. The Fed
has been “negligent” in not taking into account the influence
a rising dollar would have on the economy, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
