Colombia’s peso fell the most in 14
months on speculation higher interest rates in China will erode
demand for the South American nation’s commodity exports and as
dollar purchases by the central bank cut into local banks’
holdings of the U.S. currency.  The peso slid 2.1 percent, leading declines today among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Banco de la Republica began on Sept. 15 buying a minimum of
$20 million a day through auctions that it said will last until
at least March 15. Those purchases and growing corporate demand
for dollars are drying up the supply, Banco de Bogota SA said in
a report today.  “We’ll likely see slower growth globally and therefore
reduced demand for exports as other countries follow in China’s
footsteps and raise interest rates,” said Omar Escorcia, an
analyst at Medellin-based brokerage Asesores en Valores SA. Low
trading volume is also boosting volatility in the currency
market, he said.  The peso weakened to 1,980.50 per U.S. dollar at 2:18 p.m.
New York time from 1,939.20 on Dec. 24. That’s its biggest
plunge since Oct. 20, 2009. It is down 7.9 percent in the past
three months, the worst performance among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  While pressure for the peso to weaken will likely continue
through year-end, the dollar’s “attractive” levels as well as
an expected increase in foreign inflows at the beginning of 2011
will help stem declines, Banco de Bogota, the country’s second-
biggest bank, said in the report.  Chinese Rate  The People’s Bank of China increased key one-year lending
and deposit rates by 25 basis points to 5.81 percent on Dec. 25
in a bid to keep a lid on inflation. China’s monetary tightening
in 2011 may be mainly in the first half as officials tackle the
fastest inflation in more than two years, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and Morgan Stanley said.  Oil accounts for about 40 percent of Colombia’s total
exports and coal accounts for about 15 percent. In the first ten
months of the year, Colombia sent 6 percent of its exports to
China, its second-biggest trading partner after the U.S,. which
accounted for 42 percent of the South American nation’s sales
abroad.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent peso bonds due
2020 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.75
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price dropped 0.354 centavo to 121.310 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
