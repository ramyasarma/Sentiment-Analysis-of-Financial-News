Singapore will extend its offer of
vision-correcting surgery to more regulars in its armed forces
next year, aiming to improve the way they shoot, swim or pilot
planes, the Straits Times said.  Singapore Armed Forces has doubled the number of candidates
available for critical jobs such as pilots, commandos and navy
divers over the past five years by paying for the S$2,000
photorefractive keratectomy surgery for shortsighted personnel,
the newspaper reported today.   Myopia, or shortsightedness, affects 8 in 10 young men who
enter the city-state’s national service and half of the 20,000
regulars in the armed forces, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
