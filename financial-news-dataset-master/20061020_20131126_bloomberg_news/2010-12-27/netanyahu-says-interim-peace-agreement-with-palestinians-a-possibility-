Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said an interim peace deal with the Palestinians is
possible even without agreement on such issues as the status of
Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.  If Israel and the Palestinians didn’t reach agreement on
some of the so-called final status issues, “the result could be
an interim agreement; that is certainly a possibility,”
Netanyahu said in an interview broadcast today on Israel’s
Channel 10 television.  Israeli Foreign Minister  Avigdor Lieberman  said yesterday a
peace agreement with the Palestinians under current conditions
isn’t possible and any attempts to reach a deal in the coming
year are “unrealistic.”  The prime minister’s office later released a statement
saying Lieberman’s remarks represented his personal views and
not the policies of the government. Lieberman’s Yisrael Beitenu
party is the second-biggest faction in Netanyahu’s Likud-led
coalition.  The Obama administration is trying to broker a peace deal
between Israel and the Palestinians by using U.S. Middle East
envoy  George Mitchell  as a mediator. A previous effort using
direct talks between the sides broke down in September.  State Department spokesman  Mark Toner  today said the U.S.
continues “to work to bring both parties back into
negotiations.”  “Our position is clear: We remain hard at work with the
parties to achieve a framework agreement on all the core
issues,” he said.  -- With assistance from  Indira Lakshmanan  in Washington.
