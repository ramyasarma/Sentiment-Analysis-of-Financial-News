What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade as dry weather threatens yields in
Argentina, said  Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. Soybean-meal futures
may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to open up 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago on speculation that U.S. farmers will increase
sales after the start next week of the new tax year, Grow said.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as drier weather firms muddy fields in Australia
for harvesting that was delayed by rain in the past month, Grow
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
