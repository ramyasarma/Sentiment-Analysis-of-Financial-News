Treasury two-year notes remained
lower after the government auctioned $35 billion of the
securities in the first of three note offerings this week
totaling $99 billion.  The notes drew a yield of 0.740 percent, compared with an
average forecast of 0.761 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
7 of the Federal Reserve’s 18 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the
amount of securities offered, was 3.71, compared with 3.70 at
the Nov. 22 sale and an average of 3.31 for the previous 10
auctions.  “Twos have sold off, which have made them more attractive
yield-wise,” said  James Combias , head of Treasury trading at
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New York, before the auction.
“These three days are all about supply. Nothing else. The
market is going to have to build in concessions to take down the
rest of the supply.” As a primary dealer, the firm is obligated
to participate in U.S. debt offerings.  The  yield  on the current two-year note gained five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 0.71 percent, at 1:05 p.m.
in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The  yield  on the
benchmark 10-year  note  advanced one basis point to 3.40 percent.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 22.6 percent of the notes, compared
with 38.3 percent last month and an average of 37.6 percent for
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.8 percent of
the notes, versus the 10-sale average of 14.7 percent.  Two-year notes have returned 2.1 percent this year,
compared with a 5.3 percent gain for the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Treasury will sell $35 billion in five-year debt
tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year notes on Dec. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
