Dubai shares fell to the lowest in
more than three months, led by Emirates NBD PJSC, as the United
Arab Emirates central bank asked lenders to increase provisions
against money owed by Saudi Arabia’s Algosaibi and Saad groups.  Emirates NBD , the country’s biggest bank, slid the most
since February and  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC  lost for a second
day. Dubai’s  DFM General Index  retreated 1 percent to 1,603.42,
the lowest since Sept. 7, at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate.
The measure has lost 11 percent this year and is headed for its
worst annual performance since 2008. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index 
of companies in the region dropped 0.3 percent.  “The interesting topic today is the increase in provisions
to 80 percent for Saad debt. This impacts all the banks
negatively,” said  Ahmed Talhaoui , Abu Dhabi-based head of
investment at Royal Capital. “It is almost a total write-off.”  The U.A.E. central bank asked financial institutions to
raise provisions to 80 percent by year-end toward Saudi Arabia’s
Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi & Brothers Co. and Saad Group, the
regulator said in a circular dated Dec. 25. The central bank had
previously asked banks to set aside 50 percent of the value of
their loans to cover losses.  The  DFM Financial Banks Index  fell 1.8 percent, the most
since June 29. Abu Dhabi’s  benchmark index  declined 0.4 percent.  $15.7 Billion  Saudi Arabia’s Saad and Algosaibi groups defaulted on at
least $15.7 billion of loans last year. The two Saudi family
groups have borrowed from more than 80 regional and
international banks, including Paris-based BNP Paribas SA, New
York-based Citigroup Inc. and Arab Bank Plc in Amman, Jordan,
according to documents provided by lenders.  Emirates NBD fell 4.8 percent, the most since Feb. 23, to
2.75 dirhams. The bank said in October it set aside money in the
third quarter to cover 70 percent of its exposure to the
troubled Saudi groups. Dubai Islamic, the largest Shariah
compliant lender in the country, lost 0.5 percent 2.15 dirhams.  In the neighboring emirate,  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC 
slid 1.4 percent to 2.05 dirhams, the lowest since Sept. 15. The
third-largest bank in the U.A.E. by assets is owed a combined
2.24 billion dirhams ($610 million) by the Saad and Algosaibi
groups, according to a prospectus for the bank’s global medium-
term notes last year.  Qatar’s  gauge  lost 0.2 percent and Bahrain’s  measure 
decreased 0.1 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index 
dropped 0.5 percent, while Kuwait’s  SE Price Index  rose 0.2
percent. Oman’s market was closed for a holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
