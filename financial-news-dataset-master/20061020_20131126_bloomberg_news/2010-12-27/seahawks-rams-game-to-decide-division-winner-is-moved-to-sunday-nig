The St. Louis Rams will visit the
Seattle Seahawks in the final Sunday night game of the National
Football League regular season, a matchup that will decide the
division winner.  The Jan. 2 game was moved to an 8:20 p.m. New York time
start as part of the NFL’s flexible scheduling policy, which
ensures quality matchups for “Sunday Night Football” on
 General Electric Co. ’s NBC.  The winner will make the playoffs as the National Football
Conference’s West Division champion. The first-place Rams have a
7-8 record, while the Seahawks are 6-9 and could become the
first team to reach the postseason with a losing record since
the NFL expanded to a 16-game season in 1977.  Five other Week 17 games with playoff implications have
been rescheduled to start at 4:15 p.m. New York time on Jan. 2.  The Green Bay Packers can clinch a playoff berth when they
host the Chicago Bears, while Jacksonville visits Houston and
Indianapolis hosts Tennessee in games that will determine the
winner of the American Football Conference South Division. The
Philadelphia Eagles, who are already assured of a postseason
berth, host Dallas and the New York Giants visit Washington
needing to win to keep their playoff chances alive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
