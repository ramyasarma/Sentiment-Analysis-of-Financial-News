NEC Corp. , Japan’s largest maker of
personal computers, plans to increase fivefold its capacity to
produce electrodes for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries to
meet demand for environmentally friendly technologies.  NEC will use a Japanese government subsidy to boost the
production capacity at its plant in Sagamihara, west of Tokyo,
to 10 million kilowatt-hours by the end of 2012 from more than 2
million kilowatt-hours in the year to March 31, 2011, the Tokyo-
based company said on its  website  today.  Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will
provide 110 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in subsidies to fund 153
projects of companies including Toyota Motor Corp. and Hitachi
Ltd. as part of a plan to create jobs that help reduce
emissions, according to a statement today on its  website .  NEC  fell 0.4 percent to 246 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in Tokyo. The shares have gained 2.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
