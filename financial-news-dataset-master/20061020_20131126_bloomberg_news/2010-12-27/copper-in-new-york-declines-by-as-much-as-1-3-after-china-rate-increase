Copper in New York dropped as much

inflation.  The People’s Bank of China increased key one-year lending
and deposit rates by 25 basis points on Christmas Day. The
change took effect yesterday.  The March-delivery contract traded 0.8 pecent lower at
$4.2255 a pound by 8:28 a.m. in Shanghai.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
