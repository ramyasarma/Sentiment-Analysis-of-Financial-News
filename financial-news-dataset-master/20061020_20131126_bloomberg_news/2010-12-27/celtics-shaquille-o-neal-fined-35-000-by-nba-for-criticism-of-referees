Boston Celtics center  Shaquille O’Neal  was fined $35,000 by the National Basketball Association
for criticizing referees.  The league issued the fine today, NBA Executive Vice
President  Stu Jackson  said in a news release.  O’Neal made the comments after scoring two points and
fouling out in the fourth quarter of the Celtics’ 86-78 loss to
the Orlando Magic on Dec. 25. In a post-game interview, O’Neal
criticized the game’s officiating and singled out veteran
referee  Bob Delaney .  O’Neal, a 15-time All-Star and three-time NBA Finals Most
Valuable Player, has averaged 23.9 points and 11 rebounds per
game over his 19-year career. He is seventh on the all-time
scoring list and first among active players, with 28,460 points.  In 2008 when he was a member of the Phoenix Suns, O’Neal
was fined $25,000 by the league for verbal abuse of an official.
He was fined $5,000 this season for criticism of referees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
