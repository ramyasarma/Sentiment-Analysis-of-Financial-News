U.S.  home prices  will fall 5 percent
to 7 percent more before a reaching a bottom in late 2011, said
 Stan Humphries , chief economist of  Zillow Inc. , a provider of
housing data.  The backlog of homes in foreclosure is swelling the
inventory of properties for sale, making buyers hesitant to
enter the market, Humphries said in an interview today on
Bloomberg Television. The inventory will be boosted further by
properties that have yet to be foreclosed on, he said.  “Supply is just overwhelming,” Humphries said. “We are
tripping over houses in this country right now.”  The S&P/Case-Shiller index and the National Association of
Realtors show that U.S. home prices found a floor last year.
Home prices in 20 U.S. cities  fell  almost 32 percent from their
2006 peak before reaching a low in May 2009, according to the
S&P/Case-Shiller index.  Buyers are wary of making home purchases because they fear
that prices will fall further, Humphries said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
