The market for solar power equipment
will consolidate as only those companies that can reduce their
operating costs will survive, Handelsblatt reported, citing
Sunpower Corp. Chief Executive Officer Tom Werner.  Companies that cover all steps in the production of solar
panels can cut expenses more than those specializing on
individual components as market conditions become tougher over
the next five years, the German newspaper said, citing an
interview with the CEO.  Sunpower aims to halve its production costs in the next
five years and will take a decision on building a plant in 2011,
Handelsblatt cited Werner as saying. The company will probably
locate the facility in Asia, as wages in the region are lower
than in other markets, the newspaper reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
