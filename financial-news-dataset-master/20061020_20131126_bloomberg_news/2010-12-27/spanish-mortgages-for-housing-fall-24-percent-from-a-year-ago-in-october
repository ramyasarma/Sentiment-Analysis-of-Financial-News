The number of mortgages issued for
Spanish homes in October dropped the most since April 2009 as
the expiry of a tax incentive at year-end approached.  The number of home mortgages fell 24 percent from a year
earlier, the National Statistics Institute said in a statement
today. Mortgage  lending  in terms of capital loaned declined 33
percent from a year earlier, the most since October 2009, it
said.  The drop in mortgages coincides with a slide in home sales,
which fell 17.7 percent from a year earlier in October to the
lowest level on record. Homes sales had increased through the
first eight months of the year ahead of a year-end deadline to
lock in a tax rebate, valued at as much as 1,352 euros ($1,779)
a year.  Total housing permits fell 34 percent in October from a
year ago, the Development Ministry said in a separate statement
today.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
