Copper in Shanghai and New York
gained, reversing earlier falls after China raised interest
rates for the second time since mid-October to cool inflation.  Metal for March delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
advanced as much as 0.5 percent to 69,270 yuan a metric ton
after dipping by 0.9 percent. Copper for delivery in the same
month on the Comex in New York also climbed 0.5 percent to
$4.2780 a pound after slipping 1.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
