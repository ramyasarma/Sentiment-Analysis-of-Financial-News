A Bank of Japan board member said
there’s uncertainty about the U.S. Federal Reserve’s
quantitative easing policy, minutes from the bank’s policy-
setting meeting showed.  One “member was of the view that the effects of the
measure taken” by the Fed “were highly uncertain and growth in
the U.S. economy was still likely to remain low for some time,”
minutes from a Nov. 4-5 meeting released by the BOJ in Tokyo
today said.  The BOJ board meeting was held after the Fed announced it
would buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries to support
the world’s biggest economy. Regarding Japan’s expansion, BOJ
members said they needed to continue to monitor the effect of
the yen’s advance on exporters, with one person noting  gross
domestic product  could contract this quarter.  “Many members said that careful attention should continue
to be paid to the possibility that the appreciation of the yen
might exert downward pressure on Japan’s economy by negatively
affecting business and household sentiment,” the minutes said.
“A few members expressed the opinion that careful attention
should be paid to the economy’s vulnerability to downside risks,
particularly when the pace of economic improvement remained
slow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
