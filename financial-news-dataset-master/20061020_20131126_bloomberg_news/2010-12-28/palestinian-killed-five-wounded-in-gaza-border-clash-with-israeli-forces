 One Palestinian was killed and five
others wounded in a clash at the Gaza Strip border fence,
according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.  Israeli soldiers spotted a group of Palestinians planting
explosives by the fence and opened fire from ground and air
forces, an Israeli army spokeswoman said, speaking anonymously
according to military regulation. At least one Palestinian was
hit directly, the army said.  One Palestinian belonging to a militant group was killed,
and five other civilians in the area were injured by Israeli
fire, two of them seriously, Gaza medical official Adham Abu
Selmeya told journalists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
