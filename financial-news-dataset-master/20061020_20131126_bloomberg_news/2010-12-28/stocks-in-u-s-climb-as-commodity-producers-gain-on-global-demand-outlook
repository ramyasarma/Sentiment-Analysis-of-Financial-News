U.S. stocks advanced, extending the
biggest December rally since 1991 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index, as commodity producers gained on higher prices for energy
and metals amid signs of growing global demand.  Chevron Corp.  and Newmont Mining Corp. paced gains that
sent producers of energy and raw materials to the biggest
increase among 10 groups in the S&P 500. General Motors Co.
rallied 2.1 percent after analysts at banks including JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley advised buying the  shares .  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  increased 0.1 percent to
1,258.51 as of 4 p.m. in New York after drifting between gains
and losses earlier. The index is up 6.6 percent this month. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 20.51 points, or 0.2
percent, to 11,575.54, its highest level since Aug. 28, 2008.
Treasuries slid, sending the 10-year yield up 15 basis points to
3.48 percent for its biggest gain in two weeks, after demand
weakened at a U.S. debt auction.  “Portfolio managers are playing a bit of a game of not
wanting to be so light stocks and heavy bonds at the end of the
year,” said  James Paulsen , chief investment strategist at
Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, which oversees about
$340 billion. “The 12/31 print of net results are going to be
that stocks beat bonds so they’re buying stocks and selling
bonds.”  The  S&P 500  has rallied 13 percent in 2010, rising above
its close of 1,251.70 on Sept. 12, 2008, the last trading
session before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed the world’s
biggest bankruptcy and prompted a 46 percent drop for the stock
index through March 2009.  Quantitative Easing  The measure has advanced 20 percent since Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke   suggested  on Aug. 27 that he was
prepared to purchase bonds to spur economic growth, a second
round of quantitative easing that the central bank eventually
announced in November. The benchmark index for U.S. equities has
risen 14 of the past 17 weeks, which last happened in 1972,
according to  Howard Silverblatt , S&P’s New York-based senior
index analyst.  Benchmark indexes fluctuated earlier in the day as reports
on retail sales, consumer confidence and home prices presented a
mixed picture of the outlook for the world’s largest economy.  U.S. retail sales, excluding autos, rose 5.5 percent to
$584 billion from Nov. 5 through Dec. 24 for the biggest
holiday-season increase since 2005, according to MasterCard
Advisors’ SpendingPulse, which measures sales by all payment
forms. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index
decreased to 52.5, lower than the most pessimistic forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and down from a revised
54.3 in November.  Commodity Producers Lead  About 468 million shares changed hands on the NYSE
yesterday, the fewest for a full-day session since May 1998, as
trading slowed following a snowstorm. New York commuters and
travelers faced further disruptions today as winds hindered
efforts to clear roads and runways following the heaviest
December snows in six decades, and about 560 million shares were
traded in the session.  The S&P 500 moved in a 0.29 percentage-point range between
today’s high and low, the narrowest swing since November 2006
and less than half the 0.72 average over the past four weeks.  Energy and raw-materials companies led gains among 10
groups in the S&P 500, while consumer shares had the biggest
decline.  Chevron Rises  Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company, rose 1.2
percent to $91.19. Oil traded near a 26-month high after crude
supplies were forecast to extend their biggest monthly decline
since December 2006 as demand picks up. Newmont Mining, the
largest U.S. gold producer, gained 2.4 percent to $61.55 as the
metal rose the most in a month. Gold futures for February
delivery gained 1.6 percent to settle at $1,405.60 an ounce in
New York.  General Motors , which in November raised $20 billion in an
initial public offering 16 months after emerging from
bankruptcy, rose 2.1 percent to $35.32. The automaker was rated
“overweight” in new coverage at JPMorgan, Barclays Plc and
Morgan Stanley. GM was rated “outperform” at Credit Suisse
Group AG and RBC Capital Markets, which also initiated coverage
of the stock. Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. have a
new “buy” recommendation for GM.  Homebuilders fell after the S&P/Case-Shiller index of
property values decreased 0.8 percent from October 2009, the
biggest year-over-year decline since December 2009. The drop
exceeded the 0.2 percent retreat projected by the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Homebuilders  PulteGroup Inc.  slipped 1.6 percent to $7.37,  Lennar Corp. 
declined 1 percent to $18.40 and D.R. Horton Inc. tumbled 3
percent to $11.80 as an index of 12 homebuilders in S&P indexes
lost 1.6 percent.  Short selling  of shares of  S&P 500  companies fell to a one-
year low as traders slashed bets that phone and consumer
discretionary stocks, including  Qwest Communications Inc.  and
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , will retreat, according to data
compiled by U.S. exchanges and Bloomberg.  Short interest on the benchmark U.S. equity index dropped
to 7.29 billion shares, or 4.15 percent of shares available for
trading, as of Dec. 15, down 2.9 percent from two weeks earlier,
For phone companies, it slid 12 percent to 440.9 million, and
fell 8.7 percent to 1.2 billion shares for consumer
discretionary stocks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
