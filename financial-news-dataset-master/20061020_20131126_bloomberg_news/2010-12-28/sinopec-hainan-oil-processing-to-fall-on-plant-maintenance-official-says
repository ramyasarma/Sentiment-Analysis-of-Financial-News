China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. ’s
Hainan refinery will process 7 percent less oil in January
compared with a month earlier because of scheduled maintenance
of a refining unit, a company official said.  The plant will shut a 3.1 million metric ton-a-year, or
about 62,200 barrels a day, hydro-treating unit later this week
for a month, said the official, who declined to be identified
because of company rules. Oil-processing volume will fall to
700,000 tons from 750,000 tons in December, he said.  The refinery in southern China’s Hainan Island aims to
process more crude oil in 2011 from about 8.3 million tons this
year as it won’t conduct full-plant maintenance as it did this
year, he said, without giving the exact processing volume. The
refinery under China Petroleum, Sinopec, has a designed capacity
of 8 million tons a year and can be run 10 percent beyond its
designed capacity.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editors: Jane, Ching Shen Lee, Clyde Russell  To contact the reporter on this story:
