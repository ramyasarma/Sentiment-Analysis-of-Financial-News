International Coal Ventures Ltd., a
group of Indian state-run metals and energy companies, may
consider buying a stake in Riversdale Mining Ltd., Bloomberg-UTV
reported, citing NMDC Ltd. Chairman  Rana Som .  The venture may not be interested in making a counter offer
to  Rio Tinto Group’s  A$3.9 billion ($3.9 billion) bid for the
Australian mineral explorer and producer, Som said in an
interview with the news channel. NMDC, India’s largest iron ore
producer, owns a 14 percent stake in International Coal.  Rio, the world’s third-biggest mining company, offered A$16
a share on Dec. 23 to acquire Sydney-based Riversdale and gain
access to its reserves in Mozambique.  Tata Steel Ltd. , India’s
biggest steelmaker, holds a 24.2 percent stake in the coking-
coal developer and is its largest shareholder.  Coal India Ltd. , world’s largest producer, and  Steel
Authority of India Ltd. , the nation’s second-largest, own about
28 percent each in International Coal.  NTPC Ltd.,  India’s
biggest power generator and steelmaker Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd.
hold about 14 percent each.  NMDC may increase its iron ore output to as much as 50
million metric tons by the 2015 financial year from 30 million
tons produced in the year ended March 31, Som said in the
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
