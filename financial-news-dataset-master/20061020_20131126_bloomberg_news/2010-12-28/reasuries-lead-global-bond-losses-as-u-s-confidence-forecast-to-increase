Treasuries tumbled, pushing
benchmark 10-year note yields up the most in two weeks, after
the $35 billion sale of five-year securities attracted the
lowest demand since June.  U.S. debt due in more than a year was headed for the
biggest monthly loss in the global government bond market as
primary dealers ended up with their biggest share of an auction
of the five-year maturity since July 2009. The two-year note
 yield  increased to the highest level in six months.  “Foreigners weren’t as aggressive at the sale as usual,
leaving a lot for primary dealers,” said  Jason Rogan , director
of U.S. government trading in New York at Guggenheim Partners
LLC, a brokerage for institutional investors. “It’s not looking
good for the seven-year auction tomorrow.”  The yield on the current five-year note increased 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 2.15 percent at 5 p.m. in
New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the
1.375 percent security maturing in November 2015 fell 18/32, or
$5.63 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 13/32.  The five-year note  yield  reached 2.16 percent on Dec. 16,
the highest level since June 3, advancing from the record low of
1.0148 percent touched on Nov. 4. The yield dropped three basis
points yesterday following the strongest demand at a two-year
note auction in three months.  A drop of one point in the 10-year note pushed the  yield  up
as much as 15 basis points to 3.48 percent today in the biggest
intraday gain since Dec. 14, when the Federal Reserve cited
signs of recovery after its policy meeting.  Two-Year Note  The two-year note yield increased as much as 11 basis
points to 0.75 percent, the highest level since June 16. A two-
point decrease in the 30-year bond sent the yield up as much as
15 basis points to 4.55 percent.  U.S. notes and bonds have handed investors a 2.1 percent
loss in December, paring the annual return to 5.7 percent,
according to figures compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. That’s the worst
monthly performance among 26 sovereign indexes.  The auction of the December 2015 maturity today drew a
yield of 2.149 percent, compared with 1.411 percent for the Nov.
23 sale. The increase of 74 basis points is the biggest since
the jump of 120 basis points from June 2003 to August 2003, when
the Treasury adopted monthly offerings of five-year securities.  Today’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.61, the lowest since 2.58 in June.  Primary Dealers  Primary dealers, companies obligated to participate in U.S.
auctions, bought 58.2 percent of the five-year sale, the most
since they purchased 61.6 percent in July 2009. Indirect
bidders, an investor class that includes foreign central banks,
purchased 35.6 percent of the notes, compared with 31.5 percent
last month and an average of 42.3 percent for the past 10 sales.  “The auction was much weaker than expected, and primary
dealers had to take down much more than normal,” said  Rohit Garg , an interest-rate strategist in New York at BNP Paribas
Securities SA, a primary dealer. “Going into year-end, lots of
players weren’t very comfortable taking on the risk to their
balance sheet.”  Treasuries rallied yesterday after the U.S. government’s
$35 billion auction of two-year securities drew strong demand.
Bidding was 3.71 times the debt available, the highest since a
reading of 3.78 on Sept. 27. The U.S. plans to sell $29 billion
of seven-year debt tomorrow.  Global Bonds  An index of global bonds was poised to fall for a fourth
month, the longest decline in two years, on speculation
quickening economic growth will lead stocks to outperform debt
in 2011. The  gauge  has declined 2.2 percent since the end of
August, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch figures.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 20 percent
during the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
index advanced 0.1 percent today.  Retail sales, excluding autos, rose 5.5 percent from Nov. 5
through Dec. 24, said MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse, which
measures retail sales by all payment forms. That compared with a
4.1 percent gain a year earlier. The numbers include sales made
over the Internet.  “The economic recovery should continue into the new year,
sending the unemployment rate down to 8.6 percent at the end of
2011,” said  Michael Pond , co-head of interest-rate strategy at
Barclays Plc in New York, in an interview with  Deirdre Bolton  on
Bloomberg Television’s “InsideTrack” program.  Employers added fewer jobs than forecast in November, and
the unemployment rate rose to 9.8 percent, the Labor Department
reported Dec. 3.  The Conference Board’s  consumer sentiment  index
unexpectedly decreased to 52.5 this month from a revised 54.3 in
November, the New York-based research group said today.  The Fed bought $6.78 billion of Treasuries maturing from
July 2013 through November 2014 as part of its effort to add
$600 billion to the economy through June under the second round
of quantitative easing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
