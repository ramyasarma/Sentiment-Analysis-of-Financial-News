China Petroleum & Chemical Corp .,
the nation’s largest oil refiner, got state approval to expand
its Yangzi plant in eastern China to meet local fuel demand,
said two refinery officials.  China Petroleum, known as Sinopec, aims to boost the
plant’s annual oil processing capacity to 13 million metric tons
a year, or 260,000 barrels a day, from 8 million tons, the two
officials said by telephone from Nanjing in Jiangsu province
today. They declined to be named because of company rules. The
timetable for the expansion is not yet known, they said.  Sinopec plans to build a crude distillation unit with
capacity of 8 million tons a year, scrapping an existing 3
million ton-a-year facility, one of the officials said. The
refinery has another CDU with capacity of 5 million tons a year.  Sinopec Yangzi will process more than 8 million tons of
crude in 2011, about 700,000 tons more than this year after the
plant was shut this summer for maintenance, one of the officials
said. The plant is currently running at full capacity of about
700,000 tons a month, according to the official.  Huang Wensheng , Sinopec’s Beijing-based spokesman, declined
to comment when called by Bloomberg News.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editor: Alexander Kwiatkowski, Jane Lee  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
