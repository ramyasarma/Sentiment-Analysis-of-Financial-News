Support for German Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, stood at
three percent for the second week in a row, its worst showing
since 1996, according to the weekly Forsa poll.  Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister
party, the Christian Social Union, fell one percentage point to
34 percent in the poll conducted for Stern magazine and
broadcaster RTL.  The opposition Social Democrats and the Green Party each
gained a point to 25 percent and 20 percent, respectively, not
enough to form a government, according to the poll, which had a
margin of error of 2.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
