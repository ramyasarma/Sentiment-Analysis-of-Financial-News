Japan Airlines Corp. , restructuring
under bankruptcy protection, will eliminate 170 more jobs this
month under a plan to slash the workforce by a third by March as
it reduces operations.  JAL  needs to shed 1,500 more employees to meet the goal of
trimming 16,000 positions, President  Masaru Onishi  told reporters
in Tokyo today.  The carrier is eliminating 49 routes and cutting 103
aircraft after filing for Japan’s fourth-largest bankruptcy in
January. Operating profit was 13 billion yen in November as the
Tokyo-based company cut costs and benefited from an industrywide
increase in travel demand.  “The job cuts are necessary to correspond with our
shrinking operations,” Onishi said.  Japan Airlines received court backing for its turnaround
plan last month, after being delisted from the Tokyo Stock
Exchange earlier this year.  The carrier sold 33 Boeing Co. 747s and MD-80s as of the
end of August, according to spokeswoman  Sze Hunn Yap . The
airline had  278 planes  at the end of March, according to its
website.  The airline had eliminated 8,000 jobs by September,
according to the  Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. of Japan ,
which is overseeing JAL’s turnaround and has agreed to invest
350 billion yen in the carrier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
