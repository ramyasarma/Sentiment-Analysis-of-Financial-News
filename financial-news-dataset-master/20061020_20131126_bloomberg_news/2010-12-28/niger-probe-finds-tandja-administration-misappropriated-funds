Niger’s government misappropriated
more than 64 billion CFA francs ($128.2 million) during
President  Mamadou Tandja ’s 10-year rule, said Djibril Gabriel
Martin, the general comptroller of the West African state.  An audit by the West African nation’s military junta found
the funds were embezzled between 2000 and February 2010, when
Tandja was deposed in a military coup, Martin told reporters
today in Niamey, the capital.  A committee established to recover the missing funds has so
far collected 4.77 billion francs, Martin said.  Tandja was removed from power after he made changes to the
constitution to try to extend his decade in power. A
presidential election will be held on Jan. 31 to restore
civilian rule to the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
