Trading of bullish  options  on
Russian stocks jumped to seven times the four-week average
yesterday in the U.S. after oil traded near a two-year high and
the ruble touched its strongest level in two months against the
dollar.  More than 15,200 calls to buy the  Market Vectors Russia ETF 
changed hands, the most in two months and five times the number
of puts to sell. The shares rose 0.2 percent to $37.44 and
touched $37.70, the highest  intraday level  since September 2008.
The  most-active contracts  on the ETF were January $38 calls,
which accounted for about four-fifths of the volume.  “It’s shorter-term positioning and likely someone who
wants near-term bullish exposure but doesn’t want the risk of
owning the ETF itself,” said said  Chris Jacobson , chief options
strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP in Bala Cynwyd,
Pennsylvania. “I’d definitely say it’s notable volume.”  Crude, which along with natural gas makes up about a
quarter of Russia’s economic output, traded near a 26-month high
after U.S. crude supplies were forecast to extend their biggest
monthly decline since December 2006. Russia’s currency climbed
0.4 percent to 30.2448 per dollar by the close of trading in
Moscow, the strongest since Oct. 15.  If exercised, the 14,995 January $28 calls traded yesterday
would give the right to buy almost 1.5 million shares of the
ETF. That’s more than half of the average daily volume of 2.79
million shares over the past four weeks.  Options Trading  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that  volatility , or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  Implied volatility , the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money options expiring in 30 days has rebounded from 27.14
after tumbling to a record low of 23.32 on Dec. 23. The level
has declined from this year’s peak of 89.03 in May.  “Buyers are exploiting implied volatility in the ETF
that’s near multiyear lows to position for a rally,” said  Jim Strugger , an options strategist at MKM Partners LP in Stamford,
Connecticut. “They appear to be speculating that gains in
commodity prices and related equities will continue in the
coming weeks.”  Ninety-three percent of the January $38 calls changed hands
on the ask price, while their open interest was 1,629 existing
contracts before yesterday, indicating that buyers of new
bullish contracts initiated most of the transactions. The ETF’s
last close above $38 was in September 2008.  Crude for February delivery gained 49 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $91.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange yesterday. Futures have advanced 15 percent this year.  The ruble, which added 0.2 percent to 34.599 versus the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket yesterday, has gained
3.3 percent in December versus the mechanism used to limit
swings in the currency that disadvantage exporters, its biggest
monthly advance since September 2009, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
