Nokia Siemens Networks, the world’s
second-largest maker of wireless phone systems, said the wait
for antitrust approval from China will delay the completion of
its $1.2 billion purchase of network assets from  Motorola Inc.   The acquisition will probably close in the first quarter of
2011, rather than this year, Espoo, Finland-based Nokia Siemens,
a joint venture between Nokia Oyj and Siemens AG, said today in
a statement. The deal has already been approved by U.S. and
European Union regulators, among others.  Nokia Siemens wants to boost its scale to compete with
larger rival  Ericsson AB  and lower-priced competitors such as
China’s Huawei Technologies Co. It’s also seeking to build its
presence in the U.S., where customers such as AT&T Inc. and
Verizon Communications Inc. are upgrading networks to cope with
growing demand from smartphone and laptop users.  The company said in July the deal will help it gain more
than 50 accounts at new or existing customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
