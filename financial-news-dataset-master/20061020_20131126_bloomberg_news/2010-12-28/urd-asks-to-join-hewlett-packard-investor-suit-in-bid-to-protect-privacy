Hewlett-Packard Co. ’s former Chief
Executive Officer,  Mark Hurd , asked a Delaware judge today to
allow him to intervene in a shareholder’s lawsuit so he can
fight to keep a sealed letter about his departure confidential.  Hurd, currently under investigation by the  U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission  over his departure in August, told
Delaware Chancery Court Judge  Donald Parsons Jr.  his name should
be added to the lawsuit seeking company books and records
because the letter from lawyer  Gloria Allred  is personal and his
alone.  The letter “was sent by Ms. Allred for the purpose of
attempting to arrange a private mediation and/or achieve private
resolution of a potential dispute between Mr. Hurd and Ms.  Jodie Fisher ,” who has said the letter contains “many
inaccuracies,” Hurd’s lawyers said in today’s motion.  Hurd, 53, resigned as HP’s chairman and CEO on Aug. 6,
after a company investigation of a sexual harassment-allegation
determined that he violated its standards of business conduct,
according to a statement from Hewlett-Packard. The former
contractor who made the harassment claim was later identified by
Allred as  Jodie Fisher . HP said it didn’t find that Hurd had
violated its harassment policy.  Hurd now works for software maker  Oracle Corp.  as a co-
president.  The case is Ernesto Espinoza v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,
CA6000, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
