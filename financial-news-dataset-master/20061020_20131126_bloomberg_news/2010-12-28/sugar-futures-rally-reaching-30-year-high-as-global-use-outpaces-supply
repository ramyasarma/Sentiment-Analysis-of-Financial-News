Sugar futures extended a rally to a
30-year high on mounting concern that dry weather in Brazil, the
world’s biggest producer, and record rainfall in Australia will
slash worldwide supplies.  Global demand will reach 165.3 million metric tons in the
year ending Sept. 30, topping supplies by almost 3 million tons,
ABN Amro Bank NV and VM Group have said, reversing a forecast
for a surplus. Dry weather early in the growing season and rain
during the harvest hurt crops in Brazil, according to their
report. Sugar headed for the third straight annual gain.  “The market conditions point to prices going higher,”
said   Bruno Zaneti , a risk-management consultant at FCStone
Group in Campinas, Brazil. “With volumes being very light
because of the holiday season, we may see some sharp
movements.”  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.75 cent, or 2.2
percent, to settle at 34.39 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the most-active contract
reached 34.6 cents, the highest since Nov. 25, 1980. The
commodity has gained 28 percent this year. In 2009, the price
more than doubled, marking the biggest gain in 35 years.  The rally may increase costs for candy makers Hershey Co.
and Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. and  Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. 
Zaneti said sugar may reach 40 cents within two months.  “There is reduced sugar usage or increasing use of
substitutes because of higher prices,”  Michael McDougall , a
senior vice president at Newedge USA, said today in a report.
“The companies that supply artificial sweeteners have seen
their product sales increase by leaps and bounds.”  Adverse Weather  The price has more than doubled from this year’s low of 13
cents on May 7. The record for sugar was 66 cents on Nov. 21,
1974. The highest level in the 1980s was 45.75 cents on Nov. 5,
1980.  Rain in Australia’s Queensland state this month after the
country’s wettest spring on record forced producers to leave
some sugar cane unharvested.  “Bad weather conditions are threatening crops around the
globe,”  Vibul Panitvong , the executive chairman of the Thai
Sugar Miller Corp., said last week.  Thailand is the second-largest exporter, followed by
Australia.  ‘The fundamentals remain very supportive,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures in Tampa, Florida.  In 2009, rain damaged crops in Brazil and dry weather
curbed output in India, the second-largest producer.  Estimated ICE volume today was 40,517 contracts. The daily
average in the past three months was 98,531.  The market for refined-sugar futures on NYSE Liffe in
London was closed for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
