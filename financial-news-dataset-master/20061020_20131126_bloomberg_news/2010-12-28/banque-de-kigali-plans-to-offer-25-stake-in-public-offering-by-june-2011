Banque de Kigali , Rwanda’s biggest
lender by assets, plans to sell a 25 percent stake in an initial
public offering by June 2011, Chief Operating Officer Lawson
Naibo said.  “In a week or two, we will be receiving proposals for a
lead transaction adviser to kick-start the process,” Naibo said
in an interview today from Kigali, the capital.  Rwanda began its first initial public offering on Nov. 23
when the Rwandan government sold 25 percent of its stake in
Brassieries et Limonaderies du Rwanda SA. Banque de Kigali is
wholly owned by the state.  Other companies with government ownership that intend to
sell shares on the country’s capital market include Ciments du
Rwanda Ltd., Rwanda Commercial Bank and FINA Bank, Finance
Minister  John Rwangombwa  said on Nov. 22.  Rwanda  is trying to rebuild its economy after a
experiencing a genocide in 1994 in which about 800,000 people
died in a 100-day slaughter of ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus
by Hutu militias. The massacre followed the assassination of
President  Juvenal Habyarimana .  Banque de Kigali’s assets totalled 153 billion Rwandan
francs ($258 million) in December 2009, according to the  website 
of Rwanda’s central bank.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
