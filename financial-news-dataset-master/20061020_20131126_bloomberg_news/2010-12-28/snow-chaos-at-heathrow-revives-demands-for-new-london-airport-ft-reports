Chaos caused by snow and ice at
Heathrow and other London airports in the days before Christmas
has brought renewed calls for a new airport on the south side of
the Thames estuary, east of the capital, the Financial Times
reported.  A group of former aviation executives led by John Olsen,
the ex-commercial director of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.,
called on the government to look again at proposals for a three-
runway, 24-hour airport on the thinly populated Cliffe peninsula
in Kent, the newspaper said.  The group says recent infrastructure developments such as
the high-speed Channel tunnel rail-link through north Kent and
the development of a deep-sea container port on the northern
side of the estuary have strengthened the case for an airport at
Cliffe, the FT reported.  The site was picked by the government in 2002 as having the
best potential for a new airport but dropped a year later,
partly on cost grounds, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
