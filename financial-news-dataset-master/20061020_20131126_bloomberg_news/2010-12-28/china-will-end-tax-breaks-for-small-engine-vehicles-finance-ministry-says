China will raise sales tax for small
vehicles starting next year, ending incentives that helped the
nation overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest auto market.  The government will on Jan. 1 raise the tax on vehicles
with engines of 1.6 liters or smaller to 10 percent from 7.5
percent, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement  on its
website today . China halved the rate to 5 percent in 2009 before
increasing it to the current level this year.  Measures such as consumption-tax rebate, subsidies for
rural car buyers and incentives to trade in older models helped
China’s industrywide vehicle sales jump 46 percent last year to
13.6 million. The mainland surpassed the U.S. for the first time
in 2009 to become the world’s biggest automobile market.  China’s total vehicle sales including trucks and buses
surged 34 percent to 16.4 million in the 11 months through
November, the China Automobile Industry Association said earlier
this month.  -- Liza Lin . Editors:  Vipin V. Nair ,  Suresh Seshadri .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
