Mozambique’s Cahora Bassa hydropower
dam increased the electricity it generates by 14 percent, the
state-run company managing the facility said.  The plant will produce 1,920 megawatts of power compared
with 1,680 megawatts before an upgrade of conversion bridges,
Maputo-based Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa, known as HCB, said
in an e-mailed statement today. It didn’t specify when the
upgrade started.  HCB will start extensive rehabilitation and modernization
of a substation in the northwest Songo district, the company
said, without giving more details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
