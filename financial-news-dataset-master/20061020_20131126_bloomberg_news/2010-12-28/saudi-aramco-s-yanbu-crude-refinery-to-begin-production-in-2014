Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest
state-owned oil company, said its planned refinery in the
industrial city of Yanbu will start production in 2014.  The refinery will process 400,000 barrels of heavy crude a
day to produce diesel and gasoline with byproducts of sulfur and
petroleum coke, the company said on its website yesterday.  The start was delayed from 2013 after  ConocoPhillips  opted
out of the project to reduce its presence in the crude-
processing business. Saudi Aramco in July formed the subsidiary,
Red Sea Refining Co., to run the plant and in the same month
gave final approval to start construction.  The management board of the refinery held its first meeting
on Dec. 25 in Dhahran. Saudi Aramco board member, Salim S. Al-
Aydh, was named chairman and Fahad Al-Helal was appointed
president and chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
