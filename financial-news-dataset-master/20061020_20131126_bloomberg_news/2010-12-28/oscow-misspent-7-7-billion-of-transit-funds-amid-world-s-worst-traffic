Russia’s Audit Chamber said
authorities misspent more than 232 billion rubles ($7.7 billion)
earmarked for the development of the Moscow transportation
infrastructure in the past three years.  “Nearly half” of 500 billion rubles allocated for the
city’s transport system in 2008 to 2010 have been spent with
violations, Sergei Ryabukhin, an auditor with the budget
watchdog, told reporters in Moscow today.  The largest violations involved 120 billion rubles of state
purchases and 85 billion rubles of budget investments, according
to materials distributed to reporters.  Moscow drivers suffer the longest traffic jams of the
world’s 20 major cities, and the average motorist spent 2 1/2
hours stuck in traffic at least once in the last three years,
International Business Machines Corp. said in a study in July.  Moscow’s newly appointed Mayor  Sergei Sobyanin  last month
presented a five-year plan to solve the world’s worst traffic,
including restrictions on long-haul trucks entering Moscow from
7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays. The city government will spend
200 billion rubles a year on transportation infrastructure
starting in 2011, expanding the road and subway systems and
adding parking spaces, Sobyanin said Dec. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
