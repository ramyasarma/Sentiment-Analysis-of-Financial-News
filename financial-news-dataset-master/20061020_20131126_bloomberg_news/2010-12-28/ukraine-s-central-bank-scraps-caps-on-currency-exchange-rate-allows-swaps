Ukraine’s central bank scrapped
limits on currency-exchange rates and decided to let lenders
carry out swap exchanges with the central bank.  The Kiev-based  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy  annulled its 2004
rule that permitted lenders to trade as much as 2 percent above
or below the official exchange rate, according to the central
bank resolution published today in the Uryadovyi Kurier
newspaper. The bank also abolished a rule that allows for only
one change in the exchange rate per day, according to the
resolution, which comes into effect from today.  Lenders will now be able to hold swap operations with the
central bank, according to the resolution. The NBU, will be able
to carry out currency interventions on the swap conditions with
a term of up to three months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
