Commodities extended a rally to the
highest in more than 26 months, led today by gains in cotton and
sugar, as economic optimism bolstered demand.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities
climbed as much as 0.7 percent to 331.38, the highest since Oct.
2, 2008. Before today, the gauge jumped 27 percent since June 30
amid surging Chinese demand for raw materials. Sugar prices
climbed to the highest since November 1980, and cotton added as
much as 2.6 percent.  “We’re in the great commodity bull cycle,” said  Matt Zeman , a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group. “China is
going to drive consumption, and you’re going to have a dollar
that’s going to work its way lower. We’re seeing a turnaround in
nearly every sector of the economy.”  The CRB Index rose 1.48, or 0.4 percent, to 330.59 at 9:36
a.m. in New York. Before today, the gauge was up 16 percent this
year, headed for a second straight annual gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
