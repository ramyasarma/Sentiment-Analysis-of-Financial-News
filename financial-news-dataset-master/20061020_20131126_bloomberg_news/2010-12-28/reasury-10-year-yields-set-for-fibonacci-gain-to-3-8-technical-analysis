Treasury 10-year note  yields  may
advance toward 3.8 percent, the highest level since April, Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  Yields touched a seven-month high of 3.56 percent on Dec.
16 after climbing above 3.36 percent on Dec. 13. The 3.36
percent level represents a 61.8 percent retracement of the
yield’s decline from this year’s high of 4 percent on April 5 to
a low of 2.33 percent on Oct. 8, based on a series of numbers
known as Fibonacci sequence.  “Given the uptrend, the near-term target for yields is
3.61 percent, a 76.4 percent retracement,” said  Kenichi Imai ,
chief manager of proprietary trading at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ, a unit of Japan’s largest banking group. “Yields have room
to climb to 3.75 to 3.8 percent.”  Ten-year notes yielded 3.48 percent at 8:10 a.m. in Tokyo,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent security
maturing in November 2020 traded at a price of 92 28/32.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. Key
percentages include 23.6, 38.2, 50 and 61.8. In technical
