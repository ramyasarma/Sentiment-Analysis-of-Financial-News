China detained six people in the
northern province of Hebei for allegedly producing contaminated
wines with chemicals, the country’s quality watchdog said in a
statement today.  The city government in Qinghuangdao, Hebei has frozen 2.8
million yuan ($423,000) in 16 bank accounts of companies that
are allegedly producing sub-standard wines, according to a
statement on the  website  of the General Administration of
Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.  The Chinese government has been working to enhance the
nation’s food safety standards two years after at least six
infants died and about 300,000 children fell sick drinking milk
tainted with melamine, a toxic chemical.  China’s new food safety rules need to be enforced to help
improve standards of domestic food producers, Peter Ben Embarek,
a food safety officer with the World Health Organization, said
in October.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
