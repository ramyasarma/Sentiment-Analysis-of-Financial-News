The dollar fell against most of its
major counterparts as signs of global economic recovery spurred
demand for higher-yielding assets including stocks.  The greenback weakened versus the New Zealand and
Australian dollars on reduced demand for safety before a U.S.
report tomorrow forecast to show initial jobless claims fell.
Sweden’s krona appreciated versus as the nation’s trade surplus
widened in November. Taiwan’s dollar rose to a 13-year high on
the prospect of an increase in borrowing costs.  “January tends to be risk-on, and if you’re expecting risk
assets to do well, now’s a good time to get in,” said  Geoffrey Yu , a London-based currency strategist at UBS AG. “There’s some
seasonality in terms of flow patterns, and if funds have fresh
liquidity there’s more money to invest.”  The dollar dropped against the yen for an eighth day,
decreasing 0.3 percent to 82.12 at 7:42 a.m. in New York, from
82.38 yesterday. The U.S. currency was little changed at $1.3130
versus the euro, compared with $1.3115. The euro fell 0.1
percent to 107.92 yen, from 108.06.  Sweden’s krona appreciated 0.5 percent to 6.8407 per dollar
after a report showed the nation’s trade surplus reached the
highest this year as exports increased.  Riksbank Governor  Stefan Ingves  has raised the benchmark
repo rate four times since July even as inflation remains below
the bank’s 2 percent target. The increases have been made as
house prices move above pre-crisis levels and credit growth
hovers near 9 percent.  Taiwan’s Dollar  Taiwan’s dollar advanced for a third day versus the
greenback as economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said the
central bank’s  discount rate  on 10-day loans will be raised by
12.5 basis points to 1.625 percent at a policy meeting tomorrow.  Borrowing costs in Taiwan were increased by similar amounts
in June and September, and the current level of 1.5 percent
compares with an inflation rate of 1.53 percent. A basis point
equals 0.01 percentage point.  “The market is quite certain the central bank will raise
rates tomorrow,” said  Tarsicio Tong , a Taipei-based currency
trader at Union Bank of Taiwan. “Real interest rates are still
in negative territory. The bond market is still reflecting
inflation worries.”  Taiwan’s dollar touched NT$29.375, the strongest level
since October 1997. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index,
which tracks the region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding
the yen, was little changed at 115.49 after reaching 115.50, the
highest since Nov. 18.  Commodity Gains  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities
climbed as much as 0.9 percent to 332.15 yesterday, the highest
since October 2008, boosting demand for currencies including
Australia and New Zealand’s dollars that are linked to raw-
materials prices.  The U.S. dollar depreciated 0.8 percent to 76.15 cents
versus New Zealand’s kiwi, from 75.56 yesterday. The U.S.
currency slid for an eighth day against the Australian dollar,
weakening 0.4 percent to $1.0140, from $1.0100. The greenback’s
stretch of decreases versus the Aussie is the longest since
March 2009.  Benchmark interest rates of 4.75 percent in Australia and 3
percent in New Zealand make the South Pacific nations’ assets
attractive to investors seeking higher returns, also boosting
the Aussie and kiwi.  March contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained
0.2 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.7 percent.  Dollar Index  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners including the euro, yen and pound, dropped 0.2 percent
to 80.262, trimming its 2010 increase to 3.1 percent.  First-time filings for jobless insurance decreased to
415,000 in the week ended Dec. 25 from 420,000 in the previous
week, according to the median forecast of 26 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The report from the Labor Department is
due at 8:30 a.m. New York time tomorrow.  The Federal Reserve reiterated this month its commitment to
keeping borrowing costs low for an “extended period” as data
signals an uneven recovery in the world’s largest economy. The
central bank said last month it will buy $600 billion of
Treasuries through June to boost the economy under the second
round of quantitative easing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
