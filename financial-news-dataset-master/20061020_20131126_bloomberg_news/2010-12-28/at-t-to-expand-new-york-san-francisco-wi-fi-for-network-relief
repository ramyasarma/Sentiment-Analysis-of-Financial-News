AT&T Inc.  is expanding its free
wireless-Internet service to more public areas in New York and
San Francisco to help relieve its mobile-phone network in two of
the most congested U.S. cities.  The company will widen the reach of its Wi-Fi service in
Times Square following a trial there and is adding so-called
hotspots around Rockefeller Center, according to a statement
today. The second-largest U.S. mobile-phone carrier also plans a
hotspot near San Francisco’s Embarcadero Center shopping area.  AT&T has said the prevalence of data-hungry devices such as
the  Apple Inc.  iPhone has led to network congestion in some
cities, particularly New York and San Francisco. The company,
which competes against Verizon Wireless, is also upgrading its
mobile-phone network to improve performance.  AT&T, based in Dallas, said it handled 106.9 million
connections on its Wi-Fi networks in the third quarter, compared
with 85.5 million during all of last year.  Wi-Fi will be available free to users with enabled devices
on AT&T’s network. The carrier also offers Wi-Fi service in
numerous coffee shops and mailing centers, according to its
website.  AT&T dropped 2 cents to $29.23 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares have risen 4.3 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
