The European Central Bank failed to
fully neutralize the extra liquidity created by its bond
purchases for a second time since the program began in May.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said today it drained 60.78 billion
euros ($80.66 billion) from money markets via seven-day term
deposits, almost 13 billion euros less than the 73.5 billion
euros it intended to absorb.  Banks tend to prefer to hold on to cash at the end of the
year, when liquidity needs increase, said  Karsten Junius , senior
economist at Dekabank in Frankfurt. “The allotment therefore
doesn’t mean much for the situation in the money market,” he
said.  The central bank started buying government bonds on May 10
in an effort to restore confidence in markets rattled by the
sovereign debt crisis. To ensure the purchases don’t swell the
money supply and create inflation risks, the ECB each week
drains the amount of extra liquidity it has created by offering
banks seven-day term deposits.  The ECB also failed to fully neutralize its bond purchases
in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
