Corn and soybean prices extended
rallies to 28-month highs as adverse weather threatens crops in
Argentina and Brazil, the world’s biggest exporters behind the
U.S.  Dry weather and temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit
(38 Celsius) in parts of Argentina will increase stress on corn
plants as they reproduce and delay soybean growth, Chicago-based
T-Storm Weather LLC said in a report today. Drier conditions are
developing in southern Brazil, with too much rain in the north
threatening some fields, the private forecaster said.  “Concerns about crops in South America are increasing,”
said  Doug Bergman , a grain broker at Advantage Traders Group in
Chicago. “The markets are rising to slow down demand” as world
supplies decline, he said.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 8 cents, or 1.3
percent, to close at $6.2325 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $6.2425, the
highest for the most-active contract since August 2008. The
grain, used to make animal feed, fuel and food, has jumped 26
percent this quarter.  Soybean futures for March delivery advanced 2.5 cents, or
0.2 percent, to close at $13.87 a bushel. Earlier, the price
reached $13.9675, the highest since August 2008. The most-active
futures have climbed 25 percent this quarter amid record Chinese
demand for U.S. supplies.  Moisture Deficits  Projected moisture deficits in Argentina from Oct. 15 to
Jan. 6 will range from as much as 9.6 inches (24.4 centimeters)
in the state of Buenos Aires to 4.2 inches in Cordoba, said  Mike Tannura , the president of T-Storm Weather. That’s as much as 80
percent below normal and drier than the same period from 2008 to
2009, when corn production fell 32 percent from a year earlier
and soybean output dropped 31 percent, he said.  “About 60 percent of the corn-growing region has
significant moisture deficits, and about a third of the
soybeans,” Chicago-based Tannura said in a telephone interview.
“If it doesn’t start to rain by the middle of January, this
year’s dryness may be a severe as the drought two years ago.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
