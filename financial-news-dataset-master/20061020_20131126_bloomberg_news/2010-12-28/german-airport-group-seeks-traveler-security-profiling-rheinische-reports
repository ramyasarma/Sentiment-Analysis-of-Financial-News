Passengers at German airports should
be divided into risk groups for purposes of security checks, the
future president of the ADV association of German airports  told 
the Rheinische Post newspaper.  So-called profiling, in effect at airports in Israel and
announced for the U.K., would allow security services to adapt
the intensity of searches to the security risk, Christoph Blume,
president of the ADV from Jan. 1, told the newspaper.  At airports in Israel, characteristics including ethnical
origin, religion, age and personal circumstances of passengers,
as well as the itinerary, mode of payment and location of the
ticket purchase determine the security risk posed by travelers,
the newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  So-called body scanners, being tested at Hamburg airport,
are a “promising technology,” Blume also said, adding that
German authorities will decide on their country-wide deployment
early next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
