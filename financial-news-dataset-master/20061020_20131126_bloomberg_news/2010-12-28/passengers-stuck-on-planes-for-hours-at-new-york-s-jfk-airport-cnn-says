Passengers on multiple planes
arriving in New York were stuck on the tarmac for hours at John
F. Kennedy International Airport because of a lack of terminal
space and customs processing capacity, CNN reported, citing
passengers, airlines and Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey spokesman Steve Coleman.  One of the planes was a Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. flight
from Vancouver that landed today at 2:15 a.m. and was still on
the tarmac this afternoon, according to the report.  A British
Airways Plc plane was stranded for seven hours and it was six
hours before passengers on an Aeromexico flight were able to get
off the plane, according to the report.   U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman John Saleh said
the agency was amply staffed and denied that customs issues
contributed to the problem, CNN said. Coleman said the port
authority has to “look into the whole situation,” CNN
reported.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
