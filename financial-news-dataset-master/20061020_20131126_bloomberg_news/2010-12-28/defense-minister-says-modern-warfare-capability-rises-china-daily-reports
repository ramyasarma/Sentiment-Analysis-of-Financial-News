China’s Defense Minister Liang
Guanglie said the ability of the nation’s military to engage in
modern warfare has increased “sharply,” the China Daily
reported today.  The nation’s economy and society will develop quickly in
the next five years, providing an even more stable base for the
buildup of China’s defense and military, the newspaper cited
Liang as saying. Without the nation’s military of more than 2
million soldiers, China would be a “weak country,” Liang was
quoted as saying.  The modernization of China’s military still lags that of
developed nations, Liang was cited as saying. Modernizing
China’s military can’t depend on other nations and can’t be
bought, Liang was cited as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
