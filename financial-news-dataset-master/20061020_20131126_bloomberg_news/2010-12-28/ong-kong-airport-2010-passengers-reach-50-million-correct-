Hong Kong’s airport handled a record
50 million passengers this year and moved more than 4 million
tons of cargo as economic growth in China helped boost travel.  The airport has set a target of handling 6 million tons of
cargo and 70 million passengers annually by 2020, Transport
Secretary  Eva Cheng  said in Hong Kong today. The 50 millionth
passenger arrived Dec. 25,  Airport Authority Hong Kong  said in a
 statement .  Hong Kong’s government will start by the middle of next
year public consultations on plans to build a third runway, said
 Stanley Hui , the airport authority’s chief executive officer.
The consultations may take as long as three months, he said.  “The booming economic growth in China and Hong Kong is
bringing about increased trade and travel,” Hui said. “We want
to better develop our airport infrastructure to support” it.  The city’s visitor  arrivals  in the first 11 months
surpassed its 2009 full-year numbers, bolstering consumer
spending and helping third-quarter economic growth beat
estimates. Hong Kong’s  gross domestic product  expanded at an
annual pace of 6.8 percent in the third quarter.  Traffic at the airport may reach a record daily peak of
almost  170,000  passengers during the holiday season, Hui said in
a statement on Dec. 19. The airport operator’s  net income rose
50 percent  from a year earlier to HK$1.96 billion ($252 million)
in the six months ended Sept. 30. Sales gained 19 percent to
HK$5.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
