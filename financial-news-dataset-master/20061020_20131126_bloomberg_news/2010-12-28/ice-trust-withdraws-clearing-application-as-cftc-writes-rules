ICE Trust U.S. LLC, the world’s
largest clearinghouse for credit-default swaps, withdrew its
application to the U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  to
be registered as a clearing organization.  ICE Trust, owned by Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange
Inc., said in a Dec. 23 letter to the CFTC that it was
withdrawing its application because of “significant changes”
proposed to regulations for derivatives clearing organizations,
or DCOs. The proposed rules are required by mid-July under the
Dodd-Frank financial-regulation law.  Kelly Loeffler , vice president at Intercontinental Exchange
Inc., said in an e-mail that the company “anticipates
transitioning to a DCO once final policy is completed.”  The CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission are leading
U.S. efforts to write new regulations for the $583 trillion
swaps market, after largely unregulated trades complicated
efforts to resolve the 2008 credit crisis. The law aims to boost
transparency and reduce risk by moving most swaps to central
clearinghouses that help guarantee transactions.  ICE Trust, which is currently regulated by the Federal
Reserve and New York State Banking Department, had applied on
 Nov. 12  with the CFTC to be regulated as a designated clearing
organization. ICE Trust has cleared  $8.6 trillion  of credit-
default swaps as of Dec. 10, the company said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
