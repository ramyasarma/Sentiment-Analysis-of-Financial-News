Sallies Ltd. , a South African
fluorspar producer, rose the most in more than eight months
after  Maghreb Minerals Plc  agreed to buy 66.9 percent of the
company’s stock from Firebird Global Master Fund.  The stock advanced 3 cents, or 33 percent, its biggest
intraday gain since April 12, to 12 cents, where it was trading
as of 11:45 a.m. in Johannesburg.  The transaction lifts Maghreb’s stake in Sallies to 78.3
percent, which triggers a mandatory offer to investors and
results in a change of control, the Pretoria-based company said
in a regulatory statement today.  The agreement is conditional on Maghreb raising $10
million, the company said in a Dec. 24 filing. The purchase will
be a “major step” in Maghreb’s strategy to build critical mass
in fluorspar,  Richard Linnell , Maghreb’s chairman, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
