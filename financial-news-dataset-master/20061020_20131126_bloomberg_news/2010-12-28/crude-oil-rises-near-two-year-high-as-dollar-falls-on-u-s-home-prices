Oil traded near a 26-month high
after a report showed U.S. retailers had their best holiday
sales in five years and U.S. crude supplies were forecast to
extend their biggest monthly decline since December 2006.  Oil advanced after MasterCard reported holiday sales rose
5.5 percent to $584 billion from Nov. 5 through Dec. 24,
compared with 4.1 percent a year earlier. Oil  inventories  shrank
for the fourth consecutive week, according to the median
estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey, the longest
stretch of declines in a year.  “We’re staying in the $90 area, with an eye on hitting
$100 in the new year,” said  Carl Larry , president of Oil
Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “Demand is picking up and
should rise further in coming months.”  Crude for February delivery gained 46 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $91.46 a barrel at 1:40 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Futures have advanced 15 percent this year.
Crude touched $91.88, the highest price since October 2008,
yesterday in intraday trading.  Brent crude for February settlement increased 49 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $94.34 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  U.S. fuel consumption  averaged over four weeks, a measure
of demand, rose to 19.7 million barrels a day in the period
through Dec. 17, the highest level since February 2009,
according to Energy Department data released last week.  U.S. Inventories  Crude stockpiles probably decreased 3 million barrels in
the seven days ended Dec. 24 from 340.7 million the prior week,
according to the median  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News before a government report this week. Supplies
have fallen this month by 19 million barrels, or 5.3 percent,
the biggest monthly decline in four years.  The Energy Department will release its weekly report at 11
a.m. Dec. 30 in Washington, a day later than usual because of
Christmas. The American Petroleum Institute, which collects
stockpile information on a voluntary basis, will release its
report tomorrow, also a day later than usual.  Oil, which rallied 78 percent in 2009, has risen this year
as signs of a global economic recovery bolstered optimism fuel
demand will grow.  Commodities Surge  At a time when money managers’ concerns have swung between
record government stimulus and the potential for a new
recession, investors remain bullish on commodities that beat
stocks and bonds for a second year.  The benchmark Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge advanced 20
percent, more than the 9.1 percent gain in the MSCI World Index
of stocks and 5.3 percent return on a Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index of Treasuries. Currency traders are betting on a
stronger dollar, sending a contrarian signal because commodities
moved in an opposite direction to the currency in 16 of the past
20 quarters, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Commodities have had a fantastic year,” said  Phil Flynn ,
a Chicago-based analyst and trader with investment adviser
PFGBest. “A lot of it is good old-fashioned economic optimism.
They look at numbers like the retail sales this morning and the
stock market and get the sense that the economy is doing much
better. The market is looking ahead of itself.”  S&P’s GSCI index fell 0.3 percent to 626.20 yesterday,
ending five days of gains. The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index  of 19 commodities reached an intraday high of 332.15
today, the strongest level since Oct. 2, 2008. It was at 331.76
at 1:40 p.m. in New York.  End-of-Year Trading  Earlier today, oil fell as much as 0.3 percent to touch
$90.75 a barrel. The Conference Board’s  confidence index 
unexpectedly decreased in December to 52.5, less than the lowest
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The S&P Case-Schiller index of property values fell 0.8
percent from October 2009, the biggest year-over-year decline
since December 2009, the group said today in New York. The
figure fell more than forecast.  “We’re in the midst of very quiet, end-of-year trading,”
said  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover Inc., a trading
adviser in New Canaan, Connecticut. “A lot of people are taking
the week off. If someone had a stray idea and decided to move
the market in either direction, it would be hard to stop them.
This would be more likely to happen to the upside.”  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 136,951
contracts as of 1:41 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 184,523
contracts yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 24, 2009. Open
interest was 1.4 million contracts, the most since Nov. 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
