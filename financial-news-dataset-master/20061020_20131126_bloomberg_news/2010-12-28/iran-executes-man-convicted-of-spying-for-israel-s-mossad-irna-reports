Iran hanged a man convicted of
spying for Israel by gathering intelligence that included the
number of the country’s fighter jets.  Ali-Akbar Siadat was executed at Tehran’s Evin prison at
dawn, the official  Islamic Republic News Agency  reported today.
Siadat had established relations with Israel’s spy agency in
2005, according to IRNA, which cited a report from the office of
Tehran’s prosecutor.  Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  has said Israel is
doomed to disappear and described the Holocaust as a
fabrication. The Jewish state, the U.S. and European nations say
the Iranian government is seeking to develop atomic weapons.
Iran says its nuclear program is aimed at peaceful purposes.  “The Iran terror regime will use any pretext to sow fear
and horror among the population,”  Yigal Palmor , an Israeli
Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a phone interview.  Israel’s Mossad intelligence service had asked Siadat to
provide classified information about Iran for $60,000, the news
agency reported. He held meetings with Mossad agents in
countries such as the Netherlands, Turkey and Thailand,
according to the report. He was arrested in 2008 while trying to
leave the country with his wife, IRNA said.  Siadat gathered intelligence about Iran’s air force, IRNA
reported. It didn’t explain how he had access to such
information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
