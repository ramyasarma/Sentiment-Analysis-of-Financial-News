U.S. stocks  drifted  between gains
and losses as data on retail sales, consumer confidence and home
prices presented a mixed picture of the outlook for the world’s
largest economy.  General Motors Co. rose 2.8 percent after at least seven
firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley
initiated coverage of the automaker with a positive view.
American Express Co., Caterpillar Inc. and Walt Disney Co. lost
at least 0.6 percent to lead declines in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average . Homebuilders retreated as home prices
dropped more than forecast in October.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,258.09 at 1:20 p.m. in New York and is up 6.6 percent this
month, poised for its best December since 1991. The Dow rose
18.39 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,573.42.  “The two numbers we’ve seen today have been
disappointing,” said Philadelphia Trust Co.’s Chief Investment
Officer  Richard Sichel , referring to the consumer and home price
data. “But the consumer is spending anyway and fundamentals
always drive the market a little less at the end of the year as
some people take losses and others take gains for various
reasons,” said Sichel, who helps manage $1.5 billion.  The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index decreased
to 52.5, lower than the most pessimistic forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News and down from a revised 54.3 in
November. U.S. retail sales, excluding autos, rose 5.5 percent
to $584 billion from Nov. 5 through Dec. 24 for the biggest
holiday-season increase since 2005, according to MasterCard
Advisors’ SpendingPulse, which measures retail sales by all
payment forms.  Homebuilders Slump  Homebuilders fell after the S&P/Case-Shiller index of
property values decreased 0.8 percent from October 2009, the
biggest year-over-year decline since December 2009. The drop
exceeded the 0.2 percent drop projected by the median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  PulteGroup Inc.  slipped 2.3 percent to $7.32,  Lennar Corp. 
declined 1.2 percent to $18.36 and D.R. Horton Inc. tumbled 2.6
percent to $11.84 as an index of 12 homebuilders in S&P indexes
lost 1.5 percent.  General Motors  rose 2.8 percent to $35.57. The automaker
was rated “overweight” in new coverage at JPMorgan, Barclays
Plc and Morgan Stanley. GM was rated “outperform” at Credit
Suisse Group AG and RBC Capital Markets, which also initiated
coverage of the stock. Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp.
have a new “buy” recommendation for GM.  Short Sales Subside  Short selling  of shares of  S&P 500  companies fell to a one-
year low as traders slashed bets that phone and consumer
discretionary stocks, including  Qwest Communications Inc.  and
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , will retreat, according to data
compiled by U.S. exchanges and Bloomberg.  Short interest on the benchmark U.S. equity index dropped
to 7.29 billion shares, or 4.15 percent of shares available for
trading, as of Dec. 15, down 2.9 percent from two weeks earlier,
For phone companies, it slid 12 percent to 440.9 million, and
fell 8.7 percent to 1.2 billion shares for consumer
discretionary stocks.  Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction
equipment, lost 0.6 percent to $93.48 while  Disney , the world’s
biggest media company, retreated 0.6 percent to $37.28. American
Express declined 0.9 percent to $42.64.  Hasbro Inc. , the world’s second-largest toymaker, fell 2.1
percent to $47.51.  Energy and commodity companies led gains among 10 groups in
the S&P 500, while consumer and industrial shares had the
biggest declines. About 468 million shares changed hands on the
NYSE yesterday, the fewest for a full-day session since May
1998, as trading slowed following a snowstorm. New York
commuters and travelers face further disruptions today as winds
hinder efforts to clear roads and runways following the heaviest
December snows in six decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
