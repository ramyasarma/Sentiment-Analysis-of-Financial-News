The rand strengthened to the
strongest level in almost three years against the dollar as
rising prices for precious metals and South Africa’s higher
interest rates relative to developed markets lured investors.  The rand was the biggest gainer versus the dollar among
emerging-market currencies today, appreciating as much as 1.5
percent to 6.6443 per dollar, the strongest level since December
2007. It traded at 6.6787 by 5:01 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a
previous close of 6.7445. Against the euro, the rand added 1
percent to 8.7796.  Gold, which along with platinum accounts for about a fifth
of South Africa’s exports, advanced for a third day as a decline
in the dollar boosted the value of commodities prices in U.S.
currency. Platinum rose as much as 1.2 percent to $1,755.75 an
ounce, the highest level since Nov. 12.  “The fact that commodity prices have ramped even higher
suggests that the rand will continue to benefit,” Tradition
Analytics analysts wrote in a note to client today. “The rand
is already anticipated to strengthen further in 2011 with all
this liquidity creation likely to keep the demand for yield
intact.”  The rand has rallied 41 percent since the start of last
year as developed nations cut their interest rates to near-zero
levels to pull their economies out of recession. Rates as low as
0.1 percent in Japan and 0.25 percent in the U.S encouraged
investors to place their money in higher-yielding markets like
South Africa, where the  benchmark rate  is 5.5 percent, even
after nine cuts since December 2008.  Government bonds rose for the first day in five, with the
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 adding 9
cents to 123.84 rand. The yield fell 2 basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 7.41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
