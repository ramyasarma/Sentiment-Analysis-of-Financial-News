India’s Gujarat state is drafting a
policy to promote geothermal energy, the Economic Times
reported, citing Chief Minister  Narendra Modi .  The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy has identified
Gujarat as one of the states with potential for setting up
geothermal power plants, according to the report.  Geothermal energy is produced by tapping heat contained in
rocks and water deep underground. Gujarat set a  policy  in
January 2009 for developing solar energy. The state has awarded
716 megawatts in solar projects to companies, according to the
 website  of the Gujarat Energy Development Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
