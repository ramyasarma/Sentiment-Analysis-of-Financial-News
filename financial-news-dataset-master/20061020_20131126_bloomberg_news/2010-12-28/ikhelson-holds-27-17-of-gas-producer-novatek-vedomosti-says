Billionaire  Leonid Mikhelson  owns
27.17 percent of OAO Novatek, the Russian gas producer that he
heads, directly and indirectly, Denis Solovev, a company
spokesman, said, confirming a report in Vedomosti today.  Mikhelson, who has a fortune of $4.4 billion, according to
Forbes Russia, and  Gennady Timchenko , a Novatek shareholder and
board member and co-founder of energy trader Gunvor
International BV, together have a controlling stake of more than
50 percent of Novatek.  Mikhelson and Timchenko have a two-year option to buy 9.4
percent of Novatek from OAO Gazprombank, the gas producer said
Dec. 21. The Moscow-based lender had acquired the Novatek stake
from OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas export monopoly, a day earlier.  Gazprom doesn’t plan to cut its stake below 10 percent,
Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Miller  said on Nov. 13.  Timchenko’s investment fund, Volga Resources SICAV SIF SA,
holds about 23.13 percent, according to its website, after
gaining antitrust approval to buy as much as 23.49 percent last
year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Anna
