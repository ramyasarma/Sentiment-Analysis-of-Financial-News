The African Union appointed Kenyan
Prime Minister, Raila Odinga, to assist in talks aimed at
resolving the political crisis in Ivory Coast.  Odinga will help “strengthen the chances of success” of
talks between Gbagbo and the presidents of Benin, Sierra Leone
and Cape Verde, who are due to arrive in Ivory Coast today, the
African Union said in a statement on its website.  President Laurent Gbagbo has refused to relinquish power to
Alassane Ouattara, who is recognized by the United Nations as
the winner of the Nov. 28 election.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
