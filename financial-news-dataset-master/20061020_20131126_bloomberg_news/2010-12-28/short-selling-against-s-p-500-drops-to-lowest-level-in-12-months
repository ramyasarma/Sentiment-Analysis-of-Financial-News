Wagers against  the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index  fell to a one-year low as short sellers slashed bets
that phone and consumer discretionary stocks, including  Qwest
Communications Inc.  and  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , will retreat.  Short interest on the  S&P 500  dropped to 7.29 billion
shares, or 4.15 percent of shares available for trading, as of
Dec. 15, down 2.9 percent from two weeks earlier, according to
data compiled by U.S. exchanges and Bloomberg. For phone
companies, it slid 12 percent to 440.9 million, and fell 8.7
percent to 1.2 billion shares for consumer discretionary stocks.  "There’s been a lot of optimism in the market and it shows
in many ways," said  Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.5 billion as
chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co. "None of the
main indicators make you want to move out of stocks other than
for individual reasons."  The S&P 500, up 13 percent in 2010 through yesterday,
increased 4.6 percent during the first two weeks of December. It
has advanced 6.5 percent in December after losing 0.2 percent in
November and posting a combined gain of 13 percent in September
and October, the biggest increases during those months since
1998. The measure has rallied 20 percent since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke   suggested  on Aug. 27 that he was prepared to
purchase bonds to spur economic growth.  Short interest on Qwest, the Denver-based phone company
that was acquired by CenturyLink Inc. earlier this year, tumbled
42 percent to 83.1 million shares, or 4.8 percent. Bets against
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , the New Albany, Ohio-based teen-
clothing retailer that has almost doubled in New York Stock
Exchange trading since June, sank 35 percent to 6.9 million
shares, or 8 percent, over the same period.  Sears Holdings Corp.  and  First Solar Inc.  are the most
shorted stocks in the benchmark index for U.S. equities. Short
selling in Sears, the largest U.S. department-store chain, is at
32 percent of float, while it is 30 percent for First Solar, the
world’s biggest maker of thin-film solar modules.  U.S. stock exchanges release data on short selling, or the
sale of borrowed stock with the hope of buying it back at a
lower price, every two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
