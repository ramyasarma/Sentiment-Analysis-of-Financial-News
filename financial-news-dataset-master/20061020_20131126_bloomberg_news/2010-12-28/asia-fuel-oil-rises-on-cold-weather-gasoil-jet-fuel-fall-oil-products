Asia fuel oil rose amid speculation
that cold weather in the northern hemisphere will raise demand
at power generators. Jet fuel and gasoil fell for a second day.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for January gained for the first
time in four days, gaining 0.2 percent to $515.50 a metric ton,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates, a brokerage.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude, a measure of refining
losses from making the fuel in Asia, narrowed to $11.34 a barrel
at 10 a.m. Singapore time from $11.53 yesterday, according to
data from PVM. The spread was $11.80 a barrel on Dec. 24, the
widest since January 2009.  Japan was forecast to have colder temperatures in the
second half of December as the weather patterns that caused
freezing conditions in the U.S. and Europe envelop the country,
boosting demand for gas and power from companies including Tokyo
Electric Power Co.  Middle Distillates  January swaps for  gasoil  dropped 0.2 percent to $104.25 a
barrel, PVM data showed.  Jet fuel  swaps also fell 0.2 percent to
$105.70 a barrel. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude lost 20 cents
to $13.60 a barrel, indicating the lowest refining profit since
Dec. 21. This  crack spread  rose to $15.43 on Dec. 7, the widest
since January 2009.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged at $1.45 a
barrel. This  regrade  has increased 25 cents from Dec. 20,
signaling that aviation-fuel production is more profitable than
diesel for refiners compared with a week earlier.  Naphtha  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward

against offers at $887 a ton, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. First-half March lots were bid at
