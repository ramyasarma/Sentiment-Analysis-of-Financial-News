GS Engineering & Construction Corp. 
surged the most in 20 months in Seoul, leading gains among South
Korean builders, after the nation’s land ministry announced
plans to support the industry.  GS Engineering  climbed  9.6 percent to 114,000 won at the
close on the Korea Exchange, the most since April 2, 2009. The
benchmark  Kospi  stock index added 0.6 percent. The 36-member
Korea Construction Index surged 3.4 percent, the  best performer 
among the Kospi’s 19 industry groups.  The Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs plans
to spend more than 60 percent of its 2011 infrastructure budget
in the first half, and may buy unsold apartments in provincial
areas, according to the  ministry ’s 2011 policy report to
President  Lee Myung Bak  yesterday.  “Investors are betting on the government’s will to boost
the construction sector next year,” said  Park Young Do , an
analyst at LIG Investment & Securities Co. “The government
appears to view support measures for the industry are needed to
achieve its growth target.”  South Korea’s  gross domestic product  is likely to expand
4.5 percent in 2011, compared with 6.1 percent this year, the
central bank forecast on Dec. 10.  Hyundai Development Co. climbed 1.7 percent to 33,350 won
and  Daelim Industrial Co.  added 5 percent to 115,500 won.  Daewoo
Engineering & Construction Co. , which said it received an order
worth 1.19 trillion won to build a thermal power plant in
Morocco, gained 5 percent to 12,550 won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
