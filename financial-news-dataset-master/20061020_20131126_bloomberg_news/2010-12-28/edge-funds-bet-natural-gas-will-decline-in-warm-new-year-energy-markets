Hedge funds raised bearish natural
gas bets by the most since October on forecasts that higher-
than-normal temperatures in the first weeks of the New Year will
reduce demand for the heating fuel.  The funds and other large speculators cut  net-long 
positions, or wagers on rising prices, by 35 percent in the
seven days ended Dec. 21, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments of Traders report. It
was the largest drop since Oct. 12.  Natural gas has declined 24 percent this year as  stockpiles 
reached record levels for the second straight November. Warmer-
than-normal weather forecast for early next month may reduce the
demand needed to erode surplus inventories.  “The first two weeks of January, you’re going to see the
market turn around from December cold,” said  Dave Melita ,
president and chief meteorologist of Melita Weather Associates
in Durango, Colorado. “The snow cover will be melting fast. It
will be 20 degrees above average on some days.”  Temperatures in Chicago will dip to a low of 19 degrees
Fahrenheit (7 Celsius) on Jan. 1, 2 degrees above normal and 14
degrees higher than a year earlier, according to  AccuWeather 
Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. New York will fall to 38
degrees, 10 above average. About 52 percent of U.S. households
use natural gas for heat.  Natural gas for January delivery advanced 10.4 cents, or
2.5 percent, to settle at $4.216 per million British thermal
units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract expired
today. Gas for February delivery rose 13.3 cents to $4.288.
Heating demand drove gas prices above $6 last January.  ‘Blowtorch Hot’  Higher-than-average temperatures will persist throughout
the Midwest and eastern U.S., with potential in February for
“blowtorch hot” weather compared with seasonal norms, Melita
said.  The Energy Department reported last week that inventories
declined by 184 billion cubic feet in the week ended Dec. 17 to
3.368 trillion cubic feet. Stockpiles reached a record 3.84
trillion the week ended Nov. 5.  Gas stockpiles will total 1.833 trillion cubic feet at the
end of the winter heating season in March, about 171 billion
cubic feet higher than at the end of March 2010, the Energy
Department said Dec. 7 in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  U.S. natural gas production may reach a record high of
62.09 billion cubic feet a day this year, the department said.  “It’s a pretty bearish picture weather wise, and we’re
really not seeing a decline in production,” said  Hamza Khan , an
analyst with the Schork Group Inc., a consulting company in
Villanova, Pennsylvania.  Price Drop  If natural gas falls below price support at $3.60 per
million Btu, “it’s hard to call a bottom,” Khan said. Prices
closed at a 2010 low of $3.292 on Oct. 27.  Net-long  positions in natural gas held by managed money,
including hedge funds, commodity pools and commodity-trading
advisers, in futures and options combined in four natural-gas
contracts declined by 37,324.8 futures equivalents to 70,294 in
the week ended Dec. 21.  The measure of net longs includes an index of four
contracts adjusted to futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas
futures, Nymex Henry Hub Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate
Swaps and ICE Henry Hub Swaps. Henry Hub, in Erath, Louisiana,
is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark price for
the fuel.  In other markets,  net-long  positions in oil increased by
1,578 futures and options combined, or 0.8 percent, to 207,468,
according to the CFTC report.  Oil Jumps  Oil has risen 15 percent this year on speculation the
global economic rebound will boost fuel consumption and erode
stockpiles. The International Energy Agency, in its monthly
report Dec. 10, upgraded its demand forecast for next year,
citing gains in North America and China.  Crude inventories  reached a 2010 peak the week ended Oct.
29, declining 7.5 percent since then to 340.7 million barrels in
the week ended Dec. 17, the lowest level since February, the
Energy Department reported last week. Oil rose 12 percent in
that time.  Bullish, or long, bets on  gasoline  prices rose 3.2 percent
to 69,113 futures and options combined, the CFTC data showed.
Net-long bets on  heating oil  rose by 3.6 percent to 37,902.  To contact the reporter on this story:
