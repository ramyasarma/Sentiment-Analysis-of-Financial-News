Somali pirates released the German-
owned Marida Marguerite that had been seized on May 8, the
European Union Naval Force said.  There are now 25 vessels and 587 hostages being held by
pirates off the coast of Somalia, the force said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Yesterday, a pirate leader said the captors of the 13,000-
ton vessel had been paid a $5.5 million ransom.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
