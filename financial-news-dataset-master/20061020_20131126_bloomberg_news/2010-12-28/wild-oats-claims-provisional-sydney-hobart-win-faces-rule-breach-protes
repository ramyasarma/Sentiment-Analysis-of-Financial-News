Wild Oats XI claimed its fifth line
honors victory from six starts in sailing’s Sydney to Hobart
after surviving a protest.  A five-man international jury today dismissed the protest
lodged by the  race committee , which had alleged Wild Oats XI had
breached the rules by failing to have an operational radio as it
entered Bass Strait.  “Wild Oats XI has been confirmed as line honors winner of
the 2010 Sydney Hobart Yacht Race after the race committee radio
protest was dismissed,” organizers  said  on the race website.  The 100-foot supermaxi, owned by billionaire  Bob Oatley ,
was named as the provisional winner last night after finishing
the 628-nautical mile event in a time of 2 days, 7 hours, 37
minutes and 20 seconds.  Skippered by Mark Richards, Wild Oats XI led the 87-yacht
field out of Sydney Harbour on Dec. 26 and held pole position
for the entire race, finishing 3 1/2 hours ahead of its nearest
rival Investec Loyal. It’s the 66th edition of the race that
takes competitors down Australia’s southeast coast and across
Bass Strait to the island state of Tasmania.  Two years ago, Wild Oats XI became the first boat to beat
the fleet to Hobart four years in a row. It finished as the 2009
runner-up to New Zealand’s Alfa Romeo.  The record for most line honors wins is held by
Morna/Kurrewa IV, which sailed to seven victories under two
different owners and two different names, the last time in 1960
as Kurrewa IV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
