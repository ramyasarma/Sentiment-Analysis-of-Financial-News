Everything Everywhere, a U.K.
mobile-phone joint venture of  France Telecom SA  and  Deutsche
Telekom AG , will retain both its brands, Orange and T-Mobile,
the Financial Times reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer  Tom Alexander .  There has been speculation that Everything Everywhere might
drop the T-Mobile brand, to reduce costs and complexity;
however, Alexander said both brands will probably be retained
for the foreseeable future, the newspaper said.  He said he’s looking at a new charging arrangement for
smartphones, in which customers in cities might have to pay more
than those in rural areas, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
