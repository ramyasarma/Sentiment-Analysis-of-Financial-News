Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
declined 65.03, or 0.3 percent, to 20,448.48 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Milan.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Fiat SpA  (F IM) increased 1.5 percent to 15.22 euros after
dropping 3.4 percent yesterday when automakers were the worst

second time in just over two months. Equita Sim SpA said in a
note that most Italian companies have modest exposure to China.  Exor SpA  (EXO IM), Fiat’s main shareholder, increased 1.1
percent to 24.67 euros.  Tenaris SA  (TEN IM) dropped for a second day, losing 0.9
percent to 18.38 euros. Exane BNP Paribas downgraded the world’s

to “neutral” from “outperform,” citing the stock’s recent
gain.  Tod’s SpA  (TOD IM) sank 2.6 percent to 73.49 euros, a
fourth straight decline, as shares of the luxury-goods maker
