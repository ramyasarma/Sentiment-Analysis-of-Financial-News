Australia reached 95-1 in its second
innings at tea on day three of the fourth Ashes cricket Test in
Melbourne, still needing another 320 runs to make England bat
again after conceding a record first-innings lead.    The home team lost opener Phillip Hughes to a run out in
the afternoon session before  Shane Watson  and  Ricky Ponting 
shared a 42-run partnership. England was earlier dismissed for
513 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as  Jonathan Trott  hit an
unbeaten 168.  Watson, who survived on 43 when an edge fell centimeters
short of wicketkeeper Matt Prior, was 50 not out at the
interval, his fourth half-century of the series, with Australia
captain Ponting on 19.   England’s lead of 415 was an Ashes record margin for a team
batting second in the first innings as the English seek to
retain the trophy with a victory at the MCG. Australia, which
was skittled for 98 on day one, faces the prospect of having to
bat for another seven sessions to avoid defeat and set up a
series decider in Sydney.   The best-of-five contest is tied at 1-1. As Ashes holder,
England would keep the trophy by tying the series. The English
last successfully retained the Ashes in 1986-87, when Mike
Gatting’s team secured a 2-1 win in Australia.  Trott earlier batted through the morning session as England
added 69 runs to its overnight total of 444-5. Australia fast
bowler  Peter Siddle  removed Prior, Tim Bresnan and James
Anderson to finish with 6-75, while Ben Hilfenhaus took the
wickets of Graeme Swann and Chris Tremlett.  Trott batted for 468 minutes, faced 345 balls and struck 14
boundaries in his unbeaten innings, his third highest score in
elite Tests. England’s total was the third time it had amassed
500 runs or more in the current series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
