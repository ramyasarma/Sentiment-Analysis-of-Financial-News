Research In Motion Ltd.  may need to
re-engineer its BlackBerry PlayBook tablet computer, due next
year, to improve its battery life, according to Kaufman Bros.
analyst  Shaw Wu .  Developers who are designing applications for the PlayBook
said the device has a battery life of two to four hours,
compared with as long as 10 hours for  Apple Inc. ’s iPad, Wu said
today in an interview.  RIM , whose BlackBerry smartphones are losing market share
to Apple’s iPhone, is developing the PlayBook to bring in a new
source of revenue and bolster growth. Wu estimated RIM will ship
700,000 PlayBooks next year. Other  analysts  project shipments
ranging between 1 million and 8 million units.  “One possibility we are hearing is the likelihood of a
larger battery which could add to the heft and weight of
PlayBook,” Wu, who is based in San Francisco, wrote today in a
note to clients. “We are not convinced that tablets outside of
the iPad will see high-volume success.”  A voice-mail message left at Waterloo, Ontario-based
Research In Motion wasn’t immediately returned.  RIM fell 45 cents to $58.02 today in Nasdaq Stock Market
 trading . The shares, down 14 percent this year, have jumped 35
percent since the end of August, a few weeks before the company
unveiled the planned tablet.  Wu maintained his “hold”  rating  on RIM shares, saying that
while he believes the company’s valuation is depressed, “the
competitive overhang is unlikely to go away in the near term.”  RIM said on a Dec. 16 conference call it plans to release
the PlayBook in the first calendar quarter of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
