Stocks in Switzerland were little
changed as U.S. retailers’ holiday sales rose the most in five
years, while consumer confidence figures suggested the recovery
in the U.S. and Swiss economies might falter.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. , the 120-year-old private bank,
gained 1.5 percent and  VZ Holding AG , the financial adviser,
surged 8.6 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies rose less than 0.1 percent to 6,569.06 at the
5:30 p.m. close of trading in Zurich. The gauge has increased
0.4 percent this year, trailing the 10 percent increase in the
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The broader  Swiss Performance
Index  also added less than 0.1 percent today to 5,890.85.  “It will be quite random this week with low volumes and
not many people around,” said  Thomas Stucki , chief investment
officer at Hyposwiss Privatbank AG in Zurich. “We will be quite
strong in the first week or two weeks of January then the rally
will lose steam quickly.”  U.S. retailers’ 2010 holiday sales jumped 5.5 percent for
the best performance in five years as shoppers snapped up
clothing and jewelry at Macy’s Inc., Tiffany & Co. and other
stores.  Retail sales, excluding autos, rose to $584 billion from
Nov. 5 through Dec. 24, said MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse,
which measures retail sales by all payment forms. That compared
with a 4.1 percent gain a year earlier.  A separate report showed confidence among U.S. consumers
fell in December, a sign that the biggest part of the economy
will struggle to sustain momentum into 2011, according to a New
York-based research group. The Conference Board’s confidence
index decreased to 52.5, lower than the most pessimistic
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and down from
a revised 54.3 in November.  Julius Baer, VZ  Julius Baer gained 1.5 percent to 44.45 Swiss francs,
erasing yesterday’s loss. The stock has increased 22 percent
this year as the bank boosted client assets under management.  VZ Holding surged 8.6 percent to 119.8 francs, the biggest
gain since August 2009.  Burckhardt Compression Holding AG  added 1 percent to 262.50
francs, the highest price since 2008, after Vontobel AG lifted
its price estimate for the stock 15 percent to 250 francs.  “Going forward, we expect orders from China/India and
Middle East to continue to recover while the U.S. market is set
to remain dull,” wrote  Fabian Haecki , analyst at Vontobel, in a
note to clients.  Loeb Holding AG , the retailer founded by four brothers,
fell 2 percent to 179.8 francs after a Swiss consumer gauge also
retreated in November. UBS AG’s index of consumption, which aims
to predict developments about three months ahead, decreased to
1.63 from a revised 1.71 in October, the Zurich-based bank said
today in an e-mailed statement. The indicator, based on new car
sales, retail sales and other consumer activity is still above
its long-term average of 1.50 points, UBS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
