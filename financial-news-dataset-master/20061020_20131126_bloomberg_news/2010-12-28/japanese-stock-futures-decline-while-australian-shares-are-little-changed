Japanese  stock   futures  fell as the
dollar weakened yesterday to a six-week low against the yen,
damping the outlook for export earnings. Australian shares were
little changed.  American depositary receipts of  Advantest Corp. , the
world’s biggest maker of chip-testing equipment, lost 0.6
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Kyocera
Corp., a Japanese electronics maker that gets more than half of
its sales abroad, declined 0.4 percent. Newcrest Mining Ltd.,
Australia’s largest gold producer, gained 1.2 percent after
prices of the precious metal increased.  In Japan, “stocks, especially exporters, will head lower
because of the yen’s appreciation,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an
equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.
“Money flows into risk assets, including commodities, has
continued, so gains in commodities should support the market.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 10,270 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,310 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,270
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.1 percent.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index rose 0.1 percent yesterday in New York
as commodity producers gained on higher prices for energy and
metals amid signs of growing global demand.  U.S. Confidence  The New York-based Conference Board said yesterday that its
index of U.S.  consumer confidence  decreased to 52.5 in December,
lower than the most pessimistic forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. Separate reports showed a gain in U.S. retail
sales and a drop in property values.  The  yen  appreciated to 81.82 against the dollar yesterday
in New York, the strongest level in intraday trading since Nov.
12. Against the euro, Japan’s currency climbed to 107.62, the
highest since Sept. 14. A stronger yen reduces the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 13 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 13 percent by the S&P
500 and 10 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.8 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 14.8 times for the S&P 500 and 12.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for February delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$91.46 a barrel in New York yesterday. Copper futures climbed
1.1 percent in New York to a record for a second straight day.
Gold futures gained 1.6 percent in New York yesterday, the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since Nov. 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
