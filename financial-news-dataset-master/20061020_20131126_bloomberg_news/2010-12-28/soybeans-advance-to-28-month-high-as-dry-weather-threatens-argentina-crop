Soybeans advanced to a 28-month high
on concern that dry weather in Brazil and Argentina may stress
crops, curbing global supply.  March-delivery soybeans gained as much as 0.5 percent to
$13.9125 a bushel, the highest price for a most-active contract
since Aug. 1, 2008. It traded at $13.9075 a bushel at
8:53 a.m. Manila time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
