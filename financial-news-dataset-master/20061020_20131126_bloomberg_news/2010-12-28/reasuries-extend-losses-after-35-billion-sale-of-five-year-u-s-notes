Treasuries extended advances after
the U.S. sale of $29 billion in seven-year notes attracted
stronger-than-expected demand.  The notes drew a yield of 2.830 percent, compared with the
average forecast of 2.864 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
6 of the 18 primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.86, compared with an average of 2.88
for the past 10 sales.  “We are seeing some window dressing of balance sheets
going into year-end, which should bode well for Treasuries,”
said  Christian Cooper , head of U.S. dollar derivatives trading
in New York at Jefferies Group Inc., before the auction. “Next
week, however, is a whole new ball game.” As a primary dealer,
Jefferies is obligated to participate in U.S. debt sales.  The yield on the current seven-year note decreased 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 2.76 percent at 1:04 p.m.
in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year  note  dropped 8 basis points to 3.40 percent.  U.S. debt has returned 4.9 percent in 2010, more than
erasing last year’s 3.7 percent loss, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index. Investment-grade corporate debt has
returned 8.2 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index has increased 13 percent.  At today’s auction of the December 2017 maturity, indirect
bidders, an investor class that includes foreign central banks,
purchased 64.2 percent of the notes, compared with 42.2 percent
at the Nov. 24 sale and an average of 48.5 percent for the past
10 sales.  Direct Bidders  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 4.6 percent of
the notes, compared with 8.5 percent last month and the 10-sale
average of 10.4 percent.  The 10-year note yield increased 15 basis points yesterday,
the most in two weeks, following the $35 billion five-year note
sale. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.61, the
least since June. Primary dealers ended up buying 58.2 percent
of the offering, the most since July 2009.  Today’s sale was the last of three note auctions this week
totaling $99 billion. Treasuries advanced on Dec. 27, when the
$35 billion sale of two-year notes drew the highest level of
demand in three months.  U.S. government debt maturing in more than a year has
handed investors a loss of 2.7 percent in December, according to
figures compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. That’s the worst monthly
performance among 26 sovereign indexes.  Bond Bears  Bond bears speculate that U.S. economic growth will pick up
in 2011, driven by the Federal Reserve’s second round of
government debt purchases known as quantitative easing, an
extension of tax cuts that President  Barack Obama  signed into
law this month and a widening of deficits.  “QE2 created a small bubble in the economy and the
markets,” said  Kei Katayama , who helps oversee the equivalent
of $55.2 billion as leader of the foreign fixed-income group at
Daiwa Securities Group Inc. in Tokyo. “Stocks and commodities
rose. That pushed yields up in the major markets.” Katayama
said he holds fewer Treasuries than the percentages in the
indexes he uses to gauge performance.  The Federal Reserve bought $5.387 billion of Treasuries
maturing from June 2012 to June 2013 to help lower borrowing
costs and stimulate economic growth.  First-time  filings  for jobless insurance decreased to
415,000 in the week ended Dec. 25, from 420,000 in the previous
week, according to the median forecast of 27 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The report from the Labor Department is
due at 8:30 a.m. New York time tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
