Starbucks Corp.  denied  Kraft Foods
Inc. ’s claim that the foodmaker has performed “exceptionally
well” under an agreement that Kraft claims gives it exclusive
rights to sell Starbucks coffee in grocery stores through 2014.  In papers filed yesterday in federal court in White Plains,
New York, Starbucks denied the central allegations of Kraft’s
Dec. 6 suit and said a judge should deny Kraft’s request for an
order barring Starbucks from terminating the agreement.  “Starbucks avers that it has repeatedly expressed its
dissatisfaction to Kraft regarding Kraft’s performance” under
the agreement, the world’s biggest coffee shop chain said in its
answer to Kraft’s complaint.  Kraft, based in Northfield, Illinois, claims in the suit
that Starbucks is planning to break the agreement and take over
the business of selling its whole bean and ground coffee in
grocery stores.  Kraft claims it will be irreparably damaged if Seattle-
based Starbucks is permitted to end the agreement as planned, on
March 1, before the parties are able to resolve their dispute in
arbitration.  In 12 years, “Kraft has grown the sales of Starbucks
consumer packaged goods products 10-fold, increasing annual
revenue from approximately $50 million to approximately $500
million,” according to its complaint.  The case is Kraft Foods Global Inc. v. Starbucks Corp., 10-
cv-09085, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(White Plains).  To contact the reporters on this story:
