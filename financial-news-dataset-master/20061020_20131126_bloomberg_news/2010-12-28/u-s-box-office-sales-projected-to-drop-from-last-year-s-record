Movie ticket sales will total $10.56
billion in the U.S. and Canada this year, falling short of last
year’s record $10.6 billion as higher ticket prices failed to
counter shrinking attendance.  Attendance is projected to fall 5.4 percent, the biggest
drop since 2005,  Hollywood.com Box-Office  said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Revenue has declined for seven consecutive weeks as holiday
releases, including “Tron: Legacy” and “Little Fockers,”
failed to match 2009 blockbusters such as “Avatar” and “The
Blind Side.” No new movies are scheduled for wide release in
the rest of the year, according to Hollywood.com data.  Walt Disney Co. produced the two top-grossing movies
released this year. “Toy Story 3” led with $415 million in
domestic sales, followed by “Alice in Wonderland” with $334.2
million, according to Box Office Mojo. “Avatar,” which opened
in December 2009, took in $466.1 million this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
