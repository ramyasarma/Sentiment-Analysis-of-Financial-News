Eric Laakso , who played seven
seasons as an offensive lineman for the Miami Dolphins, has died
at the age of 54, the National Football League team said on its
website.  Laakso was found dead of natural causes on Dec. 25,
the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported, citing the Broward
County, Florida, medical examiner’s office.  Laakso was drafted out of Tulane University in 1978 and
played in 86 games for the Dolphins, making 61 starts, including
48 straight. He was a member of both the 1982 and 1984 Dolphins’
teams that reached the Super Bowl, and was named to the All-NFL
first team by the Sporting News in 1983.  “He was an inspirational player who was always viewed as a
team leader,”  Nat Moore , the Dolphins’ vice president/special
adviser who was Laakso’s teammate, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
