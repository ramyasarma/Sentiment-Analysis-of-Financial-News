Wheat futures rose to a three-week
high on signs that demand is increasing for grain from the
U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  Egypt, the world’s biggest importer, agreed to buy 60,000
metric tons of soft-variety U.S. wheat in a tender today, the
country’s General Authority for Supply Commodities said. U.S.
wheat  inspected  for export totaled 17.5 million bushels the
week ended Dec. 23, 53 percent more than a year earlier, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday.  “Weekly sales have been pretty steady,” said  Larry Glenn , an analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter, Kansas. “We’re in
the holiday time period, so you don’t get a lot of stuff
reported, but it’s still been pretty decent.”  Wheat futures for March delivery rose 18 cents, or 2.3
percent, to settle at $7.9825 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $8.02, the
highest since Dec. 7. Futures are up 47 percent this year as
adverse weather cut supplies in Russia and threatened crops in
Australia and the U.S.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
