The ruble gained to its strongest
level in two months against the dollar and is headed for its
best month this year as oil prices near a two-year high and
rising interest rates bolster the currency’s appeal.  Russia’s currency climbed as much as 0.7 percent to 30.15
per dollar today, the strongest intraday level since Oct. 25,
and bound for its highest close since Oct. 14. The ruble, which
was little changed at 34.6667 versus the central bank’s target
 dollar-euro basket  today, has gained 3.1 percent in December
versus the mechanism used to limit swings in the currency that
disadvantage exporters, its biggest monthly advance since
September 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Crude, which along with natural gas makes up about a
quarter of Russia’s economic output, rose as much as 0.4 percent
to $91.34 a barrel in New York today, near its highest in two
years, amid speculation declining U.S. fuel stockpiles will
bolster prices. Bank Rossii lifted the rate charged on ruble
deposits kept with the central bank by 0.25 percentage point to
2.75 percent Dec. 24, amid concern “inflation risks” are
increasing, according to a statement issued after last week’s
monetary policy review.  “Banks are now trying to reduce their foreign-currency
positions and are switching to ruble,”  Anton Nikitin , an
economist at Moscow-based investment bank Renaissance Capital,
said by phone today. “The ruble trend will be determined by the
current-account surplus which is bolstered by higher oil.”  Ruble Depreciates  The ruble snapped a six-day advance, traded 0.3 percent
down at 30.27 per euro as of 12:04 p.m. in Moscow. The basket
rate, which has been in place since 2005, is calculated by
multiplying the dollar-ruble rate by 0.55, the euro-ruble rate
by 0.45, then adding them together. The ruble is little changed
against the dollar in 2010, and gained 7.8 percent versus the
euro, bound for its best year since at least 2004, Bloomberg
data shows.  Ruble trading is subdued because many traders and investors
are on holiday for the western Christmas period, Nikitin said.
Dollar-ruble  trading volumes  on Moscow’s Micex exchange slid to
$2.64 billion yesterday, down from this month’s peak of $4.95
billion on Dec. 9.  Higher interest rates lure investors to the ruble by
bolstering its allure as a carry-trade currency. In carry
trades, funds borrowed in countries such as the U.S. and Japan -
- where rates are near zero -- are invested in places like
Russia or Brazil where the returns are higher. Russia’s
 refinancing rate  is at a record-low 7.75 percent, while Brazil’s
 Selic target rate  has been raised three times this year to 10.75
percent.  Stocks Gain  The  Micex stock index  snapped two days of declines,
climbing 0.1 percent to 1,665.19, with  OAO Lukoil , Russia’s
largest independent oil producer, rising 0.6 percent to 1,746
rubles.  OAO Sberbank , the nation’s biggest lender, fell for a
second day, slipping 0.3 percent to 104.8 rubles.  The ruble will probably continue to strengthen until the
end of the year to around 34 versus the basket, Nikitin said.
Renaissance predicts the ruble will trade 2.6 percent stronger
at 33.80 against the basket by the end of the first quarter of
next year, he said.  Currency and stocks trading on the Micex will be closed
from Dec. 31 to Jan. 10 for the Russian New Year holidays,
Nikita Bekasov, a spokesman for the exchange, said by e-mail
last week.  The ruble, which began trading against the Chinese yuan on
the Micex for the first time on Dec. 15, strengthened for a
fourth day, gaining 0.3 percent to 45.89 per 10 yuan by the end
of the one-hour trading session in Moscow.  Russia’s dollar bonds due April 2020 rose, pushing the
yield down 0.02 percentage point, or 2 basis points, to 5.023
percent. The yield on government ruble bonds maturing March 2016
rose 8 basis points to 7.6 percent today, the biggest advance
since Dec. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
