More U.K. consumers visited stores
yesterday as retailers slashed prices to boost  sales  ahead of an
increase in value-added taxes.  Shopper numbers rose 2.4 percent Dec. 27, compared with
Dec. 28, 2009, the first public holiday after Christmas Day last
year, Jordan Byrnes, a spokesman for market researcher  Experian
Group Ltd. , said today by e-mail. The U.K.’s value-added tax
rate will rise to 20 percent from 17.5 percent on Jan. 4.  Shopper numbers fell 20 percent from a year earlier on
Dec. 26, or “Boxing Day,” as shorter Sunday shopping hours
kept Britons away on what is traditionally considered the
biggest shopping day of the year, Experian said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
