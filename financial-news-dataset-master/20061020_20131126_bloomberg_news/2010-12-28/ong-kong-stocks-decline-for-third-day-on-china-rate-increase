Hong Kong  stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to a three-month low as developers slid after
China raised interest rates for a second time since mid-October,
and the city’s home sales declined. The city’s market was closed
yesterday for a holiday.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., controlled by the
nation’s construction ministry, slid 2.3 percent. Sino Land Co.,
the worst performer in the past month on the Hang Seng Property
Index, lost 3 percent.  PetroChina Co. , the nation’s largest oil
and gas producer, slipped 1.6 percent after agreeing to sell its
stake in a natural-gas pipeline operator to a Hong Kong-listed
subsidiary for 18.9 billion yuan ($2.9 billion).  China’s rate increase “is prompting people to say the
government is moving quickly because of the risk of inflation in
China and that there may be more rises ahead,” said  Andrew Sullivan , director of institutional sales at OSK Securities Hong
Kong Ltd. “The worry is moving from a housing bubble causing
inflation to wider inflation in the system. Much of that is
actually food and fuel over which China has little control.”  The  Hang Seng Index  declined 0.9 percent to 22,621.73, its
lowest close since Oct. 4. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index 
of so-called H shares of Chinese companies dropped 1.1 percent
to 12,309.59.  The Hang Seng Index has gained 3.4 percent this year, after
rallying 52 percent in 2009, on speculation growth in corporate
profits would counter China’s steps to curb property-price
inflation, Europe’s debt crisis, and concern about the pace of
the U.S. economic recovery.  China Resources Land  Shares in the gauge trade at an average 14.2 times
estimated earnings, compared with 17.2 times at the beginning of
this year.  China Overseas Land slid 2.3 percent to HK$14.18. China
Resources Land Ltd., a state-controlled developer, fell 1.7
percent to HK$13.88.  China’s central bank said on Dec. 25 it would raise its
benchmark  one-year lending rate  by 25 basis points to 5.81
percent, and the one-year deposit rate the same amount to 2.75
percent. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News earlier this
month forecast one percentage point of increases by the end of
2011.  The People’s Bank of China has ordered banks to set aside
more reserves six times this year, including three times since
November, after the nation reported inflation of 5.1 percent
last month, the highest in 28 months, with food costs climbing
11.7 percent.  China Retailers Decline  Mainland retailers also declined on concern tightening
policies will slow economic growth and consumption.  Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Ltd. , China’s second-
biggest electronics retailer, dropped 5.2 percent to HK$2.72.
Belle International Holdings Ltd., China’s largest retailer of
women’s shoes, fell 3.8 percent to HK$12.78. China Resources
Enterprise Ltd., the Chinese government-backed partner of
SABMiller Plc, slid 3.3 percent to HK$30.60.  Sino Land lost 3 percent to HK$14.28. New World Development
Co., controlled by billionaire Cheng Yu-tung, declined 2.7
percent to HK$14.18.  Hang Lung Properties Ltd. , Hong Kong’s No.
3 developer by market value, slid 2.5 percent to HK$35.45.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. , the city’s biggest developer
by market value, retreated 0.9 percent to HK$127.50.  Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Ltd. , the No. 2, declined 1.4 percent to HK$118.30.  Home Sales Slide  The Hang Seng Property Index’s 1.6 percent drop was the
biggest among the four industry groups tracked by the Hang Seng
Index.  Hong Kong existing-home sales over the three-day holiday
weekend fell 0.7 percent from the previous week on a daily
average basis, Midland Holdings Ltd. said.  Any additional measures by Hong Kong’s government to cool
house-price gains would run the risk of crimping demand among
“real buyers” as well as speculators, said  Mark McCombe , chief
executive officer of HSBC Holdings Plc’s Hong Kong unit.  PetroChina slipped 1.6 percent to HK$9.77.  Kunlun Energy Co. 
is in the course to finalize an agreement to acquire a 60
percent stake in PetroChina Beijing Natural Gas Pipeline Co.,
according to a statement. Kunlun Energy dropped 3.4 percent to
HK$12. PetroChina owns 50.75 percent of the company, formerly
known as CNPC Hong Kong Ltd.  Macau Investment  Macau Investment Holdings Ltd. , which offers property and
financial investment services, lost 5.4 percent to HK$2.80 after
saying East Asia Sentinel Ltd. has resigned as the company’s
auditor, effective Dec. 24, owing to a dispute over audit fees.  Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s biggest gold miner, slid
2.4 percent to HK$6.84. The Chinese province of Fujian fined
Zijin officials a combined 1.16 million yuan for waste spills in
July, according to a statement.  In a separate statement, Zijin said it agreed to sell the
assets and mining rights at its Yinyan tin mine in the southern
province of Guangdong to cover costs related to the deadly
collapse of a dam at the site in September.  Chu Kong Petroleum & Natural Gas Steel Pipe Holdings Ltd. ,
which produces steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, plunged
9.1 percent to HK$3.21 after saying it may record a
“substantial” decrease in full-year profit.  China Construction Bank Corp. dropped 1.5 percent to
HK$6.68. The company tied up with Taiwan’s China Life Insurance
Co. to invest in Pacific Antai Life Insurance Co. China’s
second-largest bank said it bought 1 percent of Shanghai-based
Pacific Antai, boosting its stake to 51 percent.  All but four stocks fell among the 45 constituents of the
Hang Seng Index. Its futures slid 0.7 percent to 22,634.  To contact the reporter on this story:
