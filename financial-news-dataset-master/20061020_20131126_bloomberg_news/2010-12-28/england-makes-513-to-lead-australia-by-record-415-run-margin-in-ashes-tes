Jonathan Trott  hit 168 not out to
lift England to a 415-run first-innings lead over Australia at
lunch on day three of the fourth Ashes Test at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground.  Trott batted through the morning session as England was
dismissed for 513 after resuming at 444-5. Australia fast bowler
 Peter Siddle  removed Matt Prior, Tim Bresnan and James Anderson
to finish with 6-75, while Ben Hilfenhaus took the wickets of
Graeme Swann and Chris Tremlett.  The lead of 415 runs is an Ashes record margin for a team
batting second as England seeks to retain the trophy with a
victory at the MCG. Australia, which was skittled for 98 on day
one, faces the prospect of having to bat for eight sessions to
avoid defeat and take the series into a deciding match in
Sydney.   The best-of-five contest is tied at 1-1. As Ashes holder,
England would keep the trophy by tying the series. The English
last successfully retained the Ashes in 1986-87, when Mike
Gatting’s team secured a 2-1 win in Australia.  England added 15 runs to its overnight score before Prior
chipped a Siddle delivery to  Ricky Ponting when on 85. Siddle
then had Tim Bresnan caught behind for 4 and Hilfenhaus removed
Swann in similar style for 22 before clean bowling Tremlett.  Siddle, who also took two catches off Mitchell Johnson’s
bowling yesterday, wrapped up the innings by knocking over
Anderson’s stumps.   Trott batted for 468 minutes, faced 345 balls and struck 14
boundaries in his unbeaten innings, his third highest score in
elite Tests. England’s total was the third time it had amassed
500 runs or more in the current series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
