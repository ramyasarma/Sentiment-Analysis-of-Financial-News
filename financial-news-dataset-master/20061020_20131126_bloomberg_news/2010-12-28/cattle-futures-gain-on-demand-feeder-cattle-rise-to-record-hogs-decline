Hog futures fell from a four-month
high after a government report showed pig litters at record
highs, buoying supplies even as farmers cut herds. Cattle also
dropped.  The hog-breeding herd was 1.2 percent smaller on Dec. 1
than a year earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
yesterday after livestock markets closed in Chicago. Each sow
that farrowed during the quarter ended Nov. 30 produced an
average 9.89 pigs per litter, a record, as farmers culled less
efficient animals.  “The breeding herd was smaller, but again we had more pigs
per litter, so that’s keeping our hog numbers fairly stable,”
said  Lawrence Kane , a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group
in Yates City, Illinois. “It seems like every time we cut sows
by 1 percent, the pigs per litter go up by 2 percent.”  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.225 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at 78.625 cents a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Yesterday, the price reached 79.2
cents, the highest since Aug. 19. The commodity is up 20 percent
this year.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.15 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $1.078 a pound, the first decline in seven sessions.
Futures are up 25 percent this year, heading for the biggest
annual gain since 1978.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement dropped 0.225
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.2345 a pound. Earlier, the price
reached $1.243, the highest since the commodity started trading
on Nov. 30, 1971.  Demand May Slump  Futures fell on speculation that meatpacker demand will
shrink because gains for spot-market cattle have outpaced
wholesale beef prices, said  Troy Vetterkind , the owner of
Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in Chicago. Packers may be losing up
to $30 per head of cattle slaughtered, Vetterkind said.  Wholesale  choice beef  advanced 0.6 percent at midday to
$1.6126 a pound, after dropping 1.7 percent last week, USDA data
show. Spot-market  steer  prices rose 2.8 percent last week from a
week earlier, according to the USDA.  Cattle prices are “way too overvalued,” Vetterkind said.
“Domestic beef demand is just fair at best right now. Export
demand has been the main supportive factor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
