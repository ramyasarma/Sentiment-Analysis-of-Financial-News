The Chinese province of Fujian fined
Zijin Mining Group Co. Chairman Chen Jinghe and Vice President
Zou Laichang a combined 1.16 million yuan for waste spills in
July, according to a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.  Chen was fined 705,997 yuan ($106,566) and Zou 449,768 yuan
for the two leaks of acid copper solution at the Zijinshan Gold
and Copper Mine on July 3 and July 16, according to the
 statement .  The direct economic loss from the spills totaled 31.9
million yuan, said today’s statement. The company said earlier
the July accidents, among the industry’s worst, polluted the
Ting River in Fujian province and poisoned enough fish to feed
72,000 residents for a year.  Zijin  shares declined as much as 2.9 percent to HK$6.81,
the lowest in more than two months, and traded at HK$6.86 in
Hong Kong as of 12:19 p.m. The shares fell 2.3 percent to 7.63
yuan at the midday break in Shanghai trading. The Shanghai
shares have fallen 20 percent in the last 12 months, while the
Hong Kong shares are down 11 percent.  The police detained the Zijinshan copper plant’s manager,
deputy manager and the head of environment during the
investigation after the company waited nine days before
revealing the spill.  In a separate statement, the company said it agreed to sell
the assets and mining rights at its Yinyan tin mine in the
southern province of Guangdong to cover costs related to the
deadly collapse of a dam at the site in September.  Altogether 28 people were declared dead or missing in the
disaster, said Tang Hao, a spokesman of the Guangdong provincial
government, according to a transcript on the website of Nanfang
Daily, a government-sponsored newspaper.  Zijin reported four deaths citing information from county-
level officials. It’s unclear if the other casualties cited by
Tang are directly related to the dam collapse, Company Secretary
Zheng Yuqiang said on Sept. 27.  While the dam collapsed in rainfall generated by a typhoon
occurring only once in more than 200 years, the subsidiary
operating the mine Xinyi Zijin is mainly responsible for the
incident, according to the statement, citing an investigation
team.  -- Helen Sun , with assistance from John Liu. Editors: Peter
