New Jersey Transit said most of the
agency’s services will resume normal operations tomorrow. Trains
will be on a regular weekday schedule with about 1 percent of
the schedule cancelled, the agency said in an e-mailed
statement.  Rail service has been operating on an “enhanced weekend
schedule” yesterday and today, with about 40 percent fewer
trains than a typical weekday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
