Oil traded near a 26-month high in
New York as speculation stockpiles in the U.S. are shrinking
countered concern that the economic recovery in the world’s
biggest crude user may falter.  Crude inventories probably shrank for a fourth week,
extending the longest decline in a year, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before an Energy Department report
tomorrow. Futures earlier dropped as much as 0.3 percent after
data yesterday showed a loss in U.S. consumer confidence and
home values fell more than economists projected.  “Jobs are hard to come by and the value of the single
largest investment for most consumers continues to decline,”
 Stephen Schork , president of The Schork Group Inc., a consultant
in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said in a note today. “When you
toss in the potential for $100 crude oil in 2011, we wonder why
confidence is as high as it is.”  Crude for February delivery was at $91.41 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 8
cents, at 3 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, it rose 0.5 percent
to settle at $91.49. The contract traded at $91.88 on Dec. 27,
the highest since Oct. 7, 2008.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values fell 0.8
percent in October from the same month in 2009, the group said
yesterday. Separately, the New York-based Conference Board’s
confidence index dropped to 52.5, lower than the most
pessimistic forecast of 61 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  “Consumers are clearly still anxious about the future,”
said  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover Inc., an energy
adviser in New Canaan, Connecticut. “Expectations had been for
an improvement to 56, so the figure was not helpful.”  Crude Supplies  Oil, which rallied 78 percent in 2009, has advanced 15
percent this year as a sustained decline in supplies bolstered
speculation fuel demand is recovering.  U.S. crude inventories  probably dropped  2.85 million
barrels from 340.7 million in the week ended Dec. 24, according
to the median estimate of 12 analysts polled by Bloomberg News.
Supplies have decreased this month by 19 million barrels, or 5.3
percent, the most since December 2006.  Gasoline stockpiles  increased 1.63 million barrels from
217.2 million, the survey showed. Distillate fuel inventories,
including heating oil and diesel, probably fell 875,000 barrels
from 160.7 million.  The Energy Department will release its weekly report at 11
a.m. tomorrow in Washington, a day later than usual because of
Christmas. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute,
which collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis, will
issue its report today, also a day later than usual.  Brent crude for February settlement traded at $94.30 a
barrel, down 8 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Yesterday, the contract rose 53 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $94.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
