Hedge funds have become more
optimistic about U.S. stocks, with the percentage of managers
saying they’re upbeat rising to the highest level in at least
seven months, according to  TrimTabs Investment Research  and
BarclayHedge Ltd.  About 46 percent of the 92 hedge-fund managers surveyed in
the past week were bullish on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ,
compared with 31 percent in November, the firms said today in a
report. The share of managers who said they were pessimistic
about U.S. stocks fell to 19 percent from 39 percent, and both
readings were the most extreme for the survey that began in May.  “An inflationary growth consensus has emerged heading into
2011,” said  Vincent Deluard , global equity strategist in New
York for Sausalito, California-based TrimTabs. “Managers are
betting aggressively on the economic recovery.”  The funds, with worldwide assets of about $1.8 trillion,
gained an average of 5 percent this year through November,
according to Bloomberg’s aggregate  index , compared with a 7.9
percent rally in the S&P 500, including dividends.  A majority of managers said precious metals were the most
“overbought” asset, meaning they could be poised for a
decline, according to the report. Gold is headed for its 10th
straight annual gain as governments keep borrowing costs low to
revive their economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
