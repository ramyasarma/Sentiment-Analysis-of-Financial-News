Gold may climb as high as $1,630 an
ounce next year as investors seek protection from financial
turmoil in Europe and the U.S. and as Chinese demand rises,
according to Tom Kendall, the most accurate forecaster for 2010.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows gold’s 26 percent gain this year
and the Dec. 7 record of $1,431.25 an ounce. The metal may climb
as much as 18 percent in 2011, said  Kendall , an analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG in London. In this year’s London Bullion
Market Association survey, Kendall predicted this year’s high
within 0.1 percent. The red line shows the median forecast of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for next year’s average price,
currently $1,400.  “We’re still in an era of unusual financial market
instability and stress,” said Kendall, who was at Mitsubishi
Corp. (U.K.) Plc when he made his gold forecast for the LBMA.
“We’re going to stay with very low to negative interest rates
in real terms and that’s also very supportive for gold.”  In China “there’s increasing imports of gold and a real
boom in retail investment in physical gold there,” Kendall
said. “Inflation is definitely playing into the market” in
China, he said.  The LBMA gives a one-ounce bar of gold to the most accurate
forecaster of average prices, not the year’s high. On that
basis,  Philip Aubertin  of UBS AG would win. He declined to give
a forecast for 2011 because analyst Edel Tully will provide the
LBMA with the bank’s outlook for next year, he said.  (To save a copy of this chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story
