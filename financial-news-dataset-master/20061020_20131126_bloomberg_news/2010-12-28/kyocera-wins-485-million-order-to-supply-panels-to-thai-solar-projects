Kyocera Corp.  of Japan will provide
1 million solar panels to Thailand’s Solar Power Holdings Co., a
company official said today.  The Kyoto-based company will supply the solar panels for 34
locations in Thailand with a total capacity of 204 megawatts,
Sanae Iwasaki, a Kyocera spokeswoman, said by phone. The company
will deliver the panels within four years, she said.  The order is valued at as much as 40 billion ($485
million),  the  Nikkei  newspaper reported earlier. Iwasaki
declined to comment on the value or when the company won the
order.  Construction at three locations, each expected to generate
6 megawatts of power, has started, Iwasaki said.  Editors: Aaron Sheldrick,  To contact the reporters on this story:
