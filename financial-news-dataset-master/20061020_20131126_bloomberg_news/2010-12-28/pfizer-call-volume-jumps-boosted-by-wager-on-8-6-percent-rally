Pfizer Inc.  call-options volume
jumped to almost triple the four-week average, with the most
trading  concentrated  in bets that the world’s largest drugmaker
will rally 8 percent by April.  Almost 147,000 calls to buy Pfizer stock changed hands, the
most in seven weeks and eight times the number of puts to sell,
as of 4 p.m. in New York. The shares climbed 0.6 percent to
$17.59. Almost half of today’s volume was in two block trades of
the April $19 calls, which rose 50 percent to 30 cents for the
second-biggest gain among all of the drugmaker’s options.  “It’s a straight-up directional trade,” said  Steven Williams , an options strategist at Louis Capital Markets LP in
New York. “With the recent bump in Pfizer’s dividend, this is
likely a bet that it will catch up to the broader market. It’s
the first big trade I’ve seen in the last few weeks where people
are going after yield stocks like this, and its likely to be a
precursor to more.”  Pfizer said Dec. 13 that it will raise its  quarterly
dividend  2 cents to 20 cents a share, after cutting the payout
last year to help fund its $68 billion Wyeth acquisition. The
New York-based company also named  George Lorch  board chairman,
replacing  Jeffrey Kindler , who resigned from his positions as
chairman and chief executive officer on Dec. 5.  The drugmaker is down 3.3 percent this year,  lagging  the
1.1 percent advance for health stocks in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and the 13 percent rally for the benchmark itself.  The April $19 calls had an open interest of 572 existing
contracts before today, which indicates that buyers of new
positions initiated almost all of the transactions in that
contract. The shares must rally 8 percent by expiration on April
15 to reach the strike price. Pfizer hasn’t closed above $19
since February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
