Japanese  stocks  fell as concern
China’s interest rate increase will slow growth dragged down
commodity prices and after the yen advanced, damping the outlook
for export earnings. Trading was the lightest in two years.  Inpex Corp., Japan’s No. 1 oil explorer, retreated 1.7
percent. Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s largest commodities trader,
sank 0.6 percent. Tokyo Electron Ltd., a maker of semiconductor
equipment that derives more than 60 percent of its revenue
abroad, retreated 1 percent.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. ,
Japan’s third-largest bank by market value, climbed 1.3 percent
after its chief executive officer said the lender will exceed
capital requirements.  “The market has started to price in further Chinese
increases in interest rates, but incremental increases wouldn’t
be enough to curb its inflation,” said  Hiroshi Fujimoto , a fund
manager at Shinkin Asset. Exporters are falling on “concerns
profits will drop because of a stronger yen.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 0.6 percent to
10,292.63 at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index slid
0.2 percent to 902.83, after rising 0.1 percent. About the same
number of stocks retreated as declined. The  number of shares 
traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section was 1.08
billion, the fewest since Dec. 30, 2008.  The  Topix  has lost 0.5 percent in 2010, compared with gains
of 13 percent by the S&P 500 and 10 percent by the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at 15.7
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 14.7 times
for the S&P 500 and 12.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  China Shares  China increased the key one-year lending and deposit rates
by 25 basis points on Dec. 25. It was the second such increase
since mid-October.  The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
the country’s stock exchanges fell 1.7 percent today, extending
yesterday’s 1.9 percent decline.  “Japanese stocks are falling following declines in Chinese
stocks yesterday afternoon,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior
strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion. “If other emerging countries also
take monetary tightening measures, that will affect the market
psychologically.”  Inpex retreated 1.7 percent to 482,000 yen.  Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. , the nation’s second-biggest oil driller,
dropped 1 percent to 3,075 yen. Mitsubishi sank 0.6 percent to
2,210 yen.  Crude Oil Drops  Crude oil for February delivery fell 0.6 percent to settle
at $91 a barrel in New York yesterday. The  Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index , which tracks prices of 19
commodities from copper to corn, dropped 0.1 percent yesterday
in New York.  Tokyo Electron retreated 1 percent to 5,170 yen. Honda
Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest carmaker, lost 0.7 percent to
3,260 yen. Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s third-biggest automaker by
sales, dropped 1.3 percent to 781 yen.  Kyocera Corp. , an
electronics maker that gets more than half of its revenue
outside Japan, fell 0.7 percent to 8,360 yen.  The yen appreciated to 82.42 against the dollar from 82.75
when the market opened, the strongest level in intraday trading
since Dec. 7. A stronger yen reduces income at Japanese
companies when overseas revenue is converted into their home
currency.  Banks Advance  Mizuho climbed 1.3 percent to 155 yen and was the biggest
support for the Topix.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. ,
Japan’s largest bank by market value, advanced 0.5 percent to
443 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., the second-
biggest bank, rose 0.5 percent to 2,914 yen.  Mizuho’s chief executive officer said the bank expects to
exceed international capital requirements without additional
stock offerings.  Banks also gained after Japan’s  factory output  climbed 1
percent from October, when it dropped 2 percent, the Trade
Ministry said in Tokyo today. The median estimate of 29
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 0.9 percent gain.  Japan’s statistics bureau announced the nation’s
unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.1 percent and consumer
prices fell 0.5 percent in November.  “It’s important to keep taking appropriate measures to
combat deflation in order to attract investment to Japan,”
Daiwa Asset Management’s Nagano said.  Advantest Corp. , the world’s biggest maker of machines used
to test memory chips, slumped 1.6 percent to 1,850 yen on a
Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst report.  “Demand for testers used for dynamic random-access
memories is stagnant due to falling DRAM prices and production
cutbacks by manufacturers,”  Tetsuya Wadaki , an analyst at
Nomura Holdings, wrote in a Japanese-language report dated
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
