Treasuries fell, extending the
world’s steepest bond losses this month, as economists said a
report today will show U.S. consumer confidence is rising.  U.S. debt snapped a gain from yesterday as the government
prepared to sell $35 billion of five-year notes today and $29
billion of seven-year securities tomorrow. A separate report
will show property  values  fell, a sign that housing is a weak
spot in the expansion, based on Bloomberg News surveys of
economists.  “There is still upward pressure on yields,” said
 Chungkeun Oh , a fixed-income trader in Seoul at Industrial Bank
of Korea, South Korea’s largest lender to small- and mid-sized
companies. “The U.S. economy is doing pretty well.” Oh said he
is paying fixed rates and receiving floating in the swaps market
to protect his holdings in case yields climb.  U.S. 10-year yields increased two basis points to 3.35
percent as of 10:10 a.m. in Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market
Data. The price of the 2.625 percent security maturing in
November 2020 declined 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount, to
93 30/32.  Treasuries maturing in 10 years and longer handed investors
a 5.2 percent loss in December, the most of 174 bond indexes
around the world, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
