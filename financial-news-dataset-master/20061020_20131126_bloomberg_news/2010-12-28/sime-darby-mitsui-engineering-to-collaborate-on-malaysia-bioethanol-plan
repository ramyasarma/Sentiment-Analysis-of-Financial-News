Sime Darby Plantation Sdn., a unit
of Malaysia’s  Sime Darby Bhd. , said it is collaborating with
 Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co.  to “construct and
operate” a bioethanol demonstration plant in the Malaysian
state of Selangor.  The plant, which will convert empty oil palm fruit bunches
into bioethanol, will have a processing capacity of 1.25 metric
tons per day, Sime Darby said in an e-mailed statement today.
The plant will collect operational data and confirm the
technical feasibility of commercial-scale production of
bioethanol from this source, the statement said.  “The empty fruit bunch can now move further up the value
chain as a source of biofuel,” Franki Anthony Dass, executive
vice-president of Sime Darby Plantations, said in the statement.
“Successful commercialization will also help in managing solid
waste produced in oil palm estates.”  The production of biofuel from non-food feedstock such as
empty fruit bunches and other palm oil biomass will help to
partially meet the global fuel demand without jeopardizing food
supply, according to the statement.  Test production of bioethanol at the plant will start next
year and the product will be sold in Malaysia as a raw material
for plastics, and later possibly exported to Japan, the Nikkei
newspaper reported earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
