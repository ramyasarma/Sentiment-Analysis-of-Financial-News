What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade as dry weather threatens yields in
Argentina, said  Doug Bergman , a grain broker at Advantage
Traders Group in Chicago. Soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $3
higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open
steady to up 0.1 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on supply concerns in Argentina, Bergman said.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as global supplies of high-quality grain trail
demand following adverse weather in Russia, Ukraine, Canada and
Australia, Bergman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
