Long Island Rail Road said in an e-
mailed statement that it expects “near-normal” service during
the rush hour tomorrow morning.  New Jersey Transit separately said most of the agency’s
services will resume normal operations tomorrow. Trains
will be on a regular weekday schedule with about 1 percent of
the schedule cancelled, New Jersey Transit said in an e-mailed
statement.  Commuter travel in the region this week has been disrupted
by New York City’s heaviest December snowfall in six decades.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
