OAO Inter RAO UES  is in talks with
 E.ON AG , RWE AG and  Enel SpA  on possible asset swaps or
acquisitions in Europe as the Russian state-controlled power
trader seeks to expand abroad, a company official said.  Inter RAO is close to a agreement to buy for cash the
Mariza power plant in Bulgaria from Enel, Italy’s largest
utility, and may announce the outcome at the end of January,
Ilnar Mirsiyapov, head of the company’s strategy and investment
department and management board member, said today at a briefing
in Moscow.  Inter RAO is also seeking to swap its blocking stake in OAO
OGK-5, which is controlled by Enel, for European assets, he
said, adding that there haven’t been any firm offers yet.  Enel isn’t interested in an asset swap, a spokeswoman for
the Italian company, who asked not to be identified, said today
in an e-mailed response to questions. Enel Chief Executive
Officer  Fulvio Conti  said in an interview this month that the
company hopes to sell its Bulgarian power assets in January,
while crediting the sale in its 2010 accounts.  Inter RAO may use its stake in the E.ON-controlled OAO OGK-
4 utility to acquire a power station in Germany and is in talks
with RWE on a Dutch power plant, Mirsiyapov said. Both projects
are in the final stages of construction, and detailed talks will
be held next year, he said.  Mirko Kahre, a spokesman for E.ON in Dusseldorf, and  Annett Urbaczka , an RWE spokeswoman in Essen, both declined to comment.  Inter RAO will hold 26.43 percent of OGK-5 and 3.24 percent
of OGK-4 after it completes consolidation through a share issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
