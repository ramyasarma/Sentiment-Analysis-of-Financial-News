The New Orleans Saints beat the
Atlanta Falcons 17-14 at the Georgia Dome to clinch a spot in
the National Football League playoffs.   Drew Brees threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Jimmy Graham
with 3:28 remaining as the Saints ended Atlanta’s NFL-best
eight-game win streak and prevented the Falcons from capturing
the National Football Conference’s South Division title.   The defending Super Bowl-champion Saints improved to 11-4
and remain in contention for the NFC South title and home-field
advantage in the playoffs, trailing the Falcons (12-3) by one
game with one week left in the regular season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
