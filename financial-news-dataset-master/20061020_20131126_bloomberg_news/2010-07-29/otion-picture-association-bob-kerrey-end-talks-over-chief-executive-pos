             The  Motion Picture Association of
America  said it will continue to search for a new chief
executive officer after ending discussions with former U.S.
Senator  Bob Kerrey .  
 The MPAA, the lobbyist for the largest Hollywood studios,
and Kerrey agreed to end talks about the job vacated by former
Senator  Dan Glickman  in April, the Washington-based association
said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 Kerrey, president of the New School University in New York,
had been in discussions about the job for several months, the
New York Times reported today.  Bob Pisano , the association’s
president, has been acting chief executive since Glickman left.  
 The MPAA represents  Walt Disney Co. , Viacom Inc.’s
Paramount Pictures,  Sony Corp. , News Corp., NBC Universal and
 Time Warner Inc.’s  Warner Bros., according to the association’s
Web site.  
 Kerry served as senator from Nebraska from 1989 to 2000.
Prior to that, he was governor of the state.
