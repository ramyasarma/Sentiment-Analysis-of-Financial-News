             Bank of Japan board members battled
in the months before ending their zero interest-rate stance in
August 2000, a move they revoked seven months later.  
 “It’s not desirable to prolong the half-dead monetary
policy and I hope to normalize it when possible,” then-Governor
 Masaru Hayami  said at a June 28 meeting, according to
transcripts of meetings from the first half of 2000 released in
Tokyo today. Six months earlier, board member  Kazuo Ueda  said
“we all could lose our jobs if a rate increase fails.”  
 The central bank was compelled to cut the  rate  back to zero
and begin flooding the economy with cash in March 2001 as the
global technology boom  collapsed  and sent Japan into a  recession .
The government opposed the rate increase and urged the BOJ to
help repair the economy, applying pressure that still influences
central bank decisions today, said economist  Yoshimasa Maruyama .  
 “The rate hike of 2000 was obviously a policy mistake,
based on an incorrect assessment of the economy,” said Maruyama,
a senior economist at Itochu Corp. in Tokyo. “The incident has
made it hard for BOJ officials to shrug off political pressure
and argue that their judgment is correct.”  
 The central bank retained the policy for five years until
2006, eventually raising the rate to 0.5 percent by February
2007 before lowering it to the current 0.1 percent in December
2008 during the  global financial crisis . Japan still endures
deflation today and the bank has promised to keep a “very
accommodative” policy to eradicate falling prices.  
 Governor Hayami said in March 2000 that the U.S. stock
rally was a “bubble” because successive  rate increases  by the
Federal Reserve didn’t stop its surge, according to the record.
Board member  Nobuyuki Nakahara , who with Ueda voted against the
August rate increase, told a June 12 meeting that he expected
U.S. stocks to plunge and Japan could slip into a recession
later in the year, the transcript shows.
