             Investors should buy bearish Lexmark
International Inc.  options  because the second-largest U.S.
printer maker may pare this year’s 42 percent  gain  as earnings
growth slows and competition increases, Morgan Stanley said.  
 Equity derivatives strategists  Christopher Metli  and  Sivan Mahadevan  recommended buying September $36 puts while selling
September $32 puts, a strategy known as a put spread that cuts
the cost of the trade while capping potential profit. Lexmark
slipped 1.1 percent to $36.60 at 12:55 p.m. New York time. The
shares ended 2009 at $25.98.  
 The New York-based strategists cited Morgan Stanley
industry analyst  Katy Huberty , who lowered her rating on the
shares to “underweight” on July 14. She cited increased
competition with Hewlett-Packard Co. in the laser printer market
and less printer inventory restocking by customers. That means
last quarter’s better-than-expected earnings aren’t sustainable,
Morgan Stanley said.  
 Lexmark, based in Lexington, Kentucky, rose the most in
more than  five months  on July 27 after posting revenue and
profit that beat analysts’ estimates on improving equipment and
services sales. Second-quarter profit excluding some items was
$1.23, exceeding the 93-cent average of analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.
