             Federal prosecutors told a judge
they’ve had “conversations” to resolve criminal cases against
defendants charged in an alleged insider-trading ring led by
former Galleon Group LLC trader  Zvi Goffer .  
 In a declaration filed in federal court in Manhattan this
month, Assistant U.S. Attorney  Reed Brodsky  cited his office’s
“conversations with counsel, including cooperating witnesses
and defendants, regarding dispositions in connection with the
Goffer criminal investigation.”  
 The three-page declaration was filed by Brodsky as part of
an effort to convince a judge that the government’s criminal
prosecution has been distinct from a civil case brought by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Brodsky wrote that the
prosecutors’ talks have been “separate and apart from any
conversations between the staff of the SEC and these
individuals.” Citing Brodsky’s declaration, U.S. District Judge
 Richard Sullivan  in Manhattan today denied a request by the
criminal defendants to obtain documents held by the SEC.  
 Goffer is among seven people indicted in January for
trading on inside tips obtained from lawyers at Ropes & Gray LLP
and elsewhere. One of the seven, David Plate, pleaded guilty on
July 16 and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.  
 JaneAnne Murray and Pery Krinsky, lawyers for defendants
 Craig Drimal  and  Emanuel Goffer , respectively, declined to
comment. Attorneys for other defendants didn’t immediately
returned calls.  
 Wave of Arrests  
 The seven are among 21 people charged in two overlapping
insider trading cases involving Galleon Group founder  Raj Rajaratnam . Twelve have pleaded guilty. Most but not all have
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and testify against others.  
 The first wave of arrests in the case came on Oct. 6, when
Rajaratnam was among six people accused by federal prosecutors.
Four of those have pleaded guilty. Rajaratnam has denied
wrongdoing.  
 Prosecutors launched a second wave of arrests on Nov. 5,
and in January they returned an indictment against Goffer and
the others.  
 The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-56, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
