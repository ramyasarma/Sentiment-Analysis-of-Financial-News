             Suncor Energy Inc ., Canada’s largest
oil company, had a second-quarter profit of C$480 million ($464
million) amid higher crude prices and production from last
year’s takeover of Petro-Canada.  
 Net income was 31 cents a share, compared with a loss of
C$51 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier, Calgary-based Suncor
said in a statement issued today by Marketwire.  
 Excluding gains from asset sales after the Petro-Canada
purchase, Suncor had been expected to earn 35 cents a share, the
average of 17 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The company has been selling C$2.4 billion worth of “non-
core” assets after its Petro-Canada purchase. It agreed last
month to sell fields in the North Sea to Dana Petroleum Plc for
$400 million. It also reached an agreement to sell some natural
gas properties in Alberta to a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi
National Energy Co. for about C$285 million.  
 Suncor’s production jumped 89 percent to the equivalent of
633,900 barrels of oil a day, reflecting the takeover.  
 Oil-sands output fell 1.8 percent to 295,500 barrels a day,
due to planned maintenance at one of two oil sands upgraders in
May and July.  
 Oil Prices  
 New York oil prices surged to an average $78.05 a barrel in
the second quarter, up 31 percent from $59.79 a year earlier.
Suncor bought  Petro-Canada  for C$25.9 million in August 2009.  
 Suncor is the second-largest oil-sands company, ranking
behind Syncrude Canada Ltd., a venture it holds a 12 percent
stake in which is led by Canadian Oil Sands Trust. Alberta’s
sands hold the world’s largest oil deposits outside Saudi
Arabia, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers.  
 Canadian oil sands are poised to be the top source of crude
imports to the U.S. this year, according to a May report by IHS-
Cambridge Energy Research Associates.  
 Suncor released its results before the start of regular
trading on North American markets. The shares fell 45 cents to
C$33.04 on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday and are down 11
percent for the year. The company has 20 buy and four hold
ratings from  analysts .  
 (Suncor is scheduled to hold an earnings conference call
for investors and analysts, starting at 9:30 a.m. New York time.
