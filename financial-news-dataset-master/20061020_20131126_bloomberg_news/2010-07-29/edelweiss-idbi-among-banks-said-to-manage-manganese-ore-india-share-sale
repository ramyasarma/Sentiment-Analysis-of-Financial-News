             Edelweiss Capital Ltd., IDBI Capital
Market Services Ltd. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are likely to
manage Manganese Ore (India) Ltd.’s initial public offering,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  
 The sale may raise about 15 billion rupees ($322 million),
the people said, declining to be named before an official
announcement. The lowest fees bid for managing the sale was
0.000001 percent, they said. Banks shortlisted for state share
sales need to match the lowest fee bid to win the mandate.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , UBS AG and  Deutsche Bank AG  were
among 10 banks competing to manage the IPO, according to the
disinvestment department. Kotak Mahindra Capital Co., Enam
Securities Pvt., Avendus Capital Pvt. and SBI Capital Markets
Ltd. had also bid.  
 The central government will divest a 10 percent stake in
Manganese Ore and the state governments of Madhya Pradesh and
Maharashtra will sell 5 percent each, Disinvestment Secretary
 Sumit Bose  told reporters in Mumbai on July 26.  
 Spokespeople at the shortlisted banks didn’t immediately
respond to e-mails seeking comment. K.J. Singh, the chairman of
the company, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail.  
 Manganese Ore, set up in 1896, is the nation’s largest
producer of the ore, meeting 65 percent of domestic demand.
