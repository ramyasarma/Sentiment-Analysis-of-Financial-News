              The European Banking Federation may
increase the number of banks contributing to the euro interbank
offered rate.  
 The panel currently consists of 42 banks. So-called Euribor
measures the rate European banks say they see each other lending
at in euros.  
 The EBF is “considering enlarging the number of panel
banks, but nothing has been decided yet,” Florence Ranson, a
spokeswoman for the EBF in Brussels, said today in a telephone
interview. “Nothing will be decided for sure before the next
meeting, which is in November,”  
 Three-month Euribor rose to 0.899 percent today from 0.896
percent yesterday, data from the EBF showed. That’s the highest
since July 30, 2009. Three-month euro Libor advanced to 0.833
percent today, according to the British Bankers’ Association,
seven basis points less than the Euribor figure.
