             BP Plc , seeking cash to help pay for
the worst U.S. oil spill, is moving ahead with asset sales by
hiring HSBC Holdings Plc to sell its stake in a natural-gas
field in Vietnam valued at about $1.3 billion, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  
 BP will begin the sale process next month and give out
information on the assets, which include the gas field, a
pipeline and a power station, to potential buyers, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the details are
private. BP spokesman  Toby Odone  and HSBC spokesman  Brendan McNamara  declined to comment.  
 BP, Europe’s largest oil producer by volume, last week
agreed to sell oil and gas fields in the U.S., Canada and Egypt
to Houston-based Apache Corp. for $7 billion as part of a plan
to sell up to $30 billion of assets to raise cash to meet the
costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Oil & Natural Gas Corp.,
India’s biggest energy exploration company, has a 45 percent
stake in the venture and may consider bidding with Vietnam Oil &
Gas Group for BP’s stake in the field, ONGC said last week.  
 The Nam Con Son gas project in Vietnam is valued at $1.3
billion, London-based BP said on its website. BP’s assets in
Vietnam and Pakistan may be worth $1.7 billion, ING Wholesale
Banking analyst  Jason Kenney , said last week. BP discovered four
offshore gas fields south of Ho Chi Minh City in the early 1990s
and the area started producing gas in 2003.  
 BP may seek offers for several  other holdings , including
its 60 percent stake in Argentina’s Pan American Energy LLC,
Argentina’s second-largest oil producer, and fields in Venezuela
and Colombia, a person familiar with the matter said this month.  
 BP recently hired Barclays Plc’s Barclays Capital unit to
help it sell the Colombian assets, said a person with knowledge
of that assignment, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Reuters
previously reported Barclays’s hiring.
