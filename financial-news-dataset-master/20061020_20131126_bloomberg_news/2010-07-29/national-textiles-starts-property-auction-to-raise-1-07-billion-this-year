             India’s state-owned National
Textiles Corp. today began an online auction of land in central
Mumbai as it seeks to raise $1.07 billion from selling property
nationwide to become profitable this financial year.  
 Indiabulls Infratech Ltd. , Lodha Ultimate Buildtech & Farms
Pvt. and DB View Infracon Pvt. are among eight companies vying
to buy 2.39 acres (9664.4 square meters), according to an e-
mailed statement from the ministry of textiles. The auction of
the plot, which has a minimum price of 2.5 billion rupees, will
end July 31.  
 National Textile , which is selling 10.77 acres in the
central Mumbai area of Worli in two auctions, hopes to raise 20
billion rupees ($429 million), Textile Minister Dayanidhi Maran
said in New Delhi today. That will account for part of the 50
billion rupees it aims to get in the year ending March 31 by
selling properties in cities including Bangalore and Kanpur.  
 Peninsula Realestate Management Pvt. and Videocon Realty &
Infrastructure Ltd. are among seven companies that will bid from
Aug. 4 to Aug. 6 for 8.37 acres, according to the statement. The
government has set 7.5 billion rupees as the minimum price for
the land.
