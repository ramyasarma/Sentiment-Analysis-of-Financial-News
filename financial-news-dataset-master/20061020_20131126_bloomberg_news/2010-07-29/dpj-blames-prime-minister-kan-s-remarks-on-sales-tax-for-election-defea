             The ruling  Democratic Party of Japan 
concluded that Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s remarks on raising the
consumption tax were responsible for the party’s election defeat,
which led the DPJ to lose control of the upper house.  
 Yukio Edano , the party’s No. 2 official, is presenting the
findings of an election analysis today to DPJ lawmakers. The
party lost ten seats in the upper-house ballot.  
 Kan’s proposal to start cross-party talks on the 5 percent
sales tax was perceived “as abrupt and with suspicion,”
according to a document distributed to lawmakers today, which
was obtained by Bloomberg News. Voters hesitated to support the
DPJ and “rapidly lost expectations,” the document said.  
 Kan, 63, who took office last month, may face a challenge
as party chief in September. He became Japan’s fifth leader in
four years when he replaced  Yukio Hatoyama , who quit over
campaign-funding scandals and a broken promise to relocate a U.S.
military base.  
 DPJ lawmakers from both chambers gathered today to review
the July 11 election results. While some in attendance called
for leaders to take responsibility, at least three demanded
Kan’s resignation.  
 “I fully understand there is criticism against my staying
as the party leader, but I’d like to continue with the current
position,” said Kan at the end of the meeting. “Our party
leader’s race in September will decide whether you’ll allow me
to continue my job in the party.”  
 The party document also said a strategy by the DPJ’s former
secretary general  Ichiro Ozawa  to field two candidates in multi-
seat districts failed. Ozawa quit as the party’s No. 2 official
when Hatoyama stepped down. The document suggested implementing
policies targeted at rural voters after a poor performance in
single-seat races in Japan’s countryside.
