             Caltex Australia Ltd. , the nation’s
biggest oil refiner, called for increased government funding to
spur biofuels development as part of an effort to curb
greenhouse-gas emissions and bolster energy security.  
 Australia has “inadequate funding” for biofuels, with the
government devoting just $15 million to the technology,  Julian Segal , chief executive officer of Caltex, said in a speech in
Sydney today. The U.S. Department of Energy by contrast is
investing more than $1 billion to advance the field, he said.  
 “The determination of countries like the United States and
China to find sustainable solutions to liquid energy supply
should not be underestimated,” he said.  
 Caltex, the Australian refiner half-owned by San Ramon,
California-based  Chevron Corp. , plans to sell a new “high
ethanol-content” fuel later this year, Segal said. Australia
must have policies to encourage alternative fuels, he said.  
 Segal, who became CEO in 2009, told reporters Caltex would
consider acquiring refineries in Australia if they were up for
sale and “if it made economic sense.” He declined to comment
on Caltex’s outlook for refining margins.  
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc , which operates the Clyde and Geelong
refineries in Australia, may sell its “downstream” assets in
the country, Goldman Sachs JBWere said yesterday.  
 BP Plc  runs the Kwinana refinery in Western Australia and
the Bulwer Island plant in Queensland. The London-based company
plans to sell as much as $30 billion of assets over the next 18
months to cover costs from the Gulf of Mexico spill.
