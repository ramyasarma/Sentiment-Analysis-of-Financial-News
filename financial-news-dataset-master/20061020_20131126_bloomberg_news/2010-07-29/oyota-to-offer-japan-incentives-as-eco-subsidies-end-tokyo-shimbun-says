             Toyota Motor Corp. will offer a
50,000 yen ($576) cash incentive to car buyers in Japan starting
in October, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.   
 The Japanese government will end subsidies for eco-friendly
cars at the end of September, the report said.
