             Indonesia’s Supreme Court has
recommended that Schapelle Corby’s jail sentence be reduced, the
Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported on its website without
saying where it got the information.                        The
fate of the former beauty student from Australia’s Gold Coast is
to be considered by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono, the report said.                                 A
Supreme Court judge has recommended Corby’s 20-year sentence be
cut, the report said. Corby has served five years of the
sentence.
