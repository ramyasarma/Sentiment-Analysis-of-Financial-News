             Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  fell after some companies lowered their forecasts and
the yen appreciated.  
 American depositary receipts of Advantest Corp., the
world’s biggest maker of memory-chip testers, dropped 0.3
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo after Nvidia Corp.,
a U.S. graphics chips designer, cut its sales forecast. Those of
Honda Motor Co., lost 1 percent after Kyodo News reported the
automaker will cut domestic production. Those of Sony Corp., the
world’s No. 3 television maker, surged 6.1 percent after the
company raised its full-year profit forecast. ADRs of Westpac
Banking Corp. fell 0.8 percent from the close in Sydney.  
 “Some U.S. companies, technology firms in particular, are
cautious about the earnings outlook and they cut their forecasts,
so that may weigh on the market,” said  Juichi Wako , a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “However,
Japanese companies’ earnings are steadily improving. This will
likely support the market.”  
 Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
September closed at 9,640 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,700 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,640 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
 S&P/ASX 200 Index  slid 0.4 percent today. New Zealand’s  NZX 50
Index  gained 0.2 percent in Wellington.  
 Earnings Peak  
 Today is the peak for April-June  earnings reports  in Japan,
with 322 companies out of the 1,671 in the Topix index
announcing results today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  retreated 0.1
percent. In New York, the S&P 500 yesterday fell 0.4 percent to
1,101.53 as earnings and forecasts disappointed investors at
technology and consumer companies.  
 Nvidia, which designs graphics chips, lowered its second-
quarter sales forecast and LSI Corp., a U.S. maker of chips used
in computer disk drives, forecast sales lower than analysts’
estimates.  
 The number of Americans filing first-time claims for
unemployment insurance fell to 457,000 last week from a revised
468,000, Labor Department figures showed yesterday in Washington.
Applications were in line with the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 Valuations, Yen  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has lost 0.6 percent in 2010,
compared with a 1.2 percent drop by the  S&P 500  and a 0.9
percent gain by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.4 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 13.3 times for the S&P and 11.9 times for the Stoxx.  
 The yen appreciated to 86.69 against the dollar, compared
with 87.26 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday. The
stronger yen reduces income at Japanese companies when overseas
revenue is converted into local currency.  
 The London Metal Exchange Index, a  measure  of six metals
including copper and zinc, advanced 1 percent yesterday. Crude
oil for September delivery gained for the first time in a week,
rising 1.8 percent to $78.36 a barrel in New York yesterday.  
 Japan’s unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 5.3
percent in June from 5.2 percent a month earlier, the statistics
bureau said today. The median forecast of 26 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News was 5.2 percent.  
 Consumer prices excluding fresh food fell 1 percent in June
from a year earlier, after a 1.2 percent decline in May, the
statistics bureau said today.  
 The Trade Ministry is scheduled to announce the nation’s
industrial production at 8:50 a.m. in Tokyo. Factory output rose
0.2 percent in June from May, according to the median estimate
of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
