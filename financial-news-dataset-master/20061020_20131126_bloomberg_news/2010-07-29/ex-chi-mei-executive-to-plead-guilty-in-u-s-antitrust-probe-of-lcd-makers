             A former  Chi Mei Optoelectronics
Corp.  sales director agreed to plead guilty in a U.S. antitrust
investigation of makers of thin-film transistor liquid crystal
displays, federal prosecutors said.  
 Wen-Hung “Amigo” Huang, a resident of Taiwan, agreed to
plead guilty to conspiracy to fix prices of LCD panels and to
serve nine months in prison, the Justice Department said in a
statement yesterday. Huang is the third former Chi Mei executive
to plead guilty in the case.  
 Chi Mei, which  merged  with Innolux Display Corp. in March
to form  Chimei Innolux Corp. , Taiwan’s biggest maker of LCDs
used in televisions, computers and mobile phones, pleaded guilty
last year and agreed to pay $220 million in fines. Eight
companies and 18 executives have been charged in the ongoing
investigation, the Justice Department said  
 Huang’s lawyer, John Eisenberg, declined to comment on the
plea agreement.  
 The case is U.S. v. Huang, 10-00579, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco.)
