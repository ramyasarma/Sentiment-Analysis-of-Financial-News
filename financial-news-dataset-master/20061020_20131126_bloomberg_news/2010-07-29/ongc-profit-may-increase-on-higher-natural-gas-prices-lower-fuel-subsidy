             Oil & Natural Gas Corp. ’s profit may
rise from this quarter after the government more than doubled
natural gas prices and freed gasoline rates from state control.  
 India’s biggest energy explorer may add as much as 9
billion rupees ($193 million) to its profit and 16 billion
rupees to its sales this quarter onward because of higher gas
prices, Chairman and Managing Director R.S. Sharma said at a
press conference in New Delhi yesterday.  
 Net income  fell 25 percent to 36.6 billion rupees in the
three months ended June 30, from 48.5 billion rupees a year
earlier, ONGC said in a statement yesterday. That compares with
the 38.5 billion-rupee mean  estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The company is seeking to increase natural gas output
61 percent in six years from domestic areas and buy fields
overseas to meet demand in Asia’s third-biggest consumer.  
 “We will have better results from this quarter because of
the full impact of the higher gas prices,” Sharma said.
“Subsidies will also come down because of the fuel price
increases.”  
 The government allowed ONGC to more than double gas prices
to 6,818 rupees per thousand cubic meters from 3,200 rupees,
Information Minister  Ambika Soni  said May 19. The explorer
started charging the higher prices from June 1, Sharma  said
yesterday.  
 The nation freed gasoline prices from state control on June
25 and increased rates of diesel, cooking gas and kerosene
helping cut losses at state-run refiners.  
 Positive Triggers  
 “All of these will help ONGC put the first quarter behind
them,” said  Deepak Pareek , a Mumbai-based analyst with Angel
Broking Ltd. “These are the positive triggers.”  
 ONGC  declined 1 percent to 1,246.55 rupees in Mumbai
trading yesterday compared with a 0.2 percent gain in the
benchmark  Sensitive Index . The shares have climbed 5.8 percent
this year.  
 The New Delhi-based explorer sold crude oil at $48.04 a
barrel in the three months compared with $58.25 a barrel a year
ago, according to the statement. Crude oil in New York trading
averaged $81.48 a barrel in the quarter ended June 30, 17
percent higher than a year earlier. Crude for September delivery
declined as much as 48 cents or 0.6 percent, to $76.51 a barrel,
in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and
traded for $76.73 as of 1:08 p.m. London time.  
 Profit Target  
 The explorer is targeting net income of 140.6 billion
rupees and crude oil production of 27 million metric tons in the
financial year ending March 31, ONGC said in a March 19
statement. The company plans to spend $5 billion to develop nine
new gas discoveries off India’s east coast, which may start
production in 2016, two people with direct knowledge of the
matter said July 26.  
 The company may consider bidding jointly with Vietnam Oil &
Gas Group, also known as PetroVietnam, for BP Plc’s stake in a
gas field in Vietnam to secure fuel supplies, Sharma said July
22. Oil India, the nation’s second-biggest state explorer, may
be brought in as a partner, he said.  
 ONGC is seeking to diversify its supplies and keep pace
with India’s growing fuel needs as Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  predicts the economy will expand more than 8.5 percent
in the year ending March 31 and 9 percent the following year.
The company plans to get the equivalent of  60 million  tons of
oil from overseas fields by 2025, or more than double its output
in India.  
 The explorer, which currently produces about 62 million
cubic meters a day of gas from its domestic fields, plans to
boost output to 70 million cubic meters a day by 2012 and 100
million cubic meters a day by 2016, Sharma said.
