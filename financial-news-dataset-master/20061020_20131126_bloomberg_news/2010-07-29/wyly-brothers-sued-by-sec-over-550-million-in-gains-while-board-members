             The Securities and Exchange
Commission said it sued brothers Samuel E. Wyly and Charles J.
Wyly, Jr. of Dallas with violating federal securities laws
governing ownership and trading of securities by corporate
insiders.  The Wyly brothers reaped more than $550 million in
undisclosed gains while sitting on corporate boards by trading
stock in those public companies through hidden entities located
in foreign jurisdictions, the SEC said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The companies involved were  Michaels Stores Inc., Sterling
Software Inc., Sterling Commerce Inc., and Scottish Annuity &
Life Holdings Ltd. (now known as Scottish Re Group Ltd.),
according to the statement.
