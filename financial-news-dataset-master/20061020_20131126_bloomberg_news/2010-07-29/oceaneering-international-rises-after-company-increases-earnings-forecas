             Oceaneering International Inc. 
gained the most in more than one month in New York trading after
the world’s largest provider of remote-operated vehicles boosted
its 2010 profit forecast, citing higher income from services at
BP Plc’s Macondo well and from subsea products.  
 Oceaneering, based in Houston, rose $3.78, or 8 percent, to
$50.96 as of 4:05 p.m. in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. The  stock  reached $51.40 in earlier trading
today.  
 Per-share earnings this year will be $3.20 to $3.40, up
from a previous company forecast of $2.80 to $3.10, Oceaneering
said yesterday in a statement after U.S. stock markets closed.
The company was expected to earn $3 a share, the average of 19
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Oceaneering said it had an improved outlook for subsea
products such as control valves and remote-operated vehicle
parts and services. The company said the Gulf of Mexico, where
BP’s damaged well leaked oil for about three months, will remain
“one of the best frontiers for adding large hydrocarbon
reserves with high production flow rates.”  
 Second-quarter net income rose to $54.3 million, or 98
cents a share, from $48.1 million, or 87 cents, a year earlier,
Oceaneering said.
