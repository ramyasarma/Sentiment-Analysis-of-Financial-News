             Softbank Corp. ’s first-quarter
operating profit rose as demand for  Apple Inc. ’s iPhone
bolstered data revenue and offset a decline in voice traffic
that eroded earnings at larger  NTT DoCoMo Inc.   
 Operating profit , or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, increased 45 percent to 156.6 billion
yen ($1.8 billion) as revenue increased 5.2 percent to 700.8
billion yen in the three months ended June 30, Softbank said
today. Separately, DoCoMo reported  operating  income dropped 4.5
percent to 240.5 billion yen, while sales rose 0.4 percent to
1.09 trillion yen.  
 Softbank, Japan’s third-biggest wireless carrier and the
exclusive provider of the iPhone in the country, plans record
investment upgrading its network this year to handle growing
data traffic. The iPhone, Japan’s most-popular smartphone, may
face increasing competition as DoCoMo and  KDDI Corp.  roll out
models running  Google Inc. ’s Android software.  
 Net income  at Softbank fell 29 percent to 19.4 billion yen
in the quarter, the Tokyo-based carrier said, citing a tax
charge at Internet affiliate  Yahoo Japan Corp.  DoCoMo, Japan’s
largest mobile-phone operator, said  net income  fell 3.5 percent
to 142.1 billion yen in the period.  
 Softbank earlier this month said a 26.5 billion yen tax
charge at Yahoo Japan would reduce profit by 24.8 billion yen in
the quarter. Softbank owns 39 percent of the Internet services
affiliate.  
 Record Investment  
 Network spending will probably rise to a record 400 billion
yen this year, Softbank said in April, reiterating its March
outlook. The investment will double the number of wireless base
stations to 120,000 in the period, the carrier said at the time,
helping handle increasing traffic from smartphones, devices that
can surf the Web and download music, video and applications.  
 Japan iPhone shipments more than doubled to 1.69 million in
the year ended March 31,  MM Research Institute Ltd.  said in
April. Apple captured 72 percent of the country’s smartphone
market, followed by Taiwan’s HTC Corp. and  Toshiba Corp. , the
Tokyo-based researcher said.  
 DoCoMo in April began selling its second Android model,
Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB’s  Xperia , while KDDI
introduced its first phone running Android in June, a  Sharp Corp. 
model. Softbank, whose first Android phone went on sale in April,
began selling the iPhone 4 on June 24.  
 Softbank  fell 1.1 percent to close at 2,595 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange before the earnings announcement, narrowing
its gain this year to 20 percent.  DoCoMo  fell 0.4 percent to
close at 138,200 yen in Tokyo trading. The stock has added 6.6
percent this year, compared with an 8.1 percent decline by the
benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average .
