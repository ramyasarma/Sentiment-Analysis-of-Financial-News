             The dollar may advance, after
sliding 6.4 percent against the euro this month, as the U.S.
economic recovery strengthens, according to Barclays Plc.  
 “Our economists do not feel the relative underperformance
of U.S. economic data will continue,”  Raghav Subbarao , a
foreign-exchange strategist in London, wrote in a research
report today. “The euro area has seen a series of upside
surprises recently and we do not expect this trend to continue
either. If concerns about global growth resurface then we could
see safe-haven flows back into the U.S, leading to dollar
appreciation.”  
 The euro climbed 0.6 percent to $1.3075 as of 9:40 a.m. in
London. The dollar is heading for its first loss this month
against the 16-nation currency since November.
