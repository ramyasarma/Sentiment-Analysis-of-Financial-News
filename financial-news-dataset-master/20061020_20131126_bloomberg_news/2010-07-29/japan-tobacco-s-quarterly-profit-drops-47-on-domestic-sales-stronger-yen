             Japan Tobacco Inc. , the world’s
third-largest publicly traded cigarette maker, said first-
quarter  profit  fell 47 percent after domestic sales dropped and
a stronger yen reduced the value of overseas  earnings .  
 Net income  dropped to 22.8 billion yen ($261 million) for
the three months ended June, compared with 42.9 billion yen a
year earlier, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement today.
Last year’s profit was inflated by a one-time gain of 9.1
billion yen from the sale of corporate housing. Total  sales  rose
0.3 percent to 1.47 trillion yen.  
 Japan Tobacco  said its cigarette sales in Japan may decline
16 percent this fiscal year as the government plans to raise
taxes by 70 yen per pack in October. The maker of Mild Seven and
Seven Stars will raise prices more than needed to compensate for
the higher tax, as it also seeks to offset lower product sales.  
 Domestic cigarette sales slipped 7.9 percent in the first
quarter, “primarily due to the on-going declining trend in
consumption and was further depressed by the announcement of a
forthcoming price increase,” the company said in the statement.  
 The company kept its annual earnings  forecast  unchanged. Net
income will probably decline 3.9 percent to 133 billion yen for
the year ending March, it said April 28. Sales may fall 2.5
percent to 5.98 trillion yen.  
 Japan Tobacco  fell 1.9 percent to 287,000 yen at the 3 p.m.
close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange before the company released
its results. The stock has  lost  8.3 percent this year, compared
with a 5 percent drop in the broader  Topix  index.  
 Operating Profit  
 Operating profit  fell 6.1 percent in the first quarter, as
domestic sales slumped and the price of overseas tobacco leaf
increased, Japan Tobacco said.  
 Sales after exercise taxes fell 0.6 percent to 601.4
billion yen. The company raised prices of cigarettes in Russia
and other overseas countries, helping offset lower domestic
sales,  Japan Tobacco  said.  
 Japan Tobacco  was also hammered by a stronger yen, which
has risen against all the world’s major currencies in 2010. A
stronger local currency cuts the value of overseas earnings when
repatriated. The company booked an exchange loss of 2.65 billion
yen in the first quarter.  
 Japan Tobacco  acquired RJR Nabisco’s international
businesses, including the Camel and Winston brands, in 1999 and
the U.K.’s  Gallaher Group  in 2007.  
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization for  Japan Tobacco ’s international business rose 1.8
percent in dollar terms, the company said. The company boosted
its market share in countries including Russia, Italy and France,
it said.  
 The cigarette maker booked a one-time charge of 13.2
billion yen to settle claims with Canada that its JTI-Macdonald
Corp. unit aided cigarette smuggling in the 1990s.
