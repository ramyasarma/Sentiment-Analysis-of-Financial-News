             Wheat rose, heading for the biggest
monthly gain since 1973, and corn and soybeans advanced as hot,
dry weather damaged crops in Russia and other parts of Europe,
boosting demand for U.S. supplies.  
 Temperatures above 100 degrees (38 Celsius) and dry
weather the next 10 days will reduce crop potential in Russia
and Kazakhstan, according to QT Weather in Chicago. Global wheat
and feed-grain production will fall 1.6 percent to 1.753 million
metric tons this year, the lowest in three years, the
International Grains Council said today. World reserves before
next year’s harvest will fall 5.4 percent.  
 “Weather rallies are fast and furious and the adverse
weather has generated new speculative buying interest,” said
 Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler,
Indiana.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery jumped 10.75 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $6.2625 a bushel at 9:55 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $6.32, the highest
level for a most-active contract since June 11, 2009. Before
today, the price rose 28 percent this month, heading for the
largest monthly gain since August 1973.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 6 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.9775 a bushel on the CBOT. The price earlier rose
to $3.995, the highest in a week. Before today, the commodity
gained 14 percent since June 29, the day before the government
said U.S. farmers planted less this year than they had planned.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 9.25 cents,
or 0.9 percent, to $9.8725 a bushel in Chicago.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government figures
show.
