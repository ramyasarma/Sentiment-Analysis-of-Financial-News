             ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd.  and
Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. disagree over the steelmaker’s right to
supplies from the Phoenix mine at 3 percent above production
costs,  Business Day  said, citing ArcelorMittal South Africa’s
Chief Executive Officer Nonkululeko Nyembezi-Heita.  
 Kumba would charge commercial prices for supplies from the
proposed mine, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. Phoenix
could replace Kumba’s ageing Thabazimbi mine and produce about
3.4 million tons from 2016, it said.  
 While the steelmaker paid for an initial study into the
feasibility of the mine and decided in 2006 not to pursue the
project, it reserves the right to change the decision, the
newspaper cited Nyembezi-Heita as saying.
