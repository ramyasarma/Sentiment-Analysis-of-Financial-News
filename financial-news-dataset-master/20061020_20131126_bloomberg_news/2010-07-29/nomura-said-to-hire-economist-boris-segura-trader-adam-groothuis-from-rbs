             Nomura Holdings Inc. hired Latin
America economist  Boris Segura  and trader  Adam Groothuis  from
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, according to people familiar

months, while Groothuis starts on Aug. 2, said the people, who

two years. Groothuis, 39, who worked for a year and a half at

debt and previously worked 16 years at Bear Stearns Cos.  
 Both executives will be based in New York, the people said.  
 Peter Truell , a Nomura spokesman, declined to comment on
Segura’s hiring and didn’t immediately return a call and e-mail
on Groothuis.  Michael Geller , an RBS spokesman, confirmed Segura
and Groothuis no longer work for the bank.  
 Segura and Groothuis follow at least three other RBS
colleagues who have joined Nomura since May.  Benito Berber  was

head of rates and global head of rates sales, respectively.
