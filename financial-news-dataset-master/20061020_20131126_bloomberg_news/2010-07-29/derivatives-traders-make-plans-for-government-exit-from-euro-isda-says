             The implications of a government
leaving the 16-nation euro area are being explored by dealers,
according to the  International Swaps & Derivatives Association .  
 Europe’s budget deficit crisis triggered speculation one or
more of the region’s most indebted nations may quit the euro.
Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece could become more
competitive if they returned to their own currencies, which may
depreciate and allow exports to expand.  
 “While it expresses no view as to the likelihood of such
an event occurring, ISDA has established a discussion group to
explore the different scenarios in which a country may leave the
euro zone,”  Rebecca O’Neill , ISDA’s spokeswoman in London,
wrote in an e-mailed statement. It will “consider what legal
and documentation issues could arise in each for the OTC
derivatives markets and what steps would be necessary in order
to address them,” she wrote.  
 German Chancellor Angel Merkel and French President
Nicholas Sarkozy blamed derivatives such as credit-default swaps
for worsening the fiscal crisis. Germany curbed trading of some
debt and euro-currency contracts in May to ease selling pressure
on the region’s bonds and currency.  
 The story was earlier reported by the  Financial Times .  
 Derivatives are financial instruments derived from stocks,
bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked to specific
events like changes in interest rates or the weather. So-called
over-the-counter derivatives aren’t traded on exchanges.
