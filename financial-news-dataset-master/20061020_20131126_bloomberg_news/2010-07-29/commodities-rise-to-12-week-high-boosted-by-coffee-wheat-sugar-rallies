             Commodities  rose to the highest
level in 12 weeks on speculation that the global economy’s
recovery will lift demand for energy, metals and food.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials climbed
as much as 1.6 percent to 270.53, the highest since May 5.
Coffee, gaining as much as 4.3 percent, approached a 12-year
high. Wheat headed for the biggest monthly gain since 1973.  
 European confidence  in the economic outlook rose in July to
the highest level in more than two years, and U.S. first-time
jobless  claims  fell last week, separate reports showed today.
The CRB index headed for the fourth straight weekly increase.  
 “Investors are flocking into the commodities, everything
from sugar to copper is going up together,” said  Christian Wagner , who helps manage $150 million as chief investment
officer of Longview Capital Management in Wilmington, Delaware.
“There are some good signs for a continued global recovery.”  
 The CRB rose 1 percent to 268.83 at 12:48 p.m. New York
time.  
 Commodity traders increased bets on price gains for raw
materials by 50 percent in the past two weeks at futures
exchanges in New York and Chicago.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators held net-
long positions in gold, copper, crude oil and 17 other
commodities of 782,247 contracts in the week ended July 20,
according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission compiled by Bloomberg. That compared with 520,530
contracts in the week ended July 6. The two-week gain was the
biggest since May 2009.
