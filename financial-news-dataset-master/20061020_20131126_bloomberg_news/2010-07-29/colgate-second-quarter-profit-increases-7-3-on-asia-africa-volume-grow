             Colgate-Palmolive Co., the world’s
largest toothpaste maker, said second-quarter profit rose 7.3
percent, helped by growth in Asia and Africa. The stock fell in
early trading as sales trailed analysts’ estimates.  
 Net income  climbed to $603 million, or $1.17 a share, from
$562 million, or $1.07 a share, a year earlier, Colgate said in
a statement today. That was in line with the $1.17 average of 21
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 1.8
percent to $3.81 billion compared with a $3.94 billion estimate.  
 Colgate, which makes Palmolive dish liquid and Hill’s Pet
Food, has expanded in emerging markets to boost growth. That’s
also increased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations, and
the company said devaluation of Venezuela’s currency would cut
full-year profit by up to 15 cents a share, instead of the
ceiling of 10 cents previously announced.  
 Countries such as India, China and South Africa pushed
second-quarter volume up 11.5 percent for the greater
Asia/Africa division. North America sales increased 4.5 percent,
while volume rose 5 percent, helped by new products such as
Colgate Max White with Mini Bright Strips toothpastes.  
 Colgate fell $3.86 to $80 at 8:09 a.m. New York time.
Before today the shares had gained 2.1 percent this year in New
York Stock Exchange composite  trading .
