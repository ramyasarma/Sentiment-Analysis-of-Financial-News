             U.S. stocks erased gains as declines
in technology and consumer-staples shares wiped out an early
advance triggered by better-than-estimated earnings and a drop
in jobless claims.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percen to 1,105.62 at 11:09 a.m. in New York after rallying as
much as 0.9 percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
climbed 6.66 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 10,504.54,
wiping out most of an 87-point rally.
