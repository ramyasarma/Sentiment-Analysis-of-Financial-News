             AstraZeneca Plc  raised its earnings
forecast for the third time this year and doubled a share
buyback plan as the anti-clot drug Brilinta moved one step
closer to approval and a U.S. court upheld a patent on the
Crestor cholesterol medicine.  
 Second-quarter profit excluding some items rose to $1.79
per share from $1.64 a share, beating the average  estimate  of
$1.58 from 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Earnings for the
year will be $6.35 to $6.65 a share, up from a previous goal of
$6.05 to $6.35, the London-based company said in a
statementtoday. AstraZeneca aims to buy back $2 billion of
shares in 2010, up from a previous target of $1 billion.  
 The U.K.’s  second-largest drugmaker  won the backing of a
Food and Drug Administration advisory panel yesterday for
approval of Brilinta, a potential rival to Sanofi- Aventis SA  and
 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ’s  Plavix , which had $9.8 billion in
sales last year. The company also won a legal victory last month
when a U.S. court upheld a patent on Crestor, removing a threat
to the drug’s $4.5 billion in revenue.  
 “AstraZeneca continues to surprise the market positively,
from Crestor and Brilinta to strong sales growth and good cost
management,” said  Michael Leacock , a Royal Bank of Scotland
analyst who rates the stock a ‘buy,’ in an e-mail.  
 AstraZeneca rose 86.5 pence, or 2.7 percent, to 3,289 pence
at the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in London, the highest  since
October 2006.  
 FDA Panel Vote  
 Outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted
7-1 yesterday in favor of using Brilinta to reduce the risk of
heart attacks, strokes and death in patients with severe chest
pain or earlier heart attacks. The FDA is scheduled to decide on
Brilinta in September.  
 “Regulatory process goes in steps and yesterday was a very
important step,” Chief Executive Officer  David Brennan  said on
a conference call today. “It’s something we’re really excited
about because it’s a really good medicine,” he said in an
interview, also today.  
 The Crestor ruling stoked analyst expectations that the
company would return more of its $9.4 billion in cash and short-
term investments to shareholders. AstraZeneca’s expanded buyback
plan matched the expectations of six out of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “We increased it because we’ve seen a better business
performance in the first half of the year,” Brennan said in the
interview. “We’ll talk about it again at the end of January
when we give our year-end results.”  
 Small Acquisitions  
 AstraZeneca is relying on small  acquisitions , expansion in
emerging markets and treatments from its own labs to replenish
revenue over the next four years as patents expire on top-
sellers  Nexium  for ulcers and the antipsychotic  Seroquel ,
medicines that generated a combined $9.83 billion last year.  
 “We now see earnings momentum slowing as patent expiries
bite,” Leacock wrote in a note to investors on July 27.  
 Brennan has said that sales and earnings will “fluctuate”
until 2014, and that he needs $4 billion to $6 billion in new
sales to meet a revenue target of $28 billion to $34 billion by
then. Revenue reached $32.8 billion in 2009. Brilinta sales
could reach $1.47 billion by 2016, according to the average
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The drugmaker also aims to boost sales from emerging
economies such as China to 25 percent of annual revenue by 2014.  
 Nine Markets  
 Brennan said today the company will attempt to introduce
Brilinta in nine markets other than the U.S., including Europe,
Canada and Brazil.  
 Second-quarter  net income  gained to $2.11 billion from
$1.71 billion a year earlier, the company said today. Sales
increased to $8.18 billion from $7.96 billion.  
 “The second half will be difficult, but better than our
original expectations due to the timings of generic entry” to
key drugs, Chief Financial Officer  Simon Lowth  said today on a
conference call with journalists.  
 Lowth said the company will update investors on possible
future buyback plans in January 2011. Buybacks and dividends are
“not contingent on the outcome of any product in any one
market,” he said.  
 The company’s forecasted earnings excludes certain charges,
such as those related to its cost-cutting plan and to the
acquisition of MedImmune Inc. in 2007. London-based
GlaxoSmithKline Plc is the U.K.’s biggest drugmaker.
