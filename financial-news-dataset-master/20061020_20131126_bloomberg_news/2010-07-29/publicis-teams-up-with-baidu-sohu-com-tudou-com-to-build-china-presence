             Publicis Groupe SA  is working with
online companies in China including  Baidu Inc. ,  Sohu.com  and
 Tudou.com  to target advertising in the country and help make the
territory one of its biggest markets.  
 “We want to have a very special look at China because I
believe this market has to become one of our most important,”
Publicis Chief Executive Officer  Maurice Levy  said in an
interview last night. A research initiative also involving large
global companies that he didn’t name will start with a focus on
display ads, he said.  
 Publicis , one of the world’s largest advertising companies
and owner of the Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi agencies, is
also drafting a strategic review of China which includes future
acquisitions, Levy said. Publicis competitor  WPP Plc  said this
month that China would become its third-largest market in the
next few years.  
 “I believe we can do better in China,” Levy said. “Our
review will look at our position there and how we should be
conducting business for the next three years.”  
 Marketers and advertising companies are increasing
investments in emerging markets such as China, the world’s most-
populous country and the third-biggest economy.  
 Baidu operates China’s most popular online search engine
while Tudou.com is seen as the country’s answer to YouTube.
Sohu.com Inc. operates China’s fourth-most-visited Web portal.
