             PKN Orlen SA , Poland’s largest oil
refiner, forecasts that it will post net income for the second
quarter due to lower operating costs and price movements on the
oil and product markets.  
 “Macroeconomic factors” including the prices of crude and
of refined products will contribute about 800 million zloty
($260 million) to earnings before interest and taxes, the Plock,
Poland-based company said in a regulatory statement today.
Operating costs will be lower than a year earlier by about 100
million zloty.  
 Net financial costs will be about 1.1 billion zloty as a
weaker zloty pushes up interest costs, the company said.  
 Orlen is scheduled to report full second-quarter earnings
on Aug. 31.
