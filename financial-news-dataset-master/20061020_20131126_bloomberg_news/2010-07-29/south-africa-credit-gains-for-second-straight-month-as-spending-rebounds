             South African  credit increased for
the second consecutive month in June after the central bank cut
its benchmark interest  rate  to the lowest in at least a decade,
spurring spending.  
 Borrowing  by households and businesses rose an annual 0.92
percent after gaining 0.8 percent in May, the Reserve Bank said
on its website today. The  median estimate  of 16 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a gain of 1.1 percent.  
 The Reserve Bank cut its benchmark interest  rate  by half a
percentage point to 6.5 percent in May, the seventh reduction
since December 2008. That has helped to lower debt costs and
offset the impact of rising  job losses , strengthening the
economy’s recovery.  
 “Credit demand remains relatively subdued,” said  Kevin Lings , an economist at Stanlib Asset Management in Johannesburg.
“We still expect credit growth, especially consumer credit, to
drift only modestly higher during the remainder of 2010, but a
little more meaningfully higher in 2011.”  
 The rand was at 7.2894 against the dollar as of 10:26 a.m.
in Johannesburg from 7.3567 before the data was released.  
 Retail  sales  rose for a fifth consecutive month in May,
increasing an annual 4.6 percent, the statistics office said on
July 14. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of
expenditure in the economy.  
 Governor  Gill Marcus  left the key rate unchanged on July 22
as consumer spending rebounds and rising wage demands threaten
to stoke inflation. The  inflation  rate fell to an annual 4.2
percent in June from 4.6 percent in the previous month,
increasing speculation the central bank may lower interest rates
at its next meeting in September.  
 The broad  M3  measure of money supply rose an annual 2.41
percent in June, after gaining 1.4 percent in May, the central
bank said. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for M3
to expand 2.3 percent.
