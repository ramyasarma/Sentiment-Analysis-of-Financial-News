             Bank of America Corp.  and Spain’s
 Banco Santander SA  are having to pay up to sell bonds even amid
renewed confidence financial companies have sufficient capital
to survive an economic slump.  
 Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender, is selling 2
billion euros ($2.6 billion) of seven-year notes at a yield of
212.5 basis points over the benchmark mid-swap rate, 22.5 basis
points more than it paid on its last benchmark euro deal in
March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Spain’s No. 1
bank is also paying extra for its first public issue of fixed-
rate senior, unsecured bonds since February.  
 The new deals follow fundraisings by  Credit Suisse Group AG 
and Spain’s  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA  as confidence is
lifted by the results of last week’s bank stress tests. The
extra yield investors demand to own European financial debt over
government notes dropped 13 basis points to 220 since results
were released July 23, the lowest since May 12, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s EMU Financial Corporate Index.
The spread fell to 169 basis points on April 16.  
 “The market is still semi-dysfunctional and the
fundamental problems haven’t gone away,” said  John Anderson ,
who helps manage about 23 billion pounds ($36 billion) of assets
as head of credit at Gartmore Investments in London. “This is
the first few days of a rally and it could end as quickly as it
started.”  
 Santander Issue  
 Santander is selling 1.5 billion euros of four-year bonds
priced to yield 160 basis points more than swaps, a person with
knowledge of the deal said. That compares with the 105 basis-
point spread on the lender’s 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of
 five-year notes  in February. The outstanding 2015 debt now
trades at 148 basis points over swaps, composite prices on
Bloomberg show.  
 Bank of America paid a spread of 190 basis points when it
raised 1.5 billion euros of 4.75 percent notes due 2017 on March
11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The cost of insuring bank debt from default fell today,
with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 25 banks and insurers dropping 2.5 basis points to
113, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The gauge is down 49
basis points in July and is heading for a record monthly
decline.  
 “Sentiment is much more positive,” said  Stuart Thomson ,
who helps manage the equivalent of about $1 billion at Ignis
Management in Glasgow. “There’s demand today for financials
that wasn’t there a few weeks ago.”  
 BBVA issued 1.25 billion euros of five-year notes yesterday
in the first public sale of senior unsecured securities by a
Spanish bank since April.  Credit Suisse , Switzerland’s largest
bank priced $1.5 billion of so-called Tier 1 bonds today.  
 OAO Gazprombank , the lending arm of Russia’s natural gas
export monopoly, is selling $500 million of bonds due December
2014 that may be priced to yield 6.25 percent to 6.375 percent,
two people with knowledge of the sale said.
