             Donald Yacktman , whose $2.3 billion
 Yacktman Fund  has outperformed 97 percent of funds with similar
objectives over the past five years, said he likes shares of
 Microsoft Corp. , Viacom Inc. and  ConocoPhillips .  
 Microsoft “is dirt-cheap,” Yacktman, whose fund has
posted an annualized return of 7.2 percent since mid-2005, said
today in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “The wind
continues to blow to a large degree at their back.”  
 The world’s largest software maker has fallen 17 percent
since its 2010 peak on April 22 while the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  has dropped 8.9 percent. The Redmond, Washington-based
company posted record fourth-quarter revenue on July 23 after
the most successful debut of its flagship operating system. The
stock rose 0.3 percent to $26.03 at 4 p.m. New York time today.  
 Viacom , which has the Jersey Shore reality TV series on its
network, “is still relatively cheap,” said the founder of
Yacktman Asset Management Co. “The real pieces of this company
are the stable pieces of Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and MTV. In
total the viewership at Viacom represents about 20 percent of
cable TV so that’s a huge share.”  
 Viacom, based in New York and controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , has gained 11 percent this year. The Class B shares
gained 0.2 percent to $32.94  today .  
 ConocoPhillips, the U.S. oil company which is in the middle
of a $10 billion asset-sale program, “is a very cheap stock,”
Yacktman said. “Once the economy heats up, I think we’re going
to see oil prices heading north.”  
 The  company , which plans to sell its entire 20 percent
stake in Russia’s OAO Lukoil, has fallen 8.6 percent since May
3. The stock rose 1.2 percent to $54.56 today.
