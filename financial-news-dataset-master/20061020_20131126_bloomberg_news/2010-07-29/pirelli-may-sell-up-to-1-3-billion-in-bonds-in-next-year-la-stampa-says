             Pirelli & C SpA , Europe’s third-
largest tiremaker, may sell between 750 million euros ($976
million) and 1 billion euros in bonds in the next year, daily La
Stampa reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 Pirelli may issue the bonds, which will probably expire in
five years, to diversify financing and reduce its bank debt,
according to the Italian newspaper. The board may approve the
sale at a meeting today, La Stampa reported.  
 Pirelli’s documentation manager for the transaction is
Barclays Capital, the newspaper said.
