             Japan’s government is considering
adopting an auction system for spectrum for new high-speed
services, Nikkei English News said, without citing anyone.  
 The Communications Ministry will discuss the matter today,
the report said. The government has ruled out auctions when
expanding spectrum for mobile-phone services, the report said.
