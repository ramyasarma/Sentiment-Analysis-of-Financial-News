             North Korea signed an economic and
technical cooperation agreement with China today, a week after
U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  announced further trade
sanctions to halt the regime’s nuclear-weapons program.  
 Liu Hongcai, the Chinese ambassador to North Korea, and Ri
Ryong Nam, the nation’s Minister of Foreign Trade, signed the
agreement during a ceremony held in Pyongyang, according to the
state-run Korean Central News Agency. It didn’t elaborate.  
 Clinton announced sanctions that target government
officials and the foreign banks that help sustain the North’s
weapons industry during a visit to Seoul last week. The U.S. has
backed South Korean claims that the North torpedoed one of its
ships and has been pressing for an international effort to put
more pressure on  Kim Jong Il ’s regime.  
 China has so far refused to condemn North Korea for the
attack on the Cheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors.
China accounted for 79 percent of the North’s 2009 international
trade, according to the Seoul-based Korea Trade-Investment
Promotion Agency. China provides almost 90 percent of energy
imports and 45 percent of the country’s food, according to a
July 2009 report by the New York-based Council on Foreign
Relations.  
 China’s Foreign Ministry had no knowledge of the agreement
and the Commerce Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a fax
seeking comments.
