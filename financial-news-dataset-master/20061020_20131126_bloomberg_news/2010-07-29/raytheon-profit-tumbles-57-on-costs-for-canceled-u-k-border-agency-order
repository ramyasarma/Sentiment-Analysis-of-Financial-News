             Raytheon Co. , the world’s largest
missile maker, said second-quarter profit dropped on costs
related to a contract canceled by the U.K. government.  
 Net income  fell 57 percent to $208 million, or 55 cents a
share, from $489 million, or $1.23, a year earlier, the Waltham,
Massachusetts-based company said in a statement today. Profit
from operations excluding the canceled contract was $1.27 a
share. Analysts predicted $1.19, the average  estimate  of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Profit was lowered by a charge of $274 million, or 71
cents, related to the end of the U.K. Border Agency order. The
U.K. government said July 22 that it ended the contract to
collect and analyze data on travelers to and from the country
after the U.K. Home Office said critical parts for the program
were running 12 months late.  
 The termination led Raytheon to lower its 2010 sales
forecast range. The company said sales will rise to $25.6
billion to $26.1 billion, compared with an earlier forecast of
$25.9 billion to $26.4 billion.  
 In a July 23 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, Raytheon said the program called eBorders had
approximately $400 million in assets and letters of credit,
which includes approximately $300 million of billed and unbilled
receivables.  
 Raytheon fell 4 cents to $48.27 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange  composite trading . The shares declined 6.3 percent this
year before today.
