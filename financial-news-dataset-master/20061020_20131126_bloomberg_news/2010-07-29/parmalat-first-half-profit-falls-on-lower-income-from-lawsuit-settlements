             Parmalat SpA , Italy’s biggest dairy
food company, said first-half profit fell because of a drop in
settlements from outstanding legal cases.  
 Net income declined to 147.4 million euros ($193 million)
from 248 million euros in the first half of 2009, the
Collecchio, Italy-based company said in a statement today.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
rose 8 percent to 174.5 million euros, in line with a 175
million-euro estimate by six analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Parmalat, which pioneered long-life milk in the 1960s,
faces  declining income  from legal settlements from its 2003
bankruptcy, Italy’s biggest. Income from settlements fell in the
first half to 39.7 million euros from 178.7 million a year
earlier. The company confirmed a 2010 Ebitda target of 365
million euros.  
 Sales climbed almost 10 percent to 2.03 billion euros in the
first half from 1.85 billion a year earlier. Sales in Canada,
Parmalat’s biggest market, rose 17 percent to 749.1 million
euros from 638.6 million euros a year earlier.  
 Parmalat shares erased gains after the earnings report and
declined 0.1 percent to 1.932 euros, giving the company a market
value of 3.4 billion euros.  
 Parmalat has recovered about 2 billion euros in legal
settlements from banks and auditors, whom it accused of
sustaining the fraud that led to Italy’s biggest corporate
bankruptcy in 2003. In bankruptcy proceedings, Parmalat
disclosed more than 14 billion euros of debt, about eight times
the amount reported by its former management.
