             The Slovak coalition may lose its
majority in parliament less than two months after elections as
four lawmakers consider leaving the ruling Freedom and
Solidarity party,  Sme  reported.  
 The four legislators, who represent a platform within the
party called Ordinary People, aren’t satisfied with the
government program as it was approved by the Cabinet of Iveta
Radicova yesterday, the newspaper cited Igor Matovic, one of the
four, as saying. They may walk out of the coalition as early as
before the next session of the parliament on Aug. 3, he told
Sme.  
 Still, the four deputies would continue supporting an
eventual minority government, Sme quoted Matovic as saying.
