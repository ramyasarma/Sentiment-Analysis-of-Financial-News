             Colgate-Palmolive Co., the world’s
largest toothpaste maker, fell the most in almost six years
after sales missed analysts’  estimates  and the company said
Venezuela’s currency devaluation would further cut 2010 profit.  
 Colgate dropped $5.74, or 6.8 percent, to $78.12 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the most
since September 2004. The shares have fallen 4.9 percent this
year.  
 “Sales and gross margin were somewhat disappointing and
reflecting both a competitive operating environment and the
impact of foreign exchange,”  Joseph Altobello , an analyst at
Oppenheimer & Co., wrote in a note today.  
 Colgate, which makes Palmolive dish liquid and Hill’s Pet
Food, has expanded in emerging markets to boost  growth . That’s
also increased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations, and
the company said today that devaluation of Venezuela’s currency
would cut full-year profit by up to 15 cents a share, instead of
the ceiling of 10 cents previously announced.  
 Second-quarter net income rose 7.3 percent to $603 million,
or $1.17 a share, in line with the $1.17 average of 21 analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 1.8 percent to $3.81
billion compared with a $3.94 billion estimate.  
 Countries such as India, China and South Africa pushed
second-quarter volume up 11.5 percent for the greater
Asia/Africa division. North America sales increased 4.5 percent,
while volume rose 5 percent, helped by new products such as
Colgate Max White with Mini Bright Strips toothpastes.
