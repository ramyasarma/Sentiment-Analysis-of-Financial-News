             Brazil posted a  budget deficit  for a
second straight month in June after state-controlled companies
increased spending and government tax revenue fell.  
 Brazil had a deficit of 13.6 billion reais ($7.73 billion)
in June, compared with a 14.8 billion-real gap in May, the
 central bank  said today. The figure was higher than the median
forecast of an 11.3 billion-real deficit in a Bloomberg survey
of four analysts.  
 The government’s failure to reign in the budget deficit,
even as Latin America’s biggest economy booms, is keeping
interest rates up and damaging the country’s growth prospects,
said  Roberto Padovani , chief economist at Banco WestLB do Brasil
SA, in a phone interview from Sao Paulo.  
 “I’m really worried about the investment situation in the
country in the coming years” Padovani said. “The public sector
is in a battle with the private sector for resources, there’s
little room to increase state investments and little incentives
to increase private investments.”  
 The primary budget surplus, or the surplus before interest
payments, rose to 2.06 billion reais from 1.43 billion reais in
the previous month. The figure was lower than a median estimate
of 3.9 billion-real surplus in a Bloomberg survey of 11
analysts.  
 Brazil central government will post a “normal” primary
budget surplus before interest payments in July, Treasury
Secretary  Arno Augustin  said yesterday.  
 Funding, Rates  
 Brazil’s net debt as a percentage of gross domestic product
remained unchanged at 41.4 percent in June from May.      The debt
will fall to 41 percent of GDP by the end of 2010 before
declining to 39.50 percent by the end of 2011, according to the
median forecast in a central bank survey of about 100 economists
published July 26.  
 South America’s largest economy will grow 7.2 percent in
2010 and 4.5 percent in 2011, according to the economists who
took part in the survey, keeping net debt down as a proportion
of the economy, even as the government runs deficits.  
 The government collected 61.5 billion reais in taxes in
June, the tax agency said July 15. The figure was lower than the
64 billion-real median forecast of 11 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 Policy makers meeting July 20-21 raised the overnight rate
to 10.75 percent from 10.25 percent, surprising 48 of 51
economists, who expected a 75 basis-point increase.  
 The lower-than-expected rate rise came as the $1.6 trillion
economy showed signs of cooling from an annual growth rate of  9
percent  in the first quarter, its fastest pace since 1995, after
June job creation and tax collection were lower than economists’
forecasts.  
 The real rose 0.3 percent to 1.7632 per U.S. dollar at
10:12 a.m. New York time, from 1.7690 on July 28. In the
overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on the
contract due in January 2011 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 10.82 percent.
