             Mashreqbank PSC , the United Arab
Emirates lender owned by the Al Ghurair family, reported a 54
percent decline in second-quarter profit after setting aside
money to cover for bad loans.  
 Net income fell to 202.2 million dirhams ($55 million),
according to Bloomberg calculations based on half-yearly data
provided by the bank today. First-half profit was 453 million
dirhams, while total operating income dropped 6 percent to 2.3
billion dirhams, according to an e-mailed statement today.  
 “We see signs of recovery and are optimistic of early
economic turnaround,”  Chief Executive Officer  Abdul Aziz al- Ghurair  said in the statement. Mashreqbank set aside 892 million
dirhams for impaired loans and financial assets at the end of
the second quarter, it said.  
 U.A.E. banks are recovering from the global credit crisis,
which weakened lending and investment banking activity, while
provisions for bad loans are rising amid the economic slowdown.
U.A.E. economic growth may accelerate to 3.2 percent this year,
with oil prices at $85 a barrel, from 1.3 percent in 2009,
Economy Minister  Sultan Bin Saeed al-Mansouri  said in May.
