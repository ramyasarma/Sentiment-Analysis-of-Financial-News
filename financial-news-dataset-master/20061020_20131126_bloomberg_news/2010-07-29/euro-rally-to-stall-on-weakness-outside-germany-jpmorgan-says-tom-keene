             The euro’s rally will probably end
as economic weakness in Europe outside Germany saps demand for
the 16-nation currency, according to  Rebecca Patterson  of
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 The currency has rallied 10 percent from a four-year low of
$1.1877 reached June 7, encouraging  hedge funds  and other large
speculators to reduce bets against the currency to a six-month
low. The euro may peak after reaching at least $1.3125, the next
level of technical resistance, according to Patterson.  
 “We’re close to the point where you want to start
lightening up on long euros,” Patterson, global head of foreign
exchange at the private banking unit of JPMorgan in New York,
said in a radio interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance”
with Tom Keene. “Germany is the only element of strength here.
It’s Germany versus the rest of Europe. And I think with that
backdrop, it’s hard to see all of this continuing very far.”  
 The euro climbed 0.7 percent to $1.3086 at 1:49 p.m. in New
York, from $1.2995 yesterday, after advancing to $1.3107, the
highest level since May 4. The shared currency was headed for a
July rally of 6.9 percent versus the greenback after today’s
advance erased last week’s 0.2 percent drop.  
 Europe’s currency traded above $1.31 for the first time in
almost three months after the Federal Labor Agency in Nuremberg
said Germany’s unemployment rate fell this month to 7.6 percent,
from 7.7 percent.  
 “At these levels I’d be happy to start selling it again,”
Patterson said in the interview.  
 Euro Net Shorts  
 The difference in the  number of wagers  by hedge funds and
other large speculators for a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain fell on July 20 to 24,251, the lowest level
since January, according to the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. Net shorts reached a record 113,890
on May 11.  
 The euro also got a boost today as the European
Commission in Brussels said today that an index of executive and
consumer sentiment in the euro nations increased this month to
101.3, the highest since March 2008.  
 The currency region may lag behind other industrialized
economies this year, expanding just 1 percent, the International
Monetary Fund said on July 8. In Japan, the economy may grow 2.4
percent in 2010, while U.S. gross domestic product is seen
increasing 3.3 percent, the IMF forecast.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A resistance level is an area on a
chart where orders to sell a currency versus a counterpart may
be placed, potentially blocking an advance.
