             South African bonds gained, reducing
yields to the lowest in almost 2 1/2 years, after a lower-than-
expected increase in household borrowing raised speculation the
central bank may have room to lower its key interest rate.  
 The government’s 13.5 percent security due September 2015
rose for a second day, gaining 12 cents to 124.70 rand, reducing
the yield by 3 basis points to 7.57 percent as of 9:31 a.m. in
Johannesburg. A close at that level would leave the yield at the
lowest level since February 2009.  
 Credit  extension to South African households and businesses
rose an annual 0.92 percent in June compared with a 0.8 percent
gain in May, the Reserve Bank said on its website today. The
 median estimate  of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
gain of 1.1 percent.  
 “Subdued credit data, together with a better-than-expected
CPI inflation outcome yesterday, could justify lower interest
rates,”  Michael Keenan , a currency strategist at  Standard Bank
Group Ltd.  in Johannesburg, wrote in a client note.  
 Price growth in Africa’s biggest economy has decelerated
for 15 of the past 16 months as a bumper corn crop and the
rand’s almost 29 percent rally since the beginning of 2009
helped curb inflation.  
 Inflation  slowed to 4.2 percent in June from 4.6 percent
the previous month, lower than the 4.5 percent predicted in a
Bloomberg survey, a report showed yesterday. The central bank
has reduced its key  rate  by 5.5 percentage points since December
2008, leaving it unchanged at 6.5 percent on July 22.  
 Rand  
 Policy makers may decide to leave the rate unchanged “at
least until September 2011” as unions drive up wages, according
to Keenan. Even so, that would leave borrowing costs at the
lowest level since the central bank first began using the
repurchase rate in 1999.  
 The rand strengthened 0.3 percent to 7.3160 per dollar,
from a close of 7.3381 yesterday. Against the euro, the rand
lost less than 0.1 percent to 9.5337.  
 Money-market investors increased bets that South Africa’s
central bank will lower its main rate when it next meets on
Sept. 9, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month
contracts for cash in three months  fell 1.5 basis points from
yesterday’s close to 6.225 percent.
