             U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron is
speaking the truth when he urged Pakistan to do more to shut
down terrorist groups operating in the South Asian country,
Foreign Secretary William Hague told reporters in New Delhi
today. Cameron, on a visit to India, said yesterday that “we
cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that Pakistan is allowed
to look both ways, and is able, in any way, to promote the
export of terror.” Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari will
visit the U.K. next week, Hague said.
