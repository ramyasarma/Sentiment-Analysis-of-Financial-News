             Japan’s unemployment rate
unexpectedly rose to a seven-month high in June, adding to
concern consumer spending will stall.  
 The  jobless rate  climbed to 5.3 percent, the statistics
bureau said today in Tokyo. The median  forecast  of 26
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for the rate to stay
at 5.2 percent. Household spending rose 0.5 percent from a year
earlier, a separate report showed.  
 Recent data indicate the world’s second-largest economy
continued to expand last quarter, albeit at a slower pace as
export growth moderated. Companies are still reluctant to
increase their personnel costs, according to economist
 Yoshimasa Maruyama .  
 “Because young people aren’t getting hired, I expect
unemployment to remain at a high level for the coming year,”
Maruyama, a senior economist at Itochu Corp. in Tokyo, said
before the report.  
 Household spending has been buoyed by government
incentives to buy energy-efficient cars and electronics. The
programs are scheduled to expire this year.  
 Renesas Electronics Corp.  will eliminate 5,000 jobs by the
end of fiscal 2012, the company said yesterday. Japan’s second-
largest chipmaker forecasts a net loss of 80 billion yen ($920
million) for the 12 months ending March 31.  
 A separate report today showed that the  job-to-applicant
ratio  rose to 0.52 in June, meaning there are 52 job openings
for every 100 candidates, the most since March 2009.  
 Wages  have gained for three months, an indication
consumers may begin to spend on a wider array of goods and
services, and not just cars and household appliances. Summer
bonuses at large companies rose for the first time in three
years, according to business lobby Keidanren. The money is
often equivalent to several months of pay.
