             Repsol YPF SA , Spain’s biggest oil
company, said second-quarter profit rose 60 percent after crude
prices increased and refining margins improved.  
 Profit  adjusted to exclude inventories and one-time items
increased to 523 million euros ($680 million) from 326 million
euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. That compares with the 455 million euro
median estimate of five  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 The company is investing in exploration in  Brazil ’s
offshore Santos Basin and elsewhere to increase output, while
seeking to reduce exposure to mature fields in  Argentina . As
with companies, its refining margins are now improving after
demand fell last year with the global economic slump.  
 “The positive operating results presented should be enough
to trigger a slight increase in consensus estimates, driven by
better than expected margin recovery in the downstream business
and supported by a strengthening macro environment,” Banco BPI
SA analysts  Bruno Silva ,  Flora Trindade  and Gonzalo Sanchez-
Bordona said today in a research note. They have an
“accumulate” rating on the stock.  
 Repsol  rose as much as 1.7 percent and traded at 18.37
euros at 1:48 p.m. in Madrid. The stock has slipped 1.9 percent
this year, valuing the company at 22.4 billion euros.  
 Refining Margins  
 Besides exploration, Repsol is also spending to improve
refining margins and new units at its Spanish refineries in
Bilbao and Cartagena will start operating at the end of 2011.
The refining margin indicator for Spain, a measurement of the
profit from turning crude into fuels, widened to $3.30 a barrel
in the second quarter from $0.50 a barrel a year earlier, Repsol
said today.  
 Refining margins averaged $5.49 in the second quarter from
$3.08 in the first three months of the year, according to BP’s
Global Indicator Margin, a broad measure of the profitability of
turning crude in to fuels.  
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Europe’s largest oil company, also
reported earnings today, posting a 15 percent increase in
second-quarter profit helped by higher oil prices and
production. Crude prices averaged $78.05 a barrel in New York in
the three months ending June, an increase of 31 percent from a
year earlier.  
 Repsol on April 29 said it forecasts annual production
growth of as much as 4 percent through 2014 as projects in
Brazil and Peru come on stream. The company plans to invest 28.5
billion euros in the period.  
 Brazil Fields  
 It will develop the Guara and Piracuca fields in Brazil,
Kinteroni in Peru, Margarita-Huacaya in Bolivia, Cardon IV in
Venezuela and Reggane in Algeria, according to that plan. The
company has estimated a reserve replacement ratio of more than
110 percent in the next five years after reaching 94 percent in
2009.  
 On April 12 the company increased its estimate of gas
reserves at Venezuela’s Perla field by at least 30 percent after
drilling a new well at the deposit, the country’s biggest gas
discovery.  
 Repsol has stakes in blocks in Brazil’s Santos, Campos and
Espirito Santo basins and will invest as much as $5 billion
there between 2010 and 2014, and as much as $9 billion between
2015 and 2019.  
 Since 2007, Repsol and partners  BG Group Plc  and  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA  have found hydrocarbons in the offshore Carioca,
Guara and Iguacu fields in the Santos Basin’s BM-S-9 block.
These are ultra-deep deposits beneath a salt layer under the
seabed.  
 Tupi Fields  
 Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled oil company is
known, estimated in November 2007 that the Santos Basin’s pre-
salt Tupi field may have as many as 8 billion barrels of oil,
the largest find in the Americas since Mexico’s Cantarell field
in 1976. Repsol doesn’t own a stake in Tupi.  
 Repsol may sell a 40 percent stake in its Brazilian unit
through a capital increase and will consider options including
an initial public offering, Chief Executive Officer  Antonio Brufau  said on April 29. It will wait until a planned share sale
by  Petrobras  before taking a decision, he said that day.  
 Oil and gas production at Repsol’s upstream division, which
doesn’t include Argentine unit YPF, was unchanged from a year
earlier at 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the second
quarter. Output from Buenos Aires-based YPF, of which Repsol
owns 84 percent, fell 7 percent to 556,000 barrels a day as
fields matured.  
 YPF Holding  
 The Spanish company wants to sell part of its holding in
YPF “sooner rather than later,” Brufau said on April 29. The
shares may be sold to institutions or in the stock market and
Repsol will keep at least 51 percent of YPF, he said. In 2008
Repsol delayed a public offering of a stake in YPF.  
 Repsol  may raise about $3 billion from the sale of a 20
percent stake in YPF through a stock offering in Buenos Aires
and New York, Argentine investor  Sebastian Eskenazi  said May 19.
Eskenazi, whose family bought 15 percent of YPF from Repsol for
$2.2 billion in December 2007, expects to exercise an option to
boost the stake to 25 percent by 2012 this year.
