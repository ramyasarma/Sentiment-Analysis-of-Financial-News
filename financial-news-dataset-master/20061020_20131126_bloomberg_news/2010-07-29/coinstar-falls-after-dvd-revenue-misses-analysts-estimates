             Coinstar Inc. , owner of the Redbox
movie-rental kiosks, fell in extended trading after delayed
access to some new releases reduced second-quarter DVD revenue.  
 Sales rose 35 percent to $342.4 million, Bellevue,
Washington-based Coinstar said today in a statement. That was
less than the $381.3 million average of seven analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 DVD sales rose less than anticipated because of agreements
with three studios that delayed Redbox’s access to new releases
by 28 days early in the quarter. The deals ended legal battles
with News Corp.’s Twentieth Century Fox, General Electric Co.’s
NBC Universal and Time Warner Inc.’s Warner Bros.  
 “It did pull the top line down,” Chief Executive Officer
 Paul Davis  said on a conference call. “As we cycled through
this rotation and we started seeing new titles from the studios
every week, it started to improve.”  
 Coinstar tumbled $3.41, or 7.1 percent, to $44.68 in
extended  trading  after the results came out. The stock retreated
7 cents to $48.09 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading and has gained 49 percent this year.  
 The company also said it was accounting for its money-
transfer business as a discontinued operation, complicating
comparisons. Still, sales from DVD rentals fell short of
investor expectations,  Michael Pachter , an analyst at Wedbush
Securities in Los Angeles, said in an e-mail. He estimated the
money-transfer unit accounted for about half of the shortfall.  
 Blu-ray Discs  
 In a separate announcement, Coinstar said it has begun
stocking more than 13,000 kiosks with high-definition Blu-ray
versions of movies to rent for $1.50 a day. The company expects
to offer Blu-ray discs at all of its 23,000 locations the fourth
quarter, according to a statement.  
 Second-quarter revenue was within the company’s forecast
when the money-transfer and recently sold electronic payment
businesses are taken into account, Chief Financial Officer  Scott Di Valerio  said in an interview. The company has said it plans
to sell the money-transfer operation.  
 Profit this quarter will be 46 cents to 52 cents a share on
sales of $370 million to $390 million, Coinstar said. Analysts
were projecting 61 cents on sales of $406.5 million, the average
of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The company incurred additional expenses in the second
quarter because of the decision to drop the DVDXpress brand and
costs related to new movie supply agreements with Sony Corp. and
Viacom Inc.’s Paramount Pictures, according to the statement.  
 Net income increased to $13.4 million, or 41 cents a share,
from $6.96 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier, Coinstar said.
Excluding a gain, profit of 39 cents beat 33-cent average of
seven analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Coinstar is picking up customers as Blockbuster and Movie
Gallery close stores. Movie Gallery, based in Dothan, Alabama,
filed for bankruptcy protection in February and began closing
stores. Blockbuster, the largest movie-rental company, also has
closed outlets in the face of increased competition from Netflix
Inc.’s mail-order service and Redbox.
