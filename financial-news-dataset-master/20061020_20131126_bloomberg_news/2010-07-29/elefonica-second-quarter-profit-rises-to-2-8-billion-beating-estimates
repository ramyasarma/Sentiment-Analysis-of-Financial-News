             Telefonica SA , Europe’s second-
largest phone company, posted a better-than-expected 16 percent
gain in second-quarter profit on units in Latin America, where
it closed a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.8 billion) deal yesterday.  
 Net income  rose to 2.12 billion euros from 1.83 billion
euros a year earlier, Madrid-based  Telefonica  said today in a
regulatory filing. Analysts had predicted a 1.94 billion-euro
profit, the average of 13 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey . Sales
climbed 9 percent to 15.12 billion euros.  
 Chairman  Cesar Alierta  is expanding abroad to fuel growth
as revenue at home diminishes. The company agreed yesterday to
buy out  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA ’s stake in  Brasilcel NV , a
venture that controls Brazil’s biggest wireless operator. The
purchase will add to profit from the first year, it said.  
 Telefonica  rose 0.7 percent to 17.01 euros in Madrid
yesterday. The shares have fallen 13 percent so far this year,
more than the 0.7 percent decline in the 24-stock Bloomberg
Europe  Telecommunication  Services Index.  
 Sales from Telefonica’s Spanish division fell 3.2 percent
to 4.69 billion euros, while revenue elsewhere in Europe rose 14
percent to 3.79 billion euros. Sales at the  Latin American unit 
climbed 16 percent to 6.4 billion euros.  
 The company repeated its earnings and dividend goals in
today’s statement. Telefonica has pledged to pay a 2012  dividend 
of at least 1.75 euros per share.  
 Operating Income  
 Operating income before depreciation and amortization rose
4 percent to 5.79 billion euros. Analysts had predicted Oibda of
5.52 billion euros on sales of 14.53 billion euros, according to
the survey. Oibda as a percentage of sales fell to 38.3 percent
from 40.1 percent.  
 Alierta wants to have full control of Vivo to integrate the
wireless operator with Telefonica’s fixed-line unit
 Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA , or Telesp.  
 In local currency terms, Telesp posted a decline of 0.5
percent in second-quarter sales, with Oibda slumping 12 percent,
while Vivo sales grew 10 percent, boosting Oibda 10 percent.
