             A Spanish judge ordered the
detention of three U.S. soldiers accused of killing Spanish
cameraman  Jose Couso  in Iraq in 2003.  
 Judge Santiago Pedraz at Spain’s National Court ordered the
arrest of Sergeant Thomas Gibson, Captain Philip Wolford and
Lieutenant Colonel Philip de Camp, according to court documents.  
 The court offered to hear the soldiers’ defense in the
U.S., although American authorities haven’t cooperated, and the
relevant international arrest warrants will be activated, the
judge said. Pedraz said he would seek information on the men’s
whereabouts from Spanish police and intelligence agencies.  
 Couso was killed while filming with other reporters in the
Palestine Hotel in Baghdad on April 8, 2003, the court said.
Spanish law allows courts to pursue crimes including terrorism
and crimes against humanity in other countries if they have a
Spanish connection.  
 A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Madrid declined to
immediately comment.
