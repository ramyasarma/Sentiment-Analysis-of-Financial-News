             Argentina’s  unemploymen t rate fell
to the lowest in more than a year in the second quarter as
economic growth picked up, President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said.  
 The jobless rate was 7.9 percent in the three months
through June, down from 8.8 percent a year earlier, Fernandez
said today in Buenos Aires. It’s the lowest unemployment rate
since the end of 2008.  
 “This reveals the vigorous  growth  we are having,”
Fernandez said at the presidential palace, where she signed loan
accords with the Corporacion Andina de Fomento, the Andean
development lender.  
 The economy, South America’s second largest after Brazil,
is recovering from a slump that cut economic growth to 0.9
percent in 2009, the slowest rate since Argentina pulled out of
a recession in 2003. Gross domestic product rose 6.8 percent in
the first quarter, the fastest annual pace since 2008.  
 The national statistics institute is scheduled to release
the second-quarter unemployment report Aug. 23.
