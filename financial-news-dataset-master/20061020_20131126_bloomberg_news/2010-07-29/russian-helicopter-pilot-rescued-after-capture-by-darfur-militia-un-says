             A Russian helicopter pilot with the
 United Nations  and African Union joint peacekeeping mission in
the Darfur region of Sudan was rescued today after being seized
and beaten by a militia group, the UN said.  
 The United Nations worked with Sudanese government
intelligence officials to locate the pilot, spokesman  Farhan Haq 
said in New York. The pilot was then picked up at a designated
location and returned safely by helicopter to the town of Nyala,
the capital of South Darfur, Haq said.  
 The pilot was transporting three commanders of the Liberty
and Justice Movement, a Darfur rebel group, when he landed his
helicopter on July 26 in an undesignated area due to bad weather
outside Nyala. The rebel commanders were on their way to Doha,
the Qatari capital, to participate in peace talks with the
Sudanese government, said Chris Cycmanick, a spokesman for the
UN in Sudan.  
 The helicopter, operated by Utair, Russia’s fifth-largest
airline, provides services for the joint UN-AU peacekeeping
mission in Darfur, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a
statement on its website.  
 Darfur has been the scene of conflict between the
government and rebel groups since 2003. As many as 300,000
people have died, mainly due to illness and starvation,
according to UN estimates. Sudanese President  Umar al-Bashir ’s
government puts the death toll at about 10,000.
