             Standard Bank Plc advised selling
the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc, with an estimate for
the European currency to appreciate to 1.0150.  
 Standard Bank started the recommendation with the franc at
1.0510 against the U.S. currency, and said investors should end
the bet if it weakens to 1.0750,  Steve Barrow , head of Group-
of-10 foreign-exchange research in London, said today in an
investor note.  
 The franc strengthened 0.9 percent to 1.0471 versus the
dollar as of 10:48 a.m. in London.  
 Barrow also recommended investors buy the Australian dollar
against the New Zealand dollar at 1.24, betting it will
strengthen to 1.2680. The Aussie dollar gained 1 percent to
1.2404.
