             Gold may advance on speculation that
recent price declines will spur increased physical and
investment demand, a survey found.  
 Nine of 22 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 41 percent, said bullion will rise next week.
Eight forecast lower prices and five were neutral. Gold for
December delivery was down 2.1 percent this week at $1,166.60 an
ounce at 11:11 a.m. yesterday on the Comex in New York.  
 The metal has dropped 7.9 percent since climbing to a
record $1,266.50 on June 21. Prices on July 28 slipped to a 12-
week low of $1,159.30 as holdings in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the
biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped the most in
more than two years. Physical demand for gold from India, China
and the wider Asian region was “very visible” as prices
declined this week, UBS AG said July 28.  
 “Although gold has fallen sharply from the highs reached
in June we believe gold will still head higher,” said  Walter de Wet , an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in London. “While we are
seeing strong physical demand for gold already, we believe
investment demand for gold will remain in place.”  
 Bullion has fallen from its high on reduced European
financial turmoil and on signs the global economy is rebounding.
The euro yesterday climbed to a 12-week high against the dollar,
while the MSCI World Index of equities this week advanced to the
highest level since May 14. Gold is up 6.4 percent this year.  
 The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling that most respondents expect a
decline. The green line shows the gold price. The data shown are
as of July 23.  
 The weekly gold survey that started six years ago has
forecast prices accurately in 183 of 321 weeks, or 57 percent of
the time.  
 This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 9  Bearish : 8  Neutral : 5
