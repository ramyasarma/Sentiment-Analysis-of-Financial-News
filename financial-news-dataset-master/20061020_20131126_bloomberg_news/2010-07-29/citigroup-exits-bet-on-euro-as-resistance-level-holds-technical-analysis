             Citigroup Inc. is abandoning its
long position on the euro “for now” after the currency failed
to rise above a key technical resistance level.  
 The shared currency rallied today to $1.3107, the strongest
level in almost three months, stopping short of advancing beyond
a range of $1.3080 to $1.3115.  
 The range represents a “plethora of resistance” that the
euro has faced in the past 18 months, analysts led by New York-
based  Tom Fitzpatrick  said in a note to clients. A long position
is a bet that the price of an asset will rise.  
 “We have been trying to push through those levels all
morning without success,” Fitzpatrick wrote. “As a
consequence, we are going to exit our recent euro-dollar long
here at $1.3071.”  
 The euro appreciated 0.7 percent to $1.3081 at 2:52 p.m. in
New York, from $1.2995 yesterday. Citigroup will re-establish
its long euro position if the currency falls further or if it
closes above $1.3115.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A resistance level is an area on a
chart where orders to sell a currency versus a counterpart may
be placed, potentially blocking an advance.
