             Cotton rose to the highest price
this month on concern that hot, dry weather will damage U.S.
crops in the Mississippi River Delta and Southeast. Orange-juice
futures also rallied.  
 Temperatures across the Delta, the biggest U.S. growing
region after Texas, were as much as 4 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal in the past two weeks, said Kyle Tapley, a meteorologist
at MDA EarthSat Weather Inc. in Rockville, Maryland. Rainfall
was less than the average from Jackson, Mississippi, to Memphis,
Tennessee, he said. The U.S. is the world’s top exporter.  
 “The cotton crop in the southeastern U.S. is melting,”
said  Keith Brown , the president of Keith Brown & Co., a
brokerage in Moultrie, Georgia. “A few weeks ago, the crop was
excellent, but God Almighty has turned off the faucets.”  
 Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.6 cent, or 0.8
percent, to close at 76.91 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached 77.44
cents, the highest level for a most-active contract since June
30. The fiber has rallied 5.4 percent since reaching a five-
month low on July 20.  
 In the Delta, rainfall in the past two weeks totaled 1.75
inches (4.4 centimeters) in Jackson, down 0.42 inch, or 20
percent less than a 30-year average, according to MD EarthSat
data. Rainfall in Memphis was 0.6 inch, or 68 percent less than
the average.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery gained 0.7
cent, or 0.5 percent, to close at $1.462 a pound at 2 p.m. in
New York.
