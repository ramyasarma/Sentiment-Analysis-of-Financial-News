             MetLife Inc. , the  biggest  U.S. life
insurer, swung to a second-quarter profit as revenue rose and
the company booked an investment gain on derivatives. The stock
advanced 2.8 percent in extended New York trading.  
 Second-quarter  net income  was $1.56 billion, or $1.84 a
share, compared with a loss of $1.4 billion, or $1.74, in the
year-earlier period, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. Operating profit, which excludes some investment
results, was $1.23 a share, compared with the average $1
estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Robert Henrikson  is adding
customers in the U.S. as  profits return  and bailed-out rivals
such as American International Group Inc. scale back their
offerings. MetLife’s business outside the U.S. is poised to
increase when the firm completes its $15.5 billion acquisition
of an AIG unit with sales in Japan, Russia and Poland.  
 “They’re growing their revenues because it’s still part of
the flight to quality,”  Steven Schwartz , an analyst with
Raymond James & Associates Inc., said in an interview before
results were released. “They’re the biggest dog in the pound.”  
 MetLife advanced $1.11 to $41.31 at 4:23 p.m. in extended
trading after ending the session on the New York Stock Exchange
up 2.3 percent. The company  gained  about 25 percent in the 12
months through the end of regular trading today.  
 Investment Gain  
 MetLife posted a $767 million after-tax net investment
gain, compared with a $2.6 billion loss in the same period a
year ago. Premiums, fees and other revenue rose 3.7 percent to
$8.68 billion, the insurer said.  
 Book value per share, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, climbed 10 percent from March 31 to $45.51 on June
30 as unrealized gains jumped to $7.3 billion from $1.5 billion
at the end of the first quarter. Unrealized gains, reflecting
market fluctuations that aren’t counted toward earnings, are
monitored by investors and rating firms as a gauge of financial
strength.  
 MetLife posted a 10 percent increase in the sale of equity-
linked retirement products last year as New York-based AIG and
 Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.  retreated. Variable
annuity sales at MetLife rose to $15.4 billion in 2009, while
AIG fell 42 percent to $4.8 billion and Hartford, based in the
Connecticut city of the same name, plummeted 66 percent to $2.7
billion, according to data from trade group Limra International.  
 Investments  
 Net investment income gained 9.6 percent to $4.09 billion.
MetLife said it got a “strong performance” from private equity
holdings, which contributed to $296 million in so-called
variable investment income, a category of holdings that include
hedge funds.  
 Premiums, fees and other revenues in the U.S. rose about 2
percent to $7.2 billion on a gain in retirement products.
International revenue rose about 21 percent to $1.2 billion on
improvements in Mexico, India and South Korea.  
 Operating revenue at MetLife Bank fell about 16 percent to
$337 million on lower mortgage refinancing, the company said.  
 American Life Insurance Co., the AIG unit that Henrikson
agreed in March to acquire, will make about  $2.4 billion  in
profits in 2010, MetLife has projected. MetLife’s pretax income
from international businesses was $624 million last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 MetLife has said it plans to sell $2 billion in common
stock and $3.1 billion of senior debt to fund the deal. MetLife
recorded revenue of $5.5 billion outside the U.S. in 2009,
compared with $42.1 billion in its home market.  
 Derivatives  
 Derivatives results, which count toward the investment
gain, swung to a profit from a $1.8 billion loss in the second
quarter of 2009, when the insurer recorded a $1 billion charge
tied to a narrowing of its credit spreads.  
 In the second quarter this year, MetLife’s credit spreads
widened. According to accounting rules, insurers reduce the
value of liabilities when their credit deteriorate, said Jay
Hanson, partner and national director of accounting at McGladrey
& Pullen LLP.  
 Credit-default swaps on MetLife soared to 335 basis points
as of June 30 from 193 basis points on March 31, the biggest
percentage change since the third quarter of 2008.

                          July 29 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg's David Evans talks about New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's fraud probe into the life insurance industry.
     Cuomo's office subpoenaed Prudential Financial Inc. and MetLife Inc. for information about profits on death benefits retained from the families of deceased policyholders including military personnel. Cuomo’s investigation was prompted by a Bloomberg Markets magazine report and follows a review by the New York State Insurance Department. Evans speaks with Margaret Brennan and Scarlet Fu on Bloomberg Television's "InBusiness". (Source: Bloomberg)
