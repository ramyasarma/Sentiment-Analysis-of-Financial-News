             Electricite de France SA , Europe’s
biggest power producer, will raise the estimated costs of
developing its EPR nuclear reactor at Flamanville in France to
about 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion) and delay the planned
start, according to two people with knowledge of the project.  
 EDF has previously said France’s first EPR will cost 4
billion euros and start commercial operations in 2013. The
people asked not to be identified because the information isn’t
public.  
 The cost overrun and delay was first reported by LCI
television earlier today. An EDF spokeswoman declined to
comment.  
 EDF is building a 1,650-megawatt,  Areva SA -designed EPR at
Flamanville and plans similar models in the U.K. and the U.S.
and has started constructing reactors in China. Areva is also
developing an EPR in Finland which is over budget and behind
schedule.
