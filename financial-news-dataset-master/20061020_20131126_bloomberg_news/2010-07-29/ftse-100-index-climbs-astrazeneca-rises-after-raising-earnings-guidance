             U.K. stocks  were little changed as
 Unilever Plc  led a decline in consumer goods stocks, offsetting
a rally by  AstraZeneca Plc .  
 Unilever fell 2.4 percent as U.S. rival Colgate-Palmolive
Co.’s sales missed analysts’ estimates and Kellogg Co. said that
its recall of 28 million boxes of cereal last month will lower
earnings this year. AstraZeneca surged to its highest level
since 2006 after winning a U.S. panel’s backing to sell its
experimental blood-thinner Brilinta.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  slipped 0.1 percent to
5,313.95 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge is 8.8
percent below this year’s high on April 15 amid concern that
growth will be curbed by austerity measures from European
governments. Economic reports in the U.S. and China have also
disappointed investors. The  FTSE All-Share Index  was little
changed at 2,744.3 and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  fell less than 0.1
percent at 2,910.75.  
 Unilever, the world’s second-biggest consumer goods maker,
dropped 2.4 percent to 1,821 pence, its fifth consecutive loss.
Two of the company’s largest U.S. rivals reported worse-than-
expected revenue today.  
 Colgate-Palmolive’s shares fell the most in almost two
years after the world’s biggest toothpaste maker reported
second-quarter sales of $3.81 billion that missed the $3.96
billion median estimate of 18 analysts’ surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Kellogg, the largest U.S. maker of breakfast cereal,
reduced its net income forecast for the year after recalling
cereals such as Froot Loops and Apple Jacks last month. Full-
year per-share profit will climb as much as 10 percent, compared
with a previous top range of 13 percent, Kellogg said today in a
statement.  
 BHP, Rio Tinto Fall  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. fell 0.7 percent to 1,977.5 pence, while
Rio Tinto Group slumped 1 percent to 3,355 pence, the stock’s
first loss in nine days.  
 AstraZeneca surged 2.7 percent to 3,289 pence, reaching its
highest price since October 2006, after outside advisers to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted 7-1 today in favor of
Brilinta’s use in people who are having surgery or nonsurgical
procedures to manage chest pain or earlier heart attacks.  
 The U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker also reported net
income that beat estimates, raised its earnings forecast for the
third time this year and doubled a share buyback plan.  
 BAE Systems Plc , Europe’s largest defense company, climbed
1 percent, its seventh gain in eight days. It had net income of
618 million pounds ($963.7 million) in the first half, compared
with a year-earlier loss of 82 million pounds. Sales rose 9.2
percent to 10.6 billion pounds.  
 Reed Elsevier Plc , the publisher of Variety magazine,
increased 3.8 percent to 552 pence. The company said first-half
net income rose to 316 million pounds from 161 million pounds a
year earlier.  
 BT Group Plc  rose 3.5 percent to 144.8 pence. Britain’s
biggest fixed-line phone company said first-quarter operating
profit climbed 5.5 percent, helped by job cuts.
