             SPI (Australia) Assets Ltd., a unit
of  Singapore Power Ltd. , hired Commonwealth Bank of Australia
and Westpac Banking Corp. to help it sell five-year bonds.  
 The Australian dollar-denominated notes will be priced in
the near future, Commonwealth Bank said in an e-mailed statement
today, without being more specific.  
 SPI (Australia) told investors it may price the bonds to
yield between 180 basis points and 185 basis points more than
the swap rate, said a person familiar with the matter, who asked
not to be named as the information is private.  
 The borrower owns the Jemena gas and electricity pipeline
business, according to Singapore Power’s  website . A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.
