             Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. , the world’s largest custom manufacturer of chips, posted a
65 percent increase in profit on rising demand for components in
phones and computers.  
 Second-quarter net income climbed to NT$40.3 billion ($1.3
billion), from NT$24.4 billion a year earlier, the Hsinchu,
Taiwan-based company said in a statement today. The average of
19 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of
NT$36.5 billion.  
 Taiwan Semiconductor, an electronics bellwether because it
supplies companies including  Apple Inc.  and Sony Corp., has
twice raised its 2010 outlook for the global chip industry. TSMC
joins  Intel Corp.  and Samsung Electronics Co., the two largest
chipmakers, in posting record profit from semiconductors as the
global economy rebounds and consumers in emerging markets buy
more electronic devices.  
 “Shipments jumped in the second quarter, indicating strong
end-market demand for consumer electronics during the
traditional low season,”  Amigo Liu , who rates TSMC
“outperform” at KGI Securities Co. in Taipei wrote in a report
today before the announcement. “In the third quarter, shipments
will continue to grow due to rising orders from major
international handset manufacturers.”
