             Canada’s dollar strengthened for the
first time in three days as higher-than-forecast U.S. corporate
profits boosted optimism the economic recovery is strengthening.  
 “Overall risk sentiment remains well into risk-seeking
territory,”  David Watt , senior currency strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit, said in an e-mail
today.  
 The Canadian currency gained 0.5 percent to C$1.0337 per
U.S. dollar at 10:27 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0388
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 96.74 U.S. cents.  
 The S&P 500 Index gained 0.3 percent at 10:27 a.m. in New
York, after dropping 0.7 percent yesterday. The gauge has
climbed 7.3 percent in July, headed for its best monthly advance
in a year, as more than 80 percent of its companies that have
reported so far posted second-quarter results that topped
analysts’ estimates.  
 Futures on crude oil, the nation’s largest export, rose 0.5
percent to $77.32. Canada’s dollar tends to track movements in
stocks and commodity prices  
 The Canadian dollar, known as the loonie for the aquatic
bird on the one-dollar coin, is poised for a 3 percent gain
against the greenback in July and has risen 2 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg data.  
 Rival Currencies  
 The loonie lagged behind 10 of its 16 most-traded
currencies this month. The Canadian currency fell 3.82 versus
the euro since June 30. It has depreciated 1.72 against the
pound.  
 Canada’s currency was little changed after a government
report showed factory product prices dropped in June the most in
more than a year, faster than a decline in raw-material costs.  
 The industrial product price index fell 0.9 percent in June
from May, the most since May 2009, Ottawa-based Statistics
Canada said. Primary metal prices fell 2.9 percent and petroleum
and coal prices fell 2.3 percent. The figures suggest that
factory profit margins narrowed in June.  
 For the 12 months ending in June, industrial prices rose
0.2 percent, the second such increase after more than a year of
declines, the report said. The raw materials index fell 0.1
percent during that time, the first drop after seven prior
gains.
