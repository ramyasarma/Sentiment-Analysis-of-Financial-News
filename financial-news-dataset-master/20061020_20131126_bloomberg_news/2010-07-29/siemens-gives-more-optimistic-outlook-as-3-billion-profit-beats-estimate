             Siemens AG , Europe’s largest
engineering company, said profit rose 40 percent as job cuts and
cost savings combined with a rebound in demand for factory
automation gear, health-care products and light bulbs.  
 Sector profit, or operating income at Siemens’s energy,
health-care and industry divisions, was 2.33 billion euros
($3.03 billion) in the  quarter  ended June 30, compared with 1.67
billion euros a year earlier, the Munich-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey estimated
2.14 billion euros. Orders rose 22 percent to 20.87 billion
euros, compared with the survey’s 19.1 billion-euro prediction.  
 Net income  rose 12 percent to 1.41 billion euros, the
company said.  
 Siemens is scheduled to bring an end to a program that
placed as many as 19,000 workers on shorter shifts as factories
 grappled  with lower demand during the financial crisis.
Germany’s VDMA machine makers’ association, which had predicted
stagnant output this year, switched to a growth forecast of 3
percent on July 20 following a surge in May.  
 The German maker of trains, turbines and body scanners has
advanced about 20 percent this year in Frankfurt trading, for a
 market value  of more than 70 billion euros. That compares with
 General Electric Co. ’s 6.9 percent gain.  
 Spurred by growth in emerging markets and a recovery in
short-cycle businesses such as light bulbs, Siemens raised its
outlook for full-year earnings on April 29. By contrast, delays
to power-plant projects and big-ticket investment programs are
hampering orders for turbines. Sales this year will  decline  in a
mid-single-digit percentage range, Siemens has said.  
 Siemens cut about 16,000 jobs in the 15 months though March
and Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher  is in the process of
cutting 4,900 jobs, or 15 percent of employees, at its industry
solutions division by 2011.  
 Both GE and  Alstom SA , the world’s third-largest power-
equipment maker, have suffered from fewer orders among customers
in the power industry.  Royal Philips Electronics NV , the world’s
biggest lighting company, forecast sales growth will slow in the
second half.
