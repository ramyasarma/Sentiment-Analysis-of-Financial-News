             Covidien Plc.  won its bid to reverse
a $58 million damage award to  Becton, Dickinson & Co.  over a
patent related to safety needles.  
 A federal appeals court today said the trial judge erred in
his interpretation of the patent and should have ruled that
Dublin-based Covidien, the medical-equipment company spun off
from Tyco International Ltd., didn’t infringe the patent.  
 “We’re analyzing the opinion and considering our
options,”  Colleen White , a spokeswoman for Franklin Lakes, New
Jersey-based Becton, said in an interview.  
 The dispute focused on hypodermic needles that have a guard
to prevent people from getting accidentally stuck. The opinion
from the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Federal Circuit was
posted on the court’s  website .  
 The needle shields are used with one hand, and slide
forward after use to cover the tip and avoid accidental
“sticks” that might transmit AIDS or hepatitis through the
blood to medical workers.  
 “We are pleased with the court’s decision,” Lisa
Clemence, a Covidien spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.
“Our priority continues to be to ensure that our customers
receive the very best in needle safety protection.”  
 Covidien fell $1.53, or 4 percent, to $36.98 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading at 2:07 p.m. The shares have
dropped 23 percent this year. Becton fell 83 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $67.50 on the NYSE, bringing the year’s decline to
14 percent.  
 The original case is Becton, Dickinson & Co. v. Tyco
Healthcare Group LP, 02-CV-1694, U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware (Wilmington). The appeals case is Becton,
Dickinson & Co. v. Tyco Healthcare Group LP, 2009-1053,-1111,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington).
