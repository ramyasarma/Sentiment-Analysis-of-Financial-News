             Copper, up 11 percent this month in
London, may rise next week as investors allot more money to
commodities, according to a survey.  
 Eleven of 21 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 52 percent, said the metal will gain next week.
Eight predicted lower prices and two forecast little change.
Copper for delivery in three months was up 3.2 percent for this
week at $7,255 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 3:45
p.m. yesterday.  
 Hedge funds and other large speculators boosted their net-
long position, or bets on higher prices, for New York copper
futures to 3,915 contracts as of July 20 from 2,862 contracts on
June 29, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data. Investors put $15.4 billion of new money into raw
materials in the second quarter, up from the prior three months,
Barclays Capital said July 16.  
 “We would not be surprised to see fresh money hitting
commodities as we head into August, given the rally seen so far
in July,”  Randy North , a trader at RBC Capital Markets in
London, wrote in a report yesterday. “This buying, in turn,
will likely trigger further technically driven buying.”  
 The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of July 23.  
 The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
47 of the past 97 weeks, or 48 percent of the time.  
 This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 11  Bearish : 8 Hold: 2
