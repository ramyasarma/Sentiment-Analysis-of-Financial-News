             Buck Showalter was hired as manager
of the Baltimore Orioles, putting the former field boss of the
New York Yankees in charge of the team with Major League
Baseball’s worst record, the Baltimore Sun said.  
 Showalter, 54, was chosen after protracted negotiations,
the Sun said, citing two unidentified people. The Orioles are
31-70 and 33 1/2 games behind the first-place Yankees in the
American League East.  
 Mick McDonald, an Orioles spokesman, declined to confirm
the report.
