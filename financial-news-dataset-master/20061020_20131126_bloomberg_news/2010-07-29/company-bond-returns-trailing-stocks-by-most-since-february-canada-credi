             Returns on Canada’s corporate bonds
are trailing gains in stocks this month by the most since
February, as rising company profits lure investors to equities.  
 Debt investors have lost 0.44 percent on average in July,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Canadian Corporate
Index, while the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  has
gained 3.6 percent. Declines this month are being led by St.
John’s, Newfoundland-based electric utility Fortis Inc., whose
bonds have lost 1.76 percent, and Epcor Utilities Inc., which is
down 1.59 percent.  
 Investors are pulling money out of bonds and putting it
into stocks as the earnings at the more than 80 percent of
companies in the S&P 500 that have reported second-quarter
results so far top analysts’ estimates, and per-share profit has
grown 54 percent, according to Bloomberg data. Canada’s
government may say tomorrow that the economy accelerated in May,
according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg News.  
 “The capital markets have gone from basically a risk-off
mode back to a risk-on mode, so bonds have lost some of their
appeal to equities,” said  Sheldon Dong , a vice-president of
fixed-income strategy at Toronto Dominion Bank’s TD Securities
unit in Toronto.  
 Diverging Returns  
 The 4 percentage-point difference in returns between bonds
and stocks is the most since company debt trailed the
performance of equities by 4.58 percentage points in February.
Bonds are still doing better for the year, returning 3.96
percent, compared with a decline of 0.42 percent for the  S&P/TSX 
index.  
 Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own corporate bonds rather than the nation’s
government debt rose to 151 basis points yesterday from 142 on
July 27, according to the Merrill Lynch index. The spread
averaged 149 basis points, or 1.49 percentage point, at the end
of June.  
 Also, the province of Ontario increased the size of its 4.2
percent bond set to mature in 2020 by C$750 million ($722
million) to C$4.35 billion. It was the second time in a month
the province lifted the size of the deal by that much.  
 Telus Corp.  said it will redeem early $613 million, or 45
percent, of a $1.36 billion note due in 2011. The Vancouver-
based telecommunications company said it will fund the
redemption, set for Sept. 2, with the proceeds from its C$1
billion of 5.05 percent 10-year notes issued last week and from
other credit.  
 Government Bonds  
 In the government bond market, the yield on the benchmark
3.5 percent bond due in June 2020 fell 3 basis points to 3.23
percent as its price rose.  
 The spread between the Canadian government 2- and 10-year
bond yields held steady at 1.63 percentage points, after
expanding from 1.51 percentage points, the slimmest margin based
on closing prices since December 2008, on July 9.  
 Canadian home resale prices rose for a 13th straight month
in May, the longest streak since September 2006, the  Teranet-
National Bank  Composite House Price Index showed yesterday.
Overall prices rose 13.6 percent from May 2009. The index has
tracked home-price changes in six Canadian cities -- Calgary,
Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver -- since
February 2000.  
 GDP Forecasts  
 The nation’s  gross domestic product  rose 0.2 percent in
May, after stalling in April, Statistics Canada is likely to say
on July 30, according to the median of 21 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  
 Canadian corporate bonds are also lagging behind their
global counterparts. Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market
Corporate Index gained 0.7 percent this month.  
 Bonds lost some of their appeal after the Bank of Canada
raised its  benchmark interest rate  on July 22 to 0.75 percent,
the second increase in a row, and said its forecast includes
“gradual” increases in borrowing costs. Government benchmark
bond yields have climbed from one-year lows as their prices fell
amid signs that the economic recovery won’t falter.  
 “Because the Canada yields have moved up, it’s caused some
spread compression,” TD Securities’ Dong said. Even so,
“there’s no loss of appetite for companies; look at that Air
Canada deal,” he said.  
 The country’s largest airline sold $1.09 billion of high-
yield debt to repay an existing loan and for general purposes.
The notes brought total high-yield debt sales in Canada this
year close to the record C$1.8 billion reached in 2007, said
 Robert Follis , head of corporate research at the Bank of Nova
Scotia.  
 Air Canada issued $600 million of five-year notes that
yielded 9.5 percent and C$300 million of debt of the same
maturity that yielded 10.375 percent, Bloomberg data show. The
company also sold $200 million of 5.5-year debt that pays 13
percent.  
 “Investors are still clamoring for yield,” Dong said.
“If they can get over 10 percent, there’s buyers out there.”
