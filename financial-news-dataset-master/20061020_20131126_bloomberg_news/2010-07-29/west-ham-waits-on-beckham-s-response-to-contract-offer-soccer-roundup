             The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  
 Hammers Wait  
 West Ham is waiting for  David Beckham  to respond to a
contract offer from the east London club,  the Sun reported .  
 The 35-year-old former England captain has promised to give
every consideration to the possibility of a return to the
Premier League, the Sun quoted West Ham co-owner David Gold
as saying.  
 Beckham is recovering from an Achilles injury and
is likely to make his comeback in the next few weeks before
returning to play in Europe in January, the newspaper added.  
 Young Doubt  
 Liverpool’s move for Aston Villa’s  Luke Young  may stall on
the defender’s demands of a pay-off,  the Daily Mirror reported .  
 The Reds have offered the 31-year-old a contract less than
his current deal and Young wants Villa to make up some of the
difference with a “golden good bye,” the Mirror said.  
 Tottenham Eyes Bellamy  
 Tottenham will offer just 4 million pounds ($6.3 million)
for Manchester City striker  Craig Bellamy  because  Roberto Mancini  needs to shed players before the new season, the  Daily
Mail said.   
 New Premier League rules mean squads must be limited to 25
players leaving several first-team players at City in danger of
missing the cut, the newspaper said.  
 Manchester City paid 14 million pounds for Bellamy in
January 2009.  
 Petrov Move?  
 Liverpool coach  Roy Hodgson  is considering a move for Aston
Villa midfielder  Stilian Petrov  as a replacement for  Javier Mascherano , who has asked to leave,  the Daily Mirror said .  
 Hodgson is willing to pay about 7 million pounds to land
the 30-year-old Bulgarian, the newspaper said.  
 Hughes at Fulham  
 Mark Hughes  has agreed to become the new Fulham manager,
the  Guardian reported .  
 The former Manchester City boss will join the Cottagers
after owner  Mohamed Al Fayed  said there would be funds to
recruit new players, the Guardian said.  
 A raid on former club City for strikers Craig Bellamy and
 Roque Sante Cruz  may be Hughes’s first move, the newspaper added.  
 Frustrated Parker  
 West Ham midfielder  Scott Parker  has been left frustrated
by his team’s decision to reject a 7 million-pound transfer
offer from Tottenham,  the Guardian reported .  
 The 29-year-old wants to consider a move to the north
London team, which plays its first season in the Champions
League, the newspaper said.
