             Gold futures rose the most in a week
as a slide by the dollar boosted the appeal of the precious
metal as an alternative asset.  
 The greenback fell to a  three-month low  against a basket of
six major currencies after a report signaled the U.S. labor
market will be slow to recover. Gold generally moves in the
opposite direction of the dollar and has gained 26 percent in
the past year, reaching a record $1,266.50 an ounce on June 21.  
 “Gold is trading off the dollar,” said  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. “The dollar’s
getting whacked, and that’s helping gold.”  
 Gold futures for December delivery rose $8.80, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $1,171.20 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, the biggest gain for the most-active contract
since July 20.  
 The euro gained as much as 0.9 percent against the dollar,
topping $1.31 for the first time in almost three months, on
speculation that Europe’s economy may recover faster than the
U.S. A Labor Department report showed limited employment gains
as U.S. initial jobless claims dropped by 11,000 in the week
ended July 24 from a revised 468,000.  
 Gold also rose to records last month in euros, U.K. pounds
and Swiss francs amid Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. Today’s
gains for the metal may be limited because some investors may
still be selling gold and buying euros, analysts said.  
 “Gold and the euro are not moving in sync yet,” said
 Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services
LLC in Chicago.  
 Confidence Gains  
 Reports showed European confidence in the economic outlook
rose this month to the highest level in more than two years, and
German unemployment decreased.  
 “We don’t have that currency fear out there,” Lesh of
FuturePath said. “We just don’t have that push that will propel
gold much higher at the moment.”  
 The outlook for gold remains “positive,” even as
investors are less concerned that European governments will
struggle to reduce debt,  Jamie Sokalsky , the chief financial
officer of Barrick Gold Corp., said today on a conference call
with investors.  
 “Sovereign-debt issues around the world aren’t likely to
go away in the foreseeable future,” Sokalsky said. “The main
drivers of investment demand, and hence, higher gold prices, are
still in place.”  
 Precious metals with wider industrial applications gained
on speculation that demand for raw materials will pick up as the
global economy recovers.  
 Silver futures for September delivery rose 17.6 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $17.617 an ounce at 2:01 p.m.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery gained $21.70, or 1.4
percent, to close at $1,563.40 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1,568.60,
a one-month high.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery advanced $22.45,
or 4.8 percent, to settle at $491.20 an ounce at 1:40 p.m.
Earlier, the metal reached $492.75, the highest level since June
22.
