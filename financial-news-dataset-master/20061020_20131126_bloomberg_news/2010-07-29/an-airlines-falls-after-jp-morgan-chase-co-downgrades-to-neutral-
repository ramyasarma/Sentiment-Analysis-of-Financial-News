             Lan Airlines SA , Latin America’s
largest airline by market value, fell the most in four weeks as
 JPMorgan Chase & Co.  cut its rating to “neutral,” saying
growth potential is mostly reflected in the stock price.  
 Lan fell 0.9 percent to 11,942 pesos, the biggest decline
since July 1. Chile’s  IPSA index  rose 0.1 percent to 4,357.21.
Lan was the most-active stock in Santiago trading, with 16.6
billion pesos changing hands, according to the exchange.  
 The airline’s second-quarter results missed JPMorgan’s
“aggressive” estimates, analysts  Brian Chase ,  Jamie Baker  and
 Scott Tan  said in an e-mailed note, lowering the stock from
“overweight.”  
 “The recovery/growth outlook appears largely priced in,”
the analysts said. Lan is up 38 percent this year compared with
the MSCI Chile Index’s 14 percent gain.
