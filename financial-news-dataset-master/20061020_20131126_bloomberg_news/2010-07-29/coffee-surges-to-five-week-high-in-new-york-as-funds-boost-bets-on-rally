             Coffee jumped, closing at the
highest price in 12 years, as hedge funds boosted purchases and
the dollar’s slump enhanced the allure of commodities. Cocoa
also gained.  
 The  greenback  fell to a three-month low against a basket of
six major currencies. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw
materials surged to the highest level since May 5. In the week
ended July 20,  net-long positions  held by hedge-fund managers
and other large speculators in New York coffee futures rose for
the sixth straight week to the highest level since March 2008.  
 “The market broke through $1.70, and that triggered a lot
of buying from speculators and funds,” said Hernando de la
Roche, a director at Hencorp Futures in Miami.  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery surged 5.65 cents, or
3.4 percent, to close at $1.7305 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the highest settlement for a most-
active contract since Feb. 23, 1998. This year, the price has
gained 27 percent, the most among CRB components.  
 Earlier, coffee reached $1.746, the highest intraday price
since June 24. On that date, the commodity climbed to a 12-year
high of $1.765.  
 “The dollar is falling, giving commodities a boost in
general,” said  Fain Shaffer , the president of Infinity Trading
Corp in Medford, Oregon.  
 Arabica prices in Brazil, the world’s biggest producer,
will stay near a five-year high as rising demand outpaces
supply, according to Cepea, a research group at the University
of Sao Paulo.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, robusta-coffee futures for
September delivery gained $26, or 1.5 percent, to close at
$1,747 a metric ton at 5:30 p.m. local time.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery climbed $36, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $3,046 a ton at 12:03 p.m. in New York.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery rose 15 pounds, or 0.7
percent, to close at 2,286 pounds ($3,570) a ton at 4:50 p.m. in
London.
