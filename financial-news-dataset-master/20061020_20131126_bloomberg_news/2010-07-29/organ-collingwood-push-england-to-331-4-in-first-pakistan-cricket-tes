             An unbeaten 213-run stand from  Eoin Morgan  and  Paul Collingwood  lifted England to 331-4 on the
opening day of the first cricket Test against Pakistan.  
 England, which won the toss and elected to bat, slumped to
118-4 at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Morgan was on 125 at
stumps, recording his first Test century with a six in the 80th
over. Collingwood is 81 not out.  
 England captain  Andrew Strauss  scored 45 before edging to
Kamran Akmal off Mohammad Aamer as the host reached 103-2 at
lunch. Aamer was 2-28 in the morning session.  
 Pakistan responded after the break as  Mohammad Asif  bowled
out  Kevin Pietersen  and  Jonathan Trott  was out leg-before-wicket
against Aamer four balls later.  
 Morgan and Collingwood then took over as England reached
190-4 at tea. Morgan was ruled out lbw on 78 in the 73rd over
but the call was overturned on review, allowing him to reach the
century mark seven overs later.
