             South African antitrust authorities
recommended airlines, including  British Airways Plc  and
 Singapore Airlines Ltd. , be fined for fixing the price of fuel
surcharges and rates on cargo flown in and out of the country.  
 The Competition Commission recommended yesterday that the
allegations against the airlines be referred to the nation’s
Competition Tribunal, which will consider the case for
prosecution, the Pretoria-based commission said in an e-mailed
statement today.  
 South African Airways,  Air France-KLM ,  Alitalia SpA ,
Cargolux Airlines International SA, Martinair Holland NV and
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG  also face charges, the commission said.  
 Investigators have asked the Competition Tribunal to impose
a fine of 10 percent of the annual local turnover on each of the
airlines involved, except Lufthansa which was granted immunity
from prosecution on condition it co-operates with authorities,
the commission said.  
 “In its application Lufthansa admitted that various
surcharges and price increases were agreed upon with its
competitors and it was granted conditional immunity from
prosecution,” it said.  
 Investigations began in March 2006 following Lufthansa’s
application for leniency and found that the airlines’ anti-
competitive behavior began in 1996, when they agreed on the
timing and amount of fuel surcharges on cargo. Lufthansa,
Cargolux, Air France, and KLM face allegations of fixing cargo
rates after investigators found they colluded to set prices on
particular routes, the commission said.
