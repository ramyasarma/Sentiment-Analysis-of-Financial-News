             Five hundred Russian anti-
government activists attacked the office of a Moscow suburb’s
mayor to protest the construction of a highway through a forest,
 Kommersant  reported.  
 The protesters gathered in central Moscow yesterday and
took a commuter train to the northern suburb of Khimki, armed
with air guns and baseball bats, the newspaper reported. Police
fled after being pelted with rocks and bottles and nobody was
arrested, Kommersant said.  
 The anarchist youths set off flares and tried to chop down
the main door of the mayor’s office with an ax, according to
Kommersant. They spray-painted  “Save the Russian Forest”  on
the walls of the building in the five-minute flash protest, the
newspaper reported.  
 An environmentalist camp in the Khimki forest was attacked
by a group of masked men over the weekend, Kommersant said.
Mikhail Beketov, the editor of a local newspaper, was almost
beaten to death in 2008 after campaigning to stop construction
of a highway through the Khimki forest.
