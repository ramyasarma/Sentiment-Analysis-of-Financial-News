             Italy’s Chamber of Deputies voted to
give final approval to a two-year budget adjustment aimed at
cutting the deficit by 25 billion euros ($32.7 billion).  
 The spending package aims to lower the shortfall below the
European Union’s ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product
by the end of 2012.  
 Regional governments must reduce spending by 4.5 billion
euros next year and 4 billion euros in 2012. About 5 billion
euros will come from a three-year freeze on public salaries and
limiting hiring in the next two years. Other steps include
salary cuts for the highest-paid members of the public
administration and fighting tax evasion.  
 Standard & Poor’s today said the budget cuts support the
country’s A+ rating on long-term debt, according to a statement.  
 “If consolidation efforts are delayed or hampered by
fiscal slippage, the long- and short-term sovereign ratings
could come under downward pressure,” S&P said.
