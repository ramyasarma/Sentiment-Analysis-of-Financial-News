             Canadian stocks  rose for the first
time in three days as Suncor Energy Inc. and Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan reported earnings that beat analyst estimates and
insurers rallied.  
 Suncor, Canada’s largest  oil and gas  producer, gained 2.6
percent after topping analyst forecasts by 42 percent, the most
in records dating back to 2005. Manulife Financial Corp., North
America’s third-biggest insurer, jumped 4.3 percent on
speculation new regulations won’t affect the company as much as
previously thought. Cenovus Energy Inc., Canada’s sixth-largest
energy company by market value, sank 4.8 percent after missing
the average analyst estimate of profit by 53 percent.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 32.01
points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,728.64.  
 “Both in Canada and in the U.S., we’ve seen some pretty
decent earnings,” said  Sadiq Adatia , who helps manage C$12
billion ($11.6 billion) as chief investment officer at Russell
Investment Canada in Toronto. “It really is hinting the economy
is starting to get back on track. We’re starting to see some
top-line revenue growth. We are starting to see money put back
into R&D. That’s going to help spur further revenues going
forward.”  
 The S&P/TSX has fallen 0.1 percent this year as economic
data indicating a slow recovery has overshadowed stronger-than-
estimated corporate earnings. Of 23 companies in the  S&P/TSX 60 
index that have reported quarterly earnings since July 12, 14
have topped the average analyst forecast.  
 Suncor Gains  
 Suncor gained 2.6 percent to C$33.91 after operating
earnings quadrupled from a year earlier to C$781 million ($756
million), reflecting the August 2009 purchase of Petro-Canada
and higher fuel prices.  
 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. advanced after reporting
second-quarter earnings that beat the average of 26 analyst
estimates by 14 percent, excluding certain items. The world’s
largest fertilizer producer also increased its 2010 profit
 forecast  to a range of $5 a share to $5.50 a share from the
$4.50 a share to $5.25 a share range announced in April.  
 Fertilizer companies climbed further after Potash Corp.
Chief Executive Officer  Bill Doyle  said in a conference call
Chinese potash demand will rise 29 percent next year. Potash
Corp. rallied 4.6 percent to C$106.39, while Agrium Inc.,
Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer, increased 3.2
percent to C$64.62.  
 Trucking company TransForce Inc. surged 7.7 percent, the
most in 13 months, to C$10.05. The company’s second-quarter
earnings surpassed the average of four analyst estimates by 41
percent.  
 Earnings Miss  
 Cenovus said earnings excluding certain items were 19 cents
a share, missing the 40 cent average of analyst estimates.
Second-quarter operating earnings shrank 72 percent from 2009
due in part to lower natural gas prices, declines in gas
production, increased royalty payments and refinery maintenance,
the company said in a press release. The stock fell 4.8 percent
to C$28.54.  
 The S&P/TSX Insurance  Index  climbed to a one-month high
after Canada’s Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions said new capital requirements for variable
annuities will only affect new business, not existing business.  
 The announcement “is most obviously positive for Manulife
