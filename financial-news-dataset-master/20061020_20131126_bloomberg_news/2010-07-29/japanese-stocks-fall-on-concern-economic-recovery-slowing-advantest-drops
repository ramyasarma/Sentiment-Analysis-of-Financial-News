             Japanese  stocks  fell, sending the
Topix index to its first drop in five days, dragged down by
Panasonic Corp. on concern it will raise capital for
acquisitions and as commodity prices declined.  
 Panasonic tumbled 7.7 percent after the Nikkei newspaper
said the electronics maker may buy the shares it doesn’t already
own of Sanyo Electric Co. and Panasonic Electric Works Co.  NEC
Corp.  retreated 3.7 percent as Japan’s largest maker of personal
computers reported its first-quarter net loss widened. Inpex
Corp., Japan’s largest energy exploration company, sank 3
percent as oil prices declined. Nippon Yusen K.K., the country’s
biggest shipping line by sales, surged 5 percent after raising
its full-year profit forecast.  
 “Market participants can’t decide whether the global
economy will fall into a double-dip recession or will continue
to grow,” said  Ayako Sera , a strategist in Tokyo at Sumitomo
Trust & Banking Co., which manages the equivalent of $310
billion. “As the economic trend can’t be seen clearly, the
market is easily influenced” by news and reports.  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.6 percent to 9,696.02
at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo, after sliding as much as
1.1 percent earlier. The broader  Topix  index dropped 0.5 percent
to 861.27, with almost four times as many stocks declining as
rising.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.3
percent to 1,105.40. In New York, the index lost 0.7 percent to
1,106.13 yesterday.  
 Panasonic Plunges  
 The Topix has declined 5.1 percent in 2010, compared with a
0.8 percent drop by the  S&P 500  and a 1.3 percent gain by the
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are
valued at 18 times estimated  earnings , compared with 13.4 times
for the S&P and 11.9 times for the Stoxx.  
 Panasonic plummeted 7.7 percent to 1,077 yen, the most in
the Nikkei 225. The electronics maker may buy the remaining
shares it doesn’t own of Sanyo Electric and  Panasonic Electric
Works  this year at a combined cost of about 900 billion yen
($10.3 billion), Nikkei English News reported, without saying
how it obtained the information. Panasonic wants to unify
management and focus on such areas as rechargeable batteries and
household goods, Nikkei reported.  
 Panasonic may raise up to 500 billion yen, Reuters reported,
citing two people familiar with the matter. The filing for the
sale may be made today, the report said.  
 Share Sale Concern  
 Sanyo soared 26 percent to 149 yen while Panasonic Electric
Works surged by the daily limit of 150 yen, or 15 percent, to
1,124 yen, the most since at least September 1974. Both advanced
the most in the  Nikkei .  
 “The news is negative in the short term because of
concerns about a capital increase,”  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees the equivalent of $450 million in assets in Tokyo at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “But in the long term, the
strategy is positive for the company because it should help it
use its management resources more efficiently and boost
shareholder value.”  
 NEC  retreated 3.7 percent to 235 yen, the fourth-largest
decline in the Nikkei. The computer maker said its net loss
widened to 43.1 billion yen in the first quarter from 33.8
billion yen a year earlier after sales from its technology-
services and phone-network businesses declined.  
 Earnings Reports  
 Nomura Research Institute Ltd.  plunged 12 percent to 1,723
yen, the biggest decline since October 2008. The drop was the
largest among the 1,669 companies in the Topix index. The
information-technology provider said first-quarter net income
fell 33 percent to 4.08 billion yen due to increased personnel
costs.  
 This week is the peak for April-June  earnings reports  in
Japan, with more than half the companies in the Nikkei 225
releasing results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Mining companies and commodity traders declined after crude
oil for September delivery dropped 0.7 percent yesterday to
$76.99 a barrel in New York.  
 Inpex slumped 3 percent to 423,000 yen. Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co., the nation’s second-biggest oil driller, fell 2
percent to 3,455 yen. Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s largest
commodities trader, sank 1.2 percent to 1,894 yen. Mitsui & Co.,
the second-largest, fell 1.7 percent to 1,136 yen.  
 Shipping lines advanced after Japan’s top three shipping
lines all raised their full-year profit forecasts on a rebound
in global shipping demand. Nippon Yusen, which almost doubled
its outlook to 68 billion yen, surged 5 percent to 358 yen.
 Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. , the No. 3, jumped 2.7 percent to 378
yen, after it projected a full-year profit of 32 billion yen, 78
percent higher than its earlier outlook. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
Ltd., the second-largest shipping line by sales, climbed as much
as 3 percent and closed at 0.5 percent lower than yesterday’s
close, after it increased full-year profit forecast by 8.3
percent to 65 billion yen.  
 “Investors thought shipping companies’ structural
recession would continue, but their container businesses are
improving faster than expected,” said  Takashi Ushio , head of
investment at Marusan Securities Co. in Tokyo.

                          July 28 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg's Courtney Donohoe reports on the performance of the U.S. equity market today.
     U.S. stocks fell, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lower for a second day, after orders or durable goods unexpectedly decreased and the Federal Reserve said economic growth slowed in some areas. Bloomberg's Pimm Fox also speaks. (Source: Bloomberg)
