             Bill Barrett Corp.  won approval from
the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for exploration of natural
gas in the West Tavaputs Plateau in Utah, the company said
today.  
 Barrett rose as much as 7.9 percent in New York trading,
the most since August 2009. The gas field holds the equivalent
of about 324 billion cubic feet of proved and 1.3 trillion cubic
feet equivalent of proved, probable and possible natural gas
reserves in Utah, the Denver-based company said in a statement.  
 The U.S. decision begins a 30-day period during which
appeals can be filed, and the timing of drilling permits depends
on the nature of any appeals, the company said.  
 “This is an important asset in our portfolio,”
Chief Executive Officer  Fred Barrett  said in the statement.  
 The company agreed not to build new well pads in the Jack
and Desolation Canyon Wilderness Study Area and will minimize
development in areas with wilderness characteristics, the Bureau
of Land Management said in a posting in the Federal Register.  
 Bill Barrett rose  $1.86, or 5.8 percent, to $33.97 at 2:27
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after
touching $34.63.
