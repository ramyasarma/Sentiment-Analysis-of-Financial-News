             U.K. government bonds rose as a
report showing  house prices  fell this month added to evidence
that the economic recovery may stall and prevent the central
bank from raising interest rates.  
 The gains pushed the 10-year yield down by the most in more
than two months and pared July’s increase to 3 basis points. The
 average cost  of a home decreased 0.5 percent from a month
earlier, Nationwide Building Society said today. There may be a
“considerable” way for the central bank to go before rates
return to “normal,” Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  said
yesterday. U.K. banks approved fewer mortgages than economists
forecast in June, central bank data showed today.  
 “If it’s not time to put the foot on the brakes, then it’s
hard to be bearish gilts,” said  Kenneth Broux , a senior market
economist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London. “In my mind,
rates are not going anywhere before year-end.”  
 The 10-year yield decreased nine basis points to 3.4
percent as of 5:08 p.m. in London. That was the biggest drop in
the yield since May 19 based on closing prices. The yield
climbed to 3.53 percent on July 27, the most since June 21. The
4.75 percent security maturing March 2020 gained 0.9, or 9
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,559) face amount, to 110.89. The two-
year yield fell nine basis points 0.82 percent.  
 The pound was little changed at $1.5602 and slipped 0.7
percent to 83.86 pence.  
 Gilts returned 4.5 percent this year, compared with a gain
of 5.9 percent for German bonds, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Treasuries handed investors 6.1 percent.  
 Gilts Outperform  
 U.K. lenders granted 47,643 loans to buy homes, compared
with 49,461 in May, the Bank of England said today in London.
That’s the lowest in four months and below the 48,800 median
prediction of 18 economists in Bloomberg News survey.  
 Gilts outperformed their German peers as a report showed
 European confidence  in the economic outlook rose to the highest
in more than two years in July. An  index  of executive and
consumer  sentiment  in the 16 euro nations rose to 101.3 from 99
in June, the  European Commission  in Brussels said today.  
 The extra yield, or  spread , investors demand to hold 10-
year gilts instead of similar maturity bunds narrowed three
basis points to 71 basis points. Gilts also rose relative to 10-
year Treasuries, pushing the spread down by five basis points to
45 basis points.  
 Investors are favoring gilts on bets that a flagging
recovery will help keep inflation within the government’s
3 percent upper limit. The U.K. economy will probably expand
by 1.2 percent this year, trailing behind 3.1 percent in the
U.S. and 2 percent in Germany, according to Bloomberg surveys
of economists.  
 The central bank has cut its benchmark rate to a record low
of 0.5 percent and bought 200 billion pounds of government bonds
to further depress borrowing costs.  
 The 10-year breakeven rate, which measures the yield
difference between regular and index-linked bonds and
anticipates consumer-price growth in the U.K. during the next
decade, was at 267 basis points today, down from a 2010 high of
325 basis points in April.
