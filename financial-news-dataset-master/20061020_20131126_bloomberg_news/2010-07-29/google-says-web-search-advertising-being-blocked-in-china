             Google Inc.  said access to its
website in China is working normally after earlier reporting
that some services, including search, mobile and advertising,
were fully blocked.  
 “Because of the way we measure accessibility in China, it’s
possible that our machines could overestimate the level of
blockage,” the company said today in an e-mailed statement.
“That seems to be what happened last night when there was a
relatively small blockage. It appears now that users in China
are accessing our properties normally.”  
 Google’s initial report on its  website  raised concern that
authorities in China might still be unsatisfied with how the
company complies with local law. Google had also said at least
two other services, including news and images, were partially
blocked, while the Gmail e-mail service was fully or mostly
accessible.  
 Google had its Internet license renewed earlier this month
after it stopped automatically sending Chinese users to its
separate  Hong Kong  site. A conflict with China erupted in
January after the company said it would no longer self-censor
search results in the world’s largest Internet market.  
 Zhang Feng, head of China’s Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology’s communication development department,
said last week the Google China website meets the nation’s
regulations against online content deemed to be illicit.  
 Google fell as much as 2.3 percent to $473.75 in  after-
hours trading . The stock, down 22 percent this year, had gained
64 cents to $484.99 during regular trading on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.
