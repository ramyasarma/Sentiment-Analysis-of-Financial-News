             Canada’s dollar advanced against its
U.S. counterpart for the first time in three days on gains in
oil, the nation’s largest export, and other commodities.  
 Canadian government bonds rose, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note down for a second day. Crude oil futures
rose for the first time in a week, and copper touched a 12-week
high. The nation derives about half its export revenue from raw
materials.  
 “With the bond markets rallying, that’s usually consistent
with a weakening Canadian dollar,” said  Eric Lascelles , chief
economics and rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank in
Toronto. “The twist is that commodities are up.”  
 Canada’s dollar pared gains to C$1.0362 per U.S. dollar at
4:31 p.m. in Toronto, after earlier touching C$1.0303. It closed
at C$1.0388 yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 96.50 U.S.
cents.  
 September futures on crude oil gained 1.6 percent to $78.21
a barrel in New York. Copper futures rose to $3.29 a pound.
Earlier, the price reached $3.297, the highest level for a most-
active contract since May 4. Natural gas futures climbed for a
fourth day to $4.83 per million British thermal units.  
 The Standard & Poors 500 Index fluctuated, dropping 0.4
percent after earlier rising 0.9 percent. Canada’s dollar tends
to track movements in stocks and commodity prices.  
 Canada will auction C$3.2 billion ($3.1 billion) of 3-year
bonds on Aug. 4, according to a statement on the Bank of
Canada’s website. The 2.5 percent securities mature in September
2013.  
 Rival Currencies  
 The Canadian dollar, known as the loonie for the aquatic
bird on the one-dollar coin, is poised for a 2.6 percent gain
against the greenback in July and has risen 1.6 percent this
year, according to Bloomberg data.  
 The loonie lagged behind 10 of its 16 most-traded
currencies this month. The Canadian currency fell 4.04 versus
the euro since June 30. It has depreciated 1.71 against the
pound.  
 “The U.S. dollar is weakening, and Canada doesn’t seem to
be capitalizing all that effectively on that,” Toronton-based
Lascelles said. “It’s not keeping pace with the European
currencies or yen.”  
 Westpac Banking Corp. ended a bet that the Canadian dollar
would rally to its strongest level this month against the Swiss
franc after the loonie failed to rise above 1.05 francs amid
weaker-than-expected economic data.  
 The Canadian dollar declined for a second day against its
Swiss counterpart to 1.0051 francs.  
 “The fatal shot was a result of weak Canadian data,”
 Richard Franulovich , a senior strategist at Westpac in New York,
wrote in a client note.  
 Factory Prices  
 Canadian 10-year government bonds yields fell 3.18 percent,
the lowest yield in a week, from 3.23 percent yesterday.  
 A government report showed factory product prices dropped
in June the most in more than a year, faster than a decline in
raw-material costs.  
 The industrial product price index fell 0.9 percent in June
from May, the most since May 2009, Ottawa-based Statistics
Canada said. Primary metal prices fell 2.9 percent and petroleum
and coal prices fell 2.3 percent. The figures suggest that
factory profit margins narrowed in June.  
 For the 12 months ending in June, industrial prices rose
0.2 percent, the second such increase after more than a year of
declines, the report said. The raw materials index fell 0.1
percent during that time, the first drop after seven prior
gains.
