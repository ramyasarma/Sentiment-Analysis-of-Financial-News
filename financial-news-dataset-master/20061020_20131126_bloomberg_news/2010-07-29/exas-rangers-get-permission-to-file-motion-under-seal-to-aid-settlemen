             The Texas Rangers, the bankrupt
Major League Baseball club, won court permission to file a
motion under seal that the team said will help settle some
disputes in its Chapter 11 case.  
 The motion asks the court to overturn or reconsider some
decisions in the case, the Rangers said today in a filing in
U.S. Bankruptcy court in Fort Worth, Texas. The contents can’t
be made public because the settlement contains “confidential and
highly-sensitive terms” that would be prejudicial to the team if
the motion is denied, the Rangers said.  
 “The settlement, which provides substantial value to the
debtor’s estate, can only be effectuated if the court grants the
motion,” the team said in the filing. The filing didn’t specify
what the settlement concerns.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  D. Michael Lynn  granted the request.  
 The Rangers are scheduled to go up for auction next week. A
group led by attorney  Chuck Greenberg  and Hall of Fame pitcher
 Nolan Ryan  has an agreement to buy the team subject to higher
bids. Lenders led by JPMorgan Chase & Co. oppose the Greenberg-
Ryan deal and the auction process, which they say will chill
bidding and doesn’t give interested buyers enough time to put
together their best offers.  
 The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners, 10-
43400, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort
Worth).
