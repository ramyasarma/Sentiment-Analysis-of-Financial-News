             The following companies’ shares may
be active in Zurich. Stock symbols are in parentheses after
company names. Prices are from the last close.  
 The  Swiss Market Index  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies rose less than 0.1 percent to 6,277.49. The
broader  Swiss Performance Index  gained 0.1 percent to 5,549.03.  
 Bank Sarasin & Cie.  (BSAN SW): The Swiss wealth manager
controlled by Rabobank Groep NV said first-half net income rose
less than 1 percent to 51.2 million Swiss francs ($48.5 million)
as lower trading income countered an inflow of client assets.
That missed the 70.3 million-franc median estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The shares gained 0.6 percent to
42.5 francs.  
 Clariant AG  (CLN VX): The world’s biggest maker of
printing-ink chemicals raised its target for improving margins
after job cuts and a shift in production to Asia helped the
company return to a second-quarter profit. The company posted
net income of 25 million Swiss francs compared with a loss of 61
million francs. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey predicted 22
million francs. The shares slid 0.3 percent to 14.4 francs.  
 EFG International AG  (EFGN SW): Nomura Holdings Inc.
lowered its recommendation for the Swiss bank to “reduce” from
“neutral.” Mediobanca also downgraded the shares to
“neutral” from “outperform.” The shares sank 20 percent to
12.55 francs.  
 Logitech International SA  (LOGN VX): The world’s biggest
maker of computer mice reported first-quarter profit of $19.5
million after a loss of $37.4 million a year earlier, as global
spending on electronics increased. The average estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a $5.73 million profit.
Sales rose 47 percent to $479.3 million, exceeding the company’s
forecast. Analysts estimated revenue of $456.6 million. The
shares rose 1.9 percent to 16.4 francs.  
 Synthes Inc.  (SYST VX): The world’s largest maker of bone-
related medical devices said first-half profit rose 11 percent
$424.6 million on cost controls and sales growth in Europe.
Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined by 1.1
percentage points. The shares slid 0.7 percent to 119.8 francs.
