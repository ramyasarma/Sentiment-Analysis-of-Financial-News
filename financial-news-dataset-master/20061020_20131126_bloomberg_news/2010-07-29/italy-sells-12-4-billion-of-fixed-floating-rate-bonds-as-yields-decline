             Italy sold almost 9.5 billion euros
($12.4 billion) of bonds today, the maximum set for the monthly
sale.  
 Italy priced 3.5 billion euros of three-year bonds to yield
2.01 percent down from 2.33 percent at the previous sale on June
28. Investors bid 1.39 times the amount of the bonds offered,
matching the bid-to-cover ratio in June.  
 The treasury also sold 3.5 billion euros of 10-year bonds
to yield 3.92% percent, compared with a 4.09 percent rate at the
previous sale a month ago. The bid-to-cover ratio was 1.33
times, compared with 1.29 in June.  
 The treasury also sold 2.5 billion euros of floating-rate
notes due in 2015 that were priced with an average yield of 1.7
percent and had a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.44 times the offer.  
 Italy’s $2.1 trillion economy has the euro region’s largest
public debt at 115.8 percent of gross domestic product and must
finance more than 150 billion euros in maturing bonds this year.
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s government has passed
spending cuts worth 24.9 billion euros aimed at cutting the
deficit to 2.7 percent of gross domestic product in 2012.
