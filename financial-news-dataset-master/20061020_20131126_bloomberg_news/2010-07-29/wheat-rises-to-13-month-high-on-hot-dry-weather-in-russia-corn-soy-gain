             Wheat rose to a 13-month high, while
corn and soybeans extended gains, as hot, dry weather damaged
crops from Russia to France, boosting demand for supplies from
the U.S.  
 Temperatures will top 100 degrees (38 Celsius) during the
next 10 days in Russia and Kazakhstan, reducing crop potential,
according to  QT Weather  in Chicago. Global wheat and feed-grain
production will fall 1.6 percent to 1,753 million metric tons, a
three-year low, the  International Grains Council  said. World
reserves before next year’s Northern Hemisphere harvest may drop
5.4 percent.  
 “Weather rallies are fast and furious, and the adverse
weather has generated new speculative-buying interest,” said
 Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler,
Indiana. “We’re not going to run out of wheat anytime soon,
despite some problems in global production, and that could
trigger some selling.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 12 cents, or 1.9
percent, to close at $6.275 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The price earlier touched $6.32, the highest
level for the most-active futures since June 11, 2009. The
commodity has gained 31 percent this month, heading for the
largest monthly gain since August 1973.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 3 cents, or 0.8
percent, to close at $3.9375 a bushel on the CBOT, after
touching $3.995, the highest level since July 22. The commodity
has gained 14 percent since June 29, the day before the
government said U.S. farmers planted less this year than they
had planned.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 10 cents, or
1 percent, to $9.88 a bushel in Chicago. The oilseed, used to
make animal feed and cooking oil, has risen 9.5 percent this
month, heading for the first monthly gain since April.  
 Food Prices  
 Global food prices rose 1.9 percent in July from the
previous month, according to a report today from the United
Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. Food prices are up
12.2 percent from a year earlier.  
 The world’s farmers will harvest 651 million tons of wheat
in the 2010-2011 crop year, 13 million tons less than forecast
last month, the council said. Consumption will amount to 655
million tons, according to the report.  
 Russia will harvest 50 million tons of wheat in 2010, 7
million less than forecast in June, while Kazakhstan’s crop will
be 13.5 million tons, down from 16.5 million tons forecast
earlier, according to the council. France, the European Union’s
largest wheat producer, will harvest 5.2 percent less this year,
farm adviser Offre et Demande Agricole said today.  
 U.S. Exports  
 The U.S. will export 26 million tons in the marketing year
that began June 1, more than a previous forecast of 24.1 million
tons, the Grains Council said. A year earlier, exports totaled
23 million tons.  
 In the week ended July 22, U.S. exporters sold 919,894 tons
of wheat for delivery before June 1, more than double a week
earlier and up from 575,070 a year earlier, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said today.  
 Sales  of soybeans for delivery during the final month of
the current marketing year and the one that begins Sept. 1 rose
to 1.483 million tons, up from 1.227 million a week earlier, the
USDA said.  
 Corn sales for delivery before the end of August, fell to
432,322 tons, compared with 614,121 a week earlier, the USDA
said. In a separate report today, the department said Mexico
bought 146,000 tons.  
 “Today’s confirmation from a respected source that former
Soviet Union supplies are being hurt significantly provides more
confidence to bulls and puts more pressure on importers to cover
their needs sooner, not later,”  Jerry Gidel , a market analyst
for North American Risk Management Services Inc., said in an e-
mail.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government figures
show.
