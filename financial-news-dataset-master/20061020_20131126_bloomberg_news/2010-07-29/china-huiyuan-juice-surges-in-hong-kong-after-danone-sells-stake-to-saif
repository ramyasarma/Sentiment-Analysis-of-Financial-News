             China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd. , the
company  Coca-Cola Co.  proposed to buy before being blocked by
Chinese regulators, rose the most in almost two months after
 Groupe Danone SA  agreed to sell its stake to SAIF Partners Ltd.  
 Huiyuan  rose as much as 7.9 percent to HK$5.85, the biggest
intraday gain since June 8, and traded at HK$5.78 at 11:58 a.m.
in Hong Kong. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.2 percent.  
 SAIF Partners, which manages $4 billion, will acquire
Danone’s 22.98 percent stake for HK$6 a share, the French
company said in a statement yesterday. Beijing-based  Huiyuan 
competes for beverage sales against Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc.
and other beverage drink makers that are boosting spending in
China to expand beyond soft drinks.  
 “We expect renewed market talks of M&As for Huiyuan,” UBS
AG Product Manager  Herman Chan  said in a note to clients.
Huiyuan’s stock “is likely to enjoy a boost in the near term.”  
 Danone , the world’s biggest yogurt maker, has vowed to
avoid joint ventures in China after it sold its stake in food
and beverage maker  Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co.  in 2009, ending two
years of lawsuits.  
 Hong Kong-based SAIF Partners, a venture-capital fund
focused on China and India, will spend 200 million euros ($260
million) to acquire the  Huiyuan  stake.  
 Huiyuan  has gained 4.7 percent this year, compared with a
3.4 percent decline for the Hang Seng Index.
