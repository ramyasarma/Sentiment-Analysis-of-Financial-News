             Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS , a Turkish
state-run bank, said second-quarter profit rose 23 percent as it
lent more to consumers and businesses and recovered loans left
unpaid after the financial crisis.  
 Net income climbed to 519.8 million liras ($344 million)
from 422.5 million liras a year earlier, according to a filing
with the Istanbul Stock Exchange today. The mean estimate of 10
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg  was 496.5 million liras.  
 “Halkbank’s growing more aggressively compared to peers
and their loan book is much bigger than last year as they
continued to lend,” said  Funda Afacan , an analyst at BGC
Partners Inc. in Istanbul. “They’re also reporting significant
gains from the recovery of non-performing loans.”  
 Banks in Turkey, which didn’t have a government bailout
after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed in September 2008,
are lending more as the central bank keeps the benchmark
interest rate at a record low of 7 percent. The economy expanded
11.7 percent in the first quarter, lagging only China among the
Group of 20 industrialized nations.  
 Net interest income rose 7 percent in the second quarter to
823.7 million liras, Halkbank said. Lending grew to 38.3 billion
liras from 32.5 billion liras at the end of last year.  
 Halkbank has been expanding its loans at a faster pace than
most rivals as it switches out of illiquid government bonds. The
bank sees 20 percent growth in loans this year, Chief Executive
Officer  Huseyin Aydin  said May 13.  
 The government raised $1.9 billion selling 25 percent of
Halkbank to the public in May 2007. The state  asset sales agency 
in Ankara has said it may sell more shares in the lender,
without setting a date.
