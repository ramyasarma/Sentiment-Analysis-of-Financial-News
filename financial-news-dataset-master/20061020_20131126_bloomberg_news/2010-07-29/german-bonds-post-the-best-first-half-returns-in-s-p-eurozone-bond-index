             German government bonds were the
best performers among euro-region counterparts in the first
half, according to Standard & Poor’s.  
 German government debt returned 6.99 percent, more than
double the S&P Eurozone Government Bond Index’s total return of
2.67 percent, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
Greek securities lost almost 19 percent, while Spanish bonds
fell 2.4 percent.  
 “The first six months of 2010 have seen quite dramatically
diverging performance by the sovereign constituents of our
Eurozone Government Bond Index,”  J.R. Rieger , vice president of
fixed income at S&P Indices, wrote in the report.  
 As a result of differences in performance and supply, the
composition of the index has shifted, the report showed. France,
Germany, the Belgium, the Netherlands, Luexmbourg and Finland
represented 59.8 percent of the gauge, up from 58.3 percent at
the start of the year. The combined weight of Portuguese, Greek,
Spanish and Irish debt has fallen to 17.9 percent from 18.9
percent over the same period.
