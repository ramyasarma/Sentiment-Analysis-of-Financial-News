             Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. , the
operator of the world’s largest merchant fleet, raised its full-
year profit forecast as demand for transporting goods between
Asia and the U.S. and Europe rebounded.  
 Mitsui expects  net income  of 65 billion yen ($745 million)
for the year ending March 31, compared with its earlier forecast
of 60 billion yen, the Tokyo-based shipping line said in a
statement today. The company kept its forecast for sales at 1.55
trillion yen.  
 Japanese shipping lines are benefiting from higher rates
for transporting goods and the introduction of peak-season
surcharges as the global economic rebound helped boost demand.
Steel and iron-ore price gains may also help improve Chinese
demand for bulk shipping, analysts said.  
 “The rebound in container rates is helping shipping
lines,” said  Ryota Himeno , an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities Co. “We’ll probably see prices for bulk
shipping also increase later this year.”  
 Mitsui had profit of 20.8 billion yen in the three months
ended June 30, compared with a loss of 13 billion yen a year
earlier. Sales rose by a third in the quarter to 397 billion yen
from 297 billion yen.  
 The shipping line said yesterday one of its ships may have
been attacked near the Strait of Hormuz, which is a transit
point for tankers carrying oil from producers including Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar.  
 Adding Surcharges  
 Mitsui O.S.K. rose 0.5 percent to 608 yen at the 11 a.m.
close of morning trading in Tokyo.  
 Nippon Yusen K.K.  last month said it was planning to add an
extra $200 per 20-foot container on routes between Asia and
North America after demand increased.  
 Shipments to the U.S. from Asia rose for a fifth month in
April, gaining 13.1 percent, according to figures from the  Japan
Maritime Center .  
 Chinese steel prices rose 4.7 percent last week, the most
in 11 months. Derivatives for fourth-quarter iron-ore prices
jumped 23 percent between July 9 and 21, Deutsche Bank AG said.
Costs for leasing capesize ships used to carry iron ore will
average $30,375 a day in the fourth quarter, from $12,643 now,
according to the median in a Bloomberg survey of 18 analysts.  
 The  Baltic index , a measure of commodity-shipping rates,
rose for the ninth day yesterday, gaining 1.7 percent to 1,901
in London, following its longest slump in almost 15 years.
