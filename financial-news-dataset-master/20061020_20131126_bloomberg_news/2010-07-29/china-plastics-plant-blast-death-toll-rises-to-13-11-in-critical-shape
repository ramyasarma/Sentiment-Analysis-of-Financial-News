             An explosion at a plastics
factory yesterday in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing
killed 13 people and hospitalized 120.  
 Fourteen people were severely injured and 11 remain in
critical condition, Huang Yilong, deputy head of the local
healthcare bureau, said at a press conference today at a
local labor office near the blast site.  
 The explosion was caused when a digging machine ruptured
a propylene pipe, the official said.  
 Huang denied rumors of a shortage of blood supplies for
victims of the blast.
