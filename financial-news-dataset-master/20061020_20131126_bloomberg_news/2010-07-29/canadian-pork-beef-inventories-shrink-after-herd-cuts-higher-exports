             Canadian pork inventories on July 1
were 13 percent smaller than a year earlier, as herd cuts
spurred a drop in meat production and exports rebounded. Beef
supplies also shrank.  
 Warehouses  held 40,524 metric tons (89.34 million pounds)
of pork, down from 46,742 tons in July 2009, Statistics Canada
said today in a report. Beef stockpiles shrank 9.8 percent from
a year earlier to 17,467 tons, the government agency said.  
 Farmers, hurt by losses that began in 2005 and lasted until
April, reduced their  hog-breeding herds  by about 19 percent over
five years, said  Victor Aideyan , a senior risk-management
consultant at HISGRAIIN Commodities Inc. in London, Ontario.
Canadian pork exports in the first five months of 2010 rose 4.9
percent from a year earlier, government data show.  
 “The demand side looks very good right now across the
board,” Aideyan said. “Domestic demand in Canada and the U.S.
is relatively stable. The export market has really been the
bright spot.”  
 As of July 17, pork  production  in Canada had declined 0.5
percent this year from the same period in 2009, according to
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada data.  
 The Canadian  cattle herd  as of Jan. 1 totaled 13.015
million head, the fewest since at least 2004. The government is
scheduled to update livestock-inventory data next month.  
 Canadian  chicken  inventories totaled 35,543 tons on July 1,
down 6.4 percent from a year earlier, Statistics Canada said
today. Turkey stockpiles shrank 3.8 percent to 35,811 tons.
