             Wheat futures in Chicago rallied for
a fourth day after rising to a 13-month high yesterday as hot,
dry weather damaged crops from Russia to France.  
 The September-delivery contract gained 0.6 percent to $6.31
a bushel at 7:20 a.m. Singapore time. Soybean futures rose 0.1
percent to $9.8925 a bushel and corn was unchanged at $3.9375.
