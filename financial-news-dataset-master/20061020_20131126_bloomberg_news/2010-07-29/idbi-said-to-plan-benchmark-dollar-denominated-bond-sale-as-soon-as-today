             IDBI Bank Ltd. , the Indian state-
owned lender, plans to sell 5 1/2-year bonds denominated in U.S.
dollars as soon as today, according to two people with knowledge
of the matter.  
 The bank is marketing the notes to yield 310 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, one of the people said,
asking not to be identified because the details are private.  
 IDBI hired Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings Plc,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Standard Chartered Plc to
arrange a sale of about $500 million in bonds, Executive
Director Melwyn Rego said this month. Calls to IDBI Chief
Financial Officer  P. Sitaram  today weren’t answered.  
 The sale would be the Mumbai-based lender’s first since it
set up a $1.5 billion medium-term bond program in November 2007.
IDBI, previously known as Industrial Development Bank of India
Ltd., last sold dollar-denominated bonds in December 2004,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The $250 million of five-year, 5.125 percent notes were
priced to yield 162.8 basis points more than Treasuries, the
data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Moody’s Investors Service ranks the IDBI debt at Baa3, its
lowest investment-grade rating, the person said. Standard &
Poor’s grades the debt an equivalent BBB-.
