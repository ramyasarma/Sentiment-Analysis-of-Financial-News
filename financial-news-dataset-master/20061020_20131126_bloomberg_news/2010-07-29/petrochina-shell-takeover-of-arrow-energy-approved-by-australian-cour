             PetroChina Co.  and  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc  won Australian court approval for the A$3.5 billion ($3.2
billion) takeover of  Arrow Energy Ltd.   
 Federal Court of Australia Judge Margaret Stone approved
the transaction, which is scheduled to close Aug. 23, following
a hearing in Sydney today.  
 Shell, BG Group Plc, Santos Ltd. and ConocoPhillips are
among companies planning more than $40 billion of investment in
Queensland projects that will convert gas extracted from coal
seams into liquefied natural gas.  
 “Today’s court decision paves the way for Arrow to grow
and create more jobs and economic wealth for Queensland and for
Australia,”  Russell Caplan , Shell’s Australian chairman, said
in a statement.  
 Arrow, whose shares were unchanged at A$4.68 at the 4:10
p.m. close of trading on the Australian Stock Exchange, will be
delisted from the exchange within a day or two of the closing of
the transaction, Shell’s lawyer Gavin Ryan said in an interview.  
 The takeover was approved by 95 percent of Arrow’s
shareholders at a July 14 meeting, the company’s lawyer, Tom
Bathurst, told the judge at today’s hearing.
