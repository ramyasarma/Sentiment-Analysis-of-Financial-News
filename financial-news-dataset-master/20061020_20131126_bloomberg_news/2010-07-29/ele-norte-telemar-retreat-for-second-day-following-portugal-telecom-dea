             Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA 
slid for a second session, extending its drop to 24 percent,
after saying it will sell 12 billion reais ($6.8 billion) in
stock to existing shareholders as part of  Portugal Telecom SGPS
SA ’s agreement to buy a stake in Telemar Norte Leste SA.  
 Tele Norte, the parent of Telemar, Brazil’s biggest fixed-
line telephone company, plunged 9.4 percent to 31.91 reais in
Sao Paulo trading at 1:20 p.m. New York time. Tele Norte’s
preferred, or non-voting shares, dropped 5.7 percent to 25.63
reais after falling 11 percent yesterday. Telemar preferred
shares lost 5.5 percent, stretching their two-day decline to 14
percent.  
 Tele Norte plans to raise 12 billion reais by selling
common shares for 38.55 reais and preferred, or non-voting,
stock for 28.26 reais to existing shareholders, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday. Telemar will also offer existing
shareholders 12 billion reais in stock, selling common shares
for 63.70 reais and preferred for 50.70 reais each.  
 The companies may raise less than they plan, Itau Unibanco
Holding SA wrote in a note to clients today. Tele Norte will
probably raise 2.5 billion reais at most because Portugal
Telecom and Telemar Participacoes SA, which controls the
company, may be the only investors who buy shares, Itau
strategist  Carlos Constantini  said.  
 Portugal Telecom will pay a maximum 8.4 billion reais for
indirect and direct stakes equivalent to 22 percent of Oi, as
Telemar is known, the companies said yesterday in regulatory
filings. Telemar also plans to acquire 10 percent of Portugal
Telecom, replacing Telefonica SA as the Portuguese company’s
biggest investor.
