             U.K. stocks dropped for a third day,
extending the benchmark FTSE 100 Index’s loss this week, after a
report showed the U.S. economy grew less than forecast in the
second quarter.  
 Royal Dutch  Shell Plc  and  HSBC Holdings Plc  led shares on
the FTSE 100 lower after the U.S. government report showed
growth in the world’s largest economy slowed to a 2.4 percent
annual rate in the second quarter. Shire, the Dublin-based
drugmaker, lost 2.4 percent as Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. cut
its recommendation on the stock.  
 The  FTSE 100  fell 55.93, or 1.1 percent, to 5,258.02 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London, bringing the gauge’s decline this
week to 1 percent and paring its 6.9 percent rally for the
month. The  FTSE All-Share Index  declined 1.1 percent and
Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  retreated 0.3 percent today.  
 “The brief rally seen over the last two weeks has lost its
steam, with disappointing macro data failing to fuel what many
hoped would be a long-term rally,” said Chris Purdy, a trader
at Spreadex Ltd. in London. U.S. gross domestic product figures
“confirmed what many analysts had been suspecting -- growth was
softening as tax credits expired and financial systems remain in
a tenuous state.”  
 U.S. Economy  
 The 2.4 percent increase to the size of the U.S. economy in
the second quarter trailed a median forecast of 2.6 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The Commerce Department
upwardly revised economic growth in the first quarter to 3.7
percent, showing a jump in inventories. Business investment
climbed at the fastest rate since 1997. Corporate spending on
equipment and software jumped at a 22 percent annual rate.  
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke last week said the
central bank is prepared to take further policy actions if the
world’s largest economy “doesn’t continue to improve.”  
 Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, lost 1.6 percent to
1,754.5 pence and HSBC, the region’s biggest bank, declined 1.6
percent to 646 pence.  BP Plc  retreated 1.8 percent to 405.95
pence. The three companies led the FTSE 100 index lower.  
 Shire lost 2.4 percent to 1,455 pence. Bernstein cut its
recommendation on the shares to “market perform” from
“outperform,” according to a report.  
 United Business Media Ltd . declined 3.9 percent to 550.5
pence. The publisher of InformationWeek said first-half net
income dropped to 45.5 million pounds ($71.5 million) from 48
million pounds a year earlier.
