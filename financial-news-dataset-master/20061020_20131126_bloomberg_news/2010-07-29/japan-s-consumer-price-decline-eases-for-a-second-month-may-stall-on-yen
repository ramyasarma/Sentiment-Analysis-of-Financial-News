             Japan’s consumer-price declines
eased for a second month in June, improvements that may stall
as a stronger yen lowers import costs.  
 Prices  excluding fresh food slid 1 percent from a year
earlier, easing from 1.2 percent in May, the statistics bureau
said today in Tokyo. The median estimate of 27 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 1.1 percent drop.  
 Bank of Japan officials say price decreases will continue
to moderate as the economy expands. Even so, the central bank
may face political pressure to ease monetary policy in an
effort to stem the currency’s advance and quell deflation, said
economist  Junko Nishioka .  
 “A strong yen hinders prices from rising,” Nishioka,
chief economist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo, said
before the report. “An appreciating yen may add more pressure
on the BOJ” to implement extra steps, including the expansion
of a 20 trillion yen ($230 billion) fund-supply program.  
 BOJ board member  Hidetoshi Kamezaki  said this week that a
rising yen may hurt exporters’ competitiveness and the central
bank will act “proactively” to combat deflation. The yen has
climbed 8.3 percent against the dollar and 10 percent versus
the euro in the past three months.  
 BOJ policy makers this month revised their core-price
forecast for the year ending March 2011 to a drop of 0.4
percent from an April projection of a 0.5 percent decline. They
kept next fiscal year’s forecast for an increase of 0.1 percent.  
 “The moderation of core prices will continue, but only at
an extremely slow pace,” said  Yoshimasa Maruyama , a senior
economist at Itochu Corp. in Tokyo. “Prices won’t reach
positive territory at least until 2012.”  
 Retailers are discounting to encourage spending among
consumers whose  wages  slid for 21 consecutive months to
February. Japan’s three biggest beef-bowl restaurant chains,
Yoshinoya Holdings Co., Matsuya Foods Co. and  Zensho Co. , this
week slashed prices temporarily. The three companies launched
similar campaigns in April.
