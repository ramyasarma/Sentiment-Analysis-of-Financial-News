             Anglo American Plc , owner of the
world’s biggest platinum producer, may tomorrow announce a delay
of as much as a year and a cost overrun of up to $500 million at
its Minas Rio iron-ore project, Sanford C. Bernstein said.  
 “We remain concerned that even after tomorrow’s revised
schedule is announced, further delays to this project are
possible,” analyst  Paul Galloway  wrote in a note. The Brazilian
project is London-based Anglo’s biggest in terms of cost.  
 Anglo  said in February the first phase of the project could
cost $3.8 billion, 41 percent more than its previous estimate of
$2.7 billion. Production is scheduled to start in the second
half of 2012, ramping up to full output of 26.5 million metric
tons a year in the third quarter of 2013, it said at the time.
Anglo initially said production could start in 2010.  
 Anglo gained full control of Minas Rio after paying $5.5
billion in 2008 to acquire iron ore mines controlled by
Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista . In February this year, Anglo
wrote $1.5 billion off the value of Amapa, an operating iron ore
producer acquired as part of the deal.  
 Anglo may report underlying earnings of $1.96 a share
tomorrow from $0.91 a year earlier, according to the median of
seven analysts’  forecasts  compiled by Bloomberg.
