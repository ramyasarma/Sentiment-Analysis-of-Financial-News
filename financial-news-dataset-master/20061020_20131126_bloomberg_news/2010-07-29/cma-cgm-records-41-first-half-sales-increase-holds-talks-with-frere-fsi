             CMA CGM SA, the French shipper
reorganizing 5.4 billion euros ($7.1 billion) of debt, recorded
a 41 percent surge in first-half sales as the global shipping
recovery lifted prices and volumes.  
 Revenue jumped to $6.8 billion from $4.8 billion, according
to figures obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed by CMA
spokesman Guillaume Foucault. Freight volumes rose 22 percent to
4.41 million containers.  
 “The recovery of demand and freight tariffs is clearly
well underway,” Foucault said by telephone, declining to
comment on the reorganization talks. “It’s a solid
turnaround.”  
 CMA and competitors including Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd AG were
forced to renegotiate debt and seek new capital last year after
the economic crisis hit shipping demand and rates. The $1
billion recorded by CMA in first-half earnings before interest,
taxes and depreciation compares with a $568 million loss in the
same period of 2009.  
 France’s FSI sovereign-wealth fund is in talks with Belgian
billionaire  Albert Frere ’s  Cie. Nationale a Portefeuille SA  over
a joint investment in the shipping company, said an FSI
spokesman who declined to be named, citing company policy.
Nationale a Portefeuille didn’t return calls and messages left
for Managing Director  Gilles Samyn .
