             Northrop Grumman Corp.  boosted its
2010 profit forecast and said second-quarter earnings jumped 80
percent on rising aircraft demand, while  Raytheon Co.  pared its
sales outlook after a U.K. contract was canceled.  
 Northrop’s full-year profit will be $6.60 to $6.80 a share,
up from $5.75 to $6, the third-largest  U.S. defense contractor 
said today. Raytheon, No. 5 in the U.S. industry, said quarterly
profit excluding the lost contract rose even as it cut the top
end of its full-year revenue forecast.  
 The results capped earnings releases this week from the
biggest defense companies, led by  Lockheed Martin Corp. , amid a
squeeze on U.S. weapons spending. Northrop is studying the sale
or spinoff of its shipbuilding unit to focus on its electronics,
aerospace and information-systems businesses.  
 “Northrop continues to build momentum,”  Joel Levington , a
bond analyst at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New
York, said in an e-mail. Raytheon “gets no respect. All it does
it post strong earnings quarter after quarter with very good
operational execution and cash flows, and no one seems to
care,” Levington said.  
 Northrop  gained 5 cents to $58.44 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Waltham, Massachusetts-based
 Raytheon  dropped $1.60, or 3.3 percent, to $46.67, for the
biggest decline since June 29.  
 Northrop Profit  
 Northrop, based in Los Angeles, said net income climbed to
$711 million, or $2.34 a share, from $394 million, or $1.21, a
year earlier. Profit excluding items was $2.36 a share. Analysts
forecast $2.20, the average of 15 estimates Bloomberg compiled.  
 Sales rose 3.3 percent to $8.83 billion.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Wes Bush , who took over in January,
announced the possible sale or spinoff of the shipbuilding unit
this month. Bush has also said improving profit margins is a
higher priority than winning new orders.  
 The consolidation of Northrop’s two Gulf Coast shipyards
into one Mississippi facility and studying an exit from that
business is “yet more evidence of an increasingly shareholder-
value focused company,”  Douglas Harned , an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein in New York, wrote in a July 26 note. He rates the
stock as “outperform.”  
 Contractors have been under pressure as Defense Secretary
 Robert Gates  seeks to limit a “gusher of defense spending.”
Lockheed raised its full-year forecast on July 27 on rising
sales at its space and information-systems units. Raytheon, the
world’s largest missile maker, is trying to diversify by pushing
sales at the unit that provides technical training.  
 Raytheon Results  
 The termination of the U.K. Border Agency contract, begun
in November 2007 and worth about $1.3 billion, led Raytheon to
cut its 2010 sales forecast range.  Sales  will rise to $25.6
billion to $26.1 billion, according to Raytheon, which
previously predicted $25.9 billion to $26.4 billion. The 2009
total was $24.9 billion.  
 Raytheon said  net income  declined to $208 million, or 55
cents a share, from $489 million, or $1.23, a year earlier.
Profit from operations excluding the canceled contract was $1.27
a share. Analysts predicted $1.19, the average of 20  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Profit was lowered by a charge of $274 million, or 71
cents, related to the end of the U.K. order. The Home Office
found that critical parts for the program to collect and analyze
data on travelers to and from the country were running 12 months
late, the British government said July 22.  
 “What we have delivered works and provides actionable
information for the customer,” Chief Financial Officer  Dave Wajsgras  said today in a telephone interview. “We are in
litigation” to recover costs from the U.K. government, he said.  
 Second-quarter sales declined 2.5 percent to $5.97 billion.
