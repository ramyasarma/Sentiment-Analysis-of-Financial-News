             Fauji Fertilizer Co. , Pakistan’s
biggest urea maker, said second-quarter profit rose 27 percent
because of higher sales.  
 Net income rose to 2.37 billion rupees ($27.7 million), or
3.50 rupees a share, in the three months ended June 30, from
1.86 billion rupees, or 2.74 rupees a share, the Karachi-based
company said in a statement to the stock exchange today. Sales
rose to 10.4 billion rupees from 8.66 billion rupees.  
 Farmers are using more fertilizer to boost farm output,
which accounts for a quarter of the South Asian nation’s gross
domestic product, after wheat and sugar shortages in past two
years caused nationwide riots.  
 Fauji , which has risen 9.4 percent this year, increased 0.3
percent to 112.60 rupees at 1:31 p.m. on the Karachi Stock
Exchange. The company plans to pay a cash dividend of 3.50
rupees a share, according to the statement.  
 The company’s profit in the six months ended June 30 rose
to 5.1 billion rupees or 7.52 rupees a share, from 4.55 billion
rupees, or 6.70 rupees a share, according to the statement.
Sales rose to 19.9 billion rupees, from 16.9 billion rupees.
