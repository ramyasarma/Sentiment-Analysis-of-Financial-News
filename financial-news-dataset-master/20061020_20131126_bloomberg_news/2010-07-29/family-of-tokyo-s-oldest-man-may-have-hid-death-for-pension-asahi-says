             Family members of a man who was
thought to be Tokyo’s oldest may have concealed his death for
about 30 years so as to continue receiving pension benefits, the
Asahi newspaper said.   
 Police are investigating whether family members of the man,
who would have turned 111 last week if he was still alive,
committed fraud, the report said.   
 Police found the partially mummified corpse of the man
dressed in underwear and covered with blankets in a bed
yesterday evening at the family’s home in the city’s north, the
newspaper said. The man’s oldest daughter, 81, and
granddaughter, 53, live in the house, the report said.  
 About 9.45 million yen in pension payments was deposited in
the man’s bank account over the last six years, the report said.
This month 2.7 million yen was withdrawn, the newspaper said.
