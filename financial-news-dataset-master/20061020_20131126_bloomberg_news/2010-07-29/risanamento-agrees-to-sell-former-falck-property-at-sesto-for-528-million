             Risanamento SpA , the Italian real-
estate company that last year averted bankruptcy, agreed to sell
a property development near Milan to investors led by Davide
Bizzi for 405 million euros ($530 million).  
 The investors will pay 85 percent of the total by Sept. 30
and the rest when the proposed development plan in Sesto San
Giovanni has been approved, the Milan-based company said in a
statement today.  
 The project, which will have 1.3 million square meters (14
million square feet) of office and residential space, was
designed by  Renzo Piano .  
 In November, Risanamento received court approval for a
restructuring plan. As part of the plan, creditors including
 Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  and  UniCredit SpA  agreed to buy as much as
150 million euros in new shares and underwrite convertible debt.  
 Risanamento rose as much as 8.4 percent in Milan trading.
The shares were up 5.1 percent at 34.3 cents at 11:25 a.m.,
giving the company a market value of 94 million euros.
