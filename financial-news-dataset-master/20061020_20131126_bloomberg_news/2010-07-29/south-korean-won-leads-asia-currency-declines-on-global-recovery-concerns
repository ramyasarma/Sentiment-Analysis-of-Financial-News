             Asian currencies strengthened, led
by India’s rupee and the Philippine peso, on speculation inflows
will climb as regional economies lead a global recovery.  
 The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index rose to a five-
week high and the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  of shares was headed
for its best close in more than two months, after earlier losses.
Singapore’s gross domestic product increased a record 18 percent
in the first half of 2010 and the city-state’s central bank
today forecast “high levels” of economic activity for the rest
of the year. Global funds have pumped about $7 billion into
stock markets in India, South Korea and Taiwan this month alone.  
 “The recovery in stock markets makes people less risk
averse, making it easier to buy emerging-market currencies,”
said  Dariusz Kowalczyk , a Hong Kong-based senior economist and
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “The solid growth in the
region supports Asian currencies.”  
 The rupee appreciated 0.3 percent to 46.623 per dollar as
of 2:31 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The peso gained 0.3 percent to 45.713 and the Singapore dollar
strengthened 0.2 percent to S$1.3633. Indonesia’s rupiah
advanced 0.3 percent to a three-year high of 8,980.  
 Singapore’s growth is supported by a broad range of
industries that will remain “largely intact” in 2010, the
Monetary Authority of Singapore said in its annual report today.
The government predicts GDP will increase 13 percent to 15
percent this year.  
 Expanding Economies  
 Thailand’s economy expanded about 8 percent in the second
quarter, after 12 percent growth in the previous three months,
Satit Rangkasiri, head of the finance ministry’s fiscal policy
office, said today in Bangkok. Philippine growth may be
“higher” in the second quarter than the 7.3 percent pace
reported for the first three months of 2010, Economic Planning
Assistant Director Myrna Asuncion said yesterday.  
 The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-
used currencies excluding the yen, climbed 0.2 percent to 111.77
and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares rose 0.2 percent.  
 South Korea’s won slid 0.2 percent to 1,186.5 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency reached a
five-week high of 1,181.33 on July 27 before retreating
yesterday as traders said the Bank of Korea bought dollars to
counter appreciation.  
 Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar reached a five-week high of
NT$31.85, before closing little changed at NT$32.068 in Taipei.
Malaysia’s ringgit rose 0.2 percent to 3.1883 and Thailand’s
baht was little changed at 32.25.
