             Crude oil rose for the first time in
a week as the dollar weakened against the euro, boosting the
appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.  
 Oil gained 1.8 percent as the dollar fell to a 12-week low
against the euro amid confidence that Europe’s economy improved.
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for
unemployment insurance decreased, signaling that fuel demand may
rise as the job market improves.  
 “The oil market is being set by the financial markets,”
said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in
New York. “We’re back to that kind of correlation trade and not
paying so much attention to niggly details like rising
inventories and rising OPEC production.”  
 Crude oil for September delivery gained $1.37 to settle at
$78.36 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have
risen 24 percent in the past year and 3.6 percent this month.  
 The dollar  fell against the euro after the European
Commission in Brussels reported European confidence in the
economic outlook rose to the highest level in more than two
years in July. The euro increased 0.7 percent to $1.308 at 3:07
p.m. in New York. Earlier, it climbed to $1.3107.  
 U.S. jobless claims fell by 11,000 to 457,000 in the week
ended July 24, the Labor Department reported in Washington.  
 German unemployment also declined for a 13th month in July
as exports sustained a recovery. The number of people out of
work declined a seasonally adjusted 20,000 to 3.21 million, the
lowest level since November 2008, the Federal Labor Agency in
Nuremberg said today.  
 Commodities Advance  
 The dollar’s decline boosted commodities across the board.
The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities advanced 1.5
percent to 270.2, the strongest level since May 4. Eighteen of
the commodities increased.  
 Investment funds appear to be doing “pretty strong
buying” of energy commodities, said  Tom Bentz , a senior energy
analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York.  
 Oil declined to a one-week low yesterday after a government
report showed U.S. crude imports jumped to the highest level in
almost four years, leading to an unexpected increase in overall
 inventories .  
 “The weak dollar is kind of glossing over the fact that
the market is kind of feeling the weight of these gluttonous
supplies,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at
PFGBest in Chicago.  
 U.S. Imports  
 Crude supplies  climbed 7.31 million barrels to 360.8
million in the week ended July 23, the biggest increase since
March 19, according to the Energy Department. Imports rose 1.18
million barrels a day, or 12 percent, to 11.2 million, the
highest level since Aug. 25, 2006.  
 “Fundamentals appear to be becoming increasingly
negative,” said  Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch &
Associates, a Galena, Illinois, consulting firm.  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ oil
output increased for the third time in four months in July, led
by gains in Iraq, the one member not subject to a quota, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 OPEC production rose by 80,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent, to
an average 29.24 million barrels a day from a revised 29.16
million in June, according to the survey of oil companies,
producers and analysts. Output by members with quotas gained
30,000 barrels to 26.825 million from a revised 26.795 million
in June. The July figure was 1.98 million above their target.  
 OPEC Shipments  
 OPEC, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
will reduce shipments in the four weeks to Aug. 14, as summer
demand for driving fuels wanes in the U.S. and Europe, according
to a report today from tanker tracker Oil Movements. OPEC will
ship 23.42 million barrels a day in the period, down from 23.79
million barrels a day in the month to July 17.  
 Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange rose $1.53, or 2 percent, to $77.59
a barrel.  
 Equities erased early gains as declines in technology and
consumer-staples shares wiped out an early advance triggered by
better-than-estimated earnings by companies such as  Exxon Mobil
Corp.  and  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  and the drop in jobless
claims.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.4 percent to
1,101.53 at 4:03 p.m. in New York, and  the Dow Jones Industrial
Average  lost 0.3 percent to 10,467.16.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 505,724
contracts as of 3:09 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 578,140
contracts yesterday, 17 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.25 million contracts, the
highest level in two weeks.
