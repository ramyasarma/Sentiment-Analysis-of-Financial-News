             Shinhan Financial Group Co. , South
Korea’s largest financial company by market value, said second-
quarter profit advanced 34 percent as the nation’s economy
recovered and provisions for bad debts declined.  
 Net income rose to 588.6 billion won ($496 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 439.7 billion won a year earlier,
the Seoul-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
That beat the average of 568.3 billion won from 15 analysts’
 estimates  in last 28 days compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Shinhan is set to benefit in the second half from wider
profit margins on lending after the central bank this month
tightened monetary policy to damp inflation risks. Economic
growth forecast at 5.9 percent this year may reduce bad debts
further at Shinhan, which makes the majority of its loans to
households and small businesses.  
 “The net interest margin should rise in the second half,
helped by the central bank’s rate hike,” said  Han Jeong Tae , an
analyst at Hana Daewoo Securities Co. in Seoul. Shinhan also
makes fewer loans than rivals for construction projects, which
may increase bad debts for some lenders, said Han.  
 The Bank of Korea raised its benchmark interest rate on
July 9 for the first time since the global crisis, joining
counterparts across Asia in unwinding monetary stimulus as the
region leads world growth. The central bank lifted the seven-day
repurchase rate to 2.25 percent from a record 2 percent.  
 Interest Income  
 Shinhan  posted 1.93 trillion won in interest income last
quarter, compared with 1.48 trillion won a year earlier. The
company’s net interest margin, a key measure of profitability
from lending, widened to 3.48 percent from 2.77 percent, Shinhan
said.  
 The company in the second quarter set aside 307 billion won
in loan-loss provisions, compared with 531.4 billion won a year
earlier. Non-performing loans fell to 1.48 percent of total
credit, from 1.49 percent three months earlier.  
 Shares of  Shinhan Financial  gained 0.6 percent to 49,200
won in Seoul trading before earnings were released. The stock
has risen 14 percent this year.  
 Hana Financial Group Inc. , South Korea’s fourth-biggest
financial company, reported an unexpected decline in second-
quarter profit on July 19 after provisions against bad loans
increased. Net income fell 8 percent to 180.8 billion won last
quarter, compared with the 220.5 billion won median of 23
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The Financial Supervisory Service said in June that 65
companies must improve finances or restructure loans with
creditors, prompting lenders to set aside combined 2.2 trillion
won in additional reserves.
