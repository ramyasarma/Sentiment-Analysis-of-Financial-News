             Russian farmers reaped 24.6 million
metric tons of wheat as of today, down 700,000 tons from a year
earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.  
 Harvesting of the grain covered 9.6 million hectares (23.7
million acres), 1 million hectares more than last year, the
ministry said today on its website. The average yield dropped to
2.56 tons a hectare from 2.92 tons last year.  
 Russia’s wheat crop may fall 24 percent from the prior year
to as little as 47 million tons because of a drought and lower
yields, the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies said
today. National exports of the grain may almost halve from a
year earlier to 9.5 million tons, said the Moscow-based
institute, also known as IKAR.  
 The overall grain harvest came to 33 million tons as of
today, up 1.6 million tons from last season, as hot weather
accelerated crop-gathering, the ministry said. Reaping of barley
totals 4.2 million tons so far, it said.  
 Russia’s grain harvest may fall below 70 million tons as
yields drop amid the worst drought in at least a decade, Moscow-
based researcher SovEcon said July 27.
