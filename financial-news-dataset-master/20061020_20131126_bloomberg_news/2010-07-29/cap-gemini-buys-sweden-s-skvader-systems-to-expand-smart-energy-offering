             Cap Gemini SA , Europe’s largest
computer services company, bought Sweden’s Skvader Systems AB, a
provider of “smart meter” energy services, to bolster its
energy-management offerings.  
 The cash deal was completed this month and will give Cap
Gemini 25 percent of Sweden’s market for smart meters, Peter
Harris, the company’s head for smart energy services in Europe,
said by phone. He declined to comment on the terms of the deal.  
 Computer services companies are expanding their energy and
environmental operations to take advantage of expected upgrades
and diversify revenue sources.  Atos Origin SA , Europe’s second-
largest computer services provider, this year said it would set
up a subsidiary to focus on high-tech energy networks, which Cap
Gemini is also targeting.  
 Smart meters record energy consumption in smaller intervals
than their conventional counterparts, allowing for more
efficient use. The U.K. government this week  published  proposals
on how the devices will be rolled out across the country.  
 “Sweden is the most mature market in Europe in terms of
adopting smart-meter technology,” Harris said. “We’ll be
looking to leverage it across Europe.”  
 There will be more than 300 million euros ($392 million) in
smart energy service contracts in Nordic countries in the next
three years, according to Cap Gemini.  
 Skvader reported revenue for 2008-2009 of 51.9 million
kronor ($7.2 million) and a pretax profit of 7 million kronor,
according to a filing with the Swedish Companies Registration
Office.
