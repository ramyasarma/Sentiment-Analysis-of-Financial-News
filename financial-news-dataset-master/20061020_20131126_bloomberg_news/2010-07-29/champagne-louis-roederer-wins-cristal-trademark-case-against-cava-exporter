             Champagne Louis Roederer, the maker
of Cristal, won a trademark infringement case against  J. Garcia
Carrion SA  over the labeling of sparkling wine.  
 Roederer began making Cristal champagne after being asked
to produce a wine for Tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1876 and
has been selling it in the U.S. since 1937. Reims, France-based
Roederer sued winemaker Garcia Carrion in 2006, saying the
Spanish company began importing  Cristalino  sparkling wine into
the U.S. long after Cristal was introduced in the country.  
 Garcia Carrion and distributor CIV USA must restrict the
use of the “Cristalino” brand on the products they sell in the
U.S., U.S. District Judge  Joan Ericksen  in Minneapolis said in a
July 27 order.  
 Garcia Carrion may use “Cristalino” only as part of the
phrase “Jaume Serra Cristalino” along with a disclaimer stating
the product isn’t affiliated with Cristal or Roederer, Ericksen
said. She also restricted the use of lettering and colors on
Cristalino bottles.  
 The case is Champagne Louis Roederer v. J. Garcia Carrion
SA, 06-00213, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota.
