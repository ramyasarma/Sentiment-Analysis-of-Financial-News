             U.S.  five- and seven-year notes
traded near the highest levels in a week, both headed for a
fourth consecutive monthly gain, as investors sought safety in
medium-term Treasury debt.  
 The seven-year note rose even after today’s auction of $29
billion of the securities, the last of three note sales this
week that totaled $104 billion, drew lower demand than forecast.
Thirty- and 10-year debt headed for their first monthly losses
since March. A government report tomorrow is forecast to show
U.S. economic growth slowed in the second quarter.  
 “People want to be in the five- and seven-year sectors,”
said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at Bank of Nova
Scotia in New York. “They are reaching for yield and there is
not enough yield in the two-year sector. People are not
extending to the 30-year because they are nervous being caught
out the curve. They are concerned about fiscal policy.”  
 The  yield  on the current seven-year note fell 3 basis
points to 2.36 percent at 5:15 p.m. in New York, according to
BGCantor Market Data. It touched 2.33 percent, the lowest since
July 22, and headed for a monthly drop of 5 basis points.  Five-
year  yields fell 3 basis points to 1.66 percent. They reached
1.65 percent, also the lowest since July 22, and were poised for
an 11 basis-point decrease in July. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 The 30-year  bond yield  rose 1 basis points to 4.08 percent
and touched 4.14 percent, the highest since June 22. It headed
for a 19 basis-point increase for July. The 10-year yield traded
at 2.99 percent, poised for a rise of 6 basis points in July.  
 President  Barack Obama  has increased the U.S. marketable
debt to a record $8.1 trillion as he tries to sustain the
nation’s economic expansion.  
 ‘Belly of the Curve’  
 “The rally in the bond market is being led with the belly
of the curve,” said  Paul Horrmann , a broker in New York at
Tradition Asiel Securities Inc., an interdealer broker. “The new
two-year is the five-year in terms of safety and flight to
quality.”  
 Seven-year notes briefly pared gains today after the
auction of the securities attracted a yield of 2.394 percent,
higher than the 2.375 percent in pre-auction trading. The
condition, called a tail, means the government had to pay a
higher rate to sell the notes.  
 “People got long because they thought the auction was
going to go well,” said  Thomas Simons , a government debt
economist in New York at Jefferies Group Inc., which as a
primary dealer is required to bid at Treasury auctions.
“Everyone was surprised by the weak results of the auction, so
they gave it up because they didn’t have the same sentiment.” A
long position is a bet a security will gain.  
 Smallest Since September  
 Today’s auction was the smallest of seven-year debt since
September. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.78, compared with 3.01 at the last sale, on June 24, and an
average of 2.8 for the past 10 offerings.  
 Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 42.3 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 52.3 percent for the past 10 sales. Direct
bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place bids directly
with the Treasury, bought 9 percent, compared with an average of
9.7 percent at the past 10 auctions.  
 A government auction of $37 billion in five-year notes
yesterday drew a yield of 1.796 percent, compared with an
average forecast of 1.82 percent in a Bloomberg survey of seven
primary dealers.  
 Record Low Yield  
 The Treasury sold $38 billion in two-year debt on July 27
at a record low yield of 0.665 percent.  
 Government bonds fell earlier as a Labor Department report
showed initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped by
11,000 to 457,000 in the week ended July 24, from a revised
468,000 the previous week. A Bloomberg News survey forecast a
decline to 460,000.  
 U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed to 2.6 percent in
the second quarter from 2.7 percent in the previous three
months, according to the median estimate of 81 economists in a
Bloomberg survey before the data are released tomorrow.  
 Fed Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said in a
speech today in San Antonio that the U.S. economy faces a “slow
slog” and further monetary accommodation may not help revive
“dispirited” businesses.  
 St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said in a research
paper the central bank should resume purchases of Treasury
securities if the economy slows and prices fall rather than
maintain a pledge to keep interest rates near zero.
