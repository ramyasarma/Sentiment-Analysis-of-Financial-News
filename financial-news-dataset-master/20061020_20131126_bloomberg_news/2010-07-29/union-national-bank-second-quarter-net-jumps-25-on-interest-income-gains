             Union National Bank PJSC , in which
Abu Dhabi and Dubai own stakes, reported a less-than-expected 25
percent rise in second-quarter profit as higher impairment
charges offset a rise in revenue.  
 Net income advanced to 340 million dirhams ($93 million)
from 271.3 million dirhams, the Abu Dhabi-based bank said in an
e-mailed  statement  today. Profit fell short of the mean estimate
of 369.3 million dirhams in a Bloomberg survey of six analysts.  
 The result reflects the bank’s “prudent approach” and has
helped “strengthen its financial position in the prevailing
prolonged challenging economic cycle,” UNB said.  
 United Arab Emirates’ banks are recovering from the global
credit crisis, which weakened lending and investment banking,
while provisions for bad loans are rising amid the economic
slowdown. U.A.E. economic growth may accelerate to 3.2 percent
in 2010 with oil prices at $85 a barrel from 1.3 percent in
2009, Economy Minister  Sultan Bin Saeed al-Mansouri  said in May.  
 First-half net-interest income rose 22.4 percent from a
year earlier to 946.7 million dirhams and non-interest income 41
percent to 341.4 million dirhams, UNB said. Lending rose 8.1
percent in June from a year earlier.  
 Impairment Loss  
 UNB booked an impairment charge of 216.5 million dirhams as
a “pre-emptive measure” compared with 113.7 million dirhams a
year earlier, according to the bank. The ratio of nonperforming
loans to total loans declined to 1.4 percent at the end of June
from 1.5 percent in December, UNB said.  
 Emirates NBD PJSC , the U.A.E.’s biggest bank by assets,
reported July 26 a worse-than-expected 53 percent decline in
second-quarter profit to 398.2 million dirhams as it set aside
money to cover bad loans including for money lent to state-owned
Dubai World.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , the second-biggest
bank, said July 27 quarterly earnings rose 10.4 percent to 1
billion dirhams, ahead of analysts’ estimates.
