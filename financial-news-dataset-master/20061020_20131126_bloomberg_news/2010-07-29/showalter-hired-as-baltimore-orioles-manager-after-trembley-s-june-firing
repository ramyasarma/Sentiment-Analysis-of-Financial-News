             Buck Showalter , who led the New York
Yankees to the best record in the American League during the
strike-shortened 1994 season, was hired today as the manager of
the Baltimore Orioles.  
 Showalter, 54, a two-time AL Manager of the Year, also
managed the Arizona Diamondbacks and Texas Rangers and has an
882-833 record.  
 The Orioles fired manager  Dave Trembley  on June 4, and  Juan Samuel  has led the club as an interim replacement since then.
The Orioles’ 31-70 record is the worst in baseball.  
 The Orioles announced the signing in a release on their
 website  and said Showalter would take over on Aug. 2.  
 The son of a high-school coach, Showalter was an All-
American baseball player at Mississippi State University before
spending seven seasons in the minor leagues as an outfielder and
first baseman. He never made Major League Baseball as a player.  
 Showalter then spent five seasons managing in the Yankees’
farm system before becoming a coach in New York and replacing
 Stump Merrill  as manager in 1992.  
 He went 313-268 with the Yankees in 1992-95 before owner
 George Steinbrenner  replaced Showalter with  Joe Torre . The
Yankees were 70-43 when a players strike stopped the 1994
season, and reached the playoffs the next year.  
 Showalter was 250-236 with the Diamondbacks in 1998-2000
and 319-329 with Texas in 2003-06. He has since been working as
an analyst with  Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN .
