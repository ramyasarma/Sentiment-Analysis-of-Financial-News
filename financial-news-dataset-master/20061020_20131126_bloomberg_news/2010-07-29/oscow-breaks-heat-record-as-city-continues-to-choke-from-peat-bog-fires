             Moscow set a heat record for the
second time in a week as the Russian capital remained wrapped in
smoke from wildfires on dry peat bogs east of the city.  
 The temperature in Moscow reached 37.8 degrees Celsius (100
degrees Fahrenheit) at 4 p.m. today, exceeding the record of
37.5 degrees set on July 26, Irina Smetanina, spokeswoman for
 Gidromettsentr , the state weather service, said by telephone.
The July 26 reading was the hottest since records began 130
years ago.  
 Moscow also broke the record for electricity consumption --
11,623 megawatts -- at 2 p.m. today, Interfax reported, citing
Vitaly Strugovets, a spokesman for  Moscow United Electric Grid
Company . It was the third such record during the current heat
wave, the news service reported.  
 Firefighters are battling 340 blazes across Russia covering
86,658 hectares (214,136 acres) amid a drought that led the
government to declare weather-related emergencies in 23 crop-
producing regions. Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  said on
July 23 that the drought had damaged 10.1 million hectares, or
32 percent of all land under cultivation.  
 Russia has milled 33 million metric tons of grain,
including 24.6 million tons of wheat, in the year to date,
though yields fell to 23.2 centners per hectare from 28.5
centners a year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said on its
 website  today. A centner is equal to 100 kilograms.  
 Wheat Stocks  
 World wheat stockpiles will decline by the end of June as
drought damages crops in Russia and Kazakhstan, the
International Grains Council said, slashing an outlook for
higher inventories.  
 Stocks will drop to 192 million metric tons at the end of
the 2010-11 crop year from 197 million tons at the end of June
this year, the London-based council said in a monthly report
today.  
 Forty-two fires broke out in Russia overnight in peat bogs
drained for agriculture during the Soviet era, including 39 in
central Russia, according to the  Emergency Situations Ministry .
All but two of the fires were extinguished.  
 Since the start of the fire season, 950,457 hectares have
burned, the ministry said.
