             Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s third-
largest automaker, swung to a first-quarter profit as auto
demand recovered in North America and sales grew in Asia.  
 Nissan posted net income of 106.6 billion yen for the three
months ended June 30, compared with a 16.5 billion yen loss a
year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based company said in a
statement today. The results beat the 58 billion yen average of
three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
