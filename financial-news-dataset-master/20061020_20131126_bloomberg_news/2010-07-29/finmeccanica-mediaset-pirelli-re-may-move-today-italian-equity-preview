             Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB  Index

largest independent fund manager said first-half net income

euros a year earlier. Results were better than expected “due to
higher management fees,” Mediobanca Securities said after the

1.1 percent, to 4.11 euros. UBS AG global strategists raised

valuations, economic data and relief for the banks to boot.”

percent, to 8.32 euros.

oil-transport company posted a second-quarter net loss of $5.5
million euros compared with a 1.4 million-euro loss a year
earlier. DnB NOR Markets said that “the second quarter showed
an improvement from the first quarter,” though the stock
remains expensive and it reiterated a “sell” rating.  
 Finmeccanica SpA  (FNC IM) dropped for the first time this
week, losing 32.5 cents, or 3.7 percent, to 8.48 euros. Italy’s
biggest defense company said first-half net income fell to 170
million euros from 218 million euros a year earlier. “We have
some difficulties in determining which catalysts might have a
positive impact on the share price in the coming months,”
Kepler Capital Markets said in a note. The brokerage reiterated
a “reduce” rating.  
 Geox SpA  (GEO IM) advanced 30 cents, or 7.5 percent, to
4.31 euros, the biggest gain in five months. “Second-quarter
figures were better than expected,” Cheuvreux said in a note.  
 The shoemaker said today that first-half net income fell to
37.9 million euros from 56.6 million euros in the same period
last year. Revenue fell to 435.5 million euros from 482.9
million euros.

to 11.28 euros, ending a two-day loss. Banca IMI reiterated a
“buy” rating on the lottery company before the release of
second-quarter figures after the market closed. Earnings rose 59
percent to 34.9 million euros. “On one hand, lotto wagers
continue to be weak, but on the other, new businesses continue
to be strong,” the brokerage said in a note.  
 Piaggio & C. SpA  (PIA IM) advanced 10 cents, or 4.9

in the underlying business.”
