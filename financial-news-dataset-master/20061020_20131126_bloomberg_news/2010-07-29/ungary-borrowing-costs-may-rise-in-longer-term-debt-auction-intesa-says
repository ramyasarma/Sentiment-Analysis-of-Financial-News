             Hungary raised more funds than
planned at its first auction of debt maturing in three or more
years since the breakdown of talks with international lenders, a
sign the country can meet its financing needs for now.  
 The government raised 57.5 billion forint ($265.4 million)
compared with a target of 50 billion forint, according to
auction results on the debt management agency’s Bloomberg page.
Investors submitted bids worth 147.3 billion forint. Yields on
three-year debt rose while five and 15-year bond yields dropped,
compared with previous auctions.  
 “It appears the market showed its trust in Hungary, which
is absolutely reassuring,” said  Istvan Horvath , who helps
manage $3.7 billion at the Budapest investment unit of KBC Groep
NV. “The auction results support the government’s stance that
Hungary can rely solely on market financing for now.”  
 The International Monetary Fund and the European Union
ended talks with the government on July 17 without endorsing
Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s fiscal plans. Hungary wants to
return to economic “self-rule” to jumpstart its economy, Orban
said on July 23. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service
said last week they may downgrade the country’s debt rating.  
 “The key takeaway from today’s sale is that the debt
management agency is trying to front-load its issuance wherever
possible given that it has zero clarity around fiscal policy in
the second half,” said  Peter Attard Montalto , an economist at
Nomura Plc in London.  
 Yields  
 The government today sold 20 billion forint of bonds due in
2014 at an average yield of 7.13 percent, compared with 6.92
percent on July 15, according to auction results on the debt
management agency’s Bloomberg page. It sold 22.5 billion forint
of 2016 notes at 7.14 percent versus 7.22 percent, also on July
15, and 15 billion forint of 2023 bonds at 7.09 percent compared
with 7.10 percent on May 6.  
 The yield on benchmark 6.75 percent 2013 bonds on the
secondary market dropped nine basis points to 6.88 percent at
12:32 p.m. in Budapest. The yield rose to 7.28 percent on July
19, its highest since Jan. 5, two days after loan talks ended.  
 “Today’s auction will be a barometer of investors’
sentiment toward Hungary,” said  Gyorgy Barta , a Budapest-based
economist at Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo, before the results were
issued.  
 ‘Temporary Breather’  
 At a sale of three-month Treasury bills this week, the
government raised 5 billion forint more that the 45 billion
forint planned.  
 “The government has been given a temporary breather but
the IMF-EU story is far from over,” Barta said. Uncertainty is
likely to prevail on domestic markets until the government
unveils its fiscal plans for 2011, expected after municipal
election on Oct. 3, he said.  
 The forint is the worst-performing currency against the
euro among emerging European currencies in the past three
months, having lost 6.1 percent since April 29. The currency
traded lost 0.3 percent to 283.38 per euro today, compared with
282.66 late yesterday.  
 On July 19, the forint fell to the lowest since April 2009.
Central bank President  Andras Simor  said interest rates may rise
in case of a sustained increase in risk premiums. S&P on July 23
lowered the outlook on Hungary’s debt to “negative,” saying it
may cut the nation’s credit rating to junk from investment
grade.
