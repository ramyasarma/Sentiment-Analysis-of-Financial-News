             The shekel strengthened against the
dollar heading for its biggest monthly gain in a year as the
Bank of Israel’s interest rate increase boosted demand for the
currency.  
 The central bank unexpectedly raised its benchmark interest
rate on July 26 to 1.75 percent, widening the gap to rates in
the U.S. The Federal Reserve at its last decision in June kept
rates at a record low, in a range of zero to 0.25 percent.  
 The shekel strengthened as much as 1 percent to 3.7778
per dollar, the highest intraday level since May 19. The
currency traded at 3.7795 at 6:01 p.m. in Tel Aviv. It has
gained 1.9 percent this week and has risen 2.8 percent this
month.  
 “Demand for the shekel is rising,” said  Arie Tal , chief
strategist at Alumot-Sprint Investment House Ltd. in Herzliya,
near Tel Aviv. The interest rate increase “widened the gap
between local interest rates and the Federal Reserve’s rates,
pushing demand for the local currency.”  
 Government bonds rose, pushing the yield on the benchmark
10-year notes to a record low, as concern the global economic
recovery is faltering spurred demand for the relative safety of
fixed-income securities.  
 “As concern for global and local slowdown increases,
investors shift their money to solid and safer assets,” Tal
said.  
 U.S. economic growth slackened in some areas over the past
two months, dragged down by commercial real estate and the
expiration of a tax credit for homebuyers, the Fed said
yesterday in its Beige Book business survey.  
 The 10-year Mimshal Shiklit due January 2020 rose 0.44
shekel to the 106.46 at the 4:30 p.m. close, driving the yield
six basis points lower to 4.47 percent, the lowest level since
they were sold in November.
