             Goodman Group , Australia’s largest
industrial real estate investment trust, said it is interested
in becoming the manager of  ING Industrial Fund , in which it owns
a 4.4 percent stake.  
 The company has not had detailed discussions with ING Real
Estate, and there is no certainty the transaction will happen,
it said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.  
 “Goodman believes that this would be a prudent expansion
of its fund management business,” it said in the statement.  
 Sydney-based Goodman would keep the ING fund as a separate
listed vehicle rather than merge it with its existing funds, it
said.  
 Goodman  shares  slipped 0.8 percent to 64 Australian cents
at 10:55 a.m. in Sydney.  ING Industrial Fund  added 2.2 percent
to 46 Australian cents.
