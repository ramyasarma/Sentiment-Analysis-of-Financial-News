             The northern Chinese city of Jilin
ended a one-day stoppage of the water supply, the Xinhua News
Agency reported, citing an unidentified person at the local
water company.  
 The water was turned off shortly after 3,000 chemical-
filled barrels were swept into the Songhua river by a flood
yesterday, the report said.
