             McDonald’s Corp ., the world’s
largest restaurant chain, sold the cheapest 10-year debt in the
U.S. bond market in at least 15 years yesterday, as borrowers
tap investor demand for new issues and absolute yields on
investment-grade debt fell to the lowest since March 2004.  
 The company placed $450 million of 3.5 percent, 10-year
notes and $300 million of 4.875 percent, 30-year bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 10-year note has
the lowest coupon of any issuer since 1995, including AAA rated
 Johnson & Johnson , and the 30-year bond ties for the least with
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  
 McDonald’s joins  Kimberly-Clark Corp. ,  Wal-Mart  and  Duke
Energy Corp.  in paying the lowest interest on 10-year debt since
1995 through issues in the past four weeks, the bank’s data
show. Companies are selling debt “not necessarily earmarked for
a specific need,” said  Dan Mead , a managing director of U.S.
investment-grade debt syndicate at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.  
 Issuers are “taking advantage of record-low coupons right
now,” Mead, who helped manage Oak Brook, Illinois-based
McDonald’s sale, said in a telephone interview. “It’s a pretty
interesting time right now because you’re looking at record-low
Treasury rates coupled with credit spreads near all-time lows,
so it’s a good combination for issuers.”  
 Yields Decline  
 The average yield on investment-grade corporate debt fell
to 4.1 percent yesterday, the lowest since March 24, 2004,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Corporate
Master index. Treasury  10-year yields  have been within 5 basis
points of 3 percent for the past week. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 The fifth-lowest rate on 10-year bonds since 1995 was paid
in May 2003 by  Johnson & Johnson , Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data show, one of four nonfinancial U.S. companies rated AAA by
Standard & Poor’s. That’s the same grade it assigns to U.S.
government debt. The world’s largest maker of health products
sold 3.8 percent notes at the time, Bloomberg data show.  
 Mead said he expects increased issuance from industrials,
as companies take advantage of rates today “when a month ago,
they probably weren’t planning on doing a bond deal,” he said.  
 Companies have issued $84.7 billion of debt this month,
making it the busiest July since at least 1998, Bloomberg data
show.  
 Investor Outlook  
 Current yields may not satisfy all investors, said  Dan Sheppard , a New York-based director in fixed-income at Deutsche
Bank AG’s Private Wealth Management unit, where he helps oversee
$12 billion.  
 “The 10-year part of the curve right now, with spreads as
tight as they are on some of the new investment-grade names, I’m
not too sure you’re missing that much if you don’t get
involved,” he said.  
 McDonald’s 3.5 percent debt due in 2020 traded at 99.522
cents on the dollar at 1:55 p.m. to yield 3.558 percent, or 54.7
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. It sold yesterday at a yield of 3.548
percent, or a 55 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show.  
 “We’re taking advantage of favorable conditions and
extremely favorable rates,” Lizzie Roscoe, a McDonald’s
spokeswoman, said of yesterday’s offering in an e-mail.
