             Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s
real estate firm paid $44 million for a townhome on Manhattan’s
Fifth Avenue, adding to his property holdings in New York.  
 Slim, the world’s richest man according to Forbes magazine,
considers the house an investment and won’t live there, said his
spokesman,  Arturo Elias . The closely held firm that bought the
building has co-investors, Elias said, declining to name them.
The price was disclosed in New York property records.  
 Slim, who has invested in Mexican real estate for decades,
snapped up the property as Manhattan housing prices climb. The
median price for luxury apartments in New York, defined as the
top 10 percent of the market by value, rose 12 percent to almost
$4.1 million in the second quarter from a year earlier,
according to data compiled by appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and
brokerage Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate.  
 Inmobiliaria Carso SA, a closely held investment vehicle
for Slim’s family, bought an office tower at 417 Fifth Ave. last
month for $140 million. Inmobiliaria Carso is also the biggest
 shareholder  in Saks Inc., whose properties include its Fifth
Avenue flagship store. Slim, 70, has said he bought shares of
the retailer because of the value of its real estate holdings.  
 Slim’s firm went into contract for the townhome on July 16,
and the deal closed five days later, according to records on
file with the New York City Department of Finance.  
 Duke Semans Mansion  
 The house at 1009 Fifth Ave., known as the Duke Semans
Mansion, was listed for sale in January for $50 million,
according to listings website  StreetEasy.com . The previous owner
bought it in 2006 for $40 million, StreetEasy data show.  
 The townhouse was declared a city landmark in 1974,
according to the property listing by brokerage Brown Harris
Stevens. The Wall Street Journal reported the building’s sale
yesterday.  
 Slim’s real-estate investments follow in the footsteps of
his father, a Lebanese immigrant who acquired property in
downtown Mexico City after the Mexican Revolution. The
billionaire’s properties in Mexico, held through  Grupo Carso
SAB , include shopping and office complexes, hospitals and
educational campuses.
