             Petroleos Mexicanos, Latin America’s
largest oil producer, may get enough Congressional support to
increase its budget by 54 percent to a record next year,
lawmakers from the country’s three largest parties said.  
 “We see this favorably as long as Pemex’s budget
prioritizes investment,”  David Penchyna , one of two ranking
members from the Institutional Revolutionary Party in the lower
house, said today in an interview at Bloomberg’s Mexico City
office. “We want a clear, sharp proposal from Pemex that
focuses on investment and cuts operating expenses.”  
 Mexico, the second-largest oil supplier to the U.S., aims
to boost oil output to 3.3 million barrels a day by 2024. State-
owned Pemex presented a budget proposal of 400 billion pesos
($31 billion) for 2011 to the Finance Ministry,  Hector Moreira ,
a company board member, said July 19.  
 “No one in their right mind would oppose a budget
increase,” Armando Rios, a lawmaker for the opposition Party of
the Democratic Revolution, said in the same interview. The only
problem would be if the proposal increases “expenditures for
the union or the company current account,” he said.  
 “We don’t see any problem with a budget increase for
Pemex,” Carlos Alberto Perez, minority whip from President
Felipe Calderon’s National Action Party, said in the same
interview.  
 After evaluation by the Finance Ministry, the 2011 proposal
must be submitted to Congress as part of the government’s budget
plan scheduled to be voted on by Nov. 15.
