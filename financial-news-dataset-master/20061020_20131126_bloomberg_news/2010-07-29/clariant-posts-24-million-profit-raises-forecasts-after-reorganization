             Clariant AG , the world’s biggest
maker of printing-ink chemicals, raised its target for improving
margins after job cuts and a shift in production to Asia helped
the company return to a second-quarter profit.  
 Net income totaled 25 million Swiss francs ($23.7 million)
compared with a loss of 61 million francs, the Muttenz,
Switzerland-based company said today in a statement. Analysts in
a Bloomberg survey predicted 22 million francs. Sales rose 18
percent to 1.89 billion francs.  
 “The economic tailwind leveraged the results of our
restructuring program,” Chief Executive Officer Hariolf
Kottmann said in the statement.  
 Clariant aims to widen its operating profit margin to above
8 percent and is seeking to boost sales in local currencies by a
“high single-digit” amount. The Swiss company is moving
production of textile dyes from its homeland to Asia and
shifting paper-chemical manufacturing to Spain.  
 Kottmann closed sites and eliminated more than 2,500 jobs
last year to cut costs as the global recession hit demand for
chemicals used in dyes, plastic additives and pigments.  
 The stock  has risen 18 percent this year, while the 15-
member Bloomberg Europe Chemicals Index decreased 2.3 percent.
