             Copper declined from the highest
level in 12 weeks as an unexpected drop in orders for durable
goods in the U.S. raised concerns about the strength of economic
recovery and the outlook for metals demand.  
 Copper for delivery in three months declined as much as 0.6
percent to $7,126 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $7,161 at 11:43 a.m. in Shanghai. The metal ended
yesterday at $7,170 a ton, the highest close since April 30.
Lead lost 0.9 percent to $2,000 a ton.  
 Orders for durable goods in the U.S. fell 1 percent in June
from a month ago, while economists predicted an increase for the
sixth time in seven months. The U.S. is the second-largest
consumer of copper, used in buildings and appliances.  
 “The second monthly decline in U.S. durable orders
affirmed a slowdown in manufacturing expansion,”  Tan Wentao , an
analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co., said from Shanghai today.  
 Copper for October delivery in Shanghai fell 0.2 percent to
56,140 yuan ($8,283) a ton at 11:30 a.m. local-time break.  
 “Local consumption is still relatively weak, as indicated
by fabricators’ sluggish buying and imports data,” said Lai
Qiwen, an analyst at Guantong Futures. Refined-copper imports by
China fell for a third month in June.  
 Aluminum in London decreased 0.2 percent to $2,065 a ton,
zinc and nickel were little changed at $1,953 and $20,390 a ton,
respectively. Tin hadn’t traded as of 11:41 a.m. in Singapore.
