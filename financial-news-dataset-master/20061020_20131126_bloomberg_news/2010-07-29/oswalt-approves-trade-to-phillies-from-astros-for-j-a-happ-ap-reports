             All-Star pitcher Roy Oswalt has
accepted a trade to the Philadelphia Phillies from the Houston
Astros in exchange for a package including pitcher J.A. Happ,
the Associated Press reported.  
 AP, citing a person with knowledge of the deal, said the
Phillies would also send the Astros at least two prospects. It
said Oswalt still must pass a physical.
