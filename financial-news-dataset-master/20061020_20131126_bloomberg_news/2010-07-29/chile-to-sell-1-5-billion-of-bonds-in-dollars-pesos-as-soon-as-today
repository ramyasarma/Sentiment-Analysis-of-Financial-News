             Chile sold $1.5 billion of 10-year
dollar and peso bonds in the country’s first international
offering in six years.  
 The country issued $1 billion of bonds to yield 90 basis
points, or 0.9 percentage point, above U.S. Treasuries and $520
million of peso notes to yield 5.5 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Chile sold the bonds to help cover the $8.4 billion cost of
rebuilding from a February earthquake. Moody’s Investors Service
in June lifted the country’s rating to Aa3, the fourth-highest
investment grade. Standard & Poor’s ranks it one level lower at
A+.  
 The yield on Chile’s 5.5 percent dollar bonds due in 2013
fell eight basis points to 1.69 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields have dropped 18
basis points this year.  
 Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
managed the sale, said the person, who declined to be identified
because terms aren’t set.
