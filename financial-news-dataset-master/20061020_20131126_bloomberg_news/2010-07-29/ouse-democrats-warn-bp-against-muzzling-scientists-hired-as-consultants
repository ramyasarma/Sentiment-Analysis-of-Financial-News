             House Democrats investigating the
Gulf of Mexico oil spill warned  BP Plc  against suppressing
scientific analysis by its consultants.  
 House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman  Henry Waxman ,
a California Democrat, and  Edward Markey , a Massachusetts
Democrat, raised concern that the company is imposing
confidentiality agreements with scientists in a letter to BP
America Chief Executive Officer  Lamar McKay .  
 “Any effort to muzzle scientists or shield their findings
under doctrines of legal privileges could seriously impede the
recovery,” the lawmakers wrote today in their letter. “The
disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is not a private matter.”  
 The House committee is investigating the April 20 spill
triggered by the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig leased
by BP. The Democrats said blocking disclosure of information
could impede investigators.  
 Waxman and Markey requested that BP executives brief them
by Aug. 6 on their retention of “third-party consultants,
academics and scientists” to assess the environmental and
health impacts of the spill. They also sought copies of
contracts with academic experts and consultants by Aug. 12.  
 The committee on May 28 sought documents from clean-up
consultants working for BP and drilling rig operator Transocean
Ltd. as part of the investigation.
