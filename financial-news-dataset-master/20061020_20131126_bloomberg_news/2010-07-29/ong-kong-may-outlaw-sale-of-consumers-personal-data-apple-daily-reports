             Hong Kong Privacy Commissioner
Roderick Woo proposed introducing a law to make it a criminal
offence for companies to sell customers’ personal data, after
Octopus Holdings Ltd. sold clients’ information for HK$44
million, Apple Daily reported.  
 Woo will finish a preliminary report on the Octopus case
before his term ends July 31, the Hong Kong-based Chinese-
language newspaper said, citing the commissioner.  
 Octopus cards are used like electronic cash by millions of
Hong Kong people making purchases such as train tickets, fast-
food meals and convenience store products.
