             Thomson Reuters Corp. , the financial
news and information provider, reported second-quarter  profit 
dropped 7.9 percent after sales of its trading and advisory
products declined.  
 Net income fell to $290 million, or 35 cents a share, from
$315 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. Excluding some items, profit
dropped to 47 cents a share from 58 cents. Analysts projected 49
cents, the average of 12  estimates compiled  by Bloomberg.  
 Revenue declined 6 percent at the sales and trading and
investment and advisory units, which together account for almost
half of the  total . Chief Executive Officer  Tom Glocer  said he
expects the company to return to sales growth this quarter.  
 Total second-quarter sales fell 2.3 percent to $3.22
billion, compared with the $3.23 billion average analyst
estimate.  
 In its tax and accounting and its enterprise divisions,
Thomson Reuters posted sales gains of 8 percent and 4 percent,
respectively.  
 Thomson Reuters dropped 74 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
C$38.96 at 4:10 p.m. New York time  in trading  on the Toronto
Stock Exchange, for the largest one-day decline since May 20.
The shares advanced 15 percent this year.
