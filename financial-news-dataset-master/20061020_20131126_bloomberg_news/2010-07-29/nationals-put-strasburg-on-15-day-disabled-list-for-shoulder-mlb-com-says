             The Washington Nationals placed
rookie pitcher Stephen Strasburg on the 15-day disabled list so
he can recover from a inflamed shoulder, MLB.com reported,
citing a person in baseball.  
 Strasburg, 22, will not throw for three or four days, then
the shoulder will be re-evaluated, MLB.com said. The righthander
signed a record $15 million contract as the first overall draft
pick in 2009. He is 5-2 with a 2.32 earned run average.
