             Fiat SpA can invest in its Italian
car factories if there aren’t “new obstacles every day” to the
plan from unions, Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne
wrote in a letter to daily Il Sole 24 Ore.  
 The company decided to build new models in Serbia because
of a tight timeline and labor problems in Italy, the CEO said.
“Given the uncertainties” in Fiat’s home market, “it was
impossible to think of locating this project in Italy.”
