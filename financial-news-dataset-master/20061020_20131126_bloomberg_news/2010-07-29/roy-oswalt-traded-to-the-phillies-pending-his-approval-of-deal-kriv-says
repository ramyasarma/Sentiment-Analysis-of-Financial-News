             Right-handed pitcher  Roy Oswalt  will
move to the Philadelphia Phillies from the Houston Astros if he
approves a trade worked out by the two teams, KRIV-TV reported.  
 Oswalt, 32, must waive a no-trade clause in his contract
for the deal to go through, the Houston television station said,
citing unidentified people in Major League Baseball. The Astros
will take on an undisclosed portion of Oswalt’s contract, which
will pay him $5 million for the remainder of this season and $16
million next year.  
 Oswalt, a three time All-Star, has a 3.12 earned run
average and 117 strikeouts this year. He has a 6-11 record for
Houston, which is  17 games under .500  at 42-59. The Phillies,
the defending National League champions, are 55-46 and 3½ games
behind the Atlanta Braves in the NL East Division.
