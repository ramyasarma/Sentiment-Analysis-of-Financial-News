             Brazil’s monthly inflation as
measured by the  IGP-M price  index rose 0.15 percent in July, the
Getulio Vargas Foundation said in a statement on its website.  
 Economists had been forecasting prices to jump by 0.05
percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of 24 analysts. It was the second-straight month that Brazil’s
broadest price index slowed, after falling to 0.85 percent in
June from 1.19 percent in May.  
 Wholesale prices, which have a 60 percent weighting in the
index, rose 0.2 percent compared with a 1.09 percent increase in
June. Consumer prices fell 0.17 percent, the second straight
month of deflation, led by a 1.05 percent drop in food costs.  
 Inflation  jumped 5.79 percent from a year ago, the Rio de
Janeiro-based university said.  
 The IGP-M index is widely used in Brazil to regulate price
adjustments in rental contacts and utility services.  
 Policy makers increased the overnight rate by 0.50
percentage point to 10.75 percent last week, surprising 48 of 51
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg who expected them to lift the
 Selic  by 0.75 percentage point as in its previous two meetings.
