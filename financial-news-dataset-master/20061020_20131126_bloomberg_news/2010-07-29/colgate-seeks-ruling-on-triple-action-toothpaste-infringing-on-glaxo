             Colgate-Palmolive Co. asked a
federal court to rule that its new “Triple Action” toothpaste
doesn’t infringe trademarks of  GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s  competing
product, Aquafresh.  
 Colgate said in its complaint that consumers won’t be
confused by similarities between the two toothpastes. The
company also argued Glaxo didn’t assert trademarks on the
product in the past, signaling that it recognizes the tri-color
design and marketing slogan “Triple Protection” aren’t
“source identifying.”  
 Colgate’s request for a ruling came in response to
GlaxoSmithKline’s applications for new trademarks for Aquafresh,
which Colgate’s complaint called “a shot across the bow”
showing its intent to gain exclusive rights to the so-called
nurdle design. A nurdle is a small portion of toothpaste. The
New York-based company asked the court in Manhattan to cancel
those marks.  
 “More than 20 years ago, GSK’s Aquafresh brand created the
highly distinctive nurdle device to promote its range of
Aquafresh oral care products,” Glaxo spokeswoman Deborah
Bolding said in an e-mailed statement. “These extremely
valuable trademarks are the exclusive property of
GlaxoSmithKline’s world famous Aquafresh brand and
GlaxoSmithKline will take all necessary steps to defend its
rights.”  
 Glaxo filed the new trademark applications for the nurdle
design after it raised objections with Colgate about the
branding of Colgate’s new product, according to the complaint.  
 “GSK threatened litigation against Colgate concerning the
trademarks,”  Brendan O’Rourke , the lawyer for Colgate, said in
the complaint.  
 Colgate-Palmolive fell $6.12, or 7.3 percent, to $77.75 at
3:07 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
GlaxoSmithKline dropped 33 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $35.11.  
 The case is Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC,
10-5728, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manahattan).
