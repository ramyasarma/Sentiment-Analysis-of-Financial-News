             India’s food inflation slowed for a
second week as monsoon rains enabled farmers to plant more rice,
cotton and soybeans.  
 An  index  measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products compiled by the commerce ministry rose 9.67 percent in
the week ended July 17 from a year earlier, according to a
statement released in New Delhi today. It gained 12.47 percent
the previous week.  
 Heavy showers over most parts of the country in recent days
prompted Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  yesterday to say that grain
output this year would exceed last year’s. Opposition lawmakers
disrupted parliament proceedings this week, criticizing Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh  for rising prices.  
 “Food inflation will decline for sure because of adequate
rain,”  Jay Shankar , the Mumbai-based chief economist at
Religare Capital Markets Ltd., said before the report.  
 The June-September monsoon rains are the main source of
irrigation in India.  
 Reserve Bank of India  Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao , who raised
interest rates this week for the fourth time since mid-March,
said rains will play a key role in the central bank’s efforts to
slow the benchmark wholesale-price inflation to 6 percent by
March from 10.55 percent now.  
 Subbarao raised the reverse repurchase rate by half a
percentage point to 4.5 percent and the repurchase rate to 5.75
percent from 5.5 percent.
