             BASF SE , the world’s biggest
chemical company, reported second-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates on a recovery in demand and higher prices
for products including plastics and catalysts.  
 Net income rose to 1.18 billion euros ($1.5 billion)
compared with 343 million euros a year earlier, the
Ludwigshafen, Germany-based company said in a statement today.
The median estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was
1.07 billion euros.  
 BASF said the strength of the rebound in demand helped it
surpass expectations. The maker of pesticides and polymers
reiterated a forecast that sales growth this year will
outperform the wider chemical industry and that earnings will
increase “considerably.”  
 “A strong performance in the chemicals activities yet
again, driven by supply constraints,”  Annett Weber , an analyst
at BHF-Bank, said in a note. “BASF was able to largely pass on
higher feedstock costs.”  
 The German chemical maker rose 0.9 percent to 45.72 euros
at 2:43 p.m. in Frankfurt trading.  
 Investors are mainly focused on the outlook, and BASF’s
reiteration of its guidance could hamper the short-term upside,
said  Ronald Kohler , an analyst at MainFirst Bank AG.  
 BASF signaled that it may resume dividend growth. Chief
Executive Officer  Juergen Hambrecht  said in the statement that
he expects the company to earn a premium on its cost of capital,
his prerequisite for maintaining or boosting dividends.  
 Sales advanced to 16.2 billion euros from 12.5 billion
euros, with demand rising across most of the company’s
businesses.
