             Mark Hughes  was hired as coach of
English Premier League soccer club Fulham to replace  Roy Hodgson , who left to join Liverpool after guiding the London
team to last season’s Europa League final.  
 Hughes, 46, was appointed on a two-year contract and will
be presented as manager Aug. 3, Fulham said last night on its
website. His first match in charge will be the exhibition
against Germany’s Werder Bremen four days later.  
 “I am joining on the back of two of the most successful
seasons in the club’s history,” Hughes said in a  statement  on
the website. “I am confident that with some additions to the
squad, hard work and commitment, we can move this club forward
in the right direction.”   
 Welshman Hughes, a former Manchester United, Barcelona and
Chelsea striker, had been without a coaching job since getting
fired by Manchester City on Dec. 19. He also managed the Wales
national team and Blackburn Rovers.  
 His first Premier League game with Fulham will be away to
Bolton on Aug. 14. The Cottagers then host Manchester United six
days later.  
 Fulham chairman  Mohamed Al Fayed , who had first tried to
hire Ajax coach  Martin Jol  to replace Hodgson, said in the
statement that Hughes will be “a great guy” for the job.  
 “I know that he understands my vision for the club and
believes in what we want to achieve,” Al Fayed said.
