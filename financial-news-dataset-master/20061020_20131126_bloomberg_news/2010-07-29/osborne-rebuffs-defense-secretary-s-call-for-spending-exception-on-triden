             U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne rebuffed calls from Defense Secretary Liam Fox to
allow the nation’s nuclear submarine deterrent Trident to be
exempted from the defense ministry’s core budget.  
 “The Trident costs, I have made it absolutely clear, are
part of the defense budget,” Osborne said in an interview in
Delhi today. “All budgets have pressure. I don’t think that’s
anything particularly unique about the ministry of defense. I
have made it very clear that trident renewal costs must
be taken as part of the defense budget.”
