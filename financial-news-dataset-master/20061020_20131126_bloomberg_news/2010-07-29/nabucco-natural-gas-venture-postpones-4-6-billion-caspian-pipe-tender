             The Nabucco pipeline venture to
transport natural gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe has
postponed a 3.5 billion-euro ($4.6 billion) July tender for
pipes after receiving more prequalification bids than expected.  
 “We had more participants than expected and the site
visits continue to take place during the summer,” Gabriele
Egartner, a spokeswoman for Nabucco in Vienna, said in an e-
mailed statement today. “The tender will follow as soon as we
have checked the full list of applicants,” with tender dates
yet to be announced.  
 Nabucco had said in April that it was planning to carry out
the tender for long-lead items including line pipes, valves and
bends in July. The venture, which is headed by Austria’s  OMV AG 
and will need about 2 million tons of steel, got more than 60
prequalification bids from companies, Vlad Pavlovschi, general
manager of Nabucco Gas Pipeline Romania SRL, said in May. The
applications are being evaluated by an independent auditor, he
said, declining to provide more details.  
 The 7.9 billion-euro pipeline is planned to stretch more
than 3,300 kilometers (2,050 miles) from Turkey to Austria to
send gas to Europe and reduce the region’s dependence on Russia.  
 The venture partners, which also include Budapest-based  Mol
Nyrt. , Germany’s  RWE AG , Bulgargaz EAD, Romania’s Transgaz SA
and Ankara-based Botas, will decide on the investment by the end
of this year. Construction is set to begin in 2011 and shipments
may start by the end of 2014 or early 2015, according to
Nabucco’s website.
