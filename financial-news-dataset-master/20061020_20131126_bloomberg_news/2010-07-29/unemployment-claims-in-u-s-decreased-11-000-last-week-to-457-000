             The number of Americans filing
first-time claims for  unemployment  insurance fell to 457,000
last week, a figure that signals the labor market will be slow
to improve even as the economy grows.  
 Initial jobless claims dropped by 11,000 in the week ended
July 24 from a revised 468,000, Labor Department figures showed
today in Washington. Applications were in line with the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The number of people
receiving unemployment benefits rose, while those getting
extended payments declined.  
 Limited job gains may restrain consumer spending,
underscoring forecasts the recovery will cool in the second
half. A slowing in the pace of economic growth as seen by
companies such as International Paper Co. may dissuade
businesses from adding to payrolls.  
 “The underlying pace of claims has not made any measurable
improvement,” said  Ellen Zentner , senior U.S. macro economist
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. “Businesses
are investing in equipment but other than that there’s little
impetus” for them to hire, she said.  
 Economists forecast claims would fall to 460,000, from a
previously reported 464,000 for the prior week, according to the
median of 42 projections in a Bloomberg survey. Estimates ranged
from 445,000 to 500,000.  
 Stocks fell as earnings and forecasts that disappointed
investors at technology and consumer-dependent companies wiped
out an early advance. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped
0.4 percent to 1,101.53 at the 4 p.m. close in New York. The
yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.98 percent from
2.99 percent late yesterday.  
 Four-Week Average  
 The four-week moving average of claims, a less-volatile
measure, dropped to 452,500 last week, the lowest since May 8,
from 457,000, today’s report showed.  
 The number of people  continuing to collect  unemployment
benefits rose to 4.565 million in the week ended July 17, from
4.484 million the prior week.  
 The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  
 Those who’ve used up traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
269,000 to 3.66 million in the week ended July 10.  
 President Barack Obama on July 22 signed into law a measure
restoring unemployment benefits that were cut off. The bill
provides retroactive aid to those whose checks were cut off when
benefits expired June 2, while extending through November a
program offering up to 99 weeks of assistance.  
 States and Territories  
 The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, rose to 3.6 percent in
the week ended July 17 from 3.5 percent in the prior week.
Thirty-seven states and territories reported a decrease in
claims during that period, while 16 reported an increase.  
 Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates. That relationship has broken down in
recent months as some companies continue to cut staff, while
others expand, pointing to an uneven recovery.  
 “The economy is growing, no question about it,”  John Faraci , chief executive officer at International Paper, said in
an interview yesterday on Bloomberg Television. “We just see
the rate of growth in the third quarter not quite as robust or
as strong as the second quarter. Things are slowing but they’re
still positive.”  
 United Technologies Corp. said July 26 it expects
restructuring actions from the first half of the year to result
in job cuts of about 2,400 hourly and salaried employees. The
maker of carrier, Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky products, had
eliminated 900 jobs as of June 30 and is targeting most of the
rest of the reductions for 2010 and 2011.  
 Jobs Report  
 The Labor Department is scheduled to release its July
payrolls report on Aug. 6. In June, private employers added
fewer workers than economists had forecast, while overall
payrolls fell, reflecting a drop in federal census workers.  
 The Federal Reserve, in its Beige Book business survey
released yesterday, said employment has “improved gradually in
several Districts,” though “modestly.” Some of the Fed’s 12
districts indicated an increase in demand for temporary workers.  
 Local governments may cut almost 500,000 jobs through next
year to cope with sliding property taxes, a decline in state and
federal aid and added need for social services, according to a
report from the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference
of Mayors and National Association of Counties. The cuts would
amount to 8.6 percent of their 2009 workforces, the group said
July 27.
