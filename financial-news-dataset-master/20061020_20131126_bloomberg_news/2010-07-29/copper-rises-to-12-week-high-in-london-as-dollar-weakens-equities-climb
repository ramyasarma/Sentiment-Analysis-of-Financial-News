             Copper rose to a 12-week high on
speculation that the global economy will be resilient and metal
demand will improve.  
 The European Commission said today that  confidence  in the
region’s economic outlook rose in July to the highest level in
more than two years. The number of Americans filing first-time
jobless  claims  fell last week, government data showed. Copper
has gained 12 percent this month.  
 “We’re heavily invested in the base metals as a play on
the economic recovery,” said  Christian Wagner , who helps
oversee $150 million as chief investment officer of Longview
Capital Management in Wilmington, Delaware.  
 Copper futures for September delivery gained 4.45 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $3.29 a pound at 1:16 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $3.297, the highest level for a
most-active contract since May 4.  
 The dollar dropped as much as 0.8 percent against a basket
of six currencies, boosting the appeal of commodities as
alternative assets.  
 “The markets are ready for a rally and are looking for
reasons,” said  Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt.  
 Copper for delivery in three months rose 0.8 percent to
$7,230 a metric ton ($3.28 a pound) on the London Metal
Exchange.  
 Aluminum, tin, nickel, lead and zinc also gained.
