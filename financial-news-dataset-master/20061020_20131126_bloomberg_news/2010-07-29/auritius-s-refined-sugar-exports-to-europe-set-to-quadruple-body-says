             Mauritius will boost its exports of
refined sugar to the European Union to 320,000 metric tons this
year, following the Indian Ocean island nation’s moves to
increase processing of the sweetener.  
 The shipments will increase from 78,000 tons in 2009, said
Devesh Dukhira, chief marketing officer of the Mauritius Sugar
Syndicate based in the capital, Port Louis.  
 Mauritius will be the biggest exporter of processed sugar
to Europe among the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of
countries, Dukhira said in an interview today.  
 In 2009,  Omnicane Ltd.  and  Flacq United Estates Ltd.  opened
refineries to boost processing in Mauritius, sub-Saharan
Africa’s fourth-biggest sugar grower.  
 Total production is expected to decline 3.7 percent this
year to 450,000 tons, the country’s Chamber of Agriculture said
June 7.  
 The sugar syndicate signed a six-year deal, which started
in 2009, to sell its white refined sugar in Europe through
Germany’s  Suedzucker AG , Dukhira said.
