             Socovesa SA  fell in Santiago
trading, leading declines by Chilean construction companies,
after Santiago home sales fell to a nine-year low.  
 Socovesa lost 3.6 percent to 272.24 pesos. Rival  Salfacorp
SA  slid 2.7 percent to 1,280 pesos, ending a run of seven gains.  
 Metropolitan region home sales slid 24 percent in the first
half from a year earlier on tighter credit conditions and after
subsidies were reassigned following February’s earthquake, the
 Construction Chamber  said in a statement posted on its website.
