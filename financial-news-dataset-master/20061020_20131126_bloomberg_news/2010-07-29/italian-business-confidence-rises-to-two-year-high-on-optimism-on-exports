             Italian  business confidence  advanced
to a two-year high in July after the economy returned to growth
and exports benefited from the euro’s decline.  
 The Isae Institute’s manufacturing-sentiment index rose to
98.3, the highest since May 2008, from a revised 96.3 in June,
the Rome-based research center said today in an e-mailed
statement. The July reading was more than the median forecast of
96.4 in a Bloomberg News survey of 16 economists.  
 The European single currency has slid 9 percent this year,
making Fiat SpA cars and Luxottica Group SpA sunglasses cheaper
for U.S. consumers. Italian industrial production rose in May
and optimism among households grew for the first time in three
months in July as the economic outlook brightened.  
 “There was a clear improvement in demand,” Isae said in
the statement. A sub-index measuring expectations on orders rose
to 13 from 11 and another one measuring sentiment about the
economic situation rose to minus 11 from minus 13.  
 Luxottica  said this week net income climbed 30 percent in
the second quarter while Fiat reported its first profit in three
quarters in the period. Both companies said their earnings were
helped by a stronger U.S. dollar against the euro.  
 On July 15, the Bank of Italy raised its 2010 growth
forecast for Europe’s fourth-biggest economy to 1 percent from a
previous estimate of 0.7 percent, citing export gains. Still, it
may take time for the economy and business to recover. Italy’s
jobless rate climbed to a seven-year high of 8.4 percent in the
first quarter.  
 Isae conducted its survey of 4,000 companies between July 1
and July 19. Isae initially reported a reading of 96.1 in June.
