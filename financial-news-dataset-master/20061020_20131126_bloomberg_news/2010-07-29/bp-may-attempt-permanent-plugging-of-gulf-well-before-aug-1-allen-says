             BP Plc  may move up the schedule for
its effort to permanently plug the Gulf of Mexico well that
caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history, National Incident
Commander Thad Allen said.  
 The so-called static kill attempt, which would involve
pumping mud into the top of the well and perhaps sealing it with
cement, can begin before Aug. 1 if preparations advance
smoothly, Allen  said today at a press conference in New Orleans.  
 Since capping the well July 15, London-based BP has
 monitored  the well’s pressure and checked the seabed around it
for leaks that might erupt into another gusher. Government
scientists have reached a consensus that there are no leaks and
none will be triggered by the static kill, Allen said.  
 “Pressure has slowly risen, and it’s risen in a pattern
that’s consistent with a well with integrity,” Allen said. “We
feel it’s safe to go ahead.”  
 BP  rose  10.95 pence, or 2.7 percent, to 413.45 pence in
London trading. It has risen 30 percent this month after losing
almost half its value during the first nine weeks of the spill.  
 BP still needs to confirm the damaged well is plugged by
intercepting it from the bottom and inserting additional cement
as needed, Allen said. The company is preparing to insert a
final 2,000 feet (610 meters) of steel piping before the static
kill attempt can begin. Lines that will inject mud into the well
from the top also need to be connected securely, Allen said.  
 Louisiana Talks  
 Talks with officials in Louisiana, the state hardest hit by
the pollution, began today on how to redirect the response once
all threat of a further spill ends and no more oil can be
skimmed from the surface, Allen said.  
 According to the government, 360 miles (579 kilometers) of
Louisiana’s shores were polluted by oil as of yesterday, of the
total 625 miles of tarred coastline.  
 Louisiana’s parish presidents will be consulted on the use
of idled fishing boats for tasks such as oil monitoring and
recovery of boom laid to prevent oil from entering marshes and
bays, Allen said. They’ll also be consulted on when the cleanup
effort can stop, he said.  
 The disaster began April 20, when the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig, which BP leased from  Transocean Ltd. , exploded and
caught fire, causing it to sink and killing 11 workers. The well
gushed from 35,000 barrels to 60,000 barrels of oil a day, a
team of government and academic scientists estimated June 10.  
 Scientists expect to narrow the range of that estimate “in
a week or so” using data gleaned from the pressure readings of
the sealed well and collected during the static kill, Allen
said.
