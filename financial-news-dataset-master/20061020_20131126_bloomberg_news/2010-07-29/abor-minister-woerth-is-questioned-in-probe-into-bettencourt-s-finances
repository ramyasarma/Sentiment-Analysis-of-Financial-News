             French Labor Minister  Eric Woerth 
was questioned by authorities today for about six hours in an
investigation into the finances of  L’Oreal SA  heiress  Liliane Bettencourt , France’s richest woman.  
 Woerth spoke in his office in Paris as a witness to a
police unit specialized in financial crimes, said a spokeswoman
for the investigative magistrates leading the probe. She asked
not to be named under the judicial agency’s policy.  
 The preliminary probe is looking into potential tax fraud
and campaign finance-law violations after a former butler to
Bettencourt released secretly made tapes in which her financial
adviser refers to political gifts and overseas bank accounts.  
 Woerth “denied receiving any campaign financing except
that authorized by the law,” Jean-Yves Le Borgne, the
minister’s lawyer, told reporters today in Paris. Le Borgne said
the police questioning gave Woerth “the opportunity to put an
end” to “lies and fantasies” surrounding the case.  
 Until resigning last month, Woerth’s wife worked for the
company that manages Bettencourt’s fortune. Woerth quit this
month as treasurer of the Union for a Popular Movement, the
party of President  Nicolas Sarkozy .  
 Woerth, formerly budget minister with responsibility for
tax collection, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has said he
wanted to meet investigators to explain his side of the story.
