             Russian wheat exports may fall by
almost half in the current agricultural year because of a
drought and a local shortage of the grain, the Institute for
Agricultural Market Studies said.  
 Outbound shipments may decline to 9.5 million metric tons
from last year’s 18 million tons, Oleg Sukhanov, chief
specialist for grain markets at the Moscow-based  institute , also
known as IKAR, said by phone today.  
 “Russia won’t export wheat from state stockpiles, as
domestic flour millers and livestock farmers are facing a
shortage,” Sukhanov said. “Moreover, we don’t exclude Russia
imposing a restrictive grain export duty from 2011 to curb
exports by private producers.”  
 The national wheat harvest may fall 24 percent from the
prior year to as little as 47 million tons because of the
drought and lower yields, according to IKAR.
