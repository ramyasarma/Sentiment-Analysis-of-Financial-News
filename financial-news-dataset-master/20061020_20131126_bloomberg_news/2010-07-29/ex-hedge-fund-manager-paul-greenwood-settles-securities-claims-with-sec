             Paul Greenwood , the hedge fund
manager who pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiracy and
securities fraud, settled civil claims brought by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 Greenwood, the former general partner of WG Trading Co.,
agreed to refrain from violating securities laws and to pay yet-
to-be determined disgorgement and penalties, the SEC said in a
statement. U.S. District Judge  George B. Daniels  in Manhattan
entered the judgment against Greenwood today, the SEC said.  
 Greenwood and  Steven Walsh , his fellow manager of WG
Trading and WG Investors, were indicted last July on charges
that they conspired to defraud investors of $554 million. The
U.S. said the scheme stretched from 1996 until their arrest in
February 2009. A prosecutor said yesterday that Greenwood will
testify against Walsh at trial.  
 Fred Hafetz , Greenwood’s lawyer, said he had no comment on
the SEC settlement.  
 According to his plea agreement, Greenwood will have to
forfeit at least $331 million to the government, representing
the money he and Walsh obtained from their securities and wire
fraud. Greenwood also agreed to pay the U.S. an $83.5 million
judgment, the proceeds he “personally obtained” as a result of
the fraud.  
 The case is SEC v. WG Trading Investors, 09-1750, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
