             Nissan Motor Co. , Japan’s third-
largest automaker, swung to a first-quarter profit as auto
demand recovered in North America and sales grew in Asia.  
 Nissan posted net income of 106.6 billion yen ($1.22
billion) for the three months ended June 30, compared with a
16.5 billion yen loss a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based
company said in a statement. The results beat the 58 billion yen
average of three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg as
sales rose to 2.05 trillion yen from 1.5 trillion yen.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  expects Nissan’s
global sales to increase 8 percent this fiscal year, aided by 10
new models, including the Leaf electric car and the March
compact. The carmaker’s sales surged 68 percent in China during
the quarter compared with a year earlier, while government
subsidies boosted sales in Japan.  
 “In Japan and China, Nissan’s sales are growing very well
compared to Honda and Toyota,” said  Hiroaki Osakabe , a fund
manager at Tokyo-based Chiba-gin Asset Management Co.  
 Nissan plans to start selling its March car in China next
month and will raise annual production capacity in the nation
almost 70 percent to 900,000 units by 2012.  
 Sales in Asia excluding Japan rose 62 percent during the
quarter to 308,000 vehicles, while sales in its domestic market
grew 19 percent to 138,000. In the North America, sales gained
23 percent to 278,000 units.  
 “Challenging market conditions persist, but our performance
reflects strong demand for Nissan’s products,” Ghosn said in the
statement today.  
 Forecast Unchanged  
 Nissan reiterated its  forecast  for net income of 150
billion yen for the year ending March 31, compared to 42 billion
yen a year earlier.  
 Even as Nissan earned two-thirds of its full-year profit
forecast during the quarter, the company didn’t make a revision
because of uncertainty over the rest of the year, Corporate Vice
President  Joji Tagawa  told reporters in Yokohama today.  
 The automaker will decide whether it needs to change the
forecast in the second half, which starts on Oct. 1, he said.  
 Nissan will cut output in Japan by about 20 percent from
October compared with its September production plan because of
the yen’s strength and the expiration of government subsidies in
the nation, the company has said.  
 Sales in Japan may fall 20 to 30 percent when subsides
expire, as they did in Germany and France, Tagawa said today.  
 Honda Motor Co. reports first quarter earnings tomorrow,
while Toyota Motor Corp., Japan’s largest automaker, will
announce its results on Aug. 4.
