             Crime in South Africa is rated as
the biggest constraint to companies operating in the country,
followed by electricity supply and corruption, the World Bank
said.  
 Crime costs businesses on average 3.2 percent of sales, the
World Bank said in its Investment Climate report, published by
South Africa’s Trade Ministry today. Unit labor costs in South
Africa is higher than in peer countries, such as Brazil and
Thailand, undermining manufacturing exports, the report said.  
 The economy is characterized by “excessive concentration”
and a more “activist” competition policy is needed, the World
Bank said.
