             U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains after the government reported a bigger-than-estimated drop
in jobless claims.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September climbed 0.6 percent to 1,108.5 at 8:31 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 50 points, or
0.5 percent, to 10,498.  
 Initial jobless claims dropped by 11,000 in the week ended
July 24 from a revised 468,000, Labor Department figures showed
today in Washington. The number of people receiving unemployment
insurance rose, while those getting extended payments declined.  
 The S&P 500 dropped 0.7 percent yesterday after orders for
durable goods unexpectedly decreased and the Federal Reserve
said economic growth slowed in some areas. The gauge
has climbed 7.3 percent in July, headed for its best monthly
advance in a year, as more than 80 percent of its companies that
have reported so far posted second-quarter results that topped
analysts’ estimates.
