             Investors should buy the British
pound against the yen as the currency rallies after holding
above so-called support, Citigroup Inc. said, citing trading
patterns.  
 The pound on July 27 rose beyond resistance at 135.64 yen,
a trend line that connects the highs of June 3, July 14 and July
26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency also
held above support at 131.30 yen, a 76.4 percent retracement of
its fall from the April 26 high to the May 20 low, based on a
series of numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence.  
 The U.K. currency has “broken out of its recent
consolidation” against the yen, Citigroup analysts  Tom Fitzpatrick  in New York and  Shyam Devani  in London, wrote in a
research note yesterday. Sterling “targets 140-142” yen, they
wrote.  
 The pound traded at 135.99 yen as of 12:06 p.m. in Tokyo
from 136.44 yen yesterday in New York, when it climbed to 137.56
yen, its highest level since May 13. The British currency is
headed for its biggest monthly climb against the yen since
March, having risen 2.9 percent since June 30.  
 The U.S. bank recommends investors purchase the pound at
136.27 yen, with a target of between 141 and 142 yen and an
automatic instruction to sell the currency should it weaken
beyond 134.30 yen.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance or below support indicates a currency may
move to the next level. Resistance is an area where sell orders
may be clustered, and support is where buy orders may be placed.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
