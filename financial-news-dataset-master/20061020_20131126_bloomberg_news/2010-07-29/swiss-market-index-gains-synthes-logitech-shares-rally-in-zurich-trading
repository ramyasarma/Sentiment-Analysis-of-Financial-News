             Swiss stocks  climbed as Synthes
Inc., the world’s largest maker of bone-related medical devices,
reported higher earnings and Logitech International SA swung to
profit in the first quarter.  
 Synthes rallied 4.8 percent and Logitech, the world’s
biggest maker of computer mice, jumped 5.6 percent.  Clariant AG 
led declining shares as the world’s biggest maker of printing-
ink chemicals said raw material costs would rise as much as 10
percent this year.  
 The  Swiss Market Index  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies, gained 0.2 percent to 6,288.17 at 1:51 p.m. in
Zurich as 12 of the gauge’s 20 members advanced. The broader
 Swiss Performance Index  also rose 0.2 percent to 5,561.88.  
 Synthes  rallied 4.8 percent to 125.50 Swiss francs after
the company reported an 11 percent increase in first-half profit
to $424.6 million on cost control and sales growth in Europe.  
 Logitech  jumped 5.6 percent to 17.32 francs after posting
first-quarter net income of $19.5 million as global spending on
electronics increased. That beat the average analyst estimate of
$5.73 million in a Bloomberg survey and compares with a $37.4
million loss a year earlier.  
 Sales rose 47 percent to $479.3 million, exceeding the
company’s forecast. Analysts estimated revenue of $456.6
million.  
 Clariant Falls  
 Clariant  declined 3.4 percent to 13.91 francs. Chief
Executive Officer Hariolf Kottmann said in a conference call
that he expects raw material costs to increase 9 percent to 10
percent this year and reorganization costs to be close to 300
million francs ($290.7 million).  
 The shares fell even after the chemical maker raised its
margin target as job cuts and a shift in production to Asia
helped the company return to a second-quarter profit.  
 Bank Sarasin & Cie.  lost 6 percent to 39.95 francs after
the Swiss wealth manager controlled by Rabobank Groep NV said
first-half net income rose less than 1 percent to 51.2 million
francs as an inflow of client assets countered lower income from
trading. That missed the 70.3 million-franc median estimate of
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
