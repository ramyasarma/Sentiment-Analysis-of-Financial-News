             Bulgari SpA , the world’s third-
largest jeweler, reported second-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates on declining sales in Europe and confirmed
its full-year revenue forecast of at least 5 percent growth.  
 Net income was 600,000 euros ($780,000) compared with a
loss of 11.2 million euros a year earlier, the Rome-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement after markets
closed. The average  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was 7.7 million euros. Revenue increased 12 percent
to 244.2 million euros.  
 Bulgari, which is introducing more entry-priced jewelry
and high-end men’s watches, is taking longer than its peers to
recover from the recession as retailers continue to clear
inventories of old stock.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA ,
the world’s largest maker of luxury goods, said July 27 that
second-quarter sales at its watch and jewelry unit increased 24
percent.  
 “Bulgari embraced too many projects” before the economic
slowdown, HSBC analysts  Antoine Belge ,  Erwan Rambourg  and
 Sophie Dargnies  wrote in a note before the release of the
results. They have a “neutral” rating on the stock.  
 The first-half results are “in line” with Bulgari’s
forecasts, Chief Executive Officer  Francesco Trapani  said in
the statement. On the basis of July sales trends, Trapani
confirmed Bulgari’s full-year forecast for “mid-single-digit”
revenue growth, excluding currency swings.  
 Asia Sales  
 Second-quarter sales of jewelry, Bulgari’s largest product
category, increased 18 percent, while perfume and cosmetics
sales rose 7.6 percent. Sales of accessories jumped 28 percent
and watch sales dropped 1 percent.  
 Sales gained 65 percent in the Americas, 12 percent in
Japan and 23 percent in the rest of Asia, where the jeweler
said in March it will open seven directly operated stores this
year. Sales fell 2.5 percent in Europe and 11 percent in the
Middle East.  
 Bulgari will raise prices on all its products by about 3
percent on a full-year basis from April 1, Trapani said in
March. The increases should widen the gross margin to 63
percent in 2010, about the same as in 2008, he said at the
time.  
 Bulgari shares have risen 9.2 percent this year and closed
at 6.29 euros at 5:30 p.m. in Milan trading today, giving the
company a market value of 1.89 billion euros.
