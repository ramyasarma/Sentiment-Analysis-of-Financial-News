             Symetra Financial Corp . fell the
most since the initial public offering in January, after
reducing its forecast for full-year earnings.  
 Symetra fell 9.2 percent, or $1.12, to $11.03 at 4:02 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The forecast for
full-year adjusted operating income was cut to between $1.15 and
$1.30 a share from an April estimate of $1.40 to $1.55.  
 “Low interest rates continued to limit investment income
and constrain earnings,” Chief Executive Officer  Tom Marra  said
in the Bellevue, Washington-based company’s statement, which was
distributed by Business Wire.  
 Symetra’s second-quarter net income fell 24 percent to
$35.8 million, or 26 cents a share, from $47 million, or 42
cents, in the year-earlier quarter. The insurer reported $10
million in net realized investment losses, compared with a net
gain of $2.7 million in the year-earlier quarter.  
 Earnings per share missed by three cents the 33-cent
average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Symetra sold 30.4 million shares at $12 each in its January
initial public offering.
