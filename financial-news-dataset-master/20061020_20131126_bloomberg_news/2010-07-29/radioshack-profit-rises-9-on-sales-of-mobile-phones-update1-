             RadioShack Corp. , the consumer-
electronics retailer, said second-quarter profit increased
almost 9 percent, spurred by demand for mobile phones.  
 Net income advanced to $53 million, or 41 cents a share,
from $48.8 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier, Fort Worth,
Texas-based RadioShack said today in a statement. The earnings
per share were in line with the average of 16 analyst  estimates 
in a Bloomberg survey.  
 RadioShack, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
 Julian Day , spent more on marketing and boosted inventories of
mobile devices. U.S. stores’ wireless sales including Sprint
Nextel, T-Mobile and AT&T phones climbed 61 percent, blunting
declines for digital converter boxes, netbooks, cameras and
batteries.  
 Sales rose 4.7 percent to $1.01 billion, slightly less than
the average analysts’ projection of $1.02 billion.  RadioShack 
climbed 69 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $20.88 at 9:38 a.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have advanced
7.7 percent this year.  
 The company plans to expand a test selling wireless devices
in kiosks at Target Corp., the second-largest U.S. discount
retailer. Starting Aug. 15, it plans to set up Bullseye Mobile
kiosks in most Target stores by mid-2011. The Minneapolis-based
company operated 1,740 stores as of May 1.  
 Added Inventory  
 Inventory increased 12 percent to $646.2 million in the
quarter, while selling, general and administrative expenses
totaled $364.5 million, 8.6 percent higher than a year earlier.
The company cut its full-year forecast for capital expenditures
to $90 million to $110 million from as much as $120 million.  
 Three private equity firms have backed away from pursuing
RadioShack, three people with knowledge of the plans said last
week. TPG Capital plans to drop out of bidding for the retailer,
a person briefed on the talks said at the time. Blackstone Group
LP, which had weighed a joint offer with TPG, is not likely to
pursue RadioShack on its own, said another person.  
 Bain Capital LLC, which had separately expressed interest,
also has backed off, one person said last week. All three people
asked not to be identified because the bidding process is
private.
