             Mortgage rates  for U.S. loans set a
record low for the sixth straight week as investors sought the
relative safety of bonds backed by government-controlled home
finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  
 The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 4.54
percent in the week ended today from 4.56 percent last week,
McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac said. The average 15-year
rate was 4 percent, also a record in the data going back to
1971, the company said in a statement.  
 Falling rates have done little to boost demand that plunged
after a federal homebuyer tax credit of as much as $8,000
expired April 30. The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index of
home-loan applications fell 4.4 percent in the week ended July
23, approaching the 13-year low touched earlier this month, the
Washington-based group said.  
 Homebuilder sentiment in July fell to its lowest level
since April 2009, according to the  National Association of Home
Builders .  
 At the current 30-year rate, monthly payments for a
$100,000 loan would be about $509, down $43 from a year ago.
