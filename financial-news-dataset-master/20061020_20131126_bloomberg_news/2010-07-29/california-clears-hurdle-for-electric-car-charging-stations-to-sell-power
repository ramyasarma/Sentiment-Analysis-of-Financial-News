             California regulators voted to make
it easier for electric-car charging companies to sell power in
the U.S. state that’s likely to be the biggest market for such
vehicles.  
 Companies such as  Coulomb Technologies Inc. ,  Better Place 
and  Ecotality Inc.  can operate without being regulated as an
investor-owned utility, the California Public Utilities
Commission said today during its regular meeting in San
Francisco.  
 The decision removes a barrier on reselling electricity at
charging stations and may speed up the adoption of electric
cars, which will help the state meet greenhouse-gas reduction
targets, the commission said in a draft of its order.  
 California rules will force large automakers to offer
electric vehicles starting in 2011. General Motors Co., Nissan
Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and other automakers have said
California will be among the first markets for their lithium-ion
battery vehicles.
