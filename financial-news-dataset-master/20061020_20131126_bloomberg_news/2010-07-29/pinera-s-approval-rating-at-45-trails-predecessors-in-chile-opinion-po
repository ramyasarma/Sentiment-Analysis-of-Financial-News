             Chile’s  Sebastian Pinera  has the
lowest approval rating of any new president since the South
American country’s return to democracy two decades ago,
according to a research center’s poll announced today.  
 Forty-five percent of Chileans approve of Pinera, whose
term began in March, Santiago-based CEP said in its first poll
of the president, conducted June 17 to July 13. His predecessor
 Michelle Bachelet  had 46 percent approval in her first CEP
survey, while  Ricardo Lagos  had 49 percent,  Eduardo Frei  50
percent and  Patricio Aylwin  74 percent.  
 Pinera’s approval reflects perceptions that the president
lacks the charisma of Bachelet, said Mauricio Morales, a
political scientist at Santiago’s Universidad Diego Portales.
The polling results could encourage the opposition to step up
attacks on the government’s legislative proposals, he said.  
 “Today’s numbers definitely could complicate Pinera’s
agenda,” Morales said in a telephone interview today.  
 Pinera is considering strategies to raise as much as $1
billion in new mining taxes for earthquake reconstruction.
Congress rejected the government’s initial proposal on July 8.  
 The government also may submit a bill to congress that
would encourage local investors to repatriate resources held
abroad. The measure probably would include a reduced tax rate.  
 Pinera defeated Frei by 52 percent to 48 percent in a
runoff election in January.  
 CEP said its poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent.
