             The People’s Bank of China sold
three-year bills at an unchanged yield of 2.65 percent, having
dropped 3 basis points in the previous sale, according to
traders at BOC International (China) Ltd. and China Citic Bank
Corp.  
 The monetary authority offered 85 billion yuan ($12.5
billion) of the securities at the auction today.  
 The yield dropped at five sales previously since the
central bank resumed bi-weekly offerings of the securities April
8 to help drain cash from the financial system.
