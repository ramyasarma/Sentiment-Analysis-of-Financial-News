             Akamai Technologies Inc. , the
largest supplier of software to make online media load faster,
slumped 13 percent in Nasdaq trading a day after reporting its
profit margin narrowed.  
 The second-quarter  margin  before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization narrowed 2 percentage points from
a year earlier to 46 percent, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
Akamai said yesterday in a statement.  
 The company has worked to win customers from competitors
like  Level 3 Communications Inc.  and Limelight Networks Inc. by
cutting rates, according to  Dan Rayburn , an analyst at Frost &
Sullivan Inc. in New York. Since March, Akamai has handled at
least 51 percent of Netflix Inc.’s streaming video traffic,
partly on the “cost advantage” it offers, said  Steve Swasey , a
spokesman for the movie rental company.  
 Akamai fell $5.68 to $38.35 at 4:30 p.m. New York time on
the  Nasdaq  Stock Market, its largest drop since July 30, 2009.
The shares have gained 51 percent this year, the seventh- best
performing  stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  
 Second-quarter net income rose to $38.1 million, or 20
cents a share, from $36 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier.
Excluding some items, profit was 34 cents a share, matching the
average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales gained 20
percent to $245.3 million.  
 New President  
 This quarter , profit excluding some items will be 32 cents
to 34 cents a share, on revenue of $242 million to $252 million,
the company said yesterday on a conference call. Analysts
predicted profit of 34 cents a share and sales of $247.2
million.  
 Ebitda margins in the third quarter will be 45 percent to
46 percent, Chief Financial Officer  Donald Sherman  said on the
call.  
 “This is slightly below our long-term model, driven by the
investments we are making,” Sherman said.  
 Akamai named  David Kenny  as president, effective Sept. 7.
He will report to Chief Executive Officer  Paul Sagan , who has
also served as president since 1999.
