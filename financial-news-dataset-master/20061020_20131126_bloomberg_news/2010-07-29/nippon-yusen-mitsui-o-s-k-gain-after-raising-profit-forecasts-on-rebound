             Nippon Yusen K.K. , Japan’s largest
shipping line by sales, had its biggest gain in more than six
weeks in Tokyo trading after almost doubling its annual profit
forecast on a rebound in global shipping demand.  
 Net income will probably be 68 billion yen ($780 million)
in the year ending March 31, the Tokyo-based company said today
in a statement, compared with a previous forecast for 35 billion
yen. Nippon Yusen  climbed  5 percent to 358 yen at the end of
trading in Tokyo.  
 Nippon Yusen, expecting the first profit in three years at
its container division, has returned all laid up box ships to
service to meet U.S. demand for deliveries of car parts,
electronics and building materials. Steel and iron-ore price
gains may also help improve Chinese demand for bulk shipping,
analysts said.  
 “The rebound in container rates is helping shipping
lines,” said  Ryota Himeno , an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities Co. “We will probably see prices for bulk
shipping also increase later this year.”  
 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd.  and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd.,
Japan’s second and third-biggest shipping lines by sales, are
also predicting a return to profit this fiscal year for
container operations.  
 Mitsui O.S.K., operator of the world’s largest merchant
fleet, raised its full-year profit forecast by 8.3 percent to 65
billion yen. Shares of the Tokyo-based shipping line fell 0.5
percent to 602 yen.  
 Kawasaki Kisen boosted its forecast for full-year net
income 78 percent to 32 billion yen. The company’s shares
 advanced  2.7 percent to 378 yen.
