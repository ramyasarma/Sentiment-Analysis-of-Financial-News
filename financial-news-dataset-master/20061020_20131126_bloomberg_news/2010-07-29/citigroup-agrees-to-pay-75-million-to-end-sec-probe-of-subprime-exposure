             The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today accused Citigroup Inc. with misleading
investors about the company’s exposure to subprime mortgage-
related assets and also said Citigroup agreed to pay a $75
million penalty.  
 The SEC also accused one current and one former executive
for their roles in causing Citigroup to make the misleading
statements in an SEC filing. The information was in an e-mailed
statement.
