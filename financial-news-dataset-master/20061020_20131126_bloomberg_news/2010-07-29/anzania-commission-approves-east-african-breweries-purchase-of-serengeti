             Tanzania’s antitrust regulator
granted conditional approval of  Diageo Plc -owned East African
Breweries Ltd.’s acquisition of 51 percent of Serengeti
Breweries Ltd., Tanzania’s second-biggest beer maker.  
 East African Breweries, or  EABL , must sell its 20 percent
stake in rival  Tanzania Breweries Ltd.  before the purchase is
completed, the Fair Competition Commission said in a faxed
statement from Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital.  
 Diageo  owns  43 percent of EABL, which is Kenya’s second-
biggest company by market value, according to Bloomberg data.
EABL is targeting an initial market share of 30 percent upon
buying the Tanzanian business.  
 EABL must also continue to promote Seregenti’s corporate
identity for five years after the effective date of the merger
and not close any of Seregenti’s existing plants without prior
approval from the commission, it said.  
 “East Africa Breweries shall submit for the next five years
after effective date of the merger an annual progress report of
compliance with the investment strategy plan submitted during
the application of the merger and an annual progress report of
compliance with these conditions,” it said.  
 EABL welcomed the commission’s announcement and said it and
Serengeti were “fully committed to working with the FCC to
satisfy these conditions.”
