             Former Galleon Group LLC trader Zvi
Goffer, who is accused of conspiring in a vast insider-trading
case, was denied a bid to obtain documents and materials from
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to defend himself.
U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan today
rejected Goffer’s request.
