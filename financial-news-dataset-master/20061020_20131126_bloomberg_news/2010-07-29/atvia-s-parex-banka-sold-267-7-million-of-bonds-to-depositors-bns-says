             Parex Banka AS, the lender taken
over by the Latvian government in 2008, sold bonds worth 205
million euros ($267.7 million) to depositors facing withdrawal
restrictions, the  Baltic News Service  said.  
 The notes, which will mature in February 2012, will carry
an annual interest rate of 5 percent and will allow a retail
bank that will be split from Parex to operate without
restrictions, BNS said, citing Indra Zinkevica, a Parex
spokeswoman.  
 The government is splitting Parex into a retail bank and an
asset-management company. Restrictions on withdrawals were put
on large deposits at Parex after it was seized by the state
following a run on its deposits.
