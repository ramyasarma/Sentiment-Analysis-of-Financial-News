             Japanese horses were cleared for
travel to Australia in time for this year’s Spring Racing
Carnival, paving the way for their Melbourne Cup return after a
three-year absence.  
 Australia’s government last night approved two pre-export
quarantine facilities in Japan, Racing Victoria Ltd. said.
Japanese horses had been banned from traveling to Australia
since equine influenza outbreaks in both countries in 2007.  
 Stablemates Delta Blues and Pop Rock finished 1-2 in the
Melbourne Cup, the country’s richest race, when Japanese horses
last competed in Australia in 2006. That followed Eye Popper’s
runner-up finish in the Caulfield Cup a year earlier.  
 “The Japanese horses proved during the 2005 and 2006 Spring
Racing Carnivals that they are world-class performers,” Leigh
Jordon, Racing Victoria’s racing operations general manager,
said in a statement. “Their presence in the Melbourne Cup, and
any lead-up races for that matter, would add immense intrigue.”  
 Nominations for the A$6 million ($5.3 million) Melbourne
Cup, which takes place Nov. 2, close Aug. 3.
