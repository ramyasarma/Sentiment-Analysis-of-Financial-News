             Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA , Europe’s
biggest supplier of building materials, said first-half profit
rose almost fourfold as it cut costs and sales rebounded, led by
the U.S. and Asia.  
 Net income rose to 501 million euros ($655 million) from
128 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement. That compares with an average
 estimate  of 498 million euros in a Bloomberg survey of four
analysts.  
 The French supplier of glass, packaging and pipes raised
its full-year target for free  cash flow  to 1.4 billion euros, up
from a previous goal of at least 1 billion euros. It reiterated
its plan to reduce costs by 600 million euros in 2010 compared
with 2009, together with a full-year goal of “strong growth”
in operating income at constant exchange rates.  
 Operating income rose 55 percent in the first half to 1.45
billion euros. It will slightly increase in the second half from
the first half, the company said.  
 Revenue in the second quarter rose 8.6 percent to 10.8
billion euros, the company said. On a comparable basis, sales
rose 3.9 percent in the period.  
 Saint-Gobain plans to spend at least 200 million euros on
“small” acquisitions in emerging markets in the second half,
Chief Executive Officer  Pierre -Andre de Chalendar said on a
conference call. The purchases will focus on the energy-
efficiency and solar-energy industries, he said.  
 The company is “getting closer to the moment when
conditions are met” for selling its packaging unit, Chalendar
said, declining to elaborate. The unit’s second-quarter revenue
rose 3.2 percent to 973 million euros.
