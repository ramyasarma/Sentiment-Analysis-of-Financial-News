             U.K. Employment Minister  Ed Davey 
said he plans to scrap rules that allow employers to force
workers to retire at 65, an effort to extend working lives in
the nation’s aging labor force.  
 The government outlined a proposal today to scrap the
Default Retirement Age starting in October 2011 today and said
it would seek views from employers and unions on how to change
the rules. Employer groups said the plans would limit their
ability to get rid of  workers they no longer need . They said the
government should lift the retirement age rather than scrap it.  
 “With more and more people wanting to extend their working
lives we should not stop them just because they have reached a
particular age,” Davey said in a statement in London. “We are
committed to ensuring employers are given help and support in
adapting to the change in regulations.”  
 The government wants workers to remain active for longer as
it seeks to take pressure off the pensions system. About 12
percent of workers remained employed after reaching retirement
age this year compared with 7.5 percent in the 1990s.  
 With  national debt  forecast to increase to about 70 percent
of gross domestic product by 2014, the government is seeking to
impose the biggest cuts to spending since World War II. Welfare
has been targeted as one of the main areas for savings.
