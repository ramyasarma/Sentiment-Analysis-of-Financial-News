             Software AG , Germany’s second-
largest software maker, said second-quarter profit climbed 29
percent driven by sales growth at its business integration
software unit Webmethods, which it bought in 2007.  
 Net income rose to 37.4 million euros ($48.7 million) from
28.9 million euros a year earlier, the Darmstadt, Germany-based
company said in a statement today, beating the 34.8 million-euro
average estimate of seven  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. The
company raised its full-year outlook.  
 Software AG, which specializes in streamlining business
processes and software consulting services after buying IDS
Scheer AG last year, said sales advanced 52 percent to 267.3
million euros from 176.4 million euros. Analysts had estimated
revenue at 263.8 million euros. Software AG’s customers include
 Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.,   Apple Inc.,  and the European Central
Bank.  
 “With Webmethods we have a new, profitable growth driver
that will propel the company into a new dimension,” Chief
Executive Officer  Karl-Heinz Streibich  said in the statement.
“The integration of IDS Scheer AG will strengthen our growth
trend and dynamic results even further in the future.”  
 Companies are resuming spending on applications after the
global economic slump, benefitting Software AG and IDS Scheer.
IDS Scheer customizes software bought from companies including
 SAP AG , the world’s largest maker of business management
software.  SAP  said July 27 said sales of software and related
services rose 16 percent in the second quarter.  
 Outlook  
 For the full year, Software AG now predicts that net income
will rise between 10 percent and 12 percent from 140.8 million
euros in 2009. Its previous forecast was for net income to grow
8 percent to 12 percent.  
 Total revenue is still expected to climb 25 percent to 30
percent from 847.4 million euros, and product revenue will
advance between 12 percent and 15 percent from 580.5 million
euros, both at constant currency rates, the company forecast.  
 Software AG  shares  fell 1.9 percent to 91.8 euros in
Frankfurt trading yesterday, for a gain this year of 20 percent.
