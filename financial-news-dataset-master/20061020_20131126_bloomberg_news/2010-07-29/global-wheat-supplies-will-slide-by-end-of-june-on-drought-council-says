             World wheat stockpiles will decline
by the end of June as drought damages crops in Russia and
Kazakhstan, the  International Grains Council  said, slashing an
outlook for higher inventories.  
 Stocks will drop to 192 million metric tons at the end of
the 2010-11 crop year from 197 million tons at last month’s
close, the London-based council said in a monthly report today.
The group cut its outlook for this year’s wheat harvest.  
 Russia may harvest 45 million tons of wheat this year, the
Russian Grain Union said this week, down from 62 million tons
last year. The drought in the country has damaged 10.1 million
hectares (25 million acres), or 32 percent of all planted areas,
Agriculture Minister Yelena Skrynnik said July 23.  
 “A prolonged period of dry weather and high temperatures
significantly reduced yield prospects in Russia, Kazakhstan,
parts of Ukraine and northwestern areas of the EU,” the council
said, referring to the European Union.  
 The group last month had forecast an increase in global
wheat stocks to 201 million tons.  
 The world wheat harvest will be 13 million tons smaller
than forecast last month at 651 million tons in 2010-11, the
council said. Wheat consumption will amount to 655 million tons,
according to the report.  
 Kazakh Crop  
 Russia will harvest 50 million tons of wheat in 2010, 7
million tons less than forecast in June, while Kazakhstan’s crop
will be 13.5 million tons, a downward adjustment of 3 million
tons, according to the council.  
 The U.S. is forecast to export 26 million tons of wheat in
2010-11, more than a previous forecast of 24.1 million tons and
compared with year-earlier exports of 23 million tons, the
council said.  
 “This month’s sharply lower crop expectations in
Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine are reflected in reduced export
forecasts, offset by a major increase in U.S. exports, in
particular,” the grains council said.  
 Russia’s outbound shipments will decline to 15.3 million
tons from 18.3 million tons a year earlier, the group estimates.
Last month, the grains council had expected Russian wheat
exports of 18 million tons.  
 World corn production probably will be 823 million tons in
2010-11, 1 million tons less than forecast last month though
still a record, on bigger crops in the U.S., China and Mexico,
the council said. Use of the grain will rise to 830 million
tons, unchanged from last month’s estimate, on demand from the
bio-ethanol industry in the U.S., it said.
