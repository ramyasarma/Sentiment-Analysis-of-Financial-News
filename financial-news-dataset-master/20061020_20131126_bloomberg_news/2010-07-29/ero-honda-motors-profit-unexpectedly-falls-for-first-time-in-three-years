             Hero Honda Motors Ltd. , India’s
biggest motorcycle maker, reported its first quarterly decline
in profit in almost three years as higher raw material costs
eroded gains from selling more two-wheelers.  
 Net income  in the quarter ended June 30 fell 1.7 percent to
4.92 billion rupees ($106 million), or 24.62 rupees a share,
compared with 5 billion rupees, or 25.04 rupees, a year earlier,
the company said in a statement today. That was lower than the
5.8 billion-rupee  average profit estimate  in a Bloomberg survey
of 26 analysts. Sales grew 12 percent to 42.6 billion rupees.  
 Hero Honda’s spending on raw materials like steel and
rubber rose to 72 percent of its sales in the quarter from 68
percent a year ago, Chief Financial Officer  Ravi Sud  said.  Hot-
rolled steel coil , a benchmark product used in cars and
buildings, jumped 17 percent in the quarter to 610 euros ($795)
a metric ton, the highest since 2008, according to data compiled
by Metal Bulletin.  
 “High metal prices have put margins under pressure in the
quarter,” said  Vijay Sarthy , a Chennai, south India-based
analyst at Spark Capital Advisors Pvt. “I expect the second
quarter to be better as commodity prices are now softening.”  
 Hero Honda,  26 percent  owned by Japan’s  Honda Motor Co. ,
the world’s largest motorcycle maker,  gained  1 percent to
1,874.3 rupees in Mumbai trading today. The earnings were
announced after trading hours.  
 Hero Honda’s sales of  Splendor and CBZ  models rose 10
percent to a record 1.2 million in the three-month period, the
company said in the statement. The company’s  profit margin 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization was 14
percent in the quarter, lower than 17 percent a year earlier,
Sud said.  
 The New Delhi-based company plans to build a fourth factory
to add to its 5 million-vehicle production capacity as demand
rises in the world’s second-largest market for motorcycles and
scooters.
