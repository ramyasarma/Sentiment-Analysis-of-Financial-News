             Intel Corp. , the world’s biggest
chipmaker, said a special master appointed to review an
antitrust lawsuit brought by computer users recommended
rejecting their request for class-action status.  
 The recommendation will become the court’s ruling unless
the plaintiffs object within 21 days, Intel spokesman  Chuck Mulloy  said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 The purchasers of computers with Intel microprocessors
“have not established that they will be able to demonstrate an
antitrust violation through common proof,” Special Master
 Vincent J. Poppiti  wrote in a report yesterday to U.S. District
Court in Wilmington, Delaware.  
 Santa Clara, California-based Intel said July 13 it logged
record sales for the quarter, beating analysts’ estimates, with
more than $11 billion in sales.  
 The consolidated lawsuit “generally accuses Intel of
wrongfully offering discounts to computer manufacturers,”
allegedly inflating prices, according to Mulloy.  
 Intel fell 30 cents to $21.03 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading in New York at 4:30 p.m.  
 The lead case is Paul v. Intel Corp., 05CV485, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
