             Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. Chief
Executive Officer Sean Boyd said he expects gold to be trading
at about $1,260 by the end of this year.  
 “I wouldn’t write gold off yet,” Boyd said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television. “We’ll retest all-time
highs later in the year.”  
 The price of gold has fallen 7.6 percent from its record
high of $1,266.50 in New York in June. The metal should reach
its strongest level in September and October this year, Boyd
said.
