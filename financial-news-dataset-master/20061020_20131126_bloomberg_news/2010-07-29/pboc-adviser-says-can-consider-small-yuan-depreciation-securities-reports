             Chinese central bank adviser Zhou
Qiren said the nation can consider a small yuan depreciation to
help stabilize export growth, the China Securities Journal
reported today.  
 The central bank has already indicated that there won’t be
one-time adjustments in the value of the yuan, showing that
adjustments of the exchange rate will be long-term and have
fluctuations, Zhou was cited as saying.

                          July 30 (Bloomberg) -- Nigel Chalk, the International Monetary Fund's mission chief to China, talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li about the outlook for the country's currency and central bank monetary policy. 
     People’s Bank of China officials said "that with a benign inflation outlook there was less need for higher nominal interest rates at this point," the IMF said in a statement yesterday after annual consultations with the Chinese government.
