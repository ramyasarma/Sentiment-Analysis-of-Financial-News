             Motorola Inc. , the U.S. mobile-phone
maker, reported second-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
estimates, helped by demand for its new line of smartphones.  
 Profit, excluding some costs, was 9 cents a share, the
company said today in a statement. Analysts had projected 8
cents, according to the average of estimates compiled by
 Bloomberg . Revenue for the quarter was $5.41 billion, compared
with the $5.2 billion estimate.  
 Motorola’s Droid X, the company’s latest phone based on
Google Inc.’s Android software, sold out at Verizon Wireless and
Best Buy Co. stores after its debut this month. Such demand,
following the success of the original Droid released late last
year, bodes well for a recovery at Motorola, which suffered a 27
percent sales drop in 2009, said  Mark McKechnie , an analyst at
Gleacher & Co. Securities.  
 “The Droid X appears to be off to a good start, fueling
confidence in Motorola’s handset turnaround,” said McKechnie,
who is based in San Francisco and has a “buy” rating on the
stock.  
 Revenue for the quarter fell 1.5 percent from the year-
earlier period. Net income climbed to $162 million, or 7 cents a
share, from $26 million, or 1 cent, a year earlier.  
 Motorola , based in Schaumburg, Illinois, rose 22 cents, or
2.9 percent, to $7.90 at 10:09 a.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock had slid 1 percent this year before today.  
 Smartphone Surge  
 Sanjay Jha , co-chief executive officer who oversees the
handset business, reiterated today on a conference call that
he’s “confident” the unit will turn a profit in the fourth
quarter. That would pave the way for a planned spinoff of the
phone unit and the division that makes cable TV set-top boxes,
which the company said it expects in the first quarter.  
 The mobile-phone unit reported an operating loss, excluding
income from a legal settlement, of $109 million, compared with
an operating loss of $239 million in the year-earlier quarter.
Revenue dropped 6 percent to $1.72 billion.  
 Motorola said it shipped 2.7 million smartphones last
quarter and 8.3 million handsets in total. McKechnie had
estimated 2.5 million smartphones and 8.3 million handsets.  
 The Droid X is “off to a great start” and is “exceeding
our expectations,” Jha said. He expects the company to launch
“meaningfully more” than 20 smartphones this year, after
saying in the past the company would debut “at least 20.”  
 Financial Outlook  
 Demand for the Droid X is currently outstripping supply, he
said. Jha, who joined Motorola in 2008 from chipmaker  Qualcomm
Inc. , said today a shortage of mobile phone chips is “our
largest constraint.” He expects Motorola to ship 12 million to
14 million smartphones this year and said shipments would be a
“modest” amount more than that if not for supply constraints.  
 Motorola agreed this month to sell its wireless networks
unit to Nokia Siemens Networks for $1.2 billion, leaving co-CEO
 Greg Brown  to manage just the enterprise mobility business that
makes two-way radios and bar-code scanners.  
 The  enterprise mobility division  had a revenue gain of 10
percent to $1.85 billion in the second quarter. Sales at the
set-top-box unit fell 13 percent to $886 million, and sales at
the wireless networks unit dropped 2 percent to $967 million.  
 Motorola said overall profit for the third quarter,
excluding certain items, will be 10 to 12 cents a share. That
compares with the average estimate of 10 cents per share,
according to Bloomberg’s survey of analysts.  
 “The old Droid is still selling surprisingly well, the
Droid X is doing well and it looks like the Droid 2 launch is
early,” said MKM Partners analyst  Tero Kuittinen  who is based
in Greenwich, Connecticut and has a “neutral” rating on the
stock. “This is kind of like Motorola’s moment in the sun.”
