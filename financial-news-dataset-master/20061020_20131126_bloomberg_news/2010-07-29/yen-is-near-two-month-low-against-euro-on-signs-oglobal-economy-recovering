             The yen traded near a two-month low
against the euro as signs Europe’s economic recovery remains
resilient damped demand for Japan’s currency as a refuge.  
 The yen headed for a monthly loss against 13 of its 16
major counterparts after European confidence in the economic
outlook rose to the highest level in more than two years and
before a report forecast to show inflation quickened in the euro
region. The dollar was near the lowest since May against the
euro on concern a government report today will show the U.S.
economic recovery is slowing.  
 “People are beginning to realize Europe isn’t as bad as
they had expected,” said  Makoto Noji , a senior market analyst
at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Cross currencies may climb
slowly against the yen.”  
 The yen was at 113.36 per euro as of 8:01 a.m. in Tokyo
from 113.51 in New York yesterday, after reaching 114.74 on July
28, the weakest since May 18. The yen traded at 86.69 per dollar
from 86.79. The dollar was at $1.3076 per euro from $1.3079,
after touching $1.3107 yesterday, the lowest since May 4.  
 The yen is headed for a 4.6 percent drop against the euro
and a 2 percent gain against the dollar this month. The dollar
has dropped 6.4 percent against the euro since June 30.  
 An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the euro
nations increased this month to 101.3, the highest level since
March 2008, the European Commission said yesterday.  
 Europe CPI  
 Consumer prices in the 16-member euro region rose 1.7
percent in July from a year ago after increasing 1.4 percent in
June, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before the European Union statistics
office in Luxembourg reports the data today.  
 The dollar headed for a 1.3 percent drop this week against
the euro before reports today that economists said will show the
U.S. economy and business activity expanded at a slower pace.  
 “The U.S. continues to see negative economic data,” said
 Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency dealer at Okasan Securities
Co. in Japan. “The dollar is locked under downward pressure.”  
 The U.S. economy grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the
second quarter after expanding at a 2.7 percent pace in the
first quarter, according to the median estimate of economists in
a Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce Department reports
the data today. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc.
is forecast to report its business barometer fell to 56.0 in
July from 59.1 in June, according to another Bloomberg survey.  
 Demand for the yen may also fall before a report forecast
to show Japan’s industrial production grew at the slowest pace
in more than a year last quarter, adding pressure on the
government to boost consumer incentives as export growth cools.  
 Factory output rose 0.2 percent in June from May, according
to the median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News before Trade Ministry reports the data at 8:50 a.m. today
in Tokyo. That would cap the smallest quarterly gain since
production fell in the first three months of 2009.
