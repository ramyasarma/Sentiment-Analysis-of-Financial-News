             NTT DoCoMo Inc. , Japan’s largest
mobile-phone operator, reported a 3.5 percent drop in first-
quarter profit as revenue from data services failed to offset a
decline in voice-call traffic.  
 Net income  fell to 142.15 billion yen ($1.63 billion) in
the three months ending June 30, from 147.4 billion yen a year
earlier, the Tokyo-based carrier said in a statement to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange today. The company kept its full-year
earnings outlook unchanged.  
 DoCoMo and rivals  KDDI Corp. , Japan’s second-largest
carrier, and  Softbank Corp.  are expanding their smartphone
lines with models running  Google Inc. ’s Android software to
bolster demand for data communications and offset falling
revenue from voice services. DoCoMo President  Ryuji Yamada  aims
to attract users by being the first Japanese carrier to offer
faster, more efficient Long Term Evolution, or LTE, wireless
technology.  
 Operating profit , or sales minus the cost of goods sold
and administrative expenses, dropped 4.5 percent to 240.5
billion yen in the quarter as revenue rose 0.4 percent to 1.09
trillion yen, DoCoMo said. The figures compare with a 226.7
billion yen average of three  analyst  operating profit estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The analysts projected sales at 1.06
trillion yen.  
 Android  
 DoCoMo started selling its second Android model in April,
while Softbank,  Apple Inc. ’s exclusive provider of the iPhone
in Japan, offers one Android model. KDDI introduced its first
handset running the software developed by Google in June.  
 DoCoMo added 432,300 net new mobile-phone users in the
quarter ended June 30, falling short of the 695,600 for
Softbank, according to separate filings by the carriers. KDDI
trailed with 219,100 new subscribers.  
 Net income  will climb 0.4 percent to 497 billion yen in
the 12 months ending March 2011, while revenue declines 1.5
percent to 4.22 trillion yen, DoCoMo forecast in April.
Operating profit will probably rise 0.7 percent to 840 billion
yen, it said at the time.  
 DoCoMo  fell 0.4 percent to close at 138,200 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange before earnings were reported. The stock
has added 6.6 percent this year, after declining 27 percent in
2009.
