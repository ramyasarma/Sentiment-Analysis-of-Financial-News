             Natura Cosmeticos SA  and Lojas
Renner SA led a rally for retailers on speculation consumer
demand will keep profits growing without spurring inflation.  
 Lojas Renner, the clothing retailer that is scheduled to
report second-quarter results today, jumped 3.8 percent to 54.48
reais.  Natura Cosmeticos SA , Brazil’s biggest cosmetics maker
that said July 22 profit jumped 14 percent, surged 4.4 percent
to 44.57 reais.  
 Brazil’s central bank said today in minutes from its July
20-21 meeting that economic growth may have slowed to
sustainable levels since the start of the year, helping to
contain inflation risks.  
 “We have some good results to come, and what’s come out
has been good, too,” said  Joao Pedro Brugger , who helps oversee
70 million reais ($39.8 million) at Leme Investimentos in
Florianopolis, Brazil. “The central bank seems more relaxed and
the economy should stay heated for a good while longer.”  
 A slowing Chinese economy and doubts about the strength of
the U.S. recovery are helping to fight inflation that’s been
above the government’s 4.5 percent target since January, the
bank said today in the minutes of its July 20-21 meeting.  
 A drop in the inflation rate and evidence Latin America’s
biggest economy is slowing prompted the central bank to reduce
the pace of interest rate increases last week. Policy makers
increased the Selic rate by 50 basis points to 10.75 percent,
surprising 48 of 51 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg who expected
a third straight 75 basis-point increase.
