             Mitsubishi Logistics Corp. is poised
to begin a tender offer for a stake of more than 50 percent in
Fuji Logistics Co. in a transaction that may total 10 billion
yen ($115 million), Nikkei English News reported, without citing
anyone.  
 Fuji Electric Holdings Co., which owns 27.4 percent of Fuji
Logistics, and Toyota Industries Corp., which has 26 percent,
will back the proposal, Nikkei said.
