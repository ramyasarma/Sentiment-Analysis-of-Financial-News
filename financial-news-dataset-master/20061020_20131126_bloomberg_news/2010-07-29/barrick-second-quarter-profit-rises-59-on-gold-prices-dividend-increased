             Barrick Gold Corp. , the world’s
largest producer of the metal, said second-quarter profit
increased 59 percent and raised its dividend as prices climbed
to a record.  
 Net income  rose to $783 million, or 79 cents a share, from
$492 million, or 56 cents, a year earlier, Toronto-based Barrick
said today in a statement. Profit excluding one-time items was
77 cents a share, topping the 72-cent  average estimate  of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales gained 34 percent to $2.64
billion.  
 “Barrick has become the most consistent earnings and cash-
flow generator in the senior gold sector,”  Greg Barnes , a
Toronto-based analyst at TD Newcrest Securities, said in a note
to clients. “This is the  fifth straight quarter  that Barrick
has beaten consensus.”  
 Chief Executive Officer Aaron Regent reiterated plans to
boost the company’s gold output this year to as much as 8
million ounces, from  7.4 million last year , helped by new
production from the Cortez Hills project in Nevada. The company
also raised its dividend 20 percent to 12 cents on a quarterly
basis and said future dividends will be quarterly instead of
semi-annual.  
 Gold, which climbed to a record $1,266.50 an ounce on June
21 in New York trading, has since fallen about 7.5 percent.  
 ‘Positive’ Outlook  
 The outlook for the metal remains “positive,” even as
investor concerns about Europe’s sovereign-debt problems have
eased, Barrick Chief Financial Officer  Jamie Sokalsky  said on a
conference call with investors.  
 “Sovereign-debt issues around the world aren’t likely to
go away in the foreseeable future,” Sokalsky said. “The main
drivers of investment demand, and hence, higher gold prices are
still in place.”  
 Gold reached all-time highs in euros, U.K. pounds and Swiss
francs last month on demand for a haven from Europe’s fiscal
woes.  
 Barrick  rose  39 cents, or 0.9 percent, to C$42.01 at 4:15
a.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading.  The shares  have risen
1.3 percent this year.
