             Indonesia’s rupiah rose to a three-
year high as the country’s improving economy and relatively high
interest rates attract funds from abroad. Bonds gained.  
 The Jakarta Composite  Index  climbed to a record high after
overseas investors pumped $414 million into local stocks this
month through yesterday, lifting net purchases for the year to
$1.27 billion. The government predicts the economy will expand 6
percent in the second half of 2010, after growth of 5.8 percent
in the six months through June, and economists surveyed by
Bloomberg estimate  inflation  reached a one-year high of 5.8
percent in July.  
 “Foreign investors are very positive toward Indonesia and
they like the medium- to long-term growth story,” said Brian
Jackson, a Hong Kong-based senior emerging-markets strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada. “Inflation is picking up and we expect
the central bank to raise rates by 50 basis points in the second
half. The higher yield should further support the rupiah.”  
 The rupiah rose 0.3 percent to 8,973 per dollar as of 4:24
p.m. in Jakarta, the strongest level since July 2007, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has appreciated 4.7
percent this year, after strengthening 16 percent in 2009.
Jackson said he expects the exchange rate to reach 8,800 by the
end of this year.  
 Bank Indonesia in July left its benchmark interest rate at a
record-low 6.5 percent for an 11th straight month. The central
bank will raise the rate to 7 percent by year-end, according to
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Benchmark rates in the U.S., the euro region and Japan are no
more than 1 percent.  
 Bonds Rise  
 Government bonds rose, pushing the yield on the benchmark
10-year note down six basis points to a one-month low of 8.07
percent, according to midday prices at the Inter-Dealer Market
Association. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Indonesia’s local-currency notes have returned 15 percent
this year, the biggest gain among 10 Asian local-currency debt
indexes compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc. Foreigners’ holdings of
the securities rose 57 percent this year through July 27 to a
record 169.7 trillion rupiah ($18.9 billion), according to the
finance ministry’s website.
