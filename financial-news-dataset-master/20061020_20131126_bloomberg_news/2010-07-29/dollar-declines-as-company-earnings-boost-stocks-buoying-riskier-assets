             The euro climbed to $1.31 for the
first time in almost three months as European confidence in the
economic outlook rose to the highest level in more than two
years this month and German unemployment decreased.  
 The Swiss franc advanced to a six-month high against the
dollar on speculation the central bank was selling some of its
$208 billion in reserves, which almost tripled during the past
year as the national bank tried to weaken the currency.  
 “We’re in a bearish dollar supply mode and bullish for the
euro,” said  Win Thin , a senior currency strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York. “The optimism is there.
People are buying the euro on dips.”  
 The euro appreciated 0.6 percent to $1.3078 at 4:01 p.m. in
New York, from $1.2995 yesterday, after reaching $1.3107, the
highest level since May 4. The euro traded at 113.63 yen,
compared with 113.66. The yen strengthened 0.8 percent to 86.82
against the dollar, from 87.47.  
 Europe’s shared currency was headed for a 7 percent monthly
rally against the dollar and a 5.3 percent gain versus the yen
on the region’s economic prospects.  
 An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the euro
nations increased this month to 101.3, the highest level since
March 2008, the European Commission said. The number of people
out of work in Germany fell in July for a 13th month, dropping
by a seasonally adjusted 20,000 to 3.21 million, the lowest
level since November 2008, the Federal Labor Agency reported.  
 Stress Tests  
 The euro was also supported this week as stress tests
released July 23 found only seven European banks needed to raise
additional capital.  
 The Federal Reserve underscored yesterday in the Beige Book
business survey its view that the U.S. economic recovery, while
still moving forward, is progressing at a slower pace than
earlier in the year.  
 U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 2.5 percent
annualized rate in the second quarter after expanding at a 2.7
percent pace in the first three months of the year, according to
the median forecast of 81 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
The report from the Commerce Department is due tomorrow.  
 “There’s a good chance we’re going to see continued
strength in the euro-zone data and continued weakness in U.S.
data,” said  Kathy Lien , director of currency research at the
online trader GFT Forex, in New York. “The rallies are
cautious. We’re not seeing really aggressive moves across the
board.”  
 Outlook for Euro  
 The euro’s 10 percent rally from a four-year low of $1.1877
reached June 7 will probably stall as economic weakness in
Europe outside Germany saps demand for the 16-nation currency,
according to  Rebecca Patterson  of JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 The shared currency may peak after reaching at least
$1.3125, the next level of technical resistance, said Patterson,
global head of foreign exchange at the private banking unit of
JPMorgan in New York, in a radio interview today on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  
 “Germany is the only element of strength here,” Patterson
said. “It’s Germany versus the rest of Europe. And I think with
that backdrop, it’s hard to see all of this continuing very
far.” Resistance is a level where sell orders may be clustered.  
 The Swiss franc climbed against all of its most-traded
counterparts on speculation the central bank is selling
reserves.  
 The currency appreciated as much as 1.9 percent to 1.0374
versus the dollar, the strongest level since Jan. 25. The franc
gained as much as 1.1 percent to 1.3582 against the euro.
Standard Bank Plc advised buying the franc against the dollar,
predicting a rally to 1.0150.  
 Weaker Kiwi  
 New Zealand’s dollar fell for a third day versus the
greenback after the central bank said deteriorating growth will
slow the pace of future interest-rate increases.  
 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor  Alan Bollard  raised
the official cash rate for a second month, increasing it by a
quarter-percentage point to 3 percent.  
 New Zealand’s dollar dropped 0.4 percent to 72.41 U.S.
cents, from 72.73. It slid 1.1 percent to 62.90 yen, from 63.60.
