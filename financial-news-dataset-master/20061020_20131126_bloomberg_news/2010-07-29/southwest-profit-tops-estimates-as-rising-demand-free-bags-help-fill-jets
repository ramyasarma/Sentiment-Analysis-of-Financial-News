             Southwest Airlines Co.’s plan to
keep its fleet size little changed through 2012 marks a record
stretch without expansion as the carrier waits for business
travel to pick up, Chief Executive Officer  Gary Kelly  said.  
 New jets will be added only to replace older aircraft being
retired, with 10  Boeing Co.  737-700s arriving this year and 14
in 2011, Kelly, 55, said today in an interview. The Dallas-based
company had 544 planes as of the end of June.  
 Business travel, prized in the industry because of last-
minute ticket sales at higher prices, isn’t bouncing back as
quickly as leisure, Kelly said by telephone. Last year marked
the first time the world’s biggest discount carrier didn’t
expand capacity since it began flying in 1971.  
 “We’ll be looking for opportunities to grow, and we’re
still a growth company; it’s just that right now we don’t see
the wisdom to be doing that,” Kelly said.  
 Seating capacity will remain little changed for each of the
next two years, with any increase coming through more efficient
 management  of the existing fleet such as additional night or
weekend flights, Kelly said.  
 Southwest flies to 69 U.S. destinations and plans to add
service to Charleston and Greenville, South Carolina, next year.
No further additions are planned right now, Kelly said.  
 Options Exercised  
 The airline said today it was exercising options to buy 25
737s, valued at $1.7 billion based on list prices. Deliveries
start in 2011. Some of the plane purchases planned for 2011 and
2012 include options converted into firm orders.  
 In 2009, Southwest made its first companywide voluntary
buyout offer to trim costs. Along with a 5 percent reduction in
capacity, that marked the end of a growth era for the company,
whose burgeoning fleet and annual profits dating to 1973 set it
apart from a U.S. industry ravaged by job cuts and bankruptcies.  
 U.S. airlines have parked more than 500 jets and eliminated
more than 10,000 jobs since 2008 in response to higher fuel
costs and plunging revenue in the recession.  
 Delta Air Lines Inc. , the world’s largest carrier, said
last week it would park 20 more jets next year. The Atlanta-
based company has said it plans to spend $1 billion to upgrade
its current fleet with more lie-flat seats and winglets rather
than purchase new planes.  
 American, United  
 AMR Corp. ’s American Airlines last week agreed to purchase
35 more Boeing 737s, and  UAL Corp. ’s United Airlines last year
announced plans to buy 50 widebody jets, split between Boeing
787s and  Airbus SAS  A350s.  
 Southwest was unchanged at $12.01 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The  shares  have advanced 5.1
percent this year.  
 Southwest today reported a second-quarter profit that rose
more than threefold, beating analysts’ estimates, as its policy
of not charging for  checked bags  helped fill planes.  
 Earnings excluding some items climbed to $216 million, or
29 cents a share, compared with $59 million, or 8 cents, a year
earlier, the airline said today in a statement. That beat the
average 27-cent analysts’  estimate  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales 
advanced 21 percent to $3.17 billion.  
 The nine largest U.S.  carriers  had a combined 4.5 percent
increase in traffic for June, the best result since December
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Southwest is the
country’s fifth-biggest.  
 Domestic Yields  
 Domestic yields, a measure of fares and travel, have risen
each month this year after falling every month in 2009,
according to the  Air Transport Association . Yields for June were
15.27 cents per mile flown, less than the 16.02 cents for the
same month of 2008, reflecting lower fares.  
 Southwest is the only major U.S. carrier that allows
passengers to check two bags at no charge, a policy it says has
helped woo travelers from rivals. The company’s planes flew at
record capacity for 11 consecutive months until June.  
 The airline was founded in 1967 by former Chairman  Herb Kelleher  and his business partner Rollin King, who drew up the
carrier’s original network -- a triangle between Dallas, Houston
and San Antonio -- on a cocktail napkin. They had to battle
competitors in Texas courts for the right to start flights,
which began in 1971.
