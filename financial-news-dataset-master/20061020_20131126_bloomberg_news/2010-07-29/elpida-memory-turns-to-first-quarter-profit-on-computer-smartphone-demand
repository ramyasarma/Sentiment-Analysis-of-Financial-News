             Elpida Memory Inc. , Japan’s sole
maker of computer-memory chips, swung to a first-quarter profit
on demand from computers, smartphones and digital televisions.  
 Net income for the three months ended June 30 was 30.7
billion yen ($352 million), compared with a 44.4 billion yen
loss a year earlier, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement
today. The  average  of five analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was for a profit of 28.1 billion yen.  
 Elpida and bigger rival  Samsung Electronics Co. , Asia’s
biggest maker of semiconductors, are benefiting from a revival
in demand for chips used in personal computers. Global sales of
chips that temporarily store data will climb 40 percent to $31.9
billion this year, researcher ISuppli Corp. said in February.
Elpida said today chip prices were “generally at high levels.”  
 The price of the  benchmark 1-gigabit DRAM chip  has fallen
about 20 percent since Samsung said May 17 it would spend $9.2
billion expanding production capacity for DRAM and other chips
this year, raising concern that supply of the components, which
trade like commodities, may exceed demand.  
 Sales more than doubled to 176.3 billion yen from a year
earlier, while operating profit was at 44.4 billion yen,
compared with a 42.3 billion yen loss a year earlier, the
company said.  
 Prices of Elpida chips rose 78 percent in the quarter from
a year earlier, and gained 9 percent from the previous three
months, the company said.  
 Elpida  rose 1.2 percent to close at 1,359 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange prior to the announcement. The benchmark
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average  dropped 0.6 percent. Shares of the
chipmaker have risen 9.8 percent this year.
