             BASF SE , the world’s biggest
chemical company, reported second-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates after a recovery in demand and higher prices
for products spanning plastics and catalysts.  
 Net income rose to 1.18 billion euros ($1.5 billion)
compared with 343 million euros a year earlier, the
Ludwigshafen-based company said in a statement today. Analysts
in a Bloomberg survey predicted 1.07 billion euros.  
 BASF said the strength of the rebound in demand helped it
surpass expectations. The maker of pesticides and polymers
reiterated sales growth this year will outperform the pace set
by the wider chemical industry and that earnings will increase
“considerably.”  
 Sales advanced to 16.2 billion euros from 12.5 billion
euros.  
 BASF expects to earn a premium on its cost of capital, a
prerequisite set by Chief Executive Officer  Juergen Hambrecht  to
ensure maintaining or boosting shareholder dividends.
