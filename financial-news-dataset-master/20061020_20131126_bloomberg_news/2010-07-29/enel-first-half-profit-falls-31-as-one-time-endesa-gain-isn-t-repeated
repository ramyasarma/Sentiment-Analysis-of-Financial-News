             Enel SpA , Italy’s largest utility,
posted a 31 percent decline in first-half profit as a gain
linked to the purchase of a stake in Spanish power company
Endesa SA wasn’t repeated.  
 Net income fell to 2.43 billion euros ($3.18 billion) from
3.52 billion euros a year earlier, beating the 2.1 billion-euro
 mean estimate of 11 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. Excluding
onetime items profit rose 11 percent, according to a statement
distributed by the Italian exchange.  
 Revenue rose to 34.8 billion euros as sales increased in
Latin America and Spain. Net financial debt rose to 53.89
billion euros from 50.87 at the end of 2009 mainly because of
the effects of euro depreciation versus dollar and Latin America
currencies.  
 The company expects to cut debt by year end selling assets
and because of a positive cash-flow. Enel said in May it plans
to reduce debt to 45 billion euros in 2010 by selling 7 billion
euros of assets, including a stake of its Enel Green Power unit
in an initial public offering, which will take place in October.  
 “The market focus is likely to be on the company’s effort
to reduce the debt to its target,” Unicredit analyst  Javier Suarez  wrote in a note to clients last week before results were
released. Unicredit has an “hold” rating on the stock.  
 “We expect to beat the full year target for earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization,” Chief
Executive Officer  Fulvio Conti  said in the statement. The
utility said in March that this year’s ebitda will be 16 billion
euros ($20 billion), unchanged from a year earlier.
