             The People’s Bank of China sold
three-month bills at a yield of 1.5704 percent in open-market
operations, unchanged for the fifth straight sale, according to
traders at BOC International (China) Ltd. and China Citic Bank
Corp.  
 The monetary authority, which offered 22 billion yuan ($3.2
billion) of the 91-day notes, has let the yield rise at five
previous auctions this year. The rate last climbed four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.5704 percent on June 10.
