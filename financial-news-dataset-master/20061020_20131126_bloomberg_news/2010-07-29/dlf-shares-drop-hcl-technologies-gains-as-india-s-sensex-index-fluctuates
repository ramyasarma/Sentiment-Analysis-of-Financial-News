             India’s stocks rose. Bank of Baroda
and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd. advanced after
reporting quarterly earnings.  
 State-owned  Bank of Baroda  gained after its first-quarter
net income climbed 25 percent. Tata Teleservices, a mobile phone
operator, surged the most in six weeks after reporting its first
quarterly profit on record.  DLF Ltd.  declined after its earnings
fell short of analysts’ estimates.  
 “Companies reporting good numbers are being rewarded,”
said  Kaushik Dani , a Mumbai-based fund manager with Peerless
Mutual Fund, which manages $322 million in assets. “Those
missing estimates or giving poor guidance were not preferred by
investors.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 34.63, or 0.2 percent, to 17,992.00, after swinging
between gains and losses at least 16 times. The gauge has
climbed 12 percent from this year’s most recent low on May 25.  
 The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange rose
0.2 percent to 5,408.90. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.2 percent
to 2,292.61. The gauges may have been more volatile today as
futures contracts rolled over from July to August.  
 Bank of Baroda rose 2.5 percent to 734.2 rupees, its
biggest gain in a month. The lender reported a 25 percent
increase in quarterly profit to 8.59 billion rupees ($184
million). Separately, the company said it plans to raise 20
billion rupees selling debt and shares.  
 Tata Teleservices  
 Tata Teleservices  soared 6.8 percent to 22.8 rupees, its
steepest climb since June 16., after posting first-quarter net
income of 5.58 billion rupees. The stock dropped 36 percent in
the past year.  
 DLF lost 0.9 percent to 309.1 rupees. DLF reported first-
quarter profit of 4.11 billion rupees ($88 million), below the
4.55 billion rupee average estimate of 19 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Shares  of DLF have declined 14 percent this
year.  
 Reliance Industries Ltd. , India’s most valuable company,
lost 1.1 percent to 1,010.15 rupees after being cut to “equal-
weight” from “overweight” by  Vinay Jaising  and  Rakesh Sethia ,
analysts at Morgan Stanley, who cited a slowdown in the ramp up
of gas production. It was downgraded to “add” from “buy” by
 Bhaskar Chakraborty , an analyst at IIFL Ltd.  
 HCL Technologies  
 HCL Technologies Ltd. , a software maker, advanced 1.5
percent to 378.05 rupees after reporting fourth-quarter net
income of 2.38 billion rupees. The company returned to profit a
year earlier after a quarterly loss in 2008.  
 Dabur India Ltd. , a maker of products ranging from shampoos
to beverages, lost 1.7 percent to 196.45 rupees after being cut
to “add” from “buy” by  Arnab Mitra , an analyst at IIFL Ltd.,
who said gains may be limited in the next 12 months.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  815 million rupees  ($17.4
million) of Indian equities on July 27, raising total
investments in stocks this year to 426 billion rupees, according
to the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Shoppers Stop Ltd.  (SHOP IN) rose 2.5 percent to 625.85
rupees. India’s second-largest publicly traded retailer’s first-
