             Roy Oswalt  joined the Philadelphia
Phillies from the Houston Astros, the second straight season the
defending National League champions have acquired an All-Star
pitcher near the trade deadline from a struggling team.  
 The deal was announced by the Astros in a statement on
their  website .  
 To get Oswalt, a three-time All-Star pick, the Phillies
gave up their best young starter,  J.A. Happ , and two prospects.  
 Oswalt, a 32-year-old right-hander, waived his no-trade
clause and left the team he helped reach the World Series in
2005. He had asked to be traded in May, with the Astros in last
place. They now are fifth in the National League Central.  
 The Phillies, World Series champions two years ago and NL
title holders last season, are in second place in the East, 3½
games behind Atlanta. A year ago, they got  Cliff Lee , the
reigning American League Cy Young Award winner, in a deadline
deal from the Cleveland Indians, who finished tied with Kansas
City for last place in the AL Central.  
 Oswalt has a 3.42 earned run average and was 6-12 with the
Astros, who currently sit 17 games under .500. He has a career
record of 143-82 with an ERA of 3.24 in his 10th season.  
 He went 20-12 with a 2.94 ERA five years ago as the Astros
won the NL pennant before being swept by the Chicago White Sox
in the World Series.  
 Happ, a 27-year-old left-hander, has battled a forearm
strain and been limited to three starts this season, his second
full year in the major leagues. He has a career ERA of 3.11 and
a 14-5 record over parts of four seasons.
