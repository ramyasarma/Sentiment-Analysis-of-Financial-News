             China’s  sovereign wealth fund  posted
an 11.7 percent return on its overseas portfolio in 2009,
reversing a loss a year earlier, according to the official China
Central Television.  
 Net income almost doubled to $41.7 billion, CCTV reported
today, citing China Investment Corp.’s 2009 annual report. Total
return on equity, including gains from the overseas portfolio
and holdings in local banks, was 12.9 percent, compared to 6.8
percent in 2008, according to CCTV.  
 The fund spent $58 billion in global investments last year,
more than double the combined amount for the previous two years,
CCTV said. Investments in 2009 ranged from U.S. power producer
 AES Corp.  to Indonesia’s  PT Bumi Resources.  Beijing-based CIC is
asking the Chinese government for more funds to invest,
Executive Vice President  Jesse Wang  said last month.  
 “The CIC’s focus on resources should have contributed to
strong performances in 2009,” said  Rachel Ziemba , London-based
senior analyst at Roubini Global Economics, before the
announcement. As many sovereign wealth funds have seen an
increase in assets with a global market rally, “it would be
shocking if CIC had not had strong returns,” she said. “But
the truth will come in 2010 and beyond given the risks to the
risky assets that dominate CIC’s portfolio.”  
 Temasek Holdings Pte , Singapore’s state investment firm,
this month said assets climbed 43 percent to S$186 billion ($135
billion) in the year to March 31.  
 Volatile Economy  
 CIC had 24.68 percent of its global portfolio in public
equity markets, Wang said at the Asia Banking and Finance
Conference last month. The sovereign wealth fund holds about 18
percent of its investments in fixed-income securities and 8.8
percent in inflation-linked products, he said at the time.
Almost 7 percent is held in private-equity funds.  
 “CIC should fare well in 2010 as they have renewed
confidence, a more experienced organization, and clear
strategy,” said  Victoria Barbary , senior analyst at Monitor
Group in London. “But the global economy is quite volatile so
there are far more external forces that have to be understood
and responded to.”  
 The  MSCI World Index , which surged 27 percent in 2009, has
dropped 3.3 percent this year as the European debt crisis and
China’s efforts to curb asset bubbles threatened the global
recovery.  Bumi Resources , Indonesia’s biggest coal producer in
which CIC made its largest investment announced in 2009, has
fallen nearly 30 percent.  
 Natural Resources  
 CIC in May agreed to invest C$817 million ($790 million) in
a new oil-sands venture with Canada’s  Penn West Energy Trust ,
gaining a stake in the world’s largest crude deposits outside
Saudi Arabia. The company bought stakes worth about 650 million
euros ($845 million) in Apax Partners LLP’s private-equity fund
from investors, a person familiar with the transaction said in
February.  
 “Our preliminary data for the first half of 2010 suggests
that CIC is continuing to pursue its strategy of investing in
natural resources and sharing risk through partnerships and
managed funds, as well as some exposure to private equity,”
Barbary said. “Again their strategy seems to be reasonable
returns, with a risk profile that limits the downside, and
protects against dollar-based inflation/devaluation.”
