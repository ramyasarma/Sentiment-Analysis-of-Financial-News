             Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. ,
the world’s largest fertilizer producer by market value,
reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as
demand rose for its namesake crop nutrient.  
 Profit excluding receipt of a special dividend was $1.38 a
share, topping the $1.21  average estimate  of 26 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Net income  more than doubled to $472
million, or $1.55 a share, from $186.2 million, or 61 cents, the
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based company said today in a statement.
Sales rose 68 percent to $1.44 billion.  
 Demand for potash, a form of potassium used to boost crop
yields, is rising as farmers recharge their fields with
nutrients after deferring purchases in 2008 and 2009 amid record
high fertilizer prices and the global economic slump.  
 “Farmers are eager to capture the economic benefits of
their efforts and are making the necessary investment to protect
the fertility of their soil,” Chief Executive Officer  Bill Doyle  said today on a conference call with investors and
analysts.  
 The company, which also makes phosphate and nitrogen-based
crop nutrients, raised its full-year  profit forecast  to $5 to
$5.50 a share, from $4.50 to $5.25 previously.  
 The midpoint of the new forecast still is lower than the
$5.17 estimated on average by 26 analysts after subtracting the
17-cent special dividend, which was received from Israel
Chemicals Ltd., said  Edlain Rodriguez , a New York-based analyst
with Gleacher & Co.  
 Consensus Estimates  
 “They did better in the second quarter than expected, but
consensus estimates will have to come down,” Rodriguez, who
recommends buying the shares, said in a telephone interview.  
 Potash Corp.  rose  C$4.69, or 4.6 percent, to C$106.39 at
4:19 p.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading.  The shares  have
declined 7 percent this year.  
 Sales volumes of potash rose to 1.9 million tons from
394,000 tons while the company sold the nutrient for an average
of $309 a ton, about 35 percent less than a year earlier.  
 Global potash shipments probably will rise to about 50
million tons this year and 55 million tons in 2011, the company
said. On July 22, competitor Mosaic Co. forecast 46 million to
48 million tons, up from about 32 million in 2009.  
 “Fertilizer buyers have re-engaged and consumption in most
major potash markets -- the primary exception being China -- is
forecast to return to levels near those prior to the global
economic downturn,” the company said.  
 Potash consumption in China may rise 29 percent next year
to 11 million metric tons, Doyle said.  
 Canpotex Inc., the offshore potash marketing arm of Potash
Corp.,  Agrium Inc.  and Mosaic Co., will likely sign a new potash
supply contract with China by the end of the year, Doyle said.
