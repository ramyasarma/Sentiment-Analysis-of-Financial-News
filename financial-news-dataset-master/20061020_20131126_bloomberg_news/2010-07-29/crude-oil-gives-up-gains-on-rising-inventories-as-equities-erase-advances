             Crude oil dropped for a third day in
New York on speculation the economic recovery is not proceeding
fast enough to rein in excessive fuel supplies.  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’  oil
output increased for the third time in four months in July, led
by gains in Iraq, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Futures
yesterday declined to a one-week low after U.S. crude imports
jumped to the highest level in almost four years, leading to an
unexpected increase in commercially held  inventories .  
 “There’s a fear of a slowdown in economic growth which
will go on for the next few weeks,” said  Gerrit Zambo , a trader
at Bayerische Landesbank in Munich. “Investors are likely to be
disappointed with the economic data and oil will come down a
bit. It’s more likely to go below $70 than above $80.”  
 Crude for September delivery declined as much as 54 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $76.45 a barrel, in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, and traded for $76.54 as of 1:36
p.m. London time. Yesterday, it fell to $76.99, the lowest
settlement since July 21. Brent crude for September settlement
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange was down 45
cents at $75.61.  
 Futures yesterday declined to a one-week low after U.S.
crude imports jumped to the highest level in almost four years,
leading to an unexpected increase in commercially held
 inventories .  
 The Energy Department report showed  crude supplies  climbed
7.31 million barrels to 360.8 million in the week ended July 23,
the biggest increase since March 19.  
 “A lot of the crude build is due to imports, and implied
demand for products like gasoline and distillates has increased,
offsetting some of the bearishness,” said  Mark Keenan , chief
investment officer at fund manager Cubit Asset Management Pte in
Singapore.  
 OPEC production rose by 80,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent, to
an average 29.24 million barrels a day from a revised 29.16
million in June, according to Bloomberg’s survey. Output by
members with quotas gained 30,000 barrels to 26.825 million from
a revised 26.795 million. The figure was 1.98 million above
their target.
