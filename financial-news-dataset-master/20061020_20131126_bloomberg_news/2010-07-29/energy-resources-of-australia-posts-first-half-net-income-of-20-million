             Energy Resources of Australia Ltd. ,
the uranium producer controlled by Rio Tinto Group, declined the
most in almost three months after reporting a 37 percent drop in
first-half sales of the fuel for nuclear power stations.  
 Energy Resources , the operator of the Ranger mine in
Australia’s Northern Territory, fell as much as 6.3 percent to
A$13.44 in Sydney, the biggest drop since May 3. The shares
traded 4.5 percent lower at A$13.70 at 1:57 p.m. local time,
while the benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index  dropped 0.7 percent.  
 Uranium supply may outpace demand during the next 18 months
to two years due to increased production, especially in
Kazakhstan, and more of the material being released by the U.S.
Department of Energy, Chief Executive Officer  Rob Atkinson  said
in telephone interview today from Darwin.  
 “I think the uranium market is fairly well-serviced” over
that period, Atkinson said. After that, “there is going to be a
realization that Kazakhstan is supplying an enormous proportion
of the world market, and I don’t think countries or buyers are
going to be comfortable having as many eggs in one basket.”  
 Sales fell to A$217.7 million ($196 million) in the first
half from A$347 million a year earlier on lower output and
prices, the company said in a statement today to the Australian
stock exchange. Net income dropped 82 percent to A$22.7 million,
the producer of about a 10th of the world’s mined uranium said.  
 Energy Resources cut its 2010 uranium output forecast by as
much as 18 percent because of delayed access to higher grades of
ore. It expects production for the year of 4,300 to 4,700 tons,
the company reiterated today.  
 Previous Forecast  
 Previously it had forecast output to be “broadly similar”
to the 2009 level of 5,240 tons. The average uranium price it
receives this year is expected to be similar to prices in 2009,
the company said.  
 Sales declined in the first half because of weaker
production and prices and a stronger Australian dollar, Energy
Resources said. Uranium oxide production in the first half of
the year slumped 36 percent from a year earlier, and the average
price it received declined to $44.79 from $48.02 a year earlier.  
 Over the “long term,” prices of uranium should rise with
higher demand, mainly in China, Energy Resources said.  
 Royal Bank of Scotland earlier this month cut its rating on
Energy Resources stock to “sell” from “hold,” citing project
uncertainty and a “lousy” uranium market. “We see little
investor appetite,” for Energy Resources, RBS analysts
led by  Lyndon Fagan  said in the July 14 research note.
