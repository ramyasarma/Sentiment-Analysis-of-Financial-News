             ConocoPhillips, the third-largest
U.S. oil company, and Murphy Oil Corp. plan to sell refineries
in Europe or convert them into terminals as profits shrink and
demand wanes for fuels such as gasoline.  
 The latest announcements bring the number of plants in
Europe to at least 12 that are for sale, been idled, or will be
converted into terminals, with a total capacity of 1.85 million
barrels of oil a day. That compares with 11 in the Americas,
with a combined daily oil-processing capacity of 1.23 million
barrels.  
 ConocoPhillips  shelved plans to upgrade its 260,000 barrel-
a-day Wilhelmshaven plant in Germany, forcing it to write off
about $1 billion in its second-quarter earnings, the Houston-
based company said in a July 22 statement.  
 ConocoPhillips and Murphy Oil join refiners including Royal
Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, and Petroplus Holdings AG in closing
or converting plants, particularly in Europe, as they seek to
reduce overcapacity amid falling demand for oil-products.  
 Murphy Oil  plans to exit refining to focus on its upstream
and retail businesses, the Arkansas-based company said on July
22. The newly-upgraded 130,000 barrel-a-day Milford Haven plant
in Wales, the 125,000 barrel-a-day Meraux facility in Louisiana
and the 35,000 barrel-a-day Superior site in Wisconsin will be
put up for sale, it said.  
 Refining margins, or the profit from turning crude oil into
fuels, in northwest Europe fell to an estimated average of $2.55
a barrel this quarter to July 22, according to  data  by BP Plc.
That compares with $3.84 in the second quarter and $2.60 in the
third quarter of last year.  
 ConocoPhillips bought the German plant from Louis Dreyfus
Energy Holdings Ltd. in 2005 for an undisclosed price. Murphy
Oil paid $250 million in 2007 for Total’s 70 percent stake in
the Welsh refinery.  
 The following table lists refineries around the world that
have shut, are slated for permanent closure or conversion, and
units idled for economic reasons. Capacity is in thousands of
barrels of oil a day.
