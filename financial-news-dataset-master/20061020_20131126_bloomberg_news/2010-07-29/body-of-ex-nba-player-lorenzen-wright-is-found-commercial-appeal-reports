             The body of former National
Basketball Association player  Lorenzen Wright  was found in a
wooded area in southeast Memphis, Tennessee, the Commercial
Appeal  reported , citing a law enforcement official it didn’t
identify.  
 The 34-year-old Wright had been missing since July 19, the
day he had planned to return to Atlanta after visiting his six
children in Memphis, the newspaper said. A Memphis homicide
detective last night declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News, saying he wasn’t authorized to speak and the
investigation was incomplete.  
 A police dispatcher in Germantown, Memphis, received a 911
call on Wright’s cell phone on the day he disappeared, the
Commercial Appeal said. He heard several gunshots before the
call ended and no one answered a returned call, the paper added.  
 Wright spent  13 seasons  in the NBA after being drafted as
the overall seventh pick by the Los Angeles Clippers in 1996. He
also had stints with Atlanta, Memphis, Sacramento and Cleveland,
averaging eight points and 6.4 rebounds in 778 career games.
