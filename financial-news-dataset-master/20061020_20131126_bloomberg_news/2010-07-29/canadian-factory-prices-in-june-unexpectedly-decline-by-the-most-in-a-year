             Canadian factory product prices
dropped by the most in more than a year in June, faster than a
decline in their raw-material costs, government figures showed.  
 The  industrial product price index  fell 0.9 percent in June
from May, the most since May 2009, Ottawa-based Statistics
Canada said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
13 economists was for a rise of 0.2 percent. Primary metal
prices fell 2.9 percent and petroleum and coal prices fell 2.3
percent.  
 The  raw-materials price  index fell 0.3 percent as non-
ferrous metals such as zinc fell 6.7 percent, Statistics Canada
said. The index was expected to rise 1 percent, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists.  
 The figures suggest that factory profit margins narrowed in
June. Factory sales have increased in eight of nine months
through May, Statistics Canada said July 15. Sales have regained
less than half of the decline from a  recession  that ended last
year.  
 For the 12 months ending in June, industrial prices rose
0.2 percent, the second such increase after more than a year of
declines, the report said. The raw materials index fell 0.1
percent over that time, the first drop after seven prior gains.  
 The agency revised its estimate of May’s raw-materials
price decrease to 7.3 percent from the originally reported 7.2
percent. The estimate for May’s industrial product price index
gain was increased to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent.
