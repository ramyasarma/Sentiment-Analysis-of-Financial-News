             Hog futures rose to the highest
price in almost three weeks on signs that U.S. supplies of bacon
are trailing consumer demand. Cattle declined.  
 Wholesale  pork bellies , used to make bacon, jumped 7.9
percent yesterday to $1.3321 a pound, the highest price since at
least January 1998, U.S. data show.  Stockpiles  monitored by the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell to 14.109 million pounds last
week, down 70 percent from 2009. Bacon demand tends to peak in
the Midwest in August, when tomatoes are ready for harvest and
more people eat bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches.  
 “The bacon market will probably lead pork products higher
for the next several weeks,” said  Paul Beere , a market adviser
at Prime Agricultural Services in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Low
supplies are “due to herd liquidation” and a rebound in
demand, he said.  
 Hog futures for October settlement rose 1.125 cents, or 1.5
percent, to close at 78.075 cents a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, after touching 78.4 cents, the
highest level for a most-active contract since July 9.  
 Hog futures have jumped 47 percent in the past year as pork
supplies declined and demand recovered from the recession and
the H1N1 virus, known as swine flu.  
 U.S. retail bacon prices climbed to $4.046 a pound in June,
the highest level since at least 1980, according to the most
recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.  
 Pork-belly futures for August delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$1.035 a pound, after yesterday jumping the CME’s 3-cent limit.  
 Cattle Market  
 Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.725 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 93.475 cents a pound. The price has climbed 3.8
percent this month. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement
dropped 0.5 percent to $1.14275 a pound.  
 Cattle fell as declines in the stock market fueled
speculation that beef demand will shrink as the economy slumps,
said  Troy Vetterkind , the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage
in Chicago. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped as much as
1.2 percent, before paring the loss to trade little changed.
Wholesale  choice-beef  prices fell 0.6 percent at midday to
$1.5378 a pound.  
 “Cattle broke because the stock market broke, and the cash
trade is coming in a little lower and boxed beef was a little
lower,” Vetterkind said.
