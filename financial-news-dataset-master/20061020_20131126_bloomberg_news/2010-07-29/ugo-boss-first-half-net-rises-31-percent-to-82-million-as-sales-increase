             Hugo Boss AG , Germany’s largest
clothing maker, said first-half profit rose 31 percent on higher
own-store sales and rising demand for suits in Asia and the
Americas.  
 Net income advanced to 62.6 million euros ($81.6 million),
or 91 cents per preferred share, compared with 47.7 million
euros, or 70 cents, a year earlier, the Metzingen, Germany-based
clothier said in a statement today.  
 Boss, which added 26 new stores in the period, now operates
458 mono-brand outlets. Sales from these directly operated
stores, which are more profitable than wholesale, advanced 10
percent. Boss’s sales rose at a “double-digit” percent pace in
Asia and the Americas. Overall revenue fell 2 percent to 769
million euros.  
 “We expect further sales growth,”  Christoph Schlienkamp ,
an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe in Dusseldorf, wrote in a note
before the figures were released, adding that sales will benefit
from accumulated demand in Asia and other emerging regions. He
recommends investors sell the stock.  
 Demand for luxury goods is returning as Chinese shoppers
buy more high-end clothing and accessories and retailers
replenish inventories after the recession.  
 Boss now forecasts that sales will rise as much as 5
percent on a currency-neutral basis this year after earlier
calling for a “single-digit” percentage advance. Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will rise
as much as 12 percent this year, Boss said.  
 Boss is controlled by London-based buyout firm Permira
Advisers.  
 The preferred shares fell 1 percent to 35.45 euros at 9:15
a.m. in Frankfurt trading, giving the company a market value of
2.3 billion euros.
