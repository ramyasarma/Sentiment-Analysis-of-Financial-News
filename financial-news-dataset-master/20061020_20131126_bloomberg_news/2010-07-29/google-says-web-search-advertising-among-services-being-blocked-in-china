             Google Inc.  said some services,
including Internet search, mobile and advertising, are being
fully blocked in China, raising concern that the government may
still be dissatisfied with how the company provides information.  
 At least two other services, including news and images,
were being partially blocked, Google said today on its  website .
Web search, images, news and ads had been fully or mostly
accessible in the previous days. The Gmail e-mail service
remains fully or mostly accessible.  
 Google had its license renewed earlier this month after it
stopped automatically sending Chinese users to its separate  Hong
Kong  site. A conflict with China erupted in January after the
company said it would no longer self-censor search results to
comply with government rules.  
 Jill Hazelbaker , a spokeswoman for Mountain View,
California-based Google, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment.  
 Google fell as much as 2.3 percent to $473.75 in  extended
trading . The stock had gained 64 cents to $484.99 during regular
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have fallen 22
percent this year.
