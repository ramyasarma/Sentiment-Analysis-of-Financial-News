             Canadian stocks  fell, paring a
monthly gain, after Canada and the U.S. reported smaller
increases in economic growth than economists had forecast.  
 Toronto-Dominion Bank, the country’s second-largest bank,
lost 1.1 percent as  lenders retreated  for the first time in
seven days. BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. gained 2.6
percent after two people familiar with the company’s plans said
it will market a rival to Apple Inc.’s iPad in November.
Canadian Oil Sands Trust, the largest owner of the Syncrude
project, dropped 2.2 percent after cutting its 2010 production
forecast.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  fell 15.21
points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,713.43. The S&P/TSX gained 3.7
percent this month as commodities rallied in response to
stronger-than-forecast corporate earnings worldwide. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price Index advanced  6.1 percent 
this month, with copper surging 12 percent, the most in a year.  
 “How self-sustaining is this economy? That’s what people
are questioning,” said  Bob Decker , who helps oversee C$4.2
billion ($4.07 billion) as a money manager at Aurion Capital
Management in Toronto. “No one disputes we’ve got a recovery in
earnings. It’s the sustainability of the recovery that’s being
questioned.”  
 Canadian gross domestic product increased 0.1 percent in
May, Statistics Canada said. Economists in a  Bloomberg survey 
had estimated that economic growth climbed 0.2 percent, based on
the median estimate in a Bloomberg Survey.  
 U.S. Growth  
 U.S. GDP advanced at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in
the second quarter, the Commerce Department said in Washington,
trailing the median economist estimate of 2.6 percent. The rate
of increase in consumer spending eased from the first quarter.  
 The  S&P/TSX Energy Index  retreated for a fourth day, due
largely to Canadian Oil Sands, which had its 12-month unit-price
estimate cut to C$31 from C$34.50 by TD analyst  Jeff Meunier .  
 Canadian Oil Sands dropped 2.2 percent to C$26.96. Nexen
Inc., an oil and gas producer with operations on five
continents, declined 1.2 percent to C$21.35. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-largest energy company by market
value, lost 1.1 percent to C$35.40.  
 Five of the six largest publicly traded  Canadian banks 
declined. TD decreased 1.1 percent to C$73.16. Royal Bank of
Canada, the country’s largest bank, slipped 0.6 percent to
C$53.72. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the No. 5 bank by
assets, retreated 0.6 percent to C$70.60.  
 RIM Rises  
 RIM rose for a third day, gaining 2.6 percent to C$59.15
after Bloomberg News reported it will introduce a “Blackpad”
tablet. The company’s worldwide smartphone shipments increased
the most among the top five handset makers in the second
quarter, researcher Strategy Analytics said today.  
 First Quantum Minerals Ltd., the second-largest Canada-
based copper producer, sank 4.5 percent to C$64.42, adding to
yesterday’s 4.7 percent slump. A parliamentary committee in
Zambia has called for the reintroduction of a windfall tax on
copper sales above $2.50 a pound, UBS AG analyst  Onno Rutten 
said in a note to clients.  
 Viterra Inc., Canada’s largest grain handler, fell 4.2
percent to C$8.05 after competitor GrainCorp Ltd. agreed to buy
AWB Ltd. for A$803 million ($723 million). The purchase may help
GrainCorp challenge Viterra and Cargill Inc. for market share in
Asia.  
 Earnings  
 Companies such as MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.
and Domtar Corp. continued to rally after reporting financial
results.  Fourteen of 25  S&P/TSX companies that have reported
quarterly profit over the past two days have beaten the average
analyst estimate.  
 Aerospace and defense contractor MacDonald, Dettwiler
increased 6.7 percent to a two-year high of C$48. The company,
which also provides real-estate data, reported second-quarter
revenue of C$258.4 million, topping the average of seven analyst
estimates by 3.5 percent.  
 Domtar, North America’s largest maker of paper for copiers
and envelopes, surged 8.5 percent to C$60.24 after its second-
quarter profit beat the average of 16  analyst forecasts  by 65
percent, excluding certain items. The company’s adjusted net
income of $116 million was the most in a quarter since at least
2006.  
 Sierra Wireless Inc., a telecommunications equipment maker,
surpassed the average profit forecast of 14 analysts by  79
percent , excluding certain items. Shares jumped 23 percent, the
most in four years, to C$9.65.
