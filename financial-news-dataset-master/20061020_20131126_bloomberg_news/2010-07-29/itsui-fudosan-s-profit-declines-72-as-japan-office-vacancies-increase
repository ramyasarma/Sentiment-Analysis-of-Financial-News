             Mitsui Fudosan Co. , Japan’s biggest
property developer, said first-quarter profit slid 72 percent
because the company sold fewer apartments and had less leasing
revenue due to an increase in vacancy rates.  
 Net income  dropped to 4.49 billion yen ($51 million) in the
three months ended June 30 from 16.1 billion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based company said in a statement today. Sales
declined 9.2 percent to 282.9 billion yen in the quarter from
311.5 billion yen a year ago.  
 Japanese developers face a slump in demand for Tokyo’s
condominium market and record-high office vacancies as the
country’s  unemployment rate  remains above 5 percent and
companies cut spending. Mitsui Fudosan said today sales of homes
and apartments in the quarter dropped 35 percent from year ago.  
 The company’s division comprising housing, office buildings
and land sales had an operating loss of 1.9 billion yen in the
quarter compared with a profit of 15.8 billion yen a year ago,
the firm said.  
 Mitsui Fudosan  sold 885 condominiums and single houses to
individuals in the quarter, fewer than the 1,355 it sold in the
same period last year, the company said. Its inventory of
condominiums and houses fell to 837 at the end of June from 912
in the previous quarter.  
 Mitsui Fudosan’s  shares , which dropped by 15 percent this
year, declined 1.5 percent to close at 1,332 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. The earnings results were released after the
close of trading.  
 Annual Target Kept  
 Mitsui Fudosan maintained its full-year  profit forecast  of
50 billion yen on sales of 1.44 trillion yen.  
 Mitsui Fudosan plans to sell 5,400 condominiums in the
current business year through March 2011. The firm said today it
has secured sales contracts amounting to about 55 percent of the
annual target.  
 Condominiums put up for sales in Tokyo region declined for
a fifth straight year in 2009, to 36,376 units, according to the
 Real Estate Economic Institute Co. , a Tokyo-based industry
publisher.  
 Operating profit, sales minus operating costs, from leasing,
the company’s biggest division, fell 2.7 percent to 23.7 billion
yen in the period as vacancy rates for office and commercial
buildings in Mitsui Fudosan’s portfolio rose to a six-year high
of 3.3 percent in the quarter from 3.1 percent in March.  
 Mitsui Fudosan expects a  decline  of 4.8 percent in
operating profit for its leasing business this fiscal year due
to the office vacancies and the cost of redeveloping existing
properties, the company said on April 30.  
 Tokyo’s office vacancy rate rose to 9.1 percent in June,
the highest since Miki Shoji Co., a privately held office
brokerage company, started compiling monthly data in January
2001.
