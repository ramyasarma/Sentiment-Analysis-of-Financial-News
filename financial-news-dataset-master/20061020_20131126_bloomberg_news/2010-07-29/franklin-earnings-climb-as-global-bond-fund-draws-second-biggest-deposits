             Franklin Resources Inc ., manager of
the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, said fiscal third-
quarter earnings rose 21 percent as deposits in its global bond
fund ranked second behind  Bill Gross ’s Pimco Total Return Fund.  
 Net income for the quarter ended June 30 rose to $360.5
million, or $1.58 a share, from $297.7 million, or a revised
$1.28, a year earlier, the San Mateo, California-based company
said today in a statement. The average  estimate  of 18 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.50 a share.  
 Franklin benefited from investors who favored bonds over
stocks as its $34.6 billion  Templeton Global Bond Fund  attracted
$8.8 billion in the first half of the year, topped only by the
$20.9 billion deposited in the $234 billion Pimco Total Return,
the world’s biggest bond fund, according to data compiled by
 Morningstar Inc . U.S. fixed-income funds attracted $139 billion
through June, compared with $2.6 billion for equity funds,
Chicago-based Morningstar’s estimates show.  
 “They should be the best in the industry when it comes to
flows,”  Douglas Sipkin , a New York-based analyst with
Ticonderoga Securities, said in a telephone interview before
Franklin announced earnings.  
 Franklin rose $3.58, or 3.7 percent, to $99.82 at 4:10 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock declined
5.2 percent this year, compared with a 7.4 percent decrease for
Standard & Poor’s 15-company  index  of asset managers and custody
banks.  
 Franklin attracted $18.8 billion from investors during the
quarter, Chief Executive Officer  Gregory Johnson  said in a pre-
recorded presentation on the company’s website. Global and
international bond funds accounted for $16.7 billion of the
deposits.  
 Hasenstab’s Appeal  
 The Templeton Global Bond Fund, run by  Michael Hasenstab ,
gained 11 percent annually for the past five years,  better  than
98 percent of rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The $26.7 billion version of the fund sold outside the U.S.
brought in $11.7 billion through June, according to  Strategic
Insight , a New York-based research firm.  
 Franklin had $236 billion in equity assets under management
and $227 billion in bonds at the end of June, according to a
statement on July 12. The company was helped by the 11 percent
gain including dividends in the  MSCI World Index , which tracks
global stock values, in the year ended June 30.  
 “Assuming we ever get a shift back into equities, Franklin
is well positioned,”  Michael Kim , an analyst with Sandler
O’Neill & Partners LP in New York, said in a telephone interview
before Franklin released results.
