             Santander U.K., a unit of  Spain ’s
 Banco Santander SA (SAN) , said it plans to hire over 600 new workers
in the second half as the bank increases mortgage lending.  
 The new jobs will include additional employees for branches
and administration roles, the bank said today in a statement.  
 “Our transformation into a full-service commercial bank is
progressing,” said Santander U.K. Chief Executive Officer
Antonio Horta Osorio in the statement. The bank is “investing
to support growth,” he said.  
 Santander’s U.K. operations include the former businesses
of former building societies including Abbey, Alliance &
Leicester Plc and elements of Bradford & Bingley Plc. It may
sell a stake in its British unit through an initial public
offering in London, CEO Alfredo Saenz said today. The bank,
which has more than 1,300 branches, is in the final stages of
talks to buy more than 300 branches from  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc  and expects a “solution” next month, he said.  
 The bank said it increased its lending to “small and
medium-sized” businesses by 21 percent to 7.5 billion pounds.  
 Net mortgage lending rose 67 percent to 3.3 billion pounds
from a year earlier, though that marked a decline from 5.6
billion pounds in the second half of 2009. Gross loans rose 14
percent to 12.3 billion pounds, while capital repayments reached
9 billion pounds.  
 Santander U.K.’s home-loan market share was 19.1 percent,
compared with 16.3 percent in the first half of 2009. The bank’s
ratio of non-performing loans declined to 1.42 percent from 1.43
percent in the first quarter, the company said.
