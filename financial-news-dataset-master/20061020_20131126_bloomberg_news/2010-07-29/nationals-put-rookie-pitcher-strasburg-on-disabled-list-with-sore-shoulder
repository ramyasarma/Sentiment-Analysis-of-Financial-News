             The  Washington Nationals  put rookie
pitcher  Stephen Strasburg  on the 15-day disabled list because of
an inflamed shoulder, team spokesman John Dever said.  
 Strasburg, 22, was scratched from a start against the
Atlanta Braves two days ago because his shoulder was stiff and
he had trouble getting loose during warm-ups. He was replaced by
 Miguel Batista , who threw five scoreless innings in his first
start this season to lead the Nationals to a 3-0 victory.  
 The team won’t have any comment on Strasburg’s move to the
disabled list, Dever said.  
 General Manager Mike Rizzo told  MLB.com  that Strasburg had
similar problems while playing for San Diego State University.
There is no damage to the shoulder, he said. An X-ray was
negative and a magnetic resonance imaging test looked the same
as the one taken after Strasburg signed his contract a year ago,
Rizzo told MLB.com.  
 Strasburg, the No. 1 pick in the 2009 draft, signed a
record $15 million contract. He is 5-2 with a 2.32 earned run
average with the Nationals.
