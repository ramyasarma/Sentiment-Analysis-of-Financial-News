             China may issue rules next month
that allow insurers to increase the amount of assets they are
allowed to invest in so-called yuan-denominated A-shares, A-
share funds, bond funds and money market funds, the Shanghai
Securities News reported today, without citing anyone.  
 Insurers may be allowed to invest 25 percent of their
assets in A-shares, A-share funds, bond funds and money market
funds, rising from the current 20 percent, the Shanghai-based
newspaper reported.
