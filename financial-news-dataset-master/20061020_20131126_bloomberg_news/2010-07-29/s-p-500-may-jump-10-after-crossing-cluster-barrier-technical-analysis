             The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
rally more than 10 percent if it overcomes a “cluster” of
resistance, according to an analysis of chart patterns by IG
Markets Ltd.  
 The benchmark for U.S. equities may climb to this year’s
intraday high of 1,219.80 from yesterday’s close of 1,106.13,
according to  Chris Weston , a Melbourne-based institutional
dealer at IG Markets.  
 That move is possible if the gauge rises above its 200-day
moving average of 1,114.12, its 100-day moving average of
1,128.34, its previous high of 1,131.23 reached June 21 and
finally above a key  Fibonacci  resistance level of 1,140.  
 The S&P 500 “needs to break through this next cluster of
resistance before we can start to become optimistic again,”
Weston said, without specifying a time period.  
 The S&P 500 has fallen 9.3 percent from this year’s high on
April 26 on concern Europe’s government-debt crisis, China’s
steps to curb property-price inflation and signs of weakening in
the U.S. economy will crimp global growth.  
 Since closing below its 200-day  moving average  on May 20,
the S&P 500 crossed the average to close above it on June 15 and
July 26.  
 “It’s encouraging that the S&P 500 rose above its 200-day
moving average,” Weston said. “But it’s done this before in
the past few months, only to fall back.”
