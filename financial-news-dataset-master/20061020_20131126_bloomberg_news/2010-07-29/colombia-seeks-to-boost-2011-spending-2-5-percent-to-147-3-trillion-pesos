             Colombia plans to raise spending
next year in an effort to reduce poverty, bolster the economy
and create jobs.  
 The government will submit a plan to Congress that calls
for raising budgeted spending next year by 2.5 percent to 147.3
trillion pesos ($79.9 billion), according to a presentation
today in Bogota attended by Finance Minister  Oscar Ivan Zuluaga .
The spending called for in the 2011 budget is equivalent to 25.9
percent of gross domestic product.  
 Zuluaga, who stands down Aug. 7 when President  Alvaro Uribe 
leaves office, gave details about the budget, entitled “Toward
Macroeconomic Stability.” The government has said it expects
economic growth of 4 percent in 2011. Colombia Planning Director
 Esteban Piedrahita  said growth will be more than 4 percent this
year, revising the government’s previous 3 percent forecast.  
 The plan includes 22.3 trillion pesos in defense and
security spending and 21 trillion pesos on education. An
additional 37.4 trillion will go toward paying debt.  
 South America’s fourth-biggest economy emerged from its
first recession in a decade in the fourth quarter. The recovery
from the global economic slump has been slower in Colombia than
in other South American nations, partly due to a diplomatic
dispute with Venezuela that caused a 71 percent slump in exports
to the country in the first five months of the year.  
 IMF Forecast  
 Colombia’s economy will grow 2.25 percent in 2010, the
slowest in South America after Venezuela, which is still in
recession, according to an International Monetary Fund forecast.
The IMF expects Peru and Brazil to grow more than 6 percent.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects Colombia’s economy to
grow 4 percent this year, up from a previous forecast of 3.4
percent, it said in a report July 26. The forecast for 2011
growth was unchanged at 3.8 percent, the bank said.  
 The central government will have a deficit of 3.9 percent
of GDP in 2011, down from an expected 4.4 percent in 2010, and a
consolidated budget deficit of 3 percent next year, down from
3.6 percent this year.  
 Uribe, who will be replaced by his former Defense Minister
 Juan Manuel Santos , has sought to increase social spending for
the poorest Colombians. His success in the war against rebel
fighters helped boost consumer and business confidence, stoking
the economy.  
 Santos, who named  Juan Carlos Echeverry  his finance
minister, has promised annual economic growth of 6 percent
within two years. He plans to achieve that while balancing the
budget, creating 2.4 million jobs and expanding the housing,
infrastructure and oil and mining industries.  
 Echeverry has said Colombia should capitalize on its oil
and mining riches to reduce debt and create a fiscal
stabilization fund that would cushion the economy during crises.
Congress is studying a plan to cut debt as a percentage of GDP
to 28.4 percent by 2020 from a projected 39.4 percent this year.
