             Irish government bonds fell relative
to German bunds as investors judged they recovered too quickly
this month from declines prompted by concern some European
nations would struggle to repay debt.  
 German 10-year bonds rose on speculation that bond fund
managers are adding securities to rebalance their holdings to
adjust to changes in indexes they use to measure performance.
Italian bonds were little changed after it sold 9.5 billion
euros ($12.4 billion) of securities. An index of executive and
consumer sentiment in the 16 euro nations rose to 101.3 from 99
in June, the European Commission said, beating the median of 26
economist estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “There is some profit taking,” said  Peter Chatwell , a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “There have been much stronger index
extension flows into European bonds this month compared to the
U.S.”  
 Irish 10-year bond yields climbed 4 basis points to 5.1
percent as of 5:25 p.m. in London. That widened the yield
difference between the securities and benchmark bunds 10 basis
points to 233 basis points, according to generic data compiled
by Bloomberg.  
 Ten-year German yields fell four basis points to 2.71
percent, while two-year yields dropped two basis point to 0.83
percent.  
 German  unemployment  fell for a 13th month in July, the
Federal Labor Agency in Nuremberg said today. The number of
people out of work declined a seasonally adjusted 20,000 to 3.21
million, the lowest since November 2008, and in line with the
median estimate before the data was published. The adjusted
jobless rate declined to 7.6 percent.  
 Bond Returns  
 Irish and Spanish government bonds both returned 3.5
percent this month, the biggest gainers in the euro region,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. U.K. gilts handed
investors a loss of 1.4 percent and German debt 1 percent, the
worst returns among the 26 countries tracked in the indexes.  
 Those trends were helped after only seven of 91 European
banks examined by regulators last week failed tests designed to
show they can withstand another recession and sovereign-debt
crisis. The Committee of European Banking Supervisors said on
July 23 the banks that failed had a combined capital shortfall
of 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion).  
 “After the release of bank stress tests last week,
sovereign spreads have continued tightening,”  Marek Sasura , an
analyst at Barclays Capital in London, wrote in a research
report today.  
 Italian Spread  
 German government bonds returned 5.9 percent this year,
U.S. Treasuries 6.1 percent, and 4.5 percent for U.K. gilts, the
indexes show.  
 Italian 10-year yields rose two basis points relative to
German bunds, for a spread of 125 basis points, as a report
showed business confidence in the Mediterranean nation advanced
to a two-year high in July. The spread was at 153 basis points
at the beginning on July.  
 The  Portuguese-German spread  widened seven basis points, to
240 basis points, after narrowing from 297 basis points at the
beginning of the month.  
 Italy priced 3.5 billion euros of three-year bonds to yield
2.01 percent down from 2.33 percent at the previous sale on June
28. Investors bid 1.39 times the amount of the bonds offered,
matching the bid-to-cover ratio in June.  
 Italian Budget  
 The treasury also sold 3.5 billion euros of 10-year bonds
to yield 3.92 percent, compared with a 4.09 percent rate at the
previous sale a month ago. The bid-to-cover ratio was 1.33
times, compared with 1.29 in June. The treasury also sold 2.5
billion euros of floating-rate notes due in 2015 that were
priced with an average yield of 1.7 percent and had a bid-to-
cover ratio of 1.44 times the offer.  
 Italy’s Chamber of Deputies today voted to give final
approval to a two-year budget adjustment aimed at cutting the
nations’s budget deficit by 25 billion euros. The spending
package aims to lower the deficit below the European Union’s 3
percent of gross domestic product ceiling by the end of 2012.  
 Standard & Poor’s today said the budget cuts support the
country’s A+ rating on long-term debt, according to a statement.
