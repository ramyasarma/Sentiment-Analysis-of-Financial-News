             Statoil ASA, Norway’s largest oil
and natural gas company, maintained its equity production target
for 2010 and cut its forecast for 2012 to 2.060 million to 2.160
million barrels of oil equivalent a day. That compares with a
previous forecast of 2.1 million to 2.2 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day for 2012.
