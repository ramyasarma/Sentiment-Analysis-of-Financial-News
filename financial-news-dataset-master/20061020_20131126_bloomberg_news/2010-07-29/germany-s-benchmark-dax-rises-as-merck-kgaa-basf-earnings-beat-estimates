             German stocks  retreated for a second
day as investors remained concerned about the strength of the
economic recovery, even after companies in the DAX index
reported earnings that beat estimates.  
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG and MAN SE led declining shares, both
losing more than 3 percent.  Merck KGaA  led gains in the
benchmark DAX Index after saying second-quarter net income
advanced 69 percent and raising its forecast for 2010.
Volkswagen AG, Europe’s largest carmaker, advanced 3.1 percent
as second-quarter net income surpassed analysts’ estimates.  
 The  DAX  Index retreated 0.7 percent to 6,134.7, extending
yesterday’s 0.5 percent decline. The measure has fallen 3.1
percent from this year’s high on April 26 amid concern that the
economic recovery is losing steam as indebted European
governments slash spending and China takes steps to cool its
economy. The broader  HDAX Index  slipped 0.8 percent today.  
 “Everybody expected strong figures from MAN SE and is now
selling on good news,” said Christian Falkner, an analyst at
Alpha Wertpapierhandels AG in Frankfurt. “Some of Lufthansa’s
competitors already reported good numbers, so investors had
anticipated good Lufthansa earnings.”  
 Lufthansa , Europe’s second-biggest airline, tumbled 4.5
percent to 12.22 euros, even after reporting more than doubled
quarterly profit.  MAN SE , the region’s third-largest truckmaker,
sank 3.9 percent to 70.12 euros, even after reporting a second
straight quarter of profit as demand for heavy trucks in the
region recovers.  
 Continental Slips  
 Continental AG , Europe’s second-largest auto-parts
supplier, lost 1.3 percent to 48.03 euros after posting second-
quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates. Net income was
121 million euros ($158.3 million), compared with a 190 million-
euro loss a year earlier. Analysts had forecast profit of 187
million euros, according to the average of five estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Puma AG sank 6.1 percent to 221.60 euros. Europe’s second-
largest sporting-goods maker posted second-quarter profit below
analysts’ estimates as the company’s European sales benefited
less from the soccer World Cup than its rivals.  
 Gildemeister AG  dropped 4 percent to 10.63 euros. The
German cutting-tool maker founded in 1870 reported a second-
quarter net loss of 4.3 million euros compared with a profit of
3.2 million euros a year earlier.  
 Merck, Volkswagen Gain  
 Merck  surged 4.6 percent to 67.16 euros, its largest gain
since June 2009. The maker of drugs and chemicals said net
income climbed to 183.4 million euros from 108.5 million euros a
year earlier. Core earnings, which exclude costs such as
writedowns and merger expenses, were 1.44 euros a share, beating
the 1.36 euros average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 Volkswagen  rallied 3.1 percent to 80.99 euros, its highest
price since October 2009, after the carmaker reported its
biggest quarterly net income in two years on higher demand in
China and the U.S. for the Golf compact and Audi A5 coupe.  
 Second-quarter net income quadrupled to 1.25 billion euros
from 283 million euros a year earlier. Profit beat the 721
million-euro median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Sales rose 22 percent to 33.2 billion euros.
