             Cap Gemini SA , Europe’s largest
computer services  company , raised its profitability forecast as
first-half net income rose.  
 Operating margin “should exceed 6.5 percent” for 2010 as
a whole, the Paris-based company said in a statement today. Cap
Gemini had earlier targeted a margin rate between 6 percent and
6.5 percent. First-half net income rose 29.5 percent to 101
million euros ($131 million), the company said today.  
 Computer-services companies are looking to preserve
revenue as governments cut spending to reduce debt. Yesterday,
 Atos Origin SA , the second-largest French computer-services
provider, said it would reduce its U.K. public sector workforce
by 5 percent to cope with expected cuts.  
 “The Group will enjoy a return to growth in the second
half of the year,” Cap Gemini Chief Executive Officer  Paul Hermelin  said in the statement.
