             Oil & Natural Gas Corp. , India’s
biggest energy explorer, reported a 25 percent drop in first-
quarter profit after discounts on crude oil sales to state
refiners increased.  
 Net income  fell to 36.6 billion rupees ($785 million) in
the three months ended June 30, from 48.5 billion rupees a year
earlier, the New Delhi-based company said in a statement today.
That compares with the 38.5 billion-rupee mean  estimate  of 16
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Lower earnings leave ONGC with less money to boost output
at aging fields in India and acquire assets overseas, including
the proposed purchase of  BP Plc ’s stake in a Vietnam venture.
Discounts to compensate refiners including  Indian Oil Corp.  for
selling fuels below cost surged almost 13 times as state-set
fuel prices lagged behind crude costs.  
 “Subsidy is the key for their profit growth and that
pulled them down this quarter,” said  Rohit Ahuja , a Mumbai-
based analyst with Centrum Broking in Mumbai. “Operationally
they have been good but for the subsidy.”  
 In the quarter oil output, including that of its joint
ventures, increased to 6.61 million metric tons from 6.55
million tons a year ago, according to the statement. Gas
production rose to 6.41 billion cubic meters from 6.39 billion
cubic meters.  
 The government controls fuel prices to help curb inflation
in Asia’s third-largest economy and requires explorers
including ONGC and  Oil India Ltd.  to sell crude to refiners
below market prices to partly offset losses on sales of
gasoline and diesel.  
 Shares Decline  
 ONGC  declined 1 percent to 1,246.55 rupees in Mumbai
trading today compared with a 0.2 percent increase in the
benchmark  Sensitive Index . The shares have climbed 5.8 percent
this year.  
 The New Delhi-based explorer sold crude oil at $48.04 a
barrel in the three months compared with $58.25 a barrel a year
ago, according to the statement. Crude oil in New York trading
averaged $81.48 a barrel in the quarter ended June 30, 17
percent higher than a year earlier. Crude for September
delivery declined as much as 48 cents or 0.6 percent, to $76.51
a barrel, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, and traded for $76.73 as of 1:08 p.m. London time.  
 The government allowed ONGC to more than double gas prices
to 6,818 rupees per thousand cubic meters from 3,200 rupees,
Information Minister  Ambika Soni  said May 19. The explorer
started charging the higher prices from June 1, Chairman and
Managing Director  R.S. Sharma  said today.  
 Gas Discoveries  
 The increase in gas rates, the first in five years, will
help ONGC add 9 billion rupees to its quarterly profit, helping
boost earnings from the three months ending September, Sharma
said.  
 The explorer is targeting net income of 140.6 billion
rupees and crude oil production of 27 million metric tons in
the financial year ending March 31, ONGC said in a March 19
statement. The company plans to spend $5 billion to develop
nine new gas discoveries off India’s east coast, which may
start production in 2016, two people with direct knowledge of
the matter said July 26.  
 ONGC’s oil production fell 2 percent to 26.46 million tons
in the last financial year and gas output increased 1 percent
to 25.6 billion cubic meters, according to a May 28  statement 
on its website. ONGC-operated fields added reserves equivalent
to 82.98 million tons of oil in the same period, the highest in
20 years, the explorer said April 27.  
 BP’s Stake  
 The company may consider bidding jointly with Vietnam Oil
& Gas Group, also known as PetroVietnam, for partner BP’s stake
in a gas field in Vietnam to secure fuel supplies, Chairman  R.S. Sharma  said July 22. Oil India, the nation’s second-biggest
state explorer, may be brought in as a partner, he said.  
 ONGC is seeking to diversify its supplies and keep pace
with India’s growing fuel needs as Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  predicts the economy will expand more than 8.5
percent in the year ending March 31 and 9 percent the following
year. The company plans to get the equivalent of  60 million 
tons of oil from overseas fields by 2025, or more than double
its output in India.  
 The explorer, which currently produces about 62 million
cubic meters a day of gas from its domestic fields, plans to
boost output to 70 million cubic meters a day by 2012 and 100
million cubic meters a day by 2016, Sharma said.
