             DuPont Co., the third-biggest U.S.
chemical maker, aims to expand sales in emerging markets by 15
percent over the next three to five years, Chief Executive
Officer Ellen Kullman said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 The company has established a business in Nigeria and
converted its South African branch office into a subsidiary to
better position it for growth in sub-Saharan Africa, Kullman
said in the statement. DuPont plans to “pursue aggressive
market growth” in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions,
she said.
