             President  Barack Obama  signed a $60
billion war-funding bill that will pay for his plan announced
last year to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.  
 The measure was approved by the Senate last week and passed
the House of Representatives yesterday over the objections of
some Democrats opposed to the war.  
 It includes $33 billion for the increase in troops in
Afghanistan, along with $5 billion in disaster assistance and
$13 billion to help pay for ailments presumed to be linked to
use of the defoliant Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.  
 Afghan war costs will top those in Iraq this year for the
first time since the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. Costs this year
will total more than those in all but two years of former
President  George W. Bush ’s administration. The measure will
bring total war expenses to $1.1 trillion.  
 Obama is sending more troops to Afghanistan to quell a
Taliban-led insurgency. He has pledged to begin bringing U.S.
forces home in July 2011, depending on conditions in the
country, while not specifying a date when the withdrawal would
be complete.  
 The bill is H.R. 4899.
