             MEG Energy Corp. raised C$700
million ($674 million) in an initial public offering of stock
after the Canadian oil-sands developer partly owned by China’s
 Cnooc Ltd.  slashed the deal’s size as much as 37 percent.  
 MEG, based in Calgary, sold 20 million shares for C$35 each
yesterday. Underwriters led by Credit Suisse Group AG were
forced to reduce the offering from 23 million shares at a price
range of C$42 to C$48 each, which would have raised up to C$1.1
billion. The company sold a 10.6 percent stake.  
 MEG joined Canadian companies including C&C Energia Ltd.
and Mitel Networks Corp. that were forced to pare back their
sales to complete their offerings this year. MEG’s sale is the
second-largest in Canada this year, after the C$1.35 billion
offering by  Athabasca Oil Sands Corp.  in April. Athabasca fell
33 percent in its first month of trading, making it Canada’s
worst-performing IPO in more than two years.  
 “Investors are sort of full up with the oil sands and have
a bad taste in the aftermath of the Athabasca deal,”  Bob Lyon ,
manager at AGF Management Ltd.’s C$196.3 million Global
Resources Class. “To some degree, MEG is paying the price for
that short history.”  
 MEG  rose  1 cent to C$35.01 as of 4:10 p.m. Toronto time in
its first day of trading. That gives it a market value of C$6.85
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 ‘Market Has Struggled’  
 “The IPO market has struggled a little bit over the past
few months,” MEG Chief Financial Officer  Dale Hohm  said in an
interview yesterday. “The key objective of this financing was
to raise the capital for the next phase of expansion at
Christina Lake, and we’ve done that.” He added: “We’re very
pleased with the results.”  
 Credit Suisse led a group of nine banks including  BMO
Nesbitt Burns , Barclays Plc and Morgan Stanley in the sale. The
banks have the option to sell another 15 percent of the offering
when the sale closes Aug. 6.  
 The company, with 2,175 square kilometers (840 square
miles) of oil-sand leases, raised money to expand its project at
Christina Lake, which has produced tar-like bitumen since 2008,
according to a July filing. MEG has 1.7 billion barrels of
proved and probable bitumen reserves as of Dec. 31, according to
independent engineering firm GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd.  
 The prospectus for the share sale shows the company plans
to expand bitumen production capacity at its Christina Lake and
Surmont projects to 260,000 barrels per day by 2020 and produce
at that rate for over 30 years.  
 $4.5 Billion in IPOs  
 Canadian companies have raised $4.5 billion in IPOs this
year, including the MEG deal, compared with $1.82 billion for
all of 2009.  
 MEG was founded by President and Chief Executive Officer
 William McCaffrey  in March 1999. Prior to founding MEG,
McCaffrey spent 17 years on business and oil-sands development
at Amoco Canada before BP Plc bought the company.  
 MEG has invested C$3.2 billion in acquisitions and asset
development since Jan. 1, 2007, and has raised more than C$2.3
billion of equity from private investors since 2007. New York-
based investment firm Warburg Pincus LLC owned about 26 percent
of MEG, while Cnooc owned a 17 percent stake before the sale,
according to filings.  
 MEG has a 50 percent stake in the Access Pipeline system
with Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corp. The 345-kilometer
system has two tubes, one of which carries bitumen to refineries
in the Edmonton, Alberta, region and the other carries diluent
used to thin bitumen for transportation back to the project.  
 The pipeline gives MEG access to Pacific Coast ports in
British Columbia and Washington state through Kinder Morgan
Energy Partners LP’s western Canadian system and would connect
with a conduit proposed by  Enbridge Inc.  that would ship bitumen
to China and other Asian countries.
