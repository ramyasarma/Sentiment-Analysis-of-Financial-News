             First Solar Inc. , the world’s
biggest maker of solar power modules, said second-quarter profit
fell as panels were held for use on its own projects, reducing
sales to customers, and as the euro declined against the dollar.  
 Net income fell to $159 million, or $1.84 a share, from
$180.6 million, or $2.11 a share, a year earlier, the Tempe,
Arizona-based company said today in a statement. Profit was
expected to be $1.603 a share, the average of 26 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales increased to $587.9
million from $525.9 million.  
 In Europe, First Solar’s largest market, a 6.6 percent
decline in the euro versus the dollar for the quarter decreased
the value of sales there. Partly to reduce reliance on revenue
from Germany and Italy, the company has been shifting more
modules to projects it’s developing for utilities in the U.S.
and Canada.  
 “They are ramping up their utility-scale projects in a
major way,” said  Daniel Ries , an analyst at Collins Stewart in
New York. He has a “buy” rating on the shares. “With three
larger projects under way they’ve begun to hold back the modules
they need, and that’s a temporary drag on revenue.”  
 First Solar fell $3, or 2.2 percent, to $132.50 as of 5:26
p.m. in late trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. By the close of
regular trading today, the stock had decreased 19 percent in the
past year.  
 Module Replacement  
 First Solar began replacing some modules that were made
from June, 2008 to June, 2009 because of “premature” declines
in power output, Chief Executive Officer  Rob Gillette  said on a
conference call. The company has accrued $27.4 million for the
replacement of about 30 megawatts of modules.  
 Sales in the U.S. are climbing as utilities seek to comply
with renewable energy requirements in California, New Jersey and
Texas. New factories in Malaysia, France and Ohio will increase
annual production capacity to 1,800 megawatts, up from the 1,100
megawatts produced in 2009, First Solar said in June.  
 “We believe that exposure to the euro will be
significantly less in 2011 given First Solar’s pipeline of North
American-based projects,” said  Mark Bachman , an analyst at
Auriga USA in New York who has a “buy” rating on the shares.  
 Increased throughput has helped reduce manufacturing costs
to 76 cents per watt from 81 cents in the first quarter, and
will help boost annual production capacity to as much as 2,200
megawatts by 2012, the company said.
