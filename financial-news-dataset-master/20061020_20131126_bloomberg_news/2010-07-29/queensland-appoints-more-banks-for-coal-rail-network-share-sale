             Queensland appointed more banks to
help manage a planned initial share sale of the state’s coal
tracks and trains, Australia’s biggest railroad, scheduled for
the end of this year.  
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. and Wilson HTM
Investment Group were named as co-lead managers for the share
sale of Brisbane-based QR National, the Queensland state
government said in an e-mailed statement. Ord Minnett Group Ltd.
and Patersons Securities Ltd. were appointed co-managers.  
 “These institutions are key to the retail market and have
come on board as we look towards a planned listing by year’s
end,” Treasurer  Andrew Fraser  said. The government hasn’t said
how much it intends to raise from the share sale.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd., Xstrata Plc and 11 other coal miners in
Australia bid A$4.85 billion ($4.4 billion) in May for the coal
railroad in Queensland to head off the state government’s
planned initial public offering. Citigroup Inc. is advising the
producers on its offer.  
 Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs JBWere, Merrill Lynch,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG were named by
Queensland in March as joint lead managers for the share sale.
