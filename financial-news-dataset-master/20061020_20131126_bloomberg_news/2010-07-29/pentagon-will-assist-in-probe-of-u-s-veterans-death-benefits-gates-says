             Defense Secretary Robert Gates said
the Defense Department will “do everything we can” to help the
Department of Veterans Affairs in its investigation of how
insurance companies reap profits from death benefits retained
for the families of deceased military personnel.  
 “I will be very interested in the outcome of the VA
investigation,” Gates told a Pentagon press briefing. “We will
do everything we can to help.”  
 “Until today I actually believed that the families of our
fallen heroes got a check for the full amount of their
benefits,” Gates said. “This came as news to me.”
