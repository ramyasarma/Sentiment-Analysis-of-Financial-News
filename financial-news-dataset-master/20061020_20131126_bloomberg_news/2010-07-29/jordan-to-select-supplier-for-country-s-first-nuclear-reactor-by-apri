             Jordan will select the supplier of
its first nuclear reactor by April from among three designs, the
Middle Eastern kingdom’s regulator said.  
 “The competitive dialogue process should be completed with
the selection of the best technical and economic offer by April
2011,”  Khalid Touqan , chairman of the  Jordan Atomic Energy
Commission , said in an interview in Amman.  
 The commission and Worley Parsons, Australia’s biggest
engineering company, will hold talks until then with the pre-
selected groups of Canadian, French, Japanese and Russian
bidders, Touqan said.  
 Jordan, much of which is covered by desert, relies almost
entirely on imports for its energy needs. It signed nuclear-
cooperation agreements to diversify its power supply and plans
to build its first atomic plant by 2019.  
 Touqan said the commission preselected three reactor
technologies on May 12:  Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd .’s Enhanced
CANDU 6 (EC6), Russia’s ZAO Atomstroyexport’s AES-92 VVER-1000
and “ATMEA1,” proposed by Paris-based  Atmea , a 50-50 joint-
venture between France’s  Areva SA  and Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd.  
 Areva , the world’s largest maker of nuclear reactors,
signed agreements with Jordan this year for the protection of
the planned nuclear installations and the exploration and mining
of uranium in the kingdom.  
 Jordan estimates it has 65,000 tons of uranium deposits and
expects annual production of 2,000 tons.
