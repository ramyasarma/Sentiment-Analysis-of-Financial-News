             Sofia Coppola ’s “Somewhere” and
 Julian Schnabel ’s movie about the creation of Israel are two of
the 23 contenders at this year’s  Venice Film Festival .  Quentin Tarantino  heads the jury that will pick the winner.  
 The festival, which runs Sept. 1 to 11 on Lido island,
opens with  Darren Aronofsky’s  “ Black Swan ,” a psychological
thriller about rival ballerinas starring  Natalie Portman . The
director is a runner-up for the top Golden Lion award, which he
won two years ago with “The Wrestler” starring  Mickey Rourke .  
 Lindsay Lohan ,  Michelle Rodriguez  and  Jessica Alba  star in
the eagerly anticipated world premiere of “Machete,” an
action film (not in the official competition) by  Robert Rodriguez , who co-wrote “Grindhouse” with Tarantino. A homage
to drive-in B-movies, it screens at midnight on the festival’s
first day.  
 The selection was revealed today at a Rome news
conference. Organizers said a surprise title would be announced
Sept. 6.  
 Schnabel’s Israel-themed “Miral” stars Freida Pinto,
 Willem Dafoe  and  Vanessa Redgrave . Another movie in the running
for the Lion: French director  Francois Ozon ’s “Potiche,”
starring  Catherine Deneuve .  
 Closing the festival, Oscar-winning British actress  Helen Mirren  will take over the male lead in Shakespeare’s “The
Tempest” to play a character named “Prospera” in  Julie Taymor ’s cinematic take on the classic, which co-stars  Russell Brand .  
 Joaquin Phoenix  
 Screening out of the competition is  Casey Affleck ’s
documentary “I’m Still Here: The Lost Year of  Joaquin Phoenix ,” which tracks the actor’s life after he quit movies
to become a rapper. Casey’s brother  Ben Affleck  directs and
stars in “The Town,” with Rebecca Hall.  
 Director  Martin Scorsese ’s documentary about director  Elia Kazan  (“A Letter to Elia”) and actor-director  John Turturro ’s
documentary “Passione” about Neapolitan song will also
premiere at Venice.
