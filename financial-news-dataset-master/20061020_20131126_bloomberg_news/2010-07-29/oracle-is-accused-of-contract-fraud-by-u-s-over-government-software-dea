             The U.S. filed a complaint against
 Oracle Corp ., the world’s second-largest software maker, saying
the company overcharged the government on a contract involving
hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.  
 Oracle failed to disclose discounts that it gave its most
favored commercial customers, according to a complaint filed
today by the Justice Department in federal court in Alexandria,
Virginia. The government must get the company’s best prices,
according to the complaint.  
 “We take seriously allegations that a government
contractor has dealt dishonestly with the United States,” said
 Tony West , assistant attorney general for the Justice
Department’s civil division, in a statement. “When contractors
misrepresent their business practices to the government,
taxpayers suffer.”  
 The Justice Department said in a statement that the
software contract was in effect from 1998 to 2006 “and involved
hundreds of millions of dollars in sales.”  
 A former Oracle employee, Paul Frascella, filed the case in
May 2007 under the False Claims Act, which lets private citizens
sue on behalf of the government and share in any recovery. The
government joined Frascella’s case on April 2, when it was
unsealed.  
 The government filed its own version of the complaint today
after previously intervening in the case.  
 Deborah Hellinger , a spokeswoman for Redwood City,
California-based Oracle, didn’t return a phone call and e-mail
seeking comment.  
 Microsoft Corp., based in Redmond, Washington, is the
world’s largest software maker.
