             Mortgage rates  for U.S. homes set a
record low for the sixth straight week, potentially freeing up
money for consumers to spend elsewhere.  
 Investors seeking the relative safety of bonds backed by
government-controlled home finance companies Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac drove the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage
down to 4.54 percent in the week ended today from 4.56 percent
last week, McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac said. The average
15-year rate was 4 percent, also a record in the data going back
to 1971, the company said in a statement.  
 “It’s not going to help out everybody but it will help,”
said  Dana Johnson , chief economist at Comerica Inc. in New York.
“Lower rates are a mechanism by which the economy can
strengthen over time.”  
 Falling rates have done little to boost housing  demand  that
plunged after a federal tax credit of as much as $8,000 expired
April 30. The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index of home-loan
applications fell 4.4 percent in the week ended July 23,
approaching the 13-year low touched earlier this month, the
Washington-based group said.  
 The number of Americans filing first-time  claims  for
unemployment insurance fell to 457,000 last week, a figure that
signals the labor market will be slow to improve even as the
economy expands. The 10-year weekly  average  for initial claims
is 390,700, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “The labor markets are still tentative and so we’ll have
to see that improve before we see housing really improve,” said
 George Mokrzan , chief economist at Huntington National Bank in
Columbus. “Banks are just as interested in people’s employment
as the people themselves.”  
 Overall Economic Growth  
 Growth in the world’s largest economy will average 2.8
percent from the current quarter through the second quarter of
2011, according to the median estimate of 52 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News from July 1 to July 8, down 0.1 percentage
point from last month.  
 Low-interest home refinancings are one economic driver that
may help because they free-up cash, Johnson said.  
 At the current 30-year rate, monthly payments for a
$100,000 loan would be about $509, down $43 from a year ago.  
 Personal consumption in the U.S. is expected to have risen
2.4 percent in the second quarter, according to the average
estimate of 20 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The latest
figures are scheduled for release tomorrow.
