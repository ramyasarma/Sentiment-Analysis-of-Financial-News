             Kazakhmys Plc , Kazakhstan’s biggest
copper producer, said first-half output of finished metal from
its own ore fell 3.4 percent because it processed fewer
stockpiles than a year earlier.  
 Output declined to 164,300 metric tons, from 170,100 tons a
year earlier, London-based Kazakhmys said in a statement today.
It plans to produce more than 300,000 tons of copper this year.  
 “Mining, processing and smelting have all met or exceeded
targets,” Chief Executive Officer  Oleg Novachuk  said in the
statement. “Customer demand remains firm for our metals and our
objective will be to maintain our operational consistency in the
second half of 2010.”  
 Output of copper in concentrate was 169,400 tons, 5 percent
lower than a year earlier, Kazakhmys said. “This decrease
reflects the 3 percent reduction in metal in ore mined, as well
as the additional copper in concentrate, produced” in the first
half of 2009 “from previously stockpiled ore.”  
 The company’s output of zinc contained in concentrate, an
intermediate product shipped to refineries, rose 5.9 percent to
80,900 tons. Silver production fell 27 percent to 6.7 million
ounces, while gold declined 8.1 percent to 62,400 ounces.
