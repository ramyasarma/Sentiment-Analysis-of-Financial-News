             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade as hot, dry weather may
reduce grain crops in Russia, Ukraine and parts of Europe,
boosting demand for supplies from the U.S., the biggest
exporter, said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in
Fowler, Indiana.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago after a government report showed increased  demand  for
U.S. inventories, Gerlach said. Soybean-meal futures may open $2
to $3 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to
open up 0.05 cent to 0.2 cent a pound, he said.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 9 cents to 11 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
 export sales  in the week ended July 22 were more than double the
previous week, as drought reduced supplies in Russia, Ukraine
and parts of Europe, Gerlach said.
