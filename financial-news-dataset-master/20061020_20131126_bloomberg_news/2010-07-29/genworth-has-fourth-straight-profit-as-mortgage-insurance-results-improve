             Genworth Financial Inc. , the
mortgage guarantor and life insurer, reported a profit for a
fourth straight quarter as results improved in its business
backing home loans.  
 Second-quarter  net income  was $77 million, or 16 cents a
share, compared with a loss of $50 million, or 11 cents, in the
year-earlier period, the Richmond, Virginia-based insurer said
today in a  statement  distributed by PR Newswire. Operating
income, which excludes some investment results, was 31 cents a
share, beating the 28-cent average  estimate  of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Genworth, led by Chief Executive Officer  Michael Fraizer, 
is among mortgage insurers tightening underwriting standards and
raising prices to recover from losses that started in 2008. The
insurer said in February it expects the mortgage unit to report
quarterly profits by mid-2011 as the quality of underwriting
improves.  
 These are not “normal times,” for mortgage insurers, said
 Eric Berg , an analyst with Barclays Capital in New York, who has
an “overweight/positive” rating on Genworth. “We were not
expecting the mortgage insurance business to be profitable in
the second quarter, but we were expecting the loss to shrink,”
he said. The insurers pay lenders when homeowners default and
foreclosure fails to recoup costs.  
 U.S. Mortgage Insurance  
 Genworth reported $40 million in operating losses in the
U.S. mortgage-insurance segment, compared with a $134 million
loss in the year-earlier quarter. International mortgage gains
were $105 million, compared with $87 million.  
 Genworth has gained  more than 39 percent in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading this year and is the third-best
performer in the 24-company  KBW Insurance Index  in the same
period. It rose 23 cents to $15.79 at 4 p.m. in New York trading
before the earnings announcement.  
 PMI Group Inc.  posted a second-quarter loss today that
missed analysts’ estimates on increased paid claims. PMI, based
in Walnut Creek, California, fell about 15 percent.  MGIC
Investment Corp. , the largest U.S. mortgage guarantor, last week
posted its first profit in 12 quarters on lower claims costs.  
 The industry sold $81.8 billion of coverage last year, a 58
percent decline from 2008, according to data compiled by  Inside
Mortgage Finance , a trade publication. In the second quarter,
housing sales recovered and the U.S.  unemployment  rate fell to
9.5 percent, down from a quarter-century high of 10.5 percent in
October.  
 Delinquencies  
 Borrowers caught up on overdue mortgages faster than new
delinquencies were reported on insured home loans in February
for the first time in almost four years, a trend that continued
in March, April and May. The  ratio of cures  to defaults on
guaranteed loans was 1.08 in May compared with .60 a year
earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Insurance Companies
of America.  
 Darin Arita , a Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. analyst who
 rates  Genworth a “hold,” said the period of losses may be
ending. “A lot of that comes from the government programs, and
a lot of that comes from buyers who were delinquent and are now
paying,” he said in an interview before the earnings release.  
 The U.S. government’s  Making Home Affordable  loan-
modification program permanently changed more than 230,000
mortgages through March. About 781,000 trial modifications  were
under way  through March, up from about 487,000 in  September ,
according to the government.  
 Revenue in the second quarter totaled $2.4 billion,
compared with $2.48 billion in the year-earlier period. Revenue
from premiums fell to $1.47 billion from $1.5 billion. Life
insurance revenue increased to $64 million from $49 million.  
 Net investment losses widened to $76 million from $59
million in last year’s second quarter.
