             China Southern Airlines Co. , the
nation’s biggest airline by fleet size, rose to the highest in
almost three months in Hong Kong after saying first-half profit
may have risen 5,000 percent.  
 The carrier  jumped  3.6 percent to close at HK$3.77 in Hong
Kong, the highest level since May 6. The shares added 0.3
percent to 7.39 yuan in Shanghai.  
 Demand for aviation services is gaining on a rebound in the
domestic economy, China Southern said in a  filing  to Hong Kong’s
exchange yesterday. The global airline industry may post
combined net income for the first time in three years as travel
demand revives this year after the worst recession in more than
six decades, according to the  International Air Transport
Association .  
 “Air travel and transport demand is on an accelerated pace
of growth,” analysts including Zhang Xinye at China Minzu
Securities Co. in Beijing, wrote in a note to clients today.
“Chinese domestic airlines in the first-half saw increased
passenger demand and ticket prices are also on the rise.”  
 China Southern, which reported a net income of 25 million
yuan ($3.7 million) for the first half in 2009, also improved
operational efficiency, according to the filing.  
 The carrier will also report in the first half a gain from
the disposal of its stake in MTU Maintenance Zhuhai Co., it
said. The airline said in April it sold the 50 percent stake for
1.6 billion yuan.  
 Last year, the carrier’s first-half profit slumped 97
percent as increased passenger numbers failed to offset a lack
of currency gains.
