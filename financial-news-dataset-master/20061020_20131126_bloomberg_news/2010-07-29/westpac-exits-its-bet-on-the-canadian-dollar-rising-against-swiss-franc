             Westpac Banking Corp. exited a bet
that the Canadian dollar would rally to its strongest level this
month against the Swiss franc after the loonie failed to break
through a key level amid weaker-than-expected economic data.  
 “We had expected an oversold cross combined with a
supportive trend in yield spreads to produce a decent bounce to
1.05,”  Richard Franulovich , a senior strategist in New York,
wrote in a client note. Canada’s currency “only managed to
rally to just through 1.03 before reversing. The fatal shot was
a result of weak Canadian data,” he said.  
 The Canadian dollar declined for a second day against its
Swiss counterpart and was at 1.0085 franc as of 2:08 p.m. in
London. The loonie hasn’t traded at 1.05 or stronger against its
Swiss counterpart since June 29, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Canadian factory product prices dropped by the most in more
than a year in June, a report showed today. The industrial
product price index fell 0.9 percent in June from May, the most
since May 2009, Ottawa-based Statistics Canada said. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 13 economists was for a rise
of 0.2 percent.
