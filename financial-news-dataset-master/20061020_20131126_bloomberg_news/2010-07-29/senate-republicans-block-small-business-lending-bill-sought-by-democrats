             Senate Republicans blocked a measure
that would cut taxes and ease credit for small businesses,
saying they objected that Democrats refused to consider their
amendments to extend tax breaks and cap federal spending.  
 The Senate voted 58-42 today to end debate on the bill,
falling short of the 60 votes required to consider the
legislation for passage.  
 “Once again a common-sense bill that would help Americans
is being held hostage by political calculation,” Senator  Patty Murray , a Washington Democrat, said in debate before the vote.  
 Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, said
he would work with Republicans over the next few days to seek a
compromise on which amendments would be offered. Reid said he
hopes the legislation can be passed before the Senate breaks for
its August recess.  
 The measure is aimed at easing terms for loans guaranteed
by the Small Business Administration, providing $12 billion in
tax breaks and issuing grants to states to provide business
loans.  
 It would have provided $30 billion to banks with less than
$10 billion in assets to encourage lending to small businesses.
The cost of paying back those capital infusions would decline
based on the level of small-business lending by the bank. The
aid could spur $300 billion in lending.  
 Republicans said the legislation was debated in the Senate
for three weeks, while they didn’t have the chance to offer the
amendments they desired.  
 ‘Foremost Issue’  
 “This is the foremost issue in America, and we’re saying
we don’t have time to address this issue?” Senator Olympia
Snowe, a Maine Republican, said before the vote. “Why don’t we
spend more time talking with each other to get the policy
right?”  
 Auto suppliers, community banks and franchise owners banded
together to push for the provision to boost lending, saying it
is crucial to letting them expand and hire new employees.  
 “Businesses that have enjoyed years of profits and
expansion have had loan requests rejected and credit limits
restricted,” Chris Kersting, president of the Specialty
Equipment Market Association, wrote to Congress. “The reduction
in access to capital is prolonging a stagnant economy.”  
 The legislation was faulted by Republicans such as Senator
 Richard Shelby  of Alabama for being a government rescue similar
to the $700 billion bank bailout of 2008. The program might
induce banks to make risky loans, lawmakers said.  
 “The lack of credit for small businesses is a problem that
needs to be addressed,” Shelby said during Senate debate last
week. “I do not, however, believe that we should try and solve
this problem with another expensive and bureaucratic government
program.”
