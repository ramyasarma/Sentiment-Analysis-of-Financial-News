             Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA 
and  Telemar Norte Leste SA  may raise less than the 12 billion
reais ($6.78 billion) they each plan as part of Portugal Telecom
SGPS SA’s agreement to buy a stake in Telemar,  Itau Unibanco
Holding SA  said.  
 Tele Norte and Telemar tumbled more than 8 percent
yesterday on concern investors will be diluted after the
companies said they will sell stock to existing shareholders.
Tele Norte, the parent of Brazil’s biggest fixed line telephone
company Telemar, will probably raise 2.5 billion reais at most
because Portugal Telecom and  Telemar Participacoes SA  may be the
only investors who buy shares, Itau strategist  Carlos Constantini  wrote in a note to clients today.  
 “We expect the actual capital increase to be much, much
smaller than the 12 billion reais announced,” Constantini said.  
 For Telemar Norte Leste, the capital increase may be 11.1
billion reais, with Tele Norte using money from its own share
sale to buy stock, Constantini said. Tele Norte is controlled by
closely held Telemar Participacoes.  
 Telemar Norte Leste lost 2.1 percent to 47.01 reais in Sao
Paulo trading at 11:02 a.m. New York time today after falling
8.6 percent yesterday. Tele Norte Leste slid 2.5 percent to
26.49 reais after losing 11 percent yesterday.  
 Tele Norte said in a regulatory filing yesterday that it
plans to raise 12 billion reais by selling common shares for
38.55 reais and preferred, or non-voting, stock for 28.26 reais
to existing shareholders. Telemar will also offer existing
shareholders 12 billion reais in stock, selling common shares
for 63.70 reais and preferred for 50.70 reais each, according to
the filing.  
 Portugal Telecom will pay a maximum 8.4 billion reais ($4.8
billion) for indirect and direct stakes equivalent to 22.4
percent of Oi, as Telemar is known, the companies said yesterday
in regulatory filings. Telemar also plans to acquire 10 percent
of Portugal Telecom, replacing Telefonica SA as the Portuguese
company’s biggest investor.
