             Britain’s five biggest banks,
including  HSBC Holdings Plc  and  Barclays Plc , may say profit
soared to 8.4 billion pounds ($13.1 billion) in the first half
as falling bad loan provisions mitigate slowing growth in
investment-banking revenue.  
 Net income in the six months to the end of June probably
rose from 281 million pounds in the year-earlier period,
according to median estimates from analysts in a telephone and
e-mail survey by Bloomberg News. HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group Plc,
Standard Chartered Plc, Barclays and  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc  report from Aug. 2 to Aug. 6.  
 “Impairments will be substantially better,” said  Alan Beaney , who helps manage about 200 million pounds at R.C. Brown
Investment Management in Bristol, England. “Banks took very
aggressive writedowns last year and some of those were for a
worst-case scenario which has not transpired.”  
 Britain’s banks are benefiting from a decline in
provisions, having set aside 35 billion-pounds for bad debts a
year ago during the country’s worst recession since World War
II. That will help offset a slowdown in investment banking
revenue, which was “softer” in the second quarter, Barclays’s
Finance Director  Chris Lucas  said on June 30.  
 HSBC may say net income rose 83 percent to $6.14 billion
from $3.35 billion, according to the median estimate of nine
analysts in the Bloomberg News survey.  
 Losses Narrow  
 Bad debts fell with the closure to new customers of its
former U.S. subprime consumer finance operation last year.
Losses in North America probably narrowed to $1.1 billion from
$3.7 billion, analyst  Carla Antunes  da Silva at JPMorgan Chase &
Co. wrote in a note to investors on July 19.  
 Pretax profit at HSBC’s investment banking unit, led by
 Stuart Gulliver , probably fell 33 percent to $4.24 billion, da
Silva wrote.  
 Credit Suisse Group AG ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Citigroup
Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America
Corp., on average reported a 34 percent drop in trading revenue
in the second quarter from the first, company reports show.  UBS
AG ’s investment bank posted a decline in trading revenue in the
second-quarter, while beating analysts’ estimates. Sales and
trading at the securities unit of  Deutsche Bank AG  fell 15
percent in the three months to June from a year earlier.  
 “Investment banking has for the last two or three months
been poor,” said  Guy de Blonay , who helps manage about 19.5
billion pounds at Jupiter Fund Management Plc in London. “It’s
been a difficult environment and expectations are low, so we’ll
look for a surprise.”  
 ‘No Return’  
 Barclays may say net income rose to 2 billion pounds from
1.89 billion pounds, as provisions for bad debts and credit
markdowns fell, according to the median estimate of nine
analysts in the survey.  
 Barclays Capital, the investment banking division led by
 Robert Diamond , hired 750 people last year to boost equities and
mergers advisory revenue in Europe and Asia. Costs at the
division probably rose 27 percent to 3.9 billion pounds, while
revenue excluding credit markdowns may fall 34 percent to 6.9
billion pounds from a year ago, wrote  Jason Napier , an analyst
at Deutsche Bank AG in London in a note to investors this month.  
 The expansion followed its acquisition of the North
American operations of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Plc  in 2008.  
 “We continue to forecast no return to the exceptional
revenues achieved in 2009, notwithstanding the accelerated
build-out of Barclays Capital’s equities platform in Europe and
Asia,” wrote  Ian Gordon , an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas SA in
a note to investors on July 27.  
 Lower Impairments  
 Standard Chartered , which makes most of its profit in Asia,
will probably report a 13 percent rise in net income to $2.19
billion, on lower impairments at its corporate banking division,
according to the median of five analysts in the Bloomberg News
survey.  
 RBS , Britain’s biggest government-controlled bank, will
narrow its loss to 80 million pounds from a loss of 1.04 billion
pounds a year ago, with the recovery in the economy, wrote
analyst  Mark Phin  at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Ltd. in a note to
investors this month. Bad loan provisions will decline by 2.14
billion pounds to 5.38 billion pounds, according to Phin.  
 In February, RBS Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester 
said the bank is likely to return to profit in 2011.  
 ‘Housing Issue’  
 Lloyds  will probably post a proforma pretax profit of 1
billion pounds, from a loss of about 4 billion pounds, according
to the median of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. In
February, CEO  Eric Daniels  said bad debts at the 41 percent
government-owned bank peaked in 2009, following the acquisition
of HBOS Plc. The bank returned to profitability in the first
quarter and should be profitable for the full year, Daniels said
in April.  
 “The issue for the U.K. domestic banks is the consumer and
housing,” said  Julian Chillingworth , chief investment officer
at Rathbone Brothers Plc, which manages about $21 billion.
“People will be concentrating more on the outlook statements
than the numbers.”  
 HSBC is scheduled to report earnings on Aug. 2, Lloyds and
Standard Chartered on Aug. 4, Barclays on Aug. 5 and RBS on Aug.
6.
