             BT Group Plc , the U.K.’s largest
fixed-line phone company, said first-quarter operating profit
climbed 5.5 percent helped by job cuts.  
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
and costs from job cuts rose to 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2
billion) in the three months ended June 30, from 1.33 billion
pounds a year earlier, BT said in a statement today.  
 “We have made an acceptable start to the year, delivering
improved financial results while investing in the future of  the
business,” Chief Executive Officer  Ian Livingston  said in the
statement.  
 Revenue fell 4.4 percent to 5.01 billion pounds. Livingston
slashed jobs and replaced executives at the global services unit
to combat falling sales amid the economic slowdown. The company
today confirmed its full-year outlook.  
 BT, which has 85 percent of the market for U.K. government
telecommunications services, according to analysts at Collins
Stewart, said last week it was “actively engaged” with the
government on a review of commercial contracts as ministers
aimed to cut costs.  
 Competing telecommunications supplier  Cable & Wireless
Worldwide Plc  has forecast “somewhat slower growth” in full-
year earnings after the government cut back on some investment
programs.  
 BT is offering  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc’s  Sky
Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 at a discount to the wholesale price
as it seeks to attract users to its television service.
