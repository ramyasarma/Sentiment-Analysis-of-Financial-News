             Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) , the
second-largest U.S. maker of generic drugs, beat analysts’
estimates for quarterly revenue and profit after making an
acquisition and adding a heart medicine.  
 The Corona, California-based company today reported
adjusted profit of 85 cents a share in the fourth quarter,
exceeding by 12 cents the average  estimate  of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 22 percent to $785.7
million, Watson said today in a statement. That compares with
$709.7 million in a Bloomberg survey of 14 analysts. The company
stuck to earlier sales and earnings forecasts for this year.  
 Sales were helped by the $1.75 billion acquisition Dec. 2
of closely held Arrow Group, a London-based maker of generic
drugs. Watson won approval in August from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to sell copies of AstraZeneca Plc’s Toprol XL, a
heart treatment. Watson also boosted sales of a generic
potassium medicine that substitutes for KV Pharmaceutical Co.’s
Micro-K. Watson’s copy was approved in June 2008.  
 “This year there will be relatively little competition for
Toprol XL and Micro-K,” said Ken Cacciatore, an analyst with
New York-based Cowen & Co., in a phone interview today. “The
guidance was all in line with what they presented in January.”  
 2010 Forecast  
 Watson reiterated its 2010 sales forecast of $3.5 billion
given Jan. 21. The company forecast adjusted earnings of $3.05
to $3.30 a share for the year, the same as given last month.  
 Watson’s shares fell 38 cents, or almost 1 percent, to
$38.98 at 4 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares have gained 34 percent over 12 months.  
 The company is expecting FDA approval this year of generics
of Cardizem LA, a heart-pain and blood-pressure drug from
Biovail Corp., and 100 milligram and 200 milligram doses of
Toprol XL in addition to the 25 and 50 milligrams approved in
August, Chief Executive Officer Paul M. Bisaro said in January.
The purchase of Arrow adds about 20 products to Watson’s U.S.
generic offerings and expands the company’s business abroad, the
company said at the time.  
 The revenue estimate for the fourth quarter “didn’t have
the partial month of Arrow’s revenue factored in,” Cacciatore
said. “But that makes sense in the greater context of their
guidance for next year.”  
 Net income  for the fourth quarter rose less than 1 percent
to $56.9 million, or 51 cents a share, from $56.4 million, or 50
cents a share, a year earlier.
