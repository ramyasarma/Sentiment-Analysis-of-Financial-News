             Russia , the world's largest oil
producer after  Saudi Arabia , has enough money to survive any
external shock, including a prolonged plunge in the price of
crude, President  Vladimir Putin 's top economic adviser said.  
 Russia can go ``two or three years'' without problems if the
price of oil plunges to $18 a barrel because of its financial
reserves, Arkady Dvorkovich said on the sidelines of a conference,
organized by The Economist, in Moscow today. The  budget  is based
on a price of $27, he said. Russia's benchmark blend of crude,
Urals, is currently trading at about $54.  
 Russian leaders have warned that growth, which has been
bolstered by oil and gas and helped the country pay back billions
of dollars in debt, may slow as energy prices fall. The Economy
Ministry yesterday lowered its prognosis for economic growth this
year to 6.05 percent from 6.2 percent.  
 ``We have sufficient financial reserves to meet any risks,''
Dvorkovich said today. ``There won't be any economic shocks.''  
 Record global energy prices have been a boon to Russia, whose
economy has expanded for the past nine years after it defaulted on
domestic debt, causing the ruble and domestic banks to collapse.
Since then, Russia's foreign-currency reserves have surged to
about $310 billion and its oil fund, a cushion against falling
crude prices, has surged to about $100 billion.  
 The Economy Ministry yesterday cut its forecast for oil
 prices  for 2007 to $55 a barrel from $61. Oil, natural gas and
petrochemicals accounted for 68 percent of Russia's total exports
last year, according to the Federal Customs Service.  
 ``Lower than expected  oil prices  will not have a dramatic
effect on budget performance,'' Deutsche UFG said in a written
note today.
