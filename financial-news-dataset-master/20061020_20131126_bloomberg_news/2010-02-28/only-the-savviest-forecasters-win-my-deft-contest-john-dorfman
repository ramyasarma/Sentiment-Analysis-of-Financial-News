             Very few people foresaw the Great
Recession of 2007-2009.  
 That’s really no surprise. Most economic forecasters fall
on their faces at turning points. For example, in January 2008
only five of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted
a recession. The consensus was that the chance of a recession
developing within 12 months was 40 percent. In fact, it was
already under way.  
 Can you do any better than the experts? One way to find out
is to enter my annual Derby of Economic Forecasting Talent
(DEFT), which I am now reviving after a few years of dormancy.  
 Some of the previous contests were won by financial
professionals, including a Fed official in Richmond, Virginia,
and money managers in Chicago and New Jersey.  
 Other winners were amateurs. For example, the victor one
year was a recent graduate of the University of New Mexico who
hadn’t yet found her first job. (At least she was an economics
student, not an English major.)  
 So far, no economist has taken first place, though quite a
few have entered. The number of entrants per year has ranged
from about 40 to more than 100, including people in all walks of
life from about a dozen countries.  
 Pros and Amateurs  
 Why can amateurs fare as well as they have in the contest?
Experts in almost all fields make mistakes frequently. This is
not because they are inept poseurs, but simply because
forecasting complex systems is incredibly difficult.  
 Researchers have studied cardiologists analyzing
electrocardiograms, racetrack bettors handicapping
thoroughbreds, and meteorologists forecasting storms. Their
studies show it is often difficult even for knowledgeable people
to outperform a simple computer model.  
 The DEFT contest itself provides strong evidence of the
challenges of forecasting. Contestants have often missed the
boat whenever a key aspect of the economy veers from trend. For
example, in 2003-2004 every single contestant underestimated the
rise in the price of oil.  
 Here are the six questions you must answer to enter the
DEFT contest for 2010-2011.  
 Question 1: Economic Growth. U.S. gross domestic product in
the fourth quarter of 2009 was growing at an annualized rate of
5.7 percent. Growth was 2.2 percent in the third quarter, and
had been negative in five of the six previous quarters. What
will be the pace of economic growth in the fourth quarter of
2010?  
 Question 2: Inflation. The U.S. consumer price index rose
2.6 percent in the year ended January 31, 2010. Twelve months
before that it was flat. What will be the comparable figure as
of January 31, 2011?  
 Question 3: Interest rates. The interest rate on  10-year
bonds  issued by the U.S. Treasury stood at 3.58 percent at the
end of January, up from 2.84 percent a year earlier. What rate
of interest will 10-year Treasury bonds pay as of January 31,
2011?  
 Question 4: Oil prices. A barrel of crude  oil  (West Texas
intermediate, spot price) traded for $72.89 at the end of
January, up from $41.68 a year earlier. What will be the price
of a barrel of oil on January 31, 2011?  
 Question 5: Retail sales.  U.S. retail stores  rang up $356
billion in sales in January, compared with $340 billion a year
previously and $376 billion two years earlier. Rounded to the
nearest billion, what will be the monthly total for retail sales
in January 2011?  
 Question 6: Unemployment. The U.S. unemployment number is
crucial in affecting public mood, consumer confidence, political
fortunes and quality of life for many Americans. As of January
31, the official  unemployment rate  was 9.7 percent. The
comparable figures were 7.7 percent in January 2009 and 5
percent in January 2008. What will be the unemployment rate as
of January 31, 2011?  
 To enter, e-mail me at  dorfman1@bloomberg.net , providing
your answers to the six questions above, plus a phone number and
e-mail address to allow me to contact you if you win. If you do
not receive an acknowledgement of your e-mail entry within 72
hours, please re-send it.  
 All entries must be time-stamped by midnight on March 15,
2010.  
 The contestant with the most accurate answer to each
question receives three points. Second place gets two points,
third place one point. While the theoretical maximum is 18
points, a score of four to six points is often enough to win.  
 The winner will receive a trophy from me, plus bragging
rights at home and at work. Good luck.
