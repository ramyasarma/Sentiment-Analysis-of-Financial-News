             The Turkish government approved the
start of geological surveys in the  Black Sea  to prepare for
construction of OAO Gazprom’s South Stream natural-gas pipeline.  
 Turkish President  Abdullah Gul  told his Russian counterpart
 Dmitry Medvedev  in a telephone conversation today that officials
had “taken all decisions necessary to permit geological and
exploratory work” on the project, the Kremlin press service
said in an e- mailed statement.  
 Italy’s  Eni SpA (ENI)  is also a partner in the 900-kilometer
(560-mile) pipeline, scheduled to open at the end of 2015. It is
designed to link  Russia  to the Balkans, where it will split into
northern and southern routes.
