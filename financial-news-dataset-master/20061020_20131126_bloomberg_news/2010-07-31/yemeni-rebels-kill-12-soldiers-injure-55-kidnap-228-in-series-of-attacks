             A Yemeni rebel group killed 12
soldiers, injured 55 and kidnapped 228 in a series of attacks on
their position in the north of the country, the government’s
Supreme Security Committee said in a  statement  today.  
 The attacks follow a two-month siege of army and pro-
government forces’ positions in the Al-Zala’a region by Houthis
rebels, according to the statement on the website of the ruling
General People Congress party.  
 The Houthis, so called because of the family name of their
leaders, began fighting in the northern province of Saada in
2004. The government accuses them of seeking to re-install the
rule of Zaidi Shiite religious leaders that ended in 1962.
