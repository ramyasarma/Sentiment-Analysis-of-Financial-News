             Nexans SA  expects to raise revenue
and profitability in the second half of the year, even as the
company faces uncertainty about production of underwater cables,
 Journal des Finances  reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer  Frederic Vincent .  
 The forecast for improved earnings hinges on the absence of
glitches at Nexans’ high-voltage cable operations in Norway,
where delays could lead to penalties, Vincent was quoted as
saying.
