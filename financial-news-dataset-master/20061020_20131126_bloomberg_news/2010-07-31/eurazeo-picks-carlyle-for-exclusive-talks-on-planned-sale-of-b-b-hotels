             Eurazeo SA , France’s largest
publicly traded private equity firm, said it’s in exclusive
talks to sell B&B Hotels, the budget chain it bought five years
ago, to Carlyle Group.  
 “The transaction is proceeding on the basis of an estimated
enterprise value at the closing period of 485 million euros
($633 million),” Paris-based Eurazeo said in a statement.  
 Eurazeo, which is also an investor in Europe’s largest
hotel group,  Accor SA , bought B&B from Duke Street Capital Ltd.
in 2005 for an undisclosed amount. B&B is France’s third-biggest
budget hotel group, operating 215 hotels in France, Germany and
Italy.  
 The period for exclusive negotiations on B&B “will end
before the end of next week and may be extended if certain
conditions with regard to the financing of the transaction are
fulfilled,” according to the statement.  
 Eurazeo selected Carlyle, the world’s second-largest
private equity firm, as well as London-based Bridgepoint Capital
Ltd. and French companies PAI Partners and LBO France for
management presentations and further due diligence after they
submitted indicative bids, three people who declined to be
identified because the process is private said last month.
