             U.S. stocks  fell this week, trimming
the biggest monthly rally for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in
a year, after economic reports and earnings forecasts from
technology companies disappointed investors.  
 Akamai Technologies Inc.  and Symantec Corp. dragged
 technology  companies in the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities to
a 1.6 percent loss, the most among 10 industries.  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc.  lost 0.9 percent, helping lead declines among
retailers, as economic growth slowed in the second quarter and
confidence among consumers retreated to a five-month low.  DuPont
Co.  rallied 6.1 percent after raising its full-year earnings
forecast amid improving global demand.  
 The  S&P 500  fell 0.1 percent to 1,101.60, limiting its July
advance to 6.9 percent. It was the first monthly gain since
April, following the combined 13 percent retreat in May and
June. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 41.32 points, or
0.4 percent, to 10,465.94.  
 “We’re seeing headwinds from the economy and there’s a
decline in the visibility about future earnings,” said  Lawrence Creatura , a Rochester, New York-based fund manager at Federated
Investors Inc., which oversees $337 billion. “Stocks are
following our expectations for the economy, so the market is yo-
yoing up and down as we get a wave of government stimulus which
then recedes.”  
 Economic Harbinger  
 Stocks surged on July 26 after shipping company  FedEx
Corp. , considered a harbinger for global growth, boosted its
profit forecast. That was followed by three days of losses for
the S&P 500 as consumer confidence slumped more than forecast.  
 The S&P 500 rallied in July after more than 77 percent of
companies in the index exceeded the average analyst profit
estimate since July 12,  data compiled by Bloomberg  show.
Earnings will rise 35 percent for the entire measure this year,
the most since 1988, analyst forecasts show. Following the 2001
recession, income growth never surpassed 20 percent. The Dow has
posted a 0.4 percent gain for the year, reversing a loss of as
much as 7.1 percent on July 2.  
 “We’ve had a nice run,” said  Mark Dow , who helps manage $3
billion at Pharo Management LLC in New York. “Positioning in the
market is very light because guys got shaken out in May and
June. People look out over the horizon and say, ‘I haven’t made
any money. I have to start making money.’”  
 MasterCard Inc., Pfizer Inc. and  Procter & Gamble Co.  are
among 110 companies in the S&P 500  scheduled  to report quarterly
results next week.  
 Faster Websites  
 Technology  stocks declined as companies such as  Akamai
Technologies  reported quarterly results that fell short of
investors’ expectations. Akamai, the largest supplier of
software to make websites and digital media load faster, plunged
15 percent to $38.36 after its profit margin shrank as it added
business from customers like Netflix Inc. at lower prices.  
 Symantec  forecast second-quarter sales and profit that
missed analysts’ estimates, citing weakness in the euro and
“cautiousness” among customers. The world’s largest maker of
computer security software fell 15 percent to $12.97.  
 Chipmakers declined after  LSI Corp.  said third-quarter
sales will be no more than $655 million, compared with the
$694.9 million average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
The maker of chips used in computer disk drives lost 17 percent
to $4.03. Intel Corp., whose chips run more than 80 percent of
the world’s  personal computers , tumbled 5 percent to $20.60 for
the biggest retreat in the Dow.  
 Apple Inc., which makes iPhones and iPads, slipped 1
percent to $257.25.  
 IPad, IPhone  
 “The only product that seems to be in demand is an iPad or
an iPhone, and that’s only for the select few,” said  Tim Hartzell , who manages $300 million as chief investment officer
for Houston-based Sequent Asset Management. “I don’t know
anybody who wants to spend the money on new computers because we
don’t see the additional sales coming through the door to
warrant the expansion.”  
 Oracle Corp. fell 3.5 percent to $23.64 as the federal
government filed a complaint under the False Claims Act against
the company and Oracle America Inc., alleging that it defrauded
the U.S. on a General Services Administration software contract
that was in effect from 1998 to 2006 and involved hundreds of
millions of dollars in sales.  
 Consumer stocks slipped after reports showed confidence
among U.S. consumers declined in July, a sign the lack of jobs
will limit the economy’s recovery, and gross domestic product
growth at a 2.4 percent annual pace, less than forecast.  
 ‘Very Weak Demand’  
 “We were disappointed by the GDP number,” Hartzell said.
“There’s very weak demand in America, a lot have lost their job
or gotten a wage decline, and we just don’t see how the market
stays up without strong aggregate demand.”  
 Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, declined 0.9
percent to $51.19. Colgate-Palmolive Co., the world’s largest
toothpaste maker, sank 5.4 percent to $78.98, the biggest weekly
decline since March 2009, after sales missed analysts’  estimates 
and the company said Venezuela’s currency devaluation would
further cut 2010 profit.  
 DuPont  surged 6.1 percent to $40.67 for the biggest gain in
the Dow. It reported profit that beat analysts’ estimates as the
third-biggest U.S. chemical maker boosted output on rising
demand around the world and across the company’s businesses,
including auto paints and plastics, crop seeds and materials
used to harness solar power.  
 FedEx  rose 4.6 percent to $82.55 after boosting its profit
forecast for the quarter and full year, exceeding analysts’
estimates, on rising demand for international express shipments.
