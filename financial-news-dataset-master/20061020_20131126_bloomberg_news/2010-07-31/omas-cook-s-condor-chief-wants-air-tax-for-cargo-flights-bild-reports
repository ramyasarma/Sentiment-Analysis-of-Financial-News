             Thomas Cook Group Plc , Europe’s
second-largest travel company, wants a planned flight-departure
tax for passengers in Germany to also apply to cargo flights to
ease fees for travelers,  Bild  reported, citing  Ralf Teckentrup ,
head of the company’s German Condor holiday carrier.  
 The German government, which wants to raise an annual 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion) from departing passengers, has no
plans to extend the tax to cargo flights, according to the
newspaper. A cargo tax could lower payments from travellers by
about 300 million euros, Bild said.
