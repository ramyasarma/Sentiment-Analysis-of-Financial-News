             Dutch Central Bank President Nout
Wellink, also chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, says the new capital and liquidity rules for banks
remained “substantial” even after they were softened, NRC
Handelsblad reported, citing an interview with Wellink.    
 As a result of the rules, banks will need to use large
parts of their profits to strengthen capital buffers, in stead
of for paying bonuses or dividend to shareholders, he is quoted
as saying. Some banks may need to sell shares to raise
additional capital, Wellink told NRC.
