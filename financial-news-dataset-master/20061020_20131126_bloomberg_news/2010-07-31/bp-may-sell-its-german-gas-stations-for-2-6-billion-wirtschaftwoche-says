             BP Plc  wants to sell its German gas
station unit Aral to finance expenses related to the Gulf of
Mexico disaster,  Wirtschaftswoche  said, citing unidentified
bankers involved in the sale.  
 Aral, Germany’s biggest chain of gas stations, is valued at
more than 2 billion euros ($2.61 billion) according to the
bankers, the magazine said.  
 Potential buyers include France’s Total SA, Russia’s OAO
Rosneft and the European filling station association Avia
International.
