             Quarterback  Sam Bradford , the No. 1
overall draft selection, agreed to a six-year contract with the
St. Louis Rams that guarantees a National Football League
record $50 million, ESPN reported.  
 The contract calls for $78 million over the six years with
the potential to reach $86 million, ESPN reported without
saying where it got the information.  
 The 22-year-old former University of Oklahoma quarterback
won the Heisman Trophy as a sophomore two years ago, when he
led his team to the national championship game, passed for a
school-record 4,720 yards and threw for 50 touchdowns. He was
limited to three games last season because of a shoulder injury
that required surgery in October.  
 The Rams were 1-15 last season and 6-42 during the past
three seasons.
