             The New York Yankees acquired
outfielder  Austin Kearns  from the Cleveland Indians for a
player to be named or cash, the team said.  
 The Yankees completed the deal last night as the trade
deadline neared. Teams have until 4 p.m. New York time today to
trade players outside Major League Baseball’s waiver system.
Trades can still be made after then, but players must first
pass through waivers, giving other teams the chance to claim
them.  
 Kearns, 30, hit .272 with eight home runs and 42 runs
batted in during 84 games in which he played all three outfield
positions with the Indians this season.  
 Kearns was selected by Cincinnati in the first round of
the 1998 draft. He has a career .258 batting average with 113
home runs and 464 RBI in 926 games over nine seasons with the
Reds, Washington Nationals and Indians.
