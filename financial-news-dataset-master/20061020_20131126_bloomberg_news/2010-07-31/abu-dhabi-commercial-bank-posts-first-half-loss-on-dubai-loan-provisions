             Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC , the
United Arab Emirates’ third-biggest bank by assets, reported a
first-half loss on provisions for non-performing loans to Dubai.  
 The loss of 306 million dirhams ($83.3 million) compares to
a 657 million-dirham profit in the same period a year earlier.
Abu Dhabi Commercial had impairment allowances of 2 billion
dirhams for the first half, according to an e-mailed statement
today, and exposure of 6.6 billion dirhams to Dubai World, the
state-owned holding company seeking to renegotiate terms on
$23.5 billion of debt.  
 “As a result of the current economic environment, both
corporate and consumer segments continue to experience high
levels of stress and therefore we have had to take significant
impairments,” Chief Executive Officer  Ala’a Eraiqat  said in the
statement.  
 Dubai World  said it expects to complete its restructuring
in “coming months” after it met with creditors on July 22.
Dubai and its state-owned companies racked up $109.3 billion of
debt as the emirate transformed itself into a tourism, trade and
financial-services hub to diversify its economy. About $15.5
billion of that is due this year, according to the International
Monetary Fund.  
 Abu Dhabi Commercial reported a loss of 531 million dirhams
for the second quarter, or 9 fils per share. The bank posted net
income of 294.9 million dirhams in the second quarter of last
year, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Dubai is the second-largest member in the seven-member
U.A.E. federation, after Abu Dhabi.
