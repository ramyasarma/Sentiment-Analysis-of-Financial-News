             PTT Exploration & Production Pcl ,
Thailand’s only listed petroleum explorer, said Indonesia plans
to “present a formal written claim” to the company to cover
damages caused by an oil spill in the Timor Sea last year.  
 PTTEP Australasia officials met representatives from the
Indonesian government in Perth, Australia for the first time on
July 27, the Bangkok-based oil company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 Indonesia Transport Minister  Freddy Numberi  said this month
that damage to the nation is estimated at about 500 billion
rupiah ($56 million) and that this figure may rise.  
 PTT Exploration  operated the well from which it estimates
as much as 400 barrels of oil a day leaked into the waters off
Australia’s northwest coast for more than 10 weeks last year.
