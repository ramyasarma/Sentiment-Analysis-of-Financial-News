             Saudi Arabian shares rose, with the
 Tadawul All Share Index  recording the third-biggest monthly gain
in a year, following flat trading in U.S. and European shares.  
 The 143-company gauge rose 0.3 percent to 6283.73, the
highest since June 28, at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh, after
falling as much as 0.2 percent.  Al Rajhi Bank , the biggest
publicly traded lender in Saudi Arabia, was the leading mover,
while  Samba Financial services , the kingdom’s second biggest
lender by market value, drove lagging movers. Tadawul gained 3.1
percent in July, the highest monthly gain since March.  
 “Today’s small uptick is nothing to call home about,”
said  John Sfakianakis , chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi in
Riyadh. “Oil has been hovering in the high $70s and global
equities have been rather flat as the summer lull is taking hold
in Europe and the U.S.”  
 European, U.S. and developing-nation markets declined this
week. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  slipped 0.2 percent, as the  S&P
500  fell 0.1 percent.  
 The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index , which tracks developing-
nation equity markets, declined 0.2 percent yesterday, paring
its monthly gain to 8 percent.  
 Crude for September delivery settled at $78.95 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday. Futures gained 4.4
percent in July and 18 percent in the past year. Saudi Arabia
holds one-fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves.  
 Al Rajhi  rose 0.6 percent to 79.5 riyals, the highest since
June 14.  Samba  declined the most since July 25, losing 1.2
percent to 60 riyals.  Riyad Bank , Saudi Arabia’s third-largest
lender by market value, slid 1.4 percent to 28.6 riyals.  
 Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker, was unchanged at 86.5 riyals.  
 Saudi Electricity Co.  rose 0.7 percent to 14.15 riyals, the
highest since April 2008, after the state-controlled power
producer awarded a 223 million-riyal contract to Mohammed al-
Ojaimi Contracting to link a transformer station in northern
Riyadh with the electric grid.  
 Saudi Investment Bank  rose to the highest since October
2009, gaining 2.2 percent to 20.65 riyals, as the kingdom’s
third-smallest publicly traded bank reduced provisions on bad
loans by 4.2 percent in the second quarter.  
 Saudi Arabia’s index is the only Gulf Arab index tracked by
Bloomberg that trades on Saturday.
