             The New York Yankees acquired first
baseman  Lance Berkman  from the Houston Astros for two minor-
league players, the Major League Baseball team said in a
statement.  
 Berkman also will be used as a designated hitter, the
Yankees said. Houston received right-handed pitcher  Mark Melancon  and infielder Jimmy Parades in return for the five-time
All-Star.  
 The deal was completed before today’s 4 p.m. New York time
deadline for player trades outside baseball’s waiver system.
Trades can be made after then, but players must first pass
through waivers, giving other teams the chance to claim them.  
 Berkman, 34, had spent his entire 11-year major-league
career with Houston, batting .296 with 326 home runs and 1,090
runs batted in. He has a .245 average with 13 homers and 49 RBI
this season.  
 The move comes a day after the Yankees acquired outfielder
 Austin Kearns  from Cleveland.  
 New York has the best record in the majors at 65-37,
leading the Tampa Bay Rays by one game in the American League
Eastern Division heading into their game tonight in Florida.
Houston is fifth in the six-team National League Central
Division.  
 Melancon, 25, was 6-1 with six saves and a 3.67 earned run
average in 40 games in relief at Triple-A at Scranton/Wilkes-
Barre. He’s made 15 appearances for the Yankees over the past
two seasons.  
 Paredes, 21, was batting .282 with 48 RBI and 36 stolen
bases in 99 games at Single-A Charlotte.
