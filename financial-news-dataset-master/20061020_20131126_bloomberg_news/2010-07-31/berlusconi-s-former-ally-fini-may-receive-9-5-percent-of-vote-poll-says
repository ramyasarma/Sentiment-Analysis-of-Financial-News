             Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s former ally  Gianfranco Fini  and his new political
group may have the support of 9.5 percent of voters, according
to a poll by  Crespi Ricerche .  
 That would make it Italy’s fourth-biggest political
grouping after Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party, the center-
left’s Democratic Party and the Northern League, according to
the poll, which was published on the website of Generazione
Italia, a think-tank close to Fini. About 1,000 people were
surveyed and no margin of error was given.  
 Fini, the speaker of Italy’s lower house of parliament,
abandoned the premier’s ruling party yesterday to create a new
political group with enough votes to sink the government.
Thirty-two members of the  lower house  left Berlusconi to join
his rival’s new Future and Freedom for Italy formation. That’s
enough to deprive Berlusconi of a majority in the chamber and
potentially bring down the government should they vote against
the premier.
