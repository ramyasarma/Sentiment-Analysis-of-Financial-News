             New Zealand beat Australia 49-28 in
rugby’s Tri-Nations to seal an eighth straight win over the
Wallabies and extend its championship lead.  
 Mils Muliaina  touched down twice as the top-ranked All
Blacks ran in seven tries to three at Melbourne’s Etihad Stadium.
Australia’s  Drew Mitchell  was sent off in the 43rd minute for a
second yellow card.  
 Richie McCaw ,  Dan Carter , Cory Jane,  Joe Rokocoko  and  Corey Flynn  also scored tries for New Zealand. Mitchell,  Adam Ashley Cooper  and  Rocky Elsom  touched down for Australia.  
 New Zealand’s run of eight straight victories in Trans-
Tasman rugby Tests is the longest in 63 years. The All Blacks
won a record nine games in a row between 1936 and 1947.  
 Today’s victory lifts New Zealand to 15 points at the top
of the standings, 11 ahead of the Wallabies before their meeting
in Christchurch next week. The southern hemisphere’s annual
championship then moves to South Africa for three games.  
 The match doubled up as the first of four Bledisloe Cup
encounters between the Wallabies and All Blacks this year. New
Zealand has held the 79-year-old trophy since 2003.
