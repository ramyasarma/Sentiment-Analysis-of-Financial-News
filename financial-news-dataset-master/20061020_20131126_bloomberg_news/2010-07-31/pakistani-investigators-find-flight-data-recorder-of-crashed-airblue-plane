             Investigators in Pakistan have
found the so-called black box, or flight data recorder, at the
site of a July 28 plane crash that killed 152 people.  
 “The black box has been located and it is in our
custody,” Mubarak Shah, chief spokesman for the country’s
civil aviation authority, said by phone from Islamabad. “The
box contains vital information, like correspondence between the
pilot and the control tower, that will help us evaluate what
went wrong that day.”  
 Airblue flight Ed202, an Airbus SAS A-321 carrying 146
passengers and six crew, crashed into a hilly area of the
capital Islamabad, killing all aboard. Airblue is one of the
two private commercial airlines operating in Pakistan.  
 Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani ordered an inquiry
into the accident.  
 Airblue Chief Executive Officer  Shahid Khaqan Abbasi  said
yesterday that 102 bodies recovered from the site had been
handed over to the victim’s families.  
 Shah said no timeframe for the completion of the
investigation has been issued.  
 “It is impossible to tell right now when we will complete
our investigations,” he said.
