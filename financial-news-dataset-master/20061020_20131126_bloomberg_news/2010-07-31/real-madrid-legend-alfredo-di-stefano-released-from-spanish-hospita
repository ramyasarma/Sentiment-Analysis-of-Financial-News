             Real Madrid soccer legend Alfredo Di
Stefano was released from the hospital after being treated for a
heart condition.  
 The 84-year-old was admitted to Madrid’s Sanitas La
Moraleja Hospital last week with a “cardiorespiratory
deficiency,” Real said in a statement on its website. He will
now join his family on vacation, the club said.  
 Di Stefano is an honorary president of Real Madrid, where
he played from 1953-64. He was the top goal scorer in the
Spanish league five times and helped Real win the first five
European Cup competitions from 1956-60.
