             Credit Suisse Group AG  sees
investment-banking profit margins narrowing because of increased
regulation,  Boersen-Zeitung  said, citing  Martin Korbmacher , the
group’s head of investment banking in Germany and Austria.  
 Profitability will fall by 5 percentage points in the
investment banking business after banks implement the new rules,
according to the newspaper.
