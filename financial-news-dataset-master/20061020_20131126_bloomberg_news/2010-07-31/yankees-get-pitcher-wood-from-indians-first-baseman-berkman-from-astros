             The New York Yankees acquired right-
handed pitcher  Kerry Wood  today after he was taken off the 15-
day disabled list by the Cleveland Indians as the Major League
Baseball trade deadline ended.  
 The Yankees also received cash from the Indians, who will
receive a player to be named or cash. Wood was placed on the
disabled list July 12 with a blister on his right index finger.  
 In the past two days, the Yankees also got first baseman
 Lance Berkman  from the Houston Astros and outfielder  Austin Kearns  from the Indians.  
 The deals were completed before today’s 4 p.m. New York
time deadline for player trades outside baseball’s waiver
system. Trades can be made after then, but players must first
pass through waivers, giving other teams the chance to claim
them.  
 Wood, 33, is 1-4 with eight saves and a 6.30 earned run
average in 23 games this season for the Indians. In nine of his
last 11 appearances, he has struck out 10 and held his opponents
scoreless.  
 Wood was selected by the Chicago Cubs as the fourth overall
pick in the 1995 First-Year Player Draft. He has a career record
of 81-68 with a 3.71 ERA in 357 games during 12 seasons with the
Cubs and Indians.
