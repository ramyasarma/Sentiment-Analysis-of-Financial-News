             European and Italian champion Inter
Milan is preparing to offer Liverpool about 20 million pounds
($31 million) for midfielder Javier Mascherano, the Daily
Express said.  
 Mascherano this week told new manager Roy Hodgson he wants
to leave Liverpool. Inter is managed by former Reds boss Rafael
Benitez.  
 Marco Branca, Inter’s sporting director, will make the
offer in the next few days, the Express said. Hodgson will look
at Standard Liege’s Steven Defour and Juventus’s Christian
Poulsen as possible replacements for Mascherano, the newspaper
said.
