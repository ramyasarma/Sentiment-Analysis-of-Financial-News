             The crash of a  Deutsche Lufthansa AG 
freight aircraft in Riyadh on June 27 occurred when the plane
struck the runway and damaged its landing gear, the  Saudi Press
Agency  reported, citing preliminary investigation results.  
 The aircraft subsequently slid along the runway at King
Khalid International Airport until it stopped in the sand, the
report said. The subsequent fire in the aircraft was caused by
the hard landing, SPA said, citing the director of safety at the
 General Authority of Civil Aviation , Abdul Rahim al-Bukhary.
