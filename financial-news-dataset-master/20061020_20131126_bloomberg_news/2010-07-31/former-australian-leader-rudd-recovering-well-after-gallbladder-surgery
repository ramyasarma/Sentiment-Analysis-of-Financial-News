             Former Australian Prime Minister
 Kevin Rudd  is “recovering well” after an operation to remove
his gallbladder, his wife Therese Rein told reporters today.  
 “We haven’t been advised by the doctor yet” on when he
can leave the hospital, Rein said in televised comments. He will
follow medical advice on when he can resume normal activities,
she added.  
 Rudd, 52, was taken to the Mater Private Hospital in
Brisbane with acute abdominal pain two days ago and underwent
medical tests, according to a statement from his office. He
intends to continue campaigning for the Aug. 21 election next
week, according to the statement.  
 Rudd was ousted by his deputy  Julia Gillard  on June 24 when
Labor Party factions and key labor unions switched allegiance as
his popularity with voters slumped in opinion polls to election-
losing levels.
