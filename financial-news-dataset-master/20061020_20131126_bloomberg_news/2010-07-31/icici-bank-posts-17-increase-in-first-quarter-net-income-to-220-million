             ICICI Bank Ltd. , India’s second-
biggest lender, said first-quarter profit rose 17 percent, as it
cut provisions and increased fee income.  
 Net income  advanced to 10.3 billion rupees ($222 million),
or 9.16 rupees a share, in the three months ended June 30, from
8.78 billion rupees, or 7.87 rupees a share, a year earlier, the
Mumbai-based bank said today.  Profit  matched the 10.3 billion
rupee average of 18 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The second consecutive quarter of profit growth may bolster
Chief Executive Officer  Chanda Kochhar ’s efforts to tap
accelerating credit demand in an economy that is forecast to
 grow  by 8.5 percent in the year to March 31. Still, loans shrank
for the seventh consecutive quarter as Kochhar pared dependence
on unsecured lending such as credit cards and personal loans.  
 “The results were a mixed bag,” said  Clyton Fernandes , an
analyst at Anand Rathi Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai.
“While the profit number was in line with expectations, what is
disappointing is that the bank’s balance sheet hasn’t seen any
growth. Markets could be disappointed with these results.”  
 ICICI , which was the  worst performing stock  last quarter on
the 14-member  Bankex index , fell 2.6 percent to 904.90 rupees in
Mumbai trading yesterday. The shares have added 3.2 percent this
year, trailing the benchmark lenders’ gauge’s 15 percent gain.  
 Loans, Deposits Decline  
 The bank’s  total outstanding loans  dropped to 1.84 trillion
rupees at the end of June, from 1.98 trillion rupees a year
earlier, ICICI said in a statement. Deposits shrank to 2
trillion rupees, from 2.1 trillion rupees.  
 ICICI will increase rates for deposits from today generally
by 25 basis points, with rates on some deposits likely raised by
as much as 75 basis points, Kochhar said on a call with
reporters. The bank will keep reviewing lending rates, she said.  
 Fee income gained 7 percent in the quarter to 14.1 billion
rupees, while net non-performing assets declined 25 percent to
35.1 billion rupees, the bank said. Treasury income, or income
from trading in bonds and currencies, fell to 1.04 billion
rupees, from 7.14 billion rupees.  
 The Reserve Bank of India this week raised interest rates
for the fourth time since mid-March, the most by any central
bank in Asia, to quell the fastest inflation in the Group of 20
nations.  
 The central bank also raised its forecast for economic
growth as strengthening domestic demand trumps concern that the
global economy will slow amid Europe’s debt crisis and elevated
U.S. unemployment. Growth in India’s $1.2 trillion economy may
accelerate to 8.5 percent, faster than the previous estimate of
8 percent, for the year ending March, the bank said.  
 Loan Growth Outlook  
 ICICI expects total loan growth of 15 percent this year and
domestic loan growth of 20 percent, Kochhar said.  
 “It’s going to come from both retail and corporate,” she
said. “We are looking at housing loans, car loans, project
loans and working capital loans.”  
 The bank cut its non-performing asset ratio to 1.62
percent, from 2.19 percent a year earlier. The provisioning
coverage ratio widened to 64.8 percent as of June 30, from 51.1
percent in the year-earlier period. The  Reserve Bank  in October
asked banks to increase the minimum provision ratio for non-
performing assets, or NPAs, to 70 percent from 10 percent by
September 2010. ICICI received an extension until March 2011.  
 ICICI’s net interest income, or the difference between
revenue from loans and interest paid on deposits, was little
changed at 19.9 billion rupees, the bank said.
