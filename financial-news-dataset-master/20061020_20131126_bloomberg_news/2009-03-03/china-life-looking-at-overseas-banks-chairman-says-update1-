             China Life Insurance Co. (2628)  is studying
overseas acquisition targets, including banks, after deciding
not to bid for the Asian unit of  American International Group
Inc. (AIG) , Chairman Yang Chao said today in Beijing.  
 Buying assets in other countries in the current global
financial climate is “risky” although it also brings
opportunities, he told reporters at the annual meeting of the
Chinese legislature’s advisory body.  
 Chinese companies and banks have spent an estimated $100
billion buying up assets in, or making loans to, countries from
Russia to  Venezuela  this year, taking advantage of foreign
rivals’ need to raise money. Aluminum Corp. of China last month
led a spending spree of as much as $25 billion in Australian
commodity producers.  
 “Opportunities and challenges co-exist,” Yang said today.
“As long as the opportunities become ripe, we will go.”  
 China  Life, the nation’s largest insurance company, last
week said it decided not to bid for AIG’s Asian unit.  
 “Their business, asset quality, management team and
reputation changed considerably” since the two companies first
talked, Yang said.
