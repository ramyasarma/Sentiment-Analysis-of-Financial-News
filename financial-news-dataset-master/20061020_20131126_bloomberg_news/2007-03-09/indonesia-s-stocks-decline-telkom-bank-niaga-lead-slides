             Indonesia's key stock index fell for
the first day in four. PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia and PT United
Tractors slipped as some investors judged recent gains
outstripped earnings potential.  
 ``With the market being so volatile, investors were jittery
and locked in profits after a few days of gains,'' said Felix Sindhunata, head of research at PT Mega Capital Indonesia in
Jakarta.  
 PT  Bank Niaga (BNGA)  fell after Citigroup Inc. reduced the stock to
``hold'' from ``buy,'' citing the outlook for slower earnings
growth due to tougher competition for mortgage customers. PT Bank
Mandiri rose after reporting that earnings beat analyst estimates.  
 The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  slipped 6.98, 0.4 percent, to
close at 1764.58. It earlier rose as much as 0.7 percent and fell
0.7 percent. Losing stocks led gainers 87 to 37. The benchmark
ended this week 0.3 percent higher, its first weekly increase in
three.  
 The index rose 4.3 percent over the previous three days,
after falling to a seven-week low on March 5 as disappointing
reports on the  U.S. economy  extended a global selloff in stocks.
The measure's rebound on March 6 was also helped by  Bank
Indonesia 's decision to cut its key  interest rate .  
 Telekomunikasi, the nation's largest telephone company, lost
100 rupiah, or 1.1 percent, to 9,200, snapping a three-day, 3.3
percent advance. United Tractors, Indonesia's largest seller of
heavy equipment, fell 100 rupiah, or 1.4 percent, to 7,150, after
gaining 8.2 percent in the previous three days.  
 PT Bank Internasional Indonesia, Indonesia's sixth-largest
lender by assets, retreated 5 rupiah, or 2.5 percent, to 192. The
stock jumped 8.2 percent over the previous three days on
expectations lower borrowing costs will boost demand for loans.  
 Mandiri Gains  
 Bank Niaga, Indonesia's second-largest mortgage provider,
slid 20 rupiah, or 2.5 percent, to 790, halting a three-day, 11
percent jump. Analysts at Citigroup Inc., Robert Kong and Nawal Nely, yesterday lowered their recommendation on the stock to
``hold'' from ``buy.''  
 ``As a top mortgage player, Niaga may face margin pressure
from lower  mortgage rates , which fell from 15 percent in Sept.
2006 to 12 percent,'' Kong and Nely wrote in a note yesterday.  
 Mandiri, Indonesia's largest lender by assets, jumped 75
rupiah, or 3.2 percent, to 2,425.  
 Mandiri said yesterday  net income  in 2006 quadrupled to 2.42
trillion rupiah ($264 million) from 603.4 billion rupiah on
higher lending and lower loan-loss provisions. That exceeded the
median 2.1 trillion rupiah forecast of six analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 ``Mandiri can book higher earnings this year with lower bad
loans and increases in lending,'' said Bagus Hananto, an analyst
at PT Andalan Artha Advisindo Sekuritas in Jakarta.  
 Elsewhere,  PT Trimegah Securities (TRIM) , Indonesia's second-largest brokerage by value, lost 5 rupiah, or 3.4 percent, to 144.  
 Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.,  Singapore 's third-largest
lender, said its Excel Holdings Pte unit won't pursue a plan to
purchase a 29.5 percent stake in Trimegah. Excel hasn't received
approval from Indonesian authorities, and an agreement to buy the
stake ``has lapsed,'' it said in an e-mailed statement.
