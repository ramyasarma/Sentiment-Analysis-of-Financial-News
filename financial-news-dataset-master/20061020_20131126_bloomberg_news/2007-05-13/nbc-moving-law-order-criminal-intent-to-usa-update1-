             NBC is moving `` Law & Order : Criminal
Intent,'' one of its three  New York  City-based police shows from
producer  Dick Wolf , to sister cable channel USA Network, and is
keeping the original ``Law & Order'' on NBC for an 18th season.  
 The announcement, which NBC and Wolf made in a
teleconference today, comes a day before the major networks
unveil their fall prime-time schedules during a week in
television known as the upfront. Once the networks present their
shows, starting with NBC tomorrow, they begin negotiations with
advertisers over commercial costs.  
 The shift to cable of one of NBC's benchmark shows is the
first indication that NBC, a New York-based unit of  General
Electric Co. (GE) , is turning in a new direction to lift the network
out of fourth place in audience ratings, its position for the
past three years behind ABC, CBS and Fox.  
 ``They must feel very confident in the programs they have in
development,'' said  Brad Adgate , research director for the ad
agency  Horizon Media . ``They are heavily laden with drama so the
network is thinking they can deliver more desirable viewers than
what the `Law and Order' franchise has been doing for the past
few years.''  
 Unusual Twist  
 NBC said it has ordered a full season, 22 episodes, of
``Criminal Intent'' and, in an unusual twist, will run them on
NBC after they premiere on USA, a cable channel that  NBC
Universal  took over in 2004. Until now, only reruns of ``Law &
Order'' shows have appeared on cable, channels that include USA,
Bravo and TNT.  
 ``Our goal was, as a company, to keep all three `Law &
Order' franchises robust,'' said Marc Graboff, president of
NBC's entertainment operations in Burbank,  California . ``We had
to figure out a way to do it. This gives us maximum flexibility
of schedule.''  
 Wolf and NBC have been negotiating for months over the
future of ``Law & Order'' which premiered on Sept. 13, 1990, and
remains one of the longest-running dramas in television history,
and of ``Criminal Intent,'' which began on NBC on Sept. 30,
2001.  
 Production Costs  
 Wolf's other show on NBC, ``Law & Order: Special Victims
Unit,'' which debuted Sept. 20, 1999, has already been renewed
for the 2007-2008 season.  
 The recent round of negotiations largely focused on
production costs, with NBC in the midst of a $750 million cost-cutting effort and Wolf eager to keep all three shows on the
air.  
 Wolf called the solution ``a win-win for everybody'' and
said viewers would see no artistic difference in ``Criminal
Intent'' on USA, either in the look of the show or its cast.  
 He said certain financial concessions were made as a way to
keep all three of his shows on the air. Asked if that meant his
production company would earn smaller profits for moving
``Criminal Intent'' to cable, he said, ``No comment. No comment.
No comment.''  
 By keeping ``Law & Order'' on its broadcast schedule, NBC
is extending its chance to surpass ``Gunsmoke,'' a Western that
aired on CBS from 1955 to 1975, as the longest running TV
program.  
 Changing Habits  
 All three of the Wolf shows have enjoyed strong ratings
over the years, yet like other NBC programs, have lost viewers
as television watching has spread across cable.  
 A fourth police drama from Wolf, ``Law & Order: Trial By
Jury,'' aired for several months on NBC in 2005 before it was
canceled.  
 Overall viewership on  network television  during this prime
time season is 3 percent smaller than last year, according to
 Nielsen Media Research .  
 NBC has been especially hurt by changing habits and tastes.  
 Many of its newer shows in recent years won more applause
from critics than viewers, keeping it behind ABC, CBS and Fox in
the key measures of overall audience and viewers aged 18 to 49,
those who determine the highest advertising rates.  
 In the first week of May, the most recent period for which
Nielsen has complete ratings, ``Law & Order'' was tied with two
others shows as the 33rd most watched of the week. ``SVU'' was
ranked 20th and ``Criminal Intent'' 43rd.  
 With a week left in the current season, NBC is averaging 9
million viewers a night for the season, compared with 12.5
million for  CBS Corp. (CBS) , 10.3 million for  News Corp. (NWSA) 's Fox network
and 9.8 million for ABC, owned by  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)
