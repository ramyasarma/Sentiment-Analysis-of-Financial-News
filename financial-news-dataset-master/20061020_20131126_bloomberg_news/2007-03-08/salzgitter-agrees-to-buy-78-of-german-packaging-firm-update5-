             Salzgitter AG (SZG) ,  Germany 's second-largest steelmaker, agreed to buy 78 percent of the packaging
machine firm Kloeckner-Werke AG, expanding in a business with
less volatile pricing.  
 Kloeckner-Werke, based in Frankfurt, is valued at 641
million euros ($841 million), based on today's share price.
Salzgitter is buying the stake from the insolvent WCM Group and
didn't disclose a price.  
 Salzgitter has been considering acquisitions since November,
when it sold 17 percent of Vallourec SA, gaining 907 million
euros. Salzgitter is betting that Kloeckner-Werke's business of
building machines used to fill bottles generates steadier
earnings than selling steel. European steel prices reached a two-decade low in 2002, before surging to a record in 2005.  
 ``This is a step into a very different business area,'' said
Peter Metzger, an analyst at Hamburg-based M.M. Warburg with a
``buy'' rating on the steelmaker's shares. ``Salzgitter may hope
to improve the quality of management. They have a record of doing
that.''  
 Shares of Salzgitter jumped 3.69 euros, or 3.8 percent, to
101.90 euros. Shares of Kloeckner-Werke rose 2.54 euros, or 22
percent, to 14 euros, the biggest gain since January 2003.  
 Shares WCM Beteiligungs & Grundbesitz AG rose 3.8 cents, or
48 percent, to 11.8 cents in  Frankfurt . The shares fell 85
percent last year. WCM, based in Frankfurt Am Main, filed for
protection from creditors in November after two lenders demanded
early repayment of 230 million euros in loans the previous month.  
 Loan Collateral  
 German lender HSH Nordbank AG ended plans in November to
auction the stake in Kloeckner-Werke, received as collateral for
a loan. The Hamburg-based bank at the time said it would work
with the insolvency administrator to achieve the ``optimal''
valuation for the holding.  
 Kloeckner-Werke had sales of more than 870 million euros
last year, said Salzgitter, named after the German city where it
is based. It has more than 5,000 employees, adding to
Salzgitter's existing 17,000 workers.  
 Kloeckner-Werke aims to increase sales to 1 billion euros
``soon,'' and may itself buy smaller companies, Chief Executive
Officer Roland Flach said today in an interview.  
 Salzgitter said earlier today that fourth-quarter profit
fell after gains from the sale of its shares of Vallourec weren't
repeated. Sales climbed on demand for its girders and pipes.  
 Canadian Talks  
 Fourth-quarter net income dropped to 162 million euros, from
286 million euros a year earlier, spokesman Bernd Gersdorff said
today by telephone. Sales jumped to 2.24 billion euros from 1.77
billion a year earlier.  
 Last month Salzgitter confirmed talks to buy Canadian
competitor Algoma Steel Inc., a company now valued at C$1.55
billion ($1.32 billion).  
 Steel companies are merging to increase their influence over
customers and suppliers and to become more profitable. The metals
and mining industry had more than $157 billion of mergers and
takeovers planned last year, including the $38.3 billion
acquisition of Arcelor SA by Mittal Steel Co.
