             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce , the world's
biggest iron-ore producer, said output this year will rise 14
percent to 300 million metric tons as the company expands mine
operations to meet strong demand from China.  
 Production of iron ore, the main ingredient in steel, may
increase to 320 million tons in 2008, Chief Financial Officer
 Fabio Barbosa  said today in an interview in Rio de Janeiro.
Output rose 13 percent in 2006 to 264 million tons.  
 Chief Executive Officer Roger Agnelli, 47, won a 19 percent
price increase for ore last year and a 9.5 percent gain for 2007
to help fund production growth. Vale is the largest supplier of
iron ore to China, accounting for 23 percent of imports.  
 ``We expect demand from Asia to remain strong,'' Barbosa
told journalists at a news conference. ``China demand is likely
to exceed expectations.''  
 Barbosa said he was not concerned by plans by rivals such
as Cia. Siderurgica Nacional,  MMX Mineracao e Metalicos SA (MMXM3)  and
Bahia Mineracao Ltda. to add more than 100 million metric tons
of Brazilian iron-ore output, more than a third more than Vale
sells to  China  each year.  
 ``You don't just add iron-ore mines from one day to
another,'' Barbosa said. ``Our clients are very satisfied with
our product and our service. I don't see a problem.''
