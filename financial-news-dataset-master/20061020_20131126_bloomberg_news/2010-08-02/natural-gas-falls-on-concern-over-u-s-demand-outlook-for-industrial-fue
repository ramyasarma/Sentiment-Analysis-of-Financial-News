             Natural gas futures fell the most in
three months, snapping a five-day winning streak, after
forecasters cut their estimates for air conditioning demand for
the power-plant fuel.  
 Cooling demand in the U.S. will be 21 percent above normal
today, compared with a July 30 forecast for 24 percent above
normal, according to  David Salmon , a meteorologist with Weather
Derivatives in Belton, Missouri. Demand will be 31 percent above
average tomorrow, compared with last week’s forecast of 34
percent.  
 “It’s still going to be warmer than normal, but not as
warm as people had anticipated,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an
analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. in Houston. “It
gives you reason to take some profits.”  
 Natural gas for September delivery fell 22.2 cents, or 4.5
percent, to settle at $4.701 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the largest decline
since April 29. Gas rose to $5.007 in earlier trading,
surpassing $5 for the first time since June 21.  
 Gas prices have dropped 16 percent this year amid
speculation that inventories will reach near-record highs by the
end of October, as a recovering economy puts little pressure on
a stockpile surplus.  
 “We’re seeing a lower number of cooling degree days in the
near-term forecasts, and the tropical activity doesn’t look as
worrisome,” said  Teri Viswanath , director of commodities
research at Credit Suisse Securities USA in Houston.  
 Weather models predict that a tropical depression that
formed over the Atlantic Ocean will not affect the Gulf of
Mexico, Viswanath said. About 11 percent of U.S. gas production,
or 6 billion cubic feet a day, comes from federal waters in the
Gulf, according to the Energy Department.  
 Manufacturing Growth  
 Manufacturing in the U.S. expanded in July at a slower pace
than in June. The Institute for Supply Management’s factory
index dropped to 55.5 in July from 56.2 a month earlier.
Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  
 “The short-term story is kind of a murky area where we’re
short of enough data,” said  Michael Rose , director of trading
at Angus Jackson Inc. Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “The real thing
that is going to be the catalyst for higher prices is the jobs
number.”  
 The jobless rate rose to 9.6 percent last month from 9.5
percent in June, according to the median estimate of 57
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before a Labor Department
report Aug. 6. A drop in federal census workers as the
population count wound down depressed payrolls by 60,000, the
data may also show.  
 If the jobless rate comes in better than expected it will
fuel optimism that consumer demand is returning, bolstering gas
consumption, Rose said.  
 U.S. Stockpiles  
 The fuel rose 7.5 percent last week after a stockpile
surplus to the five-year average dropped to 8.9 percent from 9.9
percent a week earlier.  
 Supplies  climbed 28 billion cubic feet to 2.919 trillion in
the week ended July 23, according to an Energy Department report
on July 29, less than the median forecast of 32 billion in a
Bloomberg survey of 21 analysts. The increase was also smaller
than the five-year  average  of 50 billion.  
 “It had a banner week last week,” said  Tom Orr , director
of research at Weeden & Co., a brokerage in Greenwich,
Connecticut. “It was up a whole heck of a lot. To some degree,
you’re seeing a resetting back to the median price of last
Friday, which is around $4.85. It’s a fickle market.”  
 Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 13.16 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $4.9427 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  
 Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
244,032 as of 3 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
252,000. Volume was 190,621 on July 30. Open interest was
786,798 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
820,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.
