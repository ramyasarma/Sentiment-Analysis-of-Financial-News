             The  Little League World Series 
expanded its use of video instant replay to make force-outs,
tags on the base paths, missed bases and hit batters eligible
for review.  
 Team managers will now be able to call for video reviews;
only umpires were allowed to ask for them in past seasons,
Little League said in a  news release  posted on its website.  
 The Little League World Series, which is broadcast by  Walt
Disney Co .’s ABC and ESPN networks, began using instant replay
in 2008 to examine plays near the outfield fence such as home
runs, ground-rule doubles and fan interference.  
 Last season, replay was expanded to include whether fair
balls should have been called foul.  
 Managers will be limited to one unsuccessful challenge in
the first six innings of games, and another unsuccessful
challenge in extra innings.  
 The tournament of 11-12-year-olds, which is held in South
Williamsport, Pennsylvania, is entering its 64th year. It runs
from Aug. 20-29.
