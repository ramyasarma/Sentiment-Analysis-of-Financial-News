             Microsoft Corp.,  the world’s biggest
software maker, won a court ruling that its Xbox video-game
system doesn’t infringe a patent over multiplayer gaming, ending
a six-year legal battle.  
 U.S. District Judge  Paul D. Borman  in Detroit on July 20
dismissed the 2004 lawsuit against Microsoft brought by
inventors Peter Hochstein and Jeffrey Tennenbaum along with
Harold Milton Jr., who owns rights to the patent. The men had
been demanding royalties on Xbox sales, plus an order barring
further use of their invention.  
 The patent, issued in 1994, is for a device that lets two
or more people play video games together without being in the
same location, such as over a telephone line. The men claimed
that could be construed to cover all systems that can have
multiple players, like the Xbox.  
 Borman ruled that the patent only covered game systems that
are electrically connected. Such a connection doesn’t include
the type of link among players used by the Xbox, the judge said.  
 The Michigan men also sued Sony Corp., maker of the
PlayStation video-game system. That case was settled. Lawyers
for the men didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.
 Kevin Kutz , a spokesman for Microsoft, said the Redmond,
Washington-based company was pleased with the decision.  
 The case is Hochstein v. Microsoft, 04-73071, U.S. District
Court for the District of Michigan (Detroit).
