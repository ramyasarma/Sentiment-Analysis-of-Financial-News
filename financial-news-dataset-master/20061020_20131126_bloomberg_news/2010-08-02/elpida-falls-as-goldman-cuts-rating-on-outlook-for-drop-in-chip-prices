             Elpida Memory Inc.,  the world’s
third-biggest maker of memory chips, fell the most in a month
in Tokyo trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its
rating on concern semiconductor prices will fall next year.  
 Elpida declined 7.8 percent to close at 1,199 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest drop since June 25. Japan’s
benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 0.4 percent.  
 The market for dynamic random access memory chips will
peak in the fourth quarter,  Ikuo Matsuhashi , a Tokyo-based
analyst at Goldman, wrote in a July 30 report. Matsuhashi
lowered his  rating  on Elpida to “neutral” from “buy,” a
rating he had maintained since January.  
 “It will take at least six to nine months before we can
tell whether Elpida and its peers can avoid losses,” wrote
Matsuhashi.  
 Matsuhashi lowered his 12-month share price estimate on
Elpida, which trails Samsung Electronics Co. and Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. in DRAM production, to 1,600 yen from
2,400 yen.
