             Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, denied a news report that it may
extend a stock offering to all investors and dilute the stakes
of current shareholders.  
 “Petrobras intends to grant shareholders priority,” the
Rio de Janeiro-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  
 Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported yesterday
that banks hired to carry out the planned offering have proposed
letting all Brazilian workers tap an employment-linked savings
fund to buy the company’s stocks.  
 Petrobras has tumbled 22 percent this year, more than the
0.1 percent drop for Brazil’s benchmark  Bovespa  stock index. The
stock rose 76 centavos, or 2.8 percent, to 28.44 reais as of
5:07 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading, the biggest gain since May 31.  
 Petrobras delayed a stock offering to September from June
as a government agency decides the value of as much as 5 billion
barrels of deepwater reserves that the government plans to
exchange for company stock.
