             Adani Enterprises Ltd ., India’s
biggest coal importer, plans to import 400,000 metric tons of
the fuel from South Africa for  ACC Ltd. , the nation’s biggest
cement maker, and two of its rivals, an official said.  
 Adani, based in Ahmedabad, will import the coal by the end
of this year, the official said, asking not to be named because
of company policy. The coal will be sourced as part of orders
for 200,000 tons from ACC and 100,000 tons each from Grasim
Industries Ltd.’s cement unit and Jaypee Cement Ltd., he said.  
 India is increasing imports of coal as it tries to meet
rising demand in an economy that has grown an average 8.4
percent since 2004, straining capacities at roads, ports and
factories. Asia’s third-largest energy user imported 7.6 percent
more of power-station coal from South Africa’s Richards Bay, the
world’s second-largest coal export harbor, in the first half of
2010, according to mjunction Services Ltd., a web-based trader.  
 Export prices at Richards Bay fell 49 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to an average $90.30 a ton in the week to July 23, according to
IHS McCloskey. The data are an average based on daily price
assessments and a market survey.  
 Adani, which owns and operates India’s largest private port
in the western state of Gujarat, can import coal at Mundra and
Dahej.  Adani Power Ltd ., owned by Adani, will buy coal mining
rights in Australia’s Queensland state from Linc Energy Ltd. for
A$1 billion, the Australian said today.  
 Indian thermal coal imports surged last year to a little
less than 60 million tons from about 30 million in 2008,
Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report in March. India plans to
almost double electricity generation capacity by 2012, when the
shortage of coal will exceed 200 million tons.  
 India needs to double the pace of growth in power-station
coal supply to help drive the country’s economic expansion,
Credit Suisse Group AG said in a note on July 8. Supplies should
grow as much as 11 percent from an average of 5 percent to 6
percent earlier to support expansion in gross domestic product
of as much as 10 percent, the bank said.
