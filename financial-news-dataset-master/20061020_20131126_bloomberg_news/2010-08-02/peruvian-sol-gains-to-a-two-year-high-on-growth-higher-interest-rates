             Peru’s sol rose to a two-year high
as the expanding economy and higher interest rates boosted
appetite for the nation’s local assets.  
 The sol rose 0.2 percent to 2.8155 per U.S. dollar at 3:44
p.m. New York time, from 2.82 on July 30. That’s its strongest
level on a closing basis since Aug. 7, 2008.  
 Peru’s central bank bought $95 million in the foreign-
exchange market today to ease gains in the sol. It purchased
$1.86 billion in July, the biggest monthly purchase since March
2008, and also increased reserve requirements to curb rising
demand for the local currency.  
 “Growth remains solid and rates are expected to continue
to rise, making Peru attractive,” said  Bertrand Delgado , a
senior economist at Roubini Global Economics LLC in New York.
“The central bank has been intervening strongly and will likely
continue to do so to protect the dollarized economy.”  
 South America’s sixth-largest economy expanded 9.2 percent
in May from a year earlier, and may post growth of close to 10
percent in June, central bank President  Julio Velarde  said July
22. The statistics agency is scheduled to publish its June gross
domestic product report on Aug. 16.  
 Policy makers will raise the  overnight lending rate  for a
fourth straight month by a quarter percentage point to 2.25
percent when they next meet Aug. 5, according to 13 of 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. One analyst expects Banco
Central de Reserva del Peru to lift the key rate to 2.5 percent.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 was little changed at 5.35 percent,
according to Citigroup Inc.’s local unit.
