             Brazil’s trade  surplus  narrowed in
July after imports jumped more than forecast on economic growth
and a cheap dollar, the Trade Ministry said.  
 The surplus narrowed to $1.36 billion in July, the ministry
said in a report on its website.  Imports  rose to a 21-month high
of $16.3 billion, beating the $16 billion median estimate of 13
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Exports  rose to $17.7 billion,
lower than the $18 billion median forecast of economists.  
 Brazil’s  economic growth  may have slowed to a sustainable
level, helping contain  inflation  risks, the central bank said
last week in the minutes of its July 20-21 meeting. Policy
makers  reduced the pace  of interest rate increases last month,
raising the benchmark rate by a half-point to 10.75 percent,
after increasing it twice by 0.75 point this year.  
 Brazil’s 12-month  current account gap  widened to highest on
record in June as companies increased profit remittances and
spending by Brazilians abroad in 2010 is forecast to reach a
record $8 billion, the central bank said last week.  
 The further deterioration of Brazil’s external accounts
will weaken the country’s real, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega 
said July 27.  
 The real has gained 4.7 percent in six months, the best
performance among the 16 most-traded currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. It has more than doubled since President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  took office in January 2003.  
 In trading today, the real gained 0.4 percent to 1.7477 per
dollar at 10:59 a.m. New York time from 1.7549 on July 30. In
the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on the
contract due in January 2012 was unchanged at 11.46 percent.
