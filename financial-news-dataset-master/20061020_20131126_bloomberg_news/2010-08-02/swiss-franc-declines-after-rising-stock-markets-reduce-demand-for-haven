             The Swiss franc fell against the
euro, snapping a three-day streak of gains, as rising stock
markets reduced demand for haven currencies.  
 The franc also declined versus the dollar as Europe’s Stoxx
Europe 600 Index jumped 1.9 percent. Futures traders more than
halved their bets that the currency will gain against the U.S.
dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed on July 30. The franc fell even as a
report showed Swiss manufacturing  growth  accelerated to the
fastest on record in July.  
 “Data is supportive of a stronger franc, but the risk
appetite in the markets is driving down the currency,” said
 You-Na Park , a currency analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.  
 The franc weakened 0.7 percent to 1.3677 per euro at 10:30
a.m. in Zurich. The currency gained 0.2 percent last week. It
declined 0.5 percent to 1.0463 versus the dollar today.  
 The SVME purchasing managers’ index rose to 66.9 from 65.7
the previous month, Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG said in
an e-mailed statement today. Economists forecast a drop to 65,
according to the median of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  
 The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on an advance in the franc compared with
those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- was 6,216 as of July
27, compared with net longs of 15,113 a week earlier, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.
