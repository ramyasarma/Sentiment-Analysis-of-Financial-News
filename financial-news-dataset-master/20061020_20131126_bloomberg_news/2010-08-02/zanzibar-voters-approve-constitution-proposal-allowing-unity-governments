             Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous African
archipelago in a political union with mainland Tanzania, voted
to change its constitution to allow parties to form power-
sharing governments.  
 Zanzibar residents voted 66 percent in favor of the
proposal in a referendum July 31, Khatib Mwinyi, chairman of the
Zanzibar Electoral Commission, said in a faxed statement
yesterday.  
 Clashes followed the islands’ last two elections in 2005
and 2000, after the opposition Civic United Front, led by  Seif Sharif Hamad , accused Zanzibar’s President  Amani Abeid Karume 
and his Chama Cha Mapinduzi party of vote-rigging. The parties
tried to negotiate a power-sharing deal to avoid conflict at the
next presidential and legislative elections, set for Oct. 31.  
 “Wisdom prevailed and pushed the two sides to seek a
referendum,” Tanzanian President  Jakaya Kikwete  said in a
national radio address on July 31, according to an e-mailed copy
of the speech.  
 The agreement should increase confidence that Zanzibar is a
politically stable investment destination and boost economic
growth, Civic United Front’s director of foreign affairs, Jussa
Ismail Jussa, said by phone from Zanzibar on July 31.  
 “It’s a milestone for the isles that marks a start of true
economic reforms with the support of both CUF and CCM,” Jussa
said.
