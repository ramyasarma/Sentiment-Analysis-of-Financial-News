             Kuwait Investment Authority, the
country’s sovereign wealth fund, did not receive any offer from
BP Plc to increase its stake in the company.  
 The wealth fund was commenting in an e-mailed statement on
a report in Al-Anba newspaper that BP’s outgoing Chief Executive
Officer Tony Hayward asked Kuwait Investment Authority to raise
its stake to 3 percent to protect the company against any
takeover attempts.
