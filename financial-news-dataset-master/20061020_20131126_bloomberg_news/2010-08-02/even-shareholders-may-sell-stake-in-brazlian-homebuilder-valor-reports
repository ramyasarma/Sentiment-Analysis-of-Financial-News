             Even Construtora e Incorporadora SA ’s
shareholders Terepins family and Spinnaker fund are seeking to
sell their stakes in the Brazilian homebuilder, Valor Economico
newspaper reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  
 The partners are in advanced talks with potential buyers,
including Brookfield Incorporacoes SA and Gafisa SA, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said. Banco Itau BBA is helping the
shareholders in the transaction, Valor said.  
 Members of the Terepins family hold 11 percent of the
company’s shares, while Spinnaker has a 21 percent stake, Valor
said.  
 Even denied the sale, said a spokeswoman, who can’t be
named because of internal rules.
