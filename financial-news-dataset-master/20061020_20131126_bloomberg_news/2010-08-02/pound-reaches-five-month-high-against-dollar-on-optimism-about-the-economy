             The pound rose above $1.58 for the
first time in more than five months as a report showed U.K.
manufacturing expanded more quickly than forecast in July.  
 The British currency climbed as much as 0.7 percent to
$1.5802 before trading at $1.5796 as of 9:32 a.m. in London.  
 An index of U.K. manufacturing fell to a five-month low of
57.3 in July from 57.6 in June, the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply and Markit Economics said in a statement
in London today.  
 Economists forecast a reading of 57, according to the
median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
