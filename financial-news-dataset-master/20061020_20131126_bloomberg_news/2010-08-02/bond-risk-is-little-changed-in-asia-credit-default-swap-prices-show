             The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
bonds from non-payment was little changed, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 117.5
basis points as of 8:49 a.m. in Tokyo, Morgan Stanley prices
show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was also little changed at 119 basis
points as of 8:25 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
