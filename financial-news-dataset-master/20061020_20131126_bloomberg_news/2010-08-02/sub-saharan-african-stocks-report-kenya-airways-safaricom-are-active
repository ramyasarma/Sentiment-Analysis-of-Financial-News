 The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  
 Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI GN), a Togo-based lender
with operations in 29 African countries, fell in Accra and Lagos
after saying first-half profit declined 7.8 percent to 10.6
billion naira ($71 million).  
 The stock dropped 1 pesewa, or 6.7 percent, to 14 pesewas
in Accra. Shares that trade in  Lagos  retreated 65 kobo, or 3.8
percent, to 16.35 naira, the biggest decline since July 12.  
 Kenya Airways Ltd.  (KNAL KN), sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest carrier, gained 3.8 shillings, or 8 percent, the biggest
increase since March 15, to 50.5 shillings. Kenya received
71,077 visitors in June compared to 67,817 in May, the statistic

 Produce Buying Co. Ltd.  (PBC GN), Ghana’s biggest purchaser
of cocoa beans from farmers, rallied 1 pesewa, or 7.7 percent,
to 14 pesewas, the first increase in eight days.  
 Profit for the nine months through June nearly tripled to
9.9 million cedis ($6.9 million) from 3.5 million cedis a year

Graphic newspaper July 30.  
 Safaricom Ltd.  (SAFCOM KN), Kenya’s biggest company by
market value, climbed 10 cents, or 1.7 percent, to 5.95

country in an Aug. 4 referendum.

company,” Judd Murigi, head of research at Nairobi-based CFC
Stanbic Financial Services Ltd., said in a phone interview.
“Market sentiment is improving ahead of the referendum.”
