             Egypt’s planned 750-megawatt power
plant at Sidi Kerir, in the north of the country, will cost 4
billion Egyptian pounds ($703 million),  Al Mal  reported, without
saying how it obtained the information.  
 Part of the cost will be covered by loans from foreign
institutions and the electricity industry will pay for the rest,
the newspaper said.
