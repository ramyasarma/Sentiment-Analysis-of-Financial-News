             Analysts covering Brazil’s economy
cut their year-end interest rate forecast for a second straight
week, after the central bank said inflation risks had been
reduced.  
 The benchmark rate will be raised to 11.50 percent by year
end from the current 10.75 percent, down from a week earlier
forecast of 11.75 percent, according to the median estimate in a
July 30 central bank  survey  of about 100 economists published
today.  
 Policy makers, after raising the  overnight rate  by a less-
than-expected half-point last month, said in the minutes of
their July 20-21 meeting that growth may have slowed to
sustainable levels, helping to contain inflation. The central
bank’s rate decision and comments led traders to trim yields on
the interest rate future contract due in January, which fell 21
basis points since July 21 to 10.76 percent on July 30.  
 Analysts expect consumer price inflation to quicken to 4.97
percent in the next 12 months, up from a week-earlier forecast
of 4.93 percent, according to the median forecast in the bank’s
weekly  survey .
