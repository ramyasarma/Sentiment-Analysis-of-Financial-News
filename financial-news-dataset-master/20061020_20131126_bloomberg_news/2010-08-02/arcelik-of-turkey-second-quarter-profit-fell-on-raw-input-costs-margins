             Arcelik AS , Turkey’s biggest maker of
fridges and washing machines, said second-quarter profit
declined 21 percent as margins narrowed and raw material costs
climbed.  
 Net income decreased to 160.8 million liras ($107 million)
from 204.2 million liras in the second quarter of last year,
according to a  filing  with the Istanbul Stock Exchange today.
Arcelik was expected to earn 146.1 million liras, according to
the  average estimate  of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Adjusted earnings per share were 0.19 liras compared with an
estimate of 0.23 liras.  
 “Operational profitability came out low,” said  Cemal Demirtas , an analyst at Oyak Securities in Istanbul. “Margins
were stronger last year because of the lower steel prices.”  
 Arcelik fell 5 kurus, or 0.7 percent, to 7.40 liras at 5:07
p.m., reversing earlier gains and falling for the first day in
five. The main  ISE National 100  index rose 1.1 percent.  
 Sales increased 0.7 percent to 1.77 billion liras in the
three months to June, lagging an increase in the cost of sales,
which gained an annual 7.8 percent to 1.25 billion liras, the
company said in the statement.  
 Arcelik also benefited last year from tax cuts on home
appliances made between March and September. The company’s owner
merged television unit Grundig Elektronik AS into Arcelik during
2009, helping to cut costs.  
 Arcelik is owned by  Koc Holding AS , Turkey’s biggest group
of industrial and financial companies. Koc rose 1.7 percent to
6.05 liras.
