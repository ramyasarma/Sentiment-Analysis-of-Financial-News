             Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said a decline in government borrowing costs reflects
relative confidence in the country’s debt.  
 Low yields reflect “trust in Japanese bonds and also a
flight to quality,” Noda said at a news conference in Tokyo
today.  
 The  yield  on Japan’s 10-year bond rose one basis point to
1.06 percent at 9:25 a.m. in Tokyo, after touching a seven-year
low of 1.04 percent during trading yesterday.
