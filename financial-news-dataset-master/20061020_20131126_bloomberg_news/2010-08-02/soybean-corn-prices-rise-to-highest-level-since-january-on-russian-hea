             Soybean and corn prices jumped to the
highest level since January as drought slashed grain production
in Russia and parts of Europe, boosting demand for supplies from
the U.S., the world’s biggest producer and exporter.  
 Russia declared emergencies in 27 crop-producing regions as
drought harmed crops across at least 10.3 million hectares (25.5
million acres). Global equity markets rose following better-
than-forecast earnings reports, and raw materials climbed, led
by wheat and energy.  
 “Corn and soybeans are rising on Russian crop concerns,”
said  Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness for Archer
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. “The rally in crude oil and
stocks and the dollar’s decline caused a rush of new investment
money to flow into the grain markets.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 12.25 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $10.1725 a bushel at 10:20 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $10.295, the highest
level for a most-active contract since Jan. 11. In July, the
oilseed jumped 11 percent, the most since May 2009.  
 Corn futures for December delivery gained 6 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $4.1275 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached $4.18,
the highest level since Jan. 12. In July, the price advanced 8.9
percent, the most since February.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.
