             The potential impact of natural
disasters on China’s grain supply may be a problem for the
nation’s economy, the China Daily reported today, citing Zhao
Xiaoyu, vice president of the Asian Development Bank.  
 If the grain supply “does not suffer much,” it won’t
cause high inflation and China’s economy won’t have “major
problems,” the newspaper cited Zhao as saying.  
 The nation experienced drought and low temperatures at the
start of this year, followed by widespread flooding in the
summer, the newspaper reported. The output of grain harvested
this summer fell for the first time in seven years, according to
the report.
