             Job advertisements for lap dancers
and strippers will be banned from the U.K.’s government-funded
employment agencies, Employment Minister  Chris Grayling  said.  
 “Jobcentre Plus will no longer advertise jobs that involve
the direct sexual stimulation of others because publicly funded
services should not be a conduit to this work,” the  Department
for Work and Pensions  said in a statement on its website today.
“The ban would cover such jobs as lap dancers, webcam
performers, and strippers.”  
 Government policy was to refuse advertisements for all
adult-entertainment industry vacancies, until 2003, when Ann
Summers Ltd., which markets and distributes adult toys and
women’s lingerie, successfully argued in the High Court that the
blanket ban was unlawful. Other jobs in the industry, such as
retail, manufacturing and distribution, or cleaning in a lap
dancing club, may still be advertised, the department said.  
 “It’s absolutely wrong that the government advertises jobs
that could support the exploitation of people,” Grayling said.
“We shouldn’t put vulnerable people in an environment where
they’re exposed to these types of jobs and could feel under
pressure to work in the sex industry.”  
 A consultation “revealed significant public concern”
about the display of such advertisements and suggested that
vulnerable people could be open to abuse and exploitation, the
department said.
