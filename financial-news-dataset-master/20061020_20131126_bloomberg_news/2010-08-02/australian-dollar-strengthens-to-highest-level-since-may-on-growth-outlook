             The Australian dollar advanced to its
highest level against the greenback in almost three months as
evidence economic growth remains resilient boosted demand for
higher-yielding assets.  
 The currency gained against most of its 16 major
counterparts before tomorrow’s central bank decision as reports
showed manufacturing expanded in Australia and China. New
Zealand’s dollar rose versus its U.S. counterpart as a rally in
stocks and commodities spurred risk appetite.  
 “We feel pretty positive about the outlook in Asia,
particularly in China,” said  Katie Dean , a senior economist at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne. “The
Aussie and kiwi will be supported.”  
 Australia’s currency rose 1 percent to 91.31 U.S. cents at
12:14 p.m. in New York, from 90.42 cents last week, after
climbing to 91.46, the highest level since May 4. New Zealand’s
dollar gained 1.1 percent to 73.38 U.S. cents, from 72.60.  
 The performance of manufacturing index in Australia rose
1.5 points to 54.4, the Australian Industry Group and
PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a survey released in Canberra
today. A figure above 50 shows the industry is expanding.  
 The Reserve Bank of Australia is forecast to keep the
benchmark cash rate, now at 4.5 percent, unchanged for a third
month when it meets tomorrow, according to all 23 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Australia’s retail sales increased 0.4 percent in June
after rising 0.2 percent in the previous month, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey before a Bureau of
Statistics report tomorrow.  
 China Purchasing  
 China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 51.2 in July,
compared with 52.1 in the previous month, the Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said yesterday. Readings above 50 show
expansion.  
 While China’s expansion may continue to moderate from
a peak in the first quarter, the full-year growth rate may be as
high as 9.5 percent, up from 9.1 percent in 2009, the State
Council researcher  Zhang Liqun  said yesterday.  
 China is Australia’s largest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-biggest export market.
