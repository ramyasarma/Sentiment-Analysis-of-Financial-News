             Gold futures rose to a one-week high
on speculation that a growing global economy will boost demand
for raw materials.  
 Equities in Asia, Europe and the U.S. advanced, and the
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities headed for the
biggest four-session rally in almost a year. Before today, gold
futures dropped 6.5 percent from a record $1,266.50 an ounce on
June 21.  
 “Gold is inching its way back up,” said  Frank McGhee , the
head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago.
“There’s talk of growth again, and gold is playing catch-up to
the industrial complex.”  
 Gold futures for December delivery gained $1.50, or 0.1
percent, to settle at $1,185.40 at 1:35 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the metal reached $1,193.90, the highest level
for a most-active contract since July 26. The price has gained
8.1 percent this year.  
 The MSCI World Index of  equities  jumped to the highest
level since May 13. Crude oil topped $81 a barrel, and copper
rose to a three-month high.  
 Hedge funds and other large  speculators  increased their
net-long position by 5.9 percent in Comex gold futures in the
week ended July 27, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. That marked the first increase in a month.  
 Demand increased in India, the biggest world’s biggest
importer, after prices dropped 5 percent in June.  
 “Metal continues to flow toward countries such as India
and Turkey in anticipation of a rise in seasonal demand,”
 Walter de Wet , the head of commodities research at Standard Bank
Plc in London, said in a report.  
 Euro Gains  
 Gold’s gains were limited because some investors sold the
metal and purchased euros. The currency rose as much as 1.1
percent against the dollar.  
 Gold priced in euros reached a record in early June amid
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  
 “On the rallies, you’ve got some investors moving out of
gold and back into euros,” McGhee of Integrated Brokerage
Services said.  
 Silver futures for September delivery rose 41.6 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $18.419 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery gained $25.40, or 1.6
percent, to $1,602.20 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery advanced $15.85,
or 3.2 percent, to $515.85 an ounce.
