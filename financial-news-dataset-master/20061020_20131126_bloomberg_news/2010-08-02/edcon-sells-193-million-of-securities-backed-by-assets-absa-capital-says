             Edcon (Pty) Ltd., the South African
retailer owned by Bain Capital LLC, sold 1.4 billion rand
($196.7 million) of asset-backed securities to refinance
existing debt, said Absa Capital, which helped arrange the sale.  
 The clothing and linen retailer sold almost three times the
500 million rand it had originally planned to 14 investors,
Barclays Plc-owned Absa said in an e-mailed statement.
Johannesburg-based Edcon’s bonds are backed by the company’s
store-card debt and will be listed on the  JSE Ltd. , which runs
South Africa’s exchanges, the statement said.  
 “Edcon’s main purpose for the sale was to refinance
existing debt and lengthen their maturity profile,” Prasanna
Nana, head of South African debt capital markets at Barclays
Plc-owned Absa, said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg.
“There’s still good demand for securitized paper in South
Africa which still has good, solid structures.”  
 The sale included 968 million rand of notes due April 30,
2013 that were priced to yield 215 basis points more than the
three-month  Johannesburg Inter-Bank Agreed Rate , which traded at
6.585 percent as of 1:18 p.m. local time, said Nana.  
 Edcon also sold 182 million rand of bonds maturing April
30, 2014 at 225 basis points above the so-called 3-month Jibar
rate as well as 250 million rand of notes due April 30, 2017
offering a fixed coupon of 10.09 percent, she said. The fixed-
coupon notes were priced to yield 250 basis points more than the
3-month Jibar rate at the time of sale, said Nana.  
 Today’s sale by Edcon was the biggest publicly listed issue
of securitized debt in South Africa “in two and a half years,”
and follows a 750 million-rand debt placement in March, Absa
said in the e-mailed statement.
