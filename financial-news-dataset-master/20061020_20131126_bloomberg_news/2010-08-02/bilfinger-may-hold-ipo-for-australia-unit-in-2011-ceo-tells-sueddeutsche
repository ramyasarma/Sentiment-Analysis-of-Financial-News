             Bilfinger Berger AG may hold an
initial public offering for its Australian unit early next year,
Sueddeutsche Zeitung cited Chief Executive Officer Herbert
Bodner as saying in an interview.  
 The construction company is still looking for potential
acquisitions to grow its services business and could use the
funds from a share sale to help finance such a purchase, Bodner
told the German newspaper.
