             Suez Environnement and GDF Suez SA
said they “welcome” a July 30 decision by the World Bank
arbitration organization ICSID of Argentina’s liability for
ending water and waste concessions.  
 In an e-mailed statement, the French utilities said the
ruling will be followed “in the coming months” on another for
compensation.
