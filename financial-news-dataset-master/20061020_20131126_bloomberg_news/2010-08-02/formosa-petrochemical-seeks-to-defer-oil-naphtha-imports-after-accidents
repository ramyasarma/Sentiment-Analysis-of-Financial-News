             Formosa Petrochemical Corp. , Taiwan’s
only publicly traded oil refiner, wants to defer some imports of
naphtha and sour, or high-sulfur, crude after two accidents at
its Mailiao plants last month.  
 “Our storage tanks are full,” spokesman  Lin Keh-yen  said
by telephone in Taipei today, declining to give details.  
 Formosa plans to restart a second crude processing unit at
Mailiao this week, after production at the first unit resumed
last week, Lin said.  
 The refiner had shut its 540,000 barrel-a-day Mailiao plant
for safety reasons after an oil leak triggered a blaze at its No.
2 residual desulfurization unit on July 25. Formosa halted its
No. 1 ethylene plant, which has an annual capacity of 700,000
metric tons, on July 7 after a fire.  
 The company had begun the restart process of part of the
refinery, Lin said July 29. Two-thirds of the refining capacity
may be fully operational in one to two weeks, he said.  
 Formosa Petrochemical  shares  climbed 1.3 percent to close
at NT$75.40 in Taipei trading as of 1:30 p.m. local time. The
benchmark Taiex index of equities rose 2 percent.  
 The refinery has three crude distillation units, each able
to process 180,000 barrels a day by heating oil and separating
it into products. Residual desulfurization units remove sulfur.  
 The refiner operates three ethylene  plants  with a combined
annual capacity of 2.935 million tons.
