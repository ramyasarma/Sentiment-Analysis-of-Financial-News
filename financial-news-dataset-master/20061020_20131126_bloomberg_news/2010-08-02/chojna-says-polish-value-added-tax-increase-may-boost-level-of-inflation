             Poland’s inflation will accelerate if
the government goes ahead with plans to increase the value-added
tax rate by one percentage point, Elzbieta Chojna-Duch of the
central bank’s Monetary Policy Council said in an interview on
TVN CNBC Biznes television.  
 Chojna-Duch said the government’s fiscal strategy will have
a “significant” influence on interest-rate decisions.
