             A  gauge  of Australia’s annual
inflation dropped below the top of the central bank’s target
range in July, increasing Governor  Glenn Stevens ’ scope to keep
borrowing costs unchanged for a third month tomorrow.  
 Consumer prices advanced 2.8 percent from a year earlier,
after gaining 3.6 percent in June, according to an index
compiled by TD Securities Ltd. and the Melbourne Institute
released in Sydney today. Prices increased 0.1 percent from a
month earlier, the smallest gain in five months.  
 Slower inflation follows a report last week that showed
consumer prices rose the least in three years last quarter. The
Reserve Bank of Australia will keep its  benchmark lending rate 
at 4.5 percent tomorrow, according to all 23 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. Policy makers aim to keep inflation between 2
percent and 3 percent.  
 “This softer July report is a welcome relief after the
relentless price increases for the last nine months,” said
 Annette Beacher , senior strategist at TD Securities in Singapore.
Weaker inflation “allows the RBA to remain on hold for several
months as mortgage lending rates have already been restored to
‘average’ levels,” she said.  
 Consumer prices rose 3.1 percent in the second quarter from
a year earlier, a report by the Bureau of Statistics showed July
28.  
 The Melbourne Institute is a research unit of Melbourne
University and TD Securities is a division of Toronto-Dominion
Bank, one of Canada’s largest lenders. The monthly inflation
index measures the prices of 1,000 goods and services.
