             The yen fell against most of its
major counterparts while the dollar and Swiss franc weakened as
signs the global recovery is gaining momentum damped demand for
assets perceived to have the lowest risk.  
 Japan’s currency dropped for the first time in four days
versus the euro as stocks rose after Australia’s  manufacturing 
expanded for a seventh month and Britain’s factory growth slowed
less than forecast. The dollar fell toward a three-month low
versus the euro before a report forecast to show U.S.
manufacturing expanded in July at a slower pace.  
 “There is a bit of a relief rally in risk,” said  Adam Cole , head of global foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of
Canada in London. “The uncertainty of the global economy has
pushed us back into the world of one trade, where currencies are
trading as risk proxies.”  
 The yen weakened 0.4 percent to 113.46 per euro at 7:24
a.m. in New York, from 112.84 on July 30. Japan’s currency
declined 0.3 percent to 86.75 per dollar, from 86.47. The dollar
slid 0.2 percent to $1.3076 per euro, from $1.3052, after
reaching $1.3107 on July 29, the weakest level since May 4.  
 The pound rallied as much as 0.8 percent to $1.5819, the
highest level since Feb. 4, as a report showed the U.K.’s
manufacturing growth slowed in July less than economists
forecast in a sign the nation’s economy is still expanding.  
 Britain’s Manufacturing  
 A gauge based on a survey of companies by Markit Economics
and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply was at
57.3, compared with 57.6 in June, London-based Markit said in an
e-mailed statement today. The median estimate of 26 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a reading of 57. A reading
above 50 indicates expansion.  
 Australia’s dollar advanced 1.2 percent to 79.08 yen after
the Australian Industry Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers said an
index of manufacturing rose 1.5 points to 54.4 in July. A figure
above 50 shows the industry is expanding. New Zealand’s dollar
gained 1.2 percent to 63.53 yen.  
 China’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  was at 51.2 in July,
compared with 52.1 in June, the Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said yesterday. Readings above 50 show expansion.  
 “We feel pretty positive about the outlook in Asia,
particularly in China,” said  Katie Dean , a senior economist in
Melbourne at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “The
Aussie and kiwi will be supported.”  
 The MSCI  Asia Pacific  Index of shares rose 1.1 percent, and
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index of equities advanced 2 percent,
boosted by a pre-tax profit that almost doubled for HSBC
Holdings Plc and a 31 percent gain in net earnings for BNP
Paribas SA.  
 Yen in 2010  
 The yen has appreciated versus all of its major
counterparts this year as speculation the global recovery will
falter stoked demand for the safest assets. The yen appreciated
to 85.95 on July 30, its strongest level versus the dollar since
Nov. 30, on concern U.S. growth is slowing.  
 The  Dollar Index , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, decreased for a fourth straight day on
speculation the recovery in the world’s largest economy is
lagging behind other regions. The index dropped 0.1 percent to
81.422 after reaching 81.354, the lowest level since April 27.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing gauge
in the U.S. fell to 54 in July from 56.2 in the previous month,
according to the median forecast of 62 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The report is due at 10 a.m. New York time.  
 Slower U.S. Growth  
 Economic growth in the U.S. slowed to a 2.4 percent annual
rate in the second quarter from a revised 3.7 percent pace in
the first three months of the year, the Commerce Department
reported July 30.  
 The franc weakened after figures from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed futures traders
reduced bets the currency would gain against the dollar last
week. The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on an advance in the franc compared with
those on a drop was 6,216 on July 27, compared with net longs of
15,113 a week earlier.  
 The Swiss currency declined 0.3 percent to 1.0447 per
dollar and weakened 0.5 percent to 1.3652 per euro.  
 FX Concepts LLC, the hedge fund that bought the euro in
June just as it began a 9.7 percent surge against the dollar,
says it’s almost time to get out of Europe’s common currency.  
 The firm, which manages $8 billion in assets, expects the
euro’s advance from a four-year low on June 7 to come undone by
September, partly because European austerity programs will start
to weigh on growth.  
 “Austerity is really bad for growth,” said  Jonathan Clark , vice chairman at New York-based FX Concepts, the world’s
biggest  currency hedge fund . “In the U.S., austerity is mainly
on the state level, but in Europe they are whole-hog into
cutting spending to reduce deficits. Under a pessimistic
scenario, the European currencies are in a lot of trouble.”
