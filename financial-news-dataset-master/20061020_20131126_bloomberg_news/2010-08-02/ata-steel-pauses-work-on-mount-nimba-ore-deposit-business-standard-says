             India’s Tata Steel Ltd. has halted
work on the Mount Nimba iron-ore deposit in west Africa, pending
an environmental report from a United Nations agency, Business
Standard reported, citing a Tata official.  
 The deposit is spread over Ivory Coast, Liberia and Guinea,
the newspaper said.
