             Japan won’t expand an income support
program to farmers of livestock, dairy, fruit and most
vegetables because of budget constraints, Nikkei English News
reported, without citing anyone.  
 The Agriculture Ministry will request about 800 billion yen
in funding for the support program for fiscal 2011, less than
the 1.4 trillion yen the ruling Democratic Party of Japan had
said it would spend, the report said.
