             Chechen rebel leader  Doku Umarov , who
claimed responsibility for a March terrorist attack on the
Moscow metro, may have stepped down as head of the self-styled
Caucasus Emirate, the  British Broadcasting Corp.  reported.  
 A man appearing to be Umarov said in a video that he’s
handing over power to fellow rebel Aslambek Vadalov, the BBC
said on its website. Umarov, 46, said Vadalov could lead “more
energetically,” the broadcaster reported.  
 Both the Russian government and the U.S. State Department
consider Umarov a terrorist, the BBC said. Umarov claimed
responsibility for dual suicide bombings in Moscow subway
stations that killed 40 people and a November attack on the
Nevsky Express train that took 26 lives.
