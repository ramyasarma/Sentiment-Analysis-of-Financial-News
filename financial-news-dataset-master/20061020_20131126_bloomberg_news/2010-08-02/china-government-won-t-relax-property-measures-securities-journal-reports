             China won’t relax property measures
until they have effectively controlled home prices, the China
Securities Journal reported today, citing Wang Juelin, deputy
director of the policy research center at the Ministry of
Housing and Urban-Rural Development.  
 Most cities have been slow in issuing policies to rein in
local property markets, the newspaper reported, citing Wang.
China also needs to increase the supply of homes, Wang was cited
as saying.  
 The government needs to maintain the stability of policies
to reduce expectations that efforts to rein in the property
market will be relaxed in the second half, the newspaper
reported, citing Wang. Many individuals are refraining from
buying now as they expect policies to be relaxed in the second
half, Wang was cited as saying.
