             Rural Electrification Corp. , India’s
state-owned lender to power projects, may sell as much as $300
million of  bonds  denominated in U.S. dollars, Finance Director
 Hari Das Khunteta  said.  
 The company, based in New Delhi, still hasn’t decided on
the price or the tenor of the debt, he said in a telephone
interview, adding the size of the sale may be between $250
million and $300 million.  
 Shareholders raised the company’s borrowing limit to $1
billion for the year ending March 31, according to Khunteta.
Rural Electrification plans to raise $500 million from debt
sales in the period, he had said on April 16.  
 Rural Electrification is raising finance to step up lending
as India plans to double spending on utilities, roads and ports
to $1 trillion in the five years ending 2017 to upgrade the
nation’s infrastructure. Shares of the company rose 3.7 percent
to 314.35 rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange, extending this
year’s gains to 31 percent.  
 India’s utilities added 1,015 megawatts of capacity last
month, short of the planned 2,750 megawatts, the Central
Electricity Authority said in a  report  on its website on July 30.  
 Separately, Rural Electrification is awaiting a guarantee
from Japan Bank for International Cooperation before proceeding
with a planned sale of Samurai bonds, Khunteta said. It may take
at least two months for the Tokyo-based lender to give an
assurance on the debt, he said. Samurai bonds are debt sold by
overseas borrowers in Japan.
