             European stocks  surged to a three-
month high as HSBC Holdings Plc and BNP Paribas SA led a rally
in banks and basic-resource producers climbed with base metals.  
 HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, and  BNP Paribas , the largest
lender in France, rallied more than 5 percent after reporting
earnings that topped estimates. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
biggest mining company, climbed 4.3 percent. Linde AG advanced
3.8 percent after the second-largest maker of industrial gases
also posted increased profit.  
 The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  soared 2.6 percent to
262.09 at the 4:50 p.m. close in London, the highest level since
April 26. The gauge has surged 13 percent from this year’s low
on May 25 as concern eased that efforts by European governments
to curb their budget deficits may derail the economic recovery.  
 “The results season is providing further evidence for our
view that the European market has overreacted to concerns about
the impact of the sovereign debt crisis on economic activity,”
 Ian Scott , a London-based strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
wrote in a report to clients. “Both the surprise and underlying
growth numbers are strong, helping to override concerns about a
double-dip scenario, which has been weighing on markets.”  
 European Earnings  
 Almost 60 percent of companies in the  Stoxx 600  to have
reported earnings since July 12 have topped analysts’ estimates
for net income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 National benchmark indexes climbed in all of the 17 western
European markets that were open today. Germany’s DAX gained 2.3
percent, the U.K.’s  FTSE 100  rallied 2.7 percent and France’s
CAC 40 advanced 3 percent. Icelandic exchanges were closed for a
holiday.  
 Stocks extended gains after separate reports showed
manufacturing and construction spending in the U.S. exceeded
economist estimates. Other figures today showed European
manufacturing expanded in July by the most in three months.  
 HSBC  climbed 5.3 percent to 680 pence after first-half
pretax profit more than doubled to $11.1 billion as the North
American unit returned to profit and bad-debt provisions dropped
by 46 percent. That compared with the average analyst estimate
of $8.8 billion.  
 BNP Paribas surged 5.3 percent to 55.49 euros after the
bank reported a 31 percent increase in second-quarter net income
to 2.11 billion euros ($2.76 billion) as bad-loan provisions
dropped to the lowest level since before Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.’s 2008 bankruptcy. Earnings topped the 1.61
billion-euro median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 Lloyds, Barclays  
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc , which releases results on Aug. 4,
gained 4.6 percent to 72.44 pence. The U.K.’s largest mortgage
lender expects to post a 1 billion-pound ($1.58 billion) profit
for the first half of the year, according to the Financial
Times.  Barclays Plc , which is scheduled to report on Aug. 5,
climbed 3.4 percent to 343.95 pence.  
 EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA, Greece’s second-biggest bank,
jumped 14 percent to 6.70 euros for the biggest gain in the
Stoxx 600. Alpha Bank SA, the nation’s third-largest lender,
soared 8.1 percent to 6.30 euros.  
 BHP Billiton rose 4.3 percent to 2,034.5 pence as copper
climbed for a fourth day. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-
biggest mining company, gained 4.4 percent to 3,450 pence.
Xstrata Plc jumped 5.9 percent to 1,075 pence.  
 Linde advanced 3.8 percent to 93.32 euros. The maker of
industrial gases reiterated a target of reaching a full-year
earnings record as a rebound in sales helped second-quarter
profit jump to 247 million euros.  
 Intertek  
 Intertek Group Plc  jumped 6.2 percent to 1,674 pence after
the inspection-services company said first-half revenue rose to
652.6 million pounds, citing an improved 2010 outlook.  
 Hammerson Plc gained 2.7 percent to 398.7 pence after the
U.K.’s third-largest real-estate investment trust reported a
first-half profit 333 million pounds as the value of its
properties grew. That compares with a loss of 786.1 million
pounds a year earlier. Net asset value increased by 7.8 percent.  
 Nokia Oyj  climbed 2.7 percent to 7.29 euros and Siemens AG
advanced 3.8 percent to 77.62 euros. The Wall Street Journal
reported that Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between
the two companies, is in discussions with buyout companies
including Silver Lake Partners, TPG Capital, Blackstone Group
LP, Bain Capital LLC and KKR & Co. about obtaining a minority
stake for at least $1 billion in cash. The newspaper cited
unidentified people familiar with the talks.  
 TNT NV retreated 3.7 percent to 22.01 euros, the  largest
drop  in the Stoxx 600. Europe’s second-biggest express-delivery
company reported a 96 percent decline in quarterly profit on a
one-time charge to reorganize the mail division.
