             Citigroup Inc . named Slava Slavinskiy
as head of energy banking for Europe, Middle East and Africa,
replacing Julian Mylchreest.  
 Slavinskiy, 40, joined Citigroup in 1998, covering Russia
and the former Soviet states, the New York-based firm said in an
e-mail to employees today. The memo was confirmed by a Citigroup
spokesman in London. Pablo Escondrillas will also move to London
from Madrid to join the bank’s energy investment banking team,
Citigroup said.  
 Mylchreest moved to Bank of America Corp. last month as co-
head of global energy and power investment banking. His
departure follows those of Bill Kennish, head of European
telecommunications, media and technology banking, who left for
Macquarie Group Ltd. in May, and Reid Marsh who left the
following month for Barclays Plc.  
 Citigroup ranks fourth in advising on energy mergers and
acquisitions this year, up from eighth last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank has advised on about $26.1
billion of energy-related transactions, including Apache Corp.’s
$7 billion purchase of oil and gas fields from BP Plc in July,
the data show.
