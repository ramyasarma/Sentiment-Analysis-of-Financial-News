             Natura Cosmeticos SA , Brazil’s
biggest cosmetics maker, declined the most in a week in Sao
Paulo trading after Banco Santander SA cut its rating on the
stock, citing a “pricey” valuation.  
 Shares dropped 2.6 percent, the most since July 21, to
44.50 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo at 4 p.m. New
York time. The stock surged 26 percent this year before today,
the third-best performance on the benchmark  Bovespa  index.  
 Natura now trades at 22.6 times Santander’s estimated 2011
earnings, a 66 percent premium to international peers, analysts
 Joaquin Ley  and  Tobias Stingelin  wrote in a note to clients
today. Santander cut its recommendation to “underperform” from
“buy.”  
 “We believe that Natura’s earnings growth potential is
largely reflected in the share price,” the analysts wrote.
“Fundamentals remain strong.”  
 Retailer  Lojas Renner SA , the best performer on the Bovespa
this year, dropped the most in two months, losing 4.8 percent to
56.15 reais. Renner had gained 50 percent this year through
yesterday. Tobacco company Souza Cruz SA, the index’s second-
best performer this year, slid the most since November 2009,
tumbling 4.5 percent to 77.16 reais, after advancing 40 percent
in 2010 through yesterday.
