             A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
fell to the lowest in more than two months as manufacturing
slowed less than economists had forecast, spurring investor
optimism that the economy may avoid a double-dip recession.  
 The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index Series
14, which investors use to hedge against losses on corporate
debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, declined 5.24 basis
points to a mid-price of 99.15 basis points, the lowest since
May 12, according to Markit Group Ltd. The index typically falls
as investor confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates.  
 The Markit index declined by the most since May 31 as the
Institute for Supply Management’s  manufacturing gauge  dropped to
55.5 last month from 56.2 in June. A reading greater than 50
points to expansion, and the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was 54.5. Swaps on Ford Motor Co.
fell as its ranking was raised by Standard & Poor’s.  
 “You can see how sensitive the market is to data that is
either slightly stronger than expected or that doesn’t point
directly to a double dip,”  Jason Quinn , co-head of high-grade
and high-yield flow trading at Barclays Capital in New York. “I
think we’re in this window where we’re getting a little bit more
momentum to the upside.”  
 Swaps tied to Ford dropped 19.3 basis points to 546.8 basis
points, CMA prices show. The company’s  credit rating  was raised
two steps to B+, the fourth level below investment-grade, from
B-, S&P said today in a statement. The outlook is positive,
indicating there’s at least a one-in-three chance that S&P may
raise Ford’s corporate credit rating in the next 12 months.  
 ‘Substantial’ Cash Balances  
 The automaker, based in Dearborn, Michigan, has
“substantial” cash balances and likely will continue to
generate free operating cash flow, the ratings firm said.  
 Ford, last year’s biggest issuer of high-yield corporate
debt, on July 28 sold $1.25 billion of 6.625 percent notes due
in 2017 at a yield of 6.9 percent through its finance unit,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The Ford Motor Credit Co. debt rose 0.688 cent to 99.875
cents on the dollar, yielding 6.6 percent, or 370.9 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, as of 12:50 p.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  
 Swaps tied to  Newell Rubbermaid Inc.  fell 13.6 basis points
to 112 basis points, CMA prices show. The maker of Calphalon
cookware and Sharpie markers sold $550 million of 10-year notes
that yield 175 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  
 Proceeds will be used to help fund a tender offer for
Newell’s 10.6 percent notes due 2019 and the repurchase of $500
million of its stock, the Atlanta-based company said in a
statement distributed by Business Wire.  
 Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.
