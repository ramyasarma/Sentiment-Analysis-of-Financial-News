             Oil rose to the highest level in
almost three months as China’s economic outlook and advancing
equities reassured investors the global recovery is on track.  
 Crude oil surged past $80 a barrel in New York on
speculation that China’s government will reverse policies aimed
at slowing growth in the world’s largest energy user. Indexes of
Chinese manufacturing dropped to the lowest level in more than a
year, two reports showed today. The  Shanghai Composite Index 
gained 1.3 percent. Crude also climbed as the dollar weakened.  
 “The Chinese data can be interpreted as helpful
intervention by the government to control and direct economic
growth,” said  Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Bache
Commodities Ltd. in London. “The question is whether oil is
having a false break, as fundamentals are not yet sufficiently
robust to sustain prices in the $80 area.”  
 Crude for September delivery gained as much as $1.48, or
1.9 percent, to $80.43 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest price since May 5. It was at $80.35 at
13:47 p.m. London time. Brent crude for September settlement
gained as much as $1.61, or 2.1 percent, to $79.79 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  
 U.S. natural gas futures surpassed $5 per million British
thermal units for the first time since June 21. Gas for
September delivery rose for a sixth day in electronic trading on
Nymex, trading as high as $5.007.  
 Oil futures climbed 4.4 percent in New York in July, the
biggest monthly gain since March.  
 A weather system nearing the southeastern Caribbean has a
90 percent chance of strengthening into a tropical depression,
the National Hurricane Center said.  
 China Manufacturing  
 European stocks rose for the first time in four days on
gains among banks and basic-resource producers. The U.S.
currency fell to $1.3068 per euro at 12:39 p.m. London time,
from $1.3052 in New York on July 30.  
 “As long as the U.S. dollar is weaker, the U.S. interest
rate is lower, people may take the risk of investing money in
commodities,” said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at
Astmax Co. in Tokyo. “I’m quite positive on the market.”  
 Manufacturing in China contracted for the first time in 16
months in July, according to a survey by HSBC Holdings Plc. A
purchasing managers’ index released today by HSBC and Markit
Economics fell to 49.4 from 50.4 in June.  
 The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 51.2 in July, the
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said yesterday. A reading
above 50 shows an expansion.  
 The country’s full-year economic growth may be as much as
9.5 percent compared with 9.1 percent in 2009, State Council
researcher  Zhang Liqun  said yesterday.  
 U.S. Growth  
 Oil tumbled as much as 2 percent on July 30 after the U.S.
Commerce Department reported gross domestic product slowed to a
2.4 percent annual rate in the three months to June as consumer
spending growth slumped. The figure was less than the 2.6
percent median forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long positions, or bets that prices will rise in the
week ended July 27, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  
 Speculative long positions outnumbered short positions by
44,313 contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
Washington-based commission said in its Commitments of Traders
report. Net-long positions rose by 8,168 contracts, or 23
percent, from a week earlier.
