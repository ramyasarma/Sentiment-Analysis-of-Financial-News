             Palm Hills Developments SAE , Egypt’s
second-biggest publicly traded real estate company, signed an
agreement with Jumeirah Group to manage a hotel at its Red Sea
resort.  
 Dubai-based Jumeirah will manage the 250-room hotel in the
Palm Gamsha project, a collection of man-made islands off
Egypt’s eastern coast, Palm Hills said in a statement to the
Egyptian Exchange today.  
 Palm Hills shares rose 2.3 percent to 4.87 Egyptian pounds
at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the highest level in more than
a month, valuing the company at 5.1 billion Egyptian pounds
($900 million).  
 The company was rated “hold” at Deutsche Bank AG last
month with a price estimate of 5.9 pounds.
