             Fourty-one percent of Kenyan banks
expect to increase credit by about 10 percent over the remainder
of 2010, according to a survey cited by Kenyan central bank
Governor Njunguna Ndung’u.  
 “Growth is no longer fragile,” Ndung’u told reporters in
the capital, Nairobi, today. “Economic recovery is on course
with increased optimism for enhanced growth in 2010 hence the
need for banks to increase credit to the private sector,” 
Ndung’u said.
