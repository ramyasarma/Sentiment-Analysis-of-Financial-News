             Metro AG , Germany’s largest retailer,
said its second-quarter profit unexpectedly fell 15 percent as
the company spent more to eliminate jobs.  
 Net income  fell to 44 million euros ($57.6 million), or 13
cents a share, from 52 million euros, or 16 cents, a year
earlier, the Dusseldorf-based company said today in a statement.
That missed the 87 million-euro average estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 2.4 percent to 15.7
billion euros.  
 Metro aims to lift  profit  by 1.5 billion euros over four
years through its Shape 2012 program as it slashes jobs at its
Cash & Carry unit. The retailer generates almost half its
revenue from wholesale operations, which have lost appeal to
hotel owners and catering companies in some western European
countries.  
 The company repeated that earnings before special items
this year will “tangibly exceed” the 2.02 billion euros
reported in 2009. Sales will be less than the company’s medium-
term 6 percent growth target, though they will be higher than
last year.  
 Metro has said it will eliminate an additional 900 jobs, or
6 percent of its workforce, at its domestic Cash & Carry unit
after having already cut 1,000 positions. The company is trying
to turn around a business that has been in decline for more than
five years.  
 Interest Payments  
 The retailer spent 21 million euros more than a year
earlier for interest payments as it changed short-term debt into
long-term loans. Metro will spend 2.1 billion euros this year to
open new stores, more than the previously planned 1.9 billion
euros.  
 Metro gets about a quarter of sales from eastern Europe,
where sales fell 0.9 percent in local-currency terms. The 10
eastern members of the European Union will remain affected by
high unemployment, the World Bank said last month. Jobless rates
in the region climbed to about 10 percent in May, led by the
three Baltic countries and Slovakia, from an average 6.5 percent
in June 2008, according to the World Bank.  
 Revenue from the region rose 6.1 percent as eastern
European currencies advanced against the euro.
