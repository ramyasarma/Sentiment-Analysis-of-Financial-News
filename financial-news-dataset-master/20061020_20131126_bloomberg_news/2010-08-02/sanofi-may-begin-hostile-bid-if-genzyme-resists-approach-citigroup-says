             Sanofi-Aventis SA  may begin a hostile
bid for Genzyme Corp. should the U.S. biotechnology company
resist a takeover approach, analysts at Citigroup Inc. said.  
 No other bidder is likely to emerge for Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Genzyme, and Sanofi will probably succeed in
acquiring the company for $74 to $77 a share, Citigroup analysts
 Mark Dainty  and  Yaron Werber  wrote in a report to clients today.
Genzyme is worth $70 a share based on estimated cash flow, and
Sanofi would benefit from as much as $5.50 a share of synergies
in an acquisition, they said.  
 Investors in Genzyme say Paris-based Sanofi may have to pay
at least $80 a share, or $21.3 billion, to acquire the maker of
drugs that fight genetic diseases. Sanofi Chief Executive
Officer  Chris Viehbacher  has support from his board to offer as
much as $70 a share, or about $18.7 billion, and is preparing a
formal offer letter, three people familiar with the situation
said last week.  
 “If Genzyme management are resistant or commanding an
unfair price, it is possible that Sanofi will launch a direct
tender offer to shareholders to bypass management and the
board,” Dainty and Werber wrote.  
 A purchase at $74 to $77 a share would add to Sanofi’s
earnings, the analysts said. Viehbacher reiterated in a
conference call with analysts last week that any acquisition
would have to add to  profit . Sanofi, France’s biggest drugmaker,
has declined to comment on Genzyme. Reached today,  Jean-Marc Podvin , a company spokesman, again declined to comment.  
 Genzyme Cut Back Defenses  
 Genzyme  shares  rose 80 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $70.36 at
4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Werber,
who’s based in New York, cut his rating on Genzyme to “hold”
from “buy” and raised his price  forecast  for the stock to $76
from $64. Dainty, who works in London, reiterated his “buy”
rating on Sanofi.  
 “While we think a deal is likely, we see likely deal price
at mid/high $70s, and so we are advocating taking some profits
off the table in case a deal falls through,” the analysts
wrote.  
 Sanofi may make a formal offer to Genzyme within weeks at
$68 to $70 a share, and Genzyme may ask in return for $80 or
more, according to Dainty and Werber. Should an agreement not be
reached, investors would welcome a hostile bid even at less than
$80 a share, they wrote.  
 Genzyme, under pressure from investors, has cut back its
defenses against a hostile takeover in recent years, the
analysts said. The company’s entire board is up for  election 
annually, and in June shareholders reduced the threshold
required to call a special meeting to 40 percent of shares from
90 percent.  
 “The company is more susceptible to a hostile bid and the
board more exposed to shareholder pressure than is typical for
U.S. companies,” the analysts wrote.  
 Sanofi rose 84 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 45.41 euros in
Paris trading.
