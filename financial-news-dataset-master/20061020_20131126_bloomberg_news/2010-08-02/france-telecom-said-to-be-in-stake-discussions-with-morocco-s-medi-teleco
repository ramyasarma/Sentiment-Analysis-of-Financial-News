             France Telecom SA  is in talks to buy
a stake in Medi Telecom SA, Morocco’s second-largest phone
operator, said a person familiar with the situation.  
 No decision has yet been made and Meditel is holding
similar discussions with other companies, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private. France
Telecom spokesman  Tom Wright  today confirmed the company’s
“interest in the Moroccan telecom market” and declined to
comment on possible negotiations with Meditel.  
 France Telecom, which has said it’s earmarking as much as 7
billion euros ($9.16 billion) to expand in Africa and the Middle
East, is seeking to double emerging-market revenue in five years
and reduce dependence on a slow-growing domestic market. The
Paris-based company is studying four to five acquisitions,
executive director for Africa, the Middle East, and Asia  Marc Rennard  said in June.  
 Entering the Moroccan market would bring France Telecom
into direct competition with French rival  Vivendi SA , the
majority owner of Maroc Telecom, the country’s largest operator.
Vivendi, which also owns France’s No. 2 operator, SFR, has used
Maroc Telecom as a vehicle for mobile acquisitions in countries
including Burkina Faso and Mali.  
 A Meditel spokesman said the company had no comment. He
declined to be identified in accordance with company policy.  
 Telefonica SA  and  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA  both held 32
percent stakes in Meditel until last September, which they sold
for 400 million euros each.
