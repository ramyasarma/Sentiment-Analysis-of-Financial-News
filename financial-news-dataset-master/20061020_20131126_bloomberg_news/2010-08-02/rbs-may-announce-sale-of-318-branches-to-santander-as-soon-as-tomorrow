             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  may
announce the sale of 318 branches to Spain’s  Banco Santander SA 
as soon as tomorrow, two people familiar with the talks said.  
 RBS has reached an agreement to sell the outlets, most of
which were formerly part of Williams & Glyn’s, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the talks are private. RBS
formed Williams & Glyn’s in 1969 to merge its branches in
England and Wales, before subsuming it fully in 1985. Officials
at RBS and Santander declined to comment.  
 RBS is selling the branches to comply with European Union
regulations after it received 45.5 billion pounds ($72 billion)
in a government bailout during the credit crisis. The purchase
will give Santander about 1,600 outlets, making it the U.K.’s
fourth-biggest bank by branches after Lloyds Banking Group Plc,
Barclays Plc and Edinburgh-based RBS, according data compiled by
the British Bankers’ Association.  
 Santander, which acquired Abbey National in 2004, has since
boosted its presence in the U.K. with the acquisitions of
Alliance & Leicester Plc and parts of Bradford & Bingley Plc.
The lender may sell a stake in its U.K. unit in an initial
public offering in London, Chief Executive Officer Alfredo Saenz
said last month.  
 RBS may also announce the disposal of its Global Merchant
Services unit, also known as Worldpay this week, one of the
people said. The bank will report half-year results on Aug. 6.
