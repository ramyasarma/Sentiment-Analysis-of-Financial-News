             Toyota Motor Corp.  and  Honda Motor
Co. , Japan’s two biggest automakers, led the 12th straight
increase in the nation’s monthly auto sales as government
incentives boosted demand.  
 Sales  of cars, trucks and buses, excluding minicars,
rose 15 percent to 333,403 vehicles in July from a year
earlier, the  Japan Automobile Dealers Association  said in a
statement today. Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, sold
161,444 units, excluding Lexus-brand cars, up 19 percent.  
 Japan’s auto sales started recovering from a yearlong
decline in August as government rebates and tax cuts for
fuel-efficient vehicles revived demand. The incentives helped
raise sales by about 600,000 vehicles last year and may
increase them by about 900,000 this year, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association said in December.  
 July sales rose 15 percent at Honda to 50,448 units,
while  Nissan Motor Co. , the nation’s third-largest automaker,
sold 50,719 vehicles, a rise of 2.3 percent.  
 Toyota  shares  gained 1.8 percent to 3,105 yen as of 2:11
p.m. in Tokyo, while shares of Honda increased 3.8 percent.
Nissan fell 0.2 percent.
