             Linde AG , the world’s second-biggest
maker of industrial gases, reiterated a target of reaching a
full-year earnings record as a rebound in sales helped second-
quarter profit jump 86 percent.  
 Net income  rose to 247 million euros ($325 million), or
1.45 euros a share, from 133 million euros, or 78 cents, a year
earlier, Munich-based Linde said today in a  statement . Sales
increased 15 percent to 3.21 billion euros, Linde said. Earnings
and revenue beat the average  estimates  of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 “The upward trend is continuing” as “we have
increasingly seen a rise in demand worldwide,” Chief Executive
Officer  Wolfgang Reitzle  said in the statement. “We are well on
the way to achieving a faster rate of growth in group operating
profit than in group sales, and exceeding the group operating
profit of record year 2008.”  
 The German company and larger competitor  Air Liquide SA ,
which also  reported earnings  today, have benefited from
rebounding global economies that have raised demand for
industrial gases used by steelmakers and pharmaceutical
companies. Air Liquide said growth resumed at the fastest pace
in  emerging markets . Linde said the greater Chinese market is
producing the highest growth rates at its gases unit, while the
improvement in western Europe and the U.S. remains “modest.”  
 Shares Gain  
 Linde  rose  3.7 percent to 93.32 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Frankfurt today, its biggest advance since December.
The shares have  gained  11 percent this year, valuing Linde at
15.8 billion euros.  
 Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted net income of
217 million euros for Linde on sales of 3.04 billion euros in
the quarter.  
 First-half operating profit rose 26 percent to 1.4 billion
euros. Net income gained 79 percent to 445 million euros and
sales increased 11 percent to 6.1 billion euros.  
 Targets  for Linde’s gases division, which generated about
80 percent of revenue in the first half, still apply, with the
division probably posting a sales increase and record operating
profit this year, the company said.
