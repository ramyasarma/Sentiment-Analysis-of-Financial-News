             Wheat futures surged to a 22-month
high in Chicago, leading grains higher, on speculation that
dry, hot weather in Russia may force the country to curb
exports, squeezing global supplies.  
 Temperatures in Russia may climb to 42 degrees Celsius
(107.6 degrees Fahrenheit) through Aug. 7, the country’s weather
center said on its website today. Although there’s no official
statement about export restrictions, the market doesn’t rule out
such a scenario, Phillip Futures Pte. said in note today.  
 “It’s very, very bullish and there’s no sign of it really
stopping,”  Peter McGuire , managing director at CWA Global
Markets Pty, said by phone from Sydney. “I wouldn’t be
surprised if it reaches $7 within the next two trading
sessions.”  
 The September-delivery contract jumped as much as 3.4
percent to $6.84 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest level since Oct. 1, 2008, and was at $6.8275 at 11:06
a.m. London time. Prices jumped 38 percent in July, the biggest
gainer of 24 raw materials in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index.  
 Milling wheat for November delivery surged 5.4 percent to
205.75 euros ($269) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris. The
November contract climbed 34 percent last month and today
climbed to the highest price since trading started in March
2009.  
 Russia’s wheat harvest may amount to 45 million tons, Anton
Shaparin, a spokesman for the Moscow-based Russian Grain Union,
said on July 27. That compares with a harvest of about 62
million tons last year.  
 Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  is due to meet regional
leaders in Moscow today to discuss wildfires.  
 Corn for December delivery rose as much as 1.9 percent to
$4.1425 a bushel, the highest price for the most-active contract
since Jan. 12. November-delivery soybeans rallied as much as 1.7
percent to $10.2175 a bushel, the highest price since Jan. 11.
Chicago rice futures surged as much as 3.6 percent to $10.93 for
every 100 pounds.
