             Coffee futures dropped, halting a
rally to a 12-year high, amid signs of ample supplies from
Brazil, the world’s largest producer. Cocoa fell from a two-week
high.  
 Earlier today, arabica reached $1.815 a pound, the highest
level for a most-active contract since Feb. 6, 1998, and above
fair value, said  James Cordier , an OptionSellers.com portfolio
manager. Crops in Brazil are forecast to get typical levels of
rain in the September flowering period, said  Expedito Rebello ,
research head at the government’s Meteorology Institute.  
 “The Brazilian crop obviously is well into its harvest,
and it’s absolutely enormous,” said Cordier in Tampa, Florida.
As that supply enters the market, along with beans from
Colombia, the second-largest arabica grower, prices will be
under “a little bit more pressure,” he said.  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery fell 3.8 cents, or
2.2 percent, to close at $1.725 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Before today, coffee jumped 30 percent this
year.  
 Brazil will harvest 47 million 60-kilogram (132-pound)
coffee bags this year, up 19 percent from 39.5 million bags last
year, the Agriculture Ministry said on May 6.  
 Arabica futures climbed as much as 3 percent earlier as
equities on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  jumped.  
 Resilient Recovery  
 “The S&P is dragging everything higher,” including
coffee, said  Hector Galvan , a senior trading adviser at RJO
Futures in Chicago. “As of right now, the economies of the
world are holding their recoveries.”  
 On the Liffe exchange in London, robusta-coffee futures for
September delivery fell $32, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $1,778
a metric ton at 5:30 p.m. local time.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery dropped $9, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $3,082 a ton at 12:03 p.m. in New York.
Earlier, prices reached $3,108, the highest level for a most-
active contract since July 19. The price has dropped 6.3 percent
this year.  
 In London, cocoa futures for September delivery lost 16
pounds, or 0.7 percent, to settle at 2,257 pounds ($3,594) a ton
at 4:56 p.m. local time.
