             Iran’s gasoline imports fell 50
percent last month as sanctions over the nation’s nuclear
program spurred traders to halt supplies, according to Energy
Market Consultants Ltd.  
 Iran received about 60,000 barrels a day in July, compared
with 120,000 in May,  Vijay Mukherji , a London-based research
associate at EMC, said by phone today. The consultant revised
its earlier estimate of 65,000 to 70,000 barrels a day.  
 “International trading companies have pulled back,”
Mukherji said. “The U.S., Europe and the UN are aiming to cut
Iran off. They just don’t want them to get any oil-product
supplies.”  
 U.S. President Barack Obama signed legislation on July 1
that punishes foreign suppliers of Iran’s gasoline and blocks
access to the American financial system for banks that do
business with the country. Gasoline sanctions weren’t mandated
by the UN or imposed by the European Union.  
 Shipments of the fuel are now dominated by Turkish and
Chinese companies, Mukherji said. Before the sanctions, Emirati,
Russian and international trading companies were also
significant suppliers, he said.  
 Three state-controlled Russian oil companies, including OAO
Rosneft and OAO Gazprom Neft, may begin delivering gasoline to
Iran in a month, Rajab Safarov, head of the Iran Commission of
the Moscow Chamber of Commerce & Industry, said yesterday.  
 EMC is a unit of Facts Global Energy, whose figures are
cited by the U.S. Energy Department. The company gathers its
information from traders, officials in Iran and information in
the public domain, Mukherji said.
