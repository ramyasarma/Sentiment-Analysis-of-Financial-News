             Crude oil climbed to the highest in
four days as increased profit forecasts drove Asian equities
higher and investors grew more optimistic that China’s growth
will bolster fuel demand.  
 Oil traded above $79 a barrel in New York after Asian
stocks rose for the sixth time in seven days. China’s full-year
economic growth may be as much as 9.5 percent compared with 9.1
percent in 2009, State Council researcher Zhang Liqun said
yesterday. About 42 percent of the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s
companies that posted profit since July 12 have beaten analyst
estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 “The China market should be quite steady,” said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at Astmax Co. in Tokyo. “Equity
markets should be the main driver for the crude oil market.”  
 Crude for September delivery gained as much as 40 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $79.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest intraday price since July 27. It was at
$79.21 at 3:14 p.m. Singapore time. The contract rose 59 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $78.95 on July 30. Futures climbed 4.4
percent in July, the biggest monthly gain since March.  
 Oil also advanced because of a weaker dollar. The U.S.
currency fell to $1.3069 per euro at 3:04 p.m. Singapore time,
from $1.3052 in New York on July 30.  
 “As long as the U.S. dollar is weaker, the U.S. interest
rate is lower, people may take the risk of investing money in
commodities,” said Astmax’s Emori. “I’m quite positive on the
market.”  
 China Manufacturing  
 Brent crude for September settlement gained as much as 42
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $78.60 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange and was at $78.45 a barrel at 3:04
p.m. Singapore time. The contract rose 59 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $78.18 a barrel on July 30.  
 Oil rose even as manufacturing in China contracted for the
first time in 16 months in July, according to a survey by HSBC
Holdings Plc. A purchasing managers’ index released today by
HSBC and Markit Economics fell to 49.4 from 50.4 in June.  
 The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 51.2 in July, the
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said yesterday. A reading
above 50 shows an expansion.  
 The fastest-growing  major economy  is cooling as the
government clamps down on property speculation, trims credit
growth and shutters energy-intensive and polluting factories.  
 U.S. Growth  
 Oil tumbled as much as 2 percent on July 30 after the
Commerce Department reported gross domestic product slowed to a
2.4 percent annual rate in the three months to June as consumer
spending growth slumped. The figure was less than the 2.6
percent median forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “Oil prices have swung back to the top of the $75-to-$80
range despite slowing economic growth headlines from China and
the U.S., thanks to anticipation that more stimulus measures
will materialize,” said  Gordon Kwan , head of regional energy
research at Mirae Asset Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long positions, or bets that prices will rise in the
week ended July 27, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  
 Speculative long positions outnumbered short positions by
44,313 contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
Washington-based commission said in its Commitments of Traders
report. Net-long positions rose by 8,168 contracts, or 23
percent, from a week earlier.
