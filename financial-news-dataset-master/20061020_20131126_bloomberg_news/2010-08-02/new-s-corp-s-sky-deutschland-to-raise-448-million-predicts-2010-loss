             Sky Deutschland AG , 45.4 percent-
owned by  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp., said it will raise at
least 340 million euros ($448 million) for investment after
posting a loss in the second quarter.  
 The company will sell new shares to shareholders and either
sell convertible bonds or get a loan from a News Corp. unit, it
said today in a statement.  
 Sky Deutschland  said  it will post a loss before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2010 following a loss of
262.7 million euros in 2009, because of “slower-than-expected
subscriber development.” It said 2011 will be “significantly
better” than this year “but will still remain negative.”  
 “This takes a level of uncertainty out of our business,”
said Chief Executive Officer  Brian Sullivan  on a conference
call. “And, it is a further iteration in (News Corp.’s) and our
belief in the potential of the business.”  
 He confirmed that this is the seventh time Sky Deutschland,
formerly Premiere AG, had raised capital since it was listed on
the stock exchange in March 2005. Sullivan said he couldn’t say
when Sky Deutschland will break even on an Ebitda basis.  
 In the second quarter, the Ebitda loss narrowed to 47
million euros from 63.4 million euros a year earlier.  
 The share sale will take place in September or October,
Sky Deutschland said. It is structured so that News Corp. won’t
assume a stake of more than 49.9 percent unless it chooses to do
so, News Corp. said in a separate statement.  
 The Royal Bank of Scotland and UniCredit Bank AG will be
joint global coordinators and joint lead managers of the share
sale.
