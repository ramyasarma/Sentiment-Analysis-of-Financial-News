             The Tampa Bay Rays pulled within one
game of the first-place New York Yankees with a 3-0 win against
their American League East rivals.  
 James Shields  pitched 7 1/3 shutout innings yesterday as
the Rays took two of three games in the series at Tropicana
Field in Tampa, Florida.  
 Tampa Bay has won eight of its last nine games to improve
to 65-39, the second-best record in Major League Baseball behind
the Yankees at 66-38.  
 Alex Rodriguez  didn’t start for the Yankees as he seeks to
become the seventh major-league player with 600 home runs. He
struck out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning and has gone
38 at-bats since belting his 599th homer on July 22.  
 The Yankees open a three-game series at home today against
the Toronto Blue Jays.
