             Grupo Mexicana de Aviacion, Mexico’s
biggest airline by passengers, is in talks with several
international investors as it considers whether to file for
bankruptcy, Chief Executive Officer Manuel Borja Chico said.  
 The airline is not discussing a merger with Consorcio
Aeromexico SA, its biggest Mexican rival, Borja said today in
an interview broadcast on Radio Formula in Mexico City. The
airline seeks an agreement with unions for a “competitive” new
labor contract, Borja said.
