              India’s government will raise about
9.6 billion rupees ($208 million) from a sale of shares in
 Engineers India Ltd. , Disinvestment Secretary  Sumit Bose  said in
New Delhi today.  
 A panel of government ministers set the price of Engineers
India shares at 290 rupees apiece, Bose said. The share sale
price is at a 12 percent discount to the stock’s closing price
today.  
 India is tapping investor appetite for the South Asian
nation’s equities after companies raised more than 654 billion
rupees from shares sales this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg, putting the market on course to exceed 2008’s
record 782 billion rupees. The government plans to raise 400
billion rupees from share sales in the year ending March 31.  
 Shares of New Delhi-based  Engineers India  rose 1.5 percent
to 328.5 rupees at close of trade in Mumbai today. The
announcement was made after market close.  
 India announced the sale of about 33.7 million shares, or a
10 percent stake, in the state-owned provider of engineering
services to oil, gas and petrochemical companies in July.  
 ICICI Securities Ltd., HSBC Securities & Capital Markets
(India) Pvt.,  IDFC Capital Ltd.  and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. are
managing the sale.
