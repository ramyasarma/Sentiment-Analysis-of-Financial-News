             Alexander Classen , head of  Morgan
Stanley ’s wealth-management operations in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, has left the firm after four years.  
 The New York-based bank hasn’t named a replacement, said
spokesman  Jim Wiggins , who confirmed Classen’s departure.
Classen joined Morgan Stanley in 2006 from  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. , the same year that  James Gorman , now chief executive
officer, came in to turn around the brokerage.  
 Morgan Stanley paid $2.75 billion last year to win control
of a joint venture with  Citigroup Inc. ’s Smith Barney that
includes about 18,000 financial advisers, making it the world’s
biggest brokerage.  
 Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will look to expand outside the
U.S. because those markets are set to grow faster,  Charles Johnston , the unit’s president, said in April. The global
wealth-management division had net new international assets of
$2.4 billion in the second quarter, compared with outflows of
$7.9 billion in the U.S.  
 “We don’t have a large enough footprint in those
markets,” Johnston said in April. “We’d like it to be bigger,
and there’s only two ways to do that -- you can buy something or
you can grow organically. There hasn’t been much that’s been
available to buy. We’ve talked about some deals, but we’re going
on the path of organic growth.”  
 Dow Jones Newswire reported Classen’s departure earlier
today.
