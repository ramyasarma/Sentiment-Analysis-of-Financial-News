             Gold advanced for a fourth day, the 
longest winning streak in two months, as investors sought to 
preserve their wealth after China reported the slowest 
manufacturing growth in 17 months, reviving concern that the 
global economic recovery may slow.  
 Gold for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.3 percent to
$1,184.17 an ounce before trading at $1,183.65 an ounce at 
1:20 p.m. in Singapore. The metal declined 4.9 percent in
July, the biggest monthly drop this year. December-delivery
futures were little changed at $1,185.60.  
 “Gold may continue to edge up on follow-through strength
after Friday’s surge,” said Ong Yi Ling, Singapore-based
investment analyst with Phillips Futures Pte Ltd. “Investors
will remain concerned that the pace of the economic recovery
may slow, fueling demand for gold.”  
 The  Purchasing Managers’ Index  in China fell to 51.2 in
July from 52.1 in June, the Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said yesterday. U.S. unemployment probably climbed
in July, raising the risk that American households will keep a
lid on spending, economists said before a report this week.  
 “Following a series of gloomy economic data, rising
economic uncertainty could revive haven demand,” said  Hwang Il Doo , a Seoul-based senior trader at KEB Futures Co., predicting
that the metal may advance to as much as $1,200 an ounce.  
 Nine of 22 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 41 percent, said bullion will rise this week on
speculation recent price falls will spur investment and
physical demand. Eight forecast lower prices and five were
neutral.  
 Gold has gained 7.8 percent this year and is set for a
10th annual advance, the longest winning streak since at least
1920, as investors sought protection against Europe’s financial
turmoil, weaker currencies and concern there may be a double-
dip recession.  
 Silver for immediate delivery increased 0.8 percent to
$18.065 an ounce, platinum advanced 1 percent to $1,587.95 an
ounce, while palladium was little changed at $497.25 an ounce.
