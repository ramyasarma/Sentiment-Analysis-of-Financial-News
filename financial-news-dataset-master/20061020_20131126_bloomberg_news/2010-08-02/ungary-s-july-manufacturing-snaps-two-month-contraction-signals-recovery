             Hungarian manufacturing expanded in
July, snapping a two-month decline, signaling a recovery from
the country’s worst recession in 18 years.  
 The purchasing managers’ index rose to a seasonally-
adjusted 53.5 in July, from 49.6 the previous month, the
Hungarian Logistics, Purchasing and Inventory Society said in an
e-mail today.
