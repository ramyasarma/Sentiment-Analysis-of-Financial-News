             Russia’s Micex Index advanced to its
highest in three months as oil topped $81 a barrel and
speculation China will reverse policies aimed at cooling the
economy boosted demand for riskier assets.  
 OAO Gazprom , the country’s gas export monopoly, increased
3.7 percent and  OAO Rosneft , Russia’s biggest oil producer,
added 3.1 percent. Steelmaker  OAO Severstal  jumped 6.2 percent.
Those movements pushed the 30-stock gauge 2.3 percent higher to
1,429.36 at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its strongest level
since April 30.  
 Oil surged to its highest in three months, rising as much
as 3.1 percent to $81.50 a barrel in New York and boosting the
outlook for producers in the world’s biggest energy exporter.
Emerging-market stocks gained after China said manufacturing
grew at the slowest pace in 17 months, prompting speculation the
third-biggest economy won’t require more tightening.  
 “Oil is helping the Russian market today,”  John Heisel , a
sales trader at Citigroup Inc. in Moscow, said by telephone.
“China’s PMI figures were also a boost for commodity markets.”  
 OAO Uralkali , Russia’s second-biggest potash producer,
climbed the most since Jan. 11, gaining 9.8 percent to 139.83
rubles after Vedomosti said its billionaire owner planned to buy
a controlling stake in  OAO Silvinit  as early as this month.
Silvinit gained 4 percent to 19,558.67 rubles.  
 Copper rose to a three-month high, wiping out this year’s
drop after gaining 1.3 percent, to $7,391 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange. Aluminum, zinc, nickel and lead climbed
to the highest since May.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , Russia’s
biggest miner, added 2.8 percent to 5,115.98 rubles.  
 Philip Poole , global head of macro and investment strategy
at HSBC Global Asset Management U.K. Ltd., said the company
raised Russia’s weighting in its BRIC fund at the expense of
India.  
 Russia is “our big overweight” because of its cheapness,
Poole said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.  
 “Some big funds are trying to break rank and add more
Russia on the belief that the global economy will avoid a double
dip,” said  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib Financial
Corp., by phone in London.
