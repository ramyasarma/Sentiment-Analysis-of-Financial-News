             India’s rupee strengthened for a
third day on optimism funds will add to record holdings of the
nation’s assets to benefit from higher yields.  
 Overseas investors’ holdings of Indian equities climbed to
 $83 billion  on July 29, while their debt holdings are near a
 $15.4 billion  peak touched on July 16, the Securities & Exchange
Board of India said last week. Gross domestic product expanded
8.6 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the third-fastest pace
among major economies. India’s 10-year bond yields are now at
7.86 percent, compared with 2.94 percent for similar-maturity
U.S. Treasuries.  
 “India is sustaining its strong economic trend, which
isn’t something you can say about much of the rest of the world,
and that’s drawing flows,” said  Sudarshan Bhatt , chief currency
trader in Mumbai at state-owned Corporation Bank. “Interest-
rate premiums are helping too. The rupee will keep a positive
bias.”  
 The rupee appreciated 0.3 percent to 46.25 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency earlier touched 46.11, its strongest
level since June 28.  
 Offshore forward contracts indicated the rupee will trade
at 46.83 to the dollar in three months, compared with
expectations for a rate of 47.08 at the end of last week.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  
 The Reserve Bank of India raised its overnight  borrowing
rate  on July 27 for a fourth time this year to 4.5 percent to
curb inflation.  
 The rupee also advanced as a report showed manufacturing
growth accelerated in July. The Purchasing Managers’ Index rose
to 57.6 from 57.3 in June, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics said in an e-mailed statement today. A reading above
50 indicates expansion.
