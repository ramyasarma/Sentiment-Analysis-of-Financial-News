             Stats Chippac Ltd ., the Singapore-
based provider of semiconductor test and assembly services,
plans to meet bond investors in Singapore and New York today,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  
 Talks will continue in Hong Kong and Boston tomorrow and in
London on Aug. 4, the person said, asking not to be identified

Bank AG are arranging the meetings, the person said.  
 Stats Chippac plans to sell $600 million of five-year
