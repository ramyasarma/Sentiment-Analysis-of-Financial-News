             Russian crude oil output in July was
little changed from June’s post-soviet record at 10.14 million
barrels a day, while seasonal demand pushed down natural gas
production, the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit said.  
 Crude oil output rose 2.3 percent from July last year
according to the preliminary data distributed by e-mail in
Moscow today. Oil exports rose 5.5 percent from June and 5.2
percent from a year earlier. Russia produced 10.15 million
barrels a day of oil in June.  
 Domestic output at  OAO Lukoil , Russia’s second-largest oil
producer, fell 0.5 percent in the month and dropped an annual
2.8 percent to 1.82 million barrels a day.  
 Lukoil will focus on investing abroad because of Russia’s
tax burden and seek stable output at home, Deputy Chief
Executive  Leonid Fedun  said in March.  
 OAO Rosneft , Russia’s biggest producer, pumped 2.27 million
barrels a day, excluding its half of the Tomskneft unit, up 0.8
percent from June.  OAO Gazprom Neft , excluding its half of
Tomskneft, raised output 0.6 percent to 610,000 barrels a day.  
 OAO Bashneft , controlled by billionaire Vladimir
Yevtushenkov’s AFK Sistema, increased production 0.5 percent to
290,000 barrels a day. It was up 19.2 percent on the year.  
 Russian natural gas output in July fell to 1.42 billion
cubic meters a day from 1.47 billion cubic meters a day in June.
OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas export monopoly, said in June demand
in southern Europe dropped.  
 Production rose 5.2 percent from July last year, when
demand was damped by the global economic crisis.  
 Gazprom, which accounts for about 83 percent of Russian gas
output, cut production by 3.6 percent from June and raised it
2.9 percent from a year earlier.
