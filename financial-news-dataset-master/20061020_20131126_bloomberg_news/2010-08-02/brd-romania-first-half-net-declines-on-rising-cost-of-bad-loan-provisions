             BRD-Groupe Societe Generale SA ,
Romania’s second-biggest lender by assets, said first-half
profit fell 14 percent on rising costs for bad loans.  
 Net income dropped to 367 million lei ($113 million) from
425 million lei a year earlier, the Bucharest-based bank said
today in an earnings statement.  
 The bank, majority-owned by France’s  Societe Generale SA ,
set aside 628 million lei in the first half for provisions
against bad loans, a 54 percent increase from the year-earlier
period, as the worst recession in at least 20 years increased
unemployment and businesses and individuals found it harder to
repay loans. Romania’s economy contracted 7.1 percent last year
and will probably contract again this year by as much as 1.9
percent, according to Finance Ministry estimates.  
 “The bank’s activity is affected by the lingering economic
crisis, which translates into low demand for banking products
and a high level of the net cost of risk,” BRD Chief Executive
Officer  Guy Poupet  said in the statement.  
 Total loans rose 7.1 percent in the period to 34.5 billion
lei. Net-interest income, or the difference between money paid
on deposits and earnings on loans, increased 7 percent to 1.75
billion lei, according to the bank.  
 Net assets increased to 48.6 billion lei from 46.4 billion
lei at the end of 2009, the bank said.
