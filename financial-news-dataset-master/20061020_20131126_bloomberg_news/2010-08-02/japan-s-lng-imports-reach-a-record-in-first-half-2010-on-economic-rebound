             Japan, the world’s biggest importer
of liquefied natural gas, boosted purchases of the fuel by about
9.5 percent to a record in the first half because of the global
 recovery , according to calculations based on official data.  
 Purchases of the cleaner-burning fuel rose to 34.68 million
metric tons in the six months through June from 31.65 million
tons a year earlier, according to data from the  Ministry of
Finance . Imports fell about 8.7 percent in the first half of
2009 from the previous year because of the global recession.  
 Prices for delivered LNG fell 8.6 percent to 49,692 yen
($574) a ton in June from a month earlier, the first decline in
a year, according to the data. That’s equivalent to about $10.90
per million British thermal units, more than twice the price of
U.S. benchmark gas futures at Henry Hub, according to Bloomberg
data.  
 Asian LNG imports may increase 8 percent this year after
declining 3 percent in 2009 as the world recovers from the worst
recession since World War II, Facts Global Energy said in a
report in July.  
 Imports climbed in June by 9 percent to 5.6 million tons,
according to the data. Prices rose 38 percent in the month from
a year earlier on higher crude oil prices. Japan didn’t buy spot
cargoes from the Atlantic Ocean area in June while a year
earlier it bought two from Equatorial Guinea.  
 Crude oil futures in New York more than doubled in the 12
months to March 2010 to $83.76 a barrel. Oil for September
delivery traded at $79.12 a barrel at 1:08 p.m. Singapore time.
Natural gas for September traded at $4.979 per million British
thermal units in New York.  
 LNG is natural gas that’s been chilled to liquid form,
reducing it to one-six-hundredth of its original volume at minus
161 degrees Celsius (minus 259 Fahrenheit), for transportation
by ship to destinations not connected by pipeline.
