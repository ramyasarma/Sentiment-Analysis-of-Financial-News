             Mexico’s peso rose to the strongest
level since June as stock-index futures in the U.S. rallied
after European banks reported better-than-expected earnings,
signaling the economic recovery has not slowed down.  
 The peso gained 0.5 percent to 12.5830 per dollar at 9:03
a.m. New York time, from 12.6453 on July 30. The currency has
gained 4 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, the second-
best performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, after Japan’s yen. The peso reached 12.5366 earlier,
the strongest level since June 22.  
 “The market is in a different place than where we were
three or four weeks ago,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency
strategist at Base Internacional Casa de Bolsa SA in Monterrey,
Mexico. “There have been good economic data and earnings, and
we continue to see a strong correlation between the peso and
markets.”  
 HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank, said pretax
profit more than doubled, and BNP Paribas said net income rose
31 percent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures gained 1.4
percent. The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of Mexico’s
exports.  
 The yield on the 10 percent bonds due in 2024 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.82 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA, the lowest level since the
security was issued in 2005. The price of the security rose 0.2
centavo to 129.03 centavos per peso.
