             Turkey’s central bank increased its
daily purchases of dollars from the market, taking advantage of
a stronger lira to build up reserves.  
 The bank will buy $40 million a day, with an option for an
additional $40 million, starting tomorrow, it said in an e-
mailed statement from Ankara today. Previously, the bank had
bought as much as $60 million a day.  
 The bank is “taking advantage of a period when foreign
currency supply exceeds demand in order to increase reserves,”
according to the statement. The lira was little changed after
the announcement, trading at 1.4992 per dollar at 2:39 p.m. in
Istanbul.  
 “We don’t expect this to have an impact on the exchange
rate,”  Tufan Comert , a strategist for Garanti Securities, said
in an e-mailed comment. “We expect inflows to continue and the
lira to continue strengthening.”  
 The bank resumed purchases of dollars on Aug. 4 last year
and has added $11.1 billion to its international reserves
through the auction since then.  Foreign currency reserves  were
$72.9 billion on July 23, according to the latest data from the
bank.  
 The decision to increase the daily purchases follows calls
from exporters for measures to weaken the lira.  Mehmet Buyukeksi , head of the Turkish Exporters’ Assembly, yesterday
called for the bank to buy $50 million and 50 million euros a
day.
