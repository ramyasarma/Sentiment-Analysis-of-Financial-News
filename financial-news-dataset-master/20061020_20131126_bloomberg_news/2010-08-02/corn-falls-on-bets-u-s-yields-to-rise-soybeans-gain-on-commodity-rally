             Corn fell from a 13-month high as
slowing U.S. job growth signaled that a faltering economy may
limit demand for grain used to make food, animal feed and
ethanol.  
 Company payrolls rose less than expected in July, the
government data showed today, signaling the economy may be slow
in recouping the 8.4 million jobs lost since the recession began
in December 2007. The U.S. is the world’s biggest corn grower,
exporter and consumer. Crude oil fell as much as 1.5 percent,
and hog futures slipped to a three-week low.  
 “The economy is not generating enough jobs to support
higher retail spending,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. “Declining meat
demand” is going to slow animal-feed consumption, Roose said.  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 6 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $4.12 a bushel at 10:44 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. A close at that price would be the biggest decline since
July 26.  
 Yesterday, the most-active contract touched $4.39, the
highest price since June 15, 2009, after Russia imposed a ban on
grain exports as a drought damages crops. Before today, corn
gained 20 percent since June 29, the day before the government
said that U.S. farmers planted less this year than they had
planned.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
