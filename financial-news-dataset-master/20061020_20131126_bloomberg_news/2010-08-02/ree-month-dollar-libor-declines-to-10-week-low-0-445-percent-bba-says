             The rate that London-based banks say
they borrow at for three months in dollars fell to the lowest
level in 10 weeks.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such
loans, fell to 0.445 today from 0.454 percent on July 30,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the least
since May 14.  
 The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, fell less than one basis point to 25.4 basis points as
of 11:43 a.m. in London.
