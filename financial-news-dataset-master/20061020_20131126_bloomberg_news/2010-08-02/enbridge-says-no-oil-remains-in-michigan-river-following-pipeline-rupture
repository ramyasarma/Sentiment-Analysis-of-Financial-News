             MARSHALL, Mich.,  Aug. 2 (UPI) -- No oil remains in the 
Kalamazoo River more than one week after one of the world's 
longest oil pipelines burst in southern Michigan, an energy 
company said.  
 A 30-inch-diameter oil pipeline ruptured July 26, sending 
oil into nearby Talmadge Creek and the Kalamazoo River.  
 Enbridge Energy Partners, the Canadian company that 
operates the pipeline on the Lakehead system, said in a 
statement that "no oil remains" in the Kalamazoo River and 
"sheen only remains upstream of Battle Creek."  
 The company said they didn't know what caused the rupture 
or exactly how much oil was released into waterways in southern 
Michigan. Preliminary estimates said more than 20,000 barrels 
of oil spilled, though Enbridge said that roughly "10,000 
barrels of oil have been removed from the waterways."  
 Regional officials with the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency said the spill shouldn't pose a threat to Lake Michigan.  
 Concerns about air quality south of Battle Creek led to 
the evacuations Thursday, following 30 voluntary departures 
earlier last week. Southern Michigan officials were warning 
area residents to avoid coming into contact with contaminated 
water.
