             Swiss stocks rose for the first time
in three days, as exporters and financial shares increased.  
 ABB Ltd. advanced 2.7 percent, while  Adecco SA  increased
4.7 percent.  UBS AG  and  Credit Suisse Group AG , Switzerland’s
two biggest banks, gained 1.7 percent and 3.8 percent
respectively.  Swiss Life Holding AG  increased 2.2 percent, as
UBS lifted its stance on Europe’s insurers.  Xstrata Plc  climbed
5.7 percent, as base metals advanced in London.  
 The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  increased 120.86, or 2
percent, to 6,321.64 in Zurich. The SMI has retreated 9.3
percent from this year’s high on April 15 amid speculation that
Europe’s debt crisis may derail the economic recovery and
concern that Chinese authorities are cooling their nation’s rate
of growth. The broader  Swiss Performance Index  gained 1.9
percent today.  
 “The earnings season so far has been much better than
expected,” Nomura senior strategist Shanthi Nair wrote in a
note dated July 30. “Companies appear to have beaten
expectations by a healthy margin in most regions, surprising on
both the top and bottom lines. Investors appear to be relieved
that results are not as bad as feared.”  
 ABB, the world’s largest builder of electricity networks,
advanced 2.7 percent to 21.58 Swiss francs and Adecco, the
biggest supplier of temporary workers, increased 4.7 percent to
55.60 francs.  
 Banks Advance  
 Banking shares were the second-best performers in Europe
today as BNP Paribas, France’s largest lender, reported earnings
that topped estimates, while HSBC Holdings Plc said first-half
pretax profit more than doubled to $11.1 billion.  
 UBS climbed 1.7 percent to 18.10 francs, while Credit
Suisse advanced 3.8 percent to 49.24 francs.  Julius Baer Group
Ltd. , the 120-year-old Swiss private bank, increased 3 percent
to 37.53 francs.  
 Swiss Life, Switzerland’s biggest life insurer, rose 2.2
percent to 111.90 francs. UBS lifted its stance on the European
insurance industry to “neutral” from “small underweight.”  
 Xstrata surged 5.7 percent to 17.65 francs as basic-
resources producers gained 4.2 percent. Metal prices rose as a
rally in equities boosted investor confidence that the global
economic recovery is gaining momentum.  
 Straumann Gains  
 Straumann Holding AG  rose 1.7 percent to 232.10 francs.
BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research reinitiated coverage of the
maker of dental implants with a “buy” recommendation and a
price estimate of 270 francs, saying in a note that “Straumann
currently enjoys encouraging sales momentum driven by a strong
product cycle, market share gains and a recovering dental
implant market.”  
 Kuoni Reisen Holding AG  rose 6.2 percent to 344.25 francs.
The largest Swiss travel company plans to sell part of its visa-
facilitation unit, VFS Global, through an initial public
offering in Mumbai in the autumn, NZZ am Sonntag reported,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.
