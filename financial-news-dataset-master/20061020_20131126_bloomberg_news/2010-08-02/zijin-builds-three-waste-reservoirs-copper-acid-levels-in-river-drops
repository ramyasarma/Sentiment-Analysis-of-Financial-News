             Zijin Mining Group Co. , the Chinese
gold producer blamed for the industry’s worst metal leakage in
two years, completed building three out of four waste reservoirs
as part of the reparation works for the July 3 accident.  
 Environmental authorities took 61 samples of the Shanghang
section of the Ting River, where the acidic copper waste from
Zijin’s plant had leaked into, and found that the copper and
acid content were back to normal levels, Zijin said in a
 statement  on its website dated July 31.  
 Zijin was forced to shut its copper plant at Zijinshan mine
in Fujian province last month after waste spilled from the site,
poisoning almost 2,000 metric tons of fish in the Ting River.
Police detained four managers of Zijin, and the company is being
probed over the disclosure of the incident by regulators.
