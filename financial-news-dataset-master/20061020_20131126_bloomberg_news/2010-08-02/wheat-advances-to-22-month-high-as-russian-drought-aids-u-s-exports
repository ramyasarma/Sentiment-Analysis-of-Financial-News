             Wheat jumped to a 22-month high after
the hottest July in Russia in 130 years withered crops, eroding
a global surplus and boosting demand for shipments from the
U.S., the world’s biggest exporter. Rice and oats also climbed.  
 In July, wheat prices had the biggest monthly gain since
1973. Hot, dry weather in Kazakhstan and the European Union and
floods in Canada also hurt crops. The Hydrometeorological Center
of Russia said temperatures in the nation’s center will reach 42
degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit) through Aug. 7.
Russia’s harvest may fall 28 percent, SovEcon said July 27.  
 “People have been caught off guard by the extent of the
crop problems,” said  Greg Grow , the director of agribusiness
for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery surged 31.75 cents, or
4.8 percent, to close at $6.9325 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $7.1125, the
highest level since Sept. 29, 2008. The most-active contract
gained 38 percent in July.  
 Russian grain exports may fall as low as 11 million metric
tons in the year that started July 1, under a “worst-case
scenario,” from 21.5 million tons last year, the country’s
Grain Union said today. Shipments will be 14 million tons under
“normal” conditions, it said.  
 The U.S. and  Australia  are expected to boost wheat exports
in the year that began July 1 to fill a gap left by fewer
shipments from Russia, the International Grains Council said
last week.  
 The  U.S.  will ship an estimated 28.5 million metric tons,
up 24 percent from a year earlier and 4.4 million tons more than
forecast last month, the council said.  
 Yesterday, Egypt agreed to buy 180,000 tons from Russia.  
 ‘Last for a While’  
 “Some believe this may be the last Russian sales for a
while,” Grow said. “No one knows how much this market will
rally, and that has limited commercial selling interest.”  
 Rice futures for September delivery rose 13.5 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $10.69 per 100 pounds. Earlier, the price reached
$11.055, the highest level since June 24.  
 Oat futures for December delivery gained 5.5 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $2.895 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached $2.97,
the highest level since Oct. 14, 2008.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
