             Rockets hit the adjacent port cities
of Aqaba in southern Jordan and Eilat in Israel, wounding four
people in Jordan.  
 One person was seriously injured and three others suffered
minor wounds when a rocket landed in front of a hotel in Aqaba
at 7:45 a.m. local time today, according to  Ali Al Ayed ,
Jordan’s minister of information. “The rocket was launched from
outside Jordanian territory and security forces are
investigating the incident,” the state-run Petra news agency
quoted Ayed as saying.  
 A number of explosions were reported in the Eilat area at
the same time and no injuries or damage were reported, the
Israeli army said in an e-mailed statement.  
 In April, three rockets were fired at Eilat and one hit a
warehouse in Aqaba, the Israeli army said in its statement. In
August 2005, both Aqaba and Eilat were struck by rockets fired
from Jordanian territory.  
 Egyptian officials said today’s rocket salvo didn’t
originate from the country’s Sinai desert area that borders
Eilat, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported without
identifying the officials. Israeli television’s Channel 2
reported that the rockets may have been fired from Sinai.
