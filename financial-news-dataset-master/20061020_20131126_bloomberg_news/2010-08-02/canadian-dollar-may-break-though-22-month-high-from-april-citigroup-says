             Canada’s dollar may be poised to
break through the 22-month high reached in April and trade
stronger parity versus its U.S. counterpart, according to
technical analysis from Citigroup Inc.  
 The firm advised betting the loonie rises against the U.S.
dollar at C$1.0242, with a stop-loss order at C$1.0400, and with
a target of new lows in a move below 99.31 U.S. cents.      
 The currency reached 99.31 U.S. cents on April 21, the
highest in 22 months. The Canadian dollar appreciated 0.9
percent to C$1.0207 per U.S. dollar at 10:21 a.m. in New York,
from C$1.0297 on July 30. Markets in Canada are closed today for
a holiday.
