             South Korea’s won advanced to its
strongest level in six weeks after exports last month increased
more than economists forecast. Bonds rose.  
 The currency strengthened for a second day as the MSCI
Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares climbed. Government data
released on Aug. 1 showed  overseas shipments  gained 29.6 percent
from a year earlier, compared with the median forecast for a
27.4 percent increase in a Bloomberg News survey. Imports rose
28.9 percent, resulting in a trade surplus of $5.7 billion.  
 “We should see further won gains, given the continuing
strength in net exports, which remain very robust,” said
 Christian Carrillo , a Tokyo-based senior rates strategist at
Societe Generale SA. “The only element blocking further
currency appreciation appears to be central bank intervention.”  
 The won appreciated 0.8 percent to 1,173.23 per dollar as
of 9:30 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached 1,172.85, the highest level since June 21.  
 The won weakened on July 28, snapping a six-day rally, as
traders said the Bank of Korea bought the dollar to counter
gains that may hurt exports, which account for about half of
South Korea’s gross domestic product. Central banks intervene in
currency markets by arranging purchases or sales of foreign
exchange.  
 Bonds rose after data released today showed inflation last
month stayed within the central bank’s target. The  consumer
price index  gained 2.6 percent from a year earlier, the
statistics office said, matching the increase in June and the
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The Bank of
Korea is targeting an inflation rate between 2 percent and 4
percent on average through 2012.  
 The yield on the 3.75 percent security due in June 2013
fell two basis points to 3.79 percent. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.
