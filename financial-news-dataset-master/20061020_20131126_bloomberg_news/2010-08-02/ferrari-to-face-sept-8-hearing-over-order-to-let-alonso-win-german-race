             Ferrari will face a disciplinary
hearing four days before next month’s Italian Grand Prix after
 Felipe Massa  appeared to be given coded orders to let  Fernando Alonso  win last month’s race in Germany.  
 The Federation Internationale de l’Automobile, Formula
One’s governing body, said last night that its World Motor Sport
Council will conduct the hearing on Sept. 8 in Paris.  
 Race stewards fined the team $100,000 after the July 25
German Grand Prix for breaking a rule stating that “team orders
which interfere with a race result are prohibited.” The council
could impose further sanctions, including a points deduction or
expulsion from the championship.  
 Ferrari was also charged with breaching a regulation
relating to “fraudulent conduct or any act prejudicial to the
interests of any competition or to the interests of motor sport
generally.”  
 Massa was leading with a third of the race to go at
Hockenheim when Ferrari race engineer Roy Smedley told him over
the team radio: “Fernando is faster than you. Can you confirm
you understand?’’ Soon after, Alonso moved past the Brazilian
driver. Then came another radio message to Massa: “Good lad,
just stick with it now. Sorry.”  
 Stefano Domenicali , Ferrari’s team principal, denied
breaking the rules after the race, saying his team was
“confident that the World Council will know how to evaluate the
overall facts correctly.”  
 Team orders have been banned in Formula One since 2002.
