             China’s manufacturing grew at the
slowest pace in 17 months in July as the government clamped down
on property speculation and investment in energy-intensive and
polluting factories.  
 The  Purchasing Managers’ Index  fell to 51.2 from 52.1 in June,
the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said on its website
yesterday. A reading above 50 shows an expansion. A separate China
PMI is due today from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  
 A deeper Chinese slowdown could weaken a global recovery
already constrained by the debt burdens and unemployment of
advanced economies. While growth is cooling, China’s full-year
expansion may be as much as 9.5 percent, up from 9.1 percent in
2009, State Council researcher  Zhang Liqun  said yesterday.  
 China Automotive Technology & Research Center will announce
July figures for vehicle sales today.  
 The Ministry of Finance is scheduled to sell 28 billion yuan
($4.1 billion) of 10-year bonds and 10 billion yuan of 273-day
bills this week.  
 China’s stocks  dropped last week, paring the benchmark
index’s biggest monthly advance in a year, on concern recent gains
were excessive relative to earnings prospects.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, lost 10.61, or 0.4 percent, to 2,637.50
on Friday, declining 2.5 percent for the week. The  CSI 300 Index 
fell 0.3 percent to 2,868.85 on July 30, dropping 2.7 percent last
week.  
 Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. , the listed unit of China’s fourth-
biggest coal miner, slumped 3 percent on Friday after cutting its
earnings growth forecast.  Northeast Securities Co.  slid 1.2
percent after net income fell.  
 Yuan Forwards  
 Yuan forwards fell in July as traders stepped up bets China
will slow the pace of currency appreciation to support exporters.  
 The world’s third-biggest economy can consider a small yuan
depreciation to help stabilize export growth, the China Securities
Journal reported, citing central bank adviser  Zhou Qiren . The
yuan’s appreciation slowed to 0.1 percent against the dollar in
July, compared with a gain of 5.9 percent for the euro and 2.9
percent for the yen.  
 The 12-month non-deliverable yuan forward dropped 0.4 percent
to 6.6873 per dollar in Hong Kong on July 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contract reflected bets the currency
will advance 1.3 percent from the spot rate of 6.7750.
