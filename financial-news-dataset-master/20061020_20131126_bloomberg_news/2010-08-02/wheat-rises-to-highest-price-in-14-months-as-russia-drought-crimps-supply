             Wheat futures advanced, extending the
biggest monthly gain since Aug. 1973, on concern persistent dry
weather in Russia and other parts of Europe may curb global
supply.                                               
 Wheat for September delivery added as much as 1.5 percent
to $6.7125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest
price for the most-active contract since June 2, 2009. It
traded at $6.70 a bushel at 9:15 a.m. Singapore time.
