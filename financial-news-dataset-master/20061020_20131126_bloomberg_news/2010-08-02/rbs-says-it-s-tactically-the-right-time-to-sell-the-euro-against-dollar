             Investors should sell the euro
against the dollar amid risks that euro-region growth will start
to moderate, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said.  
 “It is tactically the right time to sell the euro,”  Greg Gibbs , a foreign-exchange strategist in Sydney, wrote today in a
report. “The risks are still biased toward less-impressive
growth in the euro-zone. Euro-zone periphery-government yield
spreads over bunds drifted wider on Thursday-Friday, perhaps a
further sign that the recovery in spreads has reached its
peak,” he said.  
 The euro strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.3075 as of 7:53
a.m. in London.
