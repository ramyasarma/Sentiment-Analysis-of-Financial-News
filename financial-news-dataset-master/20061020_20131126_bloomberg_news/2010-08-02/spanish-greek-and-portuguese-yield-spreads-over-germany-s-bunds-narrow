             The yield difference, or spread,
between bonds issued by the most indebted euro-region nations
and German government securities narrowed today.  
 The extra yield that investors demand for holding 10-year
Spanish bonds instead of benchmark German 10-year debt fell six
basis points to 148 basis points as of 10:25 a.m. in London. The
yield spread between Greek and German debt of the same maturity
narrowed four basis points to 759 basis points.  
 The Portuguese spread was two basis points tighter at 250
basis points.
