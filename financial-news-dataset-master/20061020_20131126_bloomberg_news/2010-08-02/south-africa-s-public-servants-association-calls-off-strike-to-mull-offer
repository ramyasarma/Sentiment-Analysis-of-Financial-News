             South Africa’s Public Servants
Association said it called off a strike while its members
consider a response to the government’s latest pay offer.  
 The strike will resume on Aug. 10 if the wage offer is not
improved, Manie de Clercq, deputy general of the PSA, said in a
telephone interview from Pretoria today.
