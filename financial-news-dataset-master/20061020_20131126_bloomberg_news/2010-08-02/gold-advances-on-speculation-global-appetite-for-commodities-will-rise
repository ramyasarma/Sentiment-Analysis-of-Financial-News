             Gold futures rose to a one-week high
on speculation that a growing global economy will boost demand
for raw materials.  
 Equities in Asia, Europe and the U.S. advanced, and the
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities extended a rally
to the highest level in almost three months. Before today, gold

June 21.  
 “Gold is inching its way back up,” said  Frank McGhee , the

“There’s talk of growth again, and gold is playing catch-up to
the industrial complex.”  
 Gold futures for December delivery gained $5.80, or 0.5
percent, to $1,189.70 at 10:47 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the metal reached $1,193.90, the highest level for a
most-active contract since July 26. Before today, the price

 The MSCI World Index of  equities  jumped to the highest
level since May 14. Crude oil topped $81 a barrel, and copper

 Hedge funds and other large  speculators  increased their
net-long position by 5.9 percent in Comex gold futures in the
week ended July 27, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. That marked the first increase in a month.  
 Demand increased in India, the biggest world’s biggest
importer, after prices dropped 5 percent in June.  
 “Metal continues to flow toward countries such as India
and Turkey in anticipation of a rise in seasonal demand,”
 Walter de Wet , the head of commodities research at Standard Bank
