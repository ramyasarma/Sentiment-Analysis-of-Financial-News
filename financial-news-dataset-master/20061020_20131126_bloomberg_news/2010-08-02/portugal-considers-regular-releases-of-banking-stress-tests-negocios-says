             The Bank of Portugal, the country’s
central bank, is considering “regularly” releasing results of
stress tests carried out on banks every six months, Jornal de
Negocios reported, citing an unidentified official at the Bank
of Portugal.  
 The tests carried out by the Bank of Portugal are “more
complete” than the European stress tests, the Portuguese
newspaper said.
