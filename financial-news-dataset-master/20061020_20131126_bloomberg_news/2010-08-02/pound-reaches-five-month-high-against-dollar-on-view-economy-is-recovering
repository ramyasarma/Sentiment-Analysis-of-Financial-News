             The pound rose to the highest level
in almost six months against the dollar on signs the U.K.
economy is recovering faster than some economists had forecast.  
 The British currency strengthened to the highest level in
almost four weeks versus the euro as a report showed U.K.
manufacturing expanded for a 10th straight month in July.
Futures traders cut their bets that the pound will decline
against the U.S. dollar, figures from the Washington-based
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission  showed on July 30. The FTSE
100 Index of shares climbed the most in more than a week.  
 “There was a lot of bad news in the price of sterling and
the economy is recovering,” said  Daragh Maher , deputy head of
global foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London. “The pound tends to benefit when
risk is put back on the table.”  
 The pound rose 1.3 percent to $1.5897 as of 5 p.m. in
London after earlier touching $1.5907, the highest level since
Feb. 4. Sterling appreciated 0.4 percent against the euro to
82.87 pence, after touching 82.55 pence, its strongest level
since July 5.  
 An index of  U.K. manufacturing  fell to a five-month low of
57.3 in July from 57.6 in June, the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply and Markit Economics said in a statement
in London today. Economists forecast a reading of 57, according
to the median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the pound compared with
those betting on a gain, so-called net shorts, was 17,940 on
July 2, compared with net shorts of 26,767 a week earlier.  
 Economic Reports  
 The pound has climbed 4.2 percent against the dollar since
the day before a July 23 report showed the  U.K. economy  grew
almost twice as much as economists forecast in the second
quarter.  
 British economic data has beaten economists’ expectations
since April, according to an index of economic surprises
compiled by Citigroup Inc. The index was at 72.5 on July 30,
down from an 11-month high of 119.3 on May 20.  
 The pound may reach $1.5970 should it breach a key
technical level, according to analysts at Commerzbank AG.
Sterling, which broke above its 200-day moving average last
week, “meets resistance at $1.5836, the top of its short-term
channel,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and
currency technical analysis in London, said today.  
 A sustained break above that level “targets $1.5970, the
61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the decline from $1.7044
in August 2009 to the May 2010 low at $1.4225,” Jones said in a
telephone interview. The pound last surpassed $1.5970 on Feb. 3.  
 Gilts Fall  
 U.K. government bonds fell, pushing the yield on the 10-
year gilt up three basis points to 3.35 percent. The 4.75
percent security due March 2020 dropped 0.245, or 2.45 pounds
per 1,000-pound face amount, to 111.405. Two-year yields also
climbed three basis points, to 0.8 percent.  
 Gilts returned 5.8 percent this year, compared with 6.3
percent for German bunds and 6.7 percent for U.S. Treasuries,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  
 The U.K. debt management office plans to sell 3.75 billion
pounds of 2.75 percent 2015 notes tomorrow. It last sold the
securities on June 2 when it attracted bids worth 2.34 times the
notes on offer at an average yield of 2.27 percent.
