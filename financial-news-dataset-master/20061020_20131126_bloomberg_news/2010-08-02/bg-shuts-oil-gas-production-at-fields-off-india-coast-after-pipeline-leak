             BG Group Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest gas producer, shut crude oil and natural gas output from
the Panna-Mukta fields off India’s west coast on July 20 after a
leak in a sub-sea pipeline.  
 The company halted about 35,000 barrels a day of oil and
205 million cubic feet a day of gas production, the company said
in an e-mail today. BG hasn’t decided when operations will
resume, according to the statement.  
 “Inclement weather conditions have caused the restoration
work to progress at a slow rate,” the company said in the
statement. “It is difficult to set a firm date for resuming
production.”  Reliance Industries Ltd. , India’s most valuable
company, and  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. , the country’s biggest
explorer, are BG’s partners in the field.  
 BG had previously shut the field on July 29, 2009, after a
leak in under-water pipelines, according to  Edel McCaffrey , a
U.K.-based spokeswoman at BG. Production was restarted after
two-weeks.
