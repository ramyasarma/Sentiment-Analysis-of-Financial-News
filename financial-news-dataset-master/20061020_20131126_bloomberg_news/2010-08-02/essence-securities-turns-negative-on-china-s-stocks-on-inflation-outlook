             Essence Securities Co., ranked second
for strategy research by New Fortune magazine last year, said
it’s turning “negative” on China’s stock market because of
inflation concerns.  
 The improvement in liquidity, which has already been
reflected in higher stock turnover, is waning, analyst Zhang Zhi
at Essence Securities wrote in a report today. The brokerage,
which previously had a “neutral” rating on China’s stocks,
recommended selling so-called cyclical stocks and companies with
high valuations and poor liquidity, according to the report.
