             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said
it isn’t in talks over the sale of Liverpool soccer team after
U.K. press reports that the bank was approached by a Chinese
businessman interested in buying the club.  
 Kenny Huang was reported in the U.K. press to have
contacted the government-controlled lender with a view to
guaranteeing repayment of 237 million pounds ($377 million) of
debt owed by Liverpool’s American co-owners  George Gillett Jr .
and  Tom Hicks . The reports were in newspapers today, including
the London-based Times, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail.  
 “We are not in talks with any bidders with regards to
Liverpool Football Club,” said  Piers Townsend , a spokesman for
RBS, in an interview.  
 The bank extended the owners’ credit facility after
Liverpool hired  British Airways Plc  Chairman  Martin Broughton 
in April to sell the 18-time English soccer champion. The
extension runs until early October.  
 Hicks has said he wants as much as 800 million pounds for
the club, which he and Gillett bought in 2007 for 219 million
pounds, including debt.  
 The Times said a group led by Huang, who’s head of
investment firm QSL Sports Ltd., aimed to take control of the
club. Huang declined to comment to Bloomberg News when
contacted through his Hong Kong-based spokeswoman Rachel Chan.
