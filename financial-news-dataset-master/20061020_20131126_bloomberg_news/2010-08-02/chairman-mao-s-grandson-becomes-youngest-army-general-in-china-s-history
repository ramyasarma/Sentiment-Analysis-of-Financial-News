             The grandson of Chairman  Mao Zedong ,
the first leader of the People’s Republic of China, has become
the country’s youngest army general, state-run media reported.  
 Photographs  of the portly  Mao Xinyu  wearing the  insignia  of
a major general, the lowest of three general ranks in the
People’s Liberation Army, were published on the Web site of
China News Service. Mao is the youngest person to hold that rank,
the Global Times reported today, citing Bao Guojun, a spokesman
at the Academy of Military Sciences, where Mao is stationed.  
 Mao’s grandfather led the Communist Party to victory over
the Nationalists in a decades-long struggle, ruling the country
from 1949 until his death in 1976. The younger Mao, who studies
his grandfather’s theory, is also a member of the advisory
committee to China’s parliament.  
 News reports about Mao’s promotion first appeared last year.
Mao was cited earlier this year by the China News Service as
saying that any formal announcement on the promotion would come
in July.  
 “Everyone is transferring their love for my grandfather to
me,” Mao was quoted by the Chinese News Service as saying
earlier this year.  
 The progeny of China’s revolutionary leaders often reach
high office. Vice President  Xi Jinping  is the son of former
Guangdong Governor Xi Zhongxun. Chongqing Communist Party
Secretary  Bo Xilai  is the son of former Politburo member Bo Yibo.
