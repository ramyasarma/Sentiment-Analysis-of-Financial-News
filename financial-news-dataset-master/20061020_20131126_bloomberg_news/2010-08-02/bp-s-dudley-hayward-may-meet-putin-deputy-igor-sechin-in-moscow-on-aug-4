             BP Plc  incoming Chief Executive
Officer  Robert Dudley  will arrive in Moscow this week and is
likely to meet with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s deputy,  Igor Sechin , on Aug. 4, said a government aide.  
 Dudley, who had worked for five years as CEO of the British
company’s venture with a group of Russian billionaires, will be
accompanied by outgoing chief  Tony Hayward , Sechin’s aide, who
declined to be identified, citing state policy, said by
telephone today. He declined to comment on the agenda.  
 TNK-BP, Russia’s third-biggest oil company, accounts for
about a quarter of BP’s production and a fifth of reserves. Two
years ago, Dudley, 54, left Russia, citing “sustained
harassment” during a battle for control between BP and its
partners.  
 BP spokesman  Vladimir Buyanov  said the executives plan to
come to Moscow to re-introduce Dudley to the government as CEO
and meet with business partners, given Russia’s importance to
the company. He declined to comment on the timing of the trip.  
 In March 2007, former BP CEO John Browne traveled to Moscow
to introduce his then successor Hayward to Putin.  
 Viktor Vekselberg , a billionaire shareholder in TNK-BP,
said July 29 that Dudley was expected to arrive in the middle of
this week, according to  Andrei Shtorkh , a spokesman for the
businessman’s Renova Group.  
 TNK-BP spokesman Nikolay Gorelov declined to comment in an
e-mailed response to questions.
