             Mitsui & Co. may take a charge of
several billion yen for the quarter ended in June related to
losses from BP Plc’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Nikkei
English News reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  
 The company holds a partial stake in the oil well through a
subsidiary of Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Nikkei reported.
Mitsui has decided to write off the investment because the well
is not expected to produce revenue in the future, Nikkei said.
