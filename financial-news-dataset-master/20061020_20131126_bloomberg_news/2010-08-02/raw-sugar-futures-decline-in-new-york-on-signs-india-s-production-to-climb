             Raw sugar declined from a four-month
high on concern that more rainfall in India will increase output
in the world’s second-biggest producer of the sweetener.  
 Rains  in July, the wettest month of the June-September
monsoon season, were 2.5 percent above the 50-year average,
aiding cane planting, according to the  India Meteorological
Department . The commodity climbed 22 percent last month on
increased demand from importing nations.  
 “People are worried if production is large in India, the
market may find itself a little heavy in the medium term,” said
 Ricardo Scaff , a trader at Rabobank International in New York.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery declined 0.17 cent, or 0.9
percent, to close at 19.4 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price climbed to 19.88 cents, the
highest level for a most-active contract since March 15.  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  increased 
their net-long position, or bets on higher prices in sugar
futures on ICE, by 3.9 percent in the week ended July 27 from a
week earlier, according to U.S. government data.  
 Refined-sugar futures for October delivery declined $14.20,
or 2.4 percent, to $571.50 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in
London.  
 Brazil is the world’s biggest sugar producer.
