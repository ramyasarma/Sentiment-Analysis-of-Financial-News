             German Finance Ministry spokesman
Martin Kreienbaum said the ministry has no intention to
“change” the solidarity surcharge on income and corporate
taxes. He made his comments in response to a reporter’s question
at a regular government press conference in Berlin today.  
 “We expect that the way it’s set up can’t be challenged in
constitutional terms,” Kreienbaum said.
