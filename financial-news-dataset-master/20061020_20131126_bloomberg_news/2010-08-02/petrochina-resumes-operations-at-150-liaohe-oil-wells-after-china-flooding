             PetroChina Co. , the nation’s largest
oil producer, restored about 10 percent of its daily crude
production at Liaohe field in northeastern China after heavy
rains shut more than 1,500 wells.  
 Operations at 150 wells had resumed as of July 29,
restoring output of about 500 metric tons a day, parent China
National Petroleum Corp. said in its online  newsletter  today.  
 Heavy rains have caused flooding and landslides that
destroyed almost 450,000 homes and more than 400,000 hectares of
farmland since the beginning of July, the Ministry of Civil
Affairs said on July 27. CNPC said the flooding had affected
more than 5,600 tons a day of production, or 41,378 barrels a
day. That’s equivalent to 1.8 percent of PetroChina’s daily
 output  last year.  
 PetroChina is taking steps to restore oil production at the
field that spans the provinces of Liaoning and Inner Mongolia,
according to CNPC.  
 Seventeen PetroChina gas service stations in neighboring
Jilin were inundated by floodwaters after the province was hit
by the heaviest rains in a century, CNPC said.  
 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , the country’s second-
largest oil producer, said on July 22 that it had shut some oil
wells in southern China because of flooding.
