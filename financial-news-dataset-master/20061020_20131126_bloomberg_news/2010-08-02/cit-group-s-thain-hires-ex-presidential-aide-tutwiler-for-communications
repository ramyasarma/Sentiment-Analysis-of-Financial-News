             CIT Group Inc.  hired  Margaret Tutwiler , a former aide to three U.S. presidents and Chief
Executive Officer  John A. Thain , to lead the lender’s
communications, marketing and government relations.  
 Tutwiler, 59, was senior vice president and head of global
communications and public affairs at Merrill Lynch & Co., where
Thain was CEO of the brokerage, according to a statement today
from New York-based CIT. Before that, she led global
communications and government relations at  NYSE Euronext , where
Thain was also CEO.  
 Thain, 55, has been restocking CIT’s senior ranks as part
of a plan to recover from last year’s bankruptcy. The turnaround
depends in part on persuading regulators to loosen curbs on the
company’s  banking unit  so that CIT, one of the biggest U.S.
lenders to small businesses, can get access to lower-cost funds.  
 During the presidency of  George W. Bush , Tutwiler was
undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.
She held several positions in the U.S. Department of State under
former President George H.W. Bush, and was a spokeswoman at the
U.S. Treasury Department and a deputy assistant for political
affairs under President  Ronald Reagan .  
 “Margaret’s extensive governmental affairs and
communications experience will play an important role as we look
to strengthen CIT’s brand identity,” Thain said in the
statement.
