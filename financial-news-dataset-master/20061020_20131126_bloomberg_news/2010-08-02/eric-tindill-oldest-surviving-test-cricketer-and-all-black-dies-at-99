             Eric Tindill, the only man to have
represented New Zealand at cricket and rugby’s elite Test level,
has died. He was 99.  
 Tindill passed away yesterday, the New Zealand Rugby Union
said in an e-mailed statement. At the time of his death he held
the record as the oldest surviving Test cricketer at 99 years,
228 days, New Zealand Cricket said.  
 A left-handed batsman and wicketkeeper, Tindill played five
cricket Tests for New Zealand between 1937 and 1947. He also
represented the All Blacks rugby team 17 times between 1935 and
1938, making his only Test appearance in a 13-0 loss to England
in 1936. He went on to referee at Test level in both sports.  
 “Eric was a great servant to sport in this country, and as
a double All Black, reached the very pinnacle of sporting
performance in this country,”  Justin Vaughan , chief executive
officer of New Zealand Cricket, said in a statement. “His
achievements as a player in many sports, umpire and referee, as
well as other amazing deeds reads like a Boys Own story.”
