             EEMS Italia SpA, which assembles
and tests memory chips, climbed in Milan to the highest in more
than three months after the company sold its Singapore
subsidiary for $68 million in cash.  
 EEMS will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt and
finance its growth, it said in a statement distributed by the
Italian exchange today.  
 EEMS rose as much as 12 percent to 1.662 euros in Milan and
was trading at 1.643, up 11 percent, at 11:12 a.m.
