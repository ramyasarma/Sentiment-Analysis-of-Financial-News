             Randgold Resources Ltd. revised down
its production guidance for the Loulo gold mine in Mali
following a “difficult” quarter, in which output was hurt by
power outages.  
 Loulo’s 2010 output will still be within 5 percent to 10
percent of the original 400,000-ounce forecast and the mine’s
processing throughput will be back at planned levels by the
fourth quarter, the company said.
