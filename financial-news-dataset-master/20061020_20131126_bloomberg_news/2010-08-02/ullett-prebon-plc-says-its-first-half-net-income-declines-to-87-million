             Tullett Prebon Plc , a London-based
inter-dealer broker, said first-half profit fell 8.3 percent as
the company lost staff to rival BGC Partners Inc. and suffered a
“slightly adverse” effect from currency fluctuations.  
 Net income declined to 55.1 million pounds ($86.7 million)
from 60.1 million pounds a year earlier, the broker said in an
e-mailed statement today. Revenue dropped 8 percent to 475.8
million pounds.  
 “The world’s financial markets remained unsettled during
the first half with bouts of intense volatility,” Chief
Executive Officer  Terry Smith  said in the statement. “It is
likely that the unsettled financial-market conditions will
persist into the second half.”  
 Inter-dealer brokers such as Tullett act as a go-between
for banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies, energy and
derivatives. They typically handle more trades between banks
during periods of greater market volatility.  
 Tullett, which split off from U.K. stockbroker Collins
Stewart in 2006, competes against  ICAP Plc , the biggest broker
of transactions between banks. It will pay an interim dividend
of 5.25 pence a share.
