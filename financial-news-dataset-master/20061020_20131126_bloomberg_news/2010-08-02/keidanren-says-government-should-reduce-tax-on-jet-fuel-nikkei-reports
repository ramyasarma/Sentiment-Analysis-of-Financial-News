             The Japan Business Federation, or
Nippon Keidanren, will ask the country’s government to end or
reduce an airplane fuel tax, Nikkei English News reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 A cut in the tax on jet fuel used in Japanese domestic
routes may reduce airfare costs, Nikkei said.
