             China’s Ministry of Land and
Resources has found 1,457 unused plots of land nationwide and
given a list of what companies hold rights to these plots to the
China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities
Journal reported today, citing a person familiar with the
situation.  
 The banking regulator will use the list to conduct a risk
assessment, the Beijing-based newspaper reported. About 80
percent of the unused plots may be repossessed by the
government, according to the report.  
 The provinces of Hainan, Jiangsu and the cities of Beijing
and Guangzhou have the most unused land, accounting for almost a
fourth of all the unused plots, the newspaper reported.

     Wong also discusses the Asia-Pacific economy, the company's earnings and Hong Kong's property market. HSBC said first-half net income doubled as the North American unit returned to profit for the first time in three years and as bad-debt provisions fell by 46 percent.
