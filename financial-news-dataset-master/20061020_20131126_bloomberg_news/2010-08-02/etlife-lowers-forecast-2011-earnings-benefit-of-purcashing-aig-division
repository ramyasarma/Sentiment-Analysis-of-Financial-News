             MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. life
insurer, lowered its forecast for the 2011 benefit of purchasing
a non-U.S. unit from American International Group Inc.  
 The acquisition will add 40 cents to 45 cents to 2011
operating earnings per share, New York-based MetLife said today
in a regulatory filing. That compares with a projection of 45
cents to 55 cents in March, when the company announced the deal.
