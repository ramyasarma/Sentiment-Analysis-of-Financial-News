             China’s current daily yuan-dollar
trading band is “appropriate,” Hu Xiaolian, a deputy governor
at the People’s Bank of China, said in an interview with Century
Weekly magazine.  
 The trading band may be widened in the future, the magazine
cited Hu as saying. There is not timetable for exchange rate
reform, Hu was cited as saying.
