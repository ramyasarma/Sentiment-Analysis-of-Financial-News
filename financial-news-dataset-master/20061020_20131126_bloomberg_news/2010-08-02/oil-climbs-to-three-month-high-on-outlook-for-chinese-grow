             Crude oil surged above $81 a barrel
for the first time since May as a rally in global equity markets
increased speculation the economy is strengthening.  
 Oil jumped 3 percent after equities climbed on better-than-
expected earnings and as the Institute for Supply Management’s
U.S. manufacturing gauge fell less than forecast. The dollar
dropped against the euro, boosting the investment appeal of
commodities.  
 “Oil is following the S&P 500,” said  Adam Sieminski ,
chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Washington.
“Fundamentals don’t seem to matter. You don’t need to be an oil
analyst anymore. You just need to be a stock market analyst.”  
 Crude oil for September delivery rose $2.39 to $81.34 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since May 4. Futures climbed 4.4 percent in July, the
biggest monthly gain since March. Prices are up 17 percent from
a year ago.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  increased 2.2 percent to
1,125.68 as of 3:02 p.m. in New York following positive earnings
reports from companies such as  Humana Inc . and  Oshkosh Corp . It
jumped 6.9 percent in July, the biggest monthly advance since
July 2009. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  strengthened 210.18,
or 2 percent, to 10,676.12.  
 The  MSCI World Index , a gauge of equities in 24 developed
nations, rose 2.4 percent to 1,151.55, the highest level since
May 13. European stocks climbed to a three-month high on gains
among banks and basic-resource producers.  
 “Equities did well in July and profits are generally OK,
so people are feeling bullish across the board,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in
Winchester, Massachusetts.  
 Manufacturing Index  
 The ISM’s manufacturing gauge  fell  to 55.5 in July from
56.2 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said.
Economists had forecast the measure would drop to 54.5,
according to the median of 74 projections in a Bloomberg News
survey. Estimates ranged from 52.5 to 56. A reading greater than
50 points to expansion.  
 The dollar weakened by 0.9 percent to $1.3172 per euro from
$1.3052 on July 30 in New York.  
 The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities advanced
0.9 percent to 276.85, the strongest level since May 3. Thirteen
of the commodities increased, led by wheat, nickel, heating oil,
crude and gasoline.  
 Chinese Manufacturing  
 Oil also advanced on speculation that China’s government
will reverse policies aimed at slowing growth in the world’s
largest energy-consuming country. Indexes of Chinese
manufacturing dropped to the lowest level in more than a year,
two reports showed today.  
 A purchasing managers’ index, released today by  HSBC
Holdings Plc  and Markit Economics, slid to 49.4 from 50.4 in
June. A separate, government-backed PMI fell to 51.2 from 52.1,
the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing reported yesterday.
Fifty is the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  
 The U.S. has plans for “military options” it can use to
stop Iran, the second-largest oil producer in OPEC, from
developing nuclear weapons, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff said yesterday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  
 “The military options have been on the table and remain on
the table,” Admiral  Michael Mullen  said in an interview on the
program. “I hope we don’t get into that, but it’s an important
option and it’s one that’s well understood.”  
 Iran pumped 3.73 million barrels a day of oil in July, 13
percent of OPEC’s total output last month, according to
Bloomberg estimates. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which provides
about 40 percent of the world’s oil.  
 Brent Oil  
 Brent crude for September settlement gained $2.64, or 3.4
percent, to $80.82 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  
 “The question is whether oil is having a false break, as
fundamentals are not yet sufficiently robust to sustain prices
in the $80 area,” said  Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at
Bache Commodities Ltd. in London.  
 U.S. oil supplies probably fell 1.5 million barrels in the
seven days ended July 30 from 360.8 million a week earlier,
according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey. Inventories dropped as imports decreased and
refineries cut operating rates, the survey showed. Eight
respondents forecast a decline and three said there was a gain.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 503,717
contracts as of 3:02 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 449,568
contracts July 30, 35 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.22 million contracts, the
lowest level since July 20.
