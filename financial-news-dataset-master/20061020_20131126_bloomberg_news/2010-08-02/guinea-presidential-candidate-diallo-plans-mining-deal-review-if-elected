             Guinea presidential candidate Cellou
Dalein Diallo, who got the most votes in the first round of
voting in June, plans a review of mining deals made in the West
African nation if he wins a second ballot.  
 Diallo would review the agreements “to make sure that the
interests of Guinea were defended,” the candidate told reporters
in the capital, Conakry, yesterday. He declined to give further
details.  
 Guinea, the world’s biggest bauxite producer, began
reviewing mining deals in late 2008, Mines Minister  Mahmoud Thiam  said June 24. Companies including  United Co. Rusal , the
world’s largest aluminum producer, and  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. ,
Africa’s biggest gold producer, operate in the country.  
 Former Prime Minister Diallo, who received 43.7 percent of
votes in the June 27 first round, will face  Alpha Conde , who
received 18.3 percent, in a run-off election. No date has been
set, though Diallo said the vote could be Aug. 22 “at the
latest.”  
 Guinea’s  electoral commission  proposed last week the run-
off be held on Aug. 14, though spokesman Thierno Saidou Bayo
said the commission wanted the candidates to agree on the date.
