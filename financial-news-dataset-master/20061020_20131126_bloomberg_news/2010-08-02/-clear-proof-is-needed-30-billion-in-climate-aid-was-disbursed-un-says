             Developed countries must give “clear
proof” they’ve started disbursing $30 billion of climate aid
that they pledged last year to poorer nations, the new United
Nations climate chief said.  
 Evidence of payment will be needed at the UN’s annual end-
of-year climate negotiations in Cancun in November and December,
 Christiana Figueres  said at a briefing today as a week of talks
started in Bonn. About $10 billion should be paid out this year,
a third of the total which covered the years 2010, 2011 and
2012, she said.  
 “Developing nations see this as a critical signal of
industrialized nations’ willingness to progress,” said
Figueres, the diplomat leading talks organized by the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change. “Parties must come to
Cancun with a clear proof of having disbursed. Disbursement is
already occurring and they will report on that. They will then
have to elucidate on what they’ll do the next two years.”  
 Belgian delegate Peter Wittoeck, speaking for the 27-member
European Union, said the bloc is prepared to report on progress
at the Cancun meeting. The group of countries has promised to
contribute 7.2 billion euros ($9.4 billion) over the three years
through 2012.  
 Costa Rica’s Figueres on July 8 replaced Dutchman  Yvo de Boer  of the Netherlands as executive secretary of the UNFCCC
after climate talks in December in Copenhagen ended without
success.
