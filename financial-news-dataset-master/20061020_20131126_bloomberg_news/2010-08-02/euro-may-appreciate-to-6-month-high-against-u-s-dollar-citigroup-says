             The euro may climb to $1.39 this
month for the first time since February as Europe’s sovereign
debt crisis stabilizes and the Federal Reserve moves closer to
providing additional stimulus, according to Citigroup Inc.  
 The 16-nation currency today broke through its “last”
area of resistance versus its U.S. counterpart at $1.3080 to
$1.3115, rising as much as 1.1 percent to a three-month high of
$1.3195. The euro traded close to $1.31 every day last week,
failing to close above the level.  
 The key break, and a close above the $1.31 level today, may
push the currency to its 200-day moving average of $1.3580 and
beyond it to $1.39, a level not seen since Feb. 4, said  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief technical analyst at Citigroup Inc. in New
York.  
 “The overall picture still looks very constructive,”
Fitzpatrick said in a telephone interview. “We’re looking at an
environment that’s a combination of a slightly weaker dollar,
it’s equity markets doing well, commodity markets doing well,
it’s a very pro-risk environment.”  
 The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.3174 at 2:55 p.m. in New
York. Its high today of $1.3195 was the strongest level since
May 4. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 2 percent and the
 Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of raw materials added 0.9 percent.  
 Euro Path  
 The shared currency fell to a four-year low of $1.1877 on
June 6 amid investor concern that a sovereign debt crisis
started in Greece would spread to the rest of the region. A $750
billion euro ($988 trillion) fiscal package and the results of a
region-wide banking stress test, which found only 7 of 91
European Union banks failed, helped bolster confidence that the
region could resolve its debt problems.  
 The euro’s “stabilization” is illustrated by the recent
narrowing of the spread between bonds of debt-riddled nations,
such as Greece, and those of Germany, Fitzpatrick said.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year Greek debt
instead of similar-maturity benchmark German bunds narrowed to
749 basis points today from a high of 965 basis points reached
May 7. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity, currency
or index. A support level is an area on a chart where orders to
buy a currency versus a counterpart may be placed, potentially
blocking a decline. Resistance is the opposite, and an advance
above those levels typically indicates further gains.
