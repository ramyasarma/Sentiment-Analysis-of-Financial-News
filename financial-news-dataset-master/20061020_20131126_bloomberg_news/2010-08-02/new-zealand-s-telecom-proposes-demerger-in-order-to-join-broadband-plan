             Telecom Corp. , New Zealand’s largest
telephone company, said it’s prepared to demerge in order to
partner with the government in a national broadband plan.  
 “Our proposal is predicated on the structural separation
of Telecom through a demerger into two companies which would
give rise to Chorus2 as a new and entirely standalone company,”
Chief Executive Officer  Paul Reynolds  said in a statement.  
 The government has ruled that companies that want to join
its proposed NZ$1.5 billion ($1 billion) investment in a fiber-
optic network shouldn’t also offer retail services. Under a
demerger plan, Telecom would distribute stock in its network
company Chorus to existing shareholders.  
 Telecom today submitted its proposal for partnering in the
broadband plan to the government agency running the process. The
details are confidential, the Auckland-based company said.  
 The company in May said it was assessing whether to split
or to proceed with its own broadband plan in competition with
the government’s program. The  stock  rose 3 cents to NZ$2.20 at
3:40 p.m. in Wellington trading.  
 Reynolds said his proposal avoids duplication and aligns
the company’s interests with those of the government, which
wants to deliver faster Internet services to schools, businesses
and homes to speed economic growth.
