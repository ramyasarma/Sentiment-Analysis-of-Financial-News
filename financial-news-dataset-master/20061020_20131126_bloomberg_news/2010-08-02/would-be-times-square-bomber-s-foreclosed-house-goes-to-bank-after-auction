             The former Connecticut home of  Faisal Shahzad , who tried unsuccessfully to detonate a car bomb in New
York’s Times Square in May, became the property of his lender
after a public foreclosure auction over the weekend.  
 Nobody stepped forward to top the $227,400 bid submitted by
Chase Home Finance for Shahzad’s former home in  Shelton , a city
of about 38,000 people about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast
of Manhattan, before an auction held outside the residence on
July 31, said George Temple, an attorney appointed by
Connecticut Superior Court to handle the sale.  
 About three interested parties showed up for the auction on
the property of the 1,356-square-foot, three-bedroom Colonial,
Temple said. Shahzad bought the home in 2004 for $273,000, and
added his wife’s name to the deed in 2007, according to the
Shelton  assessor’s office . The residence was assessed at about
$243,000.  
 Shahzad left Connecticut in June 2009 for Pakistan, and his
wife and two children followed him, he told a U.S. judge in
Manhattan while pleading guilty last month. Chase Home Finance
sued him and his wife for foreclosure in September, and the
court on May 28 ordered the house sold at auction, court records
show.  
 Shahzad told the judge he returned to the U.S. in February
and rented a home in Bridgeport, about nine miles southwest of
Shelton, where he made the bomb that he drove into Times Square
on May 1.  
 A vehicle containing an improvised bomb was found smoking
on the street. Shahzad was arrested at New York’s John F.
Kennedy International Airport on May 3 after boarding a flight
to Dubai. He pleaded guilty to 10 terrorism-related charges and
faces a mandatory life prison term at his sentencing Oct. 5.  
 The criminal case is U.S. v. Shahzad, 10-00928, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
