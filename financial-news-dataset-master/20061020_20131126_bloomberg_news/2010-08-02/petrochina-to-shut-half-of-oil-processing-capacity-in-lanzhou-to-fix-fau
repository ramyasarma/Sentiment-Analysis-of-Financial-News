             PetroChina Co. , the country’s second-
biggest oil refiner, plans to shut almost half of the processing
capacity of its Lanzhou plant next week to repair a fault at a
secondary unit, a refinery official said.  
 The plant’s 3 million metric-ton-a-year catalytic cracker
will be closed for about 15 to 20 days from Aug. 10 for repairs,
the official said by phone from the refinery, declining to be
named because of company rules. The plant will shut its 5
million ton-a-year crude distillation unit accordingly, he said.  
 The refinery has two crude distillation units with a total
capacity of 10.5 million tons a year. The distillation units
heat up crude and separate it into oil products, while a
catalytic cracker upgrades the products separated by the process
to get higher-value fuels including gasoline.  
 The plant in the northwestern province of Gansu will step
up production for the rest of the year to meet its annual
processing target of 10.5 million tons, or 77.6 million barrels,
the official said.  
 PetroChina’s refineries processed a total of 829 million
barrels of crude last year, according to its  annual report .
