             The shortfall in India’s monsoon,
the main source of irrigation for the nation’s 235 million
farmers, narrowed to 3 percent as of yesterday, the weather
office said.  
 The nation received 451.8 millimeters of rain in the June
1-Aug. 1 period, compared with the 50-year average of 465.4
millimeters, the India Meteorological Department said on its
website. The monsoon was 16 percent below normal in June.  
 Rainfall is 1 percent above average in northwest
India, including Uttar Pradesh, and normal in central states
including Madhya Pradesh, the agency said. Madhya Pradesh is
India’s biggest soybean growing province, while Uttar Pradesh is
the nation’s biggest sugar cane grower.  
 Rainfall is 16 percent above average in south Indian
states, including the main coffee and rubber growing states, and
21 percent below normal in the northeastern states, which mainly
grows rice and tea, the agency said.
