             Honda Motor Co. , Japan’s second-
largest automaker, gained the most in seven weeks in Tokyo
trading after raising its full-year  profit forecast  on improving
sales in Asia.  
 Honda  rose 4 percent to close at 2,818 yen, the most since
June 14, after earlier  climbing as much as  4.9 percent. The
carmaker expects  net income  of 455 billion yen ($5.3 billion) in
the year ending March, compared with an earlier estimate of 340
billion yen, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement after
trading closed on July 30.  
 The maker of Accord sedans expects to sell 3.64 million
vehicles this fiscal year, compared with an earlier estimate of
3.615 million, with gains in Asia outside Japan accounting for
the increase.  Honda’s net income  in the three months ended June
30 surged to 272.49 billion yen, more than double analyst
estimates, from 7.56 billion yen a year earlier.  
 Honda  “revised up first-half operating profit well beyond
Deutsche Bank’s estimate,”  Kurt Sanger , an auto analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG in Tokyo, wrote in a report today. First-
quarter operating profit “far exceeded our expectations,” said
Sanger, who  rates  the stock “buy.”  
 Honda , the world’s biggest motorcycle maker, also raised
its two-wheeler sales forecast to 10.82 million vehicles from
10.38 million.  
 Stronger Yen  
 The company’s  operating profit  may be eroded by 80 billion
yen as the Japanese currency gains more than previously forecast,
Honda said. The automaker based its full-year profit estimate on
exchange rates of 87 yen to the U.S. dollar and 112 yen to the
euro. In April, Honda expected the currency to average 90
against the dollar and 120 against the euro.  
 A rising yen against the two currencies reduces the
repatriated value of earnings from sales in the U.S. and Europe.  
 A revamped Odyssey minivan and better inventory management
of CR-V, Pilot and Fit models will help sales in the U.S., Honda
Executive Vice President  Koichi Kondo  said on July 30.  
 Honda’s deliveries in North America, its most profitable
market, rose 15 percent in the first quarter as the U.S. economy
recovered, while Japan sales jumped 13 percent on government
subsidies for car buyers. Sales in other Asian countries surged
38 percent.  
 Higher factory utilization cut fixed costs by 40 billion
yen in the three-month period, Kondo said.  
 The carmaker’s first-quarter output in China rose 4.3
percent to 149,109 units, even as its sales in the country fell
2.4 percent in June after  strikes  at suppliers forced the
carmaker to halt production.
