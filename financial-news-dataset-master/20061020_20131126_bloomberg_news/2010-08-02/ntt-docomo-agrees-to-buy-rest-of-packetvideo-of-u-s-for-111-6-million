             NTT DoCoMo Inc. , Japan’s largest
mobile-phone operator, will pay $111.6 million to buy the shares
of U.S. wireless software company PacketVideo Corp. it doesn’t
own to help bolster its data services.  
 DoCoMo, which last year bought a stake of about 35 percent
in PacketVideo for $45.5 million, has reached an agreement with
NextWave Wireless Inc. to buy the remaining shares, the Tokyo-
based company said in a statement today.  
 The Japanese carrier already uses PacketVideo’s technology
to offer music and video on mobile phones and expects the
purchase to help develop services for faster, more efficient
Long Term Evolution, or LTE, wireless technology, DoCoMo
spokeswoman  Makiko Furuta  said by phone today. DoCoMo plans to
complete the transaction in the quarter ending Sept. 30, it said.  
 DoCoMo is investing 300 billion yen ($3.5 billion) over
three years in its LTE network and plans to begin services on
computer cards in December, President  Ryuji Yamada  said last
month. The technology allows for transmission speeds comparable
to those of a fiber-optic connection and a more efficient use of
the wireless spectrum.  
 Shares of  DoCoMo  rose 0.2 percent to 137,800 yen as of the
11 a.m. break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average added 1.2 percent.
