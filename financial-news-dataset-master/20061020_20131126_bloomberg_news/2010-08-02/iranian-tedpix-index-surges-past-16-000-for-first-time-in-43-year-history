             The  Tehran Stock Exchange  said its
benchmark Tedpix index, the world’s second-best performing
equity index in the first half of 2010, exceeded 16,000 for the
first time in its 43-year history.  
 The index closed at 16,078 today, up from 12,536 since March
17, the last business day in the previous Iranian year, according
to the TSE’s website.  
 The exchange, founded in 1967, lists 337 companies with a
total value of 759 trillion Iranian rials ($76 billion). An
average of 9,886 trades were completed per day in the Iranian
month of Khordad, which ended June 21, according to data on the
exchange’s website.  
 Investors in emerging markets have received better returns
than those in Europe and the U.S. over the last year. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index rose 16 percent in the past 12 months,
compared with a gain of 10 percent in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 14 percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The Tedpix
surged 55 percent, making it the second-best performer in the
first half, according to the  World Federation of Exchanges .  
 The TSE is a member of the  Federation of Euro-Asian Stock
Exchanges  and the World Federation of Exchanges.
