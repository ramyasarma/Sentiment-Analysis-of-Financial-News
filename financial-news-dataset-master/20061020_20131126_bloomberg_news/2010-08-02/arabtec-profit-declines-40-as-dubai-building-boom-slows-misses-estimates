             Arabtec Holding PJSC , the United Arab
Emirates’ biggest construction company by market value, reported
a 40 percent decline in second-quarter profit as the building
boom in Dubai slowed after the global financial crisis.  
 Net income dropped to 111.1 million dirhams ($30 million),
or 11 fils a share, from 183.9 million dirhams, or 15 fils, a
year earlier, Arabtec said in a  statement to  the Dubai bourse
today. The average estimate of six analysts was for a profit of
144 million dirhams, according to  data compiled  by Bloomberg.
Revenue in the quarter fell to 1.28 billion dirhams from 2
billion dirhams, the company said.  
 Building companies in Dubai are struggling after property
developers halted or canceled projects costing billions of
dollars because of falling prices. Nakheel PJSC began in June
making 40 percent cash payment payments to its contractors as
the Dubai World-owned company seeks to alter terms on $10.5
billion of unpaid bills and loans.  
 Aabar Investments PJSC , an Abu Dhabi government-controlled
company, in April canceled a plan to buy most of Arabtec for an
estimated $1.74 billion. The two companies are still working
toward a strategic partnership, Arabtec Chief Executive Officer
 Riad Kamal  said May 24.  
 Arabtec’s contract to build a skyscraper for  OAO Gazprom  in
St. Petersburg faces popular protest. The uncertainty about the
10 billion-dirham project is “not a positive development” for
the company, Deutsche Bank AG said in a report on May 25.
Arabtec in June won three contracts in Abu Dhabi with total
value of 747 million dirhams to build industrial facilities. The
company is also seeking orders in North Africa, Turkmenistan,
Azerbaijan and Angola.  
 Arabtec shares rose 1.1 percent to 1.77 dirhams at 10:13 in
Dubai trading. The stock has lost 34 percent this year.
