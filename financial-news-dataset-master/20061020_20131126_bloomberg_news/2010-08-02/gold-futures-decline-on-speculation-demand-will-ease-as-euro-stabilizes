             Gold futures fell, extending a
decline in July that was the biggest in seven months, as a
rebound in the euro eased demand for the precious metal as an
alternative to the currency.  
 The euro rose as much as 1.1 percent against the dollar,
touching the highest level since May 5. Before today, gold
futures increased 8 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,266.50 an ounce on June 21. The metal also climbed to all-
time highs in euros on June 7 amid Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis.  
 “On the rallies, you’ve got some investors moving out of
gold and back into euros,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer
at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago. “It’s the
continuation of the unwinding of the long-gold, short-euro
trade.”  
 Gold futures for December delivery fell $1.50, or 0.1
percent, to $1,182.40 at 12:02 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices fell 5 percent in July.
