             Colombia’s peso rose to its strongest
level since October on speculation increased dollar inflows into
the South American country will continue to push gains in the
local currency.  
 The peso climbed 0.6 percent to 1,832.40 per U.S. dollar at
3:57 p.m. New York time, from 1,843.5 on July 30. That’s its
strongest level on a closing basis since Oct. 14. The peso has
jumped 12 percent this year, the best performance among 31 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “We continue to see real investment flows into Colombia,”
said Daniel Velandia, head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage
Correval SA. “There’s also rising appetite from foreigners”
for local financial assets, he said.  
 The central bank’s failure to announce measures to ease
gains in the peso in the July 23 monetary policy meeting is also
helping gains in the currency, according to Velandia.  
 Central bank chief  Jose Dario Uribe  told reporters after
the meeting that Banco de la Republica “has never ruled out
intervening in the market again.” The bank purchased $20
million a day between March 3 and June 30 to curb a rally policy
makers said left the peso “misaligned.”  
 “People are betting the central bank will wait for the
next meeting to announce its intervention,” said Velandia.
“Even if there is an announcement, there is less room to
intervene as increased liquidity may pressure inflation.”  
 The central bank’s next monetary policy meeting is
scheduled for Aug. 20.  
 Velandia predicts the central bank will announce daily
purchases of as much as $30 million at this month’s meeting
should the peso strengthen beyond 1,800.  
 Export Revenue  
 The Association of Colombian Flower Exporters in a July 30
statement titled “Flower Growers Ask Where Is Banco de la
Republica” asked the central bank to intervene in the currency
market to avoid the loss of “hundreds” of jobs as the
strengthening peso cuts exporter revenue.  
 The yield on the benchmark 11 percent bonds due 2020 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.43 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. It fell to 7.42 percent
on July 30, its lowest level since March 2006. The bond’s price
fell 0.098 centavo to 124.531 centavos per peso.
