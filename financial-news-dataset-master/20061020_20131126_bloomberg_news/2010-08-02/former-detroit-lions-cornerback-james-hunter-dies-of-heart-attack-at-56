             Former Detroit Lions cornerback James
Hunter, who led the franchise in interceptions three times, died
of a heart attack at the age of 56, the team said on its
website.  
 Known as the “Hound Dog” for his ability to chase down
receivers, Hunter had 27 interceptions from 1976-1982.  
 Selected with the 10th overall pick in the 1976 draft out
of Grambling State University, Hunter played seven seasons with
Detroit. He was forced to retire due to a neck injury in 1982.  
 Hunter is survived by his wife Emmalene and his son Javin.
