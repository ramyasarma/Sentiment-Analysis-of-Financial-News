             India’s three biggest state-owned
refiners are seeking one year’s supply of ethanol, used in the
production of cleaner-burning transport fuels.  
 Indian Oil Corp. ,  Bharat Petroleum Corp. , and  Hindustan
Petroleum Corp.  want to arrange cargoes for 12 months starting
Sept. 1 of ethanol produced from biomass, including sugarcane,
corn, cassava, bagasse and other agricultural waste, according
to an advertisement in today’s Economic Times.  
 Suppliers must submit bids by 2:30 p.m. local time on Aug.
18, the companies said, without specifying quantities. The
tender document wasn’t immediately available on the refiners’
websites.  
 The government has ordered the oil companies to blend
gasoline with 5 percent of ethanol. They’ve been hampered in
efforts to meet that goal due to shortages because sugar mills
prefer to supply the liquor, chemical and other industries where
they can earn higher prices.
