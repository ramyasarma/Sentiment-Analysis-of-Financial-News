             Bob  and  Mike Bryan  won a record 62nd
doubles tennis title by beating  Eric Butorac  and  Jean-Julien
Rojer  in the final of the Farmers Classic in Los Angeles.  
 Playing in their 100th Tour final, the Californian twins
won 6-7 (6-8), 6-2, 10-7 yesterday.  
 The Bryans had tied the professional men’s record for
doubles titles with retired Australians  Mark Woodforde  and  Todd Woodbridge  in May when they won their 61st title at the Madrid
Masters.  
 “Sixty-two brings a smile to our face,”  Bob Bryan  said on
the website of the ATP World Tour. “It was a flood of emotion.
I never thought we’d be this consistent, this healthy our whole
career. Sixty-one looked like it was on the other side of the
moon. If you stay consistent, and never give up on each other --
even in dry spells -- anything can happen.”  
 The Bryan brothers, 32, finished last year as the top-
ranked doubles team after winning seven titles, including the
Australian Open and the season-ending ATP World Tour finals, and
were unbeaten for the U.S. in Davis Cup play. They’ve won six
tournaments this year, including the Australian Open at the
start of the season.  
 Woodforde  and  Woodbridge , known as “the Woodies,” also
won a men’s record 11 Grand Slam doubles titles. The Bryans, who
have won eight doubles majors, said in an interview in Monte
Carlo in April that mark is within their reach because doubles
players tend to peak in their mid-30s.
