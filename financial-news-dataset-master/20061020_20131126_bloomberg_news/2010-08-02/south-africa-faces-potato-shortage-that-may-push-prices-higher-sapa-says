             South Africa has been hit by a potato
shortage, which may result in “dramatically” higher prices,
the South African Press Association reported, citing a McCain 
Foods (SA) Ltd. statement.  
 Heavy rains earlier this year delayed harvesting while
crops were also affected by disease and frost, the Johannesburg-
based news service said.
