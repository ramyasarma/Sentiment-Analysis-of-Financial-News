-- U.S. Manufacturing Expansion Probably Slowed in July

             Manufacturing in the U.S. probably
expanded in July at a slower pace and construction spending fell
for a second month, signaling the world’s largest economy is
cooling, economists said before reports today.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s factory  index  dropped
to an eight-month low of 54 from 56.2, according to the median
estimate of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Readings
greater than 50 signal growth. Separate figures may show
 spending  on construction projects declined 0.5 percent in June.  
 Production may ease to a more sustainable pace as the surge
in inventory rebuilding that sparked a manufacturing-led
economic recovery winds down. Companies such as  Caterpillar Inc. 
are benefiting more from overseas demand as limited job growth
in the U.S. restrains consumer spending.  
 “Manufacturing is seeing a moderation in the rate of
growth, just like the rest of the economy,” said  Russell Price ,
a senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Inc. in Detroit.
“We’ll still get some boost from inventory restocking, just not
to the same extent as before. Demand will return slowly.”  
 The dollar was little changed against the euro today,
trading at $1.3064 at 9:36 a.m. in London.  
 Economists’ expectations of a U.S. slowdown fit with data
published earlier today in China showing manufacturing at its
weakest in more than a year. A Chinese purchasing managers’
index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics slid to
49.4 in July from 50.4 in the prior month, while separate
government-backed PMI figures fell to 51.2 from 52.1.  
 ISM’s Report  
 The Tempe, Arizona-based ISM’s report on U.S. manufacturing
is due at 10 a.m. New York time. Estimates in the Bloomberg
survey ranged from 52.5 to 56.  
 Also at 10 a.m., the Commerce Department will release data
on construction spending. Economists’ projections ranged from a
drop of 2.1 percent to a gain of 0.5 percent, following a 0.2
percent decline in May.  
 Manufacturing shares have outperformed the broader market
this year. The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Industrial
 Machinery Index , which includes Caterpillar and  Deere & Co. , has
increased 14.5 percent in 2010 compared with a 1.2 percent
decline in the S&P 500.  
 The manufacturing industry, which accounts for about 11
percent of the economy, has been driving the recovery from the
worst recession since the 1930s as rising sales in markets such
as China led businesses to ramp up spending on equipment and to
replenish  stockpiles .  
 Construction Equipment  
 Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, this month raised its full-year earnings  forecast  on
higher demand in developing countries for mining, energy and
rail equipment.  
 “You’ve got strong growth in India and China that provides
demand for commodities,”  Ed Rapp , chief financial officer of
the Peoria, Illinois-based company, said in an interview on July
22. “Most of the mining is happening in the developing parts of
the world.”  
 China’s economy is also still powering Europe’s economy,
reports published today showed. Euro-region manufacturing
expanded faster than initially estimated in July, Swiss
manufacturing grew the most on record and U.K. activity slowed
less than economists had forecast.  
 In the U.S., further gains in manufacturing require a
pickup in consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the economy. A Commerce Department report last week showed
second-quarter gross domestic product grew at a 2.4 percent
annual pace, less than the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg, as Americans limited purchases.  
 Inventories  
 “This is solid growth,”  Christina Romer , chairwoman of
President  Barack Obama ’s Council of Economic Advisers, said in a
July 30 interview with Bloomberg Television. “It is not strong
enough.”  
 Corporate spending on equipment and software, which had the
biggest increase since 1997, contributed 1.4 percentage points
to economic growth last quarter and the change in inventories
added about 1.1 points, according to the GDP report.  
 Some regional reports reinforce the deceleration in
manufacturing. The Federal Reserve Bank of  Philadelphia ’s
general economic index fell last month to the lowest level since
August 2009, while the  New York  Fed’s measure dropped to the
lowest this year. In contrast, a July 30 report showed the ISM-
Chicago business barometer rose to a three-month high of 62.3 in
July.  
 The projected drop in construction spending underscores the
weakness in homebuilding and sales after the expiration of a
government tax credit that boosted builder sentiment and brought
starts to the highest level in more than a year in April. Demand
will now depend on the state of the labor market and on
foreclosures.  
 More than seven out of 10 Americans say the economy is
still mired in a recession, and the country is conflicted over
how to balance concerns over joblessness and the federal budget
deficit, according to a Bloomberg National Poll. The U.S. lost
8.4 million jobs during the slump that began in December 2007.
