             Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ raised
its forecast for the euro, pound and yen against the dollar,
citing a “recent selloff on U.S. growth concern.”  
 The bank now predicts the euro will trade at $1.18 in six
months from a previous forecast for $1.15,  Derek Halpenny  and
 Lee Hardman , foreign-exchange analysts in London, said in a
research note.  
 Sterling may reach $1.3840 in 12 months from a previous
estimate of $1.3250, and the yen may be at 97 per dollar from 95
over the same period, according to the report.  
 “The broader story is still the same but given the scale
of the movements we have made some adjustments,” Halpenny said
today in a telephone interview. “For both Europe and the U.K.
the fundamental story has been one of the big surprises.”  
 The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.3119 as of 2:42 p.m. in
London. The pound gained 0.9 percent to $1.5836 and the yen was
little changed at 86.55 per dollar.
