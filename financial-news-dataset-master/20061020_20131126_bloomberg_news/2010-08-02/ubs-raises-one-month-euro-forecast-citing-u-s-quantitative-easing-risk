             UBS AG raised its one-month estimate
for the euro to $1.28 from $1.20, citing the possibility that
the Federal Reserve will purchase more bonds.  
 “The risk that the Fed resumes quantitative easing is
clearly weighing on the dollar,” UBS analysts led by  Mansoor Mohi-uddin  in Singapore, said today in an e-mailed research
note. “This is likely to keep the greenback undermined.”
