             MetLife Inc. , the insurer buying a
non-U.S. unit from American International Group Inc., said
earnings per share will be lower than previously forecast after
it boosted the size of a stock sale to fund the deal.  
 The acquisition will add 40 cents to 45 cents to next
year’s operating earnings per share, New York-based MetLife said
today in a regulatory filing. That compares with a projection of
45 cents to 55 cents in March, when the company announced the
purchase. MetLife is selling 75 million shares, valued at $3.15
billion as of the company’s July 30 close. That compares with
the $2 billion the insurer planned in March.  
 “Based on what we’ve outlined today, we think those will
be the effective sources of financing for the deal,”
 Christopher Breslin , a spokesman for MetLife, said in a
telephone interview.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Robert Henrikson  agreed in March to
pay about $15.5 billion for AIG’s American Life Insurance Co. to
expand in nations including Japan and Poland. The deal is valued
at about $16.1 billion based on the July 30 value of New York-
based MetLife securities, the company said in a separate filing.  
 “The integration of certain operations and the differences
in operational culture following the acquisition will require
the dedication of significant management resources,” MetLife
said in the filing today about the share sale.  
 MetLife gained 67 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $42.73 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . That compares
with $38.92 on March 5, the last trading day before the deal was
announced. AIG jumped $1.57, or 4.1 percent, to $40.04.  
 20 Million Customers  
 MetLife is adding Alico’s 12,500  employees  and 20 million
customers to strengthen outside the U.S., where the market is
contracting. Net income at the unit in the six months ended May
31 more than tripled to $694 million from $208 million in the
year-earlier period. Alico’s equity, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, advanced 4 percent in the 6 months ended May 31 to
$13.3 billion, according to the filing.  
 “MetLife plans to fund the acquisition prudently, but will
be spreading itself a bit thin, at least in the short run, as it
stretches to take advantage of what it perceives to be a rare
opportunity to expand its global franchise,” wrote  Kathleen Shanley , a bond analyst at Gimme Credit LLC, in a note to
clients in March.  
 AIG is selling assets to help repay a government bailout
valued at $182.3 billion. The unit sale to MetLife is expected
to be completed in the fourth quarter, the insurer reiterated
today.  
 Bank of America  
 MetLife reiterated today that it plans to sell $3.1 billion
of  senior debt  to help finance the cash portion of the deal.
When the deal was announced, the firm said it will also pay AIG
with 78.2 million shares of its common stock. The balance of the
equity portion was expected to be paid in $2.7 billion of
contingent convertible preferred stock and $3 billion of equity
units, MetLife said in March.  
 Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche
Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, UBS AG and Wells Fargo & Co. are
managing the share sale, MetLife said.
