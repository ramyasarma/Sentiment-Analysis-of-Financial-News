             Investors should buy bullish options
on  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  because the world’s biggest
luxury carmaker may rally if it joins the  Euro Stoxx 50 Index  in
September, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  
 Raymond Hing , a London-based equity derivatives strategist
at Credit Suisse, recommended purchasing BMW’s September 44 euro
calls, while also selling September 38 euro puts, a strategy
known as a risk reversal, in a note dated July 30. BMW climbed
1.3 percent to 41.86 euros as of 4:22 p.m. today in Frankfurt.  
 “There is a strong case for an inclusion of BMW” into the
benchmark gauge for euro-region stocks, Hing wrote. Using prices
from midday on July 30, BMW ranks 36th in a list of equities
eligible for the Euro Stoxx 50, compared with index member Aegon
NV, the owner of U.S. insurer Transamerica Corp., which is 64th,
according to Hing.  
 The risk reversal strategy, which involves selling a put to
help finance the purchase of the call, is attractive because
BMW’s bearish options are more expensive relative to bullish
ones, Hing said.  Implied volatility , the key gauge of options
prices, is 38.99 for puts 10 percent below the stock price and
27.55 for calls 10 percent above for contracts two months from
expiration, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Investors also may profit by buying BMW’s October 43 euro
calls while selling rival  Daimler AG ’s October 43 calls,
according to the Zurich-based firm, Switzerland’s second-largest
bank. Credit Suisse has an “outperform” recommendation on BMW
with a share-price forecast of 52 euros.  
 BMW, Daimler  
 BMW has rallied 32 percent  this year , while Daimler is up
11 percent. That  compares with  an 11 percent gain for the  Stoxx
600 Automobiles & Parts Index  and 5.7 percent advance for
Germany’s benchmark DAX Index.  
 Inclusion of BMW into the Euro Stoxx 50 “may help the
group’s shares outperform Daimler’s over the next couple of
months,” Hing wrote. October options are best because Stoxx
Ltd. is scheduled to make the announcement in “early
September” and some asset managers who track the benchmark
gauge may take longer to adjust their holdings, he wrote.
