             Hang Seng Bank Ltd.,  the Hong Kong
lender majority-owned by  HSBC Holdings Plc , said first-half
profit rose 8.4 percent after it earned more fee income from its
wealth-management unit.  
 Net income  rose to HK$6.96 billion ($896 million), or
HK$3.64 a share, from HK$6.43 billion, or HK$3.36 a share, a
year earlier, the bank said in a statement today. Profit beat
the HK$6.81 billion median estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  
 Hang Seng, the biggest Hong Kong-based bank by market value,
and  rivals  are battling narrowing lending margins as competition
intensifies and interest rates stay near a 20-year low. Earnings
are primarily supported by growth in wealth-management business
income, which surged 15 percent, Chief Executive Officer
 Margaret Leung  said in today’s statement.  
 “Looking into the second-half, I expect margins will stay
under pressure as interest rates don’t seem to be going up any
time soon,”  Kenny Tang , an executive director at Hong Kong-
based Redford Asset Management Ltd., said before the earnings.
“There may be some improvement in fee income if the stock
market picks up, but overall I don’t expect too much changes in
the second half as Hang Seng is quite a conservative bank.”  
 Hang Seng  rose 1.3 percent to close at HK$109, before the
earnings announcement. The stock has fallen 5 percent this year,
compared with a 4.8 percent loss on the Hang Seng Finance Index,
which tracks Hong Kong-listed banks including those based in
mainland China. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  fell 2.1 percent
in the same period.
