             South Africa is concerned about the
country’s high steel prices even after  ArcelorMittal South
Africa Ltd.  canceled a surcharge on its products.  
 Prices were already “amongst the highest in the world
prior to the introduction of the iron ore surcharge,” the
Department of Trade and Industry said in a statement today.
“The DTI remains extremely concerned about the high price of
steel in the South African economy.”  
 ArcelorMittal South Africa canceled the surcharge this
month after reaching an interim accord with  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. 
following a dispute between the two companies over prices for
the steelmaking ingredient. ArcelorMittal introduced the levy
from May 1 after Kumba halted a nine-year-old supply agreement
through which the company sold ore at 3 percent above cost.  
 The steelmaker, a unit of the world’s largest steelmaker,
will “charge a single, all-in price, reflecting the higher cost
of iron ore, rather than a separate surcharge,” it said in a
statement.  
 Under the interim deal, ArcelorMittal South Africa will pay
$50 a metric ton for ore supplied to its one coastal plant, and
$70 a ton for its two inland mills. Kumba was seeking the market
rate for its iron ore, currently at about $142 a ton. Iron ore
made up 17 percent of ArcelorMittal South Africa’s total costs
of 4.3 billion rand ($592 million) for the half year ended June.  
 The surcharge, based on market rates, was halted “because
we now have a firm price from Kumba,” ArcelorMittal South
Africa Chief Executive Officer  Nonkululeko Nyembezi-Heita  said
on July 28.
