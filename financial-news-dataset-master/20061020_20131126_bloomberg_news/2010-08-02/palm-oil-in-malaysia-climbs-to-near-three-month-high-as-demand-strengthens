             Palm oil futures rose to the highest
level in more than three months after reports showed that sales
from Malaysia, the second-biggest producer, gained last month.  
 October-delivery futures added 2.1 percent to 2,570 ringgit
($814) a metric ton, the highest since April 9, on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange in Kuala Lumpur. Prices added 6.1 percent
in July, the biggest monthly gain in five.  
 Palm oil exports from Malaysia climbed 4.4 percent in July
to 1,412,300 tons from a month earlier, market surveyor Intertek
said July 31. Rival Societe Generale de Surveillance said sales
gained 4.7 percent to 1,402,317 tons last month.  
 Crude oil rose to the highest in four days as Asian stocks
rallied after China’s manufacturing rose in July, increasing the
appeal of palm oil as a biofuel feedstock. September-delivery
crude oil added as much as 0.7 percent to $79.53 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 “Everything seems to be supportive for palm oil today,”
said  Ryan Long , a trader at OSK Investment Bank Sdn. “Better-
than-expected exports from Malaysia and higher crude are all
pointing to a firm trend. The only negative is a strong
ringgit.”  
 The ringgit rose to a two-year high on optimism investors
will pump more funds into Asian assets as regional economies
lead the recovery from a global recession, raising the cost for
palm oil buyers. The currency advanced as much as 1 percent to
3.1514 per dollar in Kuala Lumpur.  
 Malaysia Rain  
 La Nina, which brings above-normal rainfall in Asia, can
disrupt palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia, the top
growers, and cause dry weather in North America, hurting soybean
crops. Palm and soybean oils are substitutes and account for
more than 60 percent of global edible oils supplies and demand.  
 “It has been raining in Malaysia and that’s adding to some
concern about future production outlook,” OSK’s Long said.  
 The La Nina weather could sometime favor higher production
and it is too early to call if it would pose significant threat
to production,  Bernard Ching , an analyst at ECM Libra Investment
Research, in a report today.  
 December-delivery soybean oil jumped as much as 1 percent
to 40.96 cents a pound and the vegetable oil’s  premium  over palm
oil narrowed to $89.03 a ton from $105.8 on July 30, according
to Bloomberg data. November-delivery soybeans  rallied as much
as 1.7 percent to $10.21 a bushel, the highest since Jan. 11.  
 CME Group Inc.’s October-delivery palm oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, jumped as much as 2.9 percent
to $815.20 a ton, the highest since the contract started trading
in May. On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery palm
oil surged 2.5 percent to 6,910 yuan ($1,020) a ton, while
soybean oil added 2 percent to 7,842 yuan a ton.
