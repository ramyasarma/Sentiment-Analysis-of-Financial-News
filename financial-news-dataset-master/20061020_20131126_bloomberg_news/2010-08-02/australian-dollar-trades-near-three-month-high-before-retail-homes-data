             The Australian dollar traded near a
three-month high before reports economists estimate will show
the nation’s retail sales and building approvals advanced,
adding to signs the nation’s economy is growing.  
 The New Zealand dollar was close to a one-week high as a
rally in stocks and commodities boosted demand for currencies
linked to growth. The Reserve Bank of Australia today is
forecast to keep the benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent,
according to all 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “Commodities are recovering on the back of better risk
appetite, which is generally a very positive environment for
both the Australian and New Zealand dollars,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in
Sydney. “In terms of both currencies against the U.S. dollar, I
don’t think we are seeing the peak just yet. Equity markets’
momentum is going to take both currencies higher.”  
 Australia’s currency was at 91.23 U.S. cents as of 11:12
a.m. in Sydney from 91.37 cents yesterday, when it reached 91.46
cents, the highest level since May 4. It was at 78.95 yen from
79.04 yen. New Zealand’s dollar traded at 73.33 U.S. cents from
73.28 cents, after touching 73.42 cents yesterday, the strongest
since July 27. It fetched 63.46 yen from 63.38 yen.  
 Australia’s retail sales increased 0.4 percent in June
after rising 0.2 percent in May, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey before a Bureau of
Statistics report today. Home-building approvals gained 2
percent in June, a separate survey showed.  
 Interest-Rate Policy  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  of regional shares advanced 0.8
percent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200  Index  also rose 0.8 percent.
The Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index  of raw materials advanced 0.9
percent yesterday, gaining for a fourth day.  
 Australia’s policy makers signaled last month that they are
watching inflation to assess whether to resume rate increases.
The central bank left borrowing costs unchanged in June and July.  
 Australia’s consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in the second
quarter from the previous three months, the Bureau of Statistics
said on July 28. The median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a gain of 1 percent.  
 “Do not expect any move from the RBA today, but this
should not stop the Australian dollar from moving higher,”
 David Croy , an interest-rate strategist at ANZ National Bank Ltd.
in Wellington, wrote in a note today. “Expect demand for the
New Zealand dollar both locally and offshore to continue
throughout today.”  
 The Aussie was at NZ$1.2449 from NZ$1.2466 yesterday. It
reached NZ$1.2506 on July 30, the strongest since May 28.  
 Swaps traders are betting the RBA will raise its target
rate by 16 basis points over the next 12 months, a Credit Suisse
AG  index  showed today.  
 Australian government bonds were little changed. The yield
on the 4.5 percent note maturing in April 2020 was 5.19 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a
fixed payment made to receive floating rates, rose to 4.04
percent from 4.03 percent.
