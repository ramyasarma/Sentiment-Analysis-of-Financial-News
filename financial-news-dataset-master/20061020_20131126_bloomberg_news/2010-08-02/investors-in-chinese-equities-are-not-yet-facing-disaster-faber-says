             The Chinese economy hasn’t crashed
and stock investors aren’t yet facing a “disaster,” said  Marc Faber , publisher of the Gloom, Boom & Doom report.  
 “Now that the bad news is essentially out of the markets,
it has started to rebound,” Faber said today on Bloomberg
Television’s “InsideTrack” from Zurich. “Altogether I would say
it is not going to be a disaster for stock investors yet.”  
 China’s July manufacturing data were the weakest in more
than a year as the government clamped down on property
speculation and investment in polluting and energy-intensive
factories, figures showed today. A purchasing managers’ index
released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics slid to 49.4
from 50.4 in June.  
 Officials may delay raising interest rates from crisis
levels as austerity measures and unemployment in advanced
economies dim the outlook for exports. Chinese stocks rose after
today’s data, as analysts including those at Morgan Stanley said
the government may do more to aid growth by year-end.  
 “Markets go up because they expect further easing measures
and maybe further stimulus,” Faber said.
