             Ford Motor Co.’s   credit rating  was
raised two levels by Standard & Poor’s because of expectations
the company will remain profitable and signs that customers have
a better impression of the automaker’s vehicles.  
 The rating was raised to B+, the fourth level below
investment-grade, from B-, S&P said today in a statement. The
outlook is positive.  
 Ford has “substantial”  cash  balances and likely will
continue to generate free operating  cash flow , the ratings firm
said. The retail market has an “improved perception” of Ford’s
vehicles and its efforts to introduce more fuel-efficient models
in the next few years, S&P said.  
 “It’s a step in the right direction,” said  Kirk Ludtke ,
senior vice president of CRT Capital Group in Stamford,
Connecticut. “It was largely anticipated. It will be a while
before they get back to investment grade.”  
 Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, rose 36 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $13.13 at 2:18 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite  trading . The shares gained 28 percent this year before
today.  
 Ford’s 7.45 percent notes due in July 2031 rose 1 cent to
98 cents on the dollar, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The yield fell to 7.64 percent from 7.74 percent.  
 Ford Debt  
 Ford has more debt than its U.S. rivals because it borrowed
$23 billion in late 2006, before credit markets froze, helping
the company avoid the bankruptcies that befell General Motors
Corp. and Chrysler LLC. The borrowing left Ford with obligations
that Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  says now put it at a
competitive disadvantage.  
 Ford’s automotive  operations  had $21.9 billion in cash on
June 30, down from $25.3 billion on March 31. Ford paid down $7
billion in automotive  debt  in the second quarter, lowering it to
$27.3 billion from $34.3 billion at the start of the quarter.
Ford said today it will have a positive automotive net cash
position by the end of 2011.  
 The company’s annual automotive debt maturities are less
than $2 billion until 2013, and the debt reduction has lowered
the risk that Ford’s  liquidity  could fall to “dangerously low
levels” in the coming years, S&P said.  
 Mulally has overhauled Ford’s lineup, redesigning cars such
as the Taurus and Fusion, and adding extras like heated leather
seats and voice-activated electronics. He also boosted quality,
winning Ford price gains of $1.1 billion on cars and trucks in
the second quarter and helping all of its auto units worldwide
to become profitable.  
 “Ford is making progress in stabilizing, and perhaps
improving its U.S. market share,” S&P said in the statement.
