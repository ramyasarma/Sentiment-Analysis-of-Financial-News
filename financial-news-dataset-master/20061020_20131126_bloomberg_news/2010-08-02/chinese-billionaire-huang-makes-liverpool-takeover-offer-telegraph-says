             Chinese billionaire Kenneth Huang
made an offer to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc to buy
Liverpool soccer club’s debt of 237 million pounds ($373.5
million), the Daily Telegraph reported.  
 In an effort to delay the bank accepting Huang’s offer,
Liverpool co-owner George Gillett has presented Syrian
businessman Yahya Kirdi as a possible bidder for the club, the
newspaper said.  
 Gillett told RBS last week that he was in advanced
negotiations with Kirdi after Huang began talks over a deal that
would see Gillett and co-owner Tom Hicks exit the club without
any profit, the Telegraph added.
