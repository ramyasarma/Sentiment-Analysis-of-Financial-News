             Nedbank Group Ltd. , the South African
bank controlled by  Old Mutual Plc , said first-half profit
dropped 16 percent as the loss at its retail business widened.  
 Net income fell to 2.15 billion rand ($296 million) from
2.56 billion rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based bank
said in a statement today.  
 South African credit growth remained muted even after the
central bank cut its benchmark  interest rate  in March to the
lowest in at least a decade to spur spending. Consumers are
struggling to repay debt to Nedbank and rivals such as Standard
Bank Group Ltd. and  Absa Group Ltd.  as the economy recovers from
its first recession since the end of apartheid in 1994.  
 “The recovery is taking longer than initially expected,”
Chief Executive Officer  Mike Brown  said in the statement.
“Household spending has been slow to recover, with high
personal debt levels, tight credit conditions and further
employment losses hampering consumption.”  
 Nedbank has climbed 9 percent in Johannesburg trading this
year, making it the second-worst performer on the five-member
 FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index , which gained 11 percent.  
 The loss before one-time items at Nedbank’s consumer
operation was 115 million rand compared with 69 million rand a
year ago.  
 “Our strategy remains unchanged, but we will manage our
portfolio of businesses more aggressively to focus on areas we
believe will yield the highest growth in economic profit over
the longer term,” Brown said.
