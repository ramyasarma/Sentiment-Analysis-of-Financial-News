             Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.
will consider plans to introduce faster systems to handle
securities transactions, Ming Pao Daily News reported today,
citing Chief Executive Officer Charles Li. The conditions are
not yet in place for Hong Kong to offer so-called high-
frequency trading, which will inevitably be adopted in the long
term, Li was cited as saying in an interview with the Hong Kong-
based newspaper.
