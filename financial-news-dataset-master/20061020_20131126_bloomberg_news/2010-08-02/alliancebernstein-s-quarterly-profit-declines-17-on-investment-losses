             AllianceBernstein Holding LP , a New
York asset manager overseeing $457.7 billion, said second-
quarter net income fell 17 percent because of losses related to
deferred-compensation investments.  
 Net income declined to $31.8 million, or 31 cents a share,
compared with $38.3 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier, the
company said today in a statement. Excluding some costs,
earnings of 38 cents a share missed the 45-cent average estimate
of nine analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  
 AllianceBernstein booked $57 million of investment losses
in the quarter, led by $37 million in losses on investments tied
to deferred compensation. Assets under management declined to
$457.7 billion from $501.3 billion at the start of the quarter
as clients withdrew a net $4.7 billion and market swings erased
$38.9 billion in value.  
 “Increased volatility around the globe, caused in large
part by the European credit crisis, led many investors to seek
safe havens and sell riskier assets,”  Peter S. Kraus , chairman
and chief executive officer of the company, said in the
statement. “This dynamic had an adverse impact on our equity
services.”  
 AllianceBernstein has declined 5.1 percent this year in New
York Stock Exchange composite  trading , compared with the 8
percent drop for the  Standard & Poor’s  15-company index of
assets managers and custody banks.
