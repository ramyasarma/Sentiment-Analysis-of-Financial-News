             UBS AG , the largest Swiss lender by
assets, reached an agreement to have a new office building
constructed at the City of London’s Broadgate complex that will
have four 1.5-acre trading floors.  
 UBS will initially pay Broadgate’s owners,  British Land Co. 
and Blackstone Group LP, an annual rent of 54.50 pounds ($86) a
square foot to lease the 700,000 square-foot (65,032 square-
meter) building, according to a statement today. The bank agreed
to lease the site for 20 years with an option to leave the upper
floors after 10 years or 15 years.  
 UBS is already the largest tenant at Broadgate, the City of
London’s largest office estate, where it rents about 1 million
square feet in five buildings. The new property will be larger
than any existing office structure in London’s main financial
district, although two bigger projects by other developers may
be finished around the same time.  
 “We are excited to have the chance to make a substantial
investment in a project that will rejuvenate Broadgate and
retain 5,000 employees in the City of London,” said  Chad Pike ,
senior managing director of Blackstone.  
 The lack of new space coming onto the market caused the
average rent for the best offices in the City to rise by 5
percent in the second quarter to about 50 pounds a square foot,
according to Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. That’s spurring developers
to start or revive projects after most were shelved in the
recession.  
 340 Million Pounds  
 British Land  and Blackstone will spend about 340 million
pounds developing the building on the site of two existing
properties at Broadgate, according to the statement. UBS had an
option to cancel its existing lease agreements between 2013 and
2017.  
 A group of investors building the Pinnacle, a 1 million
square-foot tower near Liverpool Street railway station, plans
to complete it by 2013. Great Portland Estates Plc and
Brookfield Properties Corp. are due to start building a 770,000
square-foot structure in the same part of London by 2012.
