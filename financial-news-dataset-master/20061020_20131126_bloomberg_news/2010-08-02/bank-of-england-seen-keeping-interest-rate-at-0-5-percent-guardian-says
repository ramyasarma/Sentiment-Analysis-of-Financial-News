             The Bank of England’s monetary policy
committee is likely to keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.5
percent when it meets on Aug. 5, according to  Howard Archer , IHS
Global Insight’s chief economist, the Guardian reported.  
 Considerations that will influence the decision include
predictions of a second monthly rise in U.S. unemployment,
slower growth in the eurozone, China and Japan and unexpectedly
weak U.K. house prices and exports, the newspaper said.
