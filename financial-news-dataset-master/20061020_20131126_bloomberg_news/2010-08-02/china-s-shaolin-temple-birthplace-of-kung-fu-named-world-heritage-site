             Shaolin temple, the Buddhist
monastery that’s also the birthplace of kung fu, has been 
added to the United Nations’ list of World Heritage Sites.  
 The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
named historical monuments near Dengfeng city, including the
Shaolin, to its list of heritage sites yesterday, according to a
statement on the group’s website.  
 Dengfeng is the 40th site in China to be added to the
Unesco heritage list, which may help boost tourism to the city
in Henan province. Local authorities had applied for the Unesco
designation for nine years, Xinhua News Agency reported. China
is also ‘ready’ to apply next year for West Lake in the eastern
city of Hangzhou to be added, according to Xinhua.  
 The Dengfeng site in central China includes eight clusters
of structures at the foot of the 1,500 meter-high Songshan
mountain. In addition to Shaolin temple, the site also includes
three Han Que gates, which are the remains of the oldest
religious edifices in China, according to Unesco.  
 Unesco has named 910 locations to its World Heritage Sites
list, which includes 704 cultural sites, 179 natural heritage
sites and 27 mixed properties.
