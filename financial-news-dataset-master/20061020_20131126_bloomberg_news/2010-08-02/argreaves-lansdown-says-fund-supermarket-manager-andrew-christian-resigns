             Hargreaves Lansdown Plc  said  Andrew Christian , who oversaw the U.K. retail brokerage’s online fund
supermarket, resigned after 19 years at the firm.  
 Christian, 43, stepped down with immediate effect, the
Bristol, England-based company said in a statement today. He had
run the firm’s Vantage and brokerage operations since 2003.  
 “I believe he is going to do some personal day-trading,”
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Ian Gorham said by telephone.
“It’s all very amicable.” Christian couldn’t immediately be
reached on his office telephone.  
 Hargreaves, Britain’s biggest retail brokerage, said in
April CEO Peter Hargreaves will step down this year, 29 years
after starting the firm with Stephen Lansdown.  
 The shares climbed 5.5 pence, or 1.5 percent, to 368 pence
as of 12:11 p.m. in London trading. The stock has climbed 25
percent this year, for a market value of about 1.75 billion
pounds ($2.8 billion).
