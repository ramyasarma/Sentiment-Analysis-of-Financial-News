             United Nations carbon credits rose as
the regulator of the Clean Development Mechanism rejected a
record number of projects.  
 The  executive board  of the CDM turned down 22 projects
requesting registration, the most during any single meeting, and
approved 21 applications, some conditionally, according to the
minutes published from last week’s meeting. The previous record
was 12, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the London-
based research company owned by Bloomberg LP.  
 UN Certified Emission Reduction credits for December 2010
rose 12 cents, or 1 percent, to 12.06 euros ($15.76) a metric
ton on the European Climate Exchange as of 9:10 a.m., extending
a four-day gaining streak. European Union allowances for
December rose 0.8 percent to 14.26 euros.  
 The UN-overseen board is seeking to respond to criticism
that it is approving projects that would have gone ahead even
without the credits. The value of the global carbon market
expanded 6 percent last year to $144 billion, according to  a
World Bank report . The value of transactions in the EU program
rose to $118 billion, while sales of new CDM credits contracted
59 percent to $2.7 billion, because of lower prices, complex
regulations and administrative bottlenecks.  
 “The amount of projects rejected at this executive board
meeting is unprecedented,”  John Romankiewicz , an analyst in New
York for New Energy Finance, said by e-mail July 31.
