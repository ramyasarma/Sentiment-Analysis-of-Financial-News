             Ecuador’s credit rating was raised
one level by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service, which cited the
nation’s “willingness” to pay its debt.  
 S&P raised Ecuador’s long-term sovereign credit rating to
B-, six levels below investment grade, from CCC+ with a stable
outlook. The rating is in line with Argentina, Jamaica and
Pakistan.  
 “The willingness of the government of Ecuador to honor its
recognized debt has improved,” New York-based analyst  Richard Francis  said in the statement. “Willingness, more than ability,
had been the main rating constraint at the previous rating
level.”  
 The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Ecuadorean dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries shrank 6 basis points to 1,032
at 4:30 p.m. New York time, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
EMBI+ index. The gap reached 1,037 basis points on July 30, the
highest since September. Ecuadorean sovereign debt is the
second-riskiest after Venezuela’s among 15 emerging markets
tracked by JPMorgan.  
 President  Rafael Correa  stopped payments in December 2008
on $510 million of 2012 bonds and in March on $2.7 billion of
2030 bonds, saying the securities were “illegitimate” and
“illegal.” The country has had limited access to financing
since then.  
 Ecuador adopted the dollar as its currency in 2000.  
 “Balance-of-payments pressures as well as banking-sector
and fiscal weaknesses could undermine dollarization over the
coming years,” Francis wrote.
