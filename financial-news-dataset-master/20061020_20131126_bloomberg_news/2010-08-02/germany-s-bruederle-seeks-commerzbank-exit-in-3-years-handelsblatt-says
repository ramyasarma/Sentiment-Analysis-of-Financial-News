             German Economy Minister  Rainer Bruederle  wants the state to exit Commerzbank AG in three years
at the latest,  Handelsblatt  said, citing an interview.  
 Commerzbank may raise about 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion)
to 6 billion euros in a share sale in the second half of 2010 to
start paying back government funds, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified investment bankers. A second step may include
another capital increase next year and the Soffin bank-rescue
fund selling its stake in the lender, Handelsblatt reported.
