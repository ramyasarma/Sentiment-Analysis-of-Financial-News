             French car  sales  dropped 13 percent
last month, led by models from General Motors Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp., as government incentives were gradually withdrawn.  
 New car  registrations  dropped to 169,804 in July from
194,855 a year earlier, France’s CCFA carmakers’ association
said today in a statement. The decline gathered pace from the
1.2 percent drop recorded in June.  
 “The decline accelerated, but we’re seeing a soft landing
compared to countries that canceled their incentives,”
association spokesman  Francois Roudier  said by telephone. In
contrast with the German market, down more than 30 percent this
year, French sales are up 2.8 percent for the first seven
months.  
 While Germany completely withdrew its 2,500-euro ($3,270)
incentives last September, France has prolonged the payments
with a gradual phase-out. The French bonus for trading in an old
vehicle was cut to 500 euros from 700 euros on July 1.  
 The remaining payment continued to spur sales of smaller
models, the CCFA said. Among France’s 10 top-selling cars last
month, eight are compacts such as  Renault SA ’s Megane or
subcompacts including the Peugeot 207, and all are French,
barring  Volkswagen AG ’s Polo.  
 “Mass carmakers are pulling through relatively well --
particularly the French,” Roudier said. The association
maintained its 2 million vehicle-sales forecast for the full
year.  
 Opel, Volkswagen  
 GM’s European Opel brand recorded a 30 percent sales drop
to 6,462 registrations in July, the association said, while
Toyota recorded a 27 percent decline to 5,192 cars.  
 Volkswagen AG , Europe’s biggest carmaker, bucked the French
market decline with a 12 percent sales gain for the main VW
brand. The group’s overall car registrations still fell 0.7
percent to 20,842 as its no-frills Seat unit recorded a 31
percent deliveries slump.  
 Sales by Paris-based  PSA Peugeot Citroen , Europe’s No.2
carmaker, fell 15 percent to 55,413 cars, while smaller domestic
rival Renault recorded a 7.6 percent drop to 42,761.  
 A surge in demand for delivery trucks, whose registrations
rose 13 percent to 34,078, helped to limit France’s decline in
overall light-vehicle sales to 9.3 percent, and to 12 percent
for Peugeot, 2.4 percent for Renault and 4.4 percent for Italy’s
Fiat SpA -- whose car sales alone dropped 8 percent to 6,794
units.
