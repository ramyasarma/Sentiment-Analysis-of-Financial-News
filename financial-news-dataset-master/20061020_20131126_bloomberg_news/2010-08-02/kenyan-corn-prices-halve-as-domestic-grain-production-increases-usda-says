             Corn prices in Kenya, East Africa’s
biggest economy, have fallen as much as 60 percent in recent
months as grain production climbs, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Foreign Service said.  
 “Farmers who received about 2,500 shillings ($31) per 90-
kilogram (198-pound) bag of corn during much of the early part
of the 2010 marketing year are reportedly now being offered from
1,000 shillings to 1,500 shillings,” the agency said in a
 report  on its website today.  
 Corn prices in Kenya jumped last year as drought drove up
the price of staple foods. Prices have since declined following
heavy rains during the long March to May wet season,  Aly-Khan Satchu , an independent analyst, said from Nairobi on June 24.  
 Production of corn, Kenya’s staple food, has also increased
after the government provided farmers with free seeds and
fertilizer, the USDA report said.  
 Higher domestic corn output means Kenya hasn’t imported 
grain since the second quarter and isn’t likely to import any
“significant” quantities for the rest of the year, it said.  
 Kenya’s per-capita corn consumption is 97 kilograms (213.4
pounds) a year, according to the United Nations’  Food and
Agriculture Organization .
