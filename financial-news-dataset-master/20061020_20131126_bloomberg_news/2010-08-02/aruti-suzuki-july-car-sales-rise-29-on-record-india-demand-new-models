             Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. , maker of
half the cars sold in the country, said sales grew 29 percent
last month, helped by record local demand.  
 Maruti  sold 100,857 vehicles worldwide in July compared
with 78,074 a year earlier, the New Delhi-based Indian unit of
 Suzuki Motor Corp.  said in a statement today. Sales in the
domestic market surged 33 percent to a record 90,114, it said.  
 The automaker will introduce a new variant of the Alto,
India’s best-selling car, later this week as demand surges in
Asia’s third-largest automotive market. Maruti also introduced
the  Eeco  van and a new version of the WagonR compact this year
to compete with hatchbacks from Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG,
who are expanding into the South Asian country.  
 Maruti rose as much as 1.7 percent to 1,218.50 rupees in
Mumbai and changed hands at 1,209.85 rupees at 10:36 a.m.
