             Hog futures rose to a three-week high
and pork bellies surged the most allowed in Chicago, as climbing
U.S. wholesale-pork prices signaled consumer demand may be
outpacing the supply of animals to slaughterhouses. Cattle fell.  
 Wholesale-pork  rose 9.8 percent last month to 89.82 cents a
pound, the highest level since May 17, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Meatpackers processed 1.96 million hogs
last week, 7.3 percent fewer than a year earlier. The U.S. hog
herd was 3.6 percent smaller on June 1 than a year earlier,
according to the most recent USDA inventory report.  
 “We’ve been having lighter kills, which takes product off
the market,” said  Jason Golly , a vice president of risk-
management marketing at Lynch Livestock Inc. in Waucoma, Iowa.
“We’re still going to have continued heat, and that makes for
shorter” supplies because hogs take longer to reach market-ready
weight during hot weather, he said.  
 Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.575 cent, or 0.7
percent, to close at 79.6 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price touched 80.075 cents,
the highest for a most-active contract since July 9.  
 Futures have surged 48 percent in the past year as farmers
cut herds after high feed prices and the recession spurred
losses in 2008 and 2009.  
 Heat indexes in parts of Iowa, the largest hog-producing
state, may reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 Celsius) tomorrow,
according to the  National Weather Service .  
 Pork Bellies Surge  
 Pork-belly futures for August delivery surged the CME’s 3-
cent limit, rising 2.9 percent to $1.065 a pound. That marked
the highest price for a most-active contract since March 2007.
The U.S.  wholesale price  of pork bellies, used to make bacon,
was unchanged on July 30 at $1.3333 a pound, the highest level
since at least January 1998.  
 As of July 23, pork belly  stockpiles  in warehouses
monitored by the CME had plunged 73 percent from a year earlier,
as U.S. hog supplies shrank and demand recovered from recession.  
 Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.175 cent, or 0.2
percent, to 94.425 cents a pound. Earlier, the price climbed as
much as 0.6 percent. Feeder-cattle futures for September
settlement dropped 1.575 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $1.12625 a
pound.  
 Wholesale  choice beef  sank 0.7 percent at midday to $1.5071
a pound, the lowest level since March 12, according to the USDA.
Spot-market  steer  prices averaged 92.88 cents a pound last week,
down 2 percent from a week earlier.  
 “Last week was a disappointment for cash cattle,” said
 Rich Nelson , the director of research at Allendale Inc., a
broker in McHenry, Illinois. “There’s still some concern about
the overall demand picture” for beef, he said.
