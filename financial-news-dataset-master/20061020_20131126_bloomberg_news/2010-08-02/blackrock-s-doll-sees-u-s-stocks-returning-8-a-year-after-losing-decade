             U.S. stocks will return 8.1 percent a
year and the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  will almost double by
2020 after its first losing decade made American equities appear
cheap, BlackRock Inc. Vice Chairman  Robert C. Doll  said.  
 The S&P 500, which closed at 1,101.6 on July 30, will rise
85 percent to 2,034 by the decade’s end, Doll said in a
statement today. U.S. equity returns will outpace those of other
developed nations because of attractive valuations, stronger
economic growth, shareholder-friendly management practices and
more serious problems in other economies, Doll said.  
 “Many investors want to forget the last 10 years, which
featured the two worst bear markets since the Great
Depression,” Doll said in the statement. New York-based
BlackRock, which oversees about $3.2 trillion, is the world’s
largest  asset manager . “We’re not likely to see double-digit
stock returns in the coming 10 years, due to ongoing
deleveraging and significant structural problems. But two
disastrous market decades in a row is extremely unlikely.”  
 The  S&P 500  had its first retreat for a full decade from
2000 to 2009. Last year’s 23 percent rally wasn’t enough to
restore money lost in two bear markets after the Internet bubble
burst in 2000 and the collapse of the subprime mortgage industry
sent the index to a 38 percent decline in 2008.  
 Health, Technology, Energy  
 Normalized earnings-per-share growth and  price-to-earnings
ratios  for the S&P 500 over the next 10 years will match their
median rates since 1957, Doll said. The index’s current P/E is
about 15.1 times reported earnings, up from a one-year low of
13.91 reached July 2 while still below the average of 16.5 in
Bloomberg data dating back to 1954.  
 Doll, in a statement called “10 Predictions for the Next
10 Years,” also said that returns in stocks will likely outpace
U.S. Treasuries and cash over the next decade. He predicted that
the health-care,  technology  and alternative energy industries
are poised for the best growth.  
 Doll’s prediction for 8.1 percent returns in the S&P 500
calls for an annualized price gain of 6.2 percent plus a
dividend yield of 1.9 percent.
