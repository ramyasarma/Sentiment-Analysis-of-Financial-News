             BaWang International Group Holding
Ltd. Executive Director Wan Yuhua said the company would
withdraw products and compensate customers if the government
finds problems in its products, Hong Kong Economic Journal
reported.  
 A tearful Wan spoke at a press conference aired on
Guangdong television, where she denied prior knowledge of an
incident which BaWang employees stormed the Shanghai office of
the National Business Daily to complain about reports that
BaWang shampoos contained a cancer-causing chemical, the
Economic Journal said. BaWang has disputed the reports.
