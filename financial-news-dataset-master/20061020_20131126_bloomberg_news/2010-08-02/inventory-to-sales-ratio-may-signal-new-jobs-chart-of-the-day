             U.S. business inventories are so low
relative to demand that any increase may act as a catalyst for
larger companies to add workers, according to  Nicholas Colas ,
chief market strategist at BNY ConvergEx Group.  
 The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the inventory-to-sales ratio,
which fell this year to the lowest reading since the Commerce
Department started compiling the monthly data in 1992.  
 Stockpiles declined to 1.23 times sales in March from a
peak of 1.46 times, as the top panel illustrates. The latter
ratio was reached in December 2008 and matched in each of the
first three months of last year.  
 Retail  inventories have been hit especially hard, as
depicted in the bottom panel. They sank as low as 1.33 times
sales this year after averaging 1.59 times from 1992 through
last year. Comparable ratios for  manufacturers  and  wholesalers 
also appear in the panel.  
 All the ratios rose in May, the latest month available.
Further growth represents an example of “current economic
conditions that could engender future hiring among large
companies,” Colas wrote today in a report.  
 Rising labor  productivity  and corporate cash also are
favorable signs for employment, the report said. Productivity
climbed 6.1 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier,
equaling the fastest growth rate since 1995. Standard & Poor’s
500 companies held $836.8 billion in cash as of March 31 after
six straight quarters of increases, according to S&P.
