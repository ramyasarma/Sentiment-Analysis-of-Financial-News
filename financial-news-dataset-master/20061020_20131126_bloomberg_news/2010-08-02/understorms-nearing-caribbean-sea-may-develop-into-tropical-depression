             A weather system nearing the
southeastern Caribbean has a 90 percent chance of strengthening
into a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center said.  
 Showers and heavy rains 1,050 miles (1,700 kilometers)
west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands that are moving west-
northwest at 10-15 miles an hour have a “high chance” of
developing into a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the
U.S. National Hurricane Center said today on its  website .
Tropical cyclones are rotating systems that include depressions,
tropical storms and hurricanes.  
 A second system, a tropical wave crossing the Atlantic
coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras this morning in the western
Caribbean, has almost no chance of becoming a tropical cyclone
within 48 hours, the Hurricane Center in Miami also said. It may
eventually move into the Pacific from there.  
 Neither system is close to the Gulf of Mexico, where  BP Plc 
is trying to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history.
