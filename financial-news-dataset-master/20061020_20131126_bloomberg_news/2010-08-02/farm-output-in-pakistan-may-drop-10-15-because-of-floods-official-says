             Farm production in Pakistan, Asia’s
third-largest grower of wheat and the fourth-biggest producer of
cotton, may decline 10 percent to 15 percent because of damage
caused by floods, according to an industry official.  
 Crops of rice, sugar cane and corn may be among the worst
affected, Nasir Cheema, president of the agriculture chamber of
commerce, said by telephone from Karachi, without providing an
estimate of how much production may be lost.  
 Pakistan wants to increase farm output, which accounts for
a quarter of its gross domestic product, after wheat and sugar
deficits in the past two years caused nationwide riots. Wheat
advanced to a 22-month high in Chicago today amid tight global
supplies and cotton reached a one-month high in New York on July
30 as stockpiles in the U.S., the biggest exporter, plummeted to
the lowest level since December 2004.  
 “Farm output with the main crops means around 10 percent
of GDP, and if livestock is included it means around 21 percent
of the GDP growth for Pakistan,” said Sayem Ali, an economist
at Standard Chartered Pakistan Ltd. “Any decline in this will
definitely hurt the economy since the impact will be passed on
to the other sectors as well.”  
 The country will harvest 23.87 million metric tons of wheat
in the year started July 1, compared with 24.03 million tons in
2009, and gather 14 million bales of cotton, from 12.7 million
bales last year, the farm ministry said on April 12. Rice output
may total 6 million tons, from 6.7 million tons last year.  
 September-delivery wheat jumped as much as 4.3 percent to
$6.90 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest level
since Oct. 1, 2008, and was at $6.8875 at 1:30 p.m. London time.
Prices jumped 38 percent in July, the biggest gainer of 24 raw
materials in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index.  
 Pakistan’s deadliest floods in decades claimed 1,200 lives
and the toll may rise as high as 3,000, said Mujahid Khan, a
spokesman for Pakistan’s independent Edhi rescue service in the
northwest city of Peshawar. The floods have affected a million
people overall, the United Nations says.
