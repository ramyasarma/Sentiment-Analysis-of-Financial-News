             Roman Haase, a spokesman for Lower
Saxony, declined to confirm or deny a Deutsche Presse-Agentur
report that the German state government may sell part of its
stake in Volkswagen AG.  
 “We do not confirm or deny rumors,” Haase said by
telephone today.  
 Lower Saxony plans to sell VW shares as part of the
government’s budget review, Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported,
without citing anyone. Lower Saxony owns a 20 percent stake in
Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW.  
 Lower Saxony Prime Minister David McAllister told Bloomberg
News in a June 24 interview that he stands “rock solid” behind
the state’s 20 percent stake in the automaker.
