             UBS AG downgraded the European
automobile industry to “underweight” from “neutral,” saying
the stocks have been “the best performing sector since April”
and “lead indicators are rolling over.”  
 The brokerage, which also noted that “earnings momentum is
at an 8-year high and may have peaked,” also lifted its stance
on the European insurance industry to “neutral” from “small
underweight,” according to a note today.  
 Insurance stocks have “underperformed year to date and
over the last 5 years,” a team of strategists lead by  Nick Nelson  wrote. “Earnings momentum is at a 20-year low and looks
to be turning at a time when the forward dividend yield is 5.5
percent compared with the market at 4.1 percent.”
