             Copper may rise to $7,615 a metric
ton within two weeks after breaking through its 200-day moving
average and a Fibonacci level, according to technical analysis
by Commerzbank AG.  
 The attached chart shows the metal rose above the 200-day
moving average and the 50 percent retracement of its decline,
one of the levels singled out in so-called Fibonacci analysis.
Prices may rise to $7,615 a ton, which would be a 78.6 percent
retracement of the April-to-June decline, London-based analyst
Karen Jones said on July 29.  
 “We should stretch up towards $7,615” and gains above
that level may push prices as high as this year’s high of
$8,043.75 on April 12, Jones said.  
 The second attached chart shows prices may retreat from
$7,615 because copper has fallen below a trend of higher prices
since at least March 2009, Jones said.  
 Copper for delivery in three months traded at $7,422 a ton
at 7:07 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange today. The metal rose
12 percent in July, paring this year’s loss to 1.1 percent.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
