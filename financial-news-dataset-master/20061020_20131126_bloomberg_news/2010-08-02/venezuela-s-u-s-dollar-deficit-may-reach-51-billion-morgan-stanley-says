             Venezuela’s dollar deficit over the
next two years may reach $51 billion as demand for foreign
currency outstrips oil export revenue, Morgan Stanley analyst
Daniel Volberg said today in an e-mailed report.  
 The government may sell $6 billion of foreign bonds this
year to supply import needs of private companies through a
central bank administered market and may eventually have to
choose between imports of goods and services or honoring debt
service obligations, Volberg said.
