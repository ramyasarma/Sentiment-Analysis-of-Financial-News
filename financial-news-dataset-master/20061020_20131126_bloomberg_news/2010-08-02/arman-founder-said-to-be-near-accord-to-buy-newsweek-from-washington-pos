             Sidney Harman , the founder of  Harman
International Industries Inc. , is near a deal to buy the money-
losing Newsweek magazine from  Washington Post Co. , three people
familiar with the matter said.  
 Harman, 91, was chosen over bids from  Fred Drasner , a former
executive at U.S. News & World Report and The New York Daily
News, and investment firm Avenue Capital Group, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the sale isn’t public yet.
It may be announced as soon as today, one person said.  
 Drasner said in an interview he has been told Post Co. is
near a deal with Harman.  
 “I wish him the best of luck,” Drasner said. “I’m
pleased somebody is going to devote this amount of resources to
preserve serious journalism.”  
 Post Co. said in May it was considering selling the weekly
news magazine it has owned since 1961. The circulation of
general interest newsmagazines, including Newsweek and  Time
Warner Inc. ’s Time, has plunged as more readers seek their news
from the Web, where stories are updated more frequently.  
 Donald Graham , chairman of the Post Co., and  Tom Kuhn ,
managing director at investment bank Allen & Co., which was
hired by Post Co. to manage the sale, couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment.  
 Two of the people said they didn’t know the price Harman is
paying for Newsweek. Harman agreed to keep most of the
magazine’s more than 300 employees on board once the sale is
complete, the people said. The Post Co. agreed to cover the
severance costs for any Newsweek employees the buyer didn’t
keep, making Harman’s bid more valuable, the people said.  
 Operating Losses  
 Newsweek posted losses from 2007 to 2009 and its
Washington-based owner predicted in May this year will be
unprofitable, too. Newsweek redesigned the magazine last year
and told advertisers it anticipated fewer guaranteed readers.  
 Post Co. rose $13.40, or 3.2 percent, to $433.89 at 4:04
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The stock has
lost 1.3 percent this year.  
 Harman, who resides in California, is chairman emeritus of
Harman International, the Stamford, Connecticut-based maker of
audio equipment including the Harman Kardon, Infinity and JBL
brands. He is married to U.S. Representative  Jane Harman , who
represents a Southern California district that includes Los
Angeles-area cities Rancho Palos Verdes, Torrance and Venice.  
 Since 2007, Newsweek has lost $44 million on an operating
basis, according to documents sent to prospective buyers. Print
advertising revenue plunged 39 percent to $70.3 million last
year from $115.5 million in 2008, the documents show.
