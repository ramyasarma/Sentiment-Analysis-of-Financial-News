             Air Liquide SA , the world’s biggest
producer of industrial gases, said first-half profit rose 13
percent as sales jumped and the company reduced spending.  
 Net income increased to 676 million euros ($884 million)
from 596 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company
said today in a statement. Sales climbed 9.7 percent to 6.52
billion euros. The average profit  estimate  was 658 million euros
in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  
 “Growth projects are picking up at a moderate pace in
mature economies, but at a sustained pace in emerging
economies,” Chief Executive Officer  Benoit Potier  said in the
statement. “The group’s portfolio of investments opportunities
is now back to its pre-crisis level.”  
 Potier is planning to cut costs by more than 200 million
euros this year and is favoring investment in expanding markets
such as China. He reiterated a goal that profit will rise “in
line with its long-term performance” this year.  
 The company said it’s sticking to a target for a  return  on
capital employed of 11 percent to 12 percent. The ratio was 11.8
percent in the first half, Chief Financial Officer  Fabienne Lecorvaisier  told journalists in Paris today.  
 Net debt rose 0.7 percent from a year earlier to
5.69 billion euros. The company is committed to keeping its A
 credit rating , Lecorvaisier said.
