             Maurizio Borletti , the owner of
Italy’s La Rinascente and France’s Printemps department stores,
made an approach for insolvent German competitor Karstadt AG,
seeking to trump Berggruen Holdings Ltd.  
 Borletti submitted the offer, worth 100 million euros
($131.8 million) on July 29 to administrator  Klaus Hubert Goerg ,
the Italian entrepreneur said in a telephone interview today.
U.S. retail liquidator Gordon Brothers Group LLC will finance
the deal, he said.  
 “Our offer is the best on the table for all parties
involved,” Borletti said, adding that his bid isn’t contingent
on closing stores, cutting wages or selling any of Karstadt’s
assets.  
 Berggruen signed a contract to acquire Karstadt on June 8
under the condition that Karstadt’s landlords grant lower rents.
The parties are still in negotiations. Karstadt’s administrator
won’t consider Borletti’s approach as long as those discussions
are ongoing, the administrator’s spokesman  Thomas Schulz  said
today by phone.  Wolfgang Weber-Thedy , a Berggruen spokesman,
declined to comment.  
 Borletti said he would like his offer to be considered if
Berggruen fails, as a “breakup is no alternative.” He won’t
take any money out of Karstadt within the next five years,
Borletti said.  
 The Italian holds a minority stake in the Highstreet
consortium, Karstadt’s main landlord.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
has a majority stake in the partnership.
