             The yen may advance during the
remainder of the year amid concern the recovery is slowing in
the U.S. and China, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said.  
 “The pace of economic recovery in the two largest
economies is losing upward momentum,” Lee Hardman, a London-
based foreign-exchange strategist, wrote in a note today.
“Given that both the U.S. and Chinese economies account for
around a third of world output in purchasing-power terms,
slowing momentum in those leading economies will inevitably
raise global-growth concerns helping to support safe haven
currencies such as the yen as the year progresses.”  
 The yen slipped 0.3 percent to 86.76 per dollar as of 9:27
a.m. in London. It has climbed 7.2 percent versus the U.S.
currency so far in 2010.
