             Qatar’s telecom regulator is “not
pursuing” any plan to ban Research In Motion Ltd.’s BlackBerry
services in the country, said Meegan Webb, acting assistant
secretary general of ictQatar.  
 The regulator hasn’t been contacted by local authorities
about BlackBerry services, Webb said in interview at her Doha
office today. “We have no intention at this point in time of
banning BlackBerry,” she said.  
 BlackBerry’s Messenger, e-mail and Web browsing services
will be suspended from Oct. 11 in the United Arab Emirates, the
country’s Telecommunications Regulatory Authority said
yesterday. “In their current form, certain BlackBerry services
allow users to act without any legal accountability, causing
judicial, social and national security concerns for the U.A.E.,”
it said.
