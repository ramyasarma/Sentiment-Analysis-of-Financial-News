             The number of jobs advertised on the
Internet in July rose to the highest level since November 2008,
a sign the labor market is recovering.  
 There were 4.29 million help-wanted ads posted online, up
3.4 percent, from 4.15 million in June, according to figures
from the Conference Board, a New York-based private research
group. All four U.S. regions posted gains, while 17 industries
registered increases, four declined and one was unchanged.  
 Companies are hiring as the recovery settles into a more
sustained pace. Private payrolls increased by 90,000 last month
and the unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent as more job
seekers probably joined the labor force, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before an Aug.
6 Labor Department report.  
 “Online job demand for the nation as a whole has settled
into a more modest pattern over the last six months, with
increases that have averaged about 43,000 per month,” said June
Shelp, vice president of the Conference Board in a statement.
“The gains in job demand vary.”  
 The gain in ads last month was led by the West, with
California showing a rise of 34,800. Management, office and
administrative support, and computer and mathematical science
occupations showed the biggest increases in positions offered.
