             Central Banks and politicians of
central and eastern European countries should get involved in
the Basel negotiations on banking supervision,  Hospodarske
Noviny  reported, citing Erste Group Bank AG’s Chairman Andreas
Treichl.  
 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s proposal on
how to redefine capital and when to impose borrowing caps on
banks worldwide could slow economies in the post-Communist
countries of central Europe, the newspaper said, citing an
interview with Treichl.  
 Capital reserves for loans should be smaller as the region
needs to fuel economic growth, Hospodarske reported Treichl as
saying.
