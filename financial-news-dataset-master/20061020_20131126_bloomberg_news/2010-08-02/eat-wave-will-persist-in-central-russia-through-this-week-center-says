             Hot weather that has damaged crops
and caused wildfires across Russia will persist in central
parts of the country and along the Volga at least through Aug.
7, the country’s weather center said.  
 Daytime temperatures will rise to as high as 42 degrees
Celsius (107.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in central Russia and along
the Volga, the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia said on its
 website  today. Similar temperatures will persist in the southern
Russia and the Caucasus through August 4, it said.  
 Russia is experiencing intensifying rural wildfires stoked
by a heat wave and strong winds, the country’s Emergency
Situations Ministry said yesterday. Fourteen regions have
declared a state of emergency after wildfires engulfed entire
villages, leaving 30 people dead and more than 2,000 homeless,
according to RIA Novosti.  
 The government also declared emergencies in 27 crop-
producing regions because of the worst drought in at least a
decade.
