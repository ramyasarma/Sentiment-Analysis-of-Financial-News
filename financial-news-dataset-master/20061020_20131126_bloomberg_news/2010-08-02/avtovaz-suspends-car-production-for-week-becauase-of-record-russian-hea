             OAO AvtoVAZ , Russia’s largest
automaker, suspended production because of record heat in
Togliatti, southern Russia, the carmaker said in an e-mailed
 statement  late July 30.  
 Production will remain suspended from today through Aug.
8, as temperatures are expected to exceed 45 degrees Celsius
(113 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the statement.  
 “Despite significant demand for Lada cars, it is not
possible to continue producing vehicles in such weather
conditions,” the automaker said. “The shutdown for one week
is an optimal way to keep the health and further the working
efficiency of employees.”
