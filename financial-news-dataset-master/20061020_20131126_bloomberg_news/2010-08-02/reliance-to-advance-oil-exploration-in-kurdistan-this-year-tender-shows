             Reliance Industries Ltd. , owner of
the world’s largest refining complex, plans to advance
exploration at two oil blocks in Kurdistan this year.  
 Reliance, controlled by billionaire  Mukesh Ambani , invited
contractors to bid for work to begin extended well testing at
its Rovi and Sarta blocks starting in the fourth quarter, a
tender document shows. The studies help evaluate the
productivity of a reservoir by estimating the oil and gas it
contains and how much can be extracted.  
 Manoj Warrier , a spokesman for Mumbai-based Reliance,
declined to comment today on which companies have been selected.
The company didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking details of the
tender, which closed July 21.  
 Oil exports from Kurdistan, a semi-autonomous region in
northern Iraq, have been suspended since October when
authorities in Baghdad declared contracts signed between the
Kurdistan Regional Government and foreign companies illegal.  
 Reliance holds 102,000 square kilometers of overseas oil
and gas acreage in 14 blocks, including in Peru, Yemen, Oman,
Australia and Kurdistan. One block in Yemen is producing 4,600
barrels a day, the company said in a July 27 statement.
