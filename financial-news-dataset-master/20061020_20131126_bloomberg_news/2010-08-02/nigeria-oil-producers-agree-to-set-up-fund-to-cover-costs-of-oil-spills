             International oil companies operating
in Nigeria’s Niger Delta region agreed to set up a fund to cover
the costs of oil spills, the country’s environment minister
said.  
 There were about 3,000 reported cases of spills between
2006 and 2010 in the delta region, where most of Nigeria’s oil
fields are located, minister  John Odey  said in a statement e-
mailed by the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency.  
 Nigeria is Africa’s top oil producer and the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. oil imports.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Exxon Mobil
Corp., Chevron Corp., Total SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures
with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. to pump
the country’s crude.  
 State governors from the southern oil-producing region in
June asked President Goodluck Jonathan’s government to implement
tougher regulations on energy companies, saying that oil-spills
and pollution have caused extensive damage to the environment.  
 Energy companies say most of the spills recorded in the
delta in recent years were caused by criminal gangs who steal
crude from pipelines.
