             China’s stocks  rose, extending the
best monthly gain in a year, on the prospect the government will
reverse policies aimed at slowing the world’s third-biggest
economy after manufacturing expanded the least in 17 months.  
 China Shenhua Energy Co.  and China Coal Energy Co. paced
gains among coal producers after a large coal field was found in
northeastern China. Beijing Yanjing Brewery Co. led advances
among consumer stocks after first-half earnings increased 25
percent.  Suning Appliance Co. , China’s biggest home appliance
retailer by market value, climbed to the highest in more than
six months after reporting higher first-half profit.  
 “The market has reached a consensus view that the
government will ease current measures to rein in economic growth
as data show growth is already slowing down,” said  Wang Zheng ,
a fund manager at Jingxi Investment Management Co. in Shanghai.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, gained 35.01, or 1.3 percent, to
2,672.52 at the 3 p.m. close, the highest since May 24. The  CSI
300 Index  rose 1.7 percent to 2,917.27, led by consumer and
health-care companies.  
 The Shanghai index rallied 10 percent last month, the most
since July last year when it gained 15 percent, on expectations
the government will ease property curbs and allow more lending
to offset a slowdown in economic growth. The measure is still
down 18 percent in 2010 on concern measures to control real-
estate speculation and accelerating inflation will damp earnings.  
 Manufacturing Slowdown  
 The  Purchasing Managers’ Index  fell to 51.2 in July from
52.1 in June, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said on
its website yesterday. That was the lowest since China’s
manufacturing stopped contracting in March 2009 and was less
than the median forecast of 51.4 in a Bloomberg News  survey  of
15 economists. A reading above 50 shows an expansion.  
 Another purchasing managers’ index released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics fell to 49.4 in July from 50.4
a month earlier, the first contraction in 16 months.  
 “The government’s tightening policies have already
achieved the desired effect,” said  Zhang Kun , a strategist at
Guotai Junan Securities Co. in Shanghai. “There won’t be any
intensified measures going forward. The market can breathe a
sigh of relief.’  
 China’s full-year economic growth may be about 9.5 percent,
State Council researcher  Zhang Liqun  said in the statement
released yesterday with the official manufacturing PMI figure
for July. The economy expanded 10.3 percent in the second
quarter, slowing from an 11.9 percent growth a quarter earlier.  
 ‘Visible Softening’  
 Morgan Stanley said in a report it expects a “visible
softening in policy tone” in the third quarter and the
government to introduce measures to bolster economic growth in
the fourth quarter.  
 China has increased banks’ reserve requirements three times
this year and set a lending target of 7.5 trillion yuan for
lenders in order to curb asset bubbles in the nation’s economy.  
 Shenhua, the nation’s largest coal producer, rose 1.4
percent to 24.07 yuan. China Coal, the second biggest, gained
1.8 percent to 10.03 yuan.  Datong Coal Industry Co. , the third
largest, added 2 percent to 16.44 yuan.  
 China discovered more than 1 billion tons of coal reserves
in the northeastern Liaoning Province, the People’s Daily online
reported yesterday, citing a local government release. It is the
largest coal field found in northeastern regions in almost two
decades, the newspaper said.  
 A gauge of consumer discretionary stocks gained 2.1 percent
in the CSI 300, while a measure of consumer staples rose 3.2
percent.  
 Rising prices may boost the earnings of makers of consumer
goods. Inflation, which eased to 2.9 percent in June, may climb
above 3 percent in the next few months before falling at the end
of this year, UBS economist  Wang Tao  wrote in a report last week.  
 Beverage Makers  
 Yanjing Brewery, China’s third-biggest brewer, rose 5
percent to 21.58 yuan after the company said net income for the
first half climbed 25 percent from a year earlier.  
 Kweichow Moutai Co., the biggest producer of baijiu liquor
by market value, rose 3.5 percent to 143.55 yuan.  YOUR-MART Co. ,
an operator of department stores, gained 2.4 percent to 23.38
yuan, the highest close since the stock began trading on July 17.  
 Suning Appliance , China’s biggest home appliance retailer
by market value, gained 2.5 percent to 12.81 yuan, the highest
since Jan. 19, after saying first-half profit rose 56 percent
from a year earlier.  
 China-listed companies posted a 50 percent gain in net
income on average in the first half, the Shanghai Securities
News reported, citing 264 companies that have released earnings
results as of July 31.  
 Wave of Gains  
 The  Shanghai Composite  may be set for another “wave” of
gains after completing a so-called correction that lasted for
almost a year, according to Elliott Wave International Inc.  
 The Shanghai index capped a three-wave decline in early
July and has turned higher near the 61.8 percent  retracement  of
its 2008 to 2009 rally according to the Fibonacci sequence, the
research company said. That also coincided with the lower line
of the  trend channel  that had contained the decline from its
August 2009 high.  
 China’s stocks may outperform global markets in the next
three months as valuations are “very cheap,” liquidity
improves and the threat of further policy tightening recedes,
according to Nomura Holdings Inc.’s equity strategist  Sean Darby .  
 Essence Securities Co., ranked second for strategy research
by New Fortune magazine last year, said it’s turning negative on
the nation’s shares because of inflation concerns.  
 The following companies were among the most active in
China’s markets. Stock symbols are in brackets after companies’
names.  
 Dalian Yi Qiao Marine Seeds Co.  (002447 CH) surged by the
10 percent daily limit to 49.61 yuan after saying first-half
profit rose 17 percent from a year ago.  
 Shanghai Qiangsheng Holding Co.  (600662 CH) gained 8.8
percent to 7.69 yuan. The company, which resumed trading after a
two-month suspension, said it plans to sell about 245 million
shares in a private placement at 7.03 yuan each. It’s raising
funds to buy assets from its two largest shareholders.  
 Shenzhen Airport Co.  (000089 CH) added 2.7 percent to 6.03
yuan. The company said first-half profit rose 29 percent from
year-earlier levels. Separately, the stock was raised to
“overweight” from “equal-weight” by Morgan Stanley analysts
led by  Edward Xu .  
 Tangshan Sanyou Chemical Industries Co.  (600409 CH) jumped
by the 10 percent daily cap to 6.31 yuan. The company said it
will sell 121 million shares to its parent and an affiliate to
take control of two chemical fiber units valued at a combined
720.5 million yuan, according to a stock exchange filing. The
stock resumed trading today after a one-month suspension.
