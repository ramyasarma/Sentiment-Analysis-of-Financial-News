             India’s  bonds  fell, pushing the 10-
year yield to a three-month high, as overnight borrowing rates
in the local money market climbed and the government announced
plans to step up short-term debt sales this week.  
 The benchmark 10-year bonds declined for a fifth day, the
longest losing streak in two months, after the government said
it will auction 85 billion rupees ($1.8 billion) of treasury
bills this week. That’s almost triple the 30 billion rupees of
notes sold last week. The cost of borrowing funds overnight in
the interbank market touched a four-week high of 6.05 percent,
deterring lenders from buying debt with borrowed funds.  
 “There are clearly more reasons to sell in the present set
of liquidity and demand-supply conditions,” said  Anoop Verma , a
fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank in Mumbai. “The
pressure on bond yields to rise is intensifying.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent bond due in May 2020 rose six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.86 percent as of
the 5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. That’s the highest  level  since the notes began
trading on May 3. The price fell 0.42, or 42 paise per 100 rupee
face amount, to 99.55.  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose to the highest since November 2008. The rate, a fixed
payment made to receive floating rates, increased to 6.46
percent from 6.37 percent at the end of last week.  
 Bonds also fell as a report showed India’s manufacturing
growth accelerated in July, increasing pressure on the central
bank to add to the four interest-rate increases announced so far
this year. The  Reserve Bank of India  last raised its overnight
borrowing rate July 27 by 0.5 percentage point to 4.5 percent.  
 The Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 57.6 from 57.3 in
June, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in an e-mailed
statement today. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
