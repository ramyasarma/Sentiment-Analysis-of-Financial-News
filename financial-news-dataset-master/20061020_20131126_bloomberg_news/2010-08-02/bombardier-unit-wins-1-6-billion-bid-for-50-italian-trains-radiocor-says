             Ansaldobreda SpA, a unit of
Finmeccanica SpA, and Canada’s Bombardier Inc. won a 1.2
billion-euro ($1.6 billion) contract to build 50 high-speed
trains for Italy’s state-controlled railway company, news agency
Radiocor reported, without citing anyone.  
 Ansaldobreda and Bombardier were chosen over Alstom SA
based on a combination of price and the technical project
offered, Radiocor said today.
