             The rate that European banks say they
see each other borrowing at for three months in euros rose to
0.898 percent today, from 0.896 percent at the end of last week.  
 The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for such loans
fell for the first time in more than three months on July 30
after reaching a one-year high of 0.899 percent on July 29.  
 The Euribor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to
lend, fell one basis point to 34 basis points as of 10:15 a.m.
in London.
