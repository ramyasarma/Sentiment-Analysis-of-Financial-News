             The pound may reach $1.5970, the
highest in almost six months, should it breach a key technical
level, according to analysts at Commerzbank AG.  
 Sterling, which broke above its 200-day moving average last
week, “meets resistance at $1.5836, the top of its short-term
channel,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and
currency technical analysis in London, said today.  
 A sustained break above that level “targets $1.5970, the
61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the decline from $1.7044
in August 2009 to the May 2010 low at $1.4225,” Jones said in a
telephone interview.  
 The pound gained 0.7 percent to $1.5794 as of 10 a.m. in
London, having advanced to $1.5808 earlier, the highest level
since Feb. 17. It last surpassed $1.5970 on Feb. 3.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance is a level where sell
orders may be clustered, and so-called support is where buy
orders may be grouped. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory
that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a
high or low.
