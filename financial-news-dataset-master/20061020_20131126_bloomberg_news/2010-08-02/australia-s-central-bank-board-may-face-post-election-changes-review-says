             The Reserve Bank of Australia’s six
external board members will all face re-appointment during the
next federal government term, the Australian Financial Review
reported. The appointments will be made over the next three
years, marking the first time since the central bank was
established 50 years ago that the six expire during a single
parliamentary term, the newspaper said.
