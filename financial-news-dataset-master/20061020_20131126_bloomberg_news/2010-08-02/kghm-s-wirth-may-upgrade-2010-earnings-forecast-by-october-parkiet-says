             KGHM Polska Miedz SA , Poland’s only
copper producer, will publish an updated forecast of 2010
earnings in September or October, Chief Executive Officer
 Herbert Wirth  told  Parkiet .  
 He said on June 17 that the company may upgrade 2010
forecasts because of the zloty’s weakness.  
 He also said KGHM seeks to complete the purchase of
another, “slightly bigger,” copper deposit in Canada as early
as this year after buying in May the Afton Ajax deposit, which
yields 50,000 tons a year. Wirth said talks on the price haven’t
yet started.  
 Separately, Wirth said Polkomtel SA shareholders, including
KGHM with a 24.4 percent stake, are still working on due-
diligence scrutiny before offering Poland’s biggest wireless
company to potential investors, Parkiet reported.
