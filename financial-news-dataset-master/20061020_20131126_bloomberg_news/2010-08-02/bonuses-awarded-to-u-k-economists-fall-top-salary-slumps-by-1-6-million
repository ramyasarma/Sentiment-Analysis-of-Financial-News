             U.K. economists’  bonuses fell by
almost a third on average last year and the pay of the
profession’s top earner slumped by almost 1 million pounds ($1.6
million), a survey by the Society of Business Economists showed.  
 The average bonus in an annual study of economist salaries
in January was 30,500 pounds, compared with 44,700 pounds a year
earlier, the society said in its Business Economist periodical
published last week. The top earner was an asset-management
employee who got 550,000 pounds, down from the 1.5 million
pounds clinched by an investment-bank worker in the 2009 survey.  
 Rising bank bonuses sparked criticism from lawmakers after
the U.K. provided more than 1 trillion pounds to prop up lenders
including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc during the financial
crisis. The former Labour government raised 2.5 billion pounds
after introducing a one-time 50 percent levy in December on
bonuses paid by banks that exceeded 25,000 pounds.  
 “Despite all the fuss about ‘bankers’ bonuses,’ pretty
much the same proportion of respondents overall received a bonus
last year as in the year before,” Jim Hirst, editor of the
Business Economist, wrote in the report. Still, the average was
“well down on last year and the average bonus reported for
those in investment banking was only two-thirds of the average
in our last survey.”  
 The median annual base salary rose 2.8 percent from a year
earlier to 80,000 pounds, the survey showed. The median total
cash compensation declined to 90,000 pounds from 92,900 pounds a
year earlier.  
 Recession Year  
 “Business economists’ earnings held up well in a year when
recession took hold,” Hirst said. “All in all, business
economists fared about the same as employees generally.”  
 The society received 90 responses for its 2010 survey,
fewer than the previous year’s 98, and that is so small a sample
that the findings “may not be representative of business
economists’ experience,” Hirst said.  
 “It remains the case that even the reduced average level
of bonuses still reflects a small number of very large
bonuses,” Hirst said. Out of the 63 respondents who reported
receiving a bonus, the average was 15,100 pounds excluding the
seven payouts that exceeded 100,000 pounds.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc  said today that the one-off bonus tax,
which covered payouts awarded between Dec. 9, 2009 and April 5,
cost Europe’s biggest bank about $91 million. Morgan Stanley,
the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, said last month the tax
cost it about $361 million. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, paid a charge of about
$600 million tied to the tax in the second quarter and Citigroup
Inc. said it paid $400 million.
