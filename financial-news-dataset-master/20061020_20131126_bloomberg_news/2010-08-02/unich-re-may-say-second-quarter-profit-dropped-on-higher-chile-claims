             Munich Re , the world’s biggest
reinsurer, may say second-quarter profit declined as it had to
raise reserves for claims resulting from the earthquake that hit
Chile in February.  
 Net income attributable to shareholders probably fell to
475 million euros ($621 million) from 685 million euros in the
year-earlier period, according to the median estimate of 11
 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The company on June 8 raised its claims projection for the
quake in Chile to about $1 billion from a previous estimate of
$700 million. The Munich-based reinsurer, led by Chief Executive
Officer  Nikolaus von Bomhard , has said its full-year profit
forecast for  net income before minority interests  of more than 2
billion euros has become “even more ambitious” following the
claims revision.  
 Insurers’ losses from natural catastrophes totaled $22
billion in the first half of 2010, more than double the average
for the period since 2000, Munich Re said on July 7. The 2010
Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June through
November, may be the most active since 2005, which was the worst
on record with $115 billion in damage, according to Moody’s
Investors Service. The current season has seen two named storms
so far, with one of them reaching hurricane strength.  
 The Deepwater Horizon oil rig that caught fire and sank in
the Gulf of Mexico may result in a material-damage burden of
about 60 million euros, while total claims including liability
coverage are expected at “a low triple-digit million-euro amount
at most,” Munich Re said in May.  
 Share Buyback  
 The company resumed plans to buy back as much as 1 billion
euros of its own shares by the 2011 shareholders’ meeting to woo
 investors , including  Warren Buffett  and his  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc.  as well as asset manager  BlackRock Inc.   
 Investment income at the reinsurer probably rose to 2.24
billion euros in the second quarter from 2.19 billion euros in
the year-earlier period, according to analysts’ estimates.  
 The following is a table of projections and year-earlier
figures. Munich Re revised last year’s numbers to reflect
changes in reporting standards and in its segment reporting. The
figures, except the combined ratio, are in millions of euros.
The reinsurer is scheduled to report results on Aug. 4 before
stock markets open in Germany.
