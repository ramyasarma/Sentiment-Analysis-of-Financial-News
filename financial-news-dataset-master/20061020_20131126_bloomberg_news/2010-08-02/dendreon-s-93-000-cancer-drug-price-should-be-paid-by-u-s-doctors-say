             Dendreon Inc. ’s $93,000 price tag for
its Provenge prostate cancer treatment must be covered under the
rules of the U.S. Medicare health plan, according to a letter
submitted by the  American Society of Clinical Oncology .  
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the
government agency that determines which treatments will be
reimbursed, is required by the Social Security Act to pay for
all cancer drugs approved by U.S. regulators, the cancer society
said in a  public letter  submitted to the agency.  
 Provenge won marketing rights in the U.S. in April,
becoming the first drug designed to train the body’s immune
system to fight cancer.  Medicare , the government’s health plan
for the elderly and disabled, routinely pays for medicines once
they’ve been approved regardless of price. The agency initiated
a yearlong internal review on June 30 to determine whether
Provenge should be an exception.  
 “We are concerned that CMS may have plans to examine the
issue of whether to cover this therapy for its FDA-approved
indications,” the Alexandria, Virginia-based cancer society
said in a letter posted on a CMS website for public comments.
“This would be both counter-productive and ill-advised.”  
 Dendreon rose 93 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $33.84 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The
stock has declined 33 percent since the drug was approved on
April 29.  
 28,000 Doctors  
 The American Society of Clinical Oncology represents 28,000
cancer doctors and medical practitioners. The group holds the
world’s biggest annual meeting devoted to cancer drug research.  
 Treatment with Provenge costs about $93,000 for three doses
administered over the course of a month. The medicine helped
patients live about 4.1 months longer than those given a
placebo, according to tests used to gain approval.  
 Before the review was announced,  Don McLeod , an agency
spokesman, said Provenge would almost certainly be covered by
Medicare. He declined to comment today on the review.  
 The agency doesn’t typically make formal determinations on
cancer drugs. Instead, it pays claims through the local
contractors who administer payments.  
 “Under any scenario, we urge CMS to provide clear public
statements regarding Medicare’s current policies governing the
coverage of this therapy,” ASCO said in the comments to
Medicare. “Ambiguity and uncertainty regarding coverage
policies can act as an unacceptable barrier to medically
necessary care.”
