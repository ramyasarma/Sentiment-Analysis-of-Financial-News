             Lookin At Lucky won horse racing’s
$1 million Haskell Invitational, pulling away from the field at
New Jersey’s Monmouth Park to stake a claim as the top 3-year-
old thoroughbred in North America.  
 Lookin At Lucky, which won the Preakness Stakes in May,
finished four lengths ahead of Trappe Shot to give Hall of Fame
trainer  Bob Baffert  his fourth Haskell win.  
 “He’s been sitting on a really good race,” Baffert,
whose horse was the 6-5 favorite, said in a televised
interview. “It’s great to see him finally come out of his
shell. He’s stamped himself as the great horse he really is.”  
 Trappe Shot, which was purchased last year by former U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Nicholas Brady , was followed by Preakness
runner-up First Dude and Kentucky Derby winner Super Saver in
the seven-horse field.  
 It was the first time in the Haskell’s 43-year history
that the race featured Kentucky Derby and Preakness winners.  
 Lookin At Lucky, ridden by jockey Martin Garcia, recovered
from a stumble at the start and moved to the front of the pack
alongside Super Saver and Trappe Shot at the final turn.  
 The colt took the lead at the top of the straight and
pulled away to finish in a time of 1 minute, 49.83 seconds.  
 “He finally got to show off,” Lookin At Lucky co-owner
Mike Pegram told ABC. “Bobby has always told us what kind of
horse we have and I’m so happy we got to see it.”
