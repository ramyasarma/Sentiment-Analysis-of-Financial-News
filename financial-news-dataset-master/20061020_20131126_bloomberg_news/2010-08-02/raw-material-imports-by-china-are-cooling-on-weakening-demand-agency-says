             China’s weaker domestic demand is
cooling raw-material imports, the statistics bureau said today,
commenting on a contraction in an import sub-index in
yesterday’s manufacturing data.  
 The bureau also said that a decline in the export-order
index reflects a slowing U.S. economy and Europe’s debt crisis.
The bureau commented on its website today.  
 Energy efficiency measures caused a second large monthly
decline in the output of the metal-processing industries in
July, the bureau said.
