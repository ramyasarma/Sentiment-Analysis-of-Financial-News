               Wilmar International Ltd ., the
world’s largest palm oil trader, approached banks for about $1.1
billion of loans to buy  CSR Ltd .’s Australian sugar unit,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  
 The mixed-maturity term facility, in both Australian and
U.S. dollars, will pay an all-in fee averaging about 100 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate, the people
said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private.  
 Wilmar, based in Singapore, agreed to buy CSR’s Sucrogen
Ltd. unit for A$1.75 billion ($1.59 billion) last month, beating
a bid from  China ’s Bright Food Group Co. The acquisition will
allow Wilmar to “create synergies and pursue growth strategies
in  Indonesia  and other high potential Asian markets,” Wilmar
said in a  statement  on July 5.  
 The company said on July 5 that the acquisition will be
funded from internal resources and by borrowing from banks.
Wilmar has about $1.4 billion of bonds and loans maturing by the
end of 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Wilmar investor relations head Lim Li Chuen declined to
comment today. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
