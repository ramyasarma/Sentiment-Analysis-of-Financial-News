             German natural gas and power sales
rose in the first half of the year as higher industrial output
and a colder winter boosted demand, the BDEW utility group said.  
 Energy suppliers sold 532 terawatt-hours of gas in the
first six months of 2010, up from 466 terawatt-hours in the same
period a year earlier, the Berlin-based association said today
on its website. Power sales climbed to 274 terawatt-hours from
262 terawatt-hours.  
 Industrial energy users account for 40 to 45 percent of gas
and power demand, according to the statement. The amount of gas
fired in power plants increased about 20 percent in the period,
the BDEW said, citing preliminary data.
