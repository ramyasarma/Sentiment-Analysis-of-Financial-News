             Hammerson Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest real estate investment trust, reported a first-half
profit after the value of its properties grew.  
 Net income was 333 million pounds ($524 million), or 47.3
pence a share, compared with a loss of 786.1 million pounds a
year earlier, the London-based company said in a statement
today. Net asset value increased by 7.8 percent to 4.54 pounds a
share.  
 Hammerson has been disposing of assets to bolster its
balance sheet as the market begins to recover from a slump that
saw values drop by 44 percent in the two years from mid-2007. In
June, the company agreed to sell an office tower in London’s
Docklands area for 134 million pounds and a stake in a Paris
shopping mall for 176 million euros.  
 Hammerson owns about 5.1 billion pounds worth of properties
in the U.K. and France, according to its  website . That includes
more than 1.6 million square meters (17.2 million square feet)
of shops and about 170,000 square meters of offices.
