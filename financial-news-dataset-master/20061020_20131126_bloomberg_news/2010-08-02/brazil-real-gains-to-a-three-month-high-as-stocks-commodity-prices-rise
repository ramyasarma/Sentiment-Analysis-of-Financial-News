             Brazil’s real strengthened to a
three-month high as stocks and commodities rose, boosting
speculation demand for the nation’s exports will grow.  
 The real gained 0.4 percent to 1.7485 per dollar at 9:19
a.m. New York time, from 1.7549 on July 30. Earlier the currency
touched 1.7458, the strongest on an intraday basis since May 4.  
 “The real’s strength is a mix of equity sentiment being
very positive and global commodities having a strong day,” said
 Mike Moran , a senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered
Plc in New York.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.4
percent. The U.S. is Brazil’s second-biggest trading partner
after China. Oil rose to the highest level in almost three
months, and the UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index
of 26 raw materials jumped as much as 1.6 percent.  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 10.77 percent, after declining for five
straight days.
