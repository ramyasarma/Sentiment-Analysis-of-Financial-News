             Japan’s wages rose for a fourth month
as employers had staff work more hours instead of adding to
payrolls, a trend that may sustain the recovery without reducing
the economy’s reliance on exports to propel growth.  
 Monthly wages  including overtime and bonuses increased 1.5
percent in June from a year earlier to 437,677 yen ($5,050), the
Labor Ministry said today in Tokyo.  
 A gradual rebound in salaries will help support consumer
spending in coming months, according to economist  Yoshimasa Maruyama . That will reduce the damage from a lack of job gains
after figures last week showed the  unemployment rate  rose to a
seven-month high, driven by a lack of positions for young people.  
 “Recent increases in overtime pay reflect the economic
recovery,” Maruyama, a senior economist at Itochu Corp. in
Tokyo, said before today’s report. “But companies are holding
off on meaningfully increasing personnel costs” until the
economic outlook becomes clearer, he said.  
 Special pay, a category that includes bonuses, gained 3.3
percent to 173,851 yen, today’s report showed. Mid-year bonuses
at large companies rose for the first time in three years,
according to business lobby Keidanren.  
 While overtime hours climbed for a sixth month on a year-
on-year basis, the figure for manufacturers dropped from a month
earlier, reflecting a recent stalling of  production . Factory
output slumped 1.5 percent in June, the biggest decline in more
than a year, the Trade Ministry said last week.
