             (Corrects Pakistan’s imports in sixth paragraph.)  
 White sugar fell for the first time
in six sessions in London on speculation importers may delay
purchases after the biggest monthly climb in 21 years.  
 The sweetener jumped 25 percent last month, the most since
June 1989. White sugar’s 14-day relative strength index, a gauge
of whether a commodity is overbought or oversold, has spent
almost two weeks above the level of 70 that signals a potential
impending price drop to some analysts and investors who study
technical charts.  
 “We are nearing a risky price area where we might see more
selling and less buying from some destinations deferring their
demand,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker and analyst at Rolle,
Switzerland-based Swiss Sugar Brokers, said in a report dated
July 31.  
 White sugar for October delivery dropped $3.70, or 0.6
percent, to $582 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe at 1:01 p.m. in
London. The RSI climbed to 81.521 on July 30, data compiled by
Bloomberg shows. Raw sugar for October delivery rose 1.1 percent
to 19.78 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  
 Still, a larger-than-expected purchase of white sugar by
Pakistan will be “bullish to the market,” Beydoun said by
phone today. State-run Pakistan Trading Corp. said today it
bought 320,000 tons of the sweetener. The country had tendered
for 200,000 tons over the weekend, according to Swiss Sugar
Brokers.  
 Pakistani Imports  
 Pakistan bought the sugar from Singapore’s Agrocorp
International Pte. and Sucden for $724.95 a ton, Chairman Sheikh
Anjum Bashir said by phone today. The country may need to import
as much as 700,000 tons of sugar by September to help meet
demand and cut domestic prices, Iskander Khan, chairman of the
Pakistan Sugar Mills Association said last month.  
 Cocoa for December delivery fell 16 pounds, or 0.7 percent,
to 2,257 pounds ($3,570) a ton in London. The chocolate
ingredient for September delivery slid $16, or 0.5 percent, to
$3,075 a ton in New York.  
 Robusta coffee for September delivery dropped $9, or 0.5
percent, to $1,810 a ton in London. Arabica beans for delivery
in the same month added 1 cent, or 0.6 percent, to $1.773 a
pound in New York.
