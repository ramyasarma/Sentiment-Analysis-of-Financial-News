             Blockbuster Inc. , the money-losing
movie-rental chain, won a judge’s ruling that it doesn’t
infringe a patent owned by  American Patent Development Corp. LLC 
for video-on-demand technology.  
 The Dallas-based company and its Movielink unit, of Santa
Monica, California, were sued in 2007 over the 1995 patent.  
 U.S. District Judge  Joseph J. Farnan Jr.  in Wilmington,
Delaware, issued the order July 30, based on descriptions of the
invention in a previous ruling on Movielink.  
 The company said in March it was seeking to refinance its
 debt  and could be forced into bankruptcy protection. Blockbuster
Inc. said it will report second-quarter financial results Aug.
12.  
 Officials at American Patent Development declined to
comment on the ruling.  
 Blockbuster spokeswoman Patty Sullivan said she was
unfamiliar with the decision and couldn’t immediately comment.  
 Shares of Blockbuster, which have fallen 73 percent this
year, fell less than 1 cent to 17 cents in over-the-counter
trading at 12:01 p.m. The stock traded at $1.56 last Sept. 27.
