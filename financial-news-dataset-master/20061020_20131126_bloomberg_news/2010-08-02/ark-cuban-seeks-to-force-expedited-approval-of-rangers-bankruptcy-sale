             Mark Cuban , the Dallas Mavericks
owner, sought to force Major League Baseball to speed up its
process for approving him as the buyer of the Texas Rangers if
he wins an auction for the baseball team.  
 Cuban needs expedited approval because he must close the
sale by Aug. 16 if he is the successful bidder at the auction
this week, his lawyers said today in court papers in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Fort Worth, Texas.  
 Major League Baseball, which must approve any new owner of
the Rangers, can speed up its approval process, “but, for
reasons unknown, appears wholly unwilling to do so” Cuban’s
lawyers wrote.  
 The Rangers are scheduled to go on the auction block on
Wednesday. Cuban and Houston businessman  Jim Crane  have said
they intend to bid for team and compete against a rival bid from
a group led by team president  Nolan Ryan  and attorney  Chuck Greenberg .  
 Cuban said Major League Baseball has agreed to speed up its
approval process for the Greenberg-Ryan group, which will meet
with baseball officials on Aug. 9. If Cuban wins, approval could
take up to nine months, he said.  
 Patrick Courtney , a spokesman for Major League Baseball,
couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  
 The case is In re Texas Rangers Baseball Partners, 10-
43400, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort
Worth).
