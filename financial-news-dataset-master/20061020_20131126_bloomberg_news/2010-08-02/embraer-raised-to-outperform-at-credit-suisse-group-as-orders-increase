             Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA ,
the world’s fourth-largest planemaker, was raised to
“outperform” from “underperform” at Credit Suisse Group AG,
which said earnings will benefit as the company wins orders amid
growing global air traffic.  
 “After several quarters of declining backlog and tough
revenue and margin environment, we think ERJ is entering into a
more benign environment,” analysts led by Luiz Otavio Campos
wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday, referring to
Embraer, as the company is known.
