             Copper futures in London, Shanghai
and New York jumped to the highest level in three months as a
rally in equities boosted investor confidence that the global
economic recovery is gaining momentum.  
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange climbed for a fourth day, by as much as 1.8 percent to
$7,427 a metric ton, the highest price since April 30. It traded
at $7,383 at 4:10 p.m. in Singapore.  
 “The overall sentiment on copper is rather bullish now,
given the recent gains in Asian stocks,” Lai Qiwen, an analyst
at Guantong Futures Co., said from Beijing today.  
 November copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange jumped as
much as 3.1 percent to 58,030 yuan ($8,567) a ton, the highest
price since May 4, before closing at 57,590 yuan. The contract
for September delivery on the Comex in New York gained as much
as 1.7 percent to $3.3660 a pound, the highest since May 3.  
 “The continued slowdown in China’s manufacturing is being
ignored for now,” said  Zeng Chao , an analyst at Everbright
Futures Co.  
 Asian stocks  rose for the sixth time in seven days as
companies reported higher earnings or forecasts, shrugging off a
report yesterday that showed China’s manufacturing grew at the
slowest pace in 17 months in July.  
 A decline in domestic inventories also “boosts
sentiment,” said Lai. Copper  stockpiles  in Shanghai last week
declined to 104,507 tons, the lowest level in six months.  
 China’s Growth  
 Still, China’s full-year economic growth may be about 9.5
percent, up from 9.1 percent in 2009, State Council researcher
 Zhang Liqun  said yesterday. Copper had its best month in a year
in July, rising 12 percent, on expectations the Chinese
government will ease tightening measures as the economy slows.  
 In Indonesia, workers at Newmont Mining Corp.’s Batu Hijau
gold and copper mine began a strike today. Production at the
Indonesian unit of the largest U.S. gold producer hasn’t been
affected by the walkout, which began at midnight, Kasan Mulyono,
a spokesman at PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara, said by phone from the
mine on Indonesia’s Sumbawa island.  
 Aluminum in London rose 0.7 percent to $2,190.75 a ton,
zinc rose 0.5 percent to $2,035.50 a ton, and lead gained 2
percent to $2,118.50 a ton. Nickel climbed 2 percent to $21,584
a ton, and tin gained 1.6 percent to $19,825 a ton at 4:16 p.m.
in Singapore.
