             NMDC Ltd. , Asia’s third-largest iron
ore miner, reported first-quarter profit almost doubled, its
biggest advance in earnings in four years, after prices for the
steelmaking ingredient rose.  
 Net income  rose to 15 billion rupees ($325 million), or
3.79 rupees a share, in the three months ended June 30, from
7.74 billion rupees, or 1.95 rupees a share, a year earlier, the
Hyderabad, India-based company said today in a statement to the
Bombay Stock Exchange. That exceeds the 12 billion rupee average
 estimate  of five analysts compiled by Bloomberg News and is the
biggest quarterly profit gain for the company since the three
months ended June 30, 2006, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Iron ore prices more than doubled in the first quarter
following a surge in steel demand. NMDC in March forecast record
profit this fiscal year as demand from construction companies
and automobile companies boost prices for the commodity.  
 NMDC rose 1.3 rupees, or 0.5 percent, to 262.15 rupees at
the 3:30 p.m. close of trade in Mumbai. The  stock  has slumped 38
percent this year, compared with the 3.5 percent advance in the
benchmark  Sensitive Index .  
 The company said on July 6 profit in the quarter gained
about 80 percent, while sales rose 90 percent, after higher
demand from steelmakers led to an increase in volume and prices.  
 Sales rose to 25.2 billion in the quarter, from 12.8
billion a year earlier, NMDC said today.
