Hansen Transmissions International
NV , a maker of wind-turbine gearboxes, fell the most in 11
months in London trading after saying it expects revenue to
decline this fiscal year.  Hansen dropped as much as 9.3 pence, or 18 percent, to a
record-low 41 pence, the biggest intraday decline since
November and traded at 42 pence as of 8:47 a.m., valuing the
Antwerp, Belgium-based company at 281.4 million pounds ($443
million).  “The operating environment will remain challenging for
the next two quarters, being the last two quarters of the
financial year 2011,” the company said in a statement today.
Hansen said revenue for the 12 months through March will fall
about 10 percent compared with the 2010 fiscal year. The
company previously predicted revenue would increase between 5
percent and 10 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
