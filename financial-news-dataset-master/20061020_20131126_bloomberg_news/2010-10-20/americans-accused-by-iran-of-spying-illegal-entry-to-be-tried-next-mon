The trial of three Americans charged
with illegal entry and espionage in Iran will start Nov. 6 at
the Revolutionary Court in Tehran, their lawyer said.  "Both charges have been denied" by Josh Fattal, Shane Bauer
and Sarah Shourd, the lawyer, Masoud Shafiei, said today in a
telephone interview from Tehran. Shafiei said he has informed
their families of the trial date.  Iran released Shourd on Sept. 14 on bail of $500,000, while
keeping her male companions in custody. She left Iran hours
after being freed. The three were arrested in July 2009 for
illegally crossing into Iran from Iraqi Kurdistan. The U.S.
government has said they mistakenly wandered across the border
during a hiking trip.  U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said yesterday
there is no basis for the charges. “It’s our continuing request
to the Iranian government that, just as they released the young
woman, that they release these two young men,” Clinton said at
a press conference in Washington.  Shafiei said it’s up to Shourd to decide whether to return
to Iran for the trial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
