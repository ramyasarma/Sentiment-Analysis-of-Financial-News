The  U.S. Chamber of Commerce  and its
legal-reform affiliate spent $37 million to lobby Congress and
the executive branch in the last three months, bringing its
total for the year to $81 million.  That’s one-fourth more than the $65 million the group spent
between January and September 2009. For all last year, the
chamber and its Institute for Legal Reform spent a record $144
million on lobbying.  The chamber, the largest U.S. business lobby, failed to
prevent President  Barack Obama  and the Democratic Congress from
overhauling health care and regulating the financial industry.
The group has said it plans to spend $75 million to support
congressional candidates in November’s election. Most of the
money spent by the chamber on political activities from July
through September has gone for advertisements backing Republican
candidates.  The group has led efforts against legislation requiring it
to disclose the corporations and individuals funding its
political activities; the measure was blocked by Senate
Republicans in September.  A top Obama adviser,  David Axelrod , has singled out the
group for criticism over its undisclosed donations, and the
 Democratic National Committee  has run an ad suggesting some of
the money spent on political activities may have come from
overseas. Chamber President  Tom Donohue  has said none of the
money spent on political advertising comes from foreign donors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
