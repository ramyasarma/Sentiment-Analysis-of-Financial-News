Brazilian presidential candidate
 Jose Serra  was hit on his head by a “heavy object” thrown at
him during a rally in Rio de Janeiro, his campaign said in an e-
mailed statement.  Serra’s campaign blamed the incident on supporters of  Dilma Rousseff , his rival in an Oct. 31 runoff. Serra’s campaign said
the candidate became “dizzy” after being struck at a rally in
the working-class suburb of Campo Grande.  A spokeswoman for Serra’s campaign who asked not to be
identified said she did not know what the object was.  The 68-year old Serra cancelled campaigning for the rest of
the day after doctors ordered a CAT scan and recommended rest,
the statement said.  Jose Eduardo Dutra, president of Rousseff’s Workers’ Party,
regretted the incident while refusing to blame the act on party
activists.  “If it was a militant of the PT, then it deserves
censure,” he told reporters in Brasilia. “It doesn’t
contribute to the campaign.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
