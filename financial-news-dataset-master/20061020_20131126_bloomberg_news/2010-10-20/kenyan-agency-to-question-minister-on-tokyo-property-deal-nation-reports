Kenya’s Anti-Corruption Commission
plans to question Foreign Affairs Minister Moses Wetang’ula over
allegations that the government lost 1.1 billion shillings
($13.6 million) acquiring a property in Japan, the  Daily Nation 
reported, citing the commission’s director, Patrick Lumumba.  Kenya’s parliamentary committee on defense and foreign
relations compiled a  report  that also alleges that 84 million
shillings went missing when the government bought a chancery
building in Belgium, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  The report recommends that Wetang’ula and his ministry’s
permanent secretary,  Thuita Mwangi , step aside to allow further
investigations into the deals, the newspaper said.  No one answered the main switchboard today at the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs in Nairobi when Bloomberg News called for
comment. Today is a national holiday in Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
