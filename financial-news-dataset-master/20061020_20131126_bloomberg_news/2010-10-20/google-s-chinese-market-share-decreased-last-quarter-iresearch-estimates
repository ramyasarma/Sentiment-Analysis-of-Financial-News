Google Inc. ’s market share in China
fell to its lowest in almost three years after a dispute with
the government prompted the company to review its operations,
allowing  Baidu Inc.  to gain sales at a faster pace, according to
iResearch Inc.  The U.S. company accounted for 24.6 percent of China’s
Internet search-engine market in the third-quarter, dropping
from 26.8 percent in the previous three months, Nelly Jin, an
analyst at IResearch in Beijing, said by phone today. That’s the
lowest since the fourth-quarter of 2007, she said.  Google had been losing market share to Beijing-based Baidu
since January, when the owner of the world’s most-popular search
engine said it was no longer willing to comply with Chinese
government requirements for web sites to self-censor content.
The U.S. company in March shut its Chinese search service and
redirected local users to its unfiltered Hong Kong site.  Baidu’s market share increased to 72.9 percent in the third
quarter from 71 percent, according to IResearch.  In July, China renewed Google’s Internet license after the
U.S. company changed the arrangement used to re-direct internet
traffic to the Hong Kong site. A month earlier, Google stopped
automatically redirecting users to the Hong Kong site and put in
place a so-called landing page that requires users to opt for
the alternative service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
