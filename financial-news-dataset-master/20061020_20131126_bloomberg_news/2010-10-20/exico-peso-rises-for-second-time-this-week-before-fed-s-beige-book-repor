Mexico’s peso gained the most in
almost two weeks as the dollar dropped after a Federal Reserve
report that showed the U.S. economy is growing at a “moderate
pace,” signaling policy makers may act to spur growth.  The peso rose 1 percent to 12.3963 per dollar at 5 p.m. New
York time, from 12.5245 yesterday. The currency has gained 5.6
percent this year against the dollar. Today’s advance was the
biggest since Oct. 8.  “You listen to the Fed right now and it’s obvious that
they are in a media blitz,” said  Mike Moran , senior currency
strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. Measures by
the Fed to ease monetary policy “can also be positive for
Mexico. That will force flows into Mexico yields.”  The dollar fell 1.7 percent to $1.3964 per euro. The Fed’s
Beige Book business survey said the U.S. economy grew  at a
“modest pace” with little sign of acceleration last month,
fueling speculation policy makers may act next month to ease
monetary policy. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week
that the Fed may buy more assets to help spur growth.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.331 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price fell 0.22 centavo to
134.20 centavos per peso.  Mexico’s retail sales gained 4.4 percent in August from the
same month a year earlier, the national statistics agency said
today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts
had been an increase of 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
