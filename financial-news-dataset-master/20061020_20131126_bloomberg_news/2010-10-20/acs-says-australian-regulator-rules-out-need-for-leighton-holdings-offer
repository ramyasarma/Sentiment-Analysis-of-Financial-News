ACS , the Spanish builder seeking
to gain control of Hochtief AG, said Australia’s market
regulator rejected a request by the German company that would
have forced a buyout offer for  Leighton Holdings Ltd.   Australia’s Securities and Investments Commission notified
the Madrid-based company, whose full name is Actividades de
Construccion & Servicios SA, of its decision to turn down the
proposal, ACS said today in a regulatory filing. Hochtief said
separately that it’s appealing the ruling to the country’s
Takeovers Panel.  The commission decision is a setback to  Hochtief ’s efforts
to block a takeover by ACS. The Essen-based company is trying to
force its Spanish suitor to make a buyout offer for Hochtief’s
Leighton division, Australia’s largest construction company.
Hochtief, which has a market capitalization of 4.3 billion euros
($6 billion),  holds  54.5 percent of the Sydney-based builder.
Leighton is valued at A$11.2 billion ($11 billion).  ACS , which owns just under 30 percent of  Hochtief , is
bidding 2.7 billion euros for full control. The all-share bid is
below market value, enabling ACS to build its stake further
without having to buy the entire company if Hochtief
shareholders reject the offer. The Spanish builder has said it’s
aiming to limit its Hochtief stake to a little over 50 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
