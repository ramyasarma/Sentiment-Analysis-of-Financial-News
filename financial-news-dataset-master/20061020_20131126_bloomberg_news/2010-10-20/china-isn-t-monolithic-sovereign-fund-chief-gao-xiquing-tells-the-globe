The widespread perception that China
Investment Corp., the country’s sovereign wealth fund, is linked
with other Chinese companies in a global quest for natural
resources is wrong, Gao Xiqing, CIC’s president, told the Globe &
Mail.   It’s difficult for the $330 billion fund to team up with
state-owned Chinese strategic investors because, while they want
control of foreign raw-materials companies to guarantee supplies
at low prices, CIC wants high prices, “because we need to make
money,” the newspaper cited Xiqing as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
