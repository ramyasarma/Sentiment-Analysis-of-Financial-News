Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
rose for a second day this week, gaining 192.31, or 0.9 percent,
to 21,425.79 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Milan.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Bulgari SpA  (BUL IM) advanced 3.8 percent to 7.3 euros,
snapping a four-day loss. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added the
world’s third-largest jeweler to its “conviction buy” list,
citing the stocks underperformance relative to luxury-goods
peers over the past 12 month.  Finmeccanica SpA  (FNC IM) gained for a third day, rising 1
percent to 9.27 euros. UniCredit Research reiterated a “buy”
rating on Italy’s biggest defense company, saying that “even if
we are clearly aware of the tough outlook that companies within
the defense industry will have to face, at the same time we also
believe that in some cases, like Finmeccanica, market prices are
probably discounting an overly pessimistic scenario.”  U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday said defense
spending will be cut by 8 percent in inflation-adjusted terms to
help pay down Britain’s record budget deficit.  Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso SpA  (ES IM) jumped 4.5 percent
to 1.74 euros, ending a two-day loss. The publisher of la
Repubblica newspaper said third-quarter net income rose to 7.7
million euros ($10.8 million), from 1.1 million euros a year
earlier, according to a statement distributed through the
Italian exchange.  That compares with the 6.6 million-euro average estimate of
nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Hera SpA  (HER IM) increased 2.1 percent to 1.48 euros, a
second gain this week. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
reiterated a “buy” rating on the utility after the
presentation of the 2010-2014 business plan. Separately,
Cheuvreux trimmed its price estimate to 1.8 euros from 2 euros
while keeping an “outperform” rating.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA  (ISP IM), Italy’s second-biggest bank,
surged 1.7 percent to 2.65 euros. The rate that European banks
say they see each other paying for three-month loans in euros
stayed above 1 percent for the third straight day.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for such loans
climbed to 1.016 percent today from 1.008 percent yesterday, the
European Banking Federation said. That’s the highest level since
July 2009.  UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM), Italy’s biggest lender, rose
1.3 percent to 1.94 euros.  Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA  (UBI
IM), Italy’s fourth-largest bank, advanced 1.6 percent to 7.93
euros.  Italcementi SpA  (IT IM) dropped 1.8 percent to 6.41 euros,
a fourth straight loss. Italy’s biggest cement maker was
downgraded to “underweight” from “buy” at Gruppo Banca
Leonardo and to “hold” from “buy” at Fidentiis Equities SV
SA. Both brokerages cited weakness in market demand in Egypt.  Pirelli & C SpA  (PC IM) advanced 1.8 percent to 6.435
euros, erasing yesterday’s loss. UniCredit SpA increased its
price estimate on the tiremaker to 7 euros from 6.60 euros and
reiterated a “buy” recommendation.  Prysmian SpA  (PRY IM), the world’s second-biggest cable
maker, advanced 1.7 percent to 14.19 euros, the highest in a
week. Copper rose on the Comex after yesterday falling the most
in three months.  Saipem SpA  (SPM IM) increased for a second day this week,
gaining 2.2 percent to 31.83 euros. Europe’s largest oilfield-
services provider won new offshore contracts worth a total of
about 700 million euros, according to a statement distributed by
the Italian exchange today.  The contracts are in Nigeria, Spain and for the North
Stream pipeline in the Baltic sea, the statement said.  Telecom Italia SpA  (TIT IM) rose 1.9 percent to 1.08 euros,
gaining for a third day. Italy’s biggest phone company plans to
“radically upgrade” its mobile broadband network to handle
increased data, Chief Executive Officer Franco Bernabe said.  “The network will be overhauled to adapt to the rise in
data traffic,” Bernabe said at a press conference in Milan
today. The company plans to start offering 21-megabit mobile
broadband service in Milan and Rome in December, and initial
rollout of 42-megabit service is scheduled for the end of 2011,
Bernabe said.  Centrobanca lifted its price estimate on the stock to 1.28
euros from 1.26 euros and kept a “buy” rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
