China’s coal stocks rallied as the
central bank’s interest-rate increase signals the government’s
confidence in the strength of the economy and the resilience of
demand for the fuel, according to Essence Securities Co.  A gauge of energy stocks jumped 4.3 percent, the most among
the 10 industry groups in the CSI 300 Index.  Datong Coal
Industry Co. , China’s third-largest coal company by capacity,
soared by the 10 percent daily limit to 23.82 yuan as of 1:34
p.m. in Shanghai. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., the listed unit of
the fourth-biggest coal miner, rose 5.1 percent to 29.97 yuan.  “The market’s interpretation is that the interest-rate
increase indicates a strong economy, which will increase demand
for coal,” said  Li Dagang , an analyst at Essence Securities Co.
in Shanghai. “And also some institutional investors have been
adding to their allocations for coal stocks so they won’t miss
the boat during this rally.”  The central bank yesterday boosted the benchmark one-year
lending rate to 5.56 percent from 5.31 percent. The deposit rate
was increased to 2.5 percent from 2.25 percent.  -- Zhang Shidong . Editor:  Allen Wan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
