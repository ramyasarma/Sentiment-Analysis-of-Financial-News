Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. may
accelerate plans to improve “efficiency,” including cutting
costs, to help boost profit margins before the possible entry of
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest retailer, into South
Africa, Nick Badminton, chief executive officer of Pick n Pay,
said.  Wal-Mart may introduce “much better purchasing on general
merchandise” and “a different way of working with suppliers,”
which may prompt changes in the way South African retailers do
business, Badminton said in an interview in Johannesburg today.
Competition is already “very tough” in the retail industry, he
said.   Pick n Pay plans to improve its information-technology
systems, cut costs and centralize the distribution of goods as
part of a three-year plan to improve efficiencies at the
company, Badminton said in a presentation to analysts today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
