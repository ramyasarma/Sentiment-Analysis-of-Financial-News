India’s utilities may increase coal
imports by about 16 percent in the year ending March, trader
mjunction Services Ltd. said.  The South Asian nation’s coal imports this financial year
may exceed 80 million metric tons, including 51 million tons of
power-station fuel, according to mjunction, a web-based trader
backed by  Tata Steel Ltd.  and the Steel Authority of India Ltd.  Consumption of coal in India is increasing at 9 to 10
percent a year while production is growing at 7 percent,
creating a shortage of the fuel, mjunction said in a note to
clients dated Oct. 18. India needs to double the pace of growth
in power-station coal supply to help economic expansion, Credit
Suisse Group AG said in July.  India’s thermal coal imports rose by about 16 percent to 44
million tons in the year ended March 2010 from 38 million tons a
year earlier, according to data from the nation’s coal ministry.  The country had 23 coal-fired generators with stockpiles to
last less than a week and 11 plants with less than four days of
inventories as of Oct. 18, according to  data  from the Central
Electricity Authority’s website. That compares with 21 plants
with less than seven days of supplies a week earlier.  Power plants must typically carry coal adequate to last for
15 to 30 days, according to the regulator.  The International Monetary Fund revised India’s 2010
economic growth forecast in July to 9.4 percent from its
prediction of 8.8 percent in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
