Kingsgate Consolidated Ltd. , the
second-largest Australia-traded gold producer by market value,
agreed to buy  Dominion Mining Ltd.  for A$376 million ($367
million) in shares, boosting output by about 60 percent.  The offer values Perth-based Dominion at A$3.63 a share,
Sydney-based  Kingsgate  said today in a statement. That’s 33
percent more than its share price close yesterday.  Global gold mining takeovers are at a record this year with
the bullion price having advanced each year since 2001 as
producers find less metal. Dominion owns the Challenger mine in
South Australia and gold and base metals projects in Western
Australia, while Kingsgate has the Chatree mine in Thailand.  “They are geographically in different locations but this
is providing some diversification which is probably not such a
bad thing,”  Lucinda Chan , division director and head of Asian
business at Macquarie Private Wealth in Sydney, said by phone.
“It’ll give them increased cash flow at the end of the day.”  Kingsgate  yesterday closed down 0.3 percent at A$11.71 and
Dominion closed down 5.2 percent at A$2.73 on the exchange. They
are scheduled to resume trading tomorrow.  “Dominion will provide Kingsgate with immediate access to
additional production and cashflow and also provide geographic
and operational diversification,” Kingsgate Chairman  Ross Smyth-Kirk  said in the joint statement.  Macquarie Group Ltd. is advising Kingsgate and Goldman
Sachs & Partners Australia Pty is advising Dominion.  The deal needs approval from Australian regulators and
Dominion shareholders who are expected to hold a meeting in
January 2011. The combined company will have revenue of A$247
million, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization of A$125 million and no debt, the statement said.  Kingsgate produced 133,628 ounces during the 2010 year
ended June 30, and Dominion 80,570 ounces. Combined output has
the potential to rise to 300,000 ounces, Kingsgate said in a
presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
