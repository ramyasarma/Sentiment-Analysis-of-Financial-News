The euro may erase a one-month rally
against the Swiss franc if it falls below support and forms a
head-and-shoulders pattern, according to Barclays Plc, citing
technical analysis.  A drop in the euro below 1.3260 Swiss francs would
push the euro down toward 1.3165 and 1.3070, Barclays analysts
led by  Jordan Kotick  in New York wrote in a research note to
clients today. The franc has fallen 2.7 percent against the euro
since Sept. 15, a day before the Swiss National Bank cut its
inflation outlook.  “The euro versus the franc bounced off 1.3260 twice over
the past month, and the market is inching closer to this support
level once again,” Kotick wrote. “The market is potentially
carving a topping pattern.”  The 16-nation currency gained today against the franc for
the first time in four days, rising 0.6 percent to 1.3424 at
12:44 p.m. in New York. The euro has gained more than 5 percent
since Sept. 8, when it reached a record low 1.2766.  A head-and-shoulders pattern is formed by three consecutive
peaks on a chart, with the middle being the highest. A breach of
a neckline connecting the base of the three peaks, also a
support level, may signal the reversal of a trend.  The likelihood the euro will trade weaker than 1.3260
francs in one month is 37 percent, implied volatility from
options trading monitored by Bloomberg shows.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Support is a level where
orders to buy may be clustered. The stronger the support, the
more selling is needed to drop below that level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
