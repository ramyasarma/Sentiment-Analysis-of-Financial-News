Newcrest Mining Ltd. , Australia’s
largest gold mining company, said first-quarter gold production
rose 79 percent, boosted by the  acquisition  of Lihir Gold Ltd.  Output was 674,219 ounces in the three months ended Sept.
30, compared with 377,084 ounces a year ago, the Melbourne-based
company said today in a statement today. This compares with a
706,200 ounces forecast from UBS AG.  Newcrest completed the share and cash  takeover  of Lihir in
September this year, creating the world’s fifth-largest gold
producer with mines in Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea
and West Africa. Gold in New York has gained 23 percent this
year, reaching a record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14.  Newcrest shares closed up 0.4 percent at A$39.95 on the
Australian stock exchange.  Full-year gold output is expected to be between 2.85
million ounces and 3.0 million ounces, the company said. Copper
output for the quarter was 17,693 metric tons, down from 21,289
tons a year ago, it said.  A plan to upgrade gold output at the Lihir mine in Papua
New Guinea to 1 million ounces annually will cost $250 million
to $260 million more than the original board approval, Newcrest
said in a presentation. The revised total capital spend will be
$1.23 billion, according to the presentation.  Average forecast output from the mine is 940,000 ounces
during 2011-2015, down from 1 million ounces, before rising to
1.27 million ounces for the next five years after that,
according to the presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Elisabeth Behrmann  in
