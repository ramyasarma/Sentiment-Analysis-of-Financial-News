China’s interest rate increase will
not halt the rally in commodity prices after short-term
corrections, Wanda Futures Co. said.  The government’s unexpected move to raise borrowing costs
signals confidence in the strength of the Chinese economy, Wang
Chen, director of research at Wanda, wrote in an e-mail today.
Wanda Futures is the second-biggest brokerage on China’s Dalian
Commodity Exchange.  “The market has overreacted and the rallies will likely
resume,” Wang wrote. The rate increase may have more impact on
cotton and soybean prices, because China is the biggest buyer of
both crops, Wang wrote. It’s unlikely to affect sugar and
coffee, of which China imports relatively little, he said.  A surge in the value of the  dollar  may also be temporary,
because higher interest rates will likely attract more global
investment into China, boosting liquidity, Wang wrote. Demand
for industrial materials will likely be sustained, supporting
prices after a brief correction, he said.  -- William Bi . Editors: Matthew Oakley, Jarrett Banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
