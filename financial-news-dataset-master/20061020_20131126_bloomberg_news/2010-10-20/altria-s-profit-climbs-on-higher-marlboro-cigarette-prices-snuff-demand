Altria Group Inc. , the largest U.S.
tobacco company, reported third-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates, helped by higher prices for Marlboro
cigarettes and snuff sales.  Net income  rose 28 percent to $1.13 billion, or 54 cents a
share, from $882 million, or 42 cents, a year earlier, the
Richmond, Virginia-based maker of Copenhagen snuff said today in
a statement. Analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg had projected 52
cents, the average of 11 estimates..  Altria’s Philip Morris USA division raised prices by 8
cents a pack on all of its 18 cigarette brands in May after top-
selling Marlboro gained smokers.  Marlboro ’s share increased 0.7
percentage point to 42.6 percent in the quarter while smokeless
tobacco shipments rose 16 percent to 183.9 million cans.  Lower restructuring  costs , including the closing of a
cigarette factory in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, in 2009,
also contributed to profit.  Shipments dropped 2.4 percent to 36.6 billion cigarettes,
as higher prices and smoking bans have crimped demand.
Marlboro’s volume slipped 0.3 percent to 31.8 billion
cigarettes.  Altria raised its full-year  forecast  for per-share earnings
by 2 cents to a range of $1.83 to $1.87 because of tax benefits.
On an adjusted basis, it left unchanged its July forecast of
$1.87 to $1.91, representing growth of 7 percent to 9 percent.
Analysts project $1.89.  Altria advanced 17 cents to $24.92 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The stock has climbed 27
percent this year, after advancing 30 percent in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
