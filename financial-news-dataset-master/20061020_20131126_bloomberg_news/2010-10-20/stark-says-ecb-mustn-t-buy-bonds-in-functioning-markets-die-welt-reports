European Central Bank Executive
Board member  Juergen Stark  said the bank must not buy government
bonds in markets that are functioning, Germany’s Die Welt
newspaper reported, citing an interview.  “We must make sure we don’t intervene with our measures in
functioning markets,” Welt quoted Stark as saying. “Then, the
bond-purchase program could get out of hand and become a quasi-
fiscal policy. That’s why we must keep examining how appropriate
and necessary it still is. And that’s happening. Last week we
didn’t buy any new bonds.”  Stark said while the ECB’s 22-member Governing Council has
“differing opinions,” it also has a “clear direction,” Welt
reported.  “We are in a process of allowing our temporary support
measures to slowly expire,” Stark said, according to the
newspaper. “Beyond that, there remains the transition back to
variable rates in the refinancing operations for banks and the
termination of the bond program. We are constantly examining
whether the conditions under which we introduced these measures
still prevail. The situation on financial markets has calmed.”  Stark also said too-loose monetary policy can have negative
effects, including reducing the incentive for governments to
implement fiscal consolidation, Welt said. He said the ECB sees
neither inflation nor deflation risks at present.  To contact the reporter on this story:
