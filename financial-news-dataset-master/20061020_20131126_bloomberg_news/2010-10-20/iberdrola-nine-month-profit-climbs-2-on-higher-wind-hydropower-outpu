Iberdrola SA , the world’s largest
owner of wind energy parks, increased nine-month profit 2
percent as it generated more electricity with hydropower plants
and wind turbines.  Net income rose to 2.07 billion euros ($2.85 billion) from
2.03 billion euros a year earlier, the Bilbao, Spain-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. That exceeded the
1.984 billion-euro  mean estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts. Earnings growth will continue, Chief Executive  Jose Ignacio Sanchez Galan  said.  “I hope and trust that results at the end of the year will
maintain or improve the line we have had in these nine months,”
 Galan  said today on a conference call.  Spain’s largest utility generates more than half its power
 outside the country  after expanding abroad to cut reliance on
the domestic market, where demand fell in 2009 and regulators
let it recoup only a portion of costs. Iberdrola is trying to
sell more assets after  buying  U.S. utility Energy East Corp. in
2008 and  Scottish Power Ltd.  in 2007.  This month, the utility increased its holding in Spanish
wind-turbine manufacturer  Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA .  “We think the stock is cheap,” Galan said about Gamesa on
a conference call today. “We have bought it and we will very
probably continue buying. We have no interest in exceeding the
limit of 30” percent.  Gamesa Holdings  Iberdrola on Oct. 18 said it increased its stake in Gamesa
to 15.057 percent after buying an additional 0.08 percent of the
Zamudio, northern Spain-based company. On Oct. 14 and 15 it had
announced purchases of additional Gamesa stakes of 0.22 percent
and 0.18 percent respectively.  “Our engineers say the products they are developing are
very good and will have a very reasonable cost, and operating
costs that are even inferior to the ones we have had until
now,” Galan said. “Very probably in the next few months we may
make the first orders of the 4.5-megawatt machines to be
delivered in 2012 and operating in 2013.”  Gamesa shares climbed 5.6 percent to 4.961 euros in Madrid.
 Iberdrola  slipped 0.1 percent to 5.855 euros, bringing the
stock’s decline for the year to 12 percent and valuing the
utility at 31.5 billion euros.  Hydropower output more than doubled in the first nine
months of the year as electricity use in Spain rose, rebounding
after the recession eroded demand in 2009. The average spot
price in Spain in the first nine months of the year fell to
35.69 euros a megawatt-hour from 39.12 euros a year earlier.  Ebitda Growth  The Spanish company has targeted average  annual growth  of 5
percent to 9 percent in earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization from 2009 through 2012. Nine-month
Ebitda rose 12 percent to 5.56 billion euros.  Iberdrola said Feb. 24 that net investment from 2010
through 2012 may total 16 billion euros as it spends more on
renewable-energy projects and networks. Gross investment may
climb to 18 billion euros, while asset sales may raise as much
as 2.5 billion euros through 2012. Almost two-thirds of the
planned gross investment was earmarked for the U.S. and the U.K.  The utility said in February it had a “flexible approach
to investment” and committed to spend only 9.6 billion euros of
the estimated 16 billion-euro net investment through 2012. It
targets annual cost savings of 300 million euros by 2012.  Net Debt  Iberdrola ended 2009 with adjusted  net debt  of 28.5 billion
euros and that increased to 30.1 billion euros at the end of
September. This year, Iberdrola sold a 2.7 percent stake in
Portuguese utility  EDP-Energias de Portugal SA , following the
sale of its 15.7 percent holding in  Petroceltic International
Plc  in January.  UIL Holdings Corp., a Connecticut power supplier, on May 25
said it agreed to buy three New England utilities from Iberdrola
for about $885 million. Iberdrola has said it aims to use the
proceeds to help finance a $1.4 billion power line linking Maine
and Canada.  Iberdrola’s installed capacity totals 44,455 megawatts, of
which natural gas-fired plants account for 30 percent, renewable
energy 27 percent, hydropower 22 percent, and nuclear plants 7.5
percent.  Iberdrola Renovables SA , the utility’s renewable-energy
unit, aims to increase its capacity to 12,500 megawatts by the
end of this year. The Renovables unit on Oct. 18 said nine-month
profit rose 7.1 percent as it generated more power in the U.S.
market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
