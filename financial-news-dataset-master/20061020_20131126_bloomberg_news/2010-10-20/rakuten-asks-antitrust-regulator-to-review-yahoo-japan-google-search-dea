Rakuten Inc. , the Japanese Internet
shopping site operator, asked Japan’s Fair Trade Commission to
review an Internet-search partnership between  Yahoo! Japan Corp. 
and  Google Inc. , saying the deal may deter competition.  “The partnership deserves careful consideration because
there is a real possibility that the industry’s overall growth
could be adversely affected,” said Hirotoshi Kato, a spokesman
at Tokyo-based Rakuten.  Yahoo Japan, operator of the nation’s most-visited Web
portal, said in July it will use Google’s search and advertising
technology to replace its current system as early as this year.
The two companies, Japan’s largest search-engine operators,
signed a two-year contract with an option to renew.  The regulator will examine the request, Takahide Matsuyama,
secretary-general of the commission, said at a briefing in Tokyo
today.  Yahoo Japan  fell 3 percent to close at 28,610 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, paring its gain to 2.8 percent this year.
 Rakuten  declined 0.3 percent to 61,000 yen on the Jasdaq
exchange, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 1.7
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Yoshinori Eki  in Tokyo
