The Bank of England’s Monetary
Policy Committee should seriously consider following Adam
Posen’s call to expand its 200 billion-pound ($315 billion)
stimulus of so-called quantitative easing, the British Chambers
of Commerce said.  “The MPC minutes showed that for the first time, one
member has voted to increase the quantitative easing programme
by a further 50 billion pounds to 250 billion pounds -- a move
that the BCC has been calling for over recent months,” BCC
Chief Economist David Kern said in an e-mailed statement today
in London. “We believe that such a move is necessary given the
expected impact on the economy of the forthcoming VAT increase
and spending cuts.”  “While we support the painful fiscal measures that the
government is preparing to implement, it is important to reduce
the risk of a downturn, and increasing the QE program can play
an important role in sustaining demand in the economy,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
