State Bank of India  plans to
complete its first retail bond sale on Oct. 23, two days earlier
than scheduled, according to an advertisement in the Financial
Express newspaper today.  The bank received bids for 19 times the bonds offered to
investors, or 90 billion rupees ($2 billion), on the first day,
Chief Financial Officer S.S. Ranjan said by telephone today.  “We would have closed even earlier, but we needed to give
investors three days notice,” Ranjan said in Mumbai.  The sale began on Oct. 18.  State Bank  is selling bonds for
5 billion rupees, with an option to retain oversubscription up
to another 5 billion rupees, according to a bank statement.  The Lower Tier II bonds will be issued in two series, one
with a maturity of 10 years and coupon of 9.25 percent, and the
other due in 15 years and paying 9.50 percent, according to a
presentation made to reporters in Mumbai on Oct. 15.  Citigroup ,  Kotak Mahindra Capital Co.  and SBI Capital
Markets Ltd. are managing the transaction.  Indian companies have raised $6 billion in international
bond sales this year, more than three times the amount raised in
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
