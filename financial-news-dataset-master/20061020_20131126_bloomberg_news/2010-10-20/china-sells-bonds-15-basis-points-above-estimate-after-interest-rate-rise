China’s finance ministry sold 28
billion yuan ($4.2 billion) in five-year bonds at an average
yield of 2.91 percent, according to traders at Citic Securities
Co. and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd.  That was 15 basis points higher than the 2.76 percent
median estimate of 15 financial companies surveyed by Bloomberg
yesterday before China announced an increase in the nation’s
benchmark lending and deposit rates that are effective today. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The highest winning-bid yield at the sale was 2.96 percent,
said the traders at the primary dealers required to bid at the
government auctions. The issuance drew bids 1.53 times the
amount on offer, according to the traders.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
