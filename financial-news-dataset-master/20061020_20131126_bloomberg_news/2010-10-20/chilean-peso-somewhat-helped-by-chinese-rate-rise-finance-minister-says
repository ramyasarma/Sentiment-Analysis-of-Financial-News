China’s decision to raise interest
rates was “somewhat” helpful for Chile’s currency, Latin
America’s best performer in the last three months, Finance
Minister  Felipe Larrain  said.  Larrain spoke in an interview today during a regional tour
to promote the government’s planned budget. He said earlier
today that the government is concerned by the peso’s strength
and probably will unveil foreign exchange measures this week.  The People’s Bank of China unexpectedly increased its
benchmark lending and deposit rates for the first time since
2007, lifting the rates by 25 basis points each. China is the
biggest customer for Chile’s main export, copper.  “That helped somewhat,” Larrain said. “The Chinese are
using an indirect methodology. I would have preferred a direct
form of appreciating the yuan. Effectively it brought with it a
reduction in global commodity prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
