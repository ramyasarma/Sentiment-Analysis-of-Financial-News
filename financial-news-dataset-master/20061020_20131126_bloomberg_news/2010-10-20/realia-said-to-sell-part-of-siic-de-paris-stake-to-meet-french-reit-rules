Realia Business SA  plans to sell
part of its stake in its French real estate investment trust to
a company controlled by  Inmobiliaria Colonial SA  to comply with
ownership rules, two people with knowledge of the deal said.  Societe Fonciere Lyonnaise SA , a property company 53
percent-owned by Barcelona-based Colonial, will swap two Paris
buildings in return for shares of the REIT, SIIC de Paris SA,
one of the people said. Both asked not to be named before an
official announcement, which they said will be made this week.  The transaction will reduce Realia’s stake in the REIT to
less than 60 percent, one of the people said. That will enable
the Madrid-based company to comply with French REIT regulations
and avoid the risk of losing tax benefits.  Morgan Stanley, Commerz Real AG and the Dassault family
have all cut their stakes in French REITs for the same reason.  Alvaro Hernandez, a spokesman for Realia, and Colonial
spokesman Xavier Ribo declined to comment.  Trading in Societe Fonciere Lyonnaise and SIIC de Paris
shares was suspended today. SIIC has a market value of 529
million euros ($737 million), based on the latest share price in
Paris.  Realia owns 84.3 percent of SIIC de Paris. The company must
cut the stake to less than 60 percent by the end of the year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
