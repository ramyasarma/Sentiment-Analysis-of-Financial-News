A one-month rally in Japanese
government bond futures may stall, capped by resistance formed
by a five-day moving average, Mizuho Securities Co. said, citing
trading patterns.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery rose from
141.23 on Sept. 10 to 144.15 on Oct. 6, supported by the five-
day average, according to  Tetsuya Miura , chief market analyst at
the unit of Japan’s second-largest banking group. The contracts
have stayed below the average since Oct. 13 and declined to as
low as 143.69 yesterday. The five-day line was at 143.85
yesterday.  “The five-day moving average will serve as a line of
resistance in the near term,” Miura said. “The futures have
entered range-bound trading at the 143 level.”  The 14-day relative strength index for the futures reached
73.60 on Oct. 6, the day after the Bank of Japan announced
additional easing steps. Readings above 70 indicate an asset’s
price is poised to reverse course. The index has remained below
the 70 level since the following day, signaling the contracts
are correcting from overbought conditions, Miura said.  The futures are being supported by the 25-day moving
average, which was at 143.07 yesterday, and will likely stay
between the five- and 25-day lines at the 143 yen level in the
near term, Miura said. If the futures fall below 143, they may
reach the mid-142 level, where the 13-week moving average is, he
said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
