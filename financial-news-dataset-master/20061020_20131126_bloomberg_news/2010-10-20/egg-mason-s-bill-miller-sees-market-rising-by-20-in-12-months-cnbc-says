Bill Miller, chairman and chief
investment officer of Legg Mason Capital Management, said he is
“optimistic” of the financial markets outlook and said he’d be
surprised if the market wasn’t up 20 percent over the next 12
months.  Low interest rates may lead to higher asset prices, Miller
said in an interview with financial news network CNBC.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
