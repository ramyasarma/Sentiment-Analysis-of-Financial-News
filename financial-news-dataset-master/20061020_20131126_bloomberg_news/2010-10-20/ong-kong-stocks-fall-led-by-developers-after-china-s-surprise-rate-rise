Hong Kong  stocks  fell after China
unexpectedly increased its lending and deposit rates, raising
concern a slowdown in the world’s fastest-growing major economy
may derail the global recovery.  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. , the biggest real-estate
company in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, slumped 5.3
percent.  China Resources Land Ltd. , a state-controlled developer,
tumbled 4.1 percent.  PetroChina Co. , the country’s biggest oil
company, fell 2.5 percent after crude prices slid on concern
demand from China, the world’s biggest energy-using country, may
slow.  The  Hang Seng Index  declined 0.9 percent to 23,556.50 at
the close, with more than nine stocks declining for every two
that advanced on the 45-member gauge. The measure had advanced
6.3 percent this month through yesterday. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese companies
slid 0.9 percent to 13,448.83.  “It’s a good excuse for the market to have a correction,”
said  Alex Au , managing director of Richland Capital Management
Ltd. in Hong Kong, which oversees $300 million of assets. “But
if the market corrects to a certain level, there will be a lot
of money on the sideline to put on more risk.”  China-based developers and banks fell.  Guangzhou R&F
Properties  sank 5.3 percent to HK$11.52. China Resources Land
tumbled 4.1 percent to HK$16.  China Overseas Land & Investment
Ltd. , controlled by the nation’s construction ministry, dropped
3 percent to HK$16.56.  Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. , which
receives all its sales from China, dropped 5.8 percent to
HK$12.90.  Curbing Asset Inflation  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s No.
1 lender, fell 1.1 percent to HK$6.26.  Bank of China Ltd. , the
country’s No. 3 lender, slid 2 percent to HK$4.51.  China’s central bank yesterday raised borrowing costs for
the first time since 2007, as policy makers try to curb lending
and prevent an asset-price bubble. China lifted the benchmark
one-year lending rate to 5.56 percent from 5.31 percent. The
deposit rate was increased to 2.5 percent from 2.25 percent.  Thirteen of the 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
last month forecast that lending rates would stay unchanged this
year. Central bank Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  on Oct. 8 signaled
that bank reserve requirements and bill sales were sufficient
tools to control inflation.  The Hang Seng Index posted seven  weekly gains  in a row
until Oct. 15, the longest weekly winning streak since the
period ended Nov. 2, 2007, as economic reports and corporate
earnings boosted confidence in a global economic recovery.
Stocks in the gauge trade at an average 15 times estimated
 earnings , compared with about 17.2 times at the start of the
year.  Commodity producers fell on concern China’s higher
benchmark interest rates will crimp demand.  Oil, Copper  PetroChina slid 2.5 percent to HK$9.79.  Cnooc Ltd. , the
nation’s largest offshore oil producer, dropped 2.6 percent to
HK$15.92.  Crude oil for November delivery sank 4.3 percent to settle
at $79.49 a barrel yesterday in New York, the steepest drop
since Feb. 4, while the  London Metal Exchange Index  of six
metals including aluminum and copper lost 2.1 percent.  Jiangxi Copper Co. , China’s No. 1 producer of the metal,
tumbled 3.1 percent to HK$22.20. Zijin Mining Group Co., China’s
largest gold producer, decreased 2.4 percent to HK$7.45, while
Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest producer of
the lightweight metal, slid 3.3 percent to HK$7.90. Measures of
energy and materials companies had the two steepest drops among
the  Hang Seng Composite Index ’s 11 industry groups.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index declined 1.1 percent to
23,554.  To contact the reporter on this story:
