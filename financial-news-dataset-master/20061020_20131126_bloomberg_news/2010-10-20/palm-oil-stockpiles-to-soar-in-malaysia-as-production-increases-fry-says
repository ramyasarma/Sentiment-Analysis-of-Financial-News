Global palm oil output will increase
strongly, driving an increase in stockpiles in  Malaysia,  the
second-largest producer after Indonesia, according to  James Fry ,
managing director of LMC International.  The increase will widen the discount that palm oil trades
at compared with soybean oil, Fry said in a prepared speech at
an oils and fats conference in Kuala Lumpur today. Palm oil at
2,500 ringgit ($799) a metric ton “best reflects” the demand
and supply of the tropical oil used in foods and fuel, Fry said.  Palm oil output in Malaysia may climb 3.4 percent to 18.4
million tons next year, according to a government forecast on
Oct. 15. Indonesia may produce 19 million to 20 million tons,
according to the country’s palm oil association. The two
represent about 90 percent of output worldwide.  Stockpiles in Malaysia rose in September to 1.71 million
tons, the highest level in seven months, according to that
country’s palm oil board on Oct. 11. Palm oil on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange closed at 2,919 ringgit yesterday after
rising 29 percent from the year’s low of 2,270 ringgit on July 7.  Palm oil’s  discount  to soybean oil was $106.40 a ton,
according to Bloomberg data.  Sabri Ahmad , managing director of Felda Group Holdings Bhd.,
said palm oil demand from China and India, the two biggest users,
is “very good.”  A price of 2,700 ringgit better reflects the
supply-demand situation than Fry’s forecast, he said.  Production in Malaysia this year may total 17.6 million
tons, little changed from last year’s 17.56 million tons, said
Ahmad, the former chairman of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board who
spoke in an interview at the same conference.  Felda runs 880,000 hectares (2.2 million acres) of
plantations in Malaysia, primarily oil palms and rubber trees,
according to its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
