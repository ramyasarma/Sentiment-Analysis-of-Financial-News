Canadian stocks  rose as metal
producers rebounded on a weaker U.S. dollar as investors
speculated the U.S. Federal Reserve will take further action to
stimulate the economy.  Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, gained 3.2 percent as the U.S. dollar fell against 15

with some potential quantitative easing,” said  Youssef Zohny ,

investors quite happy to buy a lot of the dips on the materials
and gold names.”  The S&P/TSX has gained five straight weeks through last

Dominion Bank, respectively, raised their price estimates on the
shares in notes dated yesterday.  Encana retreated 3.4 percent to C$29.13 after cutting its
