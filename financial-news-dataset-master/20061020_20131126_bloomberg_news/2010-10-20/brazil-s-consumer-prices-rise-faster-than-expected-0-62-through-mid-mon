Brazil’s  inflation  rate through mid-
October doubled from the previous month, led by a 1.7 percent
jump in food prices.  Consumer prices as measured by the benchmark IPCA-15 index
rose 0.62 percent, the fastest pace since May, the government’s
 statistics agency  said today. The figure was higher than market
expectations for prices to rise 0.55 percent, according to the
median forecast of 42 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The IPCA-
15 rose 5.03 percent from a year ago.  The central bank forecasts that inflation will slow to 4.6
percent next year if the its benchmark Selic remains at 10.75
percent, according to a report published Sept. 30. Policy makers
are expected leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 10.75 percent
at today’s policy meeting, the second-last of the year,
according to all 51 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  A rise in wholesale prices of agricultural products such as
corn and beans means that further inflationary pressure from
food is likely, Morgan Stanley said in a report distributed Oct.
18. Meat prices rose 4.93 percent through mid-October and
chicken 5.69 percent, the statistics agency said today.  The real strengthened 0.5 percent to 1.6748 per U.S. dollar
at 7:00 a.m. New York time. The currency has appreciated 3.8
percent since the start of September, the second best
performance after the Chilean peso of major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The yield on the contract due January 2012, the most traded
on the Sao Paulo BM&F futures exchange, was unchanged at 11.32
percent.  IGP-M Index  Inflation as measured by the IGP-M, Brazil’s broadest price
index, slowed to 0.89 percent in the Sept.21-Oct.10 from 1.03
percent in the same period a month earlier, the Getulio Vargas
Foundation said today. The IGP-M index is 60 percent weighted in
wholesale prices and also measures consumer and construction
costs.  Economists covering the Brazilian economy raised their 2010
inflation forecast for a fifth straight week in a central bank
survey published Oct. 18. Consumer price inflation will quicken
to 5.2 percent in 2010, compared with a week-earlier forecast of
5.15 percent, according to the median forecast of about 100
economists surveyed.  Stronger Currency  The real’s performance led Finance Minister  Guido Mantega 
to raise taxes on foreign capital flows for the second time this
month. Mantega on Oct. 18 raised to 6 percent, from 4 percent,
the so-called IOF tax on foreigners’ purchase of fixed-income
assets.  A stronger Brazilian real is helping to mitigate
inflationary pressure from record low  unemployment , said  Alfredo Coutino , director of Latin America at Moody’s Analytics.  “The currency revaluation is going to be beneficial for
Brazilian inflation,” Coutino said in a telephone interview.
“Salaries are gaining purchasing power in dollar terms.”  The central bank held its benchmark rate at 10.75 percent
at its Aug. 31-Sept. 1 meeting, after raising it 200 basis
points this year from a record low 8.75 percent.  The bank estimates that Brazil’s economy will expand 7.3
percent this year.  Retail sales  rose at a faster-than-expected 2
percent in August from a month earlier, fueled by credit growth
and record low unemployment.  The country’s unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent in
August. At the same time,  bank lending  expanded in August at its
fastest pace since July 2009, according to central bank figures.  The stock of outstanding credit increased 2.2 percent from
the previous month, led by an increase in mortgage lending,
according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
