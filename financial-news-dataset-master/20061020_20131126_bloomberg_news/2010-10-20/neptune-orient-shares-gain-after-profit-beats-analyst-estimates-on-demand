Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. , owner of
Asia’s second-largest container company by capacity, rose the
most in more than three months after reporting a better-than-
expected profit on higher freight rates and increased trade.  Neptune Orient  rose 3.4 percent, the biggest advance since
July 8, to close at S$2.13 in Singapore. The stock was the
second- best performer  on the Straits Times Index today.  The Singapore-based shipping line’s container volume
increased 12 percent from a year earlier in the third quarter as
rising consumer confidence in the U.S. and Europe stokes demand
for Asian-made goods, Neptune Orient reported yesterday after
the market closed. The company and larger rival Evergreen Group
have both ordered vessels this year as lines rebound from
industrywide losses.  “Global trade is likely to remain firm next year and
Neptune Orient will benefit from higher volumes and rates,”
 Alfred Low , an analyst at Philip Securities in Singapore, wrote
in a note to investors today, raising his recommendation on the
stock to “buy” from “hold.”  Neptune Orient posted a net income of $282.3 million in the
three months ended Sept. 17, compared with a $138.9 million loss
a year earlier. That beat the $157 million average of three
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales jumped 55 percent
to $2.4 billion.  The company reiterated that it expects to make a full-year
profit. It reported the first  annual loss  in seven years in 2009
as the global recession and overcapacity in the global fleet
drove freight rates down.  To contact the reporter on this story:
