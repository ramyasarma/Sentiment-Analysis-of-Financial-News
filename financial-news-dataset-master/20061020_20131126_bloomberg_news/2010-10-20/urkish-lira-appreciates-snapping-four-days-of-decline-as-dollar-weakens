The Turkish lira strengthened,
snapping a four-day decline, after the dollar weakened against
the euro on speculation that the Federal Reserve will signal
further credit-easing measures to support economic growth.  The lira appreciated 0.7 percent to 1.4286 per dollar at
11:09 a.m. in Istanbul. The dollar depreciated to $1.3815 per
euro, from $1.3727 in New York yesterday.  The U.S. currency weakened against 14 of its 16 major
counterparts before the Fed releases its Beige Book regional
business survey today, which may show a slowing recovery in the
world’s largest economy.  “The lira’s move is in line with euro-dollar, as the
dollar declines the lira rises,” said  Levent Guven , head of
currency trading at Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS in Istanbul. “The
lira is trading better compared to other emerging currencies.”  Turkey’s currency fell yesterday after China raised its key
interest rate and the U.S. said it won’t be party to any
currency war. The main ISE National 100  Index  slid for a second
day, dropping 0.6 percent to 69,441.19. Benchmark two-year lira
 bonds  rose, with yields declining three basis points to 7.68
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
