Cotton futures climbed by the
exchange limit in New York as dwindling stockpiles renewed
speculation that supplies will fall short of climbing demand.
Orange-juice prices dropped.  As of yesterday, cotton  inventories  monitored by ICE
Futures U.S. plunged to 11,446 bales from this year’s high of
1.08 million on June 2. Global consumption will increase 2.6
percent in the year that began Aug. 1 from a year earlier, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture has said. A bale weighs 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms.  “We’re still in very much a bull market,” said  Keith Brown , the president of Keith Brown & Co., a brokerage in
Moultrie, Georgia. “We’re thinking about a smaller crop. We’re
seeing demand remain robust.”  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 4 cents, the most
allowed by ICE, or 3.6 percent, to settle at $1.1426 a pound at
2:30 p.m. in New York. On Oct 15, the price reached $1.198, the
highest level since the fiber starting trading 140 years ago.  This year, futures have jumped 51 percent, the most among
19 raw materials in the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  Cotton probably will outperform other raw materials because
of tight supplies,  Dwight Anderson , a commodity hedge-fund
manager who oversees $1.8 billion, said yesterday at the Global
Financial Leadership Conference hosted by CME Group Inc. in
Naples, Florida.  Anderson, the founder of New York-based Ospraie Management
LLC, said that platinum-group metals and copper will also gain
more than other commodities.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery fell 2.25 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to close at $1.484 a pound in New York. The
price has jumped 15 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
