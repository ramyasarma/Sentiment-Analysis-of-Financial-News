Independencia SA, the Brazilian
meatpacker that halted output this month and missed a bond
payment in September, called a meeting with creditors as it
seeks to change its plan to restructure debt. The company’s 2015
bonds fell the most in almost three weeks.  Independencia, whose creditors include Citibank Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase & Co., called the meeting for Nov. 8 at 10 a.m.
in Sao Paulo, according to a one-page document filed with a
court in Cajamar, Brazil. The meatpacker will have a second
meeting on Nov. 22 if creditors holding more than 50 percent of
total debt aren’t present at the first gathering.  The company, which filed for bankruptcy protection in
February 2009, said Oct. 13 it halted production and cut senior
management jobs after failing to generate enough cash to cover
costs. On Sept. 30, Independencia missed a $12 million interest
payment on $165 million of its 15 percent bonds due in 2015.  “Creditors may be willing to give a second chance to
Independencia,” Barclays Plc analyst  Juan Cruz  said today in a
telephone interview from New York. “It really depends on the
kind of deal they are offering.”  Independencia 2015 bonds fell 3.52 cents to 54.725 cents on
the dollar at 2:50 pm New York time, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. It’s the biggest drop since Sept 30.  Carlos Henrique Brocchi , a director for Independencia,
didn’t return a call and an e-mail from Bloomberg News seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
