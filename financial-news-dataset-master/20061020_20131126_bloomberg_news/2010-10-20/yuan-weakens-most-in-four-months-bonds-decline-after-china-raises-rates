The yuan fell the most in four
months on speculation China’s first interest-rate increase since
2007 alleviates the need for currency gains to combat inflation.  The People’s Bank of China set the daily reference rate 0.3
percent weaker at 6.6754 per dollar, the biggest decline since
August, reflecting a rally in the greenback. Finance ministers
from the Group of 20 nations will meet in Gyeongju, South Korea,
this week before the countries’ leaders meet for talks next
month in Seoul. China’s  benchmark  five-year bonds fell.  The reference rate was fixed weaker “given what happened
to the dollar overnight,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. “Even though
they may get trouble in G-20, it’s possible they may want to
soften the appreciation’s blow to exporters.”  The yuan slid 0.21 percent to 6.6585 as of 9:54 a.m. in
Shanghai, from 6.6447 yesterday, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. That was the biggest drop since June 22.
It has risen 2.5 percent since a two-year peg against the dollar
was scrapped on June 19.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.24 percent to
6.4510 per dollar in Hong Kong, reflecting bets the currency
will strengthen 3.2 percent in one year’s time. The Dollar  Index 
traded on ICE futures in New York, which tracks the greenback
against those of six trading partners, jumped 1.7 percent
yesterday, the most in two months.  Rate Increases  The central bank yesterday raised its benchmark one-year
lending rate to 5.56 percent from 5.31 percent, and the deposit
rate to 2.5 percent from 2.25 percent.  “The rate hikes show China won’t just rely on raising the
yuan to damp inflation,” said  Gerrard Katz , the Hong-Kong based
head of foreign-exchange trading at Standard Chartered Plc.
“The yuan fixing might move up very slowly and it will start
moving faster again just before the G-20.”  A government report tomorrow will show consumer prices rose
3.6 percent from a year earlier in September, the most in nearly
two years, according to the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the 2.58 percent note due August 2015 jumped
14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 2.90 percent,
according to the National Interbank Funding Center. That’s the
biggest increase since June 18, the day before the People’s Bank
of China signaled it would end a two-year currency peg and allow
the yuan to trade more freely.  “The rate increase, especially the timing, caught the bond
market by surprise,” said  Chen Jianbo , a bond analyst at BOC
International (China) Ltd. in Beijing. “The probability for
another hike this year is low now. The central bank will
strengthen sterilization through open-market operations.”  The three-year note issued by the central bank jumped 19
basis points to 2.9 percent in Shanghai, the highest since it
was issued August 12, Interbank Funding Center data show. The
monetary authority will sell three-month bills tomorrow.  -- Judy Chen ,  Belinda Cao ,  Andrea Wong . Editors:  James Regan ,
