China National Offshore Oil Corp. ,
the country’s third-biggest oil company, has started building
its fourth liquefied natural gas terminal to meet rising demand.  The terminal, in southern China’s Zhuhai city, will receive
3.5 million metric tons of LNG a year after its startup in 2013,
China National Offshore, parent of Hong Kong-listed Cnooc Ltd.,
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Chinese oil companies are building LNG import terminals on
the eastern coast as the country increases consumption of the
cleaner-burning fuel. The terminal, the second in Guangdong
province, requires investment of 11.3 billion yuan ($1.7
billion),  China Securities Journal  reported today, citing CNOOC
Oil & Gas Group, a unit of China National Offshore.  The terminal’s annual receiving capacity will be expanded
to 7 million tons in the second phase, China National Offshore
said. “The company will start the second-phase development
based on market needs,” according to the statement.  The annual receiving capacity will be expanded to 12
million tons eventually, according to the China Securities
report.  CNOOC Oil & Gas owns 30 percent of the terminal, the
newspaper said. Guangdong Yudean Group, which supplies most of
the electricity in the southern province, holds a 25 percent
stake.  -- Winnie Zhu . Editors:  Ryan Woo ,  Alexander Kwiatkowski .  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
