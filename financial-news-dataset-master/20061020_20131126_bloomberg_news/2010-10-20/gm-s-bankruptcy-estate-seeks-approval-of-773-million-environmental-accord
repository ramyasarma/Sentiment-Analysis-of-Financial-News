General Motors Corp. ’s bankruptcy
estate seeks public and court approval of a settlement that sets
aside $773 million to resolve environmental liabilities.  The mix of cash and assets, to be put into trusts, will
clean up and administer 89 properties, 59 of which are known to
be contaminated, according to a statement by Gary Grinder,
acting deputy U.S. attorney general. A 30-day period to gather
public comment will precede a request for bankruptcy court
approval.  “More than half of the cleanup funds to be paid to the
environmental response trust will be provided for the
environmental remediation of sites in New York and Michigan,”
Grinder said in the statement.  The resolution of environmental issues paves the way for
the old GM estate to end bankruptcy, after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
 Robert Gerber  in New York in May gave the company a four-month
extension of its time in Chapter 11 to resolve environmental
liabilities.  The case is In re Motors Liquidation Co., 09-50026, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
