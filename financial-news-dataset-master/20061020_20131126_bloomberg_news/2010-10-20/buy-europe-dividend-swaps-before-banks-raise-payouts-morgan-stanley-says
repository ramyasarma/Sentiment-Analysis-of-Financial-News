Investors should buy European
dividend futures because the contracts are cheap and financial
companies will increase payments over the next year, according
to Morgan Stanley.  Contracts on the  Euro Stoxx 50 Index  that allow investors
to receive future dividends show payouts are likely to decline
through 2014, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. The market is
too pessimistic, said Morgan Stanley’s  Praveen Singh , who
predicts the contracts will rally as European banks and
insurance companies boost dividends.  “What we’re seeing in the dividend market is that price
levels are really depressed and they are not pricing in any
growth,” said Singh, an equity derivatives strategist for the
New York-based bank. Dividends “are implying an approximately
20 percent decline in earnings for 2011,” he said.  Concern that European lenders will cut payouts to comply
with new capital requirements is contributing to the low cost of
the futures, Singh said. He said the prices are also depressed
because supply of dividend futures and swaps is often greater
than demand as structured-product desks sell the contracts as a
way to hedge against long-dividend risk.  Earnings Estimates  Analysts’ forecasts show companies in the Euro Stoxx 50
will increase earnings by  13 percent  on average next year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The median economist projection
indicates gross domestic product for the 16 countries using the
euro will rise an average of 1.4 percent in 2011 and 1.7 percent
in 2012.  The  contract  for dividends paid in 2011 from companies in
the Euro Stoxx 50 has rallied 24 percent to 114 since June 8.
That corresponds to analysts’ estimates showing the index may
pay a total of 122.71 euros per share, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures for 2012 are up 30 percent to
109.8 since July 1, while the forecasts from company analysts
indicate dividends of 135.89 euros per share for the year.  The Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 0.5 percent to 2,851.52 as of
12 p.m. New York time. The gauge, which is down 3.8 percent in
2010, had a dividend yield of 3.8 percent as of Oct. 11,
according to Bloomberg data.  Contracts for future dividends from companies in the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index , which are not publicly listed and
trade over the counter, are also inexpensive, Singh said. He’s
bullish on the swaps for 2012 and 2013.  To contact the reporter for this story:
