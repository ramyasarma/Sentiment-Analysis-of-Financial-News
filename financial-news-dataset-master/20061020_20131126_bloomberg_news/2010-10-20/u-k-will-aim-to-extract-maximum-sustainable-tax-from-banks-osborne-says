Chancellor of the Exchequer George
Osborne said the government will aim to extract the maximum
amount of tax it can from banks without driving them out of the
U.K.  “We neither want to let banks off making their fair
contribution, nor do we want to drive them abroad,” he said in
Parliament today in London. “Our aim will be to extract the
maximum sustainable tax revenues from financial services. We
will assess what those maximum revenues could be -– not just in
one year, but over a period of years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
