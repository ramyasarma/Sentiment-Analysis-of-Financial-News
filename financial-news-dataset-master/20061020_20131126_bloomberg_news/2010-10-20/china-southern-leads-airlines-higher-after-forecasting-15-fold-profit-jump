China Southern Airlines Co. , the
nation’s biggest carrier, led airlines higher in Shanghai
trading after saying nine-month profit probably rose more than
15-fold.  The  airline  rose 1.8 percent to 11.45 yuan at the close of
trading, after earlier gaining as much as 8.1 percent. China
Eastern Airlines Corp. climbed 2.2 percent to 8.97 yuan.  Air
China Ltd.  jumped 1.8 percent to 15.79 yuan.  China Southern expects to report the profit increase after
carrying more passengers amid the global economic revival and
benefiting from a stronger yuan. The benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index swung between gains and losses after China
raised interest rates for the first time since 2007.  Guangzhou-based China Southern boosted passenger traffic,
or the distance it carried paying travelers, 22 percent in the
first nine months of the year. A stronger yuan helps Chinese
carriers by paring the repatriated value of dollar-denominated
debts built up from buying Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS planes.  China Southern didn’t say when it will publish earnings in
its Hong Kong stock exchange statement late yesterday. Profit in
the first nine months of last year totaled 322 million yuan ($48
million), under domestic accounting standards, according to the
statement.  In Hong Kong trading, China Southern fell 1.4 percent,
Shanghai-based China Eastern dropped 0.6 percent and Beijing-
based Air China declined 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
