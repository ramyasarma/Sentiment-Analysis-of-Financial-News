The U.K. government bond market
reached 1 trillion pounds ($1.59 trillion) for the first time on
Oct. 19, according to data from the nation’s Debt Management
Office  website .  There were 863 billion pounds of gilts outstanding at the
end of 2009, DMO data show. That amount reflects the value of
the debt when issued, according to the DMO  website . The country
is scheduled to issue 165 billion pounds of gilts in the year
that ends March 2011, down from the record 227.6 billion pounds
in the previous fiscal year.  Insurance companies and pension funds are the biggest group
of U.K. gilt holders, followed by foreign investors and the Bank
of England, the nation’s central bank, the data show.  The Bank of England, the largest U.K. government bond
investor of any institution, holds 198.27 billion pounds of
gilts as of the end of March, according to the DMO’s latest
data. The central bank bought bonds under its so-called
quantitative easing program to support the economy by keeping
interest rates low.  The minutes of the central bank’s October meeting,
published today, showed some policy makers thought more economic
stimulus may be needed, adding to speculation that the Bank of
England may buy more securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
