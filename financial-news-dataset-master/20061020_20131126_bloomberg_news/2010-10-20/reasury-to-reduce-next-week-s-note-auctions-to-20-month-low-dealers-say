The Treasury will sell $97 billion
in two-, five- and seven-year notes next week, the smallest
monthly offering of the securities since February 2009,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of primary dealers required
to bid at the auctions.  It would be the sixth straight month the government has
lowered its offering of the three maturities. The U.S. last sold
a smaller amount 20 months ago when it auctioned $94 billion of
the securities. The government will also sell $9 billion in
five-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities next week,
according to the survey of 10 of the 18 primary dealers.  “It reflects the waning financing needs of the
government,” said  Chris Ahrens , head interest-rate strategist
in Stamford, Connecticut, at primary dealer UBS AG. “Presuming
the economy follows its growth path, we would expect continued
very modest improvement in the deficit, which is still at
extraordinarily high levels.”  The government will auction $35 billion in two-year notes,
$34 billion in five-year notes and $28 billion in seven-year
securities, according to the average forecasts in the survey.
The daily note sales begin on Oct. 26. The U.S. will announce
the sizes of the sales tomorrow.  The Treasury has raised $1.249 trillion in new cash this
year selling Treasury securities, it said this week. The
department raised $1.504 trillion in new cash in 2009.  The world’s largest economy grew at a 1.7 percent pace in
the second quarter, down from 3.7 percent in the first three
months of 2010. It is projected to expand 1.89 percent in the
third quarter, according to the weighted average forecast of 65
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Budget Deficit  In September, the  budget  shortfall was $34.5 billion, the
second straight year of uninterrupted monthly deficits, compared
with $45.2 billion in September 2009, according to the Treasury.  The U.S. posted its second straight annual budget deficit
in excess of $1 trillion this month as lingering unemployment
constrained tax revenue, the Treasury said Oct. 15.  A  jobless rate  projected to exceed 9 percent through 2011
points to the difficulty of narrowing the budget gap even as the
global economic recovery boosts company profits and produces
more corporate tax receipts. Growth in government spending may
slow because of declining costs associated with the financial
crisis that spawned such rescue plans as the Troubled Asset
Relief Program.  At $35 billion, the two-year note auction would be the
smallest in size since October 2008, when $34 billion of the
securities were sold. A five-year offering of $34 billion would
be the least since March 2009, when the government sold an equal
amount of the debt. At $28 billion, the seven-year note auction
would be the smallest since August 2009.  The U.S. last sold 5-year TIPS in April, when it auctioned
$11 billion of the debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
