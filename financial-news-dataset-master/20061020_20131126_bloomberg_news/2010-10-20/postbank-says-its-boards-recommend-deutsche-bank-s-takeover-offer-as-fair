Deutsche Postbank AG  said its
supervisory and management boards welcomed the takeover offer by
 Deutsche Bank AG  and consider the bid price “appropriate.”  The boards “endorse the objective announced by Deutsche
Bank, of strengthening and expanding Deutsche Bank’s leading
position on the German home market,” the Bonn-based lender said
in a  statement  on its website today.  Deutsche Bank, led by Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann , is offering Postbank investors 25 euros a share to
increase its stake in the retail lender. The Frankfurt-based
bank said last week that shareholders representing about 0.05
percent of Postbank’s share capital had so far accepted the
takeover offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
