Mead Johnson Nutrition Co.  and juice
maker Hansen Natural Corp. are among the top candidates for
takeovers in the consumer-products industry because of their
growth prospects, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “The pace of deal activity in consumer staples has picked
up,” analysts including  Judy Hong  said in the report, citing
the takeovers of companies including Alberto-Culver Co. and
American Safety Razor Co. They also named  Lorillard Inc. , the
maker of Newport cigarettes, as a potential target.  The companies are grabbing bigger shares of sales in their
markets, making them ripe for consumer-products makers seeking
expansion, according to the report. Corona, California-based
Hansen, for example, reported a 22 percent increase in  revenue 
in its latest quarter, bolstered by sales of Monster Energy
drinks in the U.S. and abroad.  In the past year, there have been 48 deals in the U.S. in
the beverage industry alone, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Mead, based in Glenview, Illinois, gained 28 cents to
$57.68 at 9:38 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange  trading , while
Lorillard climbed 69 cents to $83.60. Hansen Natural rose 50
cents to $50.23 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  Representatives at Hansen couldn’t immediately be reached
for comment. Mead spokesman  Chris Perille  declined to comment,
as did Bob Bannon, a spokesman for Greensboro, North Carolina-
based Lorillard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
