Lee C. Bollinger  plans to continue
as president of Columbia University until 2016.  Bollinger, 64, agreed with the  board of trustees  yesterday
to a new contract that extends his term three years,  William Campbell , board chairman of the New York-based university, said
today in a telephone interview. Bollinger’s current contract was
set to expire in 2012, said Campbell, who wouldn’t disclose the
financial terms of the new deal.  Bollinger, who was hired in 2002, is leading Columbia’s
Manhattanville expansion, a $6.3 billion project that will add
17 acres to the university in Harlem over the next 20 years.
Under Bollinger, Columbia’s endowment increased to $6.5 billion
as of June 30 from $4.2 billion in 2002 and the number of
students applying to the Columbia College, the institution’s
largest undergraduate unit, climbed 50 percent, to 21,273 in
2009 from 14,135 in 2002. The university was ranked No. 4 in the
country this year by U.S. News & World Report magazine.  “We’re thrilled to have him committed for three more
years,” said Campbell, the chairman of  Intuit Inc ., based in
Mountain View, California. “He has done a magnificent job. We
didn’t want any speculation” about Bollinger’s status.  Bollinger received $1.75 million in salary, benefits and
other compensation from Columbia in 2008, the most recent year
for which Columbia’s tax records are available.  ‘Long Way’  Bollinger, a scholar of the U.S. Constitution and the First
Amendment, graduated from Columbia Law School and serves on its
faculty. He was president of the University of Michigan, in Ann
Arbor, from 1996 to 2002, and dean of Michigan’s law school from
1987 to 1994. He also worked as provost of Dartmouth College, in
Hanover, New Hampshire, from 1994 to 1996.  “Columbia has come a long way,” Bollinger said in an e-
mailed statement. “But its potential for the future is even
greater and I am extremely happy to be able to contribute to the
realization of that potential.”  Bollinger is deputy chair of the board of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, one of three members appointed to
represent the public.  Columbia, founded in 1754, has about 25,000 students.
Graduates include President  Barack Obama , former Federal Reserve
Chairman  Alan Greenspan , and  Warren Buffett , the chairman and
chief executive officer of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , who attended
Columbia Business School. It is one of eight private schools in
the northeastern U.S. that make up the Ivy League.  To contact the reporter on this story:
