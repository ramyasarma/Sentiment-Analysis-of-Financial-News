U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne pledged to spend money on carbon capture and
wind-energy technology.  “We commit public capital funding of up to 1 billion
pounds to one of the world’s first commercial scale carbon
capture and storage demonstration projects,” Osborne said while
delivering his spending review to lawmakers in Parliament in
London today. “We will also invest over 200 million pounds in
the development of off-shore wind technology and manufacturing
at port sites.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
