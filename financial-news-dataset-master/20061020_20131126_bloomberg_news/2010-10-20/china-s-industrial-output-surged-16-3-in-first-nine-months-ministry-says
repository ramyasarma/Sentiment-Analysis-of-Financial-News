China’s industrial-output growth
cooled to 16.3 percent in the first nine months of 2010,
adding to signs the economy is slowing even as the central
bank tightens monetary policy.  Minister of Industry and Information Technology  Li Yizhong  gave the figure in a statement posted on the
ministry’s website yesterday. It compares with 16.6 percent
growth in the first eight months from a year earlier.  China yesterday unexpectedly raised benchmark interest
rates as officials seek to curb lending, restrain inflation
and prevent a property-price bubble. Third-quarter economic
data, including industrial output numbers, is due to be
released in Beijing at 10 a.m. local time tomorrow.  “China’s growth momentum is slowing, but it is still at
a level that’s acceptable to policy makers,” said  Lu Zhengwei , a Shanghai-based economist at Industrial Bank Co.  The nine-month number released by Li matched the median
estimate in a  Bloomberg News survey  of five economists.  -- Sophie Leung ,  Li Yanping . Editors:  Paul Panckhurst ,  Cherian Thomas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
