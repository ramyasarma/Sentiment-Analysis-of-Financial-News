Sugar rose to the highest price in
eight months on forecasts for a smaller cane crop in Brazil, the
world’s largest producer. Robusta coffee climbed to a two-year
high, and cocoa also gained.  Brazil’s Center South, the top cane-growing region, will
produce 574.9 million metric tons this year, less than the 585.2
million tons forecast in July, industry researcher Datagro Ltd.
said this week. Acucar Guarani SA, a Brazilian processor, said
yesterday it will crush 5 percent less next year as drought
reduces crops.  “The drought in Brazil will definitely help out” in
boosting prices, said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld
Futures in Tampa, Florida. “If equities keep on rallying and
emerging markets keep on doing well, we’ll see a lot more demand
for sugar.”  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.48 cent, or 1.7
percent, to settle at 28.81 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached 29.15
cents, the highest level for a most-active contract since Feb.
3.  In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery rose
$12.40, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $730.60 a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  The dollar fell as much as 1.4 percent against a basket of
major currencies, boosting the appeal of raw materials.  ‘Bullish’ Backdrop  “The backdrop is bullish and any thousand-ton reduction in
output is going to add to that sentiment,” said  Abah Ofon , a
Dubai-based analyst at Standard Chartered. “The weaker dollar
is adding to that.”  In London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery
jumped $98, or 5.6 percent, to settle at $1,840 a ton. Earlier,
the price reached $1,850, the highest level since Oct. 20, 2008.  Coffee companies in Vietnam, the largest robusta producer,
expect the government to provide low-interest loans to help them
stockpile beans from the next crop, the Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa
Association said last week.  Prices have been driven by “speculative buying the last
couple of days because of a perceived window of opportunity
before the main Vietnamese harvest,” said  Andrea Thompson , a
Belfast, Northern Ireland-based analyst at researcher
CoffeeNetwork.  Global robusta demand will exceed supply by 1.6 million
bags in the year starting Oct. 1, Macquarie Group Ltd. said last
week. That matches the year-earlier shortfall. A bag weighs 132
pounds, or 60 kilograms.  Robusta, Arabica  Robusta beans, used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly
in Asia and parts of Africa. Arabica is grown mainly in Latin
America and brewed by specialty companies including Starbucks
Corp.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery rose 5.85
cents, or 3.1 percent, to settle at $1.9675 a pound in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $1.9815, the highest level since
Sept. 8.  Cocoa futures for December delivery rose $27, or 1 percent,
to settle at $2,777 a ton in New York.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery gained 7
pounds, or 0.4 percent, to 1,860 pounds ($2,950) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
