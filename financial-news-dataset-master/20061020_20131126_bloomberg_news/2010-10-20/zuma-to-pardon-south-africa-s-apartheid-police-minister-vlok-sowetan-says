South Africa’s former minister of
law and order, Adriaan Vlok, will be pardoned by President Jacob
Zuma for his conviction of attempted murder of an anti-apartheid
activist, the Sowetan reported, citing a government document.  Zuma will also pardon four members of the white extremist
group, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, who attacked a group of
black people in Northern Cape province in 1995, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said.   Vlok received a 10-year suspended jail sentence in 2007
after he pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of Frank
Chikane, a political activist who became head of the office of
former President Thabo Mbeki.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
