Investors should buy bullish
 McDonald’s Corp.  options because the world’s largest restaurant
chain may beat analyst estimates on rising sales when it reports
third-quarter results tomorrow, UBS AG said.  Equity derivatives strategist  Mitchell Revsine  recommended
buying a December $80 call while selling a December $70 put, a
strategy known as a risk reversal that is a proxy for owning the
stock. The stock climbed 0.8 percent to $77.62 as of 10 a.m. in
New York to extend this year’s gain to 24 percent, or almost
 five times  the gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
