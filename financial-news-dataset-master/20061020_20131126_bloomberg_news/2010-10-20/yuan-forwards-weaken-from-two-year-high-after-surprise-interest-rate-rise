Yuan forwards weakened, retreating
from a two-year high, on speculation China’s first interest-rate
increase since 2007 will alleviate the need for currency gains
to combat inflation.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.2 percent to
6.4513 per dollar as of 8:41 a.m. in Hong Kong, after yesterday
sliding 0.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The contracts reflect bets the currency will strengthen 3
percent from yesterday’s closing level of 6.6447 in Shanghai.
They reached 6.3920 on Oct. 18, the strongest level since a two-
year currency peg commenced in July 2008.  China’s central bank yesterday raised its benchmark one-
year lending rate to 5.56 percent from 5.31 percent, and the
deposit rate to 2.5 percent from 2.25 percent. Thirteen of 19
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News last month forecast that
rates would stay unchanged this year. Governor Zhou Xiaochuan on
Oct. 8 signaled that bank reserve requirements and bill sales
were sufficient tools to control inflation.  “The rate hikes show China won’t just rely on raising the
yuan to dampen inflation,” said  Gerrard Katz , the Hong-Kong
based head of foreign-exchange trading at Standard Chartered Plc.
“The yuan fixing might move up very slowly and it will start
moving faster again just before the G-20.”  A government report tomorrow is expected to show consumer
prices rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier in September, the
most in nearly two years, based on the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Finance ministers from the
Group of 20 nations will meet in Gyeongju, South Korea, this
week before the countries’ leaders meet for talks next month in
Seoul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
