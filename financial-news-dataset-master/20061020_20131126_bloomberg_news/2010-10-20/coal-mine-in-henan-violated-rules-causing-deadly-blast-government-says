China’s State Administration of Work
Safety said that violation of rules led to a blast at the coal
mine in Henan province that killed 37 miners, according to a
statement posted to the regulator’s website yesterday.  The accident occured as a vent was being dug to release
gases as part of safety measures, the statement said. The mine
didn’t take enough protective measures as required by rules and
had too many workers in the pit, according to the statement.  The coal mine didn’t learn a lesson from its previous blast
in 2008 which killed 23 people, the statement said. The
regulator also ordered a nationwide halt of production at coal
mines that can’t effectively prevent gas blasts, fires and
flooding, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
