Citadel LLC, the $11 billion firm
run by  Ken Griffin , plans to fire 12 people in sales and trading
within its securities unit, Citadel Securities, said a person
briefed on the plans.  The layoffs represent about 5 percent of the sales and
trading group, said the person, asking not to be named because
the information is private.  Devon Spurgeon , a spokeswoman for
Chicago-based Citadel, declined to comment.  Separately, Citadel’s co-head of equity derivatives,  James Boyle , left the firm today, Spurgeon said. Boyle joined Citadel
last year from Bank of America Corp., which bought Merrill Lynch
& Co., where Boyle worked for 13 years.  Brad Kurtzman , who ran equity derivatives with Boyle, is
now head of the group. Kurtzman also  joined  Citadel last year
from Bank of America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
