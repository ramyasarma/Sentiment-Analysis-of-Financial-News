Businesses and schools shut today in
Pakistan’s financial hub and largest city of Karachi after four
days of violence left 66 people dead.  A gun attack on the city’s Sher Shah Market yesterday
killed 13 people, said Karachi’s  chief of police , Fayyaz Leghari,
adding 60 had been injured in shootings this week. Police were
investigating the “causes and conspiracies behind the
violence,” Leghari said by phone, and had detained 85 suspects.  Political and communal killings have spiraled this year in
 Karachi , a port city of 18 million people, with members of the
ruling Pakistan People’s Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement,
and the Awami National Party shot dead in gun battles. This
week’s violence coincided with an Oct. 17 election to replace a
local MQM lawmaker assassinated at a mosque on Aug. 2.  The city is also used as a refuge by militants fleeing army
attacks on the Taliban in the country’s northwest.  Karachi serves as the Pakistan headquarters for companies
such as Citigroup Inc. and Unilever. Business leaders, transport
companies and political parties called for a complete shutdown
in the city to protest yesterday’s killings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
