Netflix Inc , the mail-order and
online movie-rental service, reported third-quarter profit rose
26 percent as the pace of new subscriber additions accelerated.
The shares surged.  Net income grew to $38 million, or 70 cents a share, from
$30.1 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier, Netflix said today
in a statement. Sales rose 31 percent to $553.2 million, beating
analysts’ projections of $551.7 million.  The company signed 1.93 million new users, up from 1.03
million in the second quarter, to reach 16.9 million. Chief
Executive Officer  Reed Hastings  has said Netflix will support
its online business by spending more to get movies and
television shows that can be delivered through the Internet to
computers and Web-connected TVs.  “You are beginning to see rapid growth in subscribers,”
said  Edward Woo , an analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities, which
has an “underperform” rating on the stock.  Netflix rose $9.75, or 6.4 percent to $162.90 in extended
trading. The shares gained $3.82 to $153.15 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading  and have almost tripled this
year.  Profit missed the 71-cent average of 27 analysts’
 estimates . Investors are focusing more on the increases in
customers, Woo said in an interview.  Total subscribers increased 52 percent from 11.1 million a
year earlier and 13 percent from the second quarter, the company
said. Netflix, which also offers DVDs by mail, said 66 percent
of customers used the Web service, up from 61 percent in the
second quarter.  ‘Streaming Company’  “By every measure we are now a streaming company, which
also offers DVD-by-mail,” Hastings said in comments posted on
the company’s  website . “In Q4, we’ll spend more on streaming
content than DVD content, and we’ll deliver many more hours of
entertainment via streaming than on DVD.”  Netflix reported gross margin, the share of revenue left
after subscription and fulfillment costs, amounted to 37.7
percent, compared with 34.9 percent a year earlier and 39.4
percent in the second quarter. Customer turnover dropped to 3.8
percent from 4 percent in the second quarter.  Netflix raised its year-end subscriber forecast to as much
as 19.7 million from up to 18.5 million previously. Sales this
quarter will be $586 million to $598 million. The company
projects net income of $32 million to $40 million, and earnings
of 59 cents to 74 cents a share, unchanged from prior forecasts.  (Netflix plans a conference call at 6 p.m. New York time.
