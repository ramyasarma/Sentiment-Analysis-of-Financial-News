Sweden’s krona gained against the
dollar and euro as advances in U.S. equities fueled optimism
that investors are turning less risk averse.  The krona rallied from its weakest level in two weeks
against the dollar. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.2
percent at 4.50 p.m. in London after losing 1.6 percent
yesterday. The krona fell yesterday after China raised its
benchmark lending and deposit rates for the first time since
2007, boosting the one-year lending rate to 5.56 percent from
5.31 percent  “People were a bit afraid yesterday that China’s rate hike
would dampen the global growth picture so we had a selloff in
smaller currencies and a stronger rebound of the U.S. dollar,”
said  Elisabeth Andreew , chief currency strategist at Nordea Bank
AB in Copenhagen. “Markets have calmed down.”  The krona appreciated 2.2 percent to 6.6568 per dollar. It
earlier declined to 6.8233, the weakest level since Sept. 28.
The Swedish currency strengthened 0.5 percent versus the euro to
9.2927. The Norwegian krone appreciated 2.1 percent to 5.8195
per dollar. It was 0.3 percent stronger at 8.1337 versus the
euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
