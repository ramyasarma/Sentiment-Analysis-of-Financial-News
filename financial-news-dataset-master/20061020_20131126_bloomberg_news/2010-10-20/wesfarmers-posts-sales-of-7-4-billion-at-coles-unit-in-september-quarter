Wesfarmers Ltd. , Australia’s second-
largest retailer, said first quarter sales at its Coles
supermarket and convenience stores rose 4.9 percent on revamped
fresh food areas and lower prices.  Coles’ revenue rose to A$7.49 billion ($7.4 billion) in the
13 weeks ended Sept. 26 from A$7.14 billion a year earlier,
Perth-based Wesfarmers said in a statement today. Sales were
expected to grow 4.2 percent, according to the median estimate
of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Growth rates at the chain are outpacing larger rival
Woolworths Ltd. as Coles Managing Director  Ian McLeod  opens
outlets with more selling space for fresh fruit and vegetables
and shelf prices are cut to reverse market-share losses.  Sales at Coles supermarkets rose 5.9 percent to A$6 billion
and revenue from convenience stores gained 1.2 percent to A$1.5
billion. Woolworths yesterday reported first-quarter food and
liquor sales growth of 3.2 percent.  At supermarkets open at least a year, Coles posted growth
of 6.2 percent. Woolworths yesterday reported same-store sales
growth of 2 percent.  Same-store or comparable sales strip out the effects of
recently opened or sold outlets and are adjusted for the
transfer of 22 former Coles supermarkets to independently owned
retail group FoodWorks.  Wesfarmers  shares closed yesterday at A$32.93 and have
gained 5.3 percent this year. That compares with a 3.1 percent
advance for Sydney-based Woolworths and a 5 percent decline in
the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  Retail Sales  The company reported sales today for only its four retail
divisions of Coles, Kmart, Target and the combined home
improvement and office supplies unit.  Wesfarmers , which also
mines coal, produces fertilizer and sells insurance, reports
first-half earnings in February.  Sales at  Wesfarmers ’ home improvement and office supplies
division rose 4.8 percent to A$2 billion in the quarter. At
Bunnings, Australia’s largest hardware chain, sales rose 3.9
percent to A$1.6 billion. Revenue from Officeworks gained 9.1
percent to A$360 million,  Kmart discount department store sales rose 3.7 percent to
A$926 million while Target outlets posted a 1.4 percent drop in
revenue to A$847 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
