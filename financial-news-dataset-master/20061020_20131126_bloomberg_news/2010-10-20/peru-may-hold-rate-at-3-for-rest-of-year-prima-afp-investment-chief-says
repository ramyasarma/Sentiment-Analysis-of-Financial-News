Peru’s central bank may keep its
 benchmark lending rate  at 3 percent for the rest of this year in
a bid to stem inflows that last month sent the sol to its
strongest level in more than two years, said the investment
chief at Prima AFP, the Andean country’s biggest pension fund.  The bank may raise the rate if  consumer price growth 
becomes unhinged,  Alejandro Perez-Reyes  told reporters today in
Lima. Inflation is currently under control, he said. Perez-Reyes
manages $9.1 billion at Prima AFP.  The “robust” growth of the Peruvian economy will probably
oblige the bank to raise rates in 2011, Perez-Reyes said. If
central banks in other countries keep rates steady, Peru will
need to apply measures, including higher reserve requirements,
to stem the inflow of foreign capital, he said.  “We’re going to see upward movements in the central bank’s
rate next year,” he said. “If there is a strong influx of
speculative capital it will take measures to prevent this
speculation from affecting the currency in a big way.”  Peru’s central bank kept its benchmark lending rate
unchanged Oct. 7 after five previous rate increases helped damp
inflation and slow economic growth. Consumer prices declined
0.03 percent last month from August.  Peru’s economy unexpectedly accelerated in August on a
surge in manufacturing as domestic demand rebounds and the
country boosts exports of metals, textiles and food.  The sol gained 0.2 percent to 2.7905 per dollar at 1:28
p.m. New York time, from 2.7950 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
