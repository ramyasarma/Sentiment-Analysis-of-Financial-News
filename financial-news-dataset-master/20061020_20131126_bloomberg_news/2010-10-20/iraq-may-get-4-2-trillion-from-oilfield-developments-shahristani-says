Iraq may earn $4.2 trillion in
revenue from oil fields being developed by international
companies after rights for production from the deposits were
auctioned last year, Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said.  The fields, whose development rights were assigned after
two bid rounds held last year, will produce 60 billion barrels
of oil, he said. The Iraqi government will get 99 percent of the
revenue from those deposits, al-Shahristani said today opening
the country’s third hydrocarbon bid round in Baghdad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
