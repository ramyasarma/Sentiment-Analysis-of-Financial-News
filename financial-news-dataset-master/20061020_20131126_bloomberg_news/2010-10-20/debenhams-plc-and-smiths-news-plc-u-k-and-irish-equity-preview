U.K. stocks  rose to their highest
level since April amid optimism that earnings growth in the
third quarter is underpinning a recovery in the global economy.  Debenhams Plc soared 7 percent as the retailer reported
higher pretax profit as its online sales climbed. BT Group Plc
rallied 4.1 percent as concern faded about the company’s pension
plan.  Britvic Plc  rallied 5.7 percent after the maker of Tango
soda and Robinson’s drinks reported a surge in sales.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index gained 28.93, or 0.5 percent,
to 5,757.86 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has
risen 3.8 percent this month amid speculation that central banks
will ease monetary policy further to support the economic
recovery. The  FTSE All-Share Index  also advanced 0.5 percent
today and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  added 3.1 percent.  “The climate for equities has improved rather
significantly and valuations are rather compelling,”  Andrew Popper , chief investment officer at SG Hambros Bank Ltd. in
London, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview. “The earnings are
very, very good. We are buying equities.”  Debenhams  surged 7 percent to 76.5 pence as the U.K.’s
second-biggest department-store chain said profit before taxes
and exceptional items rose to 151 million pounds ($237.7
million) from 125.2 million pounds a year earlier as it added
more profitable designer labels and shoppers bought more
products online.  BT, Britvic Rally  BT gained 4.1 percent to 156.3 pence. The U.K. government
lost a court fight to limit its liability for BT’s employee
pension plan if Britain’s largest phone company were to
collapse.  “This should support our view that the pension issues
facing BT are a reducing concern,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst
 Paul Howard  wrote in a report today. He maintains his
“overweight” recommendation on the shares.  Britvic  rallied 5.7 percent to 497.3 pence. The drinks
maker said full-year sales rose 15 percent as fiscal fourth-
quarter revenue climbed 33 percent.  Tullow Oil Plc  slid 2.1 percent to 1,227 pence. The oil
exploration company said its Onyina-1 exploration well in the
Deepwater Tano license off the coast of Ghana encountered water-
bearing reservoirs.  TUI Travel Plc tumbled 11 percent to 205 pence. The
company’s audit for the full-year ended September 2009
identified a further 88 million pounds of irrecoverable balances
that it needs to write off, giving a total writedown of 117
million pounds, the company said in a statement.  Paul Bowtell ,
its chief financial offer, will leave the company at the end of
this year.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc lost 1.3 percent to 1,275 pence as the
U.K.’s largest drugmaker said third-quarter profit showed little
change, held back by costs tied to the Avandia diabetes
treatment and generic competition to its Valtrex medicine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
