The pound weakened against the euro
after minutes from the Bank of England’s most-recent meeting
showed policy makers split three ways on whether to maintain the
central bank’s bond-buying plan.  The U.K. currency depreciated as much as 0.8 percent to
88.09 pence per euro and was at 87.97 pence as of 9:34 a.m. in
London. Against the dollar it was little changed at $1.5708
after rising as much as 0.3 percent.  The Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor  Mervyn King ,
voted 7-1-1 to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent
and the bond-purchase plan at 200 billion pounds ($313 billion),
the meeting minutes showed.  “Some of the members felt the likelihood that further
monetary stimulus would become necessary in order to meet the
inflation target in the medium term had increased in recent
months,” the minutes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
