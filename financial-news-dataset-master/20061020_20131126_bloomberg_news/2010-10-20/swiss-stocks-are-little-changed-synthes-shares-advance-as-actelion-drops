Swiss stocks swung between gains and
losses. Synthes Inc., the world’s largest maker of bone-related
medical devices, rose after U.S. peer Stryker Corp. upgraded its
2010 profit forecast.       Transocean Ltd. , owner of the Deepwater Horizon
offshore rig in the Gulf of Mexico that sank in April, fell 1.5
percent.  The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  of the biggest and most
actively traded companies rose 0.1 percent to 6,478.15 at 12:15
p.m. in Zurich. The gauge has dropped 7 percent from this year’s
high on April 15 as concern re-emerged that a sovereign-debt
crisis in Europe will crimp economic growth and a U.S. recovery
is faltering. The broader  Swiss Performance Index  also gained
0.1 percent today.  Synthes  climbed 1.5 percent to 118.5 Swiss francs. Stryker
rose 6 percent in Europe after the maker of artificial body
parts and hospital equipment said it expects to earn between
$3.27 and $3.30 a share in 2010. Analysts, on average, had
estimated profit of $3.26, according to a Bloomberg survey. The
company had previously given a forecast of $3.20 to $3.30 a
share.       Transocean  fell 1.5 percent to 64.2 francs. The U.S.
federal judge who overturned a moratorium on deep-water drilling
threw out regulations issued after the oil spill, saying the
government failed to give proper notice for its rulemaking.  Valiant Holding AG  tumbled for a fifth day after Vontobel
Holding AG downgraded the regional retail bank to “reduce”
from “hold.” Valiant slumped 8.8 percent to 160.7 francs,
following on from yesterday’s 8.2 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
