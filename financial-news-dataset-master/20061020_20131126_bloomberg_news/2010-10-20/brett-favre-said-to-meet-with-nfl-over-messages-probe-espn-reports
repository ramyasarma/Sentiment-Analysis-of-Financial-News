Minnesota Vikings quarterback  Brett Favre  met with National Football League officials to discuss
allegations he sent explicit messages to a female employee of
the New York Jets, ESPN said, without revealing where it got the
information.  Details about the talks with  Milt Ahlerich , the NFL’s vice
president for security, weren’t disclosed, the report said. The
case may collapse if the woman doesn’t cooperate, the sports
network said.  Favre, 41, is accused of sending mobile communications of a
sexual nature to the woman two years ago, while he played for
the Jets, ESPN said. Favre hasn’t commented on the allegations.  NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  declined to discuss the meeting,
ESPN said.  The Vikings next game is Oct. 24 at the Green Bay Packers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
