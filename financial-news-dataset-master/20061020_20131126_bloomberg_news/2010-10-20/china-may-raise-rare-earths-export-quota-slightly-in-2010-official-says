China may raise its export quota for
rare earths used in electronics, alternative energy and weapons,
according to an official who until last week oversaw the
industry in the country.  Rising demand and a drop in inventories may prompt the
government to increase output, Wang Caifeng, former deputy
director at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology,
said in an interview today.  “My personal opinion is that China might raise the
production cap and export quota slightly next year,” Wang, now
in charge of setting up the China Rare Earth Industry
Association, said by phone from Beijing. “The industry’s been
destocking its raw material inventory this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
