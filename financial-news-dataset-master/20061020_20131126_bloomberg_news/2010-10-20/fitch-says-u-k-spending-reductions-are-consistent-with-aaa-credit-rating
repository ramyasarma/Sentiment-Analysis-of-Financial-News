The U.K. government’s Comprehensive
Spending Review, announced today by Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne, is consistent with a top AAA rating, Fitch
Ratings said in a statement today.  The review “enhances the credibility of the U.K. budget
reduction plan,” the statement said. “Despite the pace of
fiscal consolidation, Fitch expects the U.K. economic recovery
to continue, albeit at a modest pace.”  “Delivering on the Spending Review and deficit reduction
plan will be challenging, especially against the backdrop of a
modest economic recovery,” David Riley, Head of Sovereign
Ratings at Fitch, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
