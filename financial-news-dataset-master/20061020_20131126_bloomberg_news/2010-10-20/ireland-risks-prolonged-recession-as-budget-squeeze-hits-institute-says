Ireland’s government risks pushing
its economy into a “prolonged recession” as it tries to cut
its budget deficit and lower borrowing costs, the country’s
Economic & Social Research Institute said.  Ireland needs 15 billion euros ($21 billion) in savings,
double the existing program, to meet a 2014 target agreed with
the European Union, the Dublin-based  institute  said in a report
today. The cuts may push the economy “close to a tipping
point,” ESRI economist  Ide Kearney  said at a briefing
yesterday.  Irish sovereign  borrowing costs  soared this year on concern
the cost of bailing out banks would lead to a default. The
bailout will push the budget gap to 32 percent of gross domestic
product this year and the government aims to reduce it to the EU
limit of 3 percent in four years. Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan 
will outline his budget plan next month.  Excluding the cost of the bank bailout, the budget deficit
will be about 12 percent of GDP this year, still the highest in
the 16-nation euro region.  The ESRI favors extending the program to 2016, which it
said would require 13 billion euros in savings.  “Not many people in the world believe we are going to make
3 percent of GDP by 2014,” said ESRI economist  Alan Barrett .
“We think you may gain in credibility by having a program out
there that people believe you are going to have a chance of
meeting.”  Still, such an extension is “highly unlikely” given
current constraints, he said.  Bond Yields  The  premium  investors demand to hold 10-year Irish bonds
over German bunds, Europe’s benchmark, was at 388 basis points
late yesterday in Dublin, down from a record 454 on Sept. 29.
The equivalent yield spread for  Greece  was at 657 basis points,
while Portugal’s was at 332 basis points.  The ESRI now sees the economy shrinking 0.25 percent this
year rather than growing 0.25 percent. It sees growth of 2.25
percent in 2011, lower than the 2.75 percent expansion
previously forecast.  The economy may expand about 2.25 percent a year between
2011 and 2015 under a “low growth” scenario on which the ESRI
based its budget forecasts.  The pace of the recovery means  unemployment  will remain
close to its current level through 2011, according to the
institute. It sees the jobless rate averaging 13.5 percent next
year. The rate has tripled in the last three years and was at
13.7 percent in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
