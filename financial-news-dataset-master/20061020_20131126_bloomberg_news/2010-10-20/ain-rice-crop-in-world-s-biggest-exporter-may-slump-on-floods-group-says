Flash floods in Thailand, the
world’s biggest rice exporter, may reduce production from the
nation’s main rice crop by as much as 20 percent, an industry
group said.  “Production of main crop rice may fall by around 15 to 20
percent from last year, to less than 20 million metric tons,”
Banjong Tungjitwattanakun, vice president of the Thai Rice Mills
Association, said in a telephone interview.  Output from the main rice crop last year totaled 23.3
million tons, according to data from the Agricultural Economics
Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
