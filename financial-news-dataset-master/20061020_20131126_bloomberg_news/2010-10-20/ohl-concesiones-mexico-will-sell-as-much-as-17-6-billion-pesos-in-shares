OHL Concesiones Mexico SA, the unit
of Spanish construction company Obrascon Huarte Lain SA, plans
to raise up to 16.6 billion pesos ($1.4 billion) in the largest
initial public offering in Mexico in at least 16 years.  The shares may be priced at 24 pesos to 30 pesos each,
Mexico City-based OHL said in a filing. The company may offer as
many as 552 million shares, making it the biggest IPO in value
since at least 1994, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Grupo Comercial Chedraui SAB broke a 22-month drought of
IPOs in Mexico in April. At least two more companies may sell
stock in the nation before the end of the year, Bolsa Mexicana
de Valores SAB Chief Executive Officer  Luis Tellez  said on Aug.
3. OHL plans to use the money to finance investment projects and
expand, according to the prospectus.  The sale “would unseal the value of the Mexican
concessions,” said  Pablo Ortiz , an analyst with Interdin Bolsa
SVB SA in Madrid. “I think those concessions are high quality
and are very undervalued.”  OHL hired the local units of Banco Santander SA and Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA to handle the offering, which may
occur between Nov. 4 and Nov. 11, according to the filing.
Shares will be offered to Mexican and international investors,
the company said.  More Contracts  OHL won its sixth  contract  to build and manage a highway in
Mexico in June. The company has a 49 percent stake in the
operator of the Toluca airport outside Mexico City, according to
its website.  The Mexican company wants to repeat the success of an IPO
by the Brazilian unit of Obrascon, Ortiz said. The Brazilian
shares have more than tripled to 56.70  reais  since trading began
in 2005.     Obrascon rose 3.9 percent to 24.6 euros in Madrid
trading and is up 29 this year.  OHL reported revenue of 11.3 billion pesos in 2009, an
increase of 60 percent from a year earlier, according to the
prospectus. Traffic on the toll roads OHL operates in Mexico
rose 18 percent in 2008 from 2007 and revenue gained 23 percent,
according to an  annual report .  To contact the reporters on this story:
