Sinofert Holdings Ltd ., 22 percent
held by  Potash Corp . of Saskatchewan, said it signed an
agreement for the purchase of Canadian potash from Canpotex
Ltd., a venture 33.3 percent owned by its shareholder.  The accord, which must be disclosed because it’s between
connected parties, caps annual buying at $600 million next year,
$730 million in 2012 and $870 million in 2013, Hong Kong-based
Sinofert said in a filing to the city’s stock exchange today.  Sinofert’s parent Sinochem Group, China’s largest
fertilizer trader, has been cited by analysts as a likely
counter bidder to  BHP Billiton Ltd.  for Potash. Sinochem may
struggle to get Chinese government financial backing for a
purchase, two people with knowledge of the matter said Oct. 7.  Sinochem Fertilizer Macao Commercial Offshore, a Sinofert
unit, agreed to buy at least 1 million metric tons, or 33.3
percent of total seaborne potash imports into China, according
to the statement. Minimum purchases will rise to 1.05 million
tons in 2012 and 1.1 million tons in 2013.  The deal is exclusive; Sinochem Macao will purchase
Canadian potash solely from Canpotex, and Canpotex won’t sell to
any other buyers in China, Sinofert said. The agreement is
subject to shareholder approval.  Sinofert fell 1.1 percent to HK$4.52 in Hong Kong trading
today, before the announcement. The stock has risen 4.2 percent
this year, compared with a 7.7 percent gain in the city’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index.  The announcement didn’t include terms of any individual
purchases of potash.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
