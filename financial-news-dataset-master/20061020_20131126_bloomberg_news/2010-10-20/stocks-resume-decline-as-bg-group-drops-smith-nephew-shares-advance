U.K. stocks  climbed for the second
time in three days as Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
detailed the deepest ever cuts to Britain’s budget.  Stagecoach Group Plc, Go-Ahead Group Plc and National
Express Group Plc surged after the government retained bus
subsidies. Xstrata Plc and Anglo American Plc led a gauge of
mining companies higher as copper advanced in London. Smith &
Nephew Plc advanced 3.2 percent after U.S. rival Stryker Corp.
raised its earnings forecast.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  rose 25.04, or 0.4 percent, to
5,728.93 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, having swung between
gains and losses at least 10 times today. The gauge has risen
3.3 percent this month amid optimism central banks are prepared
to ease monetary policy further to support the economic
recovery. The  FTSE All-Share Index  gained 0.4 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 0.4 percent.  The impact of the government’s spending review “has been
well digested by investors over the weeks running up to today’s
announcement,” wrote  Jeremy Thomas , chief investment officer
for U.K. equities at the RCM unit of Allianz Global Investors,
which manages about $1.1 trillion. “Markets detest uncertainty,
and in combination with yesterday’s Strategic Defence Review,
getting these announcements behind us could be helpful.”  Detailed Cuts  Osborne today detailed cuts to the U.K.’s budget that
eliminate almost half a million public-sector jobs. The plans
would reduce public spending by 83 billion pounds ($131 billion)
after inflation, narrowing a deficit that the government
forecasts at 10.1 percent of gross domestic product this year to
2.1 percent of GDP in the 2014-15 fiscal year. Debt interest
costs would fall by more than 5 billion pounds by 2015.  Xstrata rallied 3.4 percent to 1,291 pence, Anglo American
Plc increased 3.2 percent to 2,871 pence and Rio Tinto Group
climbed 2.7 percent to 4,056 pence.  A gauge of mining shares on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
rallied 2.1 percent, paring a three-day selloff. Copper prices
rebounded from the biggest drop in three months as a slide in
the dollar enhanced the appeal of commodities as alternative
investments.  Stagecoach, the operator of Britain’s busiest commuter-rail
service, surged 9.4 percent to 205.1 pence, the biggest gain
since September, 2009. Go-Ahead advanced 7.7 percent to 1,227
pence and National Express added 4.7 percent to 249.4 pence.  Osborne said that bus subsidies paid directly to operators
will be reduced by 20 percent, saving 300 million pounds by
2015.  Less Than Suspected  “The cut in the direct subsidy is less than the market had
suspected,” said  Geoff van Klaveren , a transport analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG in London with a “buy” rating on Stagecoach
stock. “The concern was that it would be cut completely.”  BAE Systems Plc, Europe’s largest defense company, dropped
2 percent to 349.9 pence. The shares fell as Osborne confirmed
the budget for the Ministry of Defence will reach 33.5 billion
pounds in 2014-15, a saving of 8 percent over the period.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  yesterday announced the
scrapping of an order for BAE’s Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft
and said fewer, cheaper planes are needed for new aircraft
carriers.  Smith & Nephew  increased 3.2 percent to 568 pence after
Stryker, the U.S. maker of artificial body parts and hospital
equipment, said it expects to earn between $3.27 and $3.30 a
share in 2010. That topped analyst estimates of $3.26 a share.  The following stocks also rose or fell in London and
Dublin. Stock symbols are in parentheses:  Autonomy Plc  (AU/ LN), the U.K.’s second-largest software
company, rallied 4.2 percent to 1,505 pence after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said in a report today that the company remained
“the premier strategic asset in the software sector and could
appeal to a platform vendor.” The bank also maintained their
“buy” recommendation on the shares.  Hansen Transmissions International NV  (HSN LN) plunged 15
percent to 43 pence, a record low. The maker of products used in
wind generators and cooling towers said revenue for the 2011
fiscal year will fall about 10 percent from 2010. The company
had previously forecast revenue to grow between 5 percent and 10
percent.  Home Retail Group Plc  (HOME LN) lost 2.4 percent to 214.7
pence after the U.K. owner of the Homebase home-improvement
chain and Argos catalog stores reported a 23 percent drop in
first-half pretax profit to 94.7 million pounds.       Stobart Group Ltd.  (STOB LN) dropped 8.6 percent to 143
pence after the U.K. trucking company cut its full-year profit
forecast. Reduced spending by Network Rail and increased overall
finance costs will affect profit, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
