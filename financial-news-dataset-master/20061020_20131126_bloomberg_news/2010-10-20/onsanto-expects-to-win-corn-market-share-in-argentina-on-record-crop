Monsanto Co. , the world’s largest
seed company, expects to boost its market share of corn seeds in
Argentina on forecasts that farmers will plant a record crop.  Monsanto, based in St. Louis, will likely take 52 percent
of the market for corn seeds this year, up from 50 percent last
year, Pablo Ogallar, the company’s head of marketing in
Argentina, said today in an interview. An increase in the crop
size from a year ago also means total sales will climb, he said.  Argentina, the world’s second-largest corn exporter after
the U.S., will grow a record 26 million tons of the grain in the
2010-2011 season, according to the Agricultural Ministry. This
year’s harvest was about 22 million tons, matching a previous
record that Argentine farmers had in the 2007-2008 season.  The final crop size this season “will depend on
availability of seeds because companies expected an increase in
planting, but not this big,” Ogallar said. More corn is being
planted than originally forecast because of high global prices
of the grain, which reached a two-year high last week, and good
weather conditions, he said.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 16 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $5.62 a bushel at 10:40 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. On Oct. 13, the price reached $5.88, the highest level
for a most-active contract since August 2008.  Regional Revenue  Monsanto’s corn business in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay,
Chile and Bolivia represented about $400 million in sales in the
2009-2010 season, about 75 percent of its total regional revenue
of about $650 million, according to Ogallar. Argentina
represents about 80 percent of the unit’s sales, he said.  The South American business accounts for about 8 percent of
Monsanto’s global corn seed sales. Monsanto does not sell
soybean seeds in Argentina, the world’s third-largest producer.  Monsanto gained 46 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $57.76 in New
York Stock Exchange Composite trading at 1:44 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
