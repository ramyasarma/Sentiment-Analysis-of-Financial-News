PGE SA , Poland’s largest power
utility, which last month agreed to buy Energa SA from the
government, today asked for approval from the antitrust
regulator, which has opposed the deal.  State-controlled  PGE , which wants to pay 7.53 billion zloty
($2.6 billion) for a majority stake in Energa, the fourth-
largest power group, plans to complete the transaction by the
end of this year, Tomasz Zadroga, chief executive officer of
Warsaw-based PGE, said last month.  PGE won’t disclose details of the request, it said in an e-
mailed statement today. The watchdog has two months to decide on
the transaction, which accounts for 30 percent of this year’s 25
billion-zloty government asset-sale target.  Malgorzata Krasnodebska-Tomkiel , the head of the regulator,
has said since March she won’t allow the purchase because it
would hurt customers by giving the new company a dominant market
position. On Sept. 16 she told Bloomberg News she was “open to
any new arguments that the government might have.”  Prime Minister Donald Tusk says the deal is needed to help
PGE develop Poland’s first nuclear power plant. Tusk said Oct. 5
he planned to meet Tomkiel this month to discuss the sale.  The Treasury Ministry has raised about  17 billion zloty  so
far this year selling companies, excluding Energa. Other assets
for sale in 2010 include a stake in Enea SA, the third-largest
utility, valued at 5.2 billion zloty at today’s stock price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
