Iberdrola SA , Spain’s largest power
company, borrowed 803 million euros ($1.1 billion) in the first
nine months to cover costs that the government wouldn’t let it
immediately pass on to customers.  The addition amounted to more than half of the increase in
Iberdrola’s net debt, which climbed to 30.1 billion euros at
Sept. 30 from 28.5 billion euros on Dec. 31. The 803 million
euros financed expenses such as transporting electricity and
paying a premium rate for renewable power, the Bilbao-based
company said today in a  filing .  For most of the past 10 years, Spain has capped the tariff,
or rate, that utilities charge customers at below what the power
companies need to cover approved costs, generating what’s called
a tariff deficit. A government-ordered bond sale is set to begin
this month to resume repayment of the funds owed to the
utilities, including Enel Spa’s Endesa unit.  Iberdrola’s new borrowings increased its total accumulated
tariff-deficit debt to 4.42 billion euros, or 15 percent of
total debt, from 9.8 percent at mid-year 2009.  The extra debt weighs on earnings. Net income rose to 2.07
billion euros ($2.85 billion) from 2.03 billion euros a year
earlier, Iberdrola reported today in a filing.  Paying Shortfalls  To finance tariff deficits, Spanish utilities must borrow
funds much like governments finance budget deficits when tax
revenue falls short of public spending. The Spanish utilities
together are owed about 14.6 billion euros. The money gets
repaid to them over time from a surcharge on future consumer
bills.  For every 100 euros paid by Spanish homes and businesses
for electricity, 5.7 euros goes to pay off previous years’
shortfalls, according to a report this year by the utility trade
group Unesa.  To contact the reporters on this story:
