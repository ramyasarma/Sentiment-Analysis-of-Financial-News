Mauritius’s economy will probably
grow less than 4 percent this year, below previous forecasts, on
weakening demand from Europe, Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth
said.  The forecast was reduced from the 4.2 percent estimated
three months ago by the government and compares with the 4.1
percent predicted by the statistics agency on Sept. 30.  “The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank say
that the euro crisis will last four years or even more,”
Jugnauth told reporters today in the capital, Port Louis, after
returning from a trip to the U.S. “They say that the situation
will deteriorate further.”  About two-thirds of the tourists who visit Mauritius come
from Europe, which also accounts for 71 percent of manufactured
exports, according to the statistics agency. The economic crisis
in the euro region prompted the government to present a 12-
billion rupee ($397 million) plan on Aug. 13 to help the economy
withstand the impact.  The Finance Ministry has “limited leeway” in the
preparation of the 2011 budget, due in November, because of the
economic slowdown, Jugnauth said.  “We will have to be courageous enough to take some
measures to face the future,” he said, without specifying
whether they will include spending cuts or higher taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
