Angolan  crude exports will drop in
December as a disruption at the Plutonio terminal reduce
shipments from the nation on Africa’s southwest coast, loading
schedules show.  At least 48 crude cargoes will load in December, compared
with 54 shipments in November, according to a revised loading
plan obtained by Bloomberg. That includes three shipments of
Palanca crude whose schedule wasn’t previously available.  A total of 45.6 million barrels, or 1.47 million barrels a
day, will be exported in December, the data shows. That compares
with 1.72 million barrels originally scheduled for November. The
December plan excludes so-called pooled cargoes, which aren’t
assigned to a specific lifter. At least one pooled cargoes was
scheduled for November.  At least three  Plutonio  shipments, originally planned for
December, have been dropped from the plan because of the
terminal disruption, according to two traders with knowledge of
operations. That reduced the December plan by 96,774 barrels a
day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
