Michelle Rhee , who resigned as
schools chancellor of the District of Columbia, is “seriously
considering” becoming New Jersey’s next education commissioner,
the Star-Ledger reported, citing two unidentified people
familiar with the negotiations.  New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie ’s office asked Rhee, 40,
to become the state’s education commissioner, the Star-Ledger
 said  today. Rhee’s desire to be close to family in California
may prove too big an obstacle to convince her, the newspaper
said. Rhee initially turned down the offer after assuming the
state wanted her to run the Newark public schools, according to
the report.  Rhee’s announced her resignation last week as D.C.
chancellor, a post she’s held since 2007, without saying what
her plans were. She will leave the job at the end of the month.  Emily Lenzner, a spokeswoman for Rhee, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail from Bloomberg seeking comment. Christie’s
office declined to discuss or identify potential candidates in
advance of a nomination, said spokesman  Michael Drewniak . The
New Jersey Department of Education didn’t immediately return a
phone call requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
