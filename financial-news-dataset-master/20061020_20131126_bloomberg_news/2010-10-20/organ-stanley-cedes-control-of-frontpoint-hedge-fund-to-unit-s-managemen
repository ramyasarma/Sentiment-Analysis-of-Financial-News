Morgan Stanley , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, agreed to give up control of its FrontPoint
Partners LLC hedge-fund unit, four years after it bought the
firm as part of a push into alternative assets.  FrontPoint’s managers, led by co-chief executive officers
 Daniel Waters  and  Michael Kelly , are gaining a majority stake in
the asset manager and will replace Morgan Stanley affiliates as
the funds’ investment adviser and general partner, the New York-
based bank said today in a statement. Morgan Stanley will
maintain a minority stake. Terms of the agreement, which the
company expects to complete by year-end, weren’t disclosed.  “I am especially pleased that my fellow portfolio managers
support the restructuring of our relationship with Morgan
Stanley, and that the FrontPoint investment culture will not
change,” FrontPoint Senior Portfolio Manager  Steve Eisman  said
in a separate statement.  Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman  said in
July that the firm was looking at its investments in hedge
funds, including FrontPoint. While the so-called Volcker rule
limits banks’ investments in hedge funds, it would not have
affected the FrontPoint stake because Morgan Stanley had not
contributed much of its own capital into the actual funds.  Morgan Stanley  purchased  FrontPoint in 2006. The firm paid
$400 million for the stake, people familiar with the terms said
at the time. Morgan Stanley still holds minority stakes in
Avenue Capital Group and Lansdowne Partners, which it also
bought in 2006.  FrontPoint had about $7 billion in assets as of Dec. 31,
according to a Barron’s  survey , which ranked the firm’s
quantitative macro fund 57th in its Top 100 Hedge Funds.  Philip Duff , 53, co-founded FrontPoint with  Gil Caffray ,
57, and  Paul Ghaffari  in 2000. Duff and Caffray were previously
managing directors at Tiger Management LLC, the firm founded by
 Julian Robertson  that was once the world’s biggest hedge-fund
manager.  To contact the reporters on this story:
