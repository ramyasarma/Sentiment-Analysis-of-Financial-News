Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average,
which has lost 9.6 percent this year, may rise 20 percent
through February next year, according to a technical analysis by
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.  The gauge may climb toward 11,408, the intraday high for
the year achieved on April 5, said  Naohiko Miyata , chief
technical strategist at the brokerage unit of Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest bank by market value.
Miyata says the gauge may be set for a sustained period of
advance as the yen enters its final phase of gains against the
dollar and after the measure found support at a key Fibonacci
level.  “Day-by-day we are seeing more signs that the gauge has
bottomed out,” Miyata said in a telephone interview. “It’s
very possible that the Nikkei will start testing its April high
in a pattern similar to the one we saw  last year .”  The Nikkei  gained  62 percent from its March 10 intraday low
last year to this year’s intraday high of 11,408.17 on April 5.
The gauge sank to an intraday low this year of 8,796.45 on Sept.
1, close to a support level at 8,700 -- the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement mark. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.  Three-Year Trend  A major shift in trend for the Nikkei has occurred
approximately every three years since the gauge’s high in 1989,
Miyata said. The next “turning point” should be between
September and December this year, he said, with Oct. 11, 2007
being the starting point of the latest cycle. The gauge reached
a high of 17,488.97 on that day.  Miyata also believes the yen may start weakening next month,
helping to boost the Nikkei.  The dollar-yen rate has been moving in an 11-month cycle,
touching its low when it enters a new phase, he said. The
Japanese currency rose to its highest level for 2009 when it
traded at 84.83 on Nov. 27. Taking that as a starting point, the
end of the 11-month cycle will be this month.  The yen should start to weaken significantly from next
month, with the Nov. 3 Federal Open Market Committee meeting as
a turning point, Miyata said.  “As the saying goes: buy on expectation and sell on fact.
If the U.S. does carry out quantitative easing as people
expected, there will be selling of the yen,” Miyata said.  The Fibonacci sequence was identified by Italian
mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century. The ratio
between the numbers, about 0.618, is known as the golden mean,
and is used by technical analysts to find levels of resistance
and support.  To contact the reporter on this story:
