Sovereign wealth funds worldwide
dramatically cut their investments in the first half of this
year, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a report by
Monitor Group of the U.S. and Italy’s Fondazione Eni Enrico
Mattei.  Investment for the first half of 2010 was $22 billion, a
sharp drop when compared to the last half of 2009, when it was
$58 billion, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
