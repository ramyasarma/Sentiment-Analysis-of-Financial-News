Knight Capital Group Inc. , the
largest trader of U.S. shares by volume, fell the most in seven
months after quarterly profit missed analyst estimates, as
volume slowed to the lowest level in at least two years.  Third-quarter earnings excluding $16.7 million in severance
and related charges was 11 cents a share,  missing  the average
analyst estimate of 20 cents, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Net income was $203,000, or breakeven on a per-share
basis, compared with $29.2 million a year earlier. The shares
fell as much as 5.4 percent, the most since March 15.  Knight gets most of its  revenue  from fees charged for
executing orders and making markets, depending on price
volatility and increased volume. While the company started a
bond-trading unit with a July 2008 acquisition, equities remain
the biggest contributor to commission revenue. U.S. market-wide
stock trading declined last quarter to its lowest daily average
in at least two years.  “Relative to our estimates, the miss was largely driven by
higher-than-expected execution and clearance fees, which rose as
a percentage of revenues due to lower volumes,”  Christopher Allen , a New York-based analyst with Ticonderoga Securities LLC,
wrote in a report after the release.  The  shares  fell 0.3 percent to $13.02 at 4 p.m. New York
time. They have declined 15 percent in 2010, compared with a 5.5
percent slump in the NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index that tracks
Knight and 10 rivals.  Staffing  Knight cut “close to 100 people” last quarter, Chief
Executive Officer  Thomas Joyce  said on a conference call today.
There were 1,297 full-time employees at the end of the quarter,
compared with 1,098 at the same point last year. An acquisition
in July added 109 employees, the company previously announced.  The Jersey City, New Jersey-based company shut its
convertible-bond trading desk in Greenwich, Connecticut, last
quarter because of a “lack of business,” Joyce said. He also
said that he doesn’t expect further job cuts.  “That team not being here really doesn’t affect much in
terms of our revenue,” he said. “In terms of the other
headcount, obviously we’re going to reallocate clients and
optimize that to the extent that we can.”  The restructuring will save the company $18 million
annualized, Chief Financial Officer  Steve Bisgay  said on the
call. While the dollar amount of savings is split evenly between
the equities and fixed-income divisions, more jobs were cut on
the fixed-income side, he said.  Volume, Volatility  Third-quarter revenue slid 20 percent to $239.5 million,
according to a statement today. Knight averaged 3.42 million
trades per day in U.S. equities, down 13 percent from a year
earlier.  Stock-trading  volume  across all markets slid in the third
quarter, with 7.66 billion shares changing hands each day on
average. That’s 18 percent less than the same period a year
earlier and the lowest daily average for a quarter in data
compiled by Bloomberg going back to June 2008.  More trading occurred in 2008 and 2009, when volatility
surged and the financial crisis drove the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index to the biggest annual retreat since the 1930s. The
benchmark U.S. volatility index known as the VIX, which surged
to an all-time high of 80.86 in November 2008, has fallen to
20.63. Its closing levels ranged between 32.86 and 21.21 during
the third quarter.  “Third quarter 2010 was a challenging environment,”
 Richard Repetto , a New York-based analyst with Sandler O’Neill &
Partners LP, wrote in an Oct. 8 note. “Not only were volumes
lackluster, but volatility declined steadily during the
quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
