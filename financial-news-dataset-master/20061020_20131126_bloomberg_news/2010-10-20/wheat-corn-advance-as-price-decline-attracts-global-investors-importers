Corn rose for the first time in six
days in Chicago and wheat headed for the biggest gain in eight
sessions on speculation that a weaker dollar will boost demand
from investors and importers for U.S. crops.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
 greenback ’s strength, dropped as much as 0.8 percent. It has
slid 6.6 percent since the end of August as the Federal Reserve
moves to stoke the economy. A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-
priced commodities cheaper in terms of other monies and spurs
demand for raw materials as an alternative investment.  “It’s the dollar,” said  Gary Mead , a senior commodity
analyst at VM Group in London. “We’re living in an era where
people want to have something physical, tangible, reliable that
they know is going to be in demand. Crops, more or less, are
going to be in demand as far as the eye can see.”  Corn for December delivery climbed 10.25 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $5.5625 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade after declining 5.7 percent in the past
five sessions.  Wheat for December delivery advanced 4.25 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $6.7575 a bushel. A close at that price would be the
biggest gain since the most-active contract rose by the exchange
limit of 60 cents on Oct. 8. Futures are little changed this
month after losing 4.7 percent in the past two sessions.  Egyptian Purchase  Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris climbed 50 cents, or 0.2 percent, to 210.75 euros
($292.01) a metric ton.  Egypt, the world’s biggest wheat importer, bought 290,000
tons of the grain for shipment from Dec. 21 to Dec. 31, Nomani
Nomani, vice-chairman of the state-run General Authority for
Supply Commodities, said yesterday. The purchase included two
55,000-ton cargoes of U.S. wheat.  Corn is up 12 percent this month after the U.S. government
said national output would drop 3.4 percent from a year earlier,
more than expected by analysts. Wheat futures have dropped 22
percent after surging to a 23-month high on Aug. 6, when Russia
announced it would ban all grain exports to protect domestic
supply.  Corn and wheat are seeing a “bounce following the steep
declines,”  Luke Mathews , a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, said by telephone from Sydney today.  Interest Rates  The dollar index declined after jumping 1.6 percent
yesterday as investors sought a haven on concern tighter Chinese
monetary policy may dampen economic expansion in the country and
globally. Yesterday’s increase “knocked the wind out” of
commodities, Mathews said.  China’s central bank yesterday unexpectedly raised
borrowing costs for the first time since 2007, lifting the one-
year lending and the deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point.  Russia’s harvests of all grains fell 37 percent to 61.9
million tons in so-called bunker weight as of Oct. 17 because of
drought, news service Interfax reported, citing Agriculture
Ministry data. That’s more than the 34 percent drop reported by
the Federal State Statistics Service as of Oct. 1. Russia was
the third-largest wheat grower last year.  Bunker weight is at least 6 percent more than what grain
weighs after drying and cleaning.  Russian farmers planted 12.9 million hectares (31.9 million
acres) with winter grains as of Oct. 17, down by 3.9 million
hectares from a year ago, Interfax said, citing the ministry.  Soybeans for January delivery rose for the first time in
four sessions in Chicago, gaining 14.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$12.06 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
