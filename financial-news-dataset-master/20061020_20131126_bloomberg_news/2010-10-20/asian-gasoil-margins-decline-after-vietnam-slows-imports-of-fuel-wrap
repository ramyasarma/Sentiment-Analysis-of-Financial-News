The refining profit from making
gasoil in Asia fell to the lowest in almost two weeks as
Vietnam’s fuel imports slowed and crude oil retraced some of
yesterday’s 4.3 percent decline.  The Asian  gasoil crack , a measure of processing profits
from making the industrial fuel, dropped 8 cents to $13.07 a
barrel at 10:11 a.m. Singapore time, the lowest level since Oct.
8, according to data from broker PVM Oil Associates.  Gasoil 
swaps lost 3 percent to $91.50 a barrel.  Vietnam National Petroleum Corp., known as Petrolimex,
hasn’t issued a tender to buy gasoil in the fourth quarter as
domestic stocks are “sufficient,” Vienna-based energy
consultant JBC Energy GmbH said in an Oct. 16 report.  Gasoil prices in Singapore were at a smaller discount to
European levels, making it less profitable to ship diesel
cargoes to Europe. The  East-West  gasoil spread for November
narrowed to a discount of $14 a barrel from $15.50 yesterday.  Fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed to $6.74 a
barrel from $7.42 a barrel yesterday, PVM data showed. The gap
was at $7.83 a barrel on Oct. 14, the biggest spread in more
than five months.  Swaps for fuel oil  fell 2.8 percent to $466 a
metric ton.  Open-specification naphtha cargoes delivered in the first
half of December were bid at $751 a ton against offers at $754,
data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte showed. Second-half
December lots were bid at $749 a ton to offers at $752 a ton.  Prices of  naphtha  for delivery in December were at $768.88
a ton yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The profit from making ethylene out of naphtha may be
capped in Asia next year after Chinese production jumped to the
highest level in eight months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
