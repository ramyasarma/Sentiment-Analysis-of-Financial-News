French day-ahead power  jumped to its
highest price since January 2009 as strikers in France cut
capacity at Electricite de France SA’s nuclear reactors.  Electricity for delivery tomorrow in Europe’s second-
biggest market rose as much as 22.50 euros, or 31 percent, to 95
euros ($131) a megawatt-hour and traded at 91 euros at 10:37
a.m. Paris time, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Striking workers at Electricite de France SA nuclear power
plants cut output by about 3,000 megawatts, CGT Union
spokeswoman  Marie-Claire Cailletaud  said yesterday. Workers are
on strike as part of a national protest that paralyzed ports and
refineries over a government plan to raise the retirement age.  To contact the reporter on this story:
