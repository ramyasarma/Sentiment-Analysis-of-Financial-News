A British aid worker kidnapped in
Somalia has been freed by his captors and is safe, said Kathryn
Rawe, a spokeswoman for his employer, U.K.-based  Save the
Children .  Zimbabwe-born Frans Barnard was seized by unknown abductors
on Oct. 14 in Adado, a town near the Ethiopian border. He had
been studying the possibility of setting up programs to help
sick and malnourished children in the area, Rawe said today in a
phone interview from London. Senior community leaders helped
negotiate his release and no ransom was paid, she said.  “He is back in safe hands at the moment” in Somalia, Rawe
said, without providing further details.  Somalia’s Western-backed government has been battling
insurgents including al-Shabaab, which has pledged allegiance to
al-Qaeda, since 2007. Most of the south and center of Somalia
has been seized by the rebel militia. President  Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed ’s administration controls only portions of the
capital, Mogadishu, supported by the almost 7,000-strong African
Union force of mainly Ugandan and Burundian soldiers.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ousting of former dictator  Mohamed Siad Barre  in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
