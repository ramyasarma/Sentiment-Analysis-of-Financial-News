Santos Ltd. , Australia’s third-
largest oil and gas producer, said third-quarter sales dropped 4
percent as output fell. Production from the  Exxon Mobil Corp .-
operated Kipper gas project has been delayed.  Sales declined to A$535 million ($525 million) in the three
months ended Sept. 30, Santos said in a statement to the stock
exchange today. Production slipped 9 percent from a year earlier
to 12.9 million barrels of oil equivalent after flooding in
Australia’s Cooper Basin disrupted rig operations.  Kipper , off the southeast coast of Australia, where Santos
owns a 35 percent stake, is now expected to start producing gas
in the first half of 2012, as opposed to next year, the
Adelaide-based company said. Exxon is developing the Turrum and
Kipper projects in the Bass Strait together, at an estimated
cost of almost A$3 billion. Exxon owns 32.5 percent of the
venture and  BHP Billiton Ltd.  the remaining 32.5 percent.  A design review at the Turrum venture, now nearing
completion, will likely have “schedule impacts,” for Kipper,
Santos said. The shares dropped 0.2 percent to A$12.43 at 12:31
p.m. in Sydney, compared with a 0.5 percent advance in the
benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index .  Santos maintained its 2010 production guidance at 49
million to 52 million barrels of oil equivalent. It cut
projected spending to A$2 billion from A$2.3 billion, reflecting
the timing of investment at an Exxon-led $15 billion Papua New
Guinea liquefied natural gas venture.  Santos trails BHP and  Woodside Petroleum Ltd.  among
Australian oil and gas producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
