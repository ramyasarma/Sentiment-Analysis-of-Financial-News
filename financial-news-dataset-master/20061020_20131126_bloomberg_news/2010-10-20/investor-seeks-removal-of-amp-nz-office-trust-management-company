Accident Compensation Corp.  is
seeking removal of the manager of  AMP NZ Office Trust , New
Zealand’s third-biggest publicly traded real estate investor,
citing poor performance and high fees.  ACC, which owns 8.9 percent of AMP Office, plans to call
for a meeting of unitholders to recommend the trustee remove
AMP Haumi Management Ltd., the Wellington-based investor said in
an e-mailed statement.  AMP Office shareholders will vote today on a change in
structure to a company from a trust, effectively locking in AMP
Haumi as manager, according to ACC. Under the Unit Trusts Act
1960, a manager may be removed from office if the trustee
certifies it is in the best interests of shareholders.  “AMP Haumi has not only performed poorly but has also
imposed unreasonable fees on unitholders,” said ACC investment
manager  Nicholas Bagnall  in the statement. “The investment
decisions and capital management decisions made have
unquestionably resulted in a loss of value.”  If AMP Office had “continued to own the buildings it owned
10 years ago”, without acquisitions or capital raising, each
unit would have a net asset value of NZ$1.15 (87 cents), Bagnall
said. AMP Haumi’s decisions had seen net asset value fall to $1
per unit, he said.  AMP Office’s manager agreed yesterday to reduce fees if the
change in structure is approved. The management fee will change
to 0.55 percent of the value of investment properties up to NZ$1
billion, 0.45 percent up to NZ$1.5 billion and 0.35 percent
above that level, AMP Office said in a statement.  To contact the reporter for this story:
