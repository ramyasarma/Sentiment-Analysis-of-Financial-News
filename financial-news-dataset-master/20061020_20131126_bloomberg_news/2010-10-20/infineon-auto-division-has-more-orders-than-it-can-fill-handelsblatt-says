Infineon Technologies AG , Europe’s
second-biggest chipmaker, can’t satisfy all orders at its car
division as demand has been rising strongly,  Handelsblatt 
reported today, citing Jochen Hanebeck, the unit’s chief.  The company expects demand and capacity to be balanced at
the end of the year and aims to increase the division’s sales by
more than 15 percent in 2011, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
