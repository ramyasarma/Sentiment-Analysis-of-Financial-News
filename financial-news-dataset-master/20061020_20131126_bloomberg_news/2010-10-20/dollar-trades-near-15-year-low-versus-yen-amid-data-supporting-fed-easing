The dollar was close to a 15-year
low against the yen ahead of economic data that may add to the
case for more monetary easing by the Federal Reserve that will
debase the currency.  The dollar slipped from a two-week high versus the euro
before a report forecast to show a gauge of leading indicators
failed to accelerate last month. A Fed regional survey released
yesterday showed the economy expanded in September at a “modest
pace.” The Australian dollar traded within two U.S. cents of
parity with the greenback as gains in equities and commodities
spurred demand for growth-sensitive currencies.  “People certainly expect the Fed to do some kind of
additional easing in November,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, senior
strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co. in Tokyo. “They will
maintain their policy easing for a while, not just a short
period.”  The dollar was unchanged at 81.09 yen at 8:48 a.m. in
Tokyo. It touched 80.85 yesterday, the weakest since April 1995,
when the post-World War II low of 79.75 was set. The dollar was
unchanged at $1.3964 per euro, after touching $1.3698 yesterday,
the strongest since Oct. 5. The yen was little changed at 113.25
per euro.  The  Dollar Index , used by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to
track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, fell 1.3 percent to 77.17 yesterday.  The Conference Board’s index of leading indicators rose 0.3
percent in September, the same pace as in August, according to
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before the New York-based group reports the data.  Beige Book  The Fed said yesterday in its Beige Book business survey by
the 12 regional banks that 8 of them, including San Francisco
and Chicago, reported some form of growth. The Philadelphia and
Richmond Feds said their economies were “mixed” while the
Cleveland region “held steady” and the Atlanta district
“remained slow.”  Interest-rate futures contracts on the Chicago Board of
Trade showed a 33 percent chance U.S. policy makers would cut
the target lending rate to zero by January. The probability was
25 percent a month ago. The key U.S. rate has been at a range of
zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  of shares rose 1.1 percent
yesterday in New York. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials gained 2.1 percent.  China’s Economy  China’s gross domestic product expanded 9.5 percent in the
third quarter from a year ago after growing 10.3 percent in the
second quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists
before today’s data. The nation’s consumer prices are expected
to gain 3.6 percent in September from a year ago.  China increased its benchmark lending and deposit rates on
Oct. 19 after inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in 22
months. The one-year deposit rate will climb to 2.5 percent from
2.25 percent, the People’s Bank of China said on its website.  “China raised interest rates before the GPD data, which
implies to me that the number may be strong,” said Kengo
Suzuki, foreign-exchange analyst at Mizuho Securities Co. in
Tokyo. “Money is likely to flow into higher-yielding and
commodity currencies."  Australia’s dollar was at 98.67 U.S. cents from 98.71
cents. It reached parity with the greenback on Oct. 15 for the
first time since exchange controls were removed in 1983. The so-
called Aussie fetched 80.02 yen from 80.04 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
