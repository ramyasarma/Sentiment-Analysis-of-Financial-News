European stocks fluctuated, paring
earlier losses, as gains by Novo Nordisk A/S and BIC SA offset
declines by Taylor Wimpey Plc and Elan Corp.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed,
adding 0.1 percent to 265.53 at 10:01 a.m. in London, after
earlier falling as much as 0.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
