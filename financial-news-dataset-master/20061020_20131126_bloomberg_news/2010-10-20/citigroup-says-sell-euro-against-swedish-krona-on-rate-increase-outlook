Investors should sell the euro
against the Swedish krona on expectations the Riksbank will
raise its key interest rate, according to Citigroup Inc.  The euro may weaken to 9.1 krona,  Valentin Marinov , a
London-based currency strategist at Citigroup, wrote in a
research report today.  “The krona could be well positioned to regain ground
against the euro ahead of the Riksbank rate decision next
week,” Marinov said. “The drop we expect will bring euro-krona
more in line with its fundamentals.”  The Riksbank is likely to raise its benchmark rate by 25
basis points to 1 percent, according to Citigroup.  The euro fell 0.6 percent to 9.2908 krona as of 5:43 p.m.
