Asian currencies weakened after
China’s first interest-rate increase since 2007 dimmed the
outlook for spending in the No. 1 export market for South Korea,
Taiwan and Thailand.  China’s yuan dropped the most in a eight weeks on
speculation the rate rise will alleviate the need for policy
makers to use currency appreciation to contain inflation.
Malaysia’s ringgit and the Singapore dollar led regional
declines, having last week touched their strongest levels in at
least 13 years.  “This is mainly a knee-jerk reaction to concerns that
tighter Chinese policy would slow China’s growth and reduce
upward pressure on Asian currencies,” said  Brian Jackson , an
emerging-markets strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.
“Also, positioning in Asian currencies has been fairly heavy in
recent weeks. But we think it’s overdone and the move will be
short-lived.”  The yuan weakened 0.1 percent to 6.6515 per dollar as of
5:16 p.m. in Shanghai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The ringgit declined 0.3 percent to 3.1175, the Singapore dollar
fell 0.3 percent to S$1.3079 and the Thai baht dropped 0.1
percent to 29.92. The Philippine peso retreated 0.2 percent to
43.455.  China’s central bank yesterday lifted its benchmark one-
year lending and deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage
point to 5.56 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. Government
data tomorrow will show consumer prices rose 3.6 percent in
September, the most in nearly two years, and gross domestic
product climbed 9.5 percent in the third quarter, according to
the median forecasts of economists in separate Bloomberg surveys.  Won Bucks Trend  “The rate hikes show China won’t just rely on raising the
yuan to damp inflation,” said  Gerrard Katz , the Hong-Kong based
head of foreign-exchange trading at Standard Chartered Plc.  South Korea’s won gained, bucking the regional trend, on
speculation exporters took the opportunity of earlier declines
to convert foreign earnings. The currency rose 0.3 percent to
1,126.95 per dollar. It earlier lost as much as 1.1 percent to
reach 1,142.95, the lowest level since Sept. 29.  “Exporters were selling dollars,” Katz said. “We saw an
overreaction to China’s rate hike earlier.”  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 8,938
and Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.1 percent to NT$30.93.  To contact the reporter on this story:
