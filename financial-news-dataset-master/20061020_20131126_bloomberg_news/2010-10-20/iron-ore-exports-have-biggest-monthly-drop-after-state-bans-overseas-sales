India’s iron ore exports fell 47
percent in September, the biggest monthly decline this financial
year, after the southern state of Karnataka banned overseas
sales of the steelmaking raw material.  Shipments fell to 3 million metric tons last month from
about 5.8 million tons a year earlier, the  Federation of Indian
Mineral Industries  said today in an e-mailed statement. Exports
from Mormugao, Vishakhapatnam, Krishnapatnam and Paradip, the
four biggest iron ore ports, fell 34 percent to 2.3 million tons
last month, it said.  Iron ore shipments from India, the world’s third-largest
exporter, may fall as much as 38 percent this fiscal year
because of higher taxes and freight charges, and the Karnataka
ban,  Federation of Indian Mineral Industries  President Siddharth
Rungta said in August. India raised the export tax on iron ore
lumps to 15 percent in April from 10 percent after introducing a
5 percent tax on iron ore fines in December.  The Karnataka High Court is likely to uphold by the end of
the month a petition by mining companies to end the ban imposed
on July 26, Sesa Goa Ltd. Managing Director  P.K. Mukherjee  said
yesterday in a conference call. A lifting of the ban will
benefit  Sesa Goa  and  NMDC Ltd. , India’s biggest producers of
iron ore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
