Abu Dhabi shares fell the most in
more than two months, helping lead Persian Gulf markets lower,
after China unexpectedly raised interest rates, stoking concern
policy tightening may slow the global economic recovery.  Emirates Telecommunications Corp. , the largest phone
company in the United Arab Emirates, retreated 2.1 percent after
third-quarter profit dropped 23 percent.  Abu Dhabi Commercial
Bank PJSC  slipped for a third day this week. The  ADX General
Index  retreated 0.8 percent, the most since Aug. 12, to 2,786.49
at the 2 p.m. close in Abu Dhabi. The  DFM General Index  rose 0.6
percent, reversing an earlier loss. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index 
dropped 0.6 percent.  “A paucity of any local drivers means the MENA remained
hitched to global markets,” said  Julian Bruce , director of
equity sales at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai.  Asian stocks fell after China yesterday raised borrowing
costs for the first time since 2007 as policy makers try to curb
lending and prevent asset-price bubbles. The  MSCI Asia Pacific
Index  of regional shares declined as much as 1.2 percent. U.S.
stocks tumbled yesterday amid concern banks will be forced to
buy back soured mortgages. The  S&P 500 Index  lost 1.6 percent,
the biggest slide since Aug. 19.  Etisalat retreated the most since July 28 to 11.6 dirhams.
The company said third-quarter profit dropped to 1.74 billion
dirhams ($473 million) from 2.25 billion dirhams the year
earlier after operating expenses rose. Abu Dhabi Commercial, the
third-largest lender in the U.A.E. by assets, fell 1.2 percent,
the most since Oct. 17, to 2.42 dirhams.  Rally Falters  Dubai’s benchmark stock index advanced the most since Oct.
13 after earlier dropping as much as 1.2 percent.  Dubai Islamic
Bank PJSC,  the biggest Shariah-compliant lender in the U.A.E.,
led the advance, surged 5.1 percent, the biggest gain since
March 25, to 2.46 dirhams.  Dubai Islamic may announce earnings next week.  Abu Dhabi
Islamic Bank PJSC,  the U.A.E.’s second-biggest bank complying
with Muslim banking principles, yesterday jumped 3.9 percent
after third-quarter profit increased 31 percent.  The rally in Dubai’s market was driven predominantly by
“retail flow in DIB today, and the thought process probably
runs along the lines of - if ADIB reports good numbers then DIB
most likely will too,” EFG’s Bruce said.  Qatar’s  index  lost 1.3 percent, the most since June 2 and
Oman’s  MSM30 Index  retreated 0.3 percent. Bahrain’s  gauge  was
little changed. The  Kuwait SE Price Index  dropped 0.3 percent
and Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  fell 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
