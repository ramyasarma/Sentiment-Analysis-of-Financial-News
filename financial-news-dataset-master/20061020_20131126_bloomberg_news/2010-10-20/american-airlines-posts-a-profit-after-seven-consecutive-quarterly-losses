American Airlines parent  AMR Corp. 
reported third-quarter profit of $143 million as a rebound in
demand and higher fares helped end seven consecutive quarterly
losses.  Net income was 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$359 million, or $1.26, a year earlier, the Fort Worth, Texas-
based carrier said today in a statement. The results beat the
32-cent average of 13 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  A resurgence of business travelers, who generally pay
higher fares, helped push  AMR  to its first profit since the
third quarter of 2008. American’s passenger traffic rose 3.7
percent while its average fare per mile increased 11 percent.  “Our results show significant improvement in revenue and
reflect our continued dedication to controlling costs,” Chief
Executive Officer  Gerard Arpey  said in the statement.  Sales  rose 14 percent to $5.84 billion.  American is the third major U.S. carrier to report results
today, joining Delta Air Lines Inc. and US Airways Group Inc. in
announcing profits that exceeded analysts’ estimates. Increased
demand and higher fares are expected to result in a combined
profit of as much as $2.4 billion for the eight largest
carriers, according to  Michael Derchin , an analyst at CRT
Capital Group LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
