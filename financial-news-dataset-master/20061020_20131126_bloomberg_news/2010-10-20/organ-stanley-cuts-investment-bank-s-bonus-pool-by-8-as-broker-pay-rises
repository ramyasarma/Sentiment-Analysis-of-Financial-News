Morgan Stanley , owner of the world’s
largest brokerage, cut the investment bank’s bonus pool 8
percent this year, making it smaller than the money reserved to
pay brokers, who produced less revenue.  Pay at the firm’s institutional securities unit, which
includes traders and bankers, dropped to $5.3 billion in the
year’s first nine months as revenue there rose 32 percent to
$12.7 billion, according to its  website . Compensation at the
brokerage unit, which expanded through a joint venture with
 Citigroup Inc. ’s Smith Barney last year, climbed 41 percent to
$5.8 billion, or 63 percent of its $9.3 billion revenue.  Brokers “are on a much more fixed formula for compensation
typically,” said  Rose Marie Orens , senior partner at New
York-based Compensation Advisory Partners. The investment bank
“has a lot more discretion over how much gets paid out.”  James Gorman , who became Morgan Stanley’s chief executive
officer after overseeing the brokerage division, has promised to
reduce the portion of the company’s overall revenue awarded in
compensation after it surged to 62 percent last year. In the
first nine months, Morgan Stanley reserved 50 percent of firm-
wide revenue to pay employees, down from 64 percent a year ago.  The company set aside $12 billion for compensation and
benefits in the nine-month period, up 12 percent from a year
earlier, as revenue surged 43 percent, according to its website.  The firm-wide compensation is enough to pay each of its
62,864 employees $190,681 for nine month’s work, up from
$175,543 for each of the 60,800 employees at the end of the same
period in 2009. The New York-based bank doesn’t report
headcounts for its three divisions.  Preparing for Bonuses  Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year for employees, awarding most of the money as
year-end bonuses. Morgan Stanley reserved $3.7 billion for
compensation in the third quarter, or 54 percent of revenue,
greater than the 49 percent set aside in the first half.  The brokerage division, which the company calls global
wealth management, generated 49 percent more revenue in the
first nine months of this year compared with last year. Part of
the reason is that Morgan Stanley had control of Smith Barney
for only about four months at this point last year.  Orens said guarantees paid to Smith Barney brokers and
other new hires will increase the unit’s compensation costs
temporarily. “It’s a short term issue here because they made a
decision to diversify their business,” she said.  Asset-management compensation climbed 6 percent to $842
million in the first nine months of the year as revenue more
than doubled to $1.87 billion.  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Morgan Stanley’s larger rival,
said yesterday that it set aside $13.1 billion, or 43 percent of
revenue, for compensation and benefits in the first nine months
of the year. That’s down 21 percent from a year earlier, when it
reserved 47 percent in the same period before slashing
compensation costs in the fourth quarter.  Last week, New York-based  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  said it
allocated 39 percent of its investment bank’s revenue to pay
workers in the division for the first nine months of the year,
up from 38 percent a year earlier.  The unit’s compensation expense fell 10 percent to $7.88
billion from $8.79 billion. That’s equal to $298,866 for each of
its 26,373 workers at the end of September, down from $353,834
on average for the division’s 24,828 employees a year earlier.  Goldman Sachs’s pool is enough to pay each of the New York-
based firm’s 35,400  employees  $370,706 for nine months’ work.
That’s down from an average $527,192 for the company’s 31,700
workers a year earlier.  Bigger Bonuses Expected  Average pay per worker doesn’t reflect the amount of money
employees actually receive. Top executives and revenue producers
sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards, while clerical
staff get much smaller salaries.  About 71 percent of 2,145 people who responded to an
eFinancialCareers.com e-mailed poll in the U.S. said they are
anticipating at least an equal bonus from last year, with 50
percent expecting a bigger payout. About 11 percent said their
bonus will jump by at least half, according to the survey
released earlier this month.  The following compares compensation at Morgan Stanley with
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan’s investment bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
