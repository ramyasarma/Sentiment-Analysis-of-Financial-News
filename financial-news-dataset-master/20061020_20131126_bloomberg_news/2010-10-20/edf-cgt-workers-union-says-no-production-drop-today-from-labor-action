Labor action at Electricite de
France SA today is ‘limited’ and hasn’t led to any drop in
output, according to a CGT representative.  Speaking by telephone, Marie-Claire Cailletaud said nuclear
output dropped by 3,000 megawatts yesterday while production
from thermal plants fell by 2,000 megawatts as workers
participated in a national strike against a government plan to
raise the retirement age.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
