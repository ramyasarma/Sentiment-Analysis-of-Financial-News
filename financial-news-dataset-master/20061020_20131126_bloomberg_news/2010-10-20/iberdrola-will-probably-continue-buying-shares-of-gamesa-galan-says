Iberdrola SA, Spain’s biggest
utility, said it will “probably” continue buying shares in
wind turbine manufacturer Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA.  “We think the stock is cheap,” Chief Executive Jose
Ignacio Sanchez Galan said on a conference call today. “We have
bought it and we will very probably continue buying.”  Iberdrola on Oct. 18 said it increased its stake in
Gamesa to 15.057 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
