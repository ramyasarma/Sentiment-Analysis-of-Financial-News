Vedanta Resources Plc ’s $8.5 billion
aluminum expansion plan in India is in “serious” breach of
forestry laws and a decision on the project may be taken as
early as tomorrow, the Environment Ministry said.  “There have been serious violations,” Minister  Jairam Ramesh  said today in an interview at his New Delhi office.
“There have also been some procedural violations in its
existing refinery,” he said, referring to the 1 million metric
ton facility at Lanjigarh in eastern Orissa state.  Vedanta, controlled by billionaire  Anil Agarwal , won
approval from the Orissa government in August to implement a 375
billion rupee ($8.5 billion) expansion of its Lanjigarh alumina
refinery. The Environment Ministry said in August Vedanta’s
existing refinery may be sourcing bauxite from mines without
environmental approvals and asked Vedanta to justify why the
permit for the refinery should not be canceled.  The company has replied to the ministry, said  Mukesh Kumar ,
chief operating officer of Vedanta Aluminium Ltd., the company’s
Indian unit. A notice may be sent to the company as early as
tomorrow, Ramesh said today.  Vedanta will cut its investments by as much as $2 billion
in the next two years after failing to get clearance to mine
bauxite at the Niyamgiri hills in the state, Chief Executive
Officer  Mahendra Singh Mehta  said Oct. 7. The capital
expenditure revision “will have an impact of between $1.5
billion and $2 billion,” Mehta said, clarifying the numbers
were tentative.  To contact the reporters on this story:
