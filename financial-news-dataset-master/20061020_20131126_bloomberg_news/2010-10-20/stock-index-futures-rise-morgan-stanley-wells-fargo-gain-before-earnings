U.S.  stocks  advanced, with benchmark
indexes rallying the most in two weeks, on higher-than-estimated
results at  Boeing Co.  and  Yahoo! Inc.  and speculation the
Federal Reserve will inject more money into the economy.  Boeing climbed 3.4 percent after also raising its full-year
earnings projections. Yahoo! rose 2 percent after third-quarter
profit beat analysts’ estimates.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc.  added 2.8 percent, leading a  measure  of raw-materials
producers to the biggest gain among 10 industries in the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index .  The  S&P 500  rose 1.1 percent to 1,178.17 at 4 p.m. in New
York, maintaining gains after the Fed said in its Beige Book
business survey that U.S. economic growth showed little sign of
acceleration last month, fueling speculation it will boost
purchases of government debt. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
increased 129.35 points, or 1.2 percent, to 11,107.97.  “The Beige Book reiterates the call for quantitative
easing,” said  Jack Ablin , chief investment officer at Chicago-
based Harris Private Bank, which oversees $55 billion. “The
economy is growing, just not accelerating. It remains to be seen
what ultimately the Fed buying of bonds will do. For now, we get
stock investors reacting positively to that.”  The  S&P 500  dropped the most since August yesterday as
Apple Inc. forecast profit that fell short of predictions, China
raised interest rates and after people familiar with the matter
said bondholders are seeking to make Bank of America Corp.
repurchase soured mortgages that were packaged into $47 billion
of bonds.  Fed Bets  The S&P 500 has climbed 3.2 percent this month, following
an 8.8 percent September rally, as Fed policy makers indicated a
readiness to pump more cash into the economy to protect the
recovery by buying Treasury securities, a tactic known as
quantitative easing.  “Companies are for the most part beating their numbers
this earnings season,” said  Scott Armiger , who helps manage
about $5.6 billion at Christiana Bank & Trust in Greenville,
Delaware. “We’re back to the trend of a weaker dollar on the
expectation that the Fed is going to initiate a second round of
quantitative easing.”  The dollar slid the most against the euro since July and
touched a 15-year low versus the yen amid speculation the Fed
will ease monetary policy. The economy showed expanded at a
“modest” pace in September and early October and companies are
still hesitant to hire, the Fed said in its regional business
survey today.  ‘Positive Run’  Per-share earnings have topped estimates at 62 of the 74
companies in the S&P 500 that reported results since Oct. 7,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income has grown 54
percent for the group as sales increased 6.7 percent.  “Notwithstanding the likes of Apple and IBM, yesterday
continued the positive run of earnings we have seen so far this
reporting season,”  Gary Jenkins , head of fixed income at
Evolution Securities Ltd. in London, wrote in a note.  Boeing, the largest aerospace company, climbed 3.4 percent
to $71.36. Net income was $837 million, or $1.12 a share,
compared with a net loss of $1.56 billion, or $2.23, a year
earlier. Profit beat the average analyst estimate of $1.07 as
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 1.7 percent to $17 billion,
exceeding analysts’ $16.8 billion prediction. Boeing shipped
more 737s, as well as 777s, after receiving replacements for
faulty seats, bolstering revenue from airlines.  Yahoo!, Freeport  Yahoo! Inc.  added 2 percent to $15.80. The most-visited
U.S. Web portal late yesterday said third-quarter net income
more than doubled to $396.1 million, or 29 cents a share. Yahoo
gained 13 cents a share from the sale of its HotJobs site and
had a 4-cent benefit a year earlier from an investment in
Alibaba.com. Analysts had estimated 15 cents on average,
according to Bloomberg data.  The company predicted fourth-quarter sales of $1.13 billion
to $1.23 billion. Analysts had estimated sales of $1.25 billion.  Monster Worldwide Inc. , the world’s largest online
recruiting company, rose the most in the S&P 500, gaining 6.5
percent to $13.87. Rival Manpower Inc. reported third quarter
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates and its shares increased
3.5 percent to $56.76.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the world’s biggest
publicly traded copper producer, advanced 2.8 percent to $95.35,
leading a  materials  gauge in the S&P 500 to a 2 percent gain.
 DuPont Co. , the third-largest U.S. chemical maker, increased 2.4
percent to $47.08 for the second-biggest gain in the Dow.  Demand for Commodities  “Materials producers are fueled by movements in the dollar
and China’s decision to raise interest rates,” said  Caesar Bryan , who manages $730 million in the GAMCO Gold Fund Inc.
“The Chinese wouldn’t be raising rates if growth was very weak,
so the move may be confirmation that there will be continuing
demand for many of these commodities.”  Boston Scientific Corp. jumped the second-most in the S&P
500, rallying 5.5 percent to $6.30. The second-biggest heart-
device maker by revenue reported a third-quarter profit as sales
of its key heart-rhythm devices matched the upper range of
analysts’ estimates.  Wells Fargo & Co.  gained 4.3 percent to $25.60, leading a
rebound in a measure of financial companies in the S&P 500,
which rose 1.1 percent. The largest U.S. home lender reported
record third-quarter profit of 60 cents a diluted share as
credit conditions improved and said it’s “eager” to return
capital to shareholders.  Analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg
estimated profit of 56 cents.  Delta, Lilly  Delta Air Lines Inc.  jumped 11 percent to $12.97. The
world’s second-largest airline and the first of the major U.S.
carriers to release results posted a profit excluding certain
costs of $1.10 a share, beating the 94-cent average of 13
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg, as demand boosted fare prices.  Eli Lilly & Co. dropped 3.8 percent to $36.01 as the
drugmaker, along with partners Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. and
Alkermes Inc., failed to win approval for the second time from
U.S. regulators for a once-weekly version of the injectable
diabetes drug Byetta.  J. Crew Group Inc. fell 5.1 percent to $33.12. Needham &
Co. cut third and fourth quarter profit estimates for the U.S.
clothing retailer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
