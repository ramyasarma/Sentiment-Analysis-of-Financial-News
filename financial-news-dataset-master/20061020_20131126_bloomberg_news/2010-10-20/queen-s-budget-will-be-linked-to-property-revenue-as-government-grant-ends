Future payments to  Queen Elizabeth II  to run the British monarchy will be based on rents from shops
on London’s Regent Street, offices and agricultural land, rather
than being made as a direct grant from the government.  The current system for financing the monarchy, known as the
Civil List, will end in 2013, when it will be replaced by a
“sovereign support grant linked to the revenue of the  Crown
Estate ,” Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  told
lawmakers today. Osborne  announced  the biggest cuts in
government spending since World War II to help narrow the U.K.’s
 record budget deficit .  Civil List payments will be frozen at this year’s level of
30 million pounds ($48 million) until 2013. Total royal
household spending will fall 14 percent in the year to April
2013, Osborne said. The government will make a one-time
additional payment of 1 million pounds in 2012 to pay for
celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the queen’s
accession to the throne.  The Crown Estate manages real estate originating from
ancestral land and property holdings exchanged by the monarchy
in 1760 in return for annual cash payments. Its single biggest
asset is the freehold of Regent Street, which was built as a
dedicated shopping street in 1825 dividing Mayfair to the west
and Soho to the east. Valued at 1.6 billion pounds at March 31,
tenants include Apple Inc., Hamleys Plc and Burberry Group Plc.  The Treasury didn’t provide further details of how the new
payments will be calculated.  Asset Breakdown  The Crown Estate had assets totaling 6.6 billion pounds,
including real-estate assets of 6 billion pounds, at March 31,
according to its  annual report . It made a surplus of 210.7
million pounds in the fiscal year through March on revenue of
340.6 million pounds, of which 210 million pounds was passed to
the government.  In total it owns 4.2 million square feet (390,000 square
meters) of retail space and 10.6 million square feet of offices.
The Crown Estate said this month it is planning to sell its four
London housing projects to the Peabody Housing Association.  The Crown Estate also owns virtually all the seabed around
the U.K. coast out to the 12-mile territorial limit and is
leasing some of the seabed to offshore wind-farm developers. The
queen’s property manager also owns 107,000 hectares (265,000
acres) of farmland and 11,000 hectares of forestry, making it
one of the U.K.’s largest agricultural landlords.  The 1956 and 1961 Crown Estate Acts prohibit it from
borrowing or investing in anything other than U.K. property and
government bonds. Any profit from asset sales is reinvested and
net rental income generated by the properties passes directly to
the U.K. Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
