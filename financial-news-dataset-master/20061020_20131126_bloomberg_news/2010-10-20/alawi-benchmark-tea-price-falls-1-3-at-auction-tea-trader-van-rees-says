The benchmark price of tea in
Malawi, Africa’s largest producer of the crop after Kenya,
dropped 1.3 percent at an auction compared with a sale two weeks
earlier, according to Van Rees BV.  The top grade of tea, known as pekoe fannings, fetched
$2.26 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) at a sale in the commercial
capital, Blantyre, on Oct. 19 compared with $2.29 two weeks ago,
Van Rees, a tea-trading unit of Netherlands-based NIBC Principal
Investments, said an e-mailed report today.  “Demand for the leaf slightly improved but prices remained
low,”  Emmanuel Phiri , a manager at Van Rees, said in a
telephone interview from Blantyre today. “We expect prices to
improve when weekly sales begin next month.”  Supplies decreased 26 percent to 260,520 kilograms compared
with two weeks earlier while revenue dropped 21 percent to
$425,532, Van Rees said.  Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign-exchange earner
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from Malawi,
followed by South Africa and Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
