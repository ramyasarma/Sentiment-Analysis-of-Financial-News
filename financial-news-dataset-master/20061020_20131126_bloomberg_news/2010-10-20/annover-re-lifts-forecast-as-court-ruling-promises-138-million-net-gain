Hannover Re , Germany’s second-
biggest reinsurer, said it expects a gain of 100 million euros
($138 million) in the third quarter following a court ruling on
tax provisions.  A decision by the German Federal Fiscal Court allows the
reinsurer to release tax provisions set aside for a subsidiary
in Ireland, “thereby boosting net income in the third quarter
and in the full financial year,” the Hanover, Germany-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Hannover Re, led by Chief Executive Officer  Ulrich Wallin ,
reiterated the 2010 earnings target in August after quarterly
profit fell 24 percent on lower investment income, saying the
company plans to reach net income of 600 million euros. The
reinsurer is scheduled to report third-quarter results Nov. 10.  While Hannover Re anticipates a “positive effect” on
full-year earnings, it hasn’t adjusted its target as details of
the court ruling aren’t known yet, said  Gabriele Handrick , a
spokeswoman for the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
