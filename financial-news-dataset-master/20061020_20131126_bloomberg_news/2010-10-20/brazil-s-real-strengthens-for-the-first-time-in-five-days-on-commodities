Brazil’s real gained for the first
time in five days as investors increased demand for higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets and commodity prices increased.  The real rose 0.3 percent to 1.6775 per dollar at 4:27 p.m.
New York time, from 1.6827 yesterday.  “Generally we’ve had a bounce back in risk appetite, the
dollar retracing a good portion of yesterday’s gains and
commodity prices on the back of that going higher,” said  Nick Chamie , head of emerging-markets research at RBC Capital Markets
in Toronto, in a phone interview.  Raw sugar rose 1.7 percent to 28.81 cents a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Oil rose 2.9 percent to $81.77 per
barrel.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 1.1 percent.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 fell 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
11.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
