BNP Paribas  Clean Energy Partners GP
obtained a 93.5 million-euro ($129 million) loan to build a
photovoltaic power plant in Montalto di Castro, Italy.  The loan from Deutsche Bank AG, Rabobank Groep and
Centrobanca SpA will finance the 30-megawatt facility built by
Megasol SA, the company said in an e-mailed press release. The
first section of the solar plant is due to begin generating
power this year and the remainder in the first quarter of 2011.  “This project continues our strategy of creating a high-
quality portfolio of assets in Italy, and of solar assets in
general,”  Joost Bergsma , chief executive officer of the fund,
said in the statement. “Italy is a very attractive renewables
market for financial investors because of its high levels of
solar irradiation” that can be converted into power.  Bergsma, in an interview this month, said he aims to
acquire 100 megawatts of Italian solar capacity for the fund
that may control as much as 350 million euros by the time it
completes raising funds on Oct. 31. He said the fund has
targeted a 15 percent annual return for its investors.  Italian lawmakers in July agreed to lower the subsidized
price for solar power by 20 percent to 25 percent, less than
analysts expected, raising demand for panels.  Solar-project developers may add at least 2,140 megawatts
in 2011 to give Italy an installed solar base of 4,600 megawatts
by year-end, Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst  Francesco D’Avack  forecast. The surge in building may attract developers
that will look to sell their solar assets to long-term
investors, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
