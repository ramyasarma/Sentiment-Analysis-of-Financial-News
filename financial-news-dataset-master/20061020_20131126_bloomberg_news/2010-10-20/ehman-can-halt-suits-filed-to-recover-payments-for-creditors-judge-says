Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , the
investment bank in bankruptcy, can halt dozens of lawsuits it
filed against banks and investors to recover payments as part of
its effort to recover money for creditors.  Judge  James Peck  of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan
approved Lehman’s request to stay the lawsuits while it
negotiates with defendants, a group includes  Bank of America
Corp.  and  Deutsche Bank AG  as trustees for investors.  “I am satisfied that a stay is absolutely desirable here
and in the best interest of all parties,” he said.  Lehman filed about 50 lawsuits, known as avoidance actions,
to meet a statute of limitations for bringing the complaints and
preserve its claims, according to court papers. It has
agreements that could lead to lawsuits against additional
defendants. More than 1,000 parties are potentially involved,
 Harvey Miller , Lehman’s bankruptcy attorney told Peck at today’s
hearing.  Lehman won approval to halt the lawsuits so it can avoid
the costs of litigation. The stay applies to cases that have
been filed and future cases, according to court papers. Several
of the defendants named in the lawsuits filed objections, and
Peck imposed a nine-month period for the stay.  The case is In re: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., No 08-
13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
