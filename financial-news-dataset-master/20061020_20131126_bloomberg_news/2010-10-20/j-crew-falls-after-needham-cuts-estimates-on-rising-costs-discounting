J. Crew Group Inc.  fell the most
since August in New York trading after Needham & Co. cut profit
estimates for the clothing retailer, saying increased promotions
will lower earnings.  “The fall season has been difficult, due to warmer weather
trends, increased promotional environment at the competition
and a lack of dramatic fashion newness,”  Christine Chen , a
Needham analyst in San Francisco, wrote in a note to clients
today. Second-half profit margins will be under pressure as the
New York-based company increases promotions, she said.  Needham trimmed its profit estimates for the year that ends
Jan. 31 to $2.25 a share, from $2.36, and for the following year
to $2.48, from $2.54.  Earnings estimates  for the current and
next quarters were reduced as well. Improved fashion and
discounting at competitors also put pressure on J. Crew’s
prices, said Chen, who recommends holding the company’s shares.  J. Crew dropped $1.76, or 5 percent, to $33.12 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The percentage
decline was the largest since Aug. 27. The  shares  have fallen
26 percent this year.  The retailer now has a sale on its website with some items,
such as a  pink dress , discounted more than 70 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
