Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney
said that recent “tensions” over efforts by some countries to
weaken their currencies is a threat to economic growth, and he’s
watching for signs of an unwarranted rise in the Canadian
dollar.  “In the long term this is in no one’s interest,” Carney
said in an interview with Canadian Broadcasting Corp. “We will
end up globally and in Canada with a lower level of growth.”  “The risk here is that that puts upward pressure on our
currency more than is warranted and that has a short-term impact
on the Canadian economy, and we are watching that risk very
closely.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
