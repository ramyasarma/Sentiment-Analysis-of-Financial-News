The Texas Rangers hit four home
runs, two by Josh Hamilton, to beat the New York Yankees 10-3
and move within a win of their first trip to the World Series.  Bengie Molina’s three-run home run off A.J. Burnett with
two outs in the sixth inning at Yankee Stadium erased a 3-2
deficit for the Rangers. Texas added five runs over the last
three innings, with Hamilton hitting two solo home runs and
Nelson Cruz adding a two-run shot.   The Rangers, who have 15 home runs this postseason, now
hold a 3-1 lead in the American League Championship Series.
Since baseball’s league championship series went to a best-of-
seven format in 1985, 13 of the 17 teams with a 3-1 ALCS lead
have reached the World Series.   Game 5 is scheduled for today at Yankee Stadium, where
pitcher CC Sabathia will start for the Yankees against the
Rangers’ C.J. Wilson. The ALCS would return to Arlington, Texas,
for the final two games, if necessary.   The San Francisco Giants beat the Philadelphia Phillies 3-0
yesterday for a 2-1 lead in the National League Championship
Series. Matt Cain allowed two hits over seven innings to send
the Phillies to their first postseason shutout since the 1983
World Series.   Game 4 of the NLCS is set for tonight in San Francisco,
with Joe Blanton scheduled to start for the Phillies against 21-
year-old Giants rookie Madison Bumgarner.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
