Malcolm Calvert , the ex-partner at
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. ’s Cazenove unit who served a third of his
21-month sentence for insider trading, dropped his appeal of the
conviction and a 524,000-pound ($827,000) penalty.  Calvert, who was released from prison about two weeks ago,
has since ended his challenge at the Court of Appeal,  Financial
Services Authority  spokesman Christopher Hamilton said today.
The early release was the decision of the U.K. prison service,
he said.  Judge  Peter Testar  in May ordered Calvert to forfeit
474,000 pounds and pay another 50,000 pounds to cover the FSA’s
prosecution costs. At an earlier hearing, the FSA had asked for
almost 500,000 pounds in costs.  Calvert was convicted in March. It was the FSA’s third
criminal insider-trading case to reach a jury trial. The FSA
promised to bring more charges and be a tougher regulator, after
pledges by Conservative lawmakers to carve up its powers.  Harvey Dyson, Calvert’s lawyer, didn’t return an e-mail
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
