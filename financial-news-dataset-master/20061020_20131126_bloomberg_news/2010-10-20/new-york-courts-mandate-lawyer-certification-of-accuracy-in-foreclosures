New York state courts will require
lawyers in residential foreclosure actions to certify they have
taken “reasonable” steps to verify the accuracy of documents
submitted to the court.  The new rule, released in a statement by the New York state
Unified Court System, is effective immediately.  Chief Judge  Jonathan Lippman  introduced the requirement in
response to disclosures of deficiencies in residential
foreclosure  filings  nationwide, including notarization and
“robo-signing” and affidavits that falsely state the signer
has knowledge of the facts, the statement said.  “We cannot allow the courts in New York State to stand by
idly and be party to what we now know is a deeply flawed
process, especially when that process involves basic human needs
-- such as a family home -- during this period of economic
crisis,” Lippman said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
