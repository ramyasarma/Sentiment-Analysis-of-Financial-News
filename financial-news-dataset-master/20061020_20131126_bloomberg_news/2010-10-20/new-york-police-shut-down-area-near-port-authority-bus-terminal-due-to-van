New York City police shut down an
area near the Port Authority bus terminal in midtown Manhattan
due to an unattended “suspicious” minivan parked nearby, NYPD
Detective  Joseph Cavitolo  said.  On Sept. 2, a black Mercedes sedan parked on Manhattan’s
Park Avenue was reported in a 911 call as suspicious and later
determined to be harmless. The investigation of that car, parked
two blocks from JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s headquarters, caused
traffic on the avenue to be shut down between East 50th Street
and East 57th Street.  To contact the reporter on this story:
