Soccer’s rule-setting body will
again review goal-line technology after referees missed several
scores during the most-recent World Cup tournament and in league
matches.  The International Football Association Board, which frames
the sport’s laws, wants to find an accurate system that will
determine whether the ball has passed over the goal line within
a second of the incident, the group said today in an e-mailed
 statement . The technology will only focus on scoring situations,
and officials will get the indication of whether a goal has been
scored, the IFAB said after a meeting in Wales.  Technology companies have until the end of November to
present their products to soccer governing body FIFA. Following
a testing period with a “selected number of companies,” the
IFAB will discuss the issue at a meeting March 4-6.  FIFA said in March that the “door is closed” on the use
of technology such as video. The governing body decided to re-
examine the issue after a number of incidents at this year’s
World Cup in South Africa.  England’s  Frank Lampard  had a goal disallowed in a 4-1 loss
to Germany, even though television replays showed his shot had
crossed the line. Later that day, Argentina’s  Carlos Tevez 
scored a controversial goal, which the referee allowed to stand.
Television replays, as well as the video screen in the stadium,
showed Tevez in an offside position.  To contact the reporter on this story:
