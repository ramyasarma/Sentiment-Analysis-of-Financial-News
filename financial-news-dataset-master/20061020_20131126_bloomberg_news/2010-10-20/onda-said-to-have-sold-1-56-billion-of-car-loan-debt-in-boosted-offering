Honda Motor Co. sold $1.56 billion
of bonds tied to auto loans, according to a person familiar with
the transaction, the automaker’s largest offering this year.  The issue was initially $1 billion, said the person, who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t public. The
largest top-rated portion, a $479 million slice maturing in 1.9
years, yields 20 basis points more than the benchmark interest
rate. Honda last sold similar debt on May 11, and paid the same
amount, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ford Motor Credit Co. is marketing $819.1 billion in asset-
backed bonds tied to lease payments, a person familiar with that
sale said. A $255 million slice, carrying top ratings and
maturing in 1.6 years, may yield between 40 basis points and 45
basis points more than the benchmark interest rate. Ford last
sold similar debt in January, and paid an 85 basis-point spread
on debt maturing in 1.4 years, Bloomberg data show.  Sales tied to auto financing account for about $54.6
billion of the approximately $99.6 billion in asset-backed debt
sold in 2010, Bloomberg data show. About $56 billion of the
securities was sold during the same time frame last year, the
data show.  Top-rated securities tied to cars yield 58 basis points
more than Treasuries, compared with 79 basis points at the start
of the year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
