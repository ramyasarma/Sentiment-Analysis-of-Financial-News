Asian stocks  dropped for a fourth
day, the longest losing streak for the region’s benchmark index
in two months, after China unexpectedly raised interest rates to
curb inflation in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Hong Kong-listed  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. , the biggest
real-estate company in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou,
slumped 5.3 percent. Miner  Rio Tinto Group , which counts China
as its largest market, decreased 1.7 percent in Sydney.  Inpex
Corp. , Japan’s biggest energy explorer, dropped 3.4 percent.
 Canon Inc. , a Japanese camera maker that gets about 80 percent
of its revenue overseas, fell 2 percent after the yen climbed to
a one-month high against the euro.  “The perceived problem with China raising rates is it
limits economic growth from one of the higher growth
economies,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about $1
billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “Markets in Asia
have adopted a very cautious approach to today’s trading in
light of this news.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  declined 0.3 percent to 129.43
as of 5:59 p.m. in Tokyo. It has fallen 2 percent in the past
four days, the longest series of declines since Aug. 9-12. China
yesterday raised borrowing costs for the first time since 2007
as policy makers try to curb lending and prevent asset-price
bubbles in a country that surpassed Japan in the second quarter
as the world’s second-largest economy.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  dropped 1.7 percent, while
Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index  lost 0.9 percent. Australia’s  S&P/ASX
200 Index  slid 0.7 percent.  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index  rose less than 0.1 percent
after falling as much as 2 percent and climbing 1.3 percent.
Some investors bought insurers on speculation they will benefit
from higher interest rates.  Borrowing Costs  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.4
percent. The index lost 1.6 percent yesterday, the biggest drop
since Aug. 19, amid concern banks will be forced to buy back
soured mortgages and after  Apple Inc.  forecast profit that
missed analyst estimates.  Shares of  Chinese real-estate companies  led the drop among
Asian equities on concern higher borrowing costs will deter
demand for housing. China’s central bank yesterday raised one-
year lending and  deposit rates  by 25 basis points.  Guangzhou R&F Properties slumped 5.3 percent to HK$11.52.
 Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. , which receives all its sales from
China, dropped 5.8 percent to HK$12.90. Agile Property Holdings
Ltd., which builds villas and apartments in China’s southern
Guangdong province, tumbled 6.1 percent to HK$9.93.  Investment Returns  Shares of Chinese banks also dropped in Hong Kong.

jumped 4.5 percent to 27.88 yuan, while Ping An Insurance
(Group) Co. surged 7 percent to 66.98 yuan. Life insurers will
benefit from improved investment returns and gain flexibility to
price products, Ivan Leung, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities
Co., wrote in a report dated today.  Investors should buy Chinese stocks on dips as “earnings
are solid, valuations are reasonable and the rate hike could
actually remove the risk of an overhang,” Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. analysts including  Helen Zhu  and  Timothy Moe  wrote in a
report.  Gauges of energy and raw-material producers posted the
 biggest and fourth-biggest declines  respectively among the 10
industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, on concern the
rate increase in China will crimp demand for commodities.  Commodity Stocks Fall  Rio Tinto decreased 1.7 percent to A$81.21. BHP Billion
Ltd., the largest mining company in the world, declined 0.7
percent to A$40.88.  Mitsubishi Corp. , Japan’s biggest
commodities trader, fell 2.4 percent to 2,000 yen. Smaller rival
Mitsui & Co. dipped 2.7 percent to 1,293 yen.  Inpex Corp., decreased 3.4 percent to 432,000 yen.  Cnooc
Ltd. , China’s biggest offshore oil and gas explorer, lost 2.6
percent to HK$15.92. Santos Ltd., Australia’s third-largest oil
and gas producer, fell 2.2 percent to A$12.46.  Crude oil for November delivery sank 4.3 percent to settle
at $79.49 a barrel yesterday in New York, the steepest drop
since Feb. 4. The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals
including aluminum and copper lost 2.1 percent yesterday, the
largest decline since Oct. 7.  The measure completed its seventh weekly advance last week,
the longest winning streak since 2006, on speculation growth in
corporate profits will weather Europe’s debt crisis, Chinese
steps to curb property-price inflation and concern about the
pace of the U.S. economic rebound.  Policy Action  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has risen 7.4 percent this year
as government and industry reports from the U.S. and China
fueled confidence in the global economic recovery. Stocks in the
gauge trade at 14.3 times  estimated profit  on average, compared
with 13.9 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  yesterday called for
“collective” policy action to rebalance the world economy.
Failure to find common ground risks the imposition of trade
barriers and weaker global growth, he said before a meeting
later this week of Group of 20 finance ministers and central
bankers in South Korea.  Japanese exporters dropped as the yen climbed to a one-
month high against the euro, threatening to reduce the value of
European sales when repatriated. The yen rose to 111.56 per
euro, the highest since Sept. 21, from 112 yesterday in New
York.  Canon slipped 2 percent to 3,760 yen.  Panasonic Corp. , the
