European  gasoline fell for a third
day. Vitol Group and Trafigura Beheer BV bought naphtha cargoes.  Strikes in France continued to curtail production of fuels,
leading to shortages. Nine of 11 refineries in France are halted
and two are running at reduced rates, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Plants in the country can process 1.84 million
barrels of oil a day. Workers were striking for a second week
while protests at ports caused 69 vessels to be stranded.  Brent crude gained $1.96, or 2.4 percent, to $83.06 a
barrel on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange at 5:50 p.m.
local time.  LIGHT OIL PRODUCTS  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought four lots of gasoline for
immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp, Europe’s oil-
trading hub, at prices from $741 to $744 a metric ton in the
morning, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus bulletin board. Gunvor International Ltd.
sold 3,000 tons and Chevron Corp. sold one lot.  Trades took place from $729 to $736 a ton during the Platts
pricing window that ends at 4:30 p.m. in London, according to a
survey of brokers and traders who participate in the window.  Barges traded as low as $732 and as high as $775 a ton
yesterday. The trades are for Eurobob grade to which ethanol is
added to make finished motor fuel.  Premium unleaded gasoline traded at $741 and $743 a ton,
according to the survey of Platts prices.  Vitol bought a 12,500-ton cargo of naphtha from BASF AG at
$750 a ton, priced for delivery to Rotterdam from Oct. 30 to
Nov. 3, according to the Platts survey. Trafigura paid $752 a
ton to Glencore International Ltd. for the same volume, priced
for delivery to Rotterdam from Nov. 9 to Nov. 13.  The  naphtha crack , or spread relative to Brent, was at a
premium of 50 cents a barrel compared with a discount of $2 on
Oct. 1. The margin, a measure of refining returns, has been
showing a profit for four days, the longest winning streak since
March 16.  MIDDLE DISTILLATES  Gasoil futures for November delivery gained 0.6 percent to
$708.25 a ton on the ICE exchange. The contract for December was
at $710.75 a ton.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of profitability for refiners
processing crude into the fuel, narrowed to $12.08 a barrel from
$13.60 a barrel yesterday, according to ICE data.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges traded at a premium of $24
and $25 to November ICE gasoil futures, according to the Platts
survey. Two cargo deals were done at a premium of $36 to
November gasoil futures.  Morgan Stanley bought two jet-fuel cargoes from Vitol at
$48 and $49 a ton above November ICE gasoil, the survey showed.
Shell bought jet-fuel barges at $45 and $46 a ton more than the
futures price, according to the survey. That compares to
yesterday’s barge trades at premiums from $45 to $47 a ton to
the gasoil futures price.  FRENCH STRIKE  Total SA, Petroplus Holdings AG, Exxon Mobil Corp. and
LyondellBasell Industries NV halted production from sites across
France. Only Ineos Group Holdings Plc’s Lavera refinery and
Exxon’s Fos plant are running at reduced rates.  French oil companies plan to share supplies and transport
in order to combat shortages,  Jean-Louis Schilansky , head of the
refiners’ group, Union Francaise des Industries Petroliers, said
after a meeting with Prime Minister  Francois Fillon  yesterday.
It would take several days to restore supplies, he said.  “We have the products in the depots; we just can’t get
them to where they’re needed,” he said. “By sharing our stock
and our means of transport we have greater flexibility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
