Vancouver Canucks forward  Rick Rypien  was suspended for shoving a fan during a National Hockey
League game against the Minnesota Wild.  Rypien was being escorted off the ice following a fight
with Minnesota’s  Brad Staubitz  at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul
last night.  As he was separated from Staubitz by linesman Don
Henderson, Rypien appeared to shove the official. When he then
walked down a tunnel toward the team’s locker room, Rypien can
be seen on video grabbing and shoving a fan who was wearing a
Wild jersey and applauding.  Rypien will remain suspended pending a league hearing.
Under NHL rules, all clashes between players and spectators are
reviewed by Commissioner  Gary Bettman .  To contact the reporter on this story:
