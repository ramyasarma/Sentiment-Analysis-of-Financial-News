the first drop in the last four trading days. The Seville-based
engineering company sold $650 million of senior notes due in
November 2017 after boosting the size of the transaction,
according to a person familiar with the offering. The 8.875
percent notes were priced at 98.095 cents on the dollar to yield
9.25 percent, said the person, who declined to be identified
because terms aren’t set.  Banco Santander SA  (SAN SM) slipped 0.7 percent to 9.55
euros, snapping a three-day gain. Spain’s biggest bank and other
Spanish lenders are negotiating the sale of bad loan portfolios
to U.S. investment funds after the central bank tightened the
rules on provisioning, Expansion reported.  Separately, Santander should consider cutting its dividend
payout or selling stock in a rights offer instead of holding an
initial public offering of its U.K. assets, Mediobanca SpA
analysts wrote in a note to clients today.  Prosegur Compania de Seguridad SA  (PSG SM) retreated 2.6
percent to 45.85 euros, breaking four days of increases. The
security services company was downgraded to “hold” from
“buy” at Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
