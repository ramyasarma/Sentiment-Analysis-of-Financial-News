The U.S. economy will disappoint
investors by expanding at a rate of 1.75 percent over the next
year, said  Ramin Toloui  at Pacific Investment Management Co.,
which runs the world’s biggest bond fund.  The risks are skewed toward even slower growth, Toloui, an
emerging markets portfolio manager, said on a conference call.
Growth will fall short of the consensus forecast, which is 2.6
percent for the year ahead, according to Pimco. Investors should
add to their emerging-market holdings, Toloui said.  “We’re still seeing a tentativeness in the financial
sector to take risk” in the U.S., Toloui said in a conference
call from Pimco’s head office in Newport Beach, California.
“When we balance what the optimists point to and the pessimists
point to, we think that the overall alignment of facts points
toward a much more cautious conclusion about the trajectory of
the U.S. economy.”  Toloui spoke as Federal Reserve officials debate whether to
increase the central bank’s Treasury purchases to stimulate the
U.S. economy. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Oct. 15 that
that there appears to be a “case for further action.”  Japan will continue to be the “lowest growth component”
of the industrial world and the entire global economy, Toloui
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
