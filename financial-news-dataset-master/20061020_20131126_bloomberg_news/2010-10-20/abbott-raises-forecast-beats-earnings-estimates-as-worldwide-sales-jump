Abbott Laboratories , a maker of
drugs and medical devices, fell after it reported third-quarter
sales that missed analysts’ estimates.  The shares dropped 45 cents, or less than 1 percent, to
$52.42 at 4:03 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The Abbott Park, Illinois-based company today said net
income declined 40 percent to $891 million, or 57 cents a share,
because of costs for its purchase of Solvay SA’s drug unit.  Sales increased 12 percent to $8.68 billion, missing the
$8.92 billion average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue was less than analysts projected because
Abbott recalled its Similac baby formula in September, said  Rick Wise , an analyst with Leerink Swann & Co.  “Sales were light, $215 million below our estimate, the
miss was largely a result of the September Similac recall, which
Abbott had previously indicated would be a $100 million hit to
the top line,” Wise said in a research report today.  Worldwide nutritional sales fell 1.5 percent to $1.37
billion, the company said. Pharmaceutical sales increased 22
percent to $4.94 billion.  Profit excluding some items was $1.05 a share, beating the
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg by 1 cent,  The company today also raised the lower end of its 2010
forecast. Abbott said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings
in the range of $4.16 to $4.18, up from its Sept. 22 forecast of
$4.13 to $4.18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
