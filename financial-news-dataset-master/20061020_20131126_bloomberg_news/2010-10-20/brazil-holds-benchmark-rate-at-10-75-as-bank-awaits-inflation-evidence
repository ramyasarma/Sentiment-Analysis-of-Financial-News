Brazil’s central bank, which left
borrowing costs unchanged yesterday, may keep its benchmark
interest rate at its current level until at least March as it
waits to see whether the country’s next president will restrain
public spending to contain inflation.  Policy makers, led by bank President  Henrique Meirelles ,
left the rate at 10.75 percent a second straight meeting
yesterday after assessing the “inflation perspectives,”
according to a one-sentence statement. The unanimous decision
was forecast by all 51 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  The bank’s inflation outlook assumes “significant fiscal
tightening” in 2011 and policy makers could be forced to raise
rates as early as the second quarter if the winner in this
month’s presidential runoff fails to curb spending growth, said
 Marcelo Carvalho , head of Latin American research at BNP Paribas
in Sao Paulo. Policy makers last month forecast consumer prices
will rise 4.6 percent in 2011, in line with their 4.5 percent
target, without further rate increases.  “We suspect the bank will eventually be forced to re-
engage in monetary tightening, but not now,” Carvalho, who
predicts policy makers will raise the Selic in April, said in a
phone interview. “Monetary policy may need to adjust if the
fiscal prospects look different.”  Record-Low Unemployment  A government report today showed that unemployment fell to
a record low 6.2 percent last month, from 6.7 percent in August.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected 6.5 percent,
according to the median of 36 analysts.  “Brazil’s labor market is very robust and the increase in
wages will fuel consumption in the coming months,” said  Silvio Campos Neto , chief economist at Banco Schahin SA. “This is
maybe the main inflationary risk in the short term and increases
the tendency for rate increases next year.”  On Sao Paulo’s BM&F Exchange the yield on the interest rate
future contract maturing in January 2012, rose 4 basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 11.31 percent at 11:16 a.m. New
York time. The real weakened 1.0 percent to 1.6942 per dollar.  Analysts predict the central bank will raise the Selic rate
to 11.25 percent in April, and then to 11.75 percent in June,
according to the median forecast of about 100 economists in an
Oct. 15 central bank survey.  Presidential Runoff  Brazilians head to the polls Oct. 31 to elect President
 Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva’s successor. Front-runner  Dilma Rousseff , Lula’s former Cabinet chief, increased her lead over
rival  Jose Serra  to 11 percentage points, according to an Ibope
poll of 3,010 people taken from Oct. 17 to Oct. 20. A Sensus
poll published yesterday gave Rousseff a 5-point lead.  “I expect public spending will increase at a slower pace
with either Dilma or Serra,”  Roberto Padovani , chief economist
at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA, said in a phone interview. “If
this hypothesis proves false, the central bank may change
tack.”  Padovani said rates could stay unchanged for the next 12
months as the central bank gauges the impact of the budget plans
by the government that takes office Jan. 1.  Spending Surge  Spending by the federal government increased to 18.6
percent of gross domestic product in July 2010 from 15.6 percent
when Lula took office in January 2003, according to Tendencias
Consultoria Integrada, a Sao Paulo-based consulting firm.  Strong domestic demand is fueling inflation in Latin
America’s biggest economy.  A report yesterday showed that October’s mid-month
 inflation  rate doubled from September, led by the second-biggest
jump in  food prices  in 27 months. Prices as measured by the
IPCA-15 index rose 0.62 percent, taking the annual rate to 5.03
percent.  Policy makers first held the benchmark rate at 10.75 percent
at their Aug. 31-Sept. 1 meeting, after raising it 200 basis
points earlier this year from a record low 8.75 percent.  The central bank estimates the world’s eighth-biggest
economy will grow 7.3 percent in 2010, the fastest pace in more
than two decades.  Retail sales  rose a faster-than-forecast 2
percent in August from a month earlier, fueled by credit growth
and record-low unemployment rate of 6.7 percent.  Brazil’s GDP may grow 7.5 percent this year, up from a
previous estimate of 7 percent, the Finance Ministry said in a
 report  published on its website today. The ministry also raised
its forecast for average growth between 2010 and 2014 to 5.9
percent, from 5.7 percent.  Consumer prices may rise 5.1 percent this year, the
ministry said, raising its July forecast of 5 percent.  Economic Activity  The economic activity index, a proxy for gross domestic
product, leveled off in August. Seasonally-adjusted economic
activity was little changed at 139.12 points in August, down
from a revised 139.13 points in July, the central bank said
yesterday on its website.  Record-low interest rates in the  U.S. , coupled with signs
of additional easing by the Federal Reserve, helped push
Brazil’s currency to 1.6442 per dollar on Oct. 14, its strongest
since September 2008.  While helping to restrain inflation, the real’s surge
against the dollar also threatens to dent growth as the
country’s goods become less competitive overseas.  In a bid to protect Brazil’s  exports  from what he called a
global “currency war,” Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  on Oct.
18 raised taxes on foreign inflows for the second time this
month.  The Finance Ministry sees the current account deficit
widening to $49.5 billion this year and to $58.8 billion next
year, its report showed.  The ministry had previously seen a gap of $45.9 billion
this year and $56 billion in 2011. The gap is “temporary” and
won’t compromise growth in coming years, the ministry said in
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
