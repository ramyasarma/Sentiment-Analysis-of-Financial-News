Blue Label Telecoms Ltd., the South
African phone-services reseller, is looking for acquisitions to
increase its footprint and product lines, joint-Chief Executive
Officer Mark Levy said.  Acquisitions may also be “defensive” to “keep someone
out of what we are doing,” he said in a presentation in
Johannesburg today. Since listing its stock, the company has
spent as much as 500 million rand on acquisitions, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
