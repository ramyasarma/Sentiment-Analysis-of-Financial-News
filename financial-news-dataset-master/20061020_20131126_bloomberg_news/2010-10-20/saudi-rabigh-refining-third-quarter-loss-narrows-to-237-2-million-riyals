Rabigh Refining and Petrochemicals
Co., a joint venture between state-owned Saudi Aramco and
Sumitomo Chemical Co. of Japan, said third-quarter loss narrowed
to 237.2 million riyals from 844.7 million riyals loss in the
year ago period.  The loss was due to lower sales of petrochemical products
because of the shutdown of plants in August, according to a
company statement to the Saudi bourse today. All units are
currently operating at normal capacity, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
