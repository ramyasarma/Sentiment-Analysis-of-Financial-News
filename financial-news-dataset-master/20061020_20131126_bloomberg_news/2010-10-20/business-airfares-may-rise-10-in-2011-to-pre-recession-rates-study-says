Business-class airfares on long-haul
international flights may rise as much as 10 percent in 2011,
returning to pre-recession prices, after carriers cut seating
capacity,  American Express Business Travel  said.  The biggest increases for those tickets will be in the
Asia-Pacific region, at 5 percent to 10 percent, while gains in
North America will be 3 percent to 7 percent, according to the
 American Express Co.  unit, which helps manage corporate travel
accounts. Lodging also will cost more, the unit said today.  “Pricing power will swing back to air and hotel suppliers
for the first time in two years in 2011 as more competition for
limited seats on planes and increased occupancy levels at hotels
are expected,” Christa Degnan Manning, the unit’s research
chief, said in a statement.  The business-travel slump during the recession spurred U.S.
airlines to chop available seating by about 6.8 percent in 2009,
the deepest pullback since World War II. U.S. carriers led by
 Delta Air Lines Inc.  start reporting third-quarter earnings
today that may show their biggest profit since 2007.  American Express Business Travel said it made pricing
predictions for 89 types of airfares covering 21 countries, and
for hotel rates in 535 cities around the world.  International long-haul airfares in business class will
cost 5 percent to 9 percent more in Europe and the Middle East,
and 3 percent to 8 percent more in Latin America, according to
the forecast.  Economy tickets on domestic short-haul flights will be up 2
percent to 9 percent, depending on the region, with North
America showing the smallest increases at 2 percent to 6
percent, American Express Business Travel said.  Hotel rates for “upper-range” properties will rise by 2
percent to 10 percent, led by a 5 percent to 10 percent gain in
Asia, according to the forecast. Rooms in “mid-range” hotels
will climb as much as 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
