Russia plans to sell as much as 15
percent of  OAO Rosneft , its biggest oil producer, as the
government seeks to raise 1.8 trillion rubles ($59 billion) in
asset sales in the next five years to help balance the budget.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s government approved the
plan to sell stakes in about 900 companies, including lenders
OAO Sberbank and VTB Group, First Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Shuvalov  said late yesterday. The comments, initially reported
by Interfax, were confirmed by Shuvalov’s spokesman.  The government will use some of the revenue to narrow its
 budget gap  to 1.8 trillion rubles, or 3.6 percent of gross
domestic product, in 2011 from an estimated 5.3 percent this
year. Russia had a shortfall of 5.9 percent last year, its first
deficit in a decade, after the  economy  posted its biggest
contraction on record.  “The government views privatization not only as a way to
finance the budget deficit, but also as a tool for improving the
investment climate and increasing competition,” Alfa Bank
economists  Natalia Orlova  and  Dmitry Dolgin  wrote today in a
research note. Relinquishing control of key companies would be
“the most important step in this direction,” they said.  The Finance Ministry in July proposed selling minority
stakes in 10 companies, including Rosneft, Sberbank and VTB, as
part of a three-year privatization plan. The government last
year earmarked about 5,500 enterprises for divestment and
pledged to sell shares in companies that are already publicly
traded to help cut the deficit.  ‘Begin Immediately’  Putin and President  Dmitry Medvedev  must sign the
government’s privatization plan before it comes into force.
Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  reiterated yesterday that Russia
aims to balance the budget by 2015.  “If the president agrees with this plan, we will translate
it into concrete actions by the ministries in order to begin
immediately,” Shuvalov said.  The government plans to reduce its holding in Sberbank,
Russia’s biggest lender, to a controlling stake between 2011 and
2014, Shuvalov said.  Russia will “try to complete” the sale of a 10 percent
stake in VTB Group, the country’s second-biggest bank, this year
and may sell an additional 10 percent in 2011 and 10 percent to
15 percent in 2012, according to Shuvalov. The government is
ready to “discuss the possibility” of cutting its holding to
less than a controlling stake of 50 percent plus one share
within three years, he said.  Shares Rise  The government owns 60.3 percent of  Sberbank  and 85.5
percent of  VTB Group , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sberbank, which accounts for 15 percent of the 30-stock
Micex Index, surged to its highest since January 2008, adding
5.9 percent to 103.29 rubles at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow.
VTB rose 6.1 percent to 9.93 kopeks. Rosneft advanced 4.3
percent to 218.66 rubles, the highest level since June 15.  In the energy industry, Russia may sell as much as 15
percent of  Rosneft  from 2012 to 2015 and cut its interest to
less than control if “all that’s planned for Rosneft up to
2015” is fulfilled, Shuvalov said. Russia owns more than 75
percent of Rosneft, Bloomberg data show.  The government isn’t considering selling stakes in pipeline
operator OAO Transneft, included in the Finance Ministry’s July
list, or oil producer OAO Zarubezhneft, mentioned by Finance
Minister  Alexei Kudrin  on Oct. 19, at the moment, Shuvalov said.  Transneft slumped by the most since July 1, falling 5.8
percent to 36,477.74 rubles.  Supporting Ruble  Asset sales will provide “medium-term” support for the
ruble and may bolster Russian stocks during the next year, Royal
Bank of Canada analysts led by  Nick Chamie , global head of
emerging markets, wrote in a research note late yesterday.  “Russia is one of the few emerging markets globally
undertaking a privatization drive during these volatile times,”
he said.  The ruble strengthened 0.2 percent to 30.6037 per dollar.
The  Micex stock index  approached its 2010 high, rising 2.3
percent to 1,528.11.  Russia may sell 25 percent minus one share of OAO Russian
Railways, the state-owned rail monopoly, from 2013 to 2015 and
50 percent minus one share of OAO Sovcomflot, Russia’s biggest
shipper, by 2013, Shuvalov said.  The government may also reduce its holding in  OAO Aeroflot ,
the national carrier, to a controlling stake. Russia owns about
51.2 percent of Aeroflot, according to Bloomberg data.  In addition, the government is “ready to immediately
prepare” for the sale of a 4.11 percent stake in Federal Grid
Co., in which it holds 79.11 percent.  ‘Best Behavior’  Officials are considering selling part of the government’s
stake in  OAO Rostelecom  after the restructuring of OAO
Svyazinvest, the national telephone holding, Shuvalov said.  Aeroflot snapped four days of gains, retreating 0.2 percent
to 74.71 rubles. Federal Grid rose 3.3 percent to 37.4 kopeks.
Rostelecom slid for a second day, falling 0.6 percent to 138.14
rubles.  The privatization plan may “encourage ‘best behavior’ from
the government, and a more investor-friendly approach should
appease investor sentiment towards Russia,”  Andrew Howell  and
 Maria Gratsova , analysts at Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote in
an e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
