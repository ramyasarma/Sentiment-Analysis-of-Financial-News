European Commission President Jose
Barroso backed German calls for a “permanent” crisis-
resolution mechanism to replace the financial backstop for debt-
hit governments that expires in 2013.  “We will also do all we can to be better preparerd for
critical developments than we were last time,” Barroso told the
European Parliament in Strasbourg, France today. A permanent
mechanism “can prevent such developments from arising in the
future.”  Barroso said the commission will look at how to structure a
permanent system, acknowledging that all 27 European Union
countries would have to agree on changes to the EU’s treaties.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
