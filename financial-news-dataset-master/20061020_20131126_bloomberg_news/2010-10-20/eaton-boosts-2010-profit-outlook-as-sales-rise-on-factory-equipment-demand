Eaton Corp. , a maker of parts for
factory equipment and cranes, raised its full-year profit
forecast as third-quarter net income climbed 39 percent on
higher sales of  hydraulic  components.  Full-year operating profit will be as much as $5.55 a
share, compared with a July projection of at most $5.10, the
Cleveland-based company said today in a statement. Third-quarter
operating earnings were $1.60, exceeding analysts’ average
estimate of $1.38 as revenue climbed 18 percent.  Eaton, among the first U.S. industrial companies to report
third-quarter results, also sells electrical products as well as
parts for cars and planes, making it a barometer for the
economy. The company now sees end markets increasing 10 percent
in 2010, compared with an earlier forecast of 8 percent, driven
by growth outside the U.S. Hydraulics sales climbed 39 percent.  “Hydraulics are used in everything from transmissions and
power management to industrial,”  Brian Rayle , an analyst for
Cleveland-based Northcoast Research who has a “buy” rating on
Eaton stock, said today in an interview. “We’re not at the
point where people are opening new factories but if you want to
get more efficiencies using new hydraulics, new pneumatic
systems in factories, there’s a good way to get productivity
without a lot of capex.”  Third-quarter net income rose to $268 million, or $1.57 a
share, from $193 million, or $1.14, a year earlier, the company
said. Eaton’s revenue of $3.57 billion exceeded the average
analyst estimate of $3.42 billion.  Eaton climbed $2.84, or 3.4 percent, to $86.25 at 8:31 a.m.
in  trading  before the regular open of the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares gained 31 percent this year before today.  Economic Recovery  Eaton’s raised per-share operating profit forecast exceeded
the $5.14 average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
The company reported earnings of $2.59 on that basis in 2009.  Parker Hannifin Corp., a maker of valves and pumps used in
factory equipment, boosted its annual profit forecast yesterday.
Manufacturing during the U.S. economic recovery, which began in
June 2009, was boosted by climbing exports, improving business
investment and replenishing inventory.  Sales at Eaton’s hydraulics division, which made pumps and
valves used on a drilling rig that helped free the trapped
miners in Chile, climbed to $583 million. Eaton today boosted
its forecast for global demand for hydraulics, now seeing
markets increasing 31 percent, compared with its previous
estimate of 26 percent.  Revenue at Eaton’s Electrical Americas division, the
company’s largest, rose 15 percent to $967 million. The unit
makes circuit breakers, power distribution systems and meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
