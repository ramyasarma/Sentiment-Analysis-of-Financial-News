Corticeira Amorim SA  and Grupo
Visabeira SGPS SA will be the majority shareholders in a new
commercial bank that will be started in Mozambique next year,
Joao Figueiredo, the chairman-designate of the bank, said.  The two Portuguese companies will hold 51 percent of Banco
Unico, with the remainder owned by Mozambican institutional and
individual investors, Figueiredo said yesterday in an interview
in the capital, Maputo.  “The new bank will open branches throughout the country
and will look at embracing all sectors of the economy,” he
said.  Banco Unico has been licensed by the southern African
country’s central bank, Banco de Mocambique. State-run energy
company, Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos, is one of its
investors, Figueiredo said. The bank will be the 16th operating
in Mozambique, according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
