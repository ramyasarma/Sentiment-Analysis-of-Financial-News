UniCredit SpA’s foundation
shareholders may seek a “freeze” on stakes above 5 percent
held by Libyan institutions, Il Sole 24 Ore reported, without
providing further details.  The Libyan Investment Authority and the country’s central
bank own a combined 7.6 percent stake in the lender, according
to Sole. UniCredit restricts voting rights above 5 percent.  Italy’s stock-market regulator and the Bank of Italy are
investigating whether the Libyan holdings should be considered a
single stake.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
