Gold rebounded as the dollar resumed
a slide, boosting demand for the precious metal as an
alternative investment.  The greenback fell as much as 1.4 percent against a basket
of major currencies. Gold slid 2.6 percent yesterday after China
raised borrowing costs for the first time since 2007, spurring a
rally by the dollar. The metal has gained 23 percent this year,
reaching a record $1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14.  “People still don’t have a lot of faith in the dollar,”
said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago. “We see the dollar giving back a vast majority of its
gains yesterday. For the foreseeable future, the short-dollar
long-gold trade remains intact.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $8.20, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $1,344.20 at 1:52 p.m. on the Comex in New
York.  Before this week, gold rose to a record 16 times in a
month. The metal is headed for the 10th straight annual gain.  “Bargain hunters have given the complex a boost,” said
 James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London.  Gold’s gains may be limited should other nations begin
raising borrowing costs, said  Leonard Kaplan , the president of
Prospector Asset Management in Evanston, Illinois.  ‘Rates Do Matter’  China lifted its benchmark lending and deposit rates
yesterday after inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in 22
months. The one-year deposit rate will climb to 2.5 percent from
2.25 percent, and the lending rate will rise to 5.56 percent
from 5.31 percent, the  People’s Bank of China  said.  “Interest rates are the key to gold,” Kaplan said.
“China raised interest rates and gold collapsed. That proves
the hypothesis that interest rates do matter to the gold
market.”  Silver futures for December delivery rose 8.4 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $23.864 an ounce. This year, the price has gained 42
percent, reaching $24.95 on Oct. 14, the highest level since
March 1980.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $9.70, or 0.6
percent, to $1,687.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery gained $12.20, or
2.1 percent, to $590.65 an ounce. The metal reached $606.25 on
Oct. 7, the highest price since June 2001.  To contact the reporters on this story:
