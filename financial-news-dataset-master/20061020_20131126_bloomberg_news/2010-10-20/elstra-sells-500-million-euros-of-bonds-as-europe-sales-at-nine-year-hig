Telstra Corp. , Australia’s largest
telephone company, sold 500 million euros ($687 million) of 10
1/2-year bonds, paying less for the notes than its 1 billion
euro offering earlier this year.  The 3.625 percent bonds due in March 2021 were priced to
yield 95 basis points more than the euro swap rate, according to
a filing to the Australian stock exchange today. The sale was
managed by BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG and  HSBC Holdings
Plc , according to the statement.  “The bond priced at the tight end of market guidance,”
Telstra Chief Financial Officer  John Stanhope  said in the
statement. The order book closed within an hour, with more bids
than the bonds available, he said.  Telstra said last month it will spend A$1 billion ($969
million) to increase market share during the financial year by
meeting demand for its mobile and digital television services
and simplifying systems. In March, the Melbourne-based company
sold 1 billion euros of 4.25 percent 10-year bonds priced to
yield 103 basis points more than the swap rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on those notes fell 2.1 basis points to yield 3.5
percent at 11:27 a.m. in Sydney, on course for the first decline
in six trading days, according to Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices on Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Telstra’s total debt issuance in euros this year is the
most since 2001, Bloomberg data show.  Telstra  sold  its first domestic bonds since 2006 in June,
raising A$150 million from 10-year notes. The company may seek
to increase the proportion of its debt funding sourced in
Australian dollars to as much as 40 percent from about 20
percent currently,  National Australia Bank Ltd . analysts wrote
in a research note last month, citing a Telstra presentation.  The latest euro bond sale will be used to refinance debt
and for general working capital, according to the statement.
Telstra spokesman  Andrew Maiden  declined to comment on the sale
or future funding plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
