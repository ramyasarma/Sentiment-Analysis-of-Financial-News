Eaga Plc , which runs the U.K.
government-funded Warm Front heating insulation program, fell
the most in more than 2 1/2 years in London trading after the
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said the
initiative would be cut without giving a timeframe.  Eaga declined 24.75 pence, or 22.9 percent, to 83.5 pence
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. That’s the biggest one-day
drop since April 17, 2008. The stock has fallen 41.9 percent
this year, giving the company a market value of 209.9 million
pounds ($333 million).  “The statement today confirmed a budget of 110 million
pounds in 2011/12 and 100 million pounds in 2012/13 which is
considerably lower than our expectations,” Newcastle-Upon-Tyne,
England-based Eaga said today in a Regulatory News Service
statement. “Eaga will be discussing with the Department of
Energy and Climate Change the operational arrangements for the
Warm Front scheme for this period and will be considering the
likely resultant impact on Eaga’s performance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
