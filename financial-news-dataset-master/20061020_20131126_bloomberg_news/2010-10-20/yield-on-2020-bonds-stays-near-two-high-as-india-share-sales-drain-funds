India’s  10-year bonds  fell, pushing
yields to the highest level in two years, on speculation share
sales in state-owned companies will squeeze  cash in banks .  Banks  borrowed  an average of 497 billion rupees ($11.2
billion) from the central bank’s repurchase auction window each
day this month, compared with 251 billion rupees last month,
reflecting the demand for cash. The  central bank , which has
increased interest rates five times this year, will review its
policy next on Nov. 2.  “There is going to be a steady outflow of money due to
sale of stakes in government companies,” said  Krishnamurthy Harihar , treasurer at FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai. “Rate action
possibility is also there as inflation is not showing signs of
cooling.”  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose six
basis points to 8.14 percent as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The yield
touched 8.16 percent earlier, the highest level since October
2008. The price fell 0.44, or 44 paise per 100 rupee face amount,
to 97.75 rupees.  Coal India Ltd., the world’s largest producer of the fuel,
is selling as much as 151.5 billion rupees ($3.4 billion) of
stock in the nation’s biggest initial share sale. The offer
closes tomorrow.  India plans to step up share sales in the next six months
and offer stakes in seven companies including Indian Oil Corp.,
the nation’s second-biggest refiner,  Sumit Bose , the top
bureaucrat in charge of asset sales, said yesterday.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates, rose one basis point to 6.73
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
