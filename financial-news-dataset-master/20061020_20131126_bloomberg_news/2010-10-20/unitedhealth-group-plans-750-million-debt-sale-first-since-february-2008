UnitedHealth Group Inc. , the biggest
U.S. health insurer by revenue, plans to sell $750 million of
debt in its first bond offering since February 2008.  The insurer may issue $450 million of 10-year notes and
$300 million of 30-year debt as soon as today, according to a
person familiar with the transaction. Proceeds will be added to
general funds and may be used to meet working capital
requirements, repurchase or refinance outstanding securities, or
to fund acquisitions, UnitedHealth said today in a regulatory
filing that didn’t include the size or maturities of the sale.  UnitedHealth reported third-quarter earnings yesterday that
beat analyst estimates, as a jobless rate of more than 9 percent
kept Americans away from the doctor this year. The Minnetonka,
Minnesota-based company said  2011 profit  may decline because of
rising medical costs and the U.S. health-care overhaul. In
October, health-care debt has lost 0.1 percent, compared with a
0.59 percent gain on all corporate bonds, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show.  “There is uncertainty as always with election time, and in
any hot-spot topic like healthcare, it definitely comes into
play when you look at risks within a sector,” said  Rajeev Sharma , a money manager at First Investors Management, who helps
oversee $1.4 billion investment-grade debt in New York.
“Investors expect to be compensated for potential risks.”  Don Nathan , a spokesman for UnitedHealth, confirmed the
size of the bond sale and declined to otherwise comment on the
offering.  Yield Guidance  The 10-year notes may yield about 145 basis points, or 1.45
percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and
the 30-year bonds may pay a spread of about 185 basis points,
said the person familiar with the sale, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  Debt from health-care companies, including UnitedHealth and
competitors  WellPoint Inc.  and  Cigna Corp ., has returned 12.1
percent this year, on par with overall corporate debt, the index
data show.  In its last bond sale, UnitedHealth issued $3 billion of
senior unsecured debt in four parts, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  On March 23, President  Barack Obama  signed legislation
designed to extend insurance coverage to 32 million Americans.
The Obama administration and state insurance commissioners are
still drafting regulations to implement new spending rules, and
UnitedHealth can’t make a more precise forecast for 2011 before
the rule is finished, UnitedHealth Chief Executive Officer
 Stephen Hemsley  said yesterday on a conference call.  Investor Day  He said he may have more information by the insurer’s
investor conference in New York on Nov. 30.  UnitedHealth’s new debt may be rated Baa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service and A-, a step higher, by Standard & Poor’s,
the person said.  UnitedHealth’s 5.8 percent bonds due in 2036 traded on Oct.
15 at 102.454 cents on the dollar to yield 5.617 percent, or
163.7 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The debt was issued at 99.279 cents on the dollar at a
spread of 119 basis points, or 1.19 percentage points, Bloomberg
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
