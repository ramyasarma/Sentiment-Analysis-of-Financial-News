Chameleon Mining NL  shares fell the
most in two years after a judge today dismissed the Sydney-based
gold explorer’s claim to a share of  Murchison Metals Ltd. ’s iron
ore project in Western Australia.  Australia Federal Court Judge  Peter Jacobson  ruled that the
gold explorer is instead entitled to some profit from the
project. Chameleon will assess the profits it is entitled to, it
said in a statement today to the Australian stock exchange.  Chameleon shares fell as much as 31 percent, the biggest
decline since Oct. 31, 2008, and closed 28 percent lower at 2.1
Australian cents in Sydney trading.  The project has operated at a loss, Perth-based Murchison
said in a statement to the stock exchange today. Shares of the
iron ore company was halted today pending the release of the
judgment. The stock  rose  4.5 percent to A$1.52 in yesterday’s
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
