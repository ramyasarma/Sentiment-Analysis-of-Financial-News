India’s benchmark stock index fell
to a one-month low, led by raw material producers, after China
unexpectedly raised its lending and deposit rates, prompting
concern the global economic recovery may slow.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the biggest copper and
zinc producer, dropped 3.5 percent.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. ,
the biggest aluminum producer, retreated for the fifth day.  “Emerging markets have to raise rates to control a
possible asset bubble,” said  Alex Mathews , head of research at
Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
fell 110.98, or 0.6 percent, to 19,872.15 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The gauge is at its lowest level since Sept.
23. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange lost
0.8 percent to 5,982.1. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.6 percent
to 2,531.12.  Asian equities fell today after China’s central bank raised
one-year lending and  deposit rates  by 25 basis points, boosting
borrowing costs for the first time since 2007. Policy makers are
trying to curb lending and prevent an asset-price bubble in a
country that surpassed Japan this year as the world’s second-
largest economy.  Sterlite lost 3.5 percent to 170.15 rupees. Hindalco
decreased 1.6 percent to 203.15 rupees.  Raw Materials  A gauge of raw-material producers in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index dropped 0.7 percent amid concern the rate increase in
China will crimp demand in the world’s biggest energy-using
country.  Drugmakers  Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.  and  Jubilant Life Sciences
Ltd.  gained after they were rated “buy” in new coverage at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which cited an improving revenue
outlook, greater capacity utilization and easing balance sheet
concerns. Aurobindo advanced 1.9 percent to 1,160.6 rupees.
Jubilant jumped 5.5 percent to 319.15 rupees.  Overseas  investors  bought a net  8.16 billion rupees  ($184.3
million) of Indian equities on Oct. 18, extending this year’s
record inflows to 1.08 trillion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  Global funds have been net buyers of stocks for 34 trading
days, the longest run of inflows in more than five years since
the 40-day period ended Aug. 9, 2005, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
