Foreclosures of Spanish mortgages
rose to the highest ever as the economy deteriorated and
borrowers struggled to meet payments, Moody’s Investors Service
said.  Spanish banks seized a record 27,561 mortgages in the first
quarter, Moody’s said in a report today. Court cases related to
foreclosures rose by 59 percent in 2009 and 126 percent in 2008,
the report said.  Foreclosures hurt mortgage-backed securities which package
home loans and rely on the payment stream to repay bondholders.
So-called cash reserves to protect investors are being squeezed,
Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
