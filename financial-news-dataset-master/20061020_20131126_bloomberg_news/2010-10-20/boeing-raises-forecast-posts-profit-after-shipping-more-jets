Boeing Co. , the world’s largest
aerospace company, boosted its full-year earnings forecast and
posted a third-quarter profit as it delivered more jetliners,
recovering from delays caused by a supplier’s defective seats.  Net income was $837 million, or $1.12 a share, after a net
loss a year earlier of $1.56 billion, or $2.23, Chicago-based
Boeing said today. Profit beat 20 analysts’ average  estimate  of
$1.07 in a Bloomberg survey.  Boeing shipped more 737s, as well as 777s after receiving
replacements for the faulty seats, bolstering revenue from
airlines. Higher  production  of those planes is countering delays
on the 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 jumbo jet, two programs that
forced $3.5 billion in charges a year ago and led Boeing to its
biggest loss since at least 1983.  “Orders are doing very well, there’s good demand out there
and Boeing is executing on the commercial side,” said  Troy Lahr , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore who recommends
buying Boeing stock. “They still need to get through the
development programs, the 787 and 747-8, but all in all it looks
like they’re heading in the right direction.”  2010 Jet Deliveries  Full-year earnings will more than double to as much as $4 a
share, 20 cents higher than the previous maximum  forecast ,
Boeing said. The company said it will deliver 460 planes this
year, the lower end of its forecast range, and decreased its top
sales projection by $500 million to $65.5 billion. Boeing said
revenue will gain further next year.  Boeing rose $2.31, or 3.3 percent, to $71.36 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 32 percent this year before today, making Boeing the
third-best performer on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  Sales increased 1.7 percent to $17 billion in the quarter,
topping analysts’ $16.8 billion prediction.  Operating cash flow was $1.9 billion and will be more than
$1.5 billion for the year, rather than zero as previously
predicted, Boeing said.  Cash flow  will exceed $4 billion in
2011, coming in under the prior forecast of more than $5
billion, the planemaker said.  Defense Unit  “Operationally, they did very well at the commercial-
aircraft business, and some of that is offsetting the weakness
at the defense business, which has been concerning  investors ,”
Lahr said.  Boeing cut its projection for the defense unit’s operating
margin by 0.5 percentage point to 9 percent. The margin for the
division, which generates almost half of the company’s revenue,
narrowed to 8.4 percent last quarter because of lower pricing.  The company is turning to foreign military sales for growth
as the Pentagon scales back spending. Chief Executive Officer
 Jim McNerney  said he’ll continue to cut jobs at the unit.  Demand for the best-selling 737 and most-profitable 777
helped avert an extra charge last month after a year-long delay
on the 747-8 was extended by six months so engineers could
redesign part of the plane, the biggest Boeing has built.  McNerney repeated on a conference call today that he’s
confident the 747-8 will be delivered to the first customer in
mid-2011, and the plastic-composite 787 Dreamliner will enter
service in the first quarter of 2011, almost three years late.  Rolls-Royce Engine  Rolls-Royce Group Plc , one of two companies building
engines for the 787, is submitting new data to regulators to
prove that modifications to software and hardware are enough to
address a so-called uncontained engine failure, McNerney said.  The Aug. 2 engine blowout at Rolls-Royce’s test site in
Derby, England, flung debris out at high speed, piercing the
housing of the device. The company shuttered the plant for
repairs, and Boeing announced a sixth delay to the Dreamliner’s
first delivery later that month.  “If they say they’re confident and have the fix in hand,
then I believe them,” McNerney said today.  Once the 787 and 747-8 are certified, Boeing will have the
capacity to make improvements to the 777 this decade and develop
a replacement for the 737 “in the 2020 range,” McNerney said.
The company is also still studying the possibility of a new
engine, as well as options to improve the 737, he said.  Boeing’s net orders through September came to 392,
eclipsing all of last year’s orders as well as larger rival
Airbus SAS’s tally of 328. McNerney said full-year orders will
surpass the target of 460 deliveries amid a “slow, steady kind
of recovery.”  The commercial backlog grew 2.9 percent from the end of
June to 3,401 jets valued at $255 billion.  Order Recovery  Airlines are ordering more fuel-efficient planes as they
come out of the recession-induced travel slump, and McNerney
said Boeing is starting to see an increase in discretionary
spending for upgrades. Orders may take longer to recover than in
previous cycles, he said.  The company raised its forecast for the commercial unit’s
operating margin by 1 percentage point from the top of the
previous range, to 9.5 percent. The unit’s third-quarter
operating profit advanced to 11.6 percent of sales as it
delivered more of the pricier 777s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
