Irish house prices fell 1.3 percent
in the third quarter and further declines are possible, Irish
Life & Permanent Plc said.  Values have fallen 36 percent to an average 198,689 euros
($277,508) from their peak in late 2006, the Dublin-based  lender 
said today in an e-mailed statement. The average price is now at
the lowest since the third quarter of 2002, it said.  Irish property prices have plunged as unemployment rose
during the recession, banks restricted lending and a building
boom left the country with a glut of housing supply. The decline
in the third quarter compared with a 1.7 percent drop in the
three months through June and was the smallest since the second
quarter of 2008.  “This is the second successive quarter indicating that the
pace of decline in house prices is easing,” Niall O’Grady,
general manager at Irish Life’s permanent tsb unit, said in the
statement. “However, as the market remains very quiet, it may
be premature to conclude that we have reached the bottom.”  In Dublin,  house prices  fell 1.2 percent in the three
months through September after declines of 3.5 percent and 10.3
percent in the second and first quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
