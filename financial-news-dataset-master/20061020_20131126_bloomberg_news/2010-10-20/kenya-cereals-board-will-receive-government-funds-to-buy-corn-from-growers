Kenya’s cereals board will receive
500 million shillings ($6.18 million) from the government to buy
corn from farmers, after the Cabinet ordered the body to boost
strategic grain reserves.  “The government intends to increase maize reserves in
anticipation of a possible drought,” Evans Wasike, a spokesman
for the National Cereals and Produce Board, said in a phone
interview today from Nairobi, the capital. Kenya currently has
3.1 million 90-kilogram (198-pound) bags of grain reserves,
below the recommended 8 million, the Nation reported on Oct. 18,
without citing anyone.  Kenya’s government also wants to boost corn prices that
have fallen after growers began harvesting their crop, Wasike
said. A bag is currently selling for as low as 700 shillings, he
said. Odinga said the government will buy the harvest at 1,800
shillings a bag, the Nation said.  Earlier this month, assistant Agriculture Minister  Gideon Ndambuki  said Kenya may import as much as 270,000 metric tons of
corn from South Africa this year to cover an anticipated
shortfall.  The Cereal Growers Association in Kenya said on Sept. 13
that corn production may fall as much as 20 percent in the year
because of expected poor rains between October and December.
Output may decline from an earlier estimate of 30 million bags,
said  David Nyameino , chief executive officer of the association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
