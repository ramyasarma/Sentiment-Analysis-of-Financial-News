The death rate from  strokes  in U.S.
hospitals fell 26 percent as treatment technology improved.  The rate declined to 92 deaths per 1,000 stroke patients in
2007, from 125 deaths per 1,000 seven years earlier, according
to  data  released today by the U.S.  Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality . The rate for men fell 29 percent compared
with 24 percent for women, the figures showed. Fatality figures
also receded for heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia, the
agency reported.  The numbers reflect advances in the care that patients
receive at the hospitals, said  Roxanne Andrews , a senior
researcher at the agency, part of the federal  Department of
Health and Human Services .  “Patients are getting to the hospital earlier and maybe
patients are a little healthier than they used to be,” Andrews
said in a telephone interview. “But the decline does show that
patients are getting better treatment partly because the
technology for treating patients is getting better.”  Hospitals are acting faster to get antibiotics to pneumonia
patients, and anticlotting drugs to stroke and heart attack
sufferers, Andrews said.  For congestive heart failure, the death rate for hospital
patients fell 49 percent, to 28 fatalities per 1,000 patients
from 55 per 1,000, according to the report. The decline was 52
percent for men and 46 percent for women.  The death rate for patients treated in the hospital for
 heart attacks  went down 36 percent, to 67 per 1,000 from 106 per
1,000, the figures showed. The death rate for hospital patients
treated for pneumonia fell 45 percent, to 41 per 1,000 from 74
per 1,000.  Of the nation’s four regions, the Midwest showed the lowest
rate of death from all four conditions. In heart attacks, this
meant a turnaround from 2000 when the Midwest had the highest
figure, Andrews said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
