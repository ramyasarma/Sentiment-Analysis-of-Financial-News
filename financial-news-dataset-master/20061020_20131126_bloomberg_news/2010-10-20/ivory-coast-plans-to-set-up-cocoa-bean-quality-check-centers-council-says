Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest
producer of cocoa, plans to open control centers that would
reject damp or moldy beans for international export, the Cocoa
and Coffee Management Council said.  The measure, which comes into effect on Nov. 1, initially
restricts the sale or export of beans that have a humidity
content higher than 10 percent or moisture content of more than
5 percent, Gilbert Anoh, the head of the coffee-cocoa management
committee, said in a presentation yesterday in the commercial
capital, Abidjan. From Nov. 15, the requirements will fall to 8
percent and 4 percent respectively.  “All those who fail to respect these measures will be
sanctioned by the removal of their buying or export licenses,”
Anoh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
