Air France-KLM Group’s cargo
business could break even at the operating level in the year to
March 2011 as activity recovers faster than management expected,
French daily La Tribune reported, citing unidentified people
inside the company.  Air France-KLM’s current target is to reduce the previous
year’s losses of 436 million euros by two-thirds, and to achieve
breakeven in 2011-12, the newspaper said.  The possibility of breaking even takes into account the
impact of fuel hedges contracted before 2009, La Tribune added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
