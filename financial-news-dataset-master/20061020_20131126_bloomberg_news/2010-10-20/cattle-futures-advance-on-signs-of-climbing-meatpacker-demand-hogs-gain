Cattle futures jumped to a one-month
high as rising slaughter rates signaled that U.S. meatpacker
demand is increasing. Hogs also advanced.  Meatpackers processed 390,000 cattle in the first three
days of this week, or 3.7 percent more than last year, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Wholesale  choice beef 
jumped to $1.5968 a pound at midday, the highest level since
Sept. 9. Packers may pay 99 cents a pound for cattle this week,
up 2.6 cents from  last week , said  Chad Henderson , a market
analyst with Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc.  “Slaughter numbers have been relatively strong, so it
looks like we’ve had a little bit of a demand push,” Henderson
said from Brookfield, Wisconsin. “It’s encouraging that boxed
beef has picked up.”  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.675 cent, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $1.01625 a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price touched $1.0205,
the highest level since Sept. 17.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement fell 0.575
cent, or 0.5 percent, to $1.10375 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement increased 0.525 cent,
or 0.8 percent, to 68.725 cents a pound. Yesterday, the price
dropped to 67.5 cents, the lowest level since Feb. 11. The
commodity has gained 30 percent in the past year.  Commodities got a boost today as the  dollar  fell against a
basket of six major currencies, making U.S. goods more appealing
for importers. The dollar tumbled the most since July, while the
 Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials climbed
as much as 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
