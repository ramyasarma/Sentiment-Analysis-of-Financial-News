Afghanistan’s election commission
scrapped 1.3 million votes cast in last month’s parliamentary
ballot, its chief, Fazil Manawi, told reporters in Kabul today.  The vote count showed strong support for candidates
standing for the first time, and more than half the new
parliament may be newcomers, Manawi said, adding he was unable
to give a date when final results would be available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
