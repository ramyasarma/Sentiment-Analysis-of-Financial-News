Perpetual Ltd. won’t be pressured
into making a decision on Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.’s A$1.75
billion takeover bid by its annual general meeting on Oct. 26,
the Australian Financial Review reported, citing
unnamed people close to the deal. Talks haven’t advanced to a
stage where KKR has been invited to conduct due diligence, the
newspaper said. A committee including Perpetual chairman-elect
Peter Scott, chairman Bob Savage and three independent directors
are analyzing the proposal, the Review said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
