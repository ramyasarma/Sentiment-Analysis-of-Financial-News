Billionaire  Huang Guangyu ’s
representatives are talking with  Gome Electrical Appliances
Holdings Ltd.  about continuing the company’s procurement and
management agreements with his 400 privately owned stores.  Company founder Huang, serving a 14-year sentence in
Beijing, hopes to reach a binding accord in a “reasonable time
to solve the problems Gome is facing,” Zou Xiaochun, a
corporate lawyer for Huang, said yesterday.  Huang, Gome’s largest shareholder, still wants to ensure
the Hong Kong-listed company’s competitiveness, Zou said in an
e-mail exchange. Still, “no substantial conclusion has been
made yet” in discussions with the board and investors, he said.  Last month, Huang failed to convince investors to oust
current Gome Chairman  Chen Xiao  in favor of his own candidate.
In August, Huang said he would end the agreements with the
listed company if shareholders didn’t back him.  Huang wants  Gome  to open stores at a quicker pace and
acquire brands, Zou said Sept. 11.  Suning Appliance Co. , China’s
largest home-appliance retailer, had 1,075 stores as of June 30,
compared with 740 for Gome.  Gome’s shareholders voted in favor of Huang’s proposal last
month to cancel a share-sale mandate in a special general
meeting. His proposals to appoint his sister Huang Yanhong and
his corporate lawyer Zou as executive directors were rejected.  Huang still “hopes to nominate” Zou and his sister as
directors because they worked for Gome for about 10 years, Zou
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
