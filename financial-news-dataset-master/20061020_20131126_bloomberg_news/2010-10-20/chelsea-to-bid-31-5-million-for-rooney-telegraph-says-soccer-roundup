The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Chelsea Bid  Chelsea will offer 20 million pounds ($31.5 million) for
 Wayne Rooney , who wants to leave Manchester United,  the Daily
Telegraph said.   While the bid is far below the 35 million pounds that may
be offered by Manchester City for the forward, Chelsea officials
feel that United coach  Alex Ferguson  would rather the player
move to London than to his cross-town rival, the newspaper said.  Spurs’ Dreams  Tottenham manager  Harry Redknapp  says his club is two
“top, top players” away from contending for the Premier League
title,  the Sun said.   He wants Chairman  Daniel Levy  to give him cash to buy a
central defender and a striker, the newspaper said.  Pastore Not Rushing  Palermo striker Javier Pastore said he’s in no rush to
leave the Italian club even though he’s being linked to
Manchester City, Barcelona and Arsenal,  the Daily Mail said.   The Argentine midfielder has four goals in seven games and
there’s talk of a 35 million-pound transfer to Barcelona,
although the 21-year-old says he wants to stay at Palermo for
two more seasons, the newspaper said.  Hoarau Story  Aston Villa may have to pay as much as 14 million pounds
for Paris St. Germain striker Guillaume Hoarau as a replacement
for  Emile Heskey  or John Carew,  the Daily Mail said .  The France international’s contract was extended through
2013 and his club won’t let him go cheaply, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
