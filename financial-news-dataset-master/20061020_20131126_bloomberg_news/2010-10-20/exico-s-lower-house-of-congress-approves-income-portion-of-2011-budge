Mexico’s lower house of congress
passed the income portion of the 2011 budget, approving a wider
deficit and higher oil price than President  Felipe Calderon 
originally proposed.  In a 354-81 vote, lawmakers the 2011 income law with a
deficit equal to 0.5 percent of gross domestic product and an
estimated oil price of $65.40 per barrel. Calderon on Sept. 8
proposed a deficit of 0.3 percent and estimated oil would sell
for $63 per barrel on average next year.  The widening of the deficit by lawmakers doesn’t worry
investors because the projected 2011 shortfall is smaller than
this year’s and because it’s one of the smallest among the
world’s major economies, said  Luis Flores , an economist at Ixe
Grupo Financiero in Mexico City.  “The deficit is manageable,” Flores said in a telephone
interview. “Mexico is still sending the signal that it’s
reducing the deficit.”  The bill, which now moves to the upper house, must be
approved by Oct. 30. The lower house must agree on the spending
portion of the 2011 budget proposal by Nov. 15.  Comparing Deficits  Mexico’s 2010 budget calls for a deficit of 0.7 percent of
GDP. That compares with a 9.1 percent deficit in the U.S.
through the first half of this year and a 3.4 percent deficit in
Brazil through August.  The lawmakers also raised taxes on cigarettes and set a 25
percent tax on energy drinks such as those sold by Red Bull
GmbH.  The changes approved by the lower house would allow the
government to spend an additional 61 billion pesos ($4.9
billion) next year, which would go toward security and social
programs, Roberto Gil Zuarth, a member of the finance committee
and member of Calderon’s National Action Party, said before the
approval.  Calderon on Sept. 8 proposed total spending of 3.35
trillion pesos for next year, an increase of 2.3 percent in real
terms from 2010 or 5.5 percent in nominal terms.  The budget plan approved by the lawmakers doesn’t include a
reduction in the country’s value-added tax, which had been
sought by the  Institutional Revolutionary Party  and opposed by
Calderon.  The peso rose 1 percent to 12.3988 per dollar at 12:08 p.m.
