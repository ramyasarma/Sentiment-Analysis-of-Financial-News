Canadian wholesale  sales  rose more
than expected in August, recording their biggest gain since
January, because of higher machinery and equipment shipments.  Sales jumped 1.2 percent to C$44.5 billion ($43.2 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists estimated a
0.5 percent increase, based on the median of 10 responses in a
Bloomberg survey.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  yesterday kept the
country’s benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 percent and
said the recovery will be slower than previously predicted.
Carney, who had raised the bank’s rate three times this year,
said the economy will grow 3 percent in 2010, compared with a
July forecast of 3.5 percent.  The wholesale sales figure “will provide a lift to GDP,”
 Krishen Rangasamy , an economist with the Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce in Toronto, said in a note to clients. “Barring an
unexpectedly disastrous reading on Friday for retail sales,
August GDP growth is tracking a decent 0.3 percent.”  The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.4 percent C$1.0297 per
U.S. dollar at 9:14 a.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0336 yesterday.
One Canadian dollar buys 97.12 U.S. cents.  Canada’s  economy expanded  at a 2 percent annualized pace in
the second quarter after growing at a 5.8 percent rate in the
previous three-month period, and shrank for the first time in 11
months in July. Statistics Canada will release August’s GDP
growth figure on Oct. 29, and retail sales for the month on Oct.
22.  Manufacturing Sales  Manufacturing sales rose 2 percent in August, four times
as fast as economists expected, Statistics Canada said on Oct.
15.  Machinery and equipment sales advanced 3.2 percent in
August to C$9.4 billion and sales of “miscellaneous” products
such as paper and agricultural supplies gained 3.4 percent to
C$5.6 billion.  Motor vehicle and parts wholesalers  saw shipments rise by
0.4 percent in the month. Total sales excluding that category
increased 1.4 percent.  Six of seven categories posted gains, while food, beverage
and tobacco sales fell 0.9 percent to C$8.5 billion.  The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the effect of
price changes, rose 0.9 percent, Statistics Canada said. Overall
wholesale sales were 7.5 percent higher in August than the same
month a year earlier, the agency said.  Wholesale inventories dropped 0.3 percent in August to
C$52.9 billion, lowering the inventory-to-sales ratio to 1.19
from 1.21 in July.  Statistics Canada revised its July estimate to no change,
after initially reporting a 0.1 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
