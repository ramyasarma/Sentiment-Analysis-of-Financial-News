Sanford Ltd. , New Zealand’s largest
publicly traded fishing company, had the biggest gain in more
than nine years in Wellington trading after it said full-year
profit exceeded analysts’s forecasts.  Net income totaled about NZ$25 million ($19 million) in the
12 months ended Sept. 30, the Auckland-based company said in a
statement, citing provisional results. Profit fell from NZ$39.1
million a year earlier and exceeded the NZ$15.8 million average
forecast of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The stock
gained 6.8 percent, the most since March 2001.  Sanford’s first-half profit plunged 79 percent as seafood
prices fell and the strengthening New Zealand dollar reduced the
value of export sales. Prices improved for many species and
catch levels increased in the second half, it said today.  Second-half sales increased 14 percent from the year-
earlier period and were NZ$420 million in the full year.  Second-half earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose to NZ$38 million and were NZ$48 million for
the full-year.  Sanford  shares  gained 28 cents to NZ$4.40 at the 5 p.m.
market close in Wellington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
