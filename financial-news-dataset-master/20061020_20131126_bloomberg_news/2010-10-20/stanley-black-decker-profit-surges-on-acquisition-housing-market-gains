Stanley Black & Decker Inc. , the
biggest U.S. toolmaker, more than doubled third-quarter profit
as the housing market began to recover.  Net income rose to $123.2 million, or 73 cents a share, the
New Britain, Connecticut-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding some items, profit was 97 cents, compared
with the 88-cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales  in the construction and do-it-yourself division
almost quadrupled, accounting for more than half the total.
Stanley, which generated almost 60 percent of its revenue from
the U.S. last year, has benefited as housing starts rose the
most since April last month, according to government data.  The company also raised its forecast for earnings per
share, excluding some items, to as much as $3.70 a share.
Analysts on average project $3.59.  Chief Executive Officer  John Lundgren ’s March purchase of
Black & Decker Corp. helped more than double revenue for the
second straight quarter. The merger is expected to yield $125
million in cost savings in 2010, up from the original forecast
of $90 million, the company said. Costs from  acquisitions 
amounted to $22 million in the quarter.  Housing starts climbed to 610,000 in September, the highest
level since April, according to U.S. Commerce Department
figures. That compares with 477,000 new starts in April 2009,
the lowest since records began in 1959. Some U.S. consumers have
shied away from home purchases as they struggle to recover from
the worst recession since the 1930s.  Stanley fell 86 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $61.50 at 10:13
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares
had climbed 21 percent this year before today, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 4.6 percent.  Total  sales  rose to $2.37 billion last quarter, from
$935.5 million a year ago. In the year-earlier period, profit
was $60.4 million, or 75 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
