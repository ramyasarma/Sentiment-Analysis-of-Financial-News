Investors should avoid stocks that
are dependent on the economy as the government seeks to cool

investors rotate to companies whose profitability is
less affected by the economy, said Zhao Zifeng, who helps
oversee about $10.2 billion at China International Fund.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
