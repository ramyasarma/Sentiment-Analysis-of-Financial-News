Eurocopter SA , the world’s largest
maker of helicopters, expects India sales of more than 100
million euros ($140 million) by 2015, helped by demand for
offshore and luxury transportation.  The company also plans to open an engineering center in
Bangalore next year, Eurocopter’s India head Marie-Agnes Veve
told reporters in New Delhi today at an event to mark the
formation of an India unit. She didn’t give a revenue forecast
for this year.  The  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.  unit expects
to sell 20 civilian helicopters in India this year and is
bidding to supply military ones, Veve said, without elaboration.
The nation’s helicopter market has been growing 20 percent a
year, according to the company, stoked by rising wealth in
Asia’s second-fastest growing major economy.  Eurocopter plans to set up repair facilities across India
with government-owned Pawan Hans Helicopter Ltd. and Hindustan
Aeronautics Ltd., it said. The company expects to have a 50
percent share of India’s civilian and public-sector helicopter
market by 2015, Veve said.  The helicopter manufacturer is  EADS ’s third-largest unit by
sales, after top-ranked Airbus SAS, the world’s biggest maker of
commercial aircraft, and the defense and security division,
which makes missiles, combat planes and military electronics.  To contact the reporters on this story:
