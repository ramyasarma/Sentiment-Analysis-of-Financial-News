Nobel Prize-winning economist  Paul Krugman  said China is headed for a “trade conflict” with the
U.S. and other western countries as tensions rise about how to
rebalance the global economy.  “What China is doing is functionally equivalent to having
large export subsidies and large import tariffs,” Krugman, 57,
said in a speech in the Free University in Berlin. “If it were
doing that in the normal way, it would automatically be subject
to large countervailing duties. And I think that’s going to
happen at the rate we’re going.”  China is facing mounting pressure from major trading
partners for a stronger yuan, with U.S. and European officials
arguing that the currency is undervalued. Some executives are
also complaining about Chinese trade barriers. U.S. steelmakers,
working to block Chinese investments such as a planned venture
by Anshan Iron & Steel Group in Mississippi, on Oct. 14 produced
a report saying companies in China get illegal subsidies.  Sinofert Buys Potash  Sinofert Holdings Ltd ., 22 percent held by  Potash Corp . of
Saskatchewan, said it signed an agreement for the purchase of
Canadian potash from Canpotex Ltd., a venture 33.3 percent owned
by its shareholder.  The accord, which must be disclosed because it’s between
connected parties, caps annual buying at $600 million next year,
$730 million in 2012 and $870 million in 2013, Hong Kong-based
Sinofert said in a filing to the city’s stock exchange.  The deal is exclusive; Sinochem Macao will purchase
Canadian potash solely from Canpotex, and Canpotex won’t sell to
any other buyers in China, Sinofert said. The agreement is
subject to shareholder approval.  TAL Soars on Debut  TAL Education Group , which offers after-school tutoring
services in China, raised $120 million after pricing its initial
public offering at the top of its forecast range. The shares
rallied 50 percent.  The Beijing-based company sold 12 million American
depositary receipts for $10 each after offering them at $8 to
$10 apiece, according to a  filing  with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and a statement. TAL Education climbed  $5  to
$15 in New York Stock Exchange trading.  Vegetable Oil Sale  China, the world’s biggest soybean buyer, may sell more
vegetable oils from stockpiles if prices rise more after
yesterday’s auction of 300,000 metric tons rapeseed oil, portal
Cnyouzhi.com said.  The sale, which offloaded almost the entire volume on offer,
was a display of the government’s “determination and
capability” to control the market, the industry watcher said on
its website. It may cool the market’s near-term bullishness and
also curb gains in soybean oil, it said.  MARKETS:  The dollar slid the most against the euro since July and
