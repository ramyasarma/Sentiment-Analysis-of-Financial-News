Graco Children’s Products Inc., a
unit of  Newell Rubbermaid Inc. , is recalling about 2 million
strollers after reports of infant strangulation, the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission said.  The CPSC received reports of four deaths of babies from
2003 through 2005 in the Graco Quattro Tour and MetroLite model
strollers, according to a statement today. Accidents can occur,
especially for infants under a year old, when they are
unstrapped and their heads become wedged between the stroller
tray and seat bottom, the agency said.  The recall involves versions of the Quattro Tour made
before November 2006 and the MetroLite model manufactured before
July 2007, the CPSC said. The models can be used safely as an
infant auto seat, the agency said, because there isn’t a space
gap in the car, the agency said. Strollers made after January
2008, when new industry design rules took effect, have larger
openings that avoid trapping or strangling an infant, the agency
said.  Retailers including  Sears Holdings Corp. ,  Toys R Us Inc. 
and  Target Corp.  sold the strollers from November 2000 through
December 2007, the agency said. Consumers should stop using the
recalled models and contact Graco for a free repair kit at
1-877-828-4046 or on the website  www.gracobaby.com , the CPSC
said.  In March, Graco recalled 1.2 million high chairs because
screws can loosen in the legs. That action was prompted by 464
incident reports, including 24 injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
