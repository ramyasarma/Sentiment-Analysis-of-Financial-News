Japanese  stocks  fell, dragging down
the Nikkei 225 Stock Average by the most in a week, after China
unexpectedly raised interest rates to curb inflation in the
world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, slid 1.3
percent. Fanuc Ltd., a maker of industrial robots, fell 2
percent. Mitsui & Co., a trading company that counts commodities
as its biggest source of profit, sank 2.7 percent and Inpex
Corp., Japan’s largest oil and gas explorer, dropped 3.4 percent
after oil and metal prices tumbled.  “Investors are concerned China’s higher rates will likely
work against company earnings,” said  Hisakazu Amano , who helps
oversee about $29 billion at Tokyo-based T&D Asset Management Co.
“Slowing economic growth in China and emerging countries will
likely reduce demand related to raw materials.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 1.7 percent to 9,381.60
at the close in Tokyo, the biggest drop since Oct. 12 and the
largest slump among major equity indexes in the Asia-Pacific
region. The broader Topix lost 1.2 percent to 823.69, with more
than six times as many shares declining as advancing.  The Nikkei 225 has decreased 11 percent this year, the most
among the world’s 40 largest equity markets. Shares in the index
traded at 16.7 times estimated earnings on average yesterday,
near their highest level since August.  China’s central bank raised one-year lending and  deposit
rates  by 25 basis points yesterday, boosting borrowing costs for
the first time since 2007. Policy makers are trying to curb
lending and prevent an asset-price bubble.  G-20 Meeting  The move comes days before finance ministers and central
bankers from the Group of 20 countries gather in South Korea to
discuss the global economy amid disagreements on whether the
yuan is undervalued.  Toyota, an automaker that earns about 70 percent of its
revenue abroad, slid 1.3 percent to 2,888 yen and was the
 biggest single drag  on the Topix among its 1,662 companies,
followed by  Canon Inc.  and Honda Motor Co. Canon, the world’s
biggest camera maker, sank 2 percent and Honda, a carmaker that
get more than 80 percent of their sales overseas, fell 1.6
percent. Fanuc lost 2 percent to 11,190 yen, the heaviest drag
on the Nikkei 225.  “A slowdown in the Chinese economy may slow the speed of
recovery in the global economy,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an
equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  Japanese stocks have fallen this year on concern the
strengthening yen will reduce earnings at exporters. Europe’s
debt crisis, China’s steps to curb property prices and concern
about the pace of U.S. economic growth further eroded confidence
in a global recovery.  Yen Hurts Exporters  The yen traded near a one-month high against the euro as
China’s move stoked concern about global economic growth. The
currency strengthened to as high as 111.56 today in Tokyo,
compared with 113.37 per euro at the close of stock trading
yesterday. Against the dollar, it appreciated to 81.32 from
81.53. A higher yen cuts overseas income at Japanese companies
when converted into their home currency.  The yen is headed for its strongest annual average level
against the dollar since currencies began trading freely in 1971,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on each day’s
closing price.  Mining and oil-drilling companies had the steepest
percentage drop among the Topix’s 33 industry groups, followed
by trading houses.  Inpex sank 3.4 percent to 432,000 yen and Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co., the nation’s second-largest oil explorer, fell
2.3 percent to 3,255 yen. Mitsui lost 2.7 percent to 1,293 yen.
 Mitsubishi Corp. , Japan’s biggest commodities trader, fell 2.4
percent to 2,000 yen.  Crude oil for November delivery sank 4.3 percent to settle
at $79.49 a barrel yesterday in New York, the steepest drop
since Feb. 4, on concern the rate increase in China will crimp
demand in the world’s biggest energy-using country.  The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including
aluminum and copper lost 2.1 percent yesterday, the largest
decline since Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter for this story:
