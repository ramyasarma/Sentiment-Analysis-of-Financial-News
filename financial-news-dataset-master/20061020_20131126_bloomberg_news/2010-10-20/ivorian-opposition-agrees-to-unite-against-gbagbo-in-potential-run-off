Ivory Coast  opposition presidential
candidates have pledged to support each other against President
 Laurent Gbagbo  in a run-off election if no one wins enough votes
in the Oct. 31 first round.  “We have decided to collaborate in an alliance against the
incumbent, to make sure that one of our candidates wins this
election,” said Thiemele Amoakon-Edjampan, vice president of the
Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, which has  Henri Konan Bedie  as
its candidate.  If the opposition candidate wins “we will have a common
government program at the ready,” he said in a phone interview
from the commercial capital, Abidjan, yesterday. He declined to
offer further details.  Gbagbo has ruled Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa
producer, for a decade. His mandate expired in 2005 but attempts
to hold polls were delayed at least six times amid disputes over
the voters’ roll.  The agreement is meant to “reaffirm our commitment to
govern together,” said Anne Ouloto, spokeswoman for Rally of
Republicans candidate  Alassane Ouattara , a former prime minister
of the West African nation. Ouloto said two other candidates
have also pledged their support to the plan.  Ivory Coast, a crude exporter and Africa’s third-largest
coffee grower, has been divided into a government-controled
north and rebel-held south since a military uprising in 2002.  On Oct. 15, Reuters published a poll conducted by TNS
Sofres that projected Gbagbo would win 46 percent of the first-
round vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
