Individual investors are removing
money from U.S. stocks during a rally at an unprecedented rate,
a sign the gain will lose momentum because of a “buyers’
strike,” according to LPL Financial Corp.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that for the first time in a
quarter century, a three-month gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index failed to drive inflows into U.S. mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
and  Jeffrey Kleintop , chief market strategist at LPL in Boston.  “While individuals may have overcome to some degree their
distrust of the durability of the economic recovery and policy
makers in Washington, they remain distrustful of the integrity
of the U.S. stock market,” Kleintop wrote in a note dated
yesterday. “Without the return of the individual investor to
the U.S. stock market, further gains in the current rally may be
hard to come by.”  Individuals shunned equities in favor of bonds following
the 2008 financial crisis. The selling picked up again after May
6, when a 20-minute plunge briefly erased $862 billion from the
value of U.S. equities. About $45 billion has been withdrawn
from U.S. mutual funds since the end of June while about $94
billion was added to debt funds, according to data compiled by
the Washington-based Investment Company Institute. At the same
time, the S&P 500 has climbed 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
