The Japanese government’s new
formula to measure consumer prices may push down the index by
0.4 percentage point, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The statistics bureau will change the way it calculates the
figures in August 2011. Some 28 goods and services that have
increased in importance, such as music downloading fees,
electronic dictionaries and fried chicken, will be added to the
basket of goods, according to the bureau’s plans. Dried sardines
and express mail are among the 22 that will be removed because
of decreased significance.  The Bank of Japan, which said this month that price
declines will continue to narrow, is unlikely to adjust its
assessment of deflation because of the formula adjustment,
 Chiwoong Lee , a Tokyo-based economist at Goldman Sachs, said in
a report today. Even so, continuing deflation and a
deteriorating economy is likely to prompt the central bank to
expand the 5 trillion yen asset-purchasing fund ($62 billion) to
20 trillion yen by the end of next year, Lee said.  Consumer prices excluding fresh food , the central bank’s
preferred gauge of inflation, slumped for an 18th month in
August. The statistics bureau revises its calculations every
five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
