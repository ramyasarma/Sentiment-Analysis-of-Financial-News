Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. ,
the world’s largest dairy exporter, has agreed to develop a
dairy farm in China’s Yutian County as it seeks to expand its
local milk production.  The farm, which is in Hebei Province, will house 3,000 cows
imported from New Zealand, the Auckland-based company said in a
statement. Fonterra plans a NZ$42 million investment in the
project, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
