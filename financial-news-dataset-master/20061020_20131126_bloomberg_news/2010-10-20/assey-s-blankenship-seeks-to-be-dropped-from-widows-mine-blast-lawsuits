Don Blankenship, chief executive
officer of Massey Energy Co., isn’t personally responsible for
the April explosion that killed 29 miners at its Performance
Coal unit and should be dropped from two widows’ lawsuits, his
lawyer argued in court.  A top executive can’t be sued for a company’s wrongful acts
“simply because of his status as an officer,” the CEO’s
lawyers said in court papers. Attorneys for Massey and the women
are making arguments today before a state-court judge in
Madison, West Virginia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
