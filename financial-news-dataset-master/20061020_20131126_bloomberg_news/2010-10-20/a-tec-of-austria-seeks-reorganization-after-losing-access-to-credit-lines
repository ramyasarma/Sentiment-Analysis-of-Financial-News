A-Tec Industries AG , an Austrian
engineering company, sought court clearance to reorganize debt
after losing access to its line of credit because of an
Australian power-station project’s financial difficulties.  A-Tec filed for self-administered reorganization
proceedings at the Vienna Commercial Court and has appointed
trustees for bondholders, the company said today in a statement.
A-Tec has 90 days under  Austrian law  to seek an agreement with
lenders, after which it can seek full protection from creditors.  The  company , which is based in Vienna, has a 798 million-
euro ($1.11 billion) revolving credit facility and 302 million
euros of outstanding bonds, according to Bloomberg data. A-Tec
forecast a full-year operating loss on Oct. 14 because of cost
overruns on an Australian power station project.  Citic Pacific Ltd ., an arm of China’s biggest state-owned
investment company, ended an agreement on Oct. 18 with an A-Tec
unit to build an electricity-generating station at a $5.2
billion iron-ore project in Western Australia. The Austrian
company hasn’t disclosed details of its Australian operations’
finances.  Trading in A-Tec shares was suspended earlier today in
advance of the announcement. The stock has  fallen  34 percent
this year, valuing the manufacturer at 151.8 million euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
