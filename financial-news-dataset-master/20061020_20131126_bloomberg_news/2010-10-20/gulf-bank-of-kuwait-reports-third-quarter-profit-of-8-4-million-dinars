Gulf Bank KSC  posted a nine-month
profit, after a year-earlier loss, as the Kuwaiti lender
benefited from improved loan and investment portfolios and
better market conditions.  Net income for the first nine months was 10.4 million
dinars ($37 million), compared with a loss of 7 million dinars
last year, Gulf Bank said today in an e-mailed statement. Third-
quarter net income rose to 8.4 million dinars, from a 469,000-
dinar profit in 2009.  “I expect every quarter to be better than the last,”
Chief Executive Officer  Michel Accad  said in a phone interview
after the results were released. “This is a good sense of what
the future will look like.”  Banks in the region are trying to recover from the worst
economic crisis since the 1930s, which crimped lending, weakened
capital-market activity and increased loan defaults. Kuwait was
forced to guarantee all deposits at local banks in 2008 after
Gulf Bank lost $1.3 billion in derivatives trading and  Global
Investment House KSCC , the country’s biggest investment bank,
defaulted on $2.8 billion of debt.  The results “mirror the bank’s conservative policy of
taking the general provisions to a higher level to secure a
strong financial position for the bank and enhance its expansion
and growth potential,” Chairman  Ali Al-Rashaid Al-Bader  said in
the statement.  Gulf Bank shares fell 1.9 percent to 520 fils at the close
in Kuwait today before the results were announced. The stock has
gained 73 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
