Codelco, the world’s biggest copper
producer, hired Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings Plc to manage
its first dollar bond sale in 21 months, according to a person
familiar with the transaction.  The state-owned company that led the rescue of 33 miners
trapped below Chile’s Atacama Desert will sell the bonds after
meeting with investors in London and U.S. cities through Oct.
27, said the person, who declined to be identified because terms
aren’t set. The yield on Codelco notes maturing 2019 fell to
3.62 percent today from 5.05 percent at the end of 2009.  Chilean banks and companies have sold $2.1 billion of bonds
in dollars, more than in 2007 and 2008 combined, since the
government achieved the lowest yield in its history on a July
sale of $1 billion in 10-year bonds, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Codelco last sold dollar bonds in January 2009.  “It’ll come out very tight, like we saw with Chile and
other Chilean deals,” said  Francisca Silva , a broker at
Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago who buys bonds in
dollars for Chilean investors. “There was lots of demand for
the other Chilean deals.”  Codelco wants to invest $15 billion over the next five
years in its Andina, El Teniente and Norte divisions in Chile as
it fights declining output at its century-old Chuquicamata mine,
Chief Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez  said Sept. 29.  Maturities  The state miner plans to raise $1.8 billion in local and
international debt in maturities of up to 30 years, it said in
an Oct. 1 statement on the Chilean securities regulator’s
website. Mexico, which has lower-rated debt than Codelco, on
Oct. 5 sold bonds due in 100 years at a yield of 6.1 percent.  Codelco’s $600 million of 7.5 percent bonds due in 2019
yield 153 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield jumped to 5.37 percent in the wake of the 8.8-
magnitude earthquake that smashed a swathe of Chile on Feb. 27.
Codelco maintained its annual production forecast after the
earthquake.  The yield on Chile’s 10-year sovereign dollar bonds fell to
3.31 percent today from 3.77 percent on July 30, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Empresa Nacional del Petroleo, Chile’s state-owned oil
refiner known as Enap, sold $500 million of bonds in August that
pay 214 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries. Banco del Estado
de Chile sold $500 million of 10-year notes on Sept. 30 while
Banco Santander Chile sold $700 million of bonds in two parts on
Sept. 15, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Codelco’s bonds in dollars
A1, the fifth-highest investment grade and one level below the
government. Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings grade Codelco A.  Ratings  Chile has the highest credit ratings in Latin America and
ranks alongside Austria in the credit-default swaps market.
Chile’s five-year credit-default swap spreads rose to 71 basis
points today from a nine-month low of 61 basis points on Oct.
13, according to prices from CMA Datavision in New York. A basis
point on a credit-default swap protecting $10 million of debt
from default for five years is equivalent to $1,000 a year.  Codelco provided more than 100 engineers and other staff
and a budget of $15 million for the two-month mine rescue
operation that concluded last week. The rescue was directed by
Andre Sougarret, the manager of the El Teniente mine.  The price of copper reached a 27-month high earlier this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
