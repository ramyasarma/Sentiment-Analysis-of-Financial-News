Investors should buy European stocks
while the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index remains above key
support levels and after China raised interest rates, according
to Mint Equities’ head of technical research.  The Stoxx 600, which closed at 265.24 yesterday, is trading
above two key support levels at 265 and 263.2, according to
Mint’s  Geoff Wilkinson . The decision yesterday by the People’s
Bank of China to raise one-year lending and deposit rates by 25
basis points adds to encouraging technical levels, pushing
investors in favor of buying shares, Wilkinson said.  “From a technical perspective at least, the case for
buying the dips is well made,” London-based Wilkinson said in a
telephone interview today. “You have a lot of reasons why even
if we break down, we are going to see some buying interest
coming in. If China is actually putting rates up because it
wants to grow, that’s a good thing isn’t it?”  Concern that the rate of expansion of the Chinese economy
was slowing contributed to a 1.6 percent slide in the Stoxx 600
in August. The gauge climbed to the highest level since April on
Oct. 18 and has rallied 5.6 percent since the end of August amid
optimism that the U.S. Federal Reserve will add to stimulus
measures to buoy the faltering economic recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
