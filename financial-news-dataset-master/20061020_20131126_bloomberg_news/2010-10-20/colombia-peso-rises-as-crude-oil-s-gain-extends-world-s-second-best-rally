Colombia’s peso strengthened for the
first time in seven days as crude oil rose, extending the
currency’s rally.  The peso increased 0.4 percent to 1,809.25 per dollar at 3
p.m. New York time, from 1,815.85 yesterday. The currency has
jumped 13 percent this year, the second-best performance among
all currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind Japan’s yen.  “Colombia is still pretty much a strong commodity story,
an oil story,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , a strategist at
RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut.  Oil for December delivery gained 2.9 percent to $81.77 a
barrel in New York.  The central bank modified the rules on how it
“intervenes” in the market last week, allowing it to more
easily buy dollars.  “The focus right now is on potential controls of
capital,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an economist with Wells Fargo &
Co. in New York. “Everybody is expecting a package of measures.
The Colombians are getting hammered and they need to maintain
the currency.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due
2020 fell 6 basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.99
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price climbed 0.514 centavo to 127.629 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
