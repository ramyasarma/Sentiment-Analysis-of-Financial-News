BNP Paribas SA , France’s largest
bank, hired  Achim Klueber  to head its Corporate & Transaction
Banking Europe unit in Germany as the lender seeks to expand the
business in the country.  BNP Paribas will target “large midcap” corporate clients
in Germany, with annual revenue of at least 1 billion euros
($1.38 billion) and export-driven businesses that may benefit
from the bank’s international network, country head  Joachim von Schorlemer  said at a press briefing in Frankfurt today.  Klueber joins from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, where
he was responsible for Germany, Austria and Switzerland from
2001 to 2008, and most recently was managing director of
business development in Europe. He will start in the newly
created role at BNP Paribas on Dec. 1.  The Paris-based lender plans to grow its staff in corporate
and investment banking in Germany to about 400 to 450 by mid-
2011, from about 340 today. The biggest economy in Europe is an
important market for BNP Paribas because of its “strong
industry,” von Schorlemer said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
