The Deepwater Horizon oil rig
explosion in the Gulf of Mexico could result in insured losses
of as much as $6 billion, according to Fitch Ratings Ltd.  The explosion was “a material event for the reinsurance
sector,”  Chris Waterman , a managing director with Fitch, said
today during a presentation in Zurich.  Even though BP Plc, which didn’t buy insurance, will cover
the majority of expenses linked to the clean-up, the disaster
may cost insurers between $4 billion and $6 billion, Waterman
said. The total economic loss is $35 billion, he said.  Swiss Reinsurance Co. , the world’s second largest
reinsurer, estimated insured losses in June to be as much as
$3.5 billion, making it the biggest man-made insurance loss
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York. Insurers are
charging 50 percent more for policies covering oil rigs after
the explosion in April triggered the worst spill in U.S.
history, Moody’s Investors Service said on June 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
