TerreStar Networks Inc., a satellite
mobile-communications company, won court approval to begin
borrowing from  EchoStar Corp. , the telecommunications company
financing TerreStar’s bankruptcy restructuring.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Sean Lane  in Manhattan today approved
an order allowing TerreStar, a unit of  TerreStar Corp. , to
borrow as much as $18 million of a $75 million loan from
EchoStar. TerreStar will return to court in November for
permission to borrow the remainder.  TerreStar, based in Reston, Virginia, was in court after
filing for bankruptcy yesterday to reduce its $1.6 billion debt.
The company provides mobile satellite coverage throughout the
U.S. and Canada in areas where traditional mobile networks are
unavailable, according to court papers.  Arik Preis, an attorney for TerreStar, told Lane at today’s
hearing that it has taken years for TerreStar to build its
satellite network with “very little revenue produced.”  “This company is in dire need of liquidity,” Preis said.  The company warned in a regulatory filing in August that it
might have to file for bankruptcy.  EchoStar, a television equipment and satellite services
company, and New York hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners are
TerreStar Corp.’s largest  shareholders , according to Bloomberg
data.  EchoStar , based in Englewood, Colorado, has agreed to
support a restructuring plan in which it and other secured
noteholders would swap their debt for equity, according to court
papers. EchoStar would also backstop $100 million of a
$125 million rights offering under the plan.  The case is In re TerreStar Networks Inc., 10-15446, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
