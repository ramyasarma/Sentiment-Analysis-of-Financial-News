New Jersey , the U.S. state with the
second-highest per capita income, lost 20,200 nonfarm jobs in
September, led by a 7,600 drop in local government positions
including teachers, the state labor department said.  Nongovernment employers trimmed 9,400 jobs last month, the
labor department  said  today, citing preliminary estimates.
Businesses in the state have cut a net 3,900 jobs this year
through September, compared with 108,400 a year earlier, the
figures show.  New Jersey lost 1,100 jobs in August, according to revised
data, erasing a preliminary estimate for an increase of 500, the
department said.  The state’s  unemployment rate  declined to 9.4 percent from
9.6 percent in August, mostly because people left the labor
force, the department said. That’s the lowest jobless level
since June 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the
past 12 months, the state’s civilian labor force shrank by
34,400, according to the report.  Industry groups with the biggest estimated employment
losses last month were educational services, down 5,400, and
professional and business services, which dropped 4,500, the
state said. Manufacturers increased the most, adding 1,800 jobs.  Government employers shed 10,800 positions, including 2,900
at the federal level as temporary Census workers ended their
service, the Labor Department said.  Construction and the trade, transportation and utilities
groups, which have been in the news as Governor  Chris Christie 
considers whether to proceed with an $8.7 billion trans-Hudson
tunnel project, lost 3,500 jobs in September, the state said.
Earlier this month, Christie halted work on the tunnel, the
largest infrastructure-construction project in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
