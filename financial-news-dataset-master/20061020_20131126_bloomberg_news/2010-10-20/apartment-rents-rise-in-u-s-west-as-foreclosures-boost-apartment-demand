Apartment rents rose across the U.S.
West and South for the third straight quarter as record
foreclosures boosted demand for rental housing, RealFacts said.  The average asking rent climbed to $958 a month from $950
in the second quarter, according to a report released today by
the Novato, California-based  research company . It declined 0.7
percent from a year earlier. Rents reached a record $1,002 in
the third quarter of 2008.  “We’re getting to be much more of a culture that puts a
premium on rental housing,” Sarah Bridge, owner of RealFacts,
said in an interview. “People are disillusioned with the
housing market. They don’t want to spend their money that way if
they’re going to be foreclosed on.”  Sales of properties in the foreclosure process accounted
for almost a third of U.S. transactions in September and
surpassed 100,000 for the first time, RealtyTrac Inc. said on
Oct. 14. The data provider’s figures go back to 2005.  Apartment rents rose fastest in the Denver area, with rates
increasing 2.4 percent from the second quarter to $883 a month,
followed by the Austin, Texas, region, with a 2.3 gain to $837 a
month, RealFacts said. In the Atlanta area, rents rose 2.2
percent to $834, and in the San Jose, California, region they
increased 1.9 percent to $1,587.  The San Jose area, which encompasses Sunnyvale and Santa
Clara, was the priciest region in RealFacts’ database in the
third quarter.  Apartments were 92.8 percent occupied, up from 92 percent
in the second quarter and 91.7 percent a year earlier, according
to RealFacts.  “It seems the apartment sector is outperforming the
economy in general,” Bridge said.  The survey covers 3.29 million rental units in states
including California, Florida, Indiana,  Arizona , Texas, Colorado
and Nevada. Closely held RealFacts surveys apartment owners
quarterly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
