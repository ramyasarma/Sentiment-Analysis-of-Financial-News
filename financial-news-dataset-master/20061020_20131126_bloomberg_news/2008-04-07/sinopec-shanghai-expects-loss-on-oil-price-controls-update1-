             Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Co. (338) ,
China's largest ethylene maker, said it expects a first-quarter
loss because of oil costs and government price controls.  
 Strict state controls caused ``a severe mismatch between
petroleum product prices and crude oil prices,'' the company
said in a statement to Hong Kong's stock exchange today. It will
disclose its results on April 28.  
 The Chinese government caps the price of fuels to limit
their impact on inflation, which reached 8.7 percent in February,
the fastest pace in 11 years. Fuel producers get subsidies from
the government as compensation.  
 In the first quarter, the company, a unit of  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , got a subsidy of 247.3 million  yuan 
($35 million), it said.  
 Sinopec Shanghai posted a profit of 1.07 billion yuan in
last year's first quarter, the company said, citing domestic
accounting standards.  
 Full-year profit almost doubled in 2007 from a year earlier,
the company reported today.
