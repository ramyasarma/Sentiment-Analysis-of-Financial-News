The National Football League is
looking into the U.S. Army’s discovery of a blood test to
diagnose hard-to-detect concussions.  NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  and the co-chairs of the
league’s Head, Neck and Spine Committee met last week with Gen.
 Peter Chiarelli , the Army vice chief of staff, at the Seattle
Seahawks’ offices to discuss the research, league spokesman  Greg Aiello  said yesterday in an e-mail.  More than 300,000 U.S. athletes lose consciousness each
year from what may be as many as 3.8 million concussions,
according to a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
study published in 2007. The league is trying to educate its
players about the possibility of permanent brain damage from
concussions that aren’t allowed to heal.  “At General Chiarelli’s invitation, Commissioner Goodell
plans on touring the Army’s research facilities with the general
at some point in the near future,” Aiello said.  The test detects unique proteins that enter the blood
stream from damaged brain cells, Army Colonel Dallas Hack told
USA Today. The test still needs approval by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration.  To contact the reporters on this story:
