European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said he’s “completely against” changing
the euro-area’s inflation target and that he doesn’t believe any
major central bank is preparing to change its definition of
price stability.  “No central bank finds it appropriate to raise inflation
at present,” Trichet said today at the World Policy  Conference
in Marrakech. He was responding to a question about the plans of
the U.S. Federal Reserve. Raising the ECB’s 2 percent target
would have “disastrous consequences” for inflation
expectations and would increase volatility, he said.  Trichet said also said that governments need to run
balanced budgets in the medium term to boost confidence among
businesses and consumers. “The recovery comes from
confidence,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
