Empresas Copec SA  said it may seek
to buy control of  Proenergia Internacional SA  to expand in
Colombia’s fuel distribution market.  Santiago-based Copec this year bought AEI Colombia Holdings
Ltd. and AEI Colombia Investments Ltd., which in turn own
already own about 47 percent of Proenergia, according to a
letter dated Sept. 20 to Proenergia shareholders from Copec. The
letter was posted yesterday on the  website  of Colombia’s
securities regulator.  Proenergia, through a holding company, controls Colombian
fuel distributor Organizacion Terpel SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
