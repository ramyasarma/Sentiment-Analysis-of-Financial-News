Fewers bankers are leaving the U.K.
because of tax increases than some tax advisers initially
estimated, the  Financial Times  reported.  Even after the U.K. imposed a 50 percent tax on income
above 150,000 pounds ($240,000) a year, the net earnings gap
between London and other financial centers may not be wide
enough to cause middle-ranking bankers to leave, the newspaper
said, citing research by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  A married banker earning 250,000 pounds with two children,
one under six years old, and a 750,000-pound mortgage would be
left with 141,000 pounds after tax in London, the FT said,
citing PwC.  In comparison, they would earn 150,000 pounds in Paris,
156,000 pounds in Geneva and 145,000 pounds in New York,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
