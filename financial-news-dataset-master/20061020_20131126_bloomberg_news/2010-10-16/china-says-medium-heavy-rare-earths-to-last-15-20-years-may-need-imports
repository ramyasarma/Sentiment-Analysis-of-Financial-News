China’s medium and heavy rare earths
reserves may only last 15-20 years at the current rate of
production needs, Chao Ning, section chief of foreign trade at
the Ministry of Commerce, said today at a conference.  “We can not rule out the possibility that China may need
to rely on imports sometime in the future for these minerals,
instead of supplying the world,” Chao said.  China’s rare earths deposits dropped to 27 million tons by
the end of 2009, or just 30 percent of the world’s total known
reserves, from 43 million tons, or 43 percent of the world
total, in 1996, Chao said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
