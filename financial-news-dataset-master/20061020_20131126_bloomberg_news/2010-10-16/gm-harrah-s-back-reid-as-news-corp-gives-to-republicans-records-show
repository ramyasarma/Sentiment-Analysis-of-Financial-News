Two Las Vegas casino companies
helped fund a political action committee running ads in support
of Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  while  Rupert Murdoch ’s News
Corp. gave an additional $250,000 to the  Republican Governors
Association , according to campaign-finance reports.  The  Federal Election Commission  and Internal Revenue
Service reports were filed Oct. 15 on contributions made between
July and September.  Harrah’s Entertainment Inc.  contributed $75,000 and  MGM
Resorts International  gave $50,000 to  Patriot Majority  PAC, one
of the new “super PACs” that can take in unlimited donations
for spending that’s independent of candidates’ campaigns, FEC
reports show. Between Sept. 1 and Oct. 12, Patriot Majority PAC
and a related group spent $1.1 million to help reelect Reid, a
Democrat who is in a tight race for his Nevada seat.  Sheldon Adelson , chairman of  Las Vegas Sands Corp. , gave $1
million to the Republican governors group, which reported
raising $31 million between July and September and $89 million
since Jan. 1, 2009, according to the IRS. New York-based  News
Corp. , which gave $1 million to the Republican group in June,
contributed $250,000 in July.  The  Democratic Governors Association  raised $10 million,
including $700,000 from the  American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees , during the last three months, and $50
million since Jan. 1, 2009, according to the IRS. There are 37
governors’ races on the Nov. 2 ballot.  Union Donations  FEC filings show that Democratic-leaning PACs raised much
of their money from labor unions and long-time Democratic
donors. The  American Federation of Teachers  gave $400,000 to the
Commonsense Ten PAC and $300,000 to Patriot Majority PAC.  Fred Eychaner , owner of Chicago-based Newsweb Corp., who
has given $554,000 to Democratic political committees for the
2010 elections, contributed $200,000 to the  America’s Families
First Action Fund . The  International Association of Firefighters 
gave $500,000 to the group.  The  League of Conservation Voters  raised $314,985 for its
super PAC, including $90,000 from  David Bonderman , who runs the
TPG Capital hedge fund. TPG is based in Fort Worth, Texas.  American Crossroads , the PAC advised by  Karl Rove , doesn’t
file its next FEC report until next week. Most of the top-
spending Republican-leaning groups, including Rove’s  Crossroads
GPS , are incorporated under a section of the tax code that
allows them to shield their donors.  Republican-leaning groups spent about $73 million from
Sept. 1 to Oct. 12, four times as much as Democratic-leaning
organizations. That has made up for the Republican Party’s
shortfall in fundraising. Democratic House and Senate
fundraising committees reported $67 million in the bank as of
Oct. 1, while Senate and House Republicans reported $38 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
