Axa Private Equity is considering
buying a stake in KOS SpA, Il Sole 24 Ore reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Axa Private Equity is studying whether to acquire 16.4
percent owned by Morgan Stanley in  Compagnie Industriale Riunite
SpA ’s health-services unit, plus 6.8 percent and 9.6 percent
owned by Wise and Santo Stefano Partecipazioni respectively, the
newspaper reported in its weekly Plus24 supplement.  KOS’s shareholders are holding talks with other private
equity funds to sell 49 percent of the company, Il Sole said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
