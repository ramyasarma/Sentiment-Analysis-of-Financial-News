Gulf Finance House EC , the Bahrain-
based investment bank, is to hold a general meeting for
shareholders to approve its recapitalization plan.  “Shareholders will be asked to approve the four to one
consolidation of shares, a reduction in paid up capital and the
issuance of an equity linked convertible Murabaha of up to $500
million,” the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
GFH said it has requested that its shares be suspended from
trading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
