Alan Krueger , the U.S. Treasury
Department’s chief economist, is leaving the post next month to
return to Princeton University.  Krueger, 50, the Treasury’s assistant secretary for
economic policy, is going back to Princeton because his two-year
leave of absence from the university is ending, Treasury
spokeswoman Sandra Salstrom said in an e-mail today.  Krueger is the latest Obama administration economic
official to return to academia.  Lawrence Summers , director of
the president’s National Economic Council, is scheduled to leave
for Harvard University by the end of the year.  Christina Romer ,
who headed the Council of Economic Advisers, left in September
for the University of California at Berkeley.  Krueger focused much of his attention on U.S.  unemployment ,
which remained at 9.6 percent in September. The Federal Reserve
Bank has signaled it will take action at its Nov. 2-3 meeting to
try to stimulate demand and create jobs.  Krueger said Oct. 8 that the “challenges of long-term
unemployment remain a particular concern.” Krueger’s plans were
reported yesterday by the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
