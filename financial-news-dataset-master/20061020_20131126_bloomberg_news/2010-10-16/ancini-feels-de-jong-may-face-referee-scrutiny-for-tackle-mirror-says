Manchester City manager Roberto
Mancini warned Nigel De Jong he faces scrutiny from referees
following his leg-breaking tackle on Newcastle’s Hatem Ben Arfa,
the Daily Mirror said.  De Jong plays his first game tomorrow since his challenge
two weeks ago left Ben Arfa with a double fracture. The
midfielder didn’t receive a card from the referee and Mancini
feels he could be a marked man.  “He must pay attention in the next two or three games
because referees could see him in a different way,” the Mirror
quoted Mancini as saying. “He is a hard but honest player. I
think it was very unlucky, what happened to Ben Arfa, because if
was a normal tackle.”  City, which is second in the Premier League behind Chelsea,
visits Blackpool tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
