Australians should consider leaving
Yemen as terrorist attacks are likely and could occur at any
time, the government in Canberra said, raising its travel
advisory for the Middle Eastern country to its highest level.  “We advise you not to travel to Yemen at this time because
of the very high threat of terrorist attack and volatile
security situation,” the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade said in a  statement  posted on its website late yesterday.  The increased threat of terrorism follows an attack on a
British embassy vehicle in Yemen on Oct. 6 that left a number of
people injured, including a U.K. citizen, the department said.
U.S. President  Barack Obama  said this week, while marking the
10th anniversary of an Al-Qaida attack on the USS Cole off
Yemen’s coast, that the group continues to use the country as a
platform to pursue a “ murderous agenda .”  “Terrorist attacks are likely and could occur at any time
anywhere in Yemen with little or no warning,” the department
said. “We advise you not to travel to Yemen at this time,” and
“if you are in Yemen you should consider leaving,” it said.  Reported online statements by a Yemen-based terrorist group
this year show a “continuing intent to attack Westerners and
western targets,” the department said, adding that the Ramadan
season may be used as an opportunity to conduct attacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
