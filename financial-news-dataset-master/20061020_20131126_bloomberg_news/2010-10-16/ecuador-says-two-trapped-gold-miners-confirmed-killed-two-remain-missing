Rescue workers recovered today the
bodies of two of the four miners trapped in a gold mine in
southern Ecuador, the South American country said.  Walter Vera and Paul Aguirre found dead underneath rubble
from the cave-in yesterday, according to a statement on the
president’s website. Two miners are still missing, the statement
said. Agence France-Presse, citing an unidentified official,
reported three miners were dead. The report couldn’t be
immediately verified.  The government had begun today clearing 200 metric tons of
rock from the entrance to the area, Maria del Pilar Cornejo,
head of the National Risk Management Secretary, said this
morning in comments on state television ECTV. Rescue workers
also began drilling a hole to send down communication cables in
an attempt to establish contact with the miners, Cornejo said.  The government is trying to rescue the remaining men,
trapped 150 meters (492 feet) below ground, after a water leak
at a gold, silver, and copper mine owned by Machala, Ecuador-
based  Minesadco SA , eroded support structures in the area where
the miners were working.  The accident comes two days after the rescue of 33 Chilean
miners, trapped below ground for 70 days in what became the
world’s longest mine rescue.  “We’re going to do everything possible to save them,”
President  Rafael Correa  said today from the presidential palace
in Quito during his weekly address to the nation. “God willing,
we will find them alive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
