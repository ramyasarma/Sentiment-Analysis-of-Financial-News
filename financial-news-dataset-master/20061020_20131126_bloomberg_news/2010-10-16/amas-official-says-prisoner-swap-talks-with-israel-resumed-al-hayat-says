 Mediated negotiations between Hamas
and Israel on a prisoner exchange involving a captive Israeli
soldier in the Gaza Strip and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners
have resumed, the Saudi-owned Al-Hayat newspaper reported,
citing a Damascus-based Hamas official.  Mussa Abu Marzuk told Al-Hayat a German mediator involved
in the negotiations held talks with Hamas leaders two weeks ago
and then spoke with Israeli officials trying to win the release
of Gilad Shalit, a soldier held captive in Gaza for over four
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
