Typhoon Megi is strengthening as it
heads across the Pacific Ocean toward the Philippines where it’s
expected to make landfall within three days, said the Philippine
Atmospheric, Geophysical & Astronomical Services Administration.  Megi, known in the Philippines as Juan, was about 1,040
kilometers (646 miles) east of Northern Luzon at 7 a.m. local
time, the administration said on its  website . The storm is
forecast to move northwest at 20 kilometers an hour, reaching
Cagayan late on Oct. 18. Its maximum winds are blowing at 170
kph.  Winds may strengthen to 250 kph as the storm nears Luzon,
the country’s most populous island, the U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon
Warning Center said yesterday. That would make it a Category 5
storm, the strongest, on the  Saffir-Simpson  Hurricane Wind scale
and capable of “catastrophic damage,” according to the U.S.
National Hurricane Center.  The administration today advised fishing boats and small
vessels not to venture out to sea and alerted larger ships
against the risk of waves of as high as 4.5 meters. Megi is
forecast to leave the Philippines on Oct. 19, heading northwest
toward Hainan, China.  Megi is the name of a catfish in South Korea and is related
to the feeling of getting wet, according to the Hong Kong
Observatory, which lists names assigned to storms in the
northwest Pacific. Megi is the 15th storm of the season.  Typhoon Conson left 102 people dead in the Philippines in
July and destroyed or damaged more than 70,000 homes, the
National Disaster Coordinating Council  said  in August.  To contact the reporter for this story:
