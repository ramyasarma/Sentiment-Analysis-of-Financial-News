The New York Yankees rallied from a
five-run deficit, scoring five times in the eighth inning to
defeat the Texas Rangers 6-5 in the opening game of their
American League Championship Series.  Alex Rodriguez had a two-run single, Derek Jeter hit a run-
scoring double and Robinson Cano and Marcus Thames added RBI
singles in New York’s eighth-inning outburst.  Josh Hamilton’s three-run home run in the first inning and
Michael Young’s two-run double in the fourth had staked the
Rangers to a 5-0 lead and left them six outs from getting the
first home postseason win in club history.  Game 2 in the best-of-seven series is tomorrow afternoon at
Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas, with Phil Hughes pitching
for the Yankees and Colby Lewis scheduled to start for Texas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
