Czech Premier Petr Necas’s Civic
Democrats party lost its grip on large cities in municipal
elections, partial returns showed from a ballot that is seen as
a test for the popularity of the three-party ruling coalition.  In the capital Prague, the TOP09 party led by Foreign
Minister Karel Schwarzenberg has about 30 percent of the vote,
besting Necas’s Civic Democrats, which were second with 23
percent, making former central bank Governor Zdenek Tuma a
favorite to become the next mayor of the city of about 1.3
million.  If confirmed, it would be the first time the Civic
Democrats failed to win a majority in Europe’s fifth-richest
city per capita. Full results are expected to be released early
tomorrow, election officials said on state-run television.  Less than half of the coountry participated in the vote,
according to the country’s statistics office.  In elections to the upper house, or Senate, the Czech
Social Democrats will send 22 candidates into a run-off vote in
one week’s time, while the Civic Democrats were second with 18
seats.  Public Affairs, led by Interior Minister Radek John, scored
only 5.8 percent in Prague and failed to advance in the Senate
or make significant gains in other cities.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
