Barcelona soccer club members voted
to sue former president  Joan Laporta  and his fellow directors
after auditors found the club posted a 79.6 million euro ($111.3
million) annual loss instead of a profit.  Senior members at the team’s annual general meeting today
voted by 468 to 439 to start legal action, according to
Barcelona’s  website . There were 113 abstentions. Laporta, who
published accounts showing a 9 million-euro profit for the 12
months through June, denies any wrongdoing. He said on Oct. 14
the accounts his managers presented were “impeccable.”  Laporta, 48, oversaw the most successful stint in the
club’s history as Barcelona won Europe’s Champions League in
2006 and 2009.  Sandro Rosell , a 46-year-old former Nike Inc.
marketing executive who replaced Laporta in July, ordered an
audit by accountants KPMG LLP and posted details of the spending
on the club website. Rosell had quit Laporta’s board in 2005.  The KPMG audit found Laporta’s board should have accounted
for a loss of 37.8 million euros following a lawsuit by pay-TV
company Sogecable SA, a 26.5 million-euro real estate loss, and
a 15.3 million-euro decline in income from Mediaproduccion SL, a
Spanish television company. The auditors also detailed spending
on five-star hotels, private jets and night clubs.  Barcelona is owned by more than 170,000 members who pay
annual fees of 157 euros, or about 15 percent of the club’s
revenue. The president and club directors are elected by the
members every four years and don’t receive a salary.  A message left today at Laporta’s law firm outside office
hours wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
