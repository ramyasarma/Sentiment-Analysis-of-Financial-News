The dollar fell for a fifth week
against the euro, matching a losing streak that ended in
December 2008, as traders speculated the Federal Reserve will
further ease monetary policy, debasing the greenback.  The U.S. currency dropped this week to a 15-year low
against the yen and fell to parity with the Australian and
Canadian dollars before next week’s Fed report on regional
economies. Asian currencies rallied against the dollar as
Singapore sought faster currency appreciation, pulling back from
efforts to stem gains.  “There’s a bit of push and pull in dollar weakness: the
push has been revolving around quantitative easing, and the pull
has been the attractiveness of emerging-market currencies,”
said  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York.  The dollar fell 0.3 percent to $1.3977 per euro, from
$1.3939 on Oct. 8 It slid to $1.4159 yesterday, the weakest
level since Jan. 26. The greenback slid 0.6 percent to 81.45
yen, from 81.93 last week. It touched 80.88 yesterday, the
weakest level since April 1995, when it reached the post-World
War II low of 79.75 yen. The euro dropped 0.3 percent to 113.88
yen, from 114.19.  The U.S. currency’s five weeks of decline against the euro
tied a stretch of losses during a period that ended Dec. 26,
2008. The central bank cut its fed funds target that month to a
range of zero to 0.25 percent.  Aussie at Parity  Australia’s dollar touched $1.0004 yesterday, trading
stronger than the greenback for the first time since currency
controls ended in 1983. The Aussie appreciated 0.6 percent to
99.07 U.S. cents this week.  Canada’s dollar rose to parity on Oct. 14 for the first
time since April, touching 99.81 cents versus its U.S.
counterpart on speculation the nation’s economy will benefit
from more purchases of government debt by the Fed, a policy
known as quantitative easing. The loonie ended the week up 0.1
percent to C$1.0104 per U.S. dollar.  The  Dollar Index , used by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to
track the greenback against currencies including the euro, yen
and pound, fell 0.4 percent to 77.041 after touching 76.144
yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 11.  The gauge of the greenback has dropped 4.2 percent since
Sept. 21, when the Fed said in a statement following its policy
meeting that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation
if needed” to support the recovery.  Bernanke’s View  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday in remarks at a
Boston Fed conference that the central bank may expand asset
purchases or change the language in its statement, while saying
“nonconventional policies” have costs and limitations. “There
would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case for further
action,” Bernanke said.  The central bank will release on Oct. 20 its Beige Book
survey of regional Fed banks. Last month, the report found the
economic rebound showed signs of slowing. Minutes of the Fed’s
September meeting released on Oct. 12 indicated that policy
makers were poised to take more easing steps “before long.”  The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in September
after 0.3 percent gains in the prior two months, the Labor
Department reported yesterday. The median forecast of 79
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.2 percent
increase.  “CPI showed benign inflation pressures across the board,
which are not likely to hinder the Fed from embarking on
additional asset purchases,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market
analyst in Washington at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a
currency brokerage.  Singapore’s Dollar  Singapore’s dollar rallied for a ninth week, advancing 0.8
percent to 1.2958 per dollar after the city state said it would
allow its currency to appreciate in a bid to control inflation.  Malaysia’s ringgit gained 1 percent to 3.0820 against the
dollar after touching 3.0800 on Oct. 14, the strongest level in
13 years. South Korea’s won climbed 0.8 percent to 1,111.50
versus the dollar after reaching 1,110.05 this week, the
strongest level since May 3.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index  climbed 0.4
percent to 115.93, advancing for a seventh straight week. The
index reached 115.97 yesterday, the highest since April 2008.  The U.S. Treasury Department said it will delay a report on
international currencies, including China’s yuan, while citing
progress in the acceleration of the pace of the yuan’s rise.  Stronger Yuan  The yuan advanced 0.5 percent this week and touched 6.6406,
the strongest level since the central bank unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The report will be delayed until after the meetings of the
Group of 20 nations in the coming weeks, according to a
statement from the Treasury.  The greenback has tumbled 5 percent against the yen since
Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged intervening in the market by
selling the currency to prevent its strength from undermining
the nation’s export-dependent economy.  “Everybody is very cautious about a possible Bank of Japan
intervention in the near term,” said  Hidetoshi Yanagihara , a
senior currency trader at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New
York. “The market has been weak-dollar for a long time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
