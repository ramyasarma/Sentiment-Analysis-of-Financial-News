Petroplus Holdings AG said it is
shutting down some operations at its Reichstett, France, and
Cressier, Switzerland, refineries because of labor disputes.  Restart of the Reichstett plant “is dependent on the
outcome of the strikes,” Petroplus said in a statement today.
It will meet with the works council on Oct. 21, it said.  Crude oil processing at Cressier is being reduced due to a
labor strike at the port in Fos Sur Mer, France, which is
disrupting the supply of crude to the refinery, according to the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
