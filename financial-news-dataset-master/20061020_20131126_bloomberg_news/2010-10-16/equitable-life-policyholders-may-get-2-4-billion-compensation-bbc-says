Equitable Life Assurance Society
policyholders will be offered 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion)
in compensation by the government next week, three times more
than recommended by an inquiry into the pension provider’s near-
collapse, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  John Chadwick, the former judge who led an inquiry into
regulators’ failure to properly oversee what was once one of the
U.K.’s largest private pension providers, had suggested
policyholders receive about 500 million pounds, the BBC said,
without saying where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
