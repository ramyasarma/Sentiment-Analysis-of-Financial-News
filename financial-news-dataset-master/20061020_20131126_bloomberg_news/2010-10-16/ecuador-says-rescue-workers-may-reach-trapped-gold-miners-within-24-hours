Rescue workers may reach four miners
trapped in a gold mine in southern Ecuador within 24 hours, the
South American country said today.  The government has begun clearing 200 metric tons of rock
from the entrance to the area where the men have been trapped
since yesterday, Maria del Pilar Cornejo, head of the National
Risk Management Secretary, said this morning in comments
broadcast on state television ECTV.  Rescue workers also will begin drilling a hole to send down
communication cables in an attempt to establish contact with the
miners, Cornejo said.  The government is trying to rescue the men, trapped 150
meters (492 feet) below ground, after a water leak at a gold,
silver, and copper mine owned by Machala, Ecuador-based
 Minesadco SA , eroded support structures in the area where the
miners were working. The accident comes two days after the
rescue of 33 Chilean miners, trapped below ground for 70 days in
what became the world’s longest mine rescue.  “We’re going to do everything possible to save them,”
President  Rafael Correa  said today from the presidential palace
in Quito during his weekly address to the nation. “God willing,
we will find them alive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
