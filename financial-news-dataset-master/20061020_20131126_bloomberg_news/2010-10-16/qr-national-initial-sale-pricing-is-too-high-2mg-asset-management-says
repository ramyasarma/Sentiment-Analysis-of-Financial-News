The Queensland government’s pricing
is too high for the sale of shares in its coal-train operator QR
National Ltd., Mike Mangan, a fund manager at 2MG Asset
Management, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. in an
interview broadcast today. The high end of the government’s
proposed pricing is “dreamland” and the low end is more
expensive than almost any other comparable stock, Mangan
told the ABC’s Inside Business program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
