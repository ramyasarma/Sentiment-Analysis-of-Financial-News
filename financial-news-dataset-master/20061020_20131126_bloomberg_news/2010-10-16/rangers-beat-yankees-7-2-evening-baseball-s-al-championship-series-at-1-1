David Murphy had a solo home run and
a run-scoring double as the Texas Rangers defeated the Yankees
7-2, sending the American League Championship Series to New York
tied 1-1.  The Rangers, who blew a five-run lead last night in Game 1,
took an early five-run lead again today and went on to the first
postseason home victory in club history.  Colby Lewis, who was dumped by three Major League Baseball
teams in 2007 and then spent 2008-2009 in Japan, got the win for
Texas by allowing two runs in 5 2/3 innings.  Game 3 in the best-of-seven series is set for Oct. 18, with
the Rangers’ Cliff Lee facing the Yankees’ Andy Pettitte in a
battle of left-handed starters.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
