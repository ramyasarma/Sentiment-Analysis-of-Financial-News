Treasury 30-year bonds tumbled,
pushing yields to the biggest weekly increase since August 2009,
on speculation that Federal Reserve efforts to spur the economy
will reignite inflation.  The  30-year  yield rose above 4 percent yesterday for the
first time in two months after data showed retail sales rose
more than forecast and New York area manufacturing climbed. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said additional stimulus may be
warranted, in part because inflation is too low. The Fed will
release its regional economic survey next week. The U.S. sold
$66 billion of notes and bonds to lower-than-average demand.  “Out to 30 years, they’re looking and saying, ‘With the
fire-power the Fed can bring to bear, is it really something I
feel comfortable with?’” said  Mitchell Stapley , the Grand
Rapids, Michigan-based chief fixed-income officer for Fifth
Third Asset Management, which oversees $22 billion. “People are
saying no.”  The  yield  on the so-called long bond climbed 23 basis
points, or 0.23 percentage point, to 3.98 percent, from 3.75
percent on Oct. 8, according to BGCantor Market Data. It touched
4.01 percent yesterday, the most since Aug. 10. The increase was
the biggest since a 31-basis point jump for the five days ended
Aug. 7, 2009. The 3.875 percent security due in August 2040
dropped 4 3/32, or $40.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 5/32.  The  10-year note  yield rose 17 basis points, the most since
December, to 2.56 percent, from 2.39 percent last week. It was
the yield’s first weekly gain since Sept. 10. The five-year note
yield also increased for the first week in more than a month,
adding eight basis points to 1.19 percent.  ‘Nonconventional Policies’  Bernanke said yesterday the  central bank  could expand  asset
purchases , a strategy known as quantitative easing, or change
the language in its statement to try to spur the economy. He
added that “nonconventional policies have costs and limitations
that must be taken into account in judging whether and how
aggressively they should be used.”  “There would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a
case for further action,” the Fed chairman said in a speech to
a Boston Fed conference.  A report yesterday showed the cost of living in the U.S.
rose less than forecast in September. The consumer-price index
was up 0.1 percent after 0.3 percent gains in the prior two
months, figures from the Labor Department showed in Washington.  Inflation Outlook  The  spread  between yields on 30-year bonds and comparable
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, an indication of
inflation expectations over the life of the securities, touched
2.61 percentage points yesterday, the widest since May 14. The
five-year average is 2.4 percentage points. The gap between 10-
year notes and comparable TIPS reached 2.18 percentage points on
Oct. 14, also the most in five months.  The  extra yield  investors demand for 30-year bonds compared
with 10-year debt touched a record high 1.46 percentage points
yesterday. The five-year average is 0.52 percentage point,
according to Bloomberg data.  “Bernanke makes no mentions of a ‘shock and awe’ approach,
and indeed notes on multiple occasions that any new asset-
purchase initiative should proceed with ‘caution,’”  Michael Cloherty , head of U.S. rates strategy for fixed-income and
currencies at Royal Bank of Canada in New York, wrote in a note
to clients. “The Fed seems inclined to take a ‘baby steps’
approach.” RBC is one of the 18 primary dealers that trade with
the central bank.  The Fed previously acquired about $1.7 trillion of Treasury
and mortgage-related debt to sustain the recovery, concluding
the program in March.  Beige Book  Policy makers, who have kept the benchmark  interest rate  at
a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008, are
scheduled to meet next Nov. 2-3. The Fed releases its Beige Book
survey of regional economic conditions on Oct. 20. Last month,
it found the economic rebound showed signs of slowing.  Retail sales in the U.S. rose 0.6 percent last month, just
below the 0.7 percent revised gain in August, Commerce
Department data showed yesterday in Washington. Economists had
forecast a rise of 0.4 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey.  The Fed Bank of New York’s Empire State manufacturing index
surged to 15.73 this month, from a revised 4.14 last month.
Readings greater than zero signal expansion in the area covering
New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut.  “The economic news was a bit better than what the market
was looking for,” said  Gary Pollack , who helps oversee $12
billion as head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s
Private Wealth Management unit in New York. “Nevertheless, we
expect the Fed to announce something at the next meeting because
inflation remains very low.”  Auction Demand Weakens  The government’s auction of $13 billion of 30-year
Treasuries on Oct. 14 drew $2.49 in  bids per dollar  of debt sold,
the lowest level since February. The average for the past 10
auctions of the security was $2.70.  The $21 billion  10-year note sale  the previous day drew
$2.99 in bids per dollar, the lowest since May. Demand for the
$32 billion offering of three-year notes on Oct. 12, $2.95 per
dollar offered, compared with an average of $3.12 for the past
10 auctions.  “We are getting QE -- the question is not ‘if,’ it’s ‘how
much?” said  David Ader , head of government bond strategy at
Stamford, Connecticut-based CRT Capital Group LLC. “We got to a
level where people clearly think it’s enough for now, and we’ve
got auction paper to distribute, particularly at the long end.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
