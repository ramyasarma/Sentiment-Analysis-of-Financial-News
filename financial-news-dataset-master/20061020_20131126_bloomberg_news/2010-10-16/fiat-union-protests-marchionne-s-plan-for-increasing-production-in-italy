Fiat SpA ’s  largest union  protested
today in Rome against Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne ’s proposal to curb strikes and increase shifts at the
company’s Pomigliano d’Arco car factory in southern Italy.  Italy’s biggest manufacturer is using the Pomigliano plan
as a test case to win labor concessions that may become a
watershed for Italian companies.  “Competition is not pursued by cutting salaries and
rights,” and “it’s not true that companies don’t have social
responsibility,” said Maurizio Landini, head of the FIOM Union.
He called for a general strike in his speech.  Marchionne wants to improve productivity at Fiat’s domestic
plants, which lags that at the company’s foreign factories, in
exchange for shifting production of its Panda model from Poland
to Pomigliano. Turin-based Fiat plans to invest 20 billion euros
($28 billion) through 2014 in Italy to improve plants and
vehicle development if unions agree to reduce strikes and add
shifts.  While a majority of workers at the Pomigliano plant near
Naples approved the deal in June, more than a third of them
voted against it, saying Marchionne’s proposal violated their
constitutional right to strike.  Marchionne has said he will proceed with the investment
plan, called “Fabbrica Italia,” or “Italian factory,” only
if unions agree to boost productivity in a new labor contract.  “We submitted counterproposals with regard to Pomigliano
and we are still waiting for an answer,” Landini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
