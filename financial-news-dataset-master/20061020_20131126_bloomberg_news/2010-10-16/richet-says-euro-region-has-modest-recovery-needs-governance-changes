European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said that a “modest” recovery persists in
the euro region and that he remains “prudent” on the strength
of the economic rebound.  The financial crisis shows the need for global financial
regulation and exposed the risk of having different rules of the
game that can lead to regulatory arbitrage, he said in the text
of a speech delivered today in Marrakech.  Protetionist pressures are intensifying, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
