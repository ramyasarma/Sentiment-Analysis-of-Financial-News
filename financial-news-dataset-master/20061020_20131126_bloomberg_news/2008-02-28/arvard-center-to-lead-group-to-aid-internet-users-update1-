             Harvard is teaming up with  News
Corp. (NWSA) ,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Google (GOOG)  Inc. to develop tools to
protect  Internet users  from sex offenders and scams.  
 Harvard Law School's Berkman Center for Internet and
Society will lead a  task force  to ensure the identity and ages
of Internet users. The group was formed after a January
agreement between News Corp.'s MySpace.com and attorneys general
from 49 states and the District of Columbia, according to
statement today by the school in Cambridge,  Massachusetts .  
 The agreement also called on MySpace.com, an online social-networking portal, to delete registered sex offenders and keep
private the profiles of 14- and 15-year-old users.  
 ``The safety concerns posed by the Internet are part and
parcel of the safety concerns that arise in human interactions
in the physical world,'' said John Palfrey, the executive
director of the Berkman Center, a research program focused on
cyberspace. ``These concerns are not unique to any one service
or technology platform.''  
 Time Warner (TWX)  Inc.'s AOL unit,  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , and more than
15 other companies and nonprofit organizations are also members
of the group, called the Internet Safety Technical Task Force.
