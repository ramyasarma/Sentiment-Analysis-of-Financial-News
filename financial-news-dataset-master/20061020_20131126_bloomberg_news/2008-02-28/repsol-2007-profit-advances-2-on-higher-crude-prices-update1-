             Repsol YPF SA , Spain's  largest  oil
company, said profit rose 2 percent in 2007 as higher crude-oil
prices countered a slump in production.  
 Net income  grew to 3.19 billion euros ($4.82 billion) from
3.12 million euros a year earlier, Madrid-based Repsol said today
in a filing. Oil and natural-gas production fell 7.9 percent.  
 Bolstering output and refining capacity is the thrust of the
company's 28 billion-euro  investment plan  through 2009. Repsol
sold a stake in its Argentine unit YPF, raising funds to explore
in the U.S. and North Africa. Today Chairman  Antonio Brufau  will
present a revised growth plan through 2012.  
 Oil and gas output dropped to 1.04 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day from 1.13 million in 2006, after the Bolivian
government took control of a majority stake in the nation's
reserves, and production in Venezuela and Argentina declined.  
 Earlier this month, Repsol closed the sale of 15 percent of
Argentine unit YPF SA to local investor Enrique Eskenazi for $2.2
billion. Before the end of the first half, a further 20 percent
stake is slated to be sold on the stock exchange. The Spanish
explorer and refiner bought YPF from Argentina's government in
1999.  
 Repsol sold 5 percent of Cia Logistica de Hidrocarburos SA
to Deutsche Bank AG in the fourth quarter for 176.5 million
euros. The company also divested its gasoline stations in  Chile 
for $210 million.  
 In December, Repsol found gas in  Bolivia  and joined a
project to search for the fuel in  Angola . This year, the company
has discovered oil in the Peruvian jungle and won licenses to
explore off  Alaska ,  Mexico  and Spain.  
 Brufau plans to fit Repsol's Spanish refineries with
equipment to process lower grades of crude to earn more from
making fuels.
