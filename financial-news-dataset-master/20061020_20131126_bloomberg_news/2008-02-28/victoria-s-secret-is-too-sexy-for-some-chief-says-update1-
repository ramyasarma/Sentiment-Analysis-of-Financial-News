             Victoria's Secret, the  Limited
Brands Inc. (LTD)  unit, may be selling lingerie that's ``too sexy''
for some of its customers, the company's chief executive officer
said today.  
 ``I really feel so strongly about us getting back to our
heritage and really thinking in terms of ultra-feminine and not
just the word sexy,'' CEO Sharen Turney said on a conference
call with investors today. That would help its lingerie become
``much more relevant to our customer,'' she said.  
 Limited Brands, owner of Victoria's Secret and the Bath &
Body Works chain, said February same-store sales would fall by a
percentage in the ``low double-digit range'' from February 2007.
Victoria's Secret, Columbus, Ohio-based Limited's biggest-selling brand, will introduce new bras and pajamas to win sales
from shoppers struggling with falling home values and rising
fuel costs.  
 ``Victoria's Secret's singular focus on being sexy has
resulted in a tawdry image and a somewhat bordello feeling in
store,'' Kimberly Greenberger, the Citigroup Capital Markets
Inc. analyst whose question prompted Turney's comments, said in
an e-mail.  
 ``We believe Limited's management has taken notice and
realizes they need to recalibrate the Victoria's Secret brand to
a higher taste level,'' she said, describing the decision as ``a
terrific strategic move.''  
 Greenberger recommends clients hold their  Limited Brands 
shares.  
 `Less Seductive'  
 On the conference call, Turney described Victoria's
Secret's Super Bowl advertisement, which featured model Adriana Lima spinning a football in her hands as she sat on a white
armchair, as ``a little less seductive'' and ``kind of the
direction that we're moving in.''  
 Limited Brands may be trying to re-energize a brand in need
of ``refreshing,''said  Richard Jaffe , an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. Inc.  
 ``Are they turning off customers by being too sexy?'' Jaffe
said. ``No, I don't think that's the issue. Could it have grown
jaded or stale? Perhaps.''  
 Limited Brands fell $1.97, or 11 percent, to $15.85 at 4:26
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite  trading , the biggest
drop in almost six and a half years, after forecasting first-quarter profit that trailed some analysts'  estimates .
