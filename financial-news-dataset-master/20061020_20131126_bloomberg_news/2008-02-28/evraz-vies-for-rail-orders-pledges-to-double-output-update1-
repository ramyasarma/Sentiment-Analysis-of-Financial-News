             Evraz Group SA plans to spend 500
million euros ($755 million) doubling output at its rail mills as
it vies with other Russian steelmakers to supply tracks to OAO
Russian Railways, the world's largest railroad operator.  
 The company will make almost 2 million tons a year of rail
in  Russia  after completing the upgrade of its plants in 2011,
Chief Executive  Alexander Frolov  said at a conference in Moscow.  
 ``Russian Railways remains our biggest partner and our
biggest buyer,'' Frolov said. Russian Railways buys about 700,000
tons of rails a year from Evraz, he said.  
 Russian steelmakers are competing for more than $400 billion
of contracts Russian Railways pledged to metal, construction and
timber companies through 2030 as it builds new tracks and buys
trains. The world's largest rail network plans to add 20,000
kilometers (12,400 miles) by 2030.  
 Rival Moscow-based steelmaker OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  won a 20-year order
for track from Russian Railways this week, ending Evraz's
domestic monopoly.  
 OAO Severstal, Russia's largest steelmaker, is upgrading its
Lucchini Piombino plant in  Italy  and obtaining Russian
certification for its rails to be able to sell them to Russian
Railways. Severstal could boost capacity at the Italian plant to
500,000 tons within two years.  
 Evraz produces 1.6 million tons of rails a year, about a
fifth of the world's output, Frolov said. Evraz sells as much as
500,000 tons in the U.S. market.  
 Rail products, including tracks and wheels, make as much as
15 percent of Evraz's product portfolio, Frolov said.
