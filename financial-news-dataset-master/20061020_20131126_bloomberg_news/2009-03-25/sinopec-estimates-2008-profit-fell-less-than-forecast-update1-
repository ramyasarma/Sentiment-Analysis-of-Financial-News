             China Petroleum and Chemical Corp. ,
 Asia ’s largest refiner, said it estimates 2008 net income fell
by about 50 percent, a smaller decline than what it had
previously forecast.  
 The Beijing-based refiner, also known as Sinopec, estimated
in January that profit fell by more than 50 percent last year.
The company is amending the results after having completed more
auditing of its earnings, Sinopec said today in a statement to
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  
 Sinopec’s shares have fallen  1.1 percent  in Hong Kong this
year, compared with a 5.3 percent decline for the city’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index. Its Shanghai-listed shares have
gained  26 percent  this year, equaling the increase for the
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index.
