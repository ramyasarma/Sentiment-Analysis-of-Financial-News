             The  Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development  agreed to lend  Syria  $257.4 million to finance the
construction of a natural-gas pipeline, a power plant and a road,
the  Syrian Arab News Agency  reported.  
 Abdullatif Hamad, director general of the Kuwait-based fund,
and Syrian Finance Minister Ahmed al-Hussein signed the loan
agreement, state-run Sana said, reporting from the ceremony in
Damascus today. It didn’t specify the funding that each of the
three projects would get.  
 The projects are a pipeline to carry Egyptian gas through
Syrian territory, the Deir Ali gas-fired power plant, near
Damascus, and a road in the northeast that leads to the Iraqi
border, the agency said. The Arab fund is an organization of the
22-state, Cairo-based  Arab League .
