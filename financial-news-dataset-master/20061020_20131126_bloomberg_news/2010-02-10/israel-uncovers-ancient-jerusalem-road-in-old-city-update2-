             An ancient Jerusalem thoroughfare
walked by Christian pilgrims 1,500 years ago was uncovered in
the Old City, confirming the authenticity of a mosaic map in a
church in Jordan, Israel Antiquities Authority said today.  
 The remains of what was once one of the city’s large
bustling streets went undiscovered, said archaeologists. Other
important buildings on the map have been found over the years,
or survived to this day, including the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre, where tradition holds that Jesus was crucified.  
 “At a depth of 4.5 meters below today’s street level,
much to our excitement we discovered the large flagstones that
paved the street,” Ofer Sion, excavation director for the
authority, said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The excavation, part of a renovation of the area, started
three weeks ago and the street was discovered earlier this
week, said Authority spokeswoman Yoli Shwartz.  
 The find will be covered up again once the work is
finished, she said in a telephone interview. Also discovered in
the excavation were pottery vessels, coins and five small
square bronze weights that shopkeepers used for weighing
precious metals.  
 The Madaba Map is a mosaic in a church in Madaba, Jordan
that depicted Christian sites in the land of Israel.
