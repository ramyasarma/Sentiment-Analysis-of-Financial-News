             On Tuesday, I attended the  Front End of Innovation conference  in Amsterdam. It was good to see innovation leaders from a wide range of companies in attendance — to me it was a small but important sign of an increasingly stable global economy.  

 I provided a few thoughts in the morning, and then heard a fascinating presentation from Patrick O'Riordan — global director of innovation at Anheuser-Busch InBev. Here are some of his lessons for innovators: 

 Explain strategic objectives in simple terms.  AB InBev is the world's largest beer company. Its strategic objectives are to increase SOB (share of beer) and SOT (share of throat). It can achieve these objectives by getting consumers to switch to its products, consume its products in new locations, or attract new consumers. I'm guessing that the simple and immediately memorable language brings great clarity to AB InBev's innovation efforts. Importantly, it clarifies things that InBev won't do, which is an overlooked innovation enabler. 

 Have defined types of innovation strategies.  Patrick described two basic innovation strategies. "Renovations" involve strengthening existing product lines through new marketing campaigns or mild formulation changes. "Innovations" involve completely new products. Patrick noted that you needed both. As he said, "You wouldn't add an extension to your house if your foundation was crumbling."  

 Again, I bet you most people in AB InBev could recite these strategic choices easily. My experience suggests that clarity about strategic intent helps to spur productive dialogues around innovation. 

 Have a clear but robust innovation process.  AB InBev breaks innovation into a front-end process — which involves consumer discovery work, idea formulation, idea qualification, and so on — and a back-end process. The front-end process doesn't have fixed stage gates given its "fuzzy" and iterative nature. The back-end process is, appropriately, more rigid.  

 Draw insight from non-obvious places.  Patrick showed a slide describing the evolution of the Apple iPod. Clearly Apple isn't in the beverage industry. But the point was that Apple followed a clear platform strategy that mixed line extensions, new product forms, and supporting services, which allowed the company to realize the full potential of the iPod. Patrick described how AB InBev similarly seeks to develop beverage platforms. 

 I think the message of clarity that comprises AB InBev's innovation efforts is well worth remembering.
