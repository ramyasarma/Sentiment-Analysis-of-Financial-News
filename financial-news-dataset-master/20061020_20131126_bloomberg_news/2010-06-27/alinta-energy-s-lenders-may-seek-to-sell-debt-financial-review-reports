             Alinta Energy Ltd.’s prospective
buyers may struggle to value the company until its lenders agree
on a new debt package, the Australian Financial Review reported,
without saying where it got the information. Some of Alinta’s
lenders, who are owed A$2.7 billion, have sold debt for between
65 cents and 80 cents in the dollar, the newspaper said. Alinta
said in a June 23 regulatory filing it had received a number of
indicative, non-binding, confidential bids for both the entire
company and parts of the business.
