             Makhteshim-Agan Industries Ltd. , the
world’s biggest maker of generic crop chemicals, agreed to buy
Albaugh Inc., a privately held supplier of crop protection
chemicals, for about $1 billion in cash, notes and stock.  
 Tel Aviv-based Makhteshim will pay $340 million in cash,
$455 million in notes and issue 59 million shares, representing
a 12 percent stake in the company, for the Ankeny, Iowa-based
company, according to an e-mailed statement today. It also will
assume up to $280 million of Albaugh debt, the statement said.  
 “This is a transformational acquisition for Makhteshim,”
said Chief Executive Officer  Erez Vigodman  in the statement.
“It extends our industry leadership to North and South America,
giving us the opportunity to participate in fast-growing markets
and significantly improving the global balance and  diversity of
our revenue sources .”  
 Makhteshim, which  posted losses  in two of the last three
quarters, is looking to boost profit after insecticide prices
declined as farmers reduced production amid the global
recession, which reduced food demand. Speculation of another
merger in the industry increased after Sumitomo Chemical Co.
this year bought a 20 percent stake in Nufarm Ltd., Australia’s
largest farm chemicals supplier.  
 Makhteshim  shares  rose 1.2 percent to close at 13.81
shekels before the announcement. The stock has declined 28
percent over the  past year . Shares of Koor Industries Ltd.,
which owns 44 percent of Makhteshim, according to Bloomberg
data, fell 4.6 percent to 70.90 shekels.  
 “The acquisition is large and should strengthen the
company especially in the U.S. as Albaugh is one of the biggest
companies in North and South America with a similar sales level
as Makhteshim,” IBI analyst  Guil Bashan  said by telephone. “I
hope it will not place a burden on it financially.”  
 Bashan has a “neutral” recommendation on the shares,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The deal, which requires approval from European and U.S.
regulators, is likely to close in the fourth quarter and add to
adjusted earnings a year later, Makhteshim said.
