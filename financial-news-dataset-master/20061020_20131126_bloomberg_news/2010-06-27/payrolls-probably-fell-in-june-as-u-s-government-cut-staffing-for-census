             Employment fell in June for the
first time this year, reflecting a drop in federal census
workers as the decennial population count began to wind down,
economists said before a report this week.  
 Payrolls declined by 110,000 last month, according to the
median estimate of 51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
ahead of a Labor Department report July 2. Private employment,
which excludes government jobs, rose for a sixth consecutive
month, the survey showed.  
 The pace of hiring indicates it will take years for the
world’s largest economy to recover the more than 8 million jobs
lost during the recession that began in December 2007. The
turmoil in financial markets brought on by the European debt
crisis raises the risk that employment will slow, depriving
American households of the  income  needed to maintain spending.  
 “There is a somber tone that’s returned to the U.S.
economic outlook since the start of the European debt crisis,”
said  Ellen Zentner , a senior U.S. economist at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. “Financial-market volatility
makes businesses think twice about hiring. Spending will slow in
the third quarter.”  
 The Census Bureau says it let go about 243,000 of the
temporary workers who helped in conducting the population count
from mid-May to mid-June. Peak  census employment  reached about
586,000 in early May, indicating additional cuts to come that
will keep distorting the payroll figures for months.  
 Private Payrolls  
 For that reason, economists say private payrolls, which
exclude government jobs, will be a better gauge of the state of
the labor market for much of 2010. Employment at companies rose
by 113,000 after a 41,000 gain in May, according to the median
forecast of 29 economists surveyed.  
 The report will probably also show the  unemployment  rate
rose to 9.8 percent last month, according to the survey median,
from 9.7 percent. Joblessness, which reached a 26-year high of
10.1 percent in October, will take time to recede as the number
of previously discouraged jobseekers returning to the labor
force exceeds the number of available jobs.  
 Factory payrolls increased in June for the sixth straight
month, according to the survey. Service providers have also been
adding to headcounts this year.  
 Delta Air Lines Inc ., the world’s biggest carrier, will
hire 700 airport ticket and gate agents to help handle increased
summer traffic and operations disrupted by weather, Chris Kelly,
a Delta spokeswoman, said June 18 in an interview. The additions
are in addition to the 300 pilot and 300 reservation agent jobs
recently filled by the Atlanta-based airline.  
 Factory Rebound  
 Manufacturers in the U.S. are reaping the benefits of the
global recovery.  Deere & Co ., the world’s largest farm equipment
maker, last month reported second-quarter profit that topped
analysts’ estimates and raised earnings and sales forecasts for
a second time this year as demand improved.  
 Farm-machinery sales in the U.S. and Canada will gain 5
percent to 10 percent for the year and South American farm-
equipment sales are projected to jump about 25 percent because
of improvements in the Brazilian and Argentinean markets, Deere
said.  
 “Clearly the markets are improving and there’s a lot of
good news out of Brazil,” Susan Karlix, a Deere spokeswoman,
said May 19 on a conference call with analysts.  
 On July 1, the Institute for Supply Management’s
 manufacturing index  will show factories expanded in June for an
11th consecutive month, according to economists surveyed.
Manufacturing accounts for about 11 percent of the economy.  
 Manufacturers’ Shares  
 The manufacturing rebound has helped underpin shares. The
Standard & Poor’s  Supercomposite Industrial Machinery  Index of
52 companies, including Caterpillar Inc. and Deere, has
increased 7.8 percent so far this year compared with a 3.4
percent decline in the broader S&P 500.  
 Household spending climbed 0.1 percent in May after being
little changed the prior month, economists projected a report
from the Commerce Department tomorrow will show.  Incomes  likely
rose 0.5 percent, the biggest gain in a year, as an increase in
hours and average earnings more than made up for a smaller
increase in employment, the report will also show.  
 The Federal Reserve last week said slowing inflation and
the fallout from Europe’s debt crisis where among reasons it
will maintain interest rates low for “an extended period.”  
 The central bank said the labor market is “improving
gradually,” changing April’s assessment that it was “beginning
to improve.” Consumer spending still “remains constrained” by
joblessness and “tight credit,” it said.  
 Tax Credit  
 Housing is feeling the effects of the end of a homebuyer
tax credit, figures may show.  Construction spending , due from
the Commerce Department on July 1, fell 0.7 percent in May after
a gain of 2.7 percent, economists projected.  
 The following day, the National Association of Realtors
will publish its index of signed  purchase agreements , or pending
home resales, which will show a 14 percent decline in May after
three months of gains, according to the survey.  
 Another report from S&P/Case-Shiller on June 29 may show an
index of average home prices in  20 cities  rose 3.5 percent in
April from a year earlier.
