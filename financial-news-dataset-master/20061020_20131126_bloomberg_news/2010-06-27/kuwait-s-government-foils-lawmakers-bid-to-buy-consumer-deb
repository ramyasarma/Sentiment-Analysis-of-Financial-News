             Kuwait’s lawmakers failed to force
the government to endorse a popular bill that would have cost
the state about $23 billion to buy personal loans extended to
nationals and scrap accumulated interest.  
 Parliament approved the bill on Jan. 6, and the government
said the measure is unconstitutional and threatened the
stability of Kuwait’s banking system. It entails buying 6.7
billion dinars ($23 billion) of citizens’ consumer loans and
rescheduling repayment over as much as 15 years.  
 Twenty-six lawmakers voted today in favor of overriding a
decree that blocked the bill, and 33 members of the house,
including all cabinet ministers, voted against the move.  
 The government had proposed a compromise on the bill by
expanding a 500 million-dinar “defaulters fund” already set up
to help Kuwaitis unable to repay loans.
