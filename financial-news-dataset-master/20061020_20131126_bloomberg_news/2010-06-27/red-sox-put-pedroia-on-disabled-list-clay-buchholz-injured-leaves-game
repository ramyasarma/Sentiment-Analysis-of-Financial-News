             Boston Red Sox second baseman
 Dustin Pedroia  was placed on the 15-day disabled list after he
fouled a ball off his left foot in the third inning, breaking
the navicular bone.  
 Red Sox pitcher  Clay Buchholz , second in the American
League with 10 wins, left today’s game against the San
Francisco Giants in the second inning as he hyper-extended his
left knee while running on his first Major League Baseball hit,
reported MLB.com.  
 Boston acquired infielder/outfielder  Eric Patterson  from
the Oakland Athletics in exchange for left-handed minor league
pitcher Fabian Williamson. Patterson, 27, is hitting .204 with
five doubles, two triples, four homers and nine runs batted in
during 45 games this season.  
 Besides Pedroia and Buchholz, Red Sox players on the
disabled list include pitcher  Josh Beckett  with a back strain
and centerfielder  Jacoby Ellsbury  with a fractured left rib.  
 Pedroia, 26, was examined last night after leaving the
game. He had difficulty reaching first base when he drew a walk
to finish the at-bat. Initial tests didn’t reveal the fracture.  
 The Red Sox recalled shortstop Angel Sanchez from Triple-A
Pawtucket while Pedroia recovers. It isn’t known when he will
return.  
 Pedroia, the American League’s Most Valuable Player in
2008, is hitting .292 with 41 runs batted in, 52 runs scored
and 12 home runs in 72 games this season. He hit three homers
against the Colorado Rockies in Boston’s 13-11 win in 10
innings on June 24.
