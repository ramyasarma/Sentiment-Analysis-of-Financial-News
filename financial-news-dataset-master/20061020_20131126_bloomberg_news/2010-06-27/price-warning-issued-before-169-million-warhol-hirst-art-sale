             Contemporary art has become a more
risky investment, according to a survey published before the
next big test of the auction market starting today.  
 Research company ArtTactic’s findings raise concern at the
sustainability of the recovery in prices after recent sale
flops. Works by  Andy Warhol  and  Damien Hirst  will be among 112.4
million pounds ($169 million) of art on offer from this evening
in London.  
 The survey’s Risk Barometer jumped 22 percent on concerns
over the short-term economic outlook. Fifty-five percent of 138
contemporary-art collectors and professionals see little
improvement over the next six months,  ArtTactic  said, though
overall confidence was 4.2 percent higher than in December 2009.  
 “The recovery of the art market is on,”  Anders Petterson ,
founder and managing director of ArtTactic, said in an
interview. “Economic realities look as though they’re going to
slow that recovery. This is going to be a tough five years going
forward and wealthy collectors aren’t oblivious to what’s
happening.”  
 Trophy works at  Sotheby’s  and  Christie’s International’s 
evening sales of Impressionist and modern art last week
struggled to realize expectations that were raised by recent
auction records for  Alberto Giacometti ,  Pablo Picasso  and  Amedeo Modigliani .  
 An  Edouard Manet  self portrait fell to a single bid of 22.4
million pounds at Sotheby’s on June 22. At Christie’s the
following evening, a ‘Blue Period’ Picasso sold within estimate
for 34.8 million pounds and a  Claude Monet  water lily painting,
valued as much as 40 million pounds, failed. There was less
buying from clients in the emerging economies, both auction
houses said after their sales.  
 Fewer Asian Bids  
 “There was some activity from Asia, but it was mostly
bottom-fishing,” the Paris-based dealer Christian Ogier, who
specializes in 20th century Chinese art. “It was very
surprising. There was a lot of Asian bidding in New York in
May,” said Ogier, who was monitoring the telephone bids taken
by Sotheby’s and Christie’s Hong Kong-based specialists at the
London sales.  
 This week the focus shifts to contemporary art, beginning
tonight at Sotheby’s, where 53 lots are expected to raise at
least 38.3 million pounds.  
 The improved volume of sales earlier this month at the
annual Art Basel fair in Switzerland was reminiscent of pre-
crisis levels, said dealers, though individual prices often
remained lower than in 2007 and 2008.  
 Hirst Cabinet  
 London gallery  White Cube  sold a new Hirst jewel cabinet,
priced at 2.35 million pounds, at Basel. In 2008, at the zenith
of the art boom, a similar cabinet fetched 5.2 million pounds at
the 111.5-million-pound Hirst auction at Sotheby’s.  
 “Business was brisk at Art Basel, though maybe not at the
same levels as two or three years ago,” said Petterson, who was
in the record crowd of 62,500 at the event.  
 Estimates at London’s June contemporary-art auctions
continue to reflect a market in recovery. Warhol was the most
exhibited artist at Art Basel and Sotheby’s is offering four
works by him in tonight’s evening sale.  
 His 1964 triptych of 20-inch-high silkscreens, “Three
Jackies,” showing the First Lady after President Kennedy’s
death, carries a low estimate of 1.5 million pounds. The trio of
canvases has been owned by the same collector since 1980 and
never been offered at auction before, said  Sotheby’s .  
 In October 2007, a single “Jackie” of the same date and
dimensions sold at auction for 1.75 million pounds.  
 ‘Silver Liz’  
 A Warhol painting of  Elizabeth Taylor , “Silver Liz,”
estimated at as much as 8 million pounds, is on offer at
Christie’s on June 30.  
 A 2005 mixed-media work by Matthew Day Jackson is among the
pieces by selected younger artists. The multicolored 12-foot-
wide “Phoenix (Peace Eagle),” showing the mythological bird
stretching its wings over an urban scrapheap, is among the 63
works  Christie’s  is offering on June 30. It carries an estimate
of 200,000 pounds to 300,000 pounds.  
 The U.S.-born Jackson shot to prominence in February when
his 2007 oval canvas “Bucky” sold for a record 601,250 pounds
($891,293) at a Christie’s auction in London.  
 Foil reliefs and stripe paintings by the German artist
 Anselm Reyle  were a familiar feature at auctions and art fairs
during the recent boom. Since then, prices for  Reyle , like many
other heavily traded contemporary artists, have fallen. Phillips
de Pury & Co. will be including the 2006 silver foil relief,
“Untitled,” in its June 29 evening auction with a low estimate
of 70,000 pounds.  
 An identically sized silver relief by Reyle, from 2005, was
sold by  Phillips  in 2008 for 157,250 pounds.
