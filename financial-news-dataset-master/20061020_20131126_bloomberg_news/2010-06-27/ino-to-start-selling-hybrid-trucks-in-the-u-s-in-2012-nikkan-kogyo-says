             Hino Motors Ltd. will start selling
hybrid trucks in the U.S. in 2012, the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper
reported, without saying where it obtained the information. The
trucks will be 1.5 times more efficient than the company’s
existing diesel models, the newspaper said. Hino is a subsidiary
of Toyota Motor Corp.
