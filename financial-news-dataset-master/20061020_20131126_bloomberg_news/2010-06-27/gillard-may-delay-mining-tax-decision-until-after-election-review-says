             The Australian government may seek
to delay a decision on the final shape of its mining tax until
after the upcoming federal election, the Australian Financial
Review reported, without saying where it got the information.
The government may offer bigger concessions to mining companies
in return for agreeing to the timetable, the newspaper said.
