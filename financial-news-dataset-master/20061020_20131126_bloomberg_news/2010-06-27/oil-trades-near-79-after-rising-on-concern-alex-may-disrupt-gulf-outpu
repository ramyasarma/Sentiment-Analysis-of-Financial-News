             Oil traded near $79 a barrel in New
York as the first tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season weakened and amid concerns that global economic growth
may slow, limiting fuel demand.  
 European equities and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
declined last week after disappointing U.S. housing data and a
surge in the cost of preventing a Greek default reignited
concern about the global economic recovery. Alex, the year’s
first named storm, weakened to a tropical depression, according
to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  
 “The U.S. recovery is looking less than impressive,” said
 Toby Hassall , a commodity analyst at CWA Global Markets Pty in
Sydney. “There is always that threat to production presented by
these Atlantic hurricanes. It’s expected to be a more active
than normal season this year.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery traded at $78.90 a barrel, up
4 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 9:53 a.m. Sydney time. The contract rose $2.35, or
3.1 percent, to $78.86 on June 25, the biggest gain since June 9.
Futures have dropped 0.6 percent since the start of the year.  
 Group of 20 leaders endorsed targets to cut deficits and
agreed to pursue higher capital requirements for banks once
their economic recoveries take root, according to a statement
released as they finished a meeting in Toronto yesterday.  
 Brent crude oil for August delivery traded at $78.27 a
barrel, up 15 cents on the ICE exchange in London at 9:42 a.m.
Sydney time. The contract gained $1.65, or 2.2 percent, to
$78.12 on June 25.
