             The average price of regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose to $2.7647 a gallon as
crude oil prices have risen and demand for the motor fuel has
slipped.  
 Gasoline gained 4.94 cents in the two weeks ended June 25,
according to a survey of 2,500 filling stations nationwide by
 Trilby Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst in Camarillo,
California.  
 “Crude oil is the main cause of that nickel rise,”
Lundberg said. “But absent some real supply threat, crude oil
is not on a steep climb from here, and neither is gasoline.”  
 Gasoline  demand , measured by what refiners and blenders
supply to wholesalers, fell 1 percent in the week ended June 18,
according to the Energy Department. Inventories were 4.2 percent
above a year earlier.  
 The front-month contract for crude oil gained 6.9 percent
in the two weeks ended June 25. Gasoline futures rose 5.8
percent.  
 U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump in the week ended June 18
slumped 2.7 percent from a year earlier,  MasterCard Inc.  said on
June 22 in its SpendingPulse report. Fuel consumption the first
three weeks of June was off 2.2 percent from the same period in
2009.  
 Regular gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, rose to
$2.755 a gallon from $2.753 yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  
 On Long Island, regular gasoline averaged $2.90 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.07 a
gallon.  
 Of the cities surveyed by Lundberg on June 25, the highest
price was San Francisco at $3.14 a gallon. The cheapest place to
buy gasoline was Charleston, South Carolina, where a gallon
averaged $2.49, she said.
