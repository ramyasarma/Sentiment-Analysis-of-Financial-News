             Kuwait stocks lost the most in two
weeks, leading a decline in Middle East markets, on concern
Europe’s debt crisis will slow the global economic recovery and
speculation Gulf earnings may disappoint. Israel shares fell.  
The Kuwait SE Price Index  slid 0.8 percent, the most since June
14, to 6,571.  Agility  led the drop, slumping to the lowest since
2003, after U.S. federal prosecutors said the logistics company
may still be overbilling the American government. Saudi Arabia’s
benchmark lost 0.6 percent. The TA-25 Index declined 0.7 percent
to 1,086.49, the lowest close since June 8, as Israel’s largest
communications company, Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp.,
retreated.  
 Global sentiment worsened last week as disappointing U.S.
housing data and a surge in the cost to protect from a Greek
default reignited concern about the economic recovery.  The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index  had its first weekly drop in more than a month
and the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 3.7 percent. Crude rose
the most in two weeks, while gold gained on speculation a
weakening dollar will boost its appeal as an alternative asset.  
 “Europe’s problems appear to be ongoing and investors are
losing interest, turning to commodities such as gold and
petrol,” said Vyas Jayabhanu, head of Al Dhafra Financial
Brokerage LLC in Abu Dhabi. In the Gulf, “there is some concern
over second-quarter earnings.” Companies will start announcing
second-quarter earnings next month.  
 Aabar Slumps  
 Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  dropped 0.1 percent, led by
 Aabar Investments PJSC,  as the investment fund’s board said it
will seek shareholder approval to convert into a private joint-
stock company and cancel the Abu Dhabi share listing. Aabar lost
7.1 percent, the most since Nov. 30, to 1.58 dirhams.  
 Agility, the Middle East’s largest storage and logistics
company, plunged 6.8 percent to 345 fils, the lowest since
August 2003. “We feel very strongly and have evidence that the
fraud has continued,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Barbara Nelan
told Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman at a pretrial hearing in a
criminal case against Agility on June 25 in Atlanta.  
 Agility is accused of overcharging the U.S. government on a
multi-billion dollar contract to supply food for troops in
Kuwait and Iraq.  
 Israel’s Bezeq fell 1.4 percent to 8.52 shekels, the lowest
since June 17.  
 In North Africa, Egypt’s  EGX 30 Index  lost 0.3 percent at
the close, trimming an earlier drop of 0.9 percent. Oman’s
benchmark stock  index  slid 0.4 percent, Bahrain’s gauge
decreased 0.5 percent and Qatar’s  QE Index  fell 0.3 percent.
Dubai’s  DFM General Index  retreated 0.4 percent.  
 Israel’s benchmark 6 percent Mimshal Shiklit government
bond dropped 0.06 to 112.84 shekels, while the yield climbed one
basis point to 4.46 percent. The shekel slipped 0.1 percent to
3.8618 against the dollar on June 25.
