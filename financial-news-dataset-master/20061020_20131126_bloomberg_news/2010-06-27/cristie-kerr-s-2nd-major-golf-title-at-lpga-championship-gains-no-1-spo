             Cristie Kerr  of the U.S. won the
LPGA Championship by 12 strokes, a victory that will give her
the No. 1 ranking on the women’s golf tour.  
 Kerr finished at 19-under for the tournament, equaling the
lowest score in relation to par at any women’s major
championship. She led after all four rounds at Locust Hill
Country Club in Pittsford, New York.  
 Kerr’s margin of victory ties the second-largest in a
women’s major, trailing only a 14-shot win by  Louise Suggs  at
the 1949 U.S. Women’s Open.  
 “It’s so awesome, I couldn’t have played better,” Kerr
said in a televised interview after winning her second major
title. She also won the 2007 U.S. Women’s Open.  
 Kerr shot a 6-under-par 66 during the final round and
receives $337,500. She’s the first American to win the LPGA
Championship since  Juli Inkster  in 2000.  
 Kerr is projected to supplant Japan’s  Ai Miyazato  when the
next rankings are released tomorrow, the  LPGA  said on its
website. She’ll be the fourth woman to be No. 1 this year and
the fifth since the rankings started in 2006, following
Miyazato, South Korea’s Jiyai Shin, Mexico’s  Lorena Ochoa  and
Sweden’s  Annika Sorenstam .
