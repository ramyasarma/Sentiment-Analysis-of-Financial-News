             Japan’s sumo association should
suspend 27 members, including Chairman Musashigawa and 15
wrestlers, because of a baseball gambling scandal, the Asahi
newspaper reported, citing a recommendation from an
investigative panel.                               
 Two stable masters and wrestler Kotomitsuki may be fired,
the report said. The action may allow next month’s sumo
tournament to proceed, the Asahi said.  
 The Japan Sumo Association will have an extraordinary
meeting today, the newspaper said.
