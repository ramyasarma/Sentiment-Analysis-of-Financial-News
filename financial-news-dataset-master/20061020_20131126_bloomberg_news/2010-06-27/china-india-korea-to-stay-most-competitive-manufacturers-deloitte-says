             China, India and South Korea will
remain the countries with the most competitive manufacturing
industries over the next five years, Deloitte LLP said.  
 A  global manufacturing competitiveness index  compiled by
Deloitte and the U.S. Council on Competitiveness forecast that
the U.S., Japan and Western Europe would become less competitive
over the next five years, the business advisory firm said today
in an e-mailed statement.  
 “China and India have been emerging as global leaders in
manufacturing for a number of years now, and this survey
highlights the increasing dominance that these two major
economies will continue to have over the remainder of this
decade,” David Raistrick, the head of the U.K. manufacturing
group at Deloitte, said in the statement.  
 The U.S. ranks fourth, behind China, India and South Korea
in the current index, with Brazil fifth and Japan sixth. Germany
is the highest-ranked European nation, in eighth position,
according to the index. Deloitte predicts Brazil will overtake
the U.S. in five years, with Mexico rising to sixth, above
Japan. The U.K. is predicted to drop to 20th from 17th.
