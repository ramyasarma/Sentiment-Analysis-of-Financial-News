             England survived a late batting
collapse to beat Australia by a wicket in the third one-day
cricket match and take an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the series.  
 England surpassed Australia’s 212 all out with five balls
remaining at Old Trafford in Manchester, finishing on 214-9.  
 The home team beat Australia by four wickets in each of the
previous two games in the five-match series, which continues at
the Oval in London on June 30. The series then concludes at
Lord’s before the teams play two Twenty20 internationals.  
 Graeme Swann  took 4-37 and  James Anderson  3-22 as England
bowled out the Australians in 46 overs. Opener  Shane Watson  top-
scored for the visitors with 61.  
 England lost the wicket of Craig Kieswetter in the opening
over of its reply, before a recovery led by captain  Andrew Strauss , who scored 87. When  Eoin Morgan  was dismissed for 27 it
sparked a spell of six wickets for 12 runs, leaving England on
203-9.  
 Tim Bresnan  guided England through with two boundaries to
finish on 14 not out. Anderson didn’t face a ball.
