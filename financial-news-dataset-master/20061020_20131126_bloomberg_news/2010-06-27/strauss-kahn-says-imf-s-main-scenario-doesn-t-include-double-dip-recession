             The International Monetary Fund’s
main economic scenario doesn’t forecast a double-dip recession,
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said today.  
 “The recovery will go on, strong in some parts of the
world, Asia, Latin America, sluggish in Europe, in the middle in
the U.S., and we don’t forecast any double-dip,” Strauss-Kahn
said after the Group of 20 summit in Toronto.
