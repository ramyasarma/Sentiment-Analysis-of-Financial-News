             British Airways Plc union Unite said
it will ballot 11,000 cabin crew about possible strike action
and said the company has made no efforts to resolve “new issues
through negotiation, choosing instead to launch a
confrontational recruitment campaign which will see new crew
employed on poverty pay terms.”  
 A ballot of crew at London’s Heathrow airport will open
tomorrow and run until July 27 and a ballot of Gatwick crew will
follow, also ending on July 27, Unite said.
