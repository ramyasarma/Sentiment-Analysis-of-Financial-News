             Bubba Watson  recorded his first U.S.
PGA Tour win at the Travelers Championship by beating  Scott Verplank  with a par on the second hole of a playoff.  
 Watson, 31, rolled in a four-foot putt on the par-3 16th
hole at the TPC River Highlands golf course in Cromwell,
Connecticut, after Verplank missed his par attempt. Watson
receives $1.08 million for the victory.  
 Watson, who’s tied for the PGA Tour lead in driving
distance with an average of 304.5 yards off the tee, almost
scored an eagle on the first extra hole, the par-4 18th. His
approach shot stopped two inches away from the flag and Verplank
also made birdie to extend the playoff, while  Corey Pavin  was
eliminated.  
 Watson, Verplank and Pavin were tied at 14-under par after
four rounds, one shot better than  Chris Riley  and two ahead of
 Padraig Harrington ,  Retief Goosen ,  Ricky Barnes  and  Chad Campbell .  
 Tiger Woods  is scheduled to play in the next stop on the
tour, the AT&T National at Aronimink Golf Club in Newtown
Square, Pennsylvania. The world’s top-ranked player’s foundation
is hosting the July 1-4 event.
