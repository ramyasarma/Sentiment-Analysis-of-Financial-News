             The affect of the European debt
crisis on China will be “limited in scope,” Yi Xianrong, a
researcher with the Institute of Finance and Banking under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in a commentary
published in today’s China Daily newspaper.  
 The European debt crisis is “very different” from the
2008 financial crisis because it has so far been confined to
smaller European nations, with neither Germany nor France having
been greatly affected, Yi wrote.  
 Economic recovery in the U.S., Japan and other emerging
markets and productivity gains for China’s export-oriented
companies combined to spur increases in exports during the first
five months of this year, Yi wrote.  
 China’s central bank also has “enough ammunition” to
check increases in inflation, Yi wrote. Improved economic
conditions in China and abroad will ease inflation pressures in
the second half of this year, Yi wrote.
