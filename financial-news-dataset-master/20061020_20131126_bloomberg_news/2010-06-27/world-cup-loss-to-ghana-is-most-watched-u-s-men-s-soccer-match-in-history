             The U.S.’s 2-1 loss to Ghana in the
World Cup’s round of 16 was the most watched men’s soccer match
in American history, according to Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN
channel.  
 The June 26 game, which was shown on the ABC channel,
averaged an 8.2 rating, 9.455 million households and 14.9
million viewers, ESPN said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  
 Only the 1999 women’s World Cup final between the U.S. and
China averaged more households and viewers, with 11.307 million
households and 17.975 million viewers. The meeting with Ghana
was also the third highest-rated men’s World Cup game, only
surpassed by the 9.3 rating of the 1994 match between the U.S.
and Brazil, and a 9.5 rating for that year’s final between Italy
and Brazil. The 1999 women’s final had an 11.4 rating.  
 “The U.S.-Ghana match represents increases of 11 percent
in ratings and 13 percent in viewership from ABC’s highly
anticipated U.S.-England World Cup game on June 12, which ended
in a 1-1 draw,” the broadcaster said.  
 San Diego was the top market for the game against Ghana,
with a 15.4 rating. San Diego was the top market for all three
previous U.S. matches.  
 Through 50 games of this year’s World Cup, ESPN, ESPN2 and
ABC are averaging a 1.8 U.S. rating, 2,081,000 households, and
2,781,000 viewers. The rating is 48 percent higher than the last
World Cup in 2006.
