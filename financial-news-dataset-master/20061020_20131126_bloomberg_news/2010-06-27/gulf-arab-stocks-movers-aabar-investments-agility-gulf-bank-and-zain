             Dubai’s  DFM General Index  gained 0.3
percent to 1,543.09 as of 11:29 a.m. in the emirate. Abu Dhabi’s
 measure  slipped 0.1 percent, Kuwait’s  gauge  dropped 0.6 percent
and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  retreated 0.3 percent.  
 The following stocks rose or fell in the Gulf. Symbols are
in parentheses.  
      Aabar Investments PJSC  (AABAR UH) declined 6.5 percent, the
most in three weeks, to 1.59 dirhams. The largest shareholder in
Daimler AG will seek shareholder approval to convert into a
private joint-stock company and cancel its Abu Dhabi listing.  
 Agility (AGLTY KK) retreated 2.7 percent, the most since
June 15, to 360 fils. The Middle East’s largest storage and
logistics company may still be overbilling the U.S. on military
supplies, federal prosecutors said in a pretrial hearing in a
criminal case against Agility.  
 Gulf Bank KSC  (GBK KK) lost the most in almost three weeks,
sliding 3.4 percent to 430 fils. Gulf Bank may allocate 35
million dinars ($120 million) for provisions in the second-
quarter and may report a first-half profit of about 1 million
dinars, Al-Qabas reported, citing unidentified people familiar
with the matter.  
    Mobile Telecommunications Co.  (ZAIN KK) dropped for a
second day, declining 1.8 percent to 1,120 fils. The phone
company known as Zain is in talks with  Emirates
Telecommunications Corp.  to sell a majority stake in Zain Group,
Al-Seyassah reported, without saying where it got the
information. Etisalat wasn’t immediately able to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News today. The company’s shares added
0.5 percent to 10.4 dirhams.  
 Separately, Zain’s unit in Kenya obtained a 3G license, the
country’s Communications Commission said.
