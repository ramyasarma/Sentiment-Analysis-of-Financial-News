             U.S. Senator  Robert Byrd , a Democrat
from West Virginia, is in a Washington area hospital and his
doctors described his condition as “seriously ill,” according
to a statement from his office.  
 Byrd, 92, was admitted late last week, suffering from
apparent heat exhaustion and dehydration, the statement said.
Upon examination, doctors determined that other conditions had
developed which led to his condition being described as
“serious,” the statement said.  
 Byrd, who entered the Senate in 1959 and is the longest-
serving member of the upper house in history, was hospitalized
for two months last year for an undisclosed infection and a
staph infection that his office said he picked up at the
hospital. He was released in July.  
 Byrd led the Senate Appropriations Committee, which
controls funding for government agencies, during Democratic
majorities between 1989 and 2009. He turned over the chairman’s
gavel at the start of President  Barack Obama ’s administration,
amid questions about his health, while remaining a member of the
committee. He was replaced as the panel’s chairman by Senator
 Daniel Inouye , a Hawaii Democrat.  
 As the Senate’s president pro tempore, Byrd is third in
line to the U.S. presidency after the vice president and speaker
of the U.S. House.
