             President  Barack Obama  said the U.S.
expects China’s currency to appreciate as the Chinese government
allows more flexibility and market forces take a bigger role in
setting the value.  
 China’s decision to lift a two-year-old policy of pegging
the yuan to the U.S. dollar and allow its currency to trade more
freely was a first step and the U.S. will monitor progress over
the next “several months,” he said.  
 “We do expect that as more and more market forces come to
bear, that given the enormous surpluses that China has
accumulated, that the renminbi is going to go up and it’s going
to go up significantly,” Obama said in Toronto at a press
conference following a weekend summit of the Group of 20.  
 Obama met yesterday with Chinese President  Hu Jintao  for
talks that included currency and trade. Obama is under pressure
from some lawmakers in the U.S. Congress, who are pressing for
actions, including letting U.S. companies seek tariffs on
Chinese imports.  
 China’s undervalued currency has given it a “significant”
trade advantage, Obama said.  
 The U.S.  trade deficit  with China reached $71 billion for
the first four months of the year, up 5.7 percent from the same
period of 2009, according to U.S. government data.  
 ‘First Step’  
 Obama said it’s in China’s interest to move forward with
its plan, which the U.S. views as a “very positive”
development. Still, Obama said the move was a “first step” and
that Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  will make a
determination on what’s enough over coming months.  
 “We didn’t expect a 20 percent revaluation in a week,”
Obama said. “That would be disruptive to the Chinese economy,
it would be disruptive to the world economy.”  
 Ma Xin, a director general at the National Development and
Reform Commission, China’s top planning agency, said in Toronto
today that economic fundamentals, not foreign pressure, should
determine exchange rates.  
 China ruled out a one-time revaluation of the currency
that’s been held at about 6.83 yuan per dollar since mid-2008.
China’s move to allow more flexibility in the currency triggered
the biggest rise in the yuan in half a decade.  
 The yuan gained 0.5 percent last week, the most since
December 2008. The yuan’s 12-month non-deliverable forwards
declined 0.2 percent to 6.6717, 2 percent stronger than the spot
rate of 6.8063, the smallest premium this week.
