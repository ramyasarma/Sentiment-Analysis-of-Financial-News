             Japanese  stocks  fell, dragging down
the Topix index for a fifth consecutive day, after Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. said it plans to sell new shares and
shipping lines dropped on a slump in freight rates.  
 Mizuho, Japan’s third-biggest bank by market value, slid
2.6 percent. Nippon Yusen K.K., the country’s largest shipping
line, lost 2.1 percent after the Baltic Dry Index of cargo rates
fell for a 21st straight day. Toyota Motor Corp., a carmaker
that gets almost 70 percent of its sales overseas, sank 1.1
percent as the yen traded near its strongest level in five weeks.  
 “Investors are seeing the economic recovery weaken,” said
 Naoteru Teraoka , general manager in the investment unit of
Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $22 billion. “The current level of the yen is raising
concerns that profit of companies reliant on overseas sales may
be hurt.”  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.5 percent to 9,693.94
at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo. The broader Topix slid 0.8
percent to 860.80, with more than twice as many stocks declining
as rising. All but 4 in the Topix’s 33 industry groups dropped.  
 The Topix has lost 5.2 percent this year, cutting the price
of stocks in the gauge to 16.6 times  estimated  earnings. That
compares with 16.4 times on June 9, the cheapest level since
December 2008. About 957.2 billion yen ($10.7 billion) of Topix-
listed shares were traded today, the lowest level since Feb. 16.  
 G-20 Meeting  
 For the quarter, the Nikkei 225 has lost 13 percent and the
Topix has declined 12 percent, their biggest drops since the
quarter ended in December 2008, following the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  
 Group of 20 leaders in Toronto yesterday said banks need to
raise capital “significantly” in order to avoid a repeat of
the global financial crisis. They also endorsed targets to cut
deficits at least by half by 2013 and stabilize their debt-to-
output ratios by 2016, according to a statement.  
 Mizuho  sank 2.6 percent to 149 yen, its lowest close since
Nov. 27. The bank plans to raise as much as 857.6 billion yen by
selling shares to the public, according to a filing with the
finance ministry on June 25. It was Japan’s most-traded stock
today by number of shares.  
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest bank
by market value, dropped 1.9 percent to 411 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., the No. 2, lost 1.9 percent to 2,608 yen.  
 Banks, Shipping Lines  
 Shinsei Bank Ltd. tumbled 4.9 percent to 78 yen, the most
in the Nikkei 225, after Credit Suisse Group AG cut its share-
price estimate to 88 yen from 100 yen. Banks were the second-
largest drag on the Topix among its 33 industries.  
 Shipping lines led percentage declines among the groups
after the  Baltic Dry Index  of shipping costs for commodities
fell on June 25 in its 21st consecutive drop, the longest streak
since April 2009. Nippon Yusen slumped 2.1 percent to 334 yen.
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., which operates the world’s biggest
fleet of merchant shipping vessels, slumped 3.2 percent to 610
yen. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Japan’s third-largest shipping
line, lost 2.6 percent to 375 yen.  
 “Declines in the Baltic Dry Index, a leading indicator of
the economy, reflect the market’s uncertainty about the economic
outlook,” Chuo Mitsui’s Teraoka said.  
 Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, fell 1.1 percent to
3,100 yen, its lowest close since March 2009. Canon Inc., a
camera maker that gets about 80 percent of its sales abroad,
slid 1.1 percent to 3,490 yen, a level not seen since Dec. 2.  
 Tokyo Electron Ltd., which is the world’s second-largest
maker of semiconductor equipment and gets more than 60 percent
of its revenue outside Japan, slumped 2.5 percent to 5,090 yen
and was the  second-heaviest drag  on the Nikkei.  
 Yen Hurts Exporters  
 The yen appreciated to as much as 89.23 against the dollar
today, near its highest level since May 21. A stronger yen
erodes the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  
 Every 1-yen strengthening against the dollar cut Toyota’s
operating profit by 35 billion yen, the company said in February.
Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-biggest carmaker, estimated its
operating profit was reduced by 12 billion yen. Both companies
budgeted an average of 90 yen versus the dollar this fiscal year,
according to their earnings reports.  
 Trend Micro Inc., the world’s third-biggest maker of
security software, sank 1.4 percent to 2,504 yen, its lowest
close since March 2009. First-half pretax profit may fall 20
percent from a year earlier to between 12 billion yen and 13
billion yen, Nikkei English News reported, without saying where
it got the information.
