             Agility  retreated to the lowest
level since 2003 after U.S. federal prosecutors said the Middle
East’s largest storage and logistics company may still be
overbilling the American government for military supplies.  
 The shares lost 6.8 percent to 345 fils, the lowest since
August 2003. The stock has declined 40 percent this year, giving
the company a market value of 361 million dinars.  
 “We feel very strongly and have evidence that the fraud has
continued,” Assistant U.S. Attorney  Barbara Nelan  told
Magistrate Judge  Alan Baverman  at a pretrial hearing in a
criminal case against Agility on June 25 in Atlanta.  
 Agility is accused of overcharging the U.S. government on a
multi-billion dollar contract to supply food for troops in
Kuwait and Iraq. The company is “war-profiting,” Nelan said.
The contract with Agility, formerly known as Public Warehousing
Co., runs until December, Nelan said.  
 In a filing earlier last week, prosecutors accused the
company of being a “fugitive from American justice” that is
trying to evade a trial on charges of overbilling on military
supplies. Agility claims it has not been properly served in the
case.
