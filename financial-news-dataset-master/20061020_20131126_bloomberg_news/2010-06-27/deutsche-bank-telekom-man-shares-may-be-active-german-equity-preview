             German stocks  advanced, halting four
days of declines for the benchmark DAX Index, as Group of 20
leaders said they will focus on supporting economic growth.  
 Infineon Technologies AG advanced 2.8 percent after the
Financial Times Deutschland reported that Chancellor  Angela Merkel  may help Russia’s AFK Sistema broker a possible stake
purchase. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG followed European
carmakers higher, adding more than 2 percent.  
 The  DAX  gained 1.4 percent to 6,157.22 in Frankfurt. The
gauge has climbed 3.4 percent this year as UBS AG and Deutsche
Bank AG advised increasing investments in Germany, Europe’s
largest market, because shares in the country are more geared to
global growth than to Europe’s most-indebted economies. The DAX
is 2.8 percent below its 2010 high reached on April 26, compared
with France’s CAC 40 Index and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index that
remain more than 10 percent below their highest levels in 2010.  
 “The G-20 summit has some impact on today’s market
performance as some investors are relieved that the regulation
won’t be as strong as feared,” said  Christian Falkner , an
analyst at Alpha Wertpapierhandels AG in Frankfurt. “There were
a lot of unknowns around the G-20 and now, after the meeting, I
guess the market has more clarity.”  
 Capital Requirements  
 Global efforts to tighten banking oversight have gained
momentum, U.S. President  Barack Obama  said following the G-20
meeting this weekend. Group leaders agreed to pursue higher
capital requirements for banks once their economic recoveries
take root and endorsed targets to cut deficits by at least half
by 2013 and stabilize their debt-to-output ratios by 2016.  
 German unemployment will decline to the lowest in two
decades by the end of 2011, Bild-Zeitung said, citing Allianz SE
Chief Economist  Michael Heise .  
 Infineon  gained 2.8 percent to 5.09 euros. Merkel  has
agreed to help Russia’s AFK Sistema negotiate with Infineon
about purchasing a stake in the German semiconductor maker,
Financial Times Deutschland reported. Spokesmen at the two
companies said they are not in talks on a stake purchase.  
 BMW, the world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, rose 2.2
percent to 41.26 euros.  
 Daimler Gains  
 Daimler  climbed 2.9 percent to 43.22 euros, ending four
days of declines. The carmaker targets 8 percent growth at its
bus division this year on demand in Asia and Latin America, Die
Welt reported, citing an interview with  Hartmut Schick , the
unit’s chief.  
 Aareal Bank AG  gained 5.8 percent to 14.70 euros as the
German commercial property lender said it will transfer 150
million euros ($184 million) to Germany’s bank rescue fund,
Soffin, beginning repayment of the aid earlier than planned.  
 Delticom AG climbed 3.2 percent to 37.77 euros after
raising its target for earnings before interest and taxes in
2010 to 9 percent from 8 percent and sticking to its full-year
sales forecast.  
 Bauer AG  gained 3.6 percent to 28.76 euros as Berenberg
Bank lifted its recommendation to “buy“ from “hold“ on the
construction company.  
 Q-Cells SE and  Solarworld AG  lost 5.2 percent to 5.55 euros
and 2.3 percent to 9.80 euros, respectively, as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. recommended selling the shares of the solar
companies.
