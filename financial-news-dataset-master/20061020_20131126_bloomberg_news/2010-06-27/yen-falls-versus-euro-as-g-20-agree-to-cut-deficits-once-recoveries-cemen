             The yen fell for the first time in
seven days against the euro after Group of 20 leaders endorsed
targets to reduce deficits once their economic recoveries are
cemented, curbing demand for safe-haven currencies.  
 Japan’s currency weakened against 15 of its 16 major
counterparts after the G-20 said advanced economies will aim to
at least halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize debt-to-output
ratios by 2016. The dollar touched the lowest level in almost
eight weeks against Switzerland’s franc before U.S. reports this
week that economists said will show consumer confidence weakened
and manufacturing growth slowed this month.  
 “The G-20 statement has Europe’s desire for deficit cuts
and the U.S.’s for maintenance of economic stimulus, which
satisfies both of them,” said  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency
dealer at Okasan Securities Co. Ltd. in Tokyo. “There’s some
talk of investors looking to sell the yen.”  
 The yen declined to 110.68 per euro at 6:46 a.m. in London
from 110.41 in New York on June 25. The yen was at 89.42 per
dollar from 89.23 last week, when it rose to 89.22, the
strongest since May 21. The euro bought $1.2380 from $1.2369.
The dollar was at 1.0928 francs from 1.0929, after earlier
weakening to 1.0897, the lowest since May 4.  
 South Korea’s won led Asian currencies higher as the  MSCI 
Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index of shares climbed 0.6
percent. The won strengthened 1 percent to 1,202.95 per dollar
and the Malaysian ringgit rose 0.7 percent to 3.2285.  
 G-20 Meeting  
 Banks need to raise capital “significantly” and countries
will be allowed to phase in new rules, with a goal of meeting
the standards by the end of 2012, G-20 leaders said in a
statement yesterday at the close of their meeting in Toronto.  
 “Honestly, this is more than I expected, because it is
quite specific,” German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said,
referring to the fiscal targets. “It’s a success that
industrialized countries as a group accepted this.”  
 U.S. President  Barack Obama  said the goal set by the G-20
of cutting deficits in half by 2013 reflects U.S. targets and
takes into account the fiscal and economic needs of each nation.  
 The euro rose for a fourth day against the dollar as
traders judged this quarter’s 8.4 percent slide was overdone.  
 “We’ve clearly had a big move down as far as the euro-
dollar exchange rate is concerned,” said  Ray Attrill , global
research director in Sydney at Forecast Ltd., in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “There’s almost like a will in the
marketplace to see some stabilization here, so I wouldn’t be
surprised if the euro-dollar exchange rate behaves in a
relatively benign way in the next month or two.”  
 Euro Wagers  
 The  difference  in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- rose to 70,974 on
June 22, from 62,360 a week earlier.  
 Australia’s dollar gained for a second day versus its U.S.
counterpart on speculation weaker U.S. data will delay any
withdrawal of stimulus measures by the Federal Reserve,
prompting investors to buy higher-yielding assets.  
 “There seems to be a reawakening of concerns over how
strong the U.S. upturn really is and that’s taking a toll on
U.S. bond yields and the dollar,” said  Mike Jones , a currency
strategist at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in Wellington. “Further
disappointments in U.S. data could see the dollar slide,
providing a boost for the likes of the kiwi and Aussie dollar.”  
 Australia’s currency climbed to 87.50 U.S. cents from 87.41
cents on June 25, and was at 78.23 yen from 78.02 yen.  
 U.S. Data  
 The Conference Board’s confidence index in the U.S. fell to
62.9 in June from 63.3 in May, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists before the New York-based group’s report
tomorrow. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing
gauge declined to 59.0 in June from 59.7 in May, another
Bloomberg survey showed before the report is released on July 1.  
 Benchmark interest rates are 4.5 percent in  Australia  and
2.75 percent in New Zealand, compared with 0.1 percent in  Japan 
and as low as zero in the U.S., attracting investors to the
South Pacific nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such
trades is that currency market moves will erase profits.  
 The won rose for the first time in five days as South
Korean Finance Minister  Yoon Jeung Hyun  said after the market
closed on June 25 that the global economy has recovered from the
financial crisis faster than previously expected.  
 “Risk sentiment is improving,” said  Daniel Yoon , general
manager at Eugene Futures Co. in Seoul. “It seems like
investors are done covering their short positions. Exporters
will also repatriate income as we near the end of the month.”
