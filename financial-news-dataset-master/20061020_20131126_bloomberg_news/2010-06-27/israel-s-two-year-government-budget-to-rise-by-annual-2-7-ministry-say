             Israel’s government budget will
increase by 2.7 percent annually in 2011 and 2012, according to
a plan presented by Finance Minister  Yuval Steinitz  to the
Cabinet today.  
 The budget deficit will be 3 percent of gross domestic
product in 2011 and 2 percent in 2012, according to the plan.
This will leave the economy with a “safety net” in the event
that the global crisis worsens, Steinitz told the Cabinet,
according to an e-mailed statement from the ministry.  
 “We are still in an environment of economic uncertainty
due to the global crisis, which isn’t over,” Steinitz said.
“While Israel managed relatively well with the global crisis we
need to continue to stick to the fiscal rules that we set for
ourselves.”  
 The government passed a two-year budget for the first time
in July 2009 after it failed to approve a spending plan before
elections were held. Steinitz decided to enact a two-year budget
again, saying it helped government ministries plan ahead and
freed up time to concentrate on other issues.  
 Under a new rule approved in March, the yearly spending
ceiling will be a function of government debt and average  gross
domestic product  over the past 10 years. Until now, spending was
generally permitted to rise by 1.7 percent yearly.  
 “The whole world is cutting their budgets, lowering
salaries, and raising taxes,” Steinitz said. “We can allow
ourselves to increase our budget a little bit but it is clear
that we won’t be able to respond to all of the demands of the
various government ministries,” Steinitz said.
