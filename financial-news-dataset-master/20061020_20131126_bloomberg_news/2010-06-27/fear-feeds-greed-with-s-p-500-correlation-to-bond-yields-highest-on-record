             U.S. stock prices are  mirroring 
government bond yields more than ever, a signal to bulls that
shares may be poised to rally.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  and 10-year Treasury  rates 
posted a correlation coefficient of 0.8412 in the 60 trading
days through June 16, showing stock prices and bond yields were
the most linked in Bloomberg data going back to 1962. The last
time the relationship was almost this strong during an economic
expansion was at the beginning of the 2002 to 2007  bull market ,
when the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities doubled.  
 Rising correlations show investors are ignoring relative
values among industries and assets and reacting to day-to-day
signals on the economy, convinced Europe’s debt crisis will spur
the second global contraction in three years. Invesco Ltd.,
Wells Capital Management Inc. and Chemung Canal Trust Co., who
together manage $957 billion, say those concerns are overblown
and shares will advance as the fastest profit growth since the
mid-1990s restores confidence.  
 “When you add up the fundamentals, they’re there,” said
 Fritz Meyer , a Denver-based senior market strategist at Invesco,
which oversees $580 billion. “The problem is this emotional
aspect,” he said. “The historical truth in the stock market is
you want to buy stocks when there’s skepticism and fear all over
the place and sell when everyone’s feeling complacent.”  
 Deflation Threat  
 The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,074.57 at 4 p.m. in New
York today, as declines in oil and metal prices dragged down
commodity producers. The gauge lost 3.7 percent to 1,076.76 last
week after new-home sales sank to a record low and the Federal
Reserve signaled that European indebtedness may lead to a weaker
U.S. economy. Deflation, or a general decline in prices, is
possible within the next few years, Nobel Prize-winning
economist  Paul Krugman  said at a June 22 conference in Tel Aviv.  
 When the S&P 500 dropped 3.9 percent on May 20 following
higher-than-forecast U.S. jobless claims, yields on 10-year
Treasuries plunged 0.156 percentage point. The stock index slid
3.4 percent and the rate on notes fell 0.162 point on June 4,
after employment growth trailed economists’ estimates.  
 Commodity Prices  
 Equities are also moving in lockstep with each other and
assets tied to economic growth. The correlation coefficient
 between  the S&P 500 and the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index
of 19 raw materials has been above 0.5 since April 13 and
climbed to 0.77 on May 14, the highest since at least 1956, data
compiled by Bloomberg using 30 days of trading show. Almost 80
percent of swings in stocks within the S&P 500 are related to
 movements  in the broader market, according to London-based
Barclays Plc.  
 “Correlation is one of the great lessons of the whole
crisis, and it hasn’t let its grip on the markets go,” said
 Barry Knapp , the New York-based head of U.S. equity strategy for
Barclays. Knapp estimates the S&P 500 will climb 13 percent to
end the year at 1,210. “Whatever the nature of the crisis, the
one decision investors seem to make is whether they should be in
risky assets or out.”  
 Linkages among markets are so high because investors are
worried about a repeat of the 2008 credit crisis, which sent
U.S. equities, commodities and real estate prices to their worst
losses in half a century, Knapp said. The  correlation  level
between the U.S. equity benchmark and 10-year Treasury yields
averaged 0.5711 from October 2007 through March 2009, when the
S&P 500 plunged 57 percent.  
 Home Sales  
 Reports on sales of new and previously owned homes last
week showed that purchases reversed course in May after getting
a bump higher from government stimulus programs including a
buyer tax credit. About half of 106 U.S. forecasters in a study
from Madison, New Jersey-based MacroMarkets LLC expect price
declines in 2010 and half anticipate either little-changed or
increasing values.  
 Congressional negotiators approved the most sweeping
overhaul of U.S. financial regulation since the Great Depression
on June 25. Financial companies in the S&P 500 rose 2.8 percent
after the bill was announced as analysts said it won’t
fundamentally reshape Wall Street’s biggest firms. The S&P 500
has lost 5.6 percent since President  Barack Obama  proposed
banning proprietary trading by banks on Jan. 21.  
 ‘Very Worried’  
 “Investors are very worried about which direction the
global economy is going to take,” said  Bart Zeldenrust , senior
fund manager at Rotterdam-based Robeco Group, which oversees
about $167 billion. “Correlation was very high during the
financial crisis because there was only one bet that you could
make in your portfolio: risk is on or risk is off. And it’s
still very much so. It’s not a good sign.”  
 The lockstep moves are hurting strategies designed to
smooth out  fluctuations  across equities, industries and assets.
Standard deviation, a measure of the variation in returns, for
mutual funds investing in the biggest U.S. companies that have
an average value  similar  to the S&P 500 fell to 5.8 percent in
the first quarter, based on data compiled by Lipper & Co. and
Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level in three years.  
 “It’s been impossible for stock pickers lately,”  Savita Subramanian , quantitative strategist at Bank of America Corp. in
New York. “It’s been less about stock selection, less about
fundamentals or company management, and it’s been all about
macro.”  
 $1.78 Trillion Lost  
 U.S. equity markets have lost more than $1.78 trillion
since April 23 on concern the European debt crisis will spread.
 Ryan Caldwell , whose $20.7 billion  Ivy Asset Strategy Fund  has
beaten more than 98 percent of rivals in the past five years,
said the S&P 500 will rebound from May’s 8.2 percent loss should
concerns about deficits in Greece, Portugal and Spain subside.  
 “No matter what you’re doing on the stock-picking portion
of the portfolio now, it’s clearly being trumped by the macro
environment,” said Caldwell, a fund manager for Overland Park,
Kansas-based Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. “If you see the
macro worries recede, I think you’ll see a pretty quick recovery
in asset prices.”  
 Periods of risk aversion, when investors sell  volatile 
assets and buy securities perceived as havens, have lasted an
average of two months in the past, according to data since the
1930s compiled by Deutsche Bank AG. That suggests stocks will
start rebounding in mid-July, says  Binky Chadha , the firm’s New
York-based chief U.S. equity strategist, who predicts the S&P
500 will rise 28 percent to end the year at 1,375.  
 Expanding Economy  
 The last time movements between Treasury yields and stocks
were this similar during an economic expansion was in October
2002. The S&P 500  jumped  34 percent in the next 12 months and
another 51 percent through October 2007 as corporate earnings
recovered from the bursting of the technology bubble. U.S. gross
domestic product grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the quarter
that ended Sept. 30, 2002, compared with 2.7 percent in the
first three months of this year.  
 “The market is worried about deflation and depression,”
said  James Paulsen , who helps oversee about $375 billion as
chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in
Minneapolis. “For this correlation to go away, you’re going to
have to first have confidence the recovery is sustainable, which
means stocks go up.”  
 Economists predict a 3.2 percent expansion in U.S. GDP this
year, the biggest since 2004, according to estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Earnings for S&P 500 companies may rise 32 percent in
2010 and 17 percent in 2011, the largest two-year advance since
the period ended in 1995. The index is trading for 13.1 times
forecasted 2010 earnings, compared with an average multiple of
about 16.4 since 1954 using  reported profit , the data show.  
 May Losses  
 McDonald’s Corp.  may rally once investors’ focus returns to
earnings and valuation, said  Tom Wirth , senior investment
officer for Chemung Canal, which manages $1.6 billion in Elmira,
New York. Shares of the world’s largest restaurant operator fell
5.3 percent in May as the S&P 500 dropped 8.2 percent. The Oak
Brook, Illinois-based company beat estimates for the quarter
ended March 31 and said this month that May global sales rose
more than analysts projected. Its dividend yield is 3.27
percent, compared with 3.02 percent for the 10-year Treasury.  
 “When fear enters the market, then you sell first and ask
questions later,” Wirth said. “Investing is for the long term,
so if you can buy high-quality stocks at these prices, you do
it. If they’re high-quality companies, they’ll come back.”
