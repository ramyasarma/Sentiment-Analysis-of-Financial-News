             “Toy Story 3” was the top film in
the U.S. and Canada for the second straight weekend, bringing in
$59 million in ticket sales for  Walt Disney Co.’s  Pixar Studio,
while the  Tom Cruise  action-comedy “Knight and Day” debuted in
a disappointing third place, an analyst said.  
 “Grown Ups” opened in second place with $41 million for
 Sony Corp. , Hollywood.com Box-Office said today in an e-mailed
statement.  
 “Toy Story 3”  has pulled in $226.6 million since its June
18 release, Hollywood.com said. The 3-D sequel brings back the
voices of  Tom Hanks  as Woody and  Tim Allen  as Buzz Lightyear and
introduces several new toys, including a villainous bear that
smells of strawberries, voiced by Ned Beatty. Sales have
benefited from the higher prices cinemas charge for 3-D movies,
which are on average about $3 more per ticket.  
 “For a Pixar film, that’s the most money ever made in a
second weekend,” said  Jeff Bock , senior box office analyst with
Los Angeles-based Exhibitor Relations. “Despite a drop, it’s
still a remarkable run in 10 days.’  
 In “Grown Ups,”  Adam Sandler ,  Kevin James ,  Chris Rock  and
 David Spade  play a group of childhood friends, once teammates on
a championship basketball team, who reunite for a Fourth of July
holiday weekend.  
 “Knight and Day,” which opened with $20.5 million for
 News Corp.’s  Fox film studio, stars Cruise and  Cameron Diaz  as a
fugitive couple racing across the globe.  
 ‘Disappointment’  
 “That’s a big disappointment, especially for what was
supposed to be a reboot of Tom Cruise’s career,” Bock said.
“For Fox to release this just 10 days after the A-Team is
ridiculous. It’s another action-comedy.”  
 “The Karate Kid,” a remake of the 1984 film, fell to
fourth place from second with $15.4 million for Sony. The film,
starring  Jackie Chan  and Jaden Smith, has collected $135.6
million in three weeks of release.  
 “The A-Team” dropped to fifth place from third with $6
million for Fox.  Liam Neeson  stars as Hannibal Smith and mixed-
martial arts athlete Quinton “Rampage” Jackson plays B.A.
Baracus in an update of the 1980s television series.  
 Ahead of next weekend’s U.S. Independence Day holiday,
Summit Entertainment LLC will open “The Twilight Saga:
Eclipse” on June 30. “The Last Airbender,” a fantasy directed
by  M. Night Shyamalan , debuts July 1 for  Viacom Inc.’s  Paramount
Pictures.  
 Weekend sales for the top 12 films fell to $156.8 million
from $192.8 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com said. Year-to-
date receipts total $5.2 billion, up 2 percent from $5.1
billion. Attendance has fallen 4.3 percent this year.  
 The following table has figures provided by studios to Los
Angeles-based Hollywood.com. The amounts are based on actual
