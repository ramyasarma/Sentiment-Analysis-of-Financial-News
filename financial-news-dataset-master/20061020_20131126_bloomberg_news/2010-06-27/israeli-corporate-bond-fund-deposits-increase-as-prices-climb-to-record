             Israeli corporate-bond funds
received inflows of about 310 million shekels ($80.3 million)
last week, double the previous week, as prices rallied to a
record, according to Meitav Investments & Securities Ltd.  
 Israelis deposited the highest weekly amount in three
months last week, bringing total deposits since the beginning of
the month to 500 million shekels, Tel Aviv-based Meitav said
today in an e-mailed report. Investors were also net depositors
of 80 million shekels in stock funds, Meitav said. The  TA-25
benchmark index of stocks  fell 1.2 percent last week.  
 “The issuances came as corporate bonds continued to
experience sharp increases,” Meitav said in an e-mailed
statement.  
 The  Tel-Bond 40 Index , a corporate bonds gauge, rose 0.6
percent last week, reaching a record of 251.10 on June 23. It
fell 0.1 percent to 250.36 as of 1:29 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  
 Israel’s economy expanded an annualized 3.6 percent in the
first quarter, led by exports. Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  has raised rates by 1 percentage point since August as
the country emerged from the global recession.  
 Fischer is expected to leave the benchmark lending rate
unchanged at 1.5 percent for a third month at the next rate-
setting meeting, according to 10 of 18 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The eight others believe it will rise to 1.75
percent. The central bank will make its announcement at 5:30
p.m. in Jerusalem tomorrow.  
 Israel’s benchmark 6 percent Mimshal Shiklit government
bond was unchanged at 112.90 shekels, yielding 4.45 percent. The
shekel slipped 0.1 percent to 3.8618 against the dollar on June
25.
