             Iron Ore Holdings Ltd. and Rio Tinto
Group haven’t agreed to terms of access in negotiations over
their ore sales agreement covering production from the Phil’s
Creek project. If the companies are unable to agree to terms of
access by Aug. 8 then the sales agreement will terminate, Iron
Ore Holdings said in a regulatory filing.  
 Iron Ore Holdings also said it’s reviewing the financial
viability of the Phil’s Creek mining operations, given changes
in economic parameters since the ore sales agreement was entered
into.
