             Gulf Arab investors will
increasingly look for opportunities outside the region, with
deals in emerging markets and real estate helping to diversify
holdings, an official at  Credit Suisse Group AG  said.  
 After 2001, Middle East investors began looking at their
home markets, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, “and as a result outbound investments went from about
65 percent to less than 40 percent today,”  Bassam Yammine , a
managing director and joint chief executive officer for the
Middle East at  Credit Suisse , said in an interview in Dubai.
That ratio “will eventually balance out,” he said.  
 Investors in the region “need to diversify” and are also
more interested now in some emerging markets of Asia and Latin
America, where growth and wealth creation has been “robust”
and investors “want to participate in that shift,” Yammine
said.  
 Gulf Arab countries, which also include Kuwait, Qatar,
Bahrain and Oman, pump more than 20 percent of the world’s crude
oil and a quadrupling of oil prices in the past eight years is
helping boost wealth across the region. The Middle East has more
than 400,000 millionaires and their combined wealth grew 7.1
percent in 2009 to $1.5 trillion, according to a report by Cap
Gemini SA and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit.  
 The Qatar Investment Authority, the Persian Gulf country’s
sovereign wealth fund, this month agreed to invest $2.8 billion
in the Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.’s initial public
offering. Kuwait Investment Authority, the wealth fund in
neighboring Kuwait, said it would buy $800 million of stock.  
 Real Estate  
 The Qatar wealth fund has also been buying up properties in
London to take advantage of lower prices and the pound’s
weakness. Barwa Real Estate Co., controlled by the fund, on June
17 agreed to buy Park House, an office and retail development on
London’s Oxford Street, for 250 million pounds ($370 million).  
 The fund also bought London’s Harrods department store last
month and in 2009 became the largest investor in Songbird
Estates Plc, which owns most of the Canary Wharf office estate.  
 “Real estate will be one important destination” for
investment, Yammine said. “People in the Middle East like real
estate, they are comfortable with it, it is tangible.”  
 Credit Suisse has about 250 employees across the Middle
East with offices in eight cities in the region and was an
adviser to the Qatar Investment Authority in its purchase of
Harrods.
