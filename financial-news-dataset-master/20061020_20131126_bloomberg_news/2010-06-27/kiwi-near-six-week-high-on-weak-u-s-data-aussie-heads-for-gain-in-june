             The New Zealand dollar weakened from
near a six-week high versus its U.S. counterpart and dropped the
most in almost three weeks against Australia’s currency as
business confidence in the smaller South Pacific economy fell.  
 The Australian dollar slipped after rising earlier on
speculation Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  may compromise on a
proposed mining tax after ousting  Kevin Rudd  last week. The
currency is headed for an advance this month against the
greenback before U.S. reports this week economists say will show
consumer confidence weakened and employers cut jobs this month.  
 “The flow of data points to a more dovish outlook from the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand,” said  Adrian Foster , head of
financial-markets research for Asia at Rabobank Groep NV in Hong
Kong. “At times when the global picture looks dimmer, you’d
expect the New Zealand dollar to underperform.”  
 New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fell 0.8 percent
to 70.86 U.S. cents at 1:53 p.m. in New York, from 71.40 on June
25, paring this month’s gain to 4.1 percent. It touched 71.60
U.S. cents on June 23, its strongest level since May 13. It fell
0.6 percent to 63.35 yen.  
 Australia’s currency declined 0.2 percent to 87.24 U.S.
cents, from 87.41 cents, and is set to advance 3.1 percent in
June. The currency was little changed at 77.99 yen.  
 The kiwi fell 0.5 percent versus the Australian dollar, the
most on a closing basis since June 8, to NZ$1.2311.  
 Confidence Drops  
 A net 38.5 percent of New Zealand companies surveyed expect
sales and profits will increase over the next 12 months, down
from 45.3 percent in May, according to a survey by ANZ National
Bank Ltd. released today. The net figure subtracts the number of
pessimists from the number of optimists.  
 In the U.S., the Conference Board’s  confidence index  fell
to a reading of 62.5 in June from 63.3 in May, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists before the report tomorrow.
U.S. employers eliminated 115,000 jobs in June, according to the
median forecast of 73 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before the Labor Department releases the data on July 2.  
 U.S. Treasury two-year yields touched the  lowest level  in
2010 today, 0.62 percent, on speculation the economic recovery
will remain slow.
