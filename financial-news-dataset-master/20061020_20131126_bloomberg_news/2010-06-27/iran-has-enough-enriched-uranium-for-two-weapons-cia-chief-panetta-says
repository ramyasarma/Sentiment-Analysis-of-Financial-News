             Iran has enough enriched uranium to
produce two nuclear weapons, CIA Director Leon Panetta said
today.  
 “They clearly are developing their nuclear capability and
that raises concerns,” Panetta said on ABC’s “This Week”
program. “We think they have enough low-enriched uranium right
now for two weapons.”  
 Israeli officials “feel more strongly that Iran has already
made the decision to proceed with the bomb,” Panetta said. The
Israelis “are willing to give us the room to try to change Iran
diplomatically and culturally and politically.”
