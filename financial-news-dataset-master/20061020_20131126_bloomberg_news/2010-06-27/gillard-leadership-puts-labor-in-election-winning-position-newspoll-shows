             Australian Prime Minister Julia
Gillard put Labor in an election-winning position after ousting
Kevin Rudd last week and pledging to forge a deal on the planned
mining tax, a Newspoll opinion survey shows.  
 Labor leads the opposition Liberal-National coalition 53 to
47 on a two-party preferred basis, according to the telephone
survey of 1,142 people between June 25 and June 27 published in
the Australian newspaper. The margin of error is 3 percentage
points. Some 53 percent preferred Gillard as prime minister,
compared with 29 percent for opposition leader Tony Abbott.
