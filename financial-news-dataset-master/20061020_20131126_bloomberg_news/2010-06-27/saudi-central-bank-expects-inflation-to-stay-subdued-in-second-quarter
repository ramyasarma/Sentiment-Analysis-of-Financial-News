             Saudi Arabia’s  central bank  expects
no acute inflationary pressures in the second quarter, according
to a report released on its website.  
 Inflation slowed to a quarterly 1.1 percent in the January-
March period, from 1.5 percent in the final three months of
2009, the bank said. The slowdown came as price increases for
imports and rents subsided, it said.  
 Inflation is expected to remain at a similar level in the
second quarter, led by rents, fuel, water and food and
beverages, the report said.
