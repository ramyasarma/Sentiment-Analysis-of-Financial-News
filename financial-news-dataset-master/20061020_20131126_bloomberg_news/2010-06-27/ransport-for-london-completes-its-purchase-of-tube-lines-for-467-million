             Transport for London completed its
acquisition of Tube Lines Ltd., buying the shares from Bechtel
Corp. and  Ferrovial SA ’s  Amey  unit for 310 million pounds ($467
million).  
 The deal makes Tube Lines a wholly owned unit of TFL and
“allows greater flexibility in the delivery of tube upgrades,”
the company said in a statement today.  
 London Underground will complete an upgrade of the Jubilee
line as soon as possible, find the best way to improve the
Northern and Piccadilly lines and continue with the
modernizations of the Victoria, Circle, District, Hammersmith &
City and Metropolitan lines, TFL said.  
 “The capital is the engine room of the U.K. economy and
this new arrangement ensures that the vital tube upgrade work,
upon which London’s own economic success depends, is delivered
at the best possible value,” London Mayor  Boris Johnson  said in
the statement.  
 TFL also entered into agreements to restructure 1.75
billion pounds of Tube Lines (Finance) Plc’s debt, it said in a
separate statement. Of the amount due, 1.62 billion pounds will
be directly guaranteed and the remaining 135 million pounds will
be redeemed at par, TFL said.
