             Australian Prime Minister Julia
Gillard may exclude former leader Kevin Rudd from her cabinet,
the Australian newspaper reported, citing Labor party sources.
Gillard was due to speak to Rudd last night and isn’t expected
to name any new faces when she announces her ministerial lineup
today, meaning Mark Arbib and Bill Shorten are unlikely to be
rewarded for their role in the decision to strip Rudd of the
prime ministership, according to the newspaper.
