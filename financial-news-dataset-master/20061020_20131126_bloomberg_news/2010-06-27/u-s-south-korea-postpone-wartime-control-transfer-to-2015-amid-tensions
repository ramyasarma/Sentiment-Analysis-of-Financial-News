             South Korea agreed with the U.S. to
delay a planned handover of “wartime control” in the event of
a military conflict to Dec. 1, 2015, from April 2012 amid
heightened tensions with North Korea.  
 South Korea’s presidential office announced on its website
today that the agreement was reached at a meeting between South
Korean President  Lee Myung Bak  and U.S. President  Barack Obama 
in Toronto, Canada, on the sidelines of the summit of Group of
20 nations.  
 South Korea was scheduled to take over the right to control
its forces in the event of a war in April 2012 under a 2007
agreement with the U.S. The U.S. had full control of South
Korea’s forces during the 1950-53 Korean War and until 1994,
when the Asian nation was given operational control during
peacetime.  
 “The move underlines South Korea’s dependence on the U.S.,
which will result in greater U.S. influence on South Korea’s
foreign policy,” said Kim Yong Hyun, professor of North Korean
studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. “It will also make
others doubt about the capabilities of South Korea’s military.”  
 South Korea has remained technically at war with North
Korea since the war ended in a cease-fire that was never
replaced by a peace treaty. South Korea’s 680,000-strong
military faces off with as many as 1.2 million troops across the
border in  North Korea , which has built atomic bombs and long-
range ballistic missiles.  
 Away From Border  
 The U.S. has about 28,500 troops in the South and is in the
process of moving them away from the border.  
 The accord came after South Korea blamed North Korea for
sinking the 1,200-ton Cheonan on March 26, killing 46 sailors.
South Korea, backed by the U.S., is pushing for United Nations
Security Council condemnation of North Korea.  
 China, which holds veto power on the Security Council, has
refrained from criticizing  Kim Jong Il ’s regime for the attack.
China, which fought on North Korea’s side during the war, is
also the country’s largest trading partner and political ally.
