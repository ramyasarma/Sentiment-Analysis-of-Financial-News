             General Motors Co., the biggest U.S.
automaker, and its South Korean unit GM Daewoo Auto & Technology
Co. will recall more than 2,000 vehicles in Korea due to a
manufacturing defect.  
 A total of 2,154 vehicles produced between 2005 and 2008
will be subject to the recall starting tomorrow, the Ministry of
Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs said in a statement today.  
 A defect was found in the vehicles’ windshield wiper fluid
system, produced by Micro-Heat Inc., which can cause wipers to
catch fire, the ministry said.  
 The recalls will include 1,314 GM Daewoo-produced Veritas
large sedans and the U.S. automaker’s Cadillac CTS, DTS and
Escalade models, it said.  
 GM said earlier this month that it is recalling 1.53
million cars and trucks worldwide for a similar problem.
