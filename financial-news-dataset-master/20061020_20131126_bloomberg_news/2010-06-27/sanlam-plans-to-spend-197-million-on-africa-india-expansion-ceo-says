             Sanlam Ltd.,  the largest South
Africa-based insurer, said it will spend as much as 1.5 billion
rand ($197 million) expanding its business in Africa and India.  
 “We have earmarked 500 million rand for India, 500 million
rand for Africa and 500 million rand for bolt-ons,” Chief
Executive Officer  Johan van Zyl  said in an interview at the
Fortune Global Forum in Cape Town today. The insurance company,
with a presence in 12 African countries, will still have about
1.5 billion rand “in the kitty,” he said.  
 Sanlam managed to double its profit last year even as the
global financial crisis caused other insurers, such as South
African rival  Old Mutual Plc  to dip into losses. Shareholders
have been asking what the company, which has excess capital,
will do with the money, some of them hoping for a special
dividend.  
 While Sanlam has bought back shares, it is not planning a
special dividend and remains cautious even as competitors like
 Liberty Holdings Ltd.  have benefitted from the backing of a
controlling bank with a large balance sheet, van Zyl said.  
 Shareholders may be rewarded if Sanlam found a foreign
partner, Van Zyl said. The large European insurers don’t “see
growth” in their own markets, he said, declining to name which
companies Sanlam has held talks with.  
 “I’m not interested in the British insurers and there are
no immediate plans,” he added.
