             Kuwait Projects Co., the country’s
biggest privately owned investment firm, will start meeting
fixed-income investors from this week, a company official said.  
 The meetings, scheduled to start on June 30, are being
arranged by BNP Paribas, Citigroup Inc and HSBC Holdings Plc,
the company’s Group Treasurer Declan Sawey said in a phone
interview today. “If we did a deal, then we will use the
proceeds for the general corporate purposes and to extend
maturities” of debt, he said.  
 The meetings will be held in Hong Kong, Singapore, Middle
East and Europe, he said. Kuwait Projects currently has a $2
billion euro medium-term note program, Sawey said.
