             At least 381 people have died in
floods in southern China this year and 143 others are missing,
the Ministry of Water Resources said today, as the Jiujiang
River flooded the most in seven years.  
 Floods have caused an estimated economic loss of about 83.8
billion yuan ($12.3 billion) in 2010 and have displaced 4.66
million people, the ministry said on its website, citing the
Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.  
 Provinces including Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi and Zhejiang
are experiencing further flooding after heavy rain yesterday, it
said. The Jiujiang River, which joins the Yangtze River in
southern China’s Hunan Province, today recorded its biggest
flood since 2003, the ministry said.  
 Floods in 2010 have affected 70 million people in 22
provinces, municipalities and regions, as well as inundating
about 4.5 million hectares (11.1 million acres) of crops, it
said.
