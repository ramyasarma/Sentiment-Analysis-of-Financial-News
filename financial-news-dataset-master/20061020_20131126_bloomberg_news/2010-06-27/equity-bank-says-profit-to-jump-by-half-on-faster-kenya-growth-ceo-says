             Equity Bank Ltd. , Kenya’s biggest
lender by customers, expects profits to increase by more than
half this year, benefiting from faster growth in East Africa’s
largest economy and investments in Uganda and Southern Sudan.  
 “The macroeconomic environment is very suitable,” Chief
Executive Officer  James Mwangi  said in an interview at the
 Fortune Global Forum  in Cape Town yesterday. “Increased
activity is leading that growth.”  
 Equity Bank is aiming to expand into Rwanda, Tanzania and
Burundi as East African nations move toward a free-trade area,
allowing for easier movement of capital, Mwangi said. The
Nairobi-based lender has four branches in Southern Sudan and 45
in Uganda.  
 “We are optimistic for this year to deliver growth rates
in the bottom line in excess of 50 percent,” Mwangi said. “We
are reaping the benefits of past investments. We have Sudan
becoming profitable and we are also seeing growth in Uganda
now.”  
 A bumper agricultural harvest is boosting economic growth
in Kenya, the world’s largest exporter of black tea. The economy
will probably expand 4.5 percent this year and 5.7 percent in
2011, up from 2.6 percent in 2009, Finance Minister Uhuru
Kenyatta said on June 10.  
 Equity Bank posted an 8.2 percent increase in profit in the
year through Dec. 31.
