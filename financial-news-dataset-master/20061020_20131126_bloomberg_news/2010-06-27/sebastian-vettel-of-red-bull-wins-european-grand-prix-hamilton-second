             Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull won
today’s European Grand Prix in Valencia from pole position.  
 McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton was second, to keep his lead in
the Formula One drivers’ standings. His teammate Jenson Button
finished third, though he may face punishment for an
infringement during the race.  
 Mark Webber of Red Bull crashed out after a spectacular
collision with Heikki Kovalainen’s Lotus.  
 Hamilton, third on the grid, started by overtaking Webber
in the opening seconds to go second while the Australian soon
dropped back to ninth. Then a slow pit stop for tires set Webber
back further before the crash put him out of the race on the 10th
lap of 57.  
 His car hit the back of Kovalainen’s, flew into the air,
flipped upside down and crashed into the trackside tire wall.
Webber was able to walk away from the incident, as the safety
car came on to the track.  
 Hamilton was penalized with a drive-through penalty for
overtaking the safety car, but was still able to keep second
place behind Vettel.  
 As the race entered the final laps, Hamilton narrowed the
gap on Vettel but was unable to create an overtaking
opportunity.  
 It was the eighth time from nine races this season that Red
Bull has been on pole, and the team’s fourth win of the season.  
 The next race in a 19-event series, the British Prix, is at
Silverstone, England, on July 11.
