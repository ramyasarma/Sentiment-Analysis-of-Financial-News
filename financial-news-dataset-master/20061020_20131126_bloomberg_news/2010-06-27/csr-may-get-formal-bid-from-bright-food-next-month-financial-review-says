             CSR Ltd. may receive a formal bid
from Bright Food Group Co. for its sugar unit before CSR’s
annual general meeting on July 8, the Australian Financial
Review reported, without saying where it got the information.
Analysts say CSR holders may benefit if the unit is spun off and
then sold, the newspaper said, without naming the analysts.
