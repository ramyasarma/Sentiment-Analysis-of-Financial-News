             Petr Necas  was named as the Czech
Republic’s new prime minister by President  Vaclav Klaus  to speed
up the creation of a new Cabinet a month after elections.  
 “I wish for you to succeed in forming a government as soon
as possible,’ Klaus said at the ceremony today at Prague Castle.  
 Necas is leader of the Civic Democrat Party, the biggest of
three parties that won a majority in May 28-29 elections. The
Civic Democrats, TOP09 and Public Affairs, have said they want
to have a Cabinet in place by mid-July so that they can shape
next year’s state  budget.   
 The three parties, which have 118 votes in the 200-seat
lower house, have pledged to restore fiscal prudence after the
budget deficit widened to 5.9 percent of gross domestic product
last year, almost double the European Union’s 3 percent limit.  
 “The new government needs to take an active part in
solving the budget for this year and the following years,”
Necas said after the ceremony.  
 The koruna traded at 25.705 per euro as of 11:17 a.m. in
Prague, versus 25.754 the previous trading day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 According to the constitution, the government must ask the
legislature for a confidence vote within 30 days of the Cabinet
being appointed.
