             Taiwan and China aim to sign three
agreements in a sixth round of cross-strait talks that will be
held later this year,  Chiang Pin-kung , chairman of the Taipei-
based Straits Exchange Foundation, said.  
 Taiwan and China will hold a fifth round of talks from
tomorrow to June 30 in Chongqing, China and plan another round
later in the year, Chiang said. An Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement, or ECFA, and an intellectual property
protection agreement will be signed on June 29, with the two
likely reaching further agreements on investment protection and
trade in goods and services in the sixth talks, he said.  
 “We will begin discussions on the three agreements within
six months after the ECFA is signed and approved by the
parliament,” said Chiang, who was speaking at a press briefing
today in Taipei.  
 Cross-strait negotiations resumed in 2008 after a nine-year
halt during which former Taiwan president  Lee Teng-hui  described
the talks as “state-to-state,” a term Beijing rejected. China
claims the self-ruled island as its territory and has threatened
force to impose Taiwan’s unification with the mainland.  
 An agreement to avoid double taxation isn’t included in the
fifth round of discussions, he added without elaboration.  
 Separately, Chiang said he will meet with Chongqing Mayor
 Bo Xilai  and Wang Yi, director of China’s Taiwan Affairs Office,
during his stay in Chongqing.
