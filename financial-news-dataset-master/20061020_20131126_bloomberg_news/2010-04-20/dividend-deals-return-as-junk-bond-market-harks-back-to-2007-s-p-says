             Companies with sub-investment grade
ratings may sell a record amount of bonds this year, S&P said in
a report. More of the borrowings may be used to pay shareholder
dividends “in a less welcome development” rather than for
refinancing shorter-term bank loans,  according to the report.
The trend is “reminiscent of the leveraged finance market back
in 2007,” S&P said.
