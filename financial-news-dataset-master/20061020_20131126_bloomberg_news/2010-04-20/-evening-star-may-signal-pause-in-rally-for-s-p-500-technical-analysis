             The yearlong rally in U.S. stocks
may pause after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index generated an
“evening star” pattern that signals a bearish trend, according
to Bank of America Corp.’s technical analyst Mary Ann Bartels.  
 The New York-based analyst used a Japanese charting
technique known as candlestick and found that the U.S. benchmark
formed the bearish reversal pattern toward the end of last week.  
 On April 14, the S&P 500 rose to the highest level since
September 2008 with the closing price 11.96 points above the
opening, the biggest gap since March 5. On the next day, the
index opened above the previous close, then fell and closed less
than 0.1 percent higher. The bearish trend continued into the
third day, when the S&P 500 opened below the previous close and
ended the day down 1.6 percent, the biggest loss since Feb. 4.  
 “There is a potential evening star top pattern,” Bartels,
ranked second among analysts who study price charts in
Institutional Investor magazine’s most recent survey, wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. “The uptrend line on the S&P 500
from the February low is under pressure.”  
 The index yesterday posted its biggest two-day decline in
more than two months after the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for fraud related to
collateralized debt obligations. It has gained 13 percent since
reaching its 2010 low on Feb. 8.  
 Bartels said she kept her long-term target for the S&P 500
at 1,325, provided the benchmark stays above 1,044.50, the
lowest intraday price so far this year. Indicators such as the
ratio of rising to falling stocks suggested the index’s 76
percent rally from its 12-year low in March 2009 may last, she
said.  
 The cumulative advance-decline line for securities listed
on the New York Stock Exchange increased to a record 91,569 on
April 14. The index represents the number of daily gains for
individual securities minus the number of declines since its
August 1996 inception.  
 “Any market weakness is more likely to represent pullbacks
or corrections within a larger uptrend,” Bartels said. “More
important tops tend to form when these indicators do not confirm
new highs in the market averages and set up negative
divergences.”
