             Ike Davis had two hits and
drove in a run in his Major League Baseball debut, leading
the New York Mets to a 6-1 victory against the Chicago
Cubs.  
 Davis, a first baseman who was the Mets’ first-round
draft pick in 2008, was promoted from the minor leagues
yesterday and singled in his first at-bat last night.  
 After flying out in his next two at-bats, Davis added
a run-scoring single during the Mets’ five-run seventh
inning at Citi Field in New York.  
 The 23-year-old Davis was called up after the Mets
lost eight of their first 12 games and ranked 24th among
the 30 major league teams with 48 runs scored. Davis was
hitting .364 with two homers and four runs batted in during
10 games for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons of the
International League.  
 “It’s been a long day and it’s been a dream come
true,” Davis told reporters after the game. “Now I just
have to work hard and try to make it last longer.”  
 Davis’s father, Ron, pitched for the New York Yankees,
Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers and San
Francisco Giants from 1978-1988.
