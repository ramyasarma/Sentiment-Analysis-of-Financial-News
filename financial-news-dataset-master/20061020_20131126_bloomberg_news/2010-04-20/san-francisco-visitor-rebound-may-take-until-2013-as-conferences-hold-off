             For convention planners, booking
hotels in San Francisco in the next year is a breeze. Getting
blocks of rooms three years from now may be harder.  
 Even as the economy recovers, the convention schedule won’t
get busy again until 2013, says Leonard Hoops, executive vice
president of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau,
which manages the Moscone Center, the city’s largest venue. The
2013 lineup includes a first-time cardiology conference that
will rival Oracle OpenWorld as the city’s top convention.  
 The recession took a toll on San Francisco hotels and
attractions last year, eating into business and generating 19
percent less tourism tax revenue than in 2008. The question now
is whether a recovery is years away -- or if an impromptu surge
of visitors will book rooms and restaurant tables before 2013.
Tourism supported almost 67,000 jobs in San Francisco last year,
with an annual payroll of $1.8 billion.  
 “It is a challenging time,” said Joe Barkett, chief
executive officer of the Cow Palace in nearby Daly City. The
indoor arena, which has hosted everything from Beatles concerts
to political conventions, opened in 1941. “We’ve had several
events that we were expecting that canceled,” he said.  
 Both the number of San Francisco visitors and the amount
they spent decreased last year. The city hosted 15.4 million
out-of-towners, a 5.8 percent drop from 2008. Those travelers
spent $7.8 billion, a 7.8 percent decline, according to the
visitors bureau.  
 Fewer Trips  
 Nationally, business travel dropped every year between 2004
and 2009, with the number of trips declining 16 percent over
that period to 432.6 million, according to the U.S. Travel
Association. The Washington-based organization expects that
number to rise 2.5 percent this year and 3.7 percent in 2011.  
 “The damage was so significant in 2009, that it will
likely take the industry years to recover,” said Geoff Freeman,
senior vice president of the association.  
 NetApp Inc., the Sunnyvale, California-based maker of
storage computers, canceled its user conference in 2009. The
company cited customer feedback about restrictions on corporate
travel. Cisco Systems Inc. scrapped a sales conference in San
Francisco scheduled for later in the year. The San Jose,
California-based company held the event online instead.  
 Entertainment events also took a hit. The Grand National
Rodeo, held annually at the Cow Palace, was canceled in 2009 --
though it’s scheduled to return this year.  
 Cannabis Show  
 Some cancelations have been replaced by new bookings, the
Cow Palace’s Barkett says. His venue also is drawing some
upstart conventions, such as the International Cannabis and Hemp
Expo. The two-day event, held last weekend, was the first of its
kind in the U.S., said Gaynell Rogers, a spokeswoman for the
show. It probably drew about 12,000 people, she says.
    “People are curious about a new emerging industry that is
creating jobs and challenging the traditional medical health
system,” Rogers said.  
 Fort Mason Center, a venue in San Francisco’s Marina
district, is expecting an “uptick” in bookings this year, says
Ann Lazarus, the organization’s executive director. The former
army base, which has 130,000 square feet (40,000 square meters)
of space, had a first-time event last week: Twitter Inc.’s
Chirp, a two-day conference for programmers.  
 “We found we were perhaps a little more resilient than
other venues,” Lazarus said. “Organizations that wanted to
hold events but didn’t want to appear as if they were going over
the top -- our military base atmosphere had a certain appeal to
them.”  
 Builders Conference  
 The Moscone Center, a sprawling complex with more than 2
million square feet, is coping with smaller crowds. PCBC,
formerly known as the Pacific Coast Builders Conference, drew
about 13,000 attendees last June -- down from almost 20,000 in
2008, according to its Web site. The number of exhibitors
plunged to 350 from 600, allowing the entire conference to fit
in one of Moscone’s three halls.  
 Oracle OpenWorld, held in September, is currently Moscone’s
largest conference. Visitors typically book 70,000 hotel-room
nights, Hoops says.  
 The venue will get a similarly sized event in 2013, when
the American College of Cardiology holds its annual session in
San Francisco for the first time. The group expects 25,000
attendees to reserve 77,000 hotel-room nights, Hoops says.  
 In total, conventions should book between 850,000 and
900,000 room nights in 2013, the first year since 2008 that the
numbers will be that high, he says.  
 “I wish I could say the same for 2010, 2011 and 2012,”
Hoops said. They’re “all tracking to be below-average years.”
