             UralChem Holding Plc, the Russian
fertilizer producer seeking as much as $642 million in an
initial public offering, is delaying meetings with investors in
London because of disruption to European air travel, three
people familiar with the situation said.  
 UralChem was scheduled to meet investors tomorrow and has
postponed the start of the London roadshow to the end of this
week at the earliest, according to the people, who declined to
be identified because the information isn’t public. Moscow-based
UralChem “confirms that that schedule has been modified,” it
said today in an e-mail.  
 The flight ban introduced after the Eyjafjallajökull
volcano in Iceland erupted on April 14 has led to the
cancellation of 81,000 flights across Europe.  
 At least six non U.K.-based companies had been scheduled to
gauge investor interest in London this week. Officials from
Avangardco Investments Public Ltd. are driving to London from
Vienna and expect to meet investors on time, according to two
people involved in the Ukrainian egg producer’s plan to raise as
much as $256 million in an IPO.  
 Essar Energy, part of Mumbai-based Essar Group, is seeking
to raise about $2.5 billion in London’s biggest IPO since 2006.
It started meeting investors yesterday, two people familiar with
the matter said.
