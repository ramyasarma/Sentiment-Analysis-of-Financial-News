             A group of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. creditors asked a bankruptcy judge for permission to seek
information from auditor Ernst & Young LLP about transactions
the investment bank is accused of using to hide debt.  
 The committee of unsecured creditors said in a filing
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York that it wants
information from Lehman’s former auditor about the transactions
to determine, for example, whether the group could sue parties
who profited from Lehman’s use of the deals.  
 A report by Lehman’s bankruptcy examiner last month found
that former Chief Executive Officer Richard Fuld was “at least
grossly negligent” for letting Lehman file financial reports in
which a key gauge of strength was “reverse-engineered” through
transactions known as Repo 105s and that Ernst & Young could be
accused of “professional malpractice.”  
 Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008. The Wall Street investment bank’s failure helped
trigger a freeze of global credit markets, forcing the U.S.
government to provide $700 billion in bailout funds.  
 Charles Perkins, a spokesman for Ernst & Young in New York,
declined to comment.  
 The accounting firm said last month that it last audited
Lehman for the year ended Nov. 30, 2007, and that Lehman’s
financial statements for that year were presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  
 The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).
