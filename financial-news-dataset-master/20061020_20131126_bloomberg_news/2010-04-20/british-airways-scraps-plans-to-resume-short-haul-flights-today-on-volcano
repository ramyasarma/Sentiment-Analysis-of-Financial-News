             British Airways Plc scrapped plans
to resume short-haul flights today after a volcanic eruption in
Iceland strengthened, sending a new ash cloud toward the U.K.  
 The carrier still intends to fly long-haul services from 4
p.m. “subject to the full and permanent opening of airspace,”
it said in a statement on its Web site. Scheduled short-haul
flights had been due to resume at 7 p.m.  
 A new ash cloud is spreading south and east from the
Eyjafjallajökull volcano toward the U.K., according to National
Air Traffic Services, the country’s flight-control authority.
Flight bans across Northern Europe since the volcano erupted on
April 14 have led to the cancellation of 81,000 flights and are
costing carriers as much as $300 million a day in lost revenue,
according to the International Air Transport Association.  
 NATS said at 2:45 a.m. that Scottish airports should be
open from 7 a.m. and that some airspace over northern England
would likely be available for flights from 1 p.m. London
airspace was expected to remain closed, it said in a statement
on its Web site.
