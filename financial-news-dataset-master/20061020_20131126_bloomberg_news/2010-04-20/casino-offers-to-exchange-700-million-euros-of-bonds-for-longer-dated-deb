             Smiths Group Plc is raising 300
million euros ($400 million) from its first sale of bonds in the
currency as the world’s biggest maker of security scanners for
airports seeks to extend the maturity of its existing debt.  
 The seven-year notes will be priced to yield 135 basis
points more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction. That compares with 123 basis
points on average for companies with ratings similar to the
London-based company’s BBB+ grade, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 “Smiths’s new bond offers some pick up in comparison to
deals from similar companies, which should help to entice
investor demand,” said Maureen Schuller, a credit strategist at
ING Groep NV in Amsterdam.  
 Demand for corporate assets has helped shrink BBB rated
debt yields to near the lowest in more than two years, down from
a peak of 420 basis points in January 2009, Merrill Lynch data
show. The drop in yields has helped spur a surge in sales by
first-time issuers to more than 9 billion euros this year, the
most since at least 2006, Societe Generale SA data show.  
 Smiths will use the proceeds from the issue to help
refinance 150 million pounds ($230 million) of 7.875 percent
bonds due this year, said spokesman Colin McSeveny in London.
The notes will also extend the company’s debt profile, he said.  
 Smiths has sold debt in dollars and pounds, most recently
issuing $250 million of five-year notes in May, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “Smiths is a fairly well-known name with a good reputation
within the technology sector,” said Simon Ballard, a senior
credit strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London. “These
types of credits should offer investors relative performance and
capital preservation.”  
 The pipeline of this year’s debut bond issuers is growing.
Groupe SEB, the French kitchen appliance maker, plans to sell
bonds for the first time in euros, said a banker involved in the
transaction, who declined to be identified before a sale is
completed. The Ecully, France-based company will meet with
investors starting May 3 in Paris.
