             Amazon.com Inc. asked a federal
court to block a request by North Carolina for customer data,
including personal information about residents and what they
bought from the online retailer.  
 The North Carolina Department of Revenue’s request, which
is part of an audit of Amazon’s compliance with state sales and
use tax laws, would violate the First Amendment rights of its
customers, Amazon said in a complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Seattle.  
 Amazon said it already provided North Carolina with
information about what it has sold to state residents and what
they paid. North Carolina has threatened contempt proceedings if
Amazon doesn’t turn over the names and addresses of each
customer in the state who bought something from Amazon,
according to the complaint.  
 A call to the public affairs office at the North Carolina
Department of Revenue wasn’t answered after business hours
yesterday.  
 The case is Amazon.com v. Kenneth R. Lay, 10-00664, U.S.
District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle).
