             Tesco Plc, Britain’s biggest
retailer, fell as much as 2.4 percent in London trading as
analysts said international earnings missed estimates.  
 “Tesco have had a slight miss on each of the international
profit divisions,” which includes Europe, Asia and the U.S.,
Christopher Hogbin, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said by
telephone. “The balance sheet was very positive, with debt down
and the outlook pretty upbeat.”  
 The grocer said its U.S. Fresh & Easy chain made a 165
million-pound ($253 million) loss as “prolonged weakness” in
California, Nevada and Arizona hurt sales. Tesco plans to
increase the pace of overseas store openings this year to fuel
long-term growth.  
 Net income climbed to 2.33 billion pounds in the year ended
Feb. 27 from 2.13 billion pounds a year earlier, meeting
analysts’ estimates.  
 Tesco shares fell as much as 10.45 pence to 427 pence in
early London trading, and were down 2.85 pence, or 0.7 percent,
to 434.6 pence as of 8:48 a.m. local time. The stock has climbed
1.6 percent this year, compared with J Sainsbury Plc’s 6.1
percent increase and Carrefour SA’s 13 percent gain.
