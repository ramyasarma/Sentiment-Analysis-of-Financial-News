             Fourteen makers of generic drugs,
including  Teva Pharamecutical Industries (TEVA)  Ltd. and  Mylan
Laboratories (MYL)  Inc.,  won U.S. approval to copy  Novartis (NOVN)  AG's
Lamisil tablets, a nail-fungus treatment, setting the stage for
lower prices.  
 The Food and Drug Administration cleared the first generic
versions of prescription-strength Lamisil after the patent on the
medicine expired on June 30, the agency said today in a
statement. U.S. sales of the drug were $574 million last year, or
1.6 percent of Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis's sales from
continuing operations, according to the company's annual report.  
 Generic-drug makers can apply to the FDA to market copies of
brand-name medicines if their patents have expired or have been
declared invalid. Increased competition usually causes prices to
fall 30 percent to 80 percent, according to the Generic
Pharmaceutical Association, a trade group in Arlington, Virginia.
A 30-day supply of Lamisil tablets now costs $392.16 from the
Internet retailer Drugstore.com.  
 Separately, the FDA said it also approved the first generic
version of over-the-counter Lamisil cream for athlete's foot. The
copy is made by  Taro Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (TARO)
