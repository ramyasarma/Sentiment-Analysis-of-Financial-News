             Five Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
executives sold stock worth $65.4 million after the company 
received notice of possible fraud charges from the government, 
the Wall Street Journal reported.   
 Goldman received a notice from the Securities & Exchange 
Commission in July and disclosed it only later, saying it 
didn’t consider such a notice as material information for 
investors, the Journal said. The stock fell 13 percent on April
16 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed 
civil fraud charges against Goldman in a case involving the 
sale of collateralized debt obligations.  
 It isn’t clear if the sales would draw scrutiny under 
insider-trading laws, the Journal said. An unidentified Goldman
spokesman declined to comment and said the executives weren’t 
available to comment, according to the Journal.  
 Board member John Bryan, Co-General Counsel Esta Stecher, 
Principal Accounting Officer Sarah Smith, and Vice Chairmen 
Michael Evans and Michael Sherwood sold stock between October 
2009 and February 2010, the newspaper said. That was the most 
active period of insider selling in three years at Goldman, the
Journal said, citing InsiderScore.com.  
 Smith declined to comment and the others weren’t reachable 
at their offices, the Journal said.
