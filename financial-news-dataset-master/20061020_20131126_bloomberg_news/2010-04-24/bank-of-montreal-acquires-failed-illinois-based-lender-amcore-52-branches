             Bank of Montreal, Canada’s fourth-
biggest lender, purchased Rockford, Illinois-based Amcore Bank
from regulators in a bid to expand in the Illinois and Wisconsin
markets.  
 Bank of Montreal paid a 0.01 percent premium to acquire
$3.4 billion in deposits at Amcore, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said today in a statement on its Web site.
Amcore’s 52 branches will become offices of Harris Bank, owned
by Bank of Montreal, the Toronto-based lender said today in a
statement.  
 “This is a perfect strategic fit that accelerates our
growth strategy and reinforces our already strong position in
the U.S. Midwest,” Bank of Montreal Chief Executive Officer
William Downe said in the statement.  
 Downe, 58, has said he’s been looking to expand Chicago-
based Harris Bank by increasing business lending, growing from
within and making “small and medium-sized” takeovers if they
make sense. Bank of Montreal expanded in the U.S. with its C$718
million ($716 million) takeover of Harris Bank in 1984.  
 The bank has spent about C$2.5 billion on buying U.S. banks
since the Harris purchase, including C$315 million two years ago
for two Wisconsin lenders.
