             Chilean  interest-rate swaps  surged
after a report showed the economy grew at the fastest pace in
almost five years, surprising all nine analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  
 The three-month interest-rate swap rate rose 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 1.8 percent, the highest
intraday level since June 11 while the six-month rate jumped 12
basis points to 2.34 percent as traders priced in a faster
trajectory for central bank rate increases.  
 Chile’s  economic activity  expanded 7.1 percent in May from
a year earlier, the fastest since June 2005, adding to
speculation the central bank will raise its  benchmark rate  for
the second straight month on July 15. The median forecast of six
economists in a  Bloomberg survey  is that the bank will once
again increase the rate by half a percentage point.  
 “This was a pretty surprising figure,” said  Jorge Selaive , chief economist at Banco de Credito e Inversiones in
Santiago. “As long as consumer price inflation is between 0.1
and 0.2 percent, as expected, this 7.1 percent increase in
activity guarantees a half point rate rise next week.”  
 Consumer prices rose 0.18 percent in June from May,
according to Banco Santander SA prices for inflation. The median
forecast of 11 economists in a  Bloomberg survey  is that the
National Statistics Institute will announce on July 8 that
prices rose 0.2 percent.  
 Peso Weakens  
 The peso weakened 0.4 percent to 539.08 per U.S. dollar,
from 537.15 on July 2, as a retreat in global stocks and the
euro offset the faster-than-expected economic growth. The
currency earlier strengthened to 534.38 per dollar.  
 “The dollar opened down against the peso on the very high
activity reading, which obviously increased expectations of
further rate rises -- probably 50 basis points at the next
meeting,” said  Cristobal Doberti , an economist at Bice
Inversiones in Santiago. “It then reverted on the weakness in
stocks.”  
 The euro dropped 0.2 percent on speculation the European
central bank will keep its rate at a record low.
