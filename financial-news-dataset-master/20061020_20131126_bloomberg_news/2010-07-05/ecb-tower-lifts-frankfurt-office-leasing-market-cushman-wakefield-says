             The construction of the European
Central Bank’s new headquarters will help Frankfurt’s office
leasing market show a “slight” improvement this year,  Cushman
& Wakefield Inc . said.  
 New leases totaled 230,000 square meters (2.5 million
square feet) in the first half, the New York-based property
broker said in a report today. That included the 104,000 square
meters that the ECB will occupy at its new home in the German
city’s Ostend district when the building is completed.  
 “Overall, we expect a moderate upturn in the market in the
second half of the year and an annual result that is a slight
improvement on 2009,” Inga Schwarz, head of research at Cushman
& Wakefield in Germany, said in the statement.  
 Developers are constructing offices in Frankfurt to replace
older buildings. The city, which houses the headquarters of
Deutsche Bank AG, Germany’s largest lender, has a vacancy rate
of 15 percent with 1.75 million square meters of space available
for short-term leases, the broker estimates.  
 The ECB is currently based in a building close to
Frankfurt’s main railway station. Cushman & Wakefield is the
world’s largest closely held real-estate broker.
