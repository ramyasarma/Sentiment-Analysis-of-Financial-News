             Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd., a unit of
Coal India Ltd., shut eleven mines at Talcher in Orissa because
of a nationwide strike by political parties protesting an
increase in fuel prices.  
 Protesters belonging to the state’s ruling Biju Janata Dal
and the main federal opposition Bharatiya Janata Party prevented
workers from getting into the mines, Amalesh Kumar, a general
manager at Mahanadi Coalfields, said in a phone interview from
Talcher.  
 Mines in Talcher produce 150,000 metric tons of coal a day
and sell 120,000 tons to users including NTPC Ltd., India’s
biggest power producer, and National Aluminium Co., the nation’s
second-biggest producer of the metal.
