             George Weah , a former world soccer
player of the year, said he will run for the Liberian presidency
next year, after failing to win the post in 2005.  
 The former A.C. Milan striker will compete against
President  Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf  in an October 2011 election in
the West African nation of 3.7 million people, after losing to
her in the country’s first ballot after a 14-year civil war.  
 “You can say that I will run again,” he told reporters in
Johannesburg today. “I think I have the confidence of my
people.”  
 The World Bank and International Monetary Fund last month
said they would cancel $4.6 billion of Liberia’s foreign debt, a
move that will enable it to spend revenue on rebuilding an
economy ruined by the civil war that ended in 2003.  
 Johnson-Sirleaf defeated Weah with almost 20 percent more
of the vote in a 2005 run-off.  
 Weah was brought up in a poor part of the capital Monrovia
and dropped out of secondary school before making his fortune in
Europe and winning the player of the year award in 1995.
