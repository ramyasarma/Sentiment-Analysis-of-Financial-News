             Qatar shares advanced, ending a six-
day drop and leading Gulf markets higher, as Asian stocks
increased and crude oil gained. Industries Qatar climbed the
most in almost a month.  
 The  QE Index  rose 0.9 percent, the most since June 21, to
6,824.7.  Industries Qatar,  the second-biggest petrochemicals
maker in the Middle East, gained 1.2 percent and  Qatar National
Bank SAQ  added 1.9 percent before releasing earnings tomorrow.
The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  advanced 0.7 percent and Dubai’s
 index  increased 0.3 percent, paring the 2010 drop to 18 percent.  
 Emerging-market stocks advanced for a second day, led by
technology companies, on speculation consumer spending will
withstand a slowing global economic recovery. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index climbed 0.2 percent. Asian stocks rose, following
the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s  biggest weekly drop in more than a
month, amid takeover news in Australia and as a weaker yen
boosted the outlook for Japan’s exporters.  
 “The simple fact that we woke up today and Asia was stable
instead of down has some people feeling a little better,” said
 Akram Annous , deputy fund manager at Al Mal Capital PSC in
Dubai. “Volumes continue to trend lower and that is obviously a
clear reflection of investor interests.”  
 Volumes  
 IFA Securities LLC, a Dubai-based brokerage established by
Kuwait’s International Financial Advisors KSCC, closed after
stock markets tumbled and volumes slumped. About 43 million
shares traded in Dubai today, compared with a six-month daily
average of 190 million. Eleven brokerages in the United Arab
Emirates have either shut down this year or are in the process
of closing, The National newspaper reported in June, citing the
market regulator.  
 Crude oil gained as much as 56 cents to $72.70 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
investors bet the commodity’s biggest weekly drop since May made
it cheap given the outlook for global growth. The six nations of
the Gulf Cooperation Council supply about a fifth of the world’s
oil.  
 Industries Qatar advanced the most since June 10 to 96.1
riyals. Qatar National Bank, the Persian Gulf country’s biggest
lender by assets, rose to 134.2 riyals. Five analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg estimate that the company’s second-quarter earnings
will increase 25 percent to 1.32 billion riyals ($363 million).  
 Drake & Scull International PJSC  advanced 2.3 percent after
the Dubai-based developer confirmed it was awarded a $120
million contract from Damac Properties in Saudi Arabia.  
 Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  rose 0.5 percent to
6,030.32. Food processing company  Halwani Bros Co.  surged 9.8
percent, the most since June 2009, to 41.5 riyals after it said
second-quarter profit increased 82 percent to 21.7 million
riyals ($5.8 million).  
 Abu Dhabi’s  benchmark index  increased 0.2 percent and
Oman’s  MSM30 Index  added 0.4 percent. Bahrain’s  gauge  and the 
Kuwait Stock Exchange Index  were little changed. In North
Africa, Egypt’s  EGX 30 Index  dropped for a ninth day, losing 0.8
percent to 5,850.38, the lowest in almost a year.
