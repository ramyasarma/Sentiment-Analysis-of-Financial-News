             China bought a net 541 billion yen of
Japan government bonds in the first four months of this year,
Nikkei English News said, without citing anyone. That’s more
than double the total for all of 2005, which was the previous
full-year record, the report said.  
 The increase coincides with Europe’s fiscal crisis, the
report said.
