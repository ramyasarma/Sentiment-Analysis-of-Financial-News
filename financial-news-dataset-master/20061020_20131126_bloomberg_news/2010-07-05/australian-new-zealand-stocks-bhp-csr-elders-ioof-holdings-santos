 The following were among the most active shares in the
market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company
names.  
 Australia:  
      Centennial Coal Co. Ltd.  (CEY AU) jumped 32 percent to
A$5.83. Banpu Pcl, Thailand’s biggest coal producer, agreed to
pay A$2 billion ($1.7 billion) for the rest of Centennial as
demand climbs in China.  
       CSR Ltd.  (CSR AU) surged 3.5 percent to A$1.76. Wilmar
International Ltd., the world’s largest palm-oil trader, agreed
to buy CSR’s Sucrogen sugar unit for A$1.75 billion, countering
an offer from China’s Bright Food Group Co.  
 Elders Ltd.  (ELD AU) jumped 11 percent to 42 Australian
cents. The world’s largest wool broker said growing conditions
across Australia are “robust” and the company’s horticulture
unit is doing well.  
 Santos Ltd.  (STO AU), Australia’s third-largest oil and gas
producer, climbed 1.5 percent to A$12.40. Santos may consider
selling some of its offshore Western Australian assets for as
much as A$1 billion, the Australian Financial Review reported in
its Street Talk column, without saying where it got the
information.  
 Sigma Phamaceuticals Ltd. (SIP AU) fell 2.5 percent to 39.5
Australian cents. The company, the subject of a A$707 million
takeover offer from Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd., dropped on
speculation the deal won’t succeed.  
 “Expectations of Aspen formalizing a bid at A$0.60 are
low,”  David Arter , a health-care analyst at Wilson HTM
Investment Group in Brisbane, said in an e-mail.  
      Whitehaven Coal Ltd.  (WHC AU) climbed 5.1 percent to A$4.75.
The company was rated “buy” in new coverage at Mainfirst
Securities Hong Kong Ltd. by equity analyst  William Stephens .  
 New Zealand:  
      NZX Ltd.  (NZX NZ) rose 6.9 percent to NZ$1.56. The operator
of New Zealand’s stock exchange said it will buy back as many as
3.57 million shares because the current stock price doesn’t
reflect a reasonable valuation of the company.
