             Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s
ruling party may retain all its seats in next week’s election
for the  upper house  of parliament even as his popularity drops
over a proposal to raise the nation’s sales tax, polls show.  
 The  Democratic Party of Japan  will likely achieve its
target of winning at least 54 seats in the July 11 contest, the
Mainichi newspaper said today. It remains to be seen whether the
DPJ and its coalition partner will achieve the 56-seat threshold
needed to maintain its outright majority in the chamber, the
newspaper said, citing a poll taken July 2-4.  
 The administration needs to keep its majority to ensure
passage of legislation as its aims to boost growth and reduce
the world’s largest public  debt . Kan has said he is willing to
consider raising the 5 percent sales tax to improve the nation’s
finances and boost social welfare funding for the country’s
aging population.  
 A separate poll today showed voters have increasing doubts
about the premier, who took office a month ago after replacing
 Yukio Hatoyama . Kan’s approval rating fell to 39 percent from 48
percent a week ago, the Asahi newspaper said in a poll published
today. The DPJ’s support dropped 7 percentage points to 30
points, while that of the main opposition  Liberal Democratic
Party , rose 1 point to 15 percent.  
 The LDP governed almost uninterrupted for more than 50
years until the Democrats won a landslide in the more powerful
lower house last August.  
 The Asahi surveyed 1,078 people July 3-4. The Mainichi
surveyed 40,373 people. Neither newspaper gave a margin of error.  
 The Mainichi said the ruling party is likely to win between
49 and 59 of the 121 seats up for grabs in the 242-seat upper
house. Coalition partner the  People’s New Party  may not win any,
and no more than 1 seat, the newspaper said. The LDP will
probably gain between 39 and 48 seats, while the newly formed
Your Party, composed mostly former LDP members, will win between
8 and 13 seats, the newspaper said.  
 The Asahi survey said 48 percent of voters oppose raising
the sales tax, while 39 percent are in favor.
