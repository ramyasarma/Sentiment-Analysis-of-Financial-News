             Russian stocks climbed for a second
day as copper prices advanced, boosting the earnings outlook for
producers.
      OAO GMKN Norilsk Nickel,  Russia’s largest mining company,
added 2.5 percent, while oil producer  OAO Gazprom Neft  increased
1.1 percent. The  Micex Index  of 30 stocks gained 0.3 percent to
1,292.19 by the close in Moscow. The ruble weakened 0.2 percent
versus the dollar to 31.1550, while the government’s benchmark
dollar bonds due April 2020 rose, sending the yield 2 basis
points lower to 5.48 percent.  
 Emerging-market stocks rose for a second day as higher
metals and a rally in technology shares outweighed concern the
global economic expansion is slowing. Copper for delivery in
three months climbed $68, or 1.1 percent, to $6,478 a metric ton
on the London Metals Exchange.  
 Crude, Russia’s main export, rose as much as 0.8 percent to
$72.70 per barrel, after its biggest weekly decline in two
months made the commodity appear attractively priced to
investors. Oil retreated to $71.64 at the Micex’s close.  
 “The market is inching higher supported by crude futures
and stronger metals,”  John Heisel , a sales trader at Citigroup
Inc. in Moscow, said by telephone.  
 Increasing Bets  
 Investors increased bets that the ruble will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
31.3505 per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of
31.2725 on July 2. The contracts are a guide to expectations of
currency movements as they allow foreign investors and companies
to fix the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The ruble strengthened 0.3 percent versus the euro to
39.0450. Those movements left it little changed at 34.7055
against the central bank’s  target  currency basket, which is used
to manage swings that hurt Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
