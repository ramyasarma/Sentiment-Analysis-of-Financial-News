             Japan’s  stocks  rose, led by consumer
lenders after the Mainichi newspaper reported that Osaka
Prefecture may loosen loan restrictions, while a weaker yen
against the euro boosted exporters.  
 Acom Co., a consumer-finance company, soared 25 percent.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Acom’s parent company,
climbed 1.5 percent.  Elpida Memory Inc. , which receives about 27
percent of revenue from Europe, rose 3.2 percent. Canon Inc.,
the world’s largest maker of cameras, increased 1.1 percent.  
 “The prospect of looser lending restrictions in Osaka is
stoking expectations that consumer lenders will once again start
to expand,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee about $6
billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “The yen is
taking a breather from its strengthening, and people are buying
exporters.”  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  climbed 0.5 percent to
9,252.63 as of 12:37 p.m. in Tokyo. The broader Topix index
gained 0.8 percent to 837.20, with more than twice as many
stocks advancing as falling.  
 The  Nikkei 225  dropped 5.5 percent last week as weaker
manufacturing growth in the U.S., Europe and China added to
signs the global economic recovery is faltering. Companies in
the gauge trade at 17.2 times estimated earnings, the lowest
level since December 2008.  
 Acom soared 25 percent to 1,431 yen.  Mitsubishi UFJ ,
Japan’s largest bank by market value, rose 1.5 percent to 408
yen and was the biggest contributor to the Topix index’s advance.
Credit Saison Co., a consumer-credit company, jumped 8.7 percent
to 995 yen.  
 Bigger Loans  
 Osaka’s prefectural government is working on a plan to
loosen restrictions for consumer lending in its region, the
Mainichi newspaper reported on July 4, without citing anyone.  
 The policy may allow higher interest rates for funds to
small-to-medium sized businesses and a larger limit on lending
to individuals who have the means to pay back unsecured loans,
the report said.  
 The Osaka prefectural government plans to announce the plan
tomorrow, Yumi Fujiwara, a spokeswoman for Osaka, said without
giving additional details. Motoyuki Yufu, a spokesman at Japan’s
Financial Services Agency declined to comment on the report.  
 Elpida  increased 3.2 percent to 1,331 yen. The computer-
memory chip maker may start manufacturing ultra-small dynamic
random access memory chips with three Taiwanese companies this
month, Nikkei English News reported.  
 Canon, which counts Europe as it biggest overseas market,
increased 1.1 percent to 3,295 yen.  Sharp Corp. , which gets more
than half of its sales abroad, gained 2.9 percent to 945 yen.  
 Weaker Yen  
 Sony Corp. , which receives about 21 percent of its sales
from Europe, advanced 1.4 percent to 2,343 yen. Credit Suisse
Group AG rated the electronics maker “outperform” in new
coverage.  
 The yen fell to as much as 110.32 against the euro from
109.93 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo on July 2. A
weaker yen boosts companies’ revenue from overseas sales when
converted into the local currency.  
 Among stocks that fell,  Fast Retailing Co.  dropped 3.7
percent to 12,940 yen, posting the biggest decline on the Nikkei
225. Domestic sales at its Uniqlo stores fell 5.8 percent last
month and Nomura Holdings Inc. cut the clothing retailer’s
rating to “neutral” from “buy.”

     Sentiment among Japan’s largest manufacturers rose to a two-year high, signaling Europe’s debt crisis has yet to undermine their confidence in the global recovery. The quarterly Tankan index of sentiment at large manufacturers climbed 15 points in June to plus 1, the Bank of Japan said in Tokyo today. (Source: Bloomberg)
