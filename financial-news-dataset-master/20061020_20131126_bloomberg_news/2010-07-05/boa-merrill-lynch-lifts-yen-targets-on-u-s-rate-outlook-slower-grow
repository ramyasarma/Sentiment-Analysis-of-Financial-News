             Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch
unit raised its forecasts for the yen versus the dollar and euro,
citing lower projections for U.S. interest rates and a retreat
in risk appetite amid global growth concerns.  
 The bank now expects the Japanese currency to finish 2010
at 90 against the dollar from a previous forecast of 97. The yen
will trade at 104 per euro by year-end from 112 in its previous
estimate, Merrill Lynch said in a research note today.  
 U.S. payrolls fell in June for the first time this year as
the government cut temporary workers, a Labor Department report
showed on July 2. The New York-based brokerage said the Federal
Reserve will likely raise rates in March 2012, compared with its
earlier projection of August 2011.  
 “We think concerns about slower global growth are likely
to constrain risk appetite for the time being, with a likelihood
of temporary yen gains on risk aversion,” Merrill Lynch
strategists led by Tokyo-based  Tomoko Fujii  wrote in the report.  
 The Japanese currency has appreciated this year against all
16 major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg as the Greece-
triggered debt crisis stoked speculation some European nations
will struggle to curb budget deficits. The yen has strengthened
17 percent versus the euro this year.  
 The yen typically appreciates in times of financial turmoil
as the nation’s trade surplus means the nation doesn’t have to
rely on overseas lenders.  
 Merrill Lynch raised its yen forecasts for the third
quarter, expecting it to trade at 89 to the dollar from 94
previously, and 107 per euro from 113. Japan’s currency will end
2011 at 97 against the greenback from 106, and at 107 to the
euro from 117, it said.
