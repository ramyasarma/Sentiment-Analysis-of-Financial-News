             Toronto restaurants were among the
city’s businesses most hurt by the Group of 20 summit, with a
decline in sales of as much as 67 percent in some areas, said
Canada’s largest debit and credit-card processor.  
 Spending fell at Toronto stores, restaurants, tourist spots
and entertainment venues from June 25 to June 27, when world
leaders along with thousands of police and protesters occupied
Canada’s largest city for the G-20 gathering, according to
Moneris Solutions Corp.  
 Retail sales inside the G-20 security zone, which
segregated 12 blocks of Toronto’s financial core, fell by 28
percent based on dollar value and 41 percent by number of
transactions compared with the previous weekend, Moneris said in
a statement today. Restaurants in the fenced-off zone had a 67
percent drop in sales and a 56 percent decline in transactions.  
 Store sales in the downtown area outside the security zone
fell 11 percent while debit and credit-card transactions dropped
16 percent, Moneris said. Downtown eateries recorded a 33
percent drop in sales and 25 percent decline in transactions.  
 Retail sales outside downtown were also hurt, with sales
falling 9.3 percent on a 15 percent drop in transactions, said
Toronto-based Moneris, which is owned by  Royal Bank of Canada 
and  Bank of Montreal .  
 Financial firms in the downtown area encouraged employees
to work from home or take time off, while some shops and
restaurants shut to avoid the protests and road closures linked
to the summit.
