             China Minsheng Banking Corp. was
raised to “buy” from “sell” by Citigroup Inc. analyst Simon
Ho, who said faster-than-expected growth in the company’s
higher-margin small business lending operations will drive
“positive earnings surprises.”  
 Ho raised his share-price estimate to HK$8.70 from HK$6.58.
