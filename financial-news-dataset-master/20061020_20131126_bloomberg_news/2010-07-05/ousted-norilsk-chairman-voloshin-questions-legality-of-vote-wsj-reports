             Alexander Voloshin, a former chief of
staff to Rusian Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin, 
questioned the validity of the vote which overthrew him as 
chairman of OAO Norilsk Nickel, the Wall Street Journal 
reported, citing a letter he wrote.  
 Voloshin refused to sign off on the board meeting that 
overthrew him, citing what he said were violations of corporate
best practice, Russian law and the charter that governed the 
way the meeting was run, the newspaper said.  
 Voloshin gave his support to UC RUSAL, the aluminum company
controlled by Oleg Deripaska, which owns 25 percent of Norilsk 
and is fighting Interros Holding for dominance of the company, 
the WSJ said.
