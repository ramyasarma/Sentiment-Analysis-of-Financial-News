             Abengoa SA  surged the most in 20
months in Madrid trading after the company won a $1.45 billion
loan guarantee from the U.S. government to build a solar-power
plant in Arizona.  
 The shares climbed as much as 15 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Oct. 13, 2008, and traded at 18.70 euros, up
13 percent, as of 9:30 a.m. local time.  
 The plant, to be built 70 miles (113 kilometers) southwest
of Phoenix, will be the world’s largest solar-power
installation, producing 250 megawatts and serving 70,000
families, the Seville-based company on July 3 in a statement.  
 The Solana installation, using solar-thermal technology,
will prevent 475,000 tons in carbon-dioxide emissions annually,
according to the company’s calculations.  
 Seville, Spain-based Abengoa plans to start construction
before year-end and begin generating electricity before the end
of 2013,  Santiago Seage , chief executive officer of the
company’s solar unit, said in a July 3 interview.
