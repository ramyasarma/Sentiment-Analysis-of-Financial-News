             IFA Securities LLC,  a Dubai-based
brokerage established by Kuwait’s  International Financial
Advisors KSCC , closed after stock markets tumbled and volumes
slumped.  
 “The costs of operations were too high considering the
current state of the market” and low trading volumes, said Emad
Eldin Abbas, operations manager at IFA. The company plans to
reopen in a year, after having combined with another brokerage,
Abbas said. IFA has 13 employees.  
 Dubai’s benchmark stocks index has plunged more than 80
