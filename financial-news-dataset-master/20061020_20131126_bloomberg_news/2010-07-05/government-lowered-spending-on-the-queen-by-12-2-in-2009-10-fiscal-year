             The U.K. cut its spending on Queen
Elizabeth II by 3.3 million pounds to 38.2 million pounds in
2009-10, a reduction of 12.2 percent from a year earlier, the
monarch’s household said, presenting the annual publication of
the royal finances.  
 The cut is due mainly to a reduction in commercial charter
flights used by the head of state and a refund of lease rentals
arising from the sale of the queen’s helicopter, which was
replaced last year, Buckingham Palace said in an e-mail today.  
 “The Treasury contributed the equivalent of just 62 pence
per person in the country to enable the queen to carry out her
duties as head of state,’’ Alan Reid, the keeper of the privy
purse, said in the e-mail.  
 “The royal household is acutely aware of the difficult
economic climate and took early action to reduce its civil list
expenditure by 2.5 per cent in real terms in 2009,’’ Reid said.
“We are implementing a headcount freeze and reviewing every
vacancy to see if we can avoid replacement.”
