             Hong Kong stocks  fell for a fourth
day, completing the benchmark index’s longest losing streak in
two months, on concern over an economic slowdown and as lenders
slid after Bank of China Ltd. announced plans for a rights offer.
       Bank of China  dropped 1.3 percent after trading resumed
following an announcement that the nation’s third-largest lender
by market value plans to raise as much as 60 billion yuan ($8.9
billion) to replenish capital. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the
country’s No. 1 producer of the metal, lost 2.1 percent. China
Cosco Holdings Co., the nation’s largest shipping company by
market value, sank 4.1 percent along with commodity-shipping
rates.  
 “Poor market sentiment adds to the fear in the market,”
said  Steven Leung , director of institutional sales at UOB-Kay
Hian Ltd. “Investors are wary that China’s economic growth
might be slowing, leading to the drop in banks’ shares.”  
 The  Hang Seng Index  retreated 0.3 percent to close at
19,842.20, extending its drop in the past four days to 4.3
percent. That’s the gauge’s longest losing streak since the five
days ended May 7. More than two stocks fell among the Hang Seng
Composite Index’s 307 constituents for each that rose.  
 The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H-shares
of Chinese companies slipped 0.6 percent to 11,184.33. The
measure has tumbled 7.8 percent in the past nine days, its
longest losing streak since April 1996.  
 The Hang Seng Index has dropped 9.3 percent this year as
worries about budget deficits in Europe and tighter monetary
policy in China dented confidence in the strength of the global
economy.  
 Shares on the benchmark index are priced at an average  13.1
times  estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov. 16, when
the index hit its high for 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Banks’ Fundraising  
      Bank of China  slid 1.3 percent to HK$3.92. The lender will
sell as many as 19.56 billion shares in Shanghai and 8.36
billion in Hong Kong, it said July 2. Trading resumed after a
one-day suspension.  
 The rights offer adds to as much as $45.6 billion in
fundraising announced by China’s five biggest state-controlled
banks.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s largest
lender by customers, is in the midst of a $20.1 billion initial
public offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong.  
 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world’s
biggest lender by market value, fell 0.7 percent to HK$5.58.
China Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s No. 2 bank by market
value, slid 1 percent to HK$6.14.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc dropped 0.8 percent to HK$71.15 after the
chairman of Europe’s biggest bank said financial markets remain
“fragile,” and warned of “future crises” if global
imbalances persist.  
 Chalco, ZTE  
 The Hang Seng Finance Index’s 0.7 percent decline was the
biggest among the four industry groups tracked by the Hang Seng
Index.  
 Chalco, as Aluminum Corp. is known, slid 2.1 percent to
HK$5.71.  China Resources Land Ltd. , a state-controlled property
developer, retreated 2.5 percent to HK$14.36. They posted the
biggest drop on the Hang Seng Index.  
 A Chinese services industry index fell for a third month in
June to 55.6 from 56.4, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
said. That adds to manufacturing indexes last week and a
services index released July 3 in signaling that growth is
slowing as the government cracks down on property speculation
and the effects of stimulus measures fade.  
 China Cosco declined 4.1 percent to HK$7.49, its lowest
close since May 2009. China Shipping Container Lines Co., the
nation’s No. 2 shipping company by market value, lost 2.9
percent to HK$2.65.  
 The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of commodity-shipping costs,
fell 3 percent on July 2. The gauge has declined for 26 straight
days, its longest losing streak since August 2005.  
 Futures on the Hang Seng Index declined 0.5 percent to
19,780.
