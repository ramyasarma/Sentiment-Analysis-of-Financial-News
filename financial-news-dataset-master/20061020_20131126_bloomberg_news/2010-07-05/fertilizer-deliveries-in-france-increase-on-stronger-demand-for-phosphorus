             French fertilizer deliveries gained
in the year through April on demand for crop nutrients
phosphorus and potassium, the national fertilizer industry
association said.  
 Deliveries of phosphorus fertilizer more than doubled to
293,000 metric tons, Paris-based Unifa reported on its  website 
today, without providing year-earlier figures. Shipments of
potassium fertilizer climbed 24 percent to 374,000 tons.  
 France, the European Union’s largest farm producer, is also
the region’s biggest consumer of crop nutrients, according to
the International Fertilizer Industry Association. French
farmers used less fertilizer last year after prices jumped at
the end of 2008.  
 “At the end of April, deliveries passed the figures of the
previous campaign on the same data,” Unifa said. “Even so,
deliveries remain well below those in 2008 and the recovery is
therefore very partial.”  
 French deliveries of nitrogen-based fertilizer in the 10
months through April rose 3 percent to 5.08 million tons,
according to Unifa. The association tracks deliveries for
nitrogen on the basis of a year through June 30.  
 “This recovery, following the crisis of 2009, is bigger in
phosphorus than in nitrogen and potassium,” Unifa said.  
 Compound-fertilizer deliveries came to 1.69 million tons at
the end of April, up 5 percent from a year earlier. Overall
fertilizer deliveries as of April 30 climbed to 7.43 million
tons, up 6.6 percent from 6.97 million tons a year earlier.  
 Unifa’s use of different reporting periods for nutrients
means the figures for compounds and total deliveries include
both 10- and 12-month data.
