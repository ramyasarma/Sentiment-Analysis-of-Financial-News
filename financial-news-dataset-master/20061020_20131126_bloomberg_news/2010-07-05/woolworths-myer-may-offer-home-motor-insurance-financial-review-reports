             Woolworths Ltd. and Myer Holdings
Ltd. may begin selling home and motor insurance as they seek to
use their retail customer base to win a share of the A$20
billion market, the Australian Financial Review reported. Both
companies have put their insurance business out to tender and
are following the lead of rival Wesfarmers Ltd. which sells
insurance through its Coles and Kmart outlets, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.
