             Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd. , the
subject of a A$707 million ($594 million) takeover offer from
 Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. , fell to the lowest in six weeks
in Australian trading on speculation the deal won’t succeed.  
 Sigma, Australia’s biggest drugs distributor, dropped 2.5
percent to 39.5 Australian cents, the lowest since May 20, the
day before Aspen’s A$0.60-a-share offer was announced. Ian Smith,
an external spokesman for Sigma, and Shauneen Beukes, an
external spokeswoman for Durban, South Africa-based Aspen,
declined to comment.  
 Aspen has until today to complete a review of Sigma’s
financial accounts. Sigma shares have traded below the offer
price amid concern that the Melbourne-based company  will miss 
its full-year  profit forecast  after three top executives
announced their resignation. Sigma in March reported a record
loss, triggering a 48 percent one-day plunge in the stock.  
 “Expectations of Aspen formalizing a bid at A$0.60 are
low,” said  David Arter , a health-care analyst at Wilson HTM
Investment Group in Brisbane, in an e-mail.  
 Today’s stock price decline values Sigma at A$466 million.
