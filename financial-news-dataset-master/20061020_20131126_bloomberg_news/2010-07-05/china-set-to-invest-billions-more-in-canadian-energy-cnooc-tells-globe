             Zheng Li, president of Cnooc Ltd.’s
Canadian unit, said Chinese companies may spend billions of
dollars on Canadian oil and gas properties in coming years as
China looks for energy around the world, the Globe and Mail
reported.  
 Chinese companies will be spurred to look at Canada
following new mandates to invest overseas and an easing of
travel restrictions to Canada, the Globe said today, citing an
interview with the executive.  
 Cnooc Canada, a unit of  China National Offshore Oil Corp. ,
became one of the first Chinese companies to invest in Canada’s
oil industry when it paid C$150 million ($141 million) for a 17
percent stake in MEG Energy Corp. in 2005, the newspaper said.
