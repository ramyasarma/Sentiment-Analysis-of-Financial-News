             Gala Coral Group Ltd., the U.K.
gaming company taken over by creditors last month, is seeking
permission from lenders to sell as much as 600 million pounds
($907 million) of high-yield bonds, according to two people
familiar with the situation.  
 Gala would use the money to repay senior debt, the people
said, declining to be identified because discussions are
private. The Nottingham, England-based company would have a year
to complete the sale if consent is granted, the people said.  
 A group led by Leon Black’s Apollo Global Management LLC
took control of Gala in June in exchange for writing down the
company’s debt to $2.9 billion from $3.9 billion. The U.K.’s
2007 ban on smoking in public places sapped Gala’s bingo and
casino business.  
 “It doesn’t look like an easy deal to pull off,” said
Tatjana Greil Castro, who manages about $1 billion of high-yield
debt at Muzinich & Co. Ltd. in London.  
 The yield premium investors demand to buy high-yield debt
has risen 20 basis points to 792 basis points since the
beginning of the year, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data. High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by
Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.  
 Mike Smith, a London-based spokesman for the company
declined to comment.
