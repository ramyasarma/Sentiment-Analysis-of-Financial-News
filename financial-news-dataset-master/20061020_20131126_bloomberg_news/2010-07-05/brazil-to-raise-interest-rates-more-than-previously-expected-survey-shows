             Brazilian economists raised their
forecast for the country’s benchmark interest rate as the
economy grows faster than was previously expected.  
 Central bank policy makers will raise the interest rate to
12.13 percent by year-end, up from a week-earlier forecast of 12
percent, according to a July 2 central bank survey of about 100
economists released today. Economists raised their inflation
forecast for the next 12 months to 4.86 percent from 4.82
percent. The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus
or minus two percentage points.  
 Economic growth that may reach 6.5 percent this year is
“clearly above” Brazil’s potential of 4.5 percent, said
 Roberto Padovani , chief economist at Banco WestLB do Brasil.  
 “There’s a combination of stronger growth and inflation
expectations above the target,” Padovani said in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo. “In this scenario, it’s necessary to
tighten monetary policy. The economy is very heated.”  
 Brazil’s real halted a three-day rally, falling 0.2 percent
to 1.7750 per U.S. dollar at 9:50 a.m. New York time. The yield
on interest-rate future contracts due in January, the second-
most traded on the BM&F exchange, rose 1 basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 11.32 percent.  
 Economists left unchanged their forecast for  inflation 
reaching 5.55 percent by year-end and slowing to 4.8 percent by
the end of 2011, the survey showed. Gross domestic product may
expand 7.2 percent this year, faster than a 7.13 percent
forecast a week ago.  
 Latin America’s biggest economy expanded 9 percent in the
first quarter, its fastest pace in more than two decades.  
 Policy makers may raise the Selic rate to 11 percent this
month, after increasing borrowing costs in their last two
meetings to 10.25 percent from a record low 8.75 percent in
March, the survey showed.  
 Padovani expects policy makers to raise the Selic 75 basis
points at their next meeting July 20-21 as well at their
September meeting.
