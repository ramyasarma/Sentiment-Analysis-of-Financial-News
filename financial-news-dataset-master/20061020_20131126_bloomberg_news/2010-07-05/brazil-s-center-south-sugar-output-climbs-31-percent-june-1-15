             Sugar output in Brazil’s Center
South, the world’s biggest producing region, rose 31 percent in
the first half of June, industry association Unica said.  
 Production increased to 2.3 million metric tons between
June 1 and June 15, from 1.76 million tons in the year-earlier
period,  Unica  said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 Growers in the Center South, where about 90 percent of
Brazil’s sugar and ethanol is produced, harvested 39.6 million
tons of sugar cane in the period, up 19 percent, Unica said.  
 Mills turned 55 percent of the cane into ethanol, compared
with 57 percent a year ago. Ethanol output rose 18 percent to
1.71 billion liters (452 million gallons) in the period.  
 Brazil’s Center South will produce 34.1 million tons of
sugar this year, up from 28.6 million tons last year, Unica said
March 31. Unica reiterated today that it may cut its sugar-cane
forecast in coming months should dry weather hurt crop yields by
the harvest end.
