             Copper rose for a second day in
London on speculation that last week’s drop was exaggerated at a
time when inventories of metal are at a seven-month low,
indicating steady demand.  
 Stockpiles tracked by the London Metal Exchange fell for a
12th day today and have slid for 33 of the past 34 sessions.
Bookings to remove copper from LME warehouses increased to the
highest level in almost four months on July 1.  
 “Prices are creeping higher after the strong losses last
week,”  Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt, said by phone.  
 Copper for delivery in three months climbed $90, or 1.4
percent, to $6,500 a metric ton at 5:14 p.m. on the LME. The
contract lost 5.3 percent last week. Futures for September
delivery gained 0.7 percent to $2.9365 a pound on the Comex in
New York.  
 Weinberg predicted “thin trading,” citing the U.S.
Independence Day holiday. Comex floor trading is shut today.
Investors bought and sold 4,660 three-month copper contracts in
London, less than 15 percent of the total for July 2, last
week’s slowest day of trading by volume.  
 LME prices last week dropped the most since the week ended
June 4 as figures showed slower growth in manufacturing in
China, the world’s top copper consumer. Auto sales in the
country weakened in June and a services-industry index slid to a
15-month low, adding to signs that the economy leading the world
recovery is cooling, reports showed today.  
 Car Sales  
 Passenger-car purchases rose 10.9 percent from a year
earlier, down from May’s 25 percent gain, the China Automotive
Technology & Research Center said. The services-industry measure
fell to 55.6 from 56.4, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “The government-orchestrated slowdown in China”
contributed to Citigroup Inc.’s decision to cut its forecast for
copper prices in this year’s second half, analyst  Alan Heap  in
Sydney wrote in a report today. He also cited “prospects of a
stalled recovery in the developed economies (Europe in
particular).”  
 Copper will average $3.10 a pound ($6,834 a ton) in the
half, 15 percent below its prior estimate, Citigroup said. The
metal will average $3.29 next year, 9 percent less than
predicted previously, according to the report.  
 Slowing Momentum  
 Concern about tighter monetary policy in China and the
potential impact on demand of Europe’s fiscal crisis have helped
to pull LME copper down 12 percent this year. Growth in Europe’s
services and manufacturing industries slowed in June, Markit
said, adding to signs a recovery is losing momentum.  
 The chance that Europe’s economy may return to recession
“is rising fast and is at its highest since the recovery
started more than a year ago,”  Nick Moore , head of commodity
strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said in a report
e-mailed today. “Absent an effective policy intervention to
tackle the debt crisis in the periphery over the coming months,
the European economy will double-dip in 2011.”  
 A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in both services and manufacturing fell to 56 from 56.4
in May, Markit said. An index of services retreated to 55.5 from
56.2. A gauge of euro-area manufacturing declined to 55.6 from
55.8 in the previous month, Markit said on July 1.  
 LME copper stockpiles fell to 444,500 tons, the lowest
level since Dec. 2. Canceled warrants, as the bookings are
known, slid 4.8 percent to 33,325 tons, the second drop in a
row.  
 Nickel for three-month delivery on the LME slipped 0.3
percent to $18,744 a ton, erasing a gain of as much as 2.3
percent. Vale SA reached a “tentative” agreement for a new
contract with workers in Canada who have been on strike for a
year, the longest labor dispute in Vale’s 67-year history.  
 Aluminum was little changed at $1,937 a ton and lead rose
0.4 percent to $1,760 a ton. Zinc climbed 1.6 percent to $1,808
a ton and tin rose 0.4 percent to $17,300 a ton.
