             Fast Retailing Co. , Japan’s
largest clothing chain, declined to the lowest in about three
weeks in Tokyo trading after domestic sales at its Uniqlo
stores fell and Nomura Securities Co. cut its  rating .  
 The stock  fell  1.8 percent to 13,190 yen, the lowest
since June 10, at the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.  Fast Retailing  was the third-worst performer on the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average, which gained 0.7 percent today.  
 Fast Retailing, which operates the Uniqlo chain, on July
2 posted a decrease in June sales, its fourth drop in monthly
revenue this year, as promotions centered on jogging and
other sports failed to attract more customers.  
 “The company’s efficiency in marketing is falling,
which may worsen its profit structure,”  Masafumi Shoda , an
analyst at Nomura, said in a report on July 2. “Fast
Retailing is losing its sales momentum,” as promotions
linked to sports failed.  
 He cut his recommendation on Fast Retailing to
“neutral” from “buy” and lowered his 12-month target
price to 15,000 yen from 18,000 yen.  
 The company, based in Yamaguchi prefecture, is expanding
overseas with plans to enter Taiwan and Malaysia this year to
offset falling demand in its domestic market.
