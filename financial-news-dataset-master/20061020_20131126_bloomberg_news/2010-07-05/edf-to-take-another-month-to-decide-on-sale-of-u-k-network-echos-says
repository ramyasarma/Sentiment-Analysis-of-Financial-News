              Electricite de France SA plans to
take another month to decide on whether to sell its U.K.
distribution network to cut debt, French daily Les Echos
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 A decision was to have been made in June and was delayed as
EDF sought to clarify the pension obligations to be met by
potential purchasers, the newspaper said. The company could
decide to sell other assets to cut debt, Les Echos added.  
 EDF is also preparing a plan to reduce purchasing costs,
Les Echos reported. The company will give the amount of the
targeted savings at the start of 2011, the newspaper said,
adding that unidentified analysts expect EDF to be able to save
more than 1 billion euros.
