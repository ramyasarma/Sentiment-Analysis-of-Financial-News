             E.ON AG  Chief Executive Officer
 Johannes Teyssen  plans to turn the utility’s Dusseldorf-based
holding company into the center of operations,  Financial Times
Deutschland  said, without saying where it got the information.  
 That would mean that E.ON’s subsidiaries, E.ON Energie in
Munich and E.ON Ruhrgas in Essen would become less important,
the newspaper said.
