             Singamas Container Holdings Ltd.’s
factories are full until September as demand for shipping
containers recovers, the South China Morning Post reported,
citing Singamas Chief Executive Officer Teo Siong Seng. The
company’s 12 factories in China have been producing about
65,000 20-foot-equivalent units a month, the Hong Kong-based
newspaper said.
