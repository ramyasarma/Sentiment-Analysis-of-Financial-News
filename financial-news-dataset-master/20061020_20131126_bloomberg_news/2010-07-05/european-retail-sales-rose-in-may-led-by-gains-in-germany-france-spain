             European  retail sales  rose in May as
households in Germany, France and Spain stepped up spending.  
 Sales in the 16-nation euro area rose 0.2 percent from
April, when they fell 0.9 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Economists had
forecast a gain of 0.3 percent, the median of 19 estimates in a
 Bloomberg News survey  showed. In the year,  sales  rose 0.3
percent.  
 European consumers may hold back spending over the coming
months after  unemployment  remained at the highest in almost 12
years in May and governments pledged to tackle budget deficits
with tougher austerity measures.  Patrick Thomas , chief executive
officer of luxury-goods maker  Hermes International SCA , said on
June 7 that “many questions remain” about 2010. European
 services growth  slowed in June, a report showed today.  
 There are concerns that the “euro-region debt crisis and
an associated intensified tightening of fiscal policy in a
number of countries is having a dampening impact on economic
activity,” said  Howard Archer , chief European economist at IHS
Global Insight in London. “It looks very likely that there will
be renewed moderation in growth in the third quarter.”  
 In the 27-nation EU, retail sales rose 0.4 in May from the
previous month and increased 0.5 percent from a year earlier,
today’s report showed. In Germany, retail sales rose 0.4 percent
in the month, while Spanish sales increased 0.3 percent. In
France, sales rose 0.2 percent from April.
