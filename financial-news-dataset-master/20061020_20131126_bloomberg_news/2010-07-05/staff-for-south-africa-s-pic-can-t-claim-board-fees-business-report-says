             Employees of the Public Investment
Corp., which manages 800 billion rand ($103 billion) in South
African government pensions, have no claim on fees they may earn
as directors of companies that the PIC is invested in,  Business
Report  said, citing a court judgment.  
 Fees paid to employees of the PIC are the property of the
pension fund it manages and not of the individuals, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper reported, citing a judge it didn’t
identify. The case referred to former PIC employee Kagiso
Bodigelo who wanted to keep 2.3 million rand ($298,000) in
director fees from four companies.
