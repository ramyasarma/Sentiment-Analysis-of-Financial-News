             President  Barack Obama  today thanked
military families for their service at an Independence Day
celebration on the South Lawn of the White House.  
 “You are the men and women who toil to defend these
states,” Obama told about 1,200 members of the U.S. Armed
Forces and their families. “And you have earned your place
among the greatest of generations.”  
 For the second year in a row, Obama welcomed members of the
Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard and their
families to the White House to view the annual fireworks display
on the  National Mall .  
 He told them to “relax and have some fun today,” the
234th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence.  
 Obama said the principles of liberty in that document have
helped make the U.S. “a beacon to the world.”  
 “We constantly have to work in order to perfect our
union,” he said. “And that work is never truly done.”  
 Vice President  Joe Biden , in his Fourth of July remarks
during a visit with U.S. troops and Iraqi leaders in Baghdad,
said America stands with the Iraqis as they build a new country.  
 “My plea to you is, finish what you’ve started, a truly
legitimate and representative government that meets the needs
and aspirations of all Iraqi people,” Biden said at a Fourth of
July reception. “ We have nothing more than to want you to grow
as an independent, prosperous democracy.”  
 The U.S. is preparing to reduce its forces in Iraq to
50,000 from 86,000 later this year, before a full withdrawal
next year. Obama pledged to keep to that timetable.  
 “We are poised to end our combat mission in Iraq this
summer, on schedule,” he said.
