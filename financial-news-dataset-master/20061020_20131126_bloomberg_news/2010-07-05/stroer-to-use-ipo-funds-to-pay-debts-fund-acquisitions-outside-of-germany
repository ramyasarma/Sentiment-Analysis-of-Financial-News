              Stroer Out-of-Home Media AG, the
outdoor advertising provider that’s selling new shares this
month, aims to use the proceeds to repay debt, buy new digital
billboards and fund acquisitions in Turkey and Poland.  
 Stroer, based in Cologne, Germany, will use at least 81
million euros ($101 million) of an estimated 275 million euros
in proceeds from the initial public offering in part to increase
its stake in Turkish joint venture Stroer Kentvizyon to 90
percent from 50 percent, said Chief Financial Officer  Alfried Buehrdel  at a press conference in Frankfurt today. It will also
use the funds to acquire News Outdoor Poland, owned by News
Corp., he said. An additional 151 million euros are earmarked to
repay debt.  
 Stroer, which was founded in a Berlin garage shortly after
the fall of the Berlin Wall, says it’s the biggest outdoor
advertiser in Germany and Turkey by net sales. The company plans
to take the top spot in Poland after purchasing News Outdoor
Poland. It made a profit of 1.1 million euros last year after a
loss of 14.6 million euros in 2008.  
 Stroer chose July for the listing, the fifth in Frankfurt
this year, because it “felt the summer was stable,” said
Buehrdel.  
 Bilfinger Berger AG, Germany’s second-largest construction
company, today postponed a planned initial share sale of its
Australian unit, citing declining stock markets. Bilfinger
Berger fell 1.44 euros, or 3.3 percent, to 42.90 euros in
Frankfurt trading.
