             The European Commission said it isn’t
pressing Greece to make deeper cuts in its budget.  
 European Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn
doesn’t plan to visit Athens in the near future and “nor do we
envision a call for additional measures,” EU spokesman Amadeu
Altafaj told reporters in Brussels today. “There is no
intention to change this program.”
