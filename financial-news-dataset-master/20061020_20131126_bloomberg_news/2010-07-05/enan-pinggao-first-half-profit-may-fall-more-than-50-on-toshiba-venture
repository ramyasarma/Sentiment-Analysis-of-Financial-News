             Henan Pinggao Electric Co. said
first-half net income may decline more than 50 percent from a
year earlier, according to a statement on the website of
Shanghai’s stock exchange.  
 Operating profit from a venture with Toshiba Corp. declined
due to sales volumes, prices and the Japanese yen, resulting in
the drop in Henan Pinggao Electric’s net income, the Chinese
company said in the statement without giving more details.
