             Reliance Industries Ltd. , owner of
the world’s biggest refining complex, more than doubled Latin
American crude oil imports this year as slack U.S. demand
increased supplies,  JBC Energy GMbh  said.  
 Reliance bought 380,000 barrels a day of crude from
Venezuela, Mexico and Brazil and other smaller suppliers from
January to April, compared with 155,000 barrels a day during all
of 2009, the Vienna-based energy consultancy said in an e-mailed
report today.  
 “The wide-ranging buying habits of Indian refiners are a
reflection of a market that is brimming with barrels, which has
created a buyers’ market,” JBC Energy said. “Latin American
producers facing a dismal demand situation in the U.S. have been
more than happy to sell their crude to Reliance.”  
 Reliance spokesman  Manoj Warrier  declined to comment on the
report.  
 Venezuela accounted for 59 percent, Mexico 21 percent and
Brazil 14 percent of Reliance’s Latin American crude imports,
the consultancy said. Reliance runs the 1.24 million barrel-a-
day Jamnagar complex on India’s northwest coast.  
 Overall, 31 percent of India’s crude imports, or 17.8
million tons, were shipped from west of the Suez Canal in the
four months to April, according to JBC Energy. The waterway
links the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea and is a major
corridor for crude oil shipments.
