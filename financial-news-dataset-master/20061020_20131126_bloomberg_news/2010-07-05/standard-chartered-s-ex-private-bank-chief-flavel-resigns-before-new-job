             Peter Flavel , the former head of
 Standard Chartered Plc’s  private bank, left the company just as
he was scheduled to begin his new job as global head of personal
banking.  
 “Peter has decided to pursue a career outside of the
bank,” Ally Lim, a spokeswoman for the bank, said in an e-mailed
statement. “He made a significant contribution to building the
private bank over the last three years.” James Galloway,
currently chief marketing officer, will assume Flavel’s
responsibilities, she said.  
 Standard Chartered appointed Flavel, who started the
private bank three years ago, to his new role in April and named
 Shayne Nelson  to replace him. Flavel was supposed to move to
Hong Kong from Singapore and start his new job on July 1,
reporting to consumer banking head  Steve Bertamini . He left the
company on July 2, Lim said.
