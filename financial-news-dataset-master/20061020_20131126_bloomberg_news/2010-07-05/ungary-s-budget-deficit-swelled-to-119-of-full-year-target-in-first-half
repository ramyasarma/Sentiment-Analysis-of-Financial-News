             Hungary, which is implementing a
special tax on financial institutions to reduce the  budget
deficit  to a creditor-approved target, had a shortfall of 119
percent of its full-year goal in the first half.  
 The deficit was 1.03 trillion forint ($4.5 billion) through
June, the Budapest-based  Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The full-year target is 870.3 billion forint.
The gap in June was 297.4 billion forint.  
 Officials from the  International Monetary Fund  and the
European Union, which provided Hungary with the bulk of a 20
billion-euro ($25 billion) bailout in 2008, will begin a review
of the country’s budget policies tomorrow. The government has
pledged to reduce the shortfall to 3.8 percent of GDP this year.  
 Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  had sought a wider shortfall
during his election campaign to favor economic growth after the
worst recession since 1991 last year. The cabinet reversed
course last month after comments by ruling-party officials
comparing Hungary with Greece pushed the forint to a 12-month
low against the euro.  
 The shortfall was 4 percent of GDP in the first quarter,
matching the average for last year, the statistics office said.  
 The cabinet is seeking IMF and EU approval to increase the
deficit target for next year to between 3 percent of GDP and 3.8
percent of GDP from the current 2.8 percent in exchange for
“structural” economic reforms, including merging state
agencies at the county level, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy 
said in a July 2 interview. The government is committed to
narrowing the shortfall next year, Matolcsy said.  
 The government wants to impose a 187 billion forint ($824
million) tax on financial institutions, including a 120 billion
forint levy on lenders. The Cabinet failed to complete an
agreement with banks last week after the owners of six banks
withdrew the negotiating mandate of their local units, Matolcsy
said.
