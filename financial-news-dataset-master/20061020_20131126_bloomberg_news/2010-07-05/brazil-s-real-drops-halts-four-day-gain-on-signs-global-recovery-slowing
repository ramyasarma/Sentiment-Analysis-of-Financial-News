             Brazil’s real fell for the first time
in four sessions on speculation the global economic recovery
will slow, sparking concern that demand for the South American
nation’s exports will weaken.  
 The real lost 0.3 percent to 1.7774 per dollar, from 1.7721
on July 2. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 0.9.  
 European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  urged
“austerity” measures to contain budget deficits yesterday,
following reports last week that showed U.S. payrolls dropped
for the first time this year and factory orders slumped.  
 “The increase of risk aversion in the international
markets and the decrease in commodity prices, reflecting the
worse expectations for the global economy recently, put pressure
on the real,”  Silvio Campos Neto , chief economist at Banco
Schahin SA, said in an e-mail from Sao Paulo. “The good shape
of the Brazilian economy” and the prospect of additional hikes
in interest rates are boosting the real, he said.  
 A July 2 central bank survey of about 100 economists showed
policy makers will raise the benchmark interest rate to 12.13
percent by year-end, up from a week-earlier forecast of 12
percent. Latin America’s biggest economy may expand 7.2 percent
this year, faster than the 7.13 percent forecast a week ago.  
 “It’s hard to decide which signal will prevail,” Campos
Neto said.  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January was unchanged at 11.31 percent.
