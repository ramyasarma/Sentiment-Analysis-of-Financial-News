             Daiwa Securities Group Inc. , Japan’s
second-largest brokerage, agreed to buy  KBC Groep NV ’s
convertible bond unit and its Asia equity derivatives business
for about $1 billion.  
 Under the agreement, Daiwa is paying about $200 million for
assets and about $800 million for the trading position, the
companies said in a joint statement today. The transaction is
subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed
early in the fourth quarter, according to the release.  
 Daiwa Chief Executive Officer  Shigeharu Suzuki  is expanding
broking and investment banking operations globally after ending
a decade-long venture with  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc .
in December. The acquisition will help Daiwa boost revenue at
its equities and bond business by about 15 billion yen ($171
million) annually, said Kenichi Kanda, a Tokyo-based spokesman.  
 “With this acquisition we demonstrate our commitment not
just to growing in Asia, but also to building a globally
competitive derivatives business,”  Toshinao Matsushima , global
head of markets at Daiwa, said in the statement.  
 The brokerage in April posted an unexpected quarterly loss
even as main local rival Nomura Holdings Inc., which bought
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s Asian and European operation in
2008, returned to profit.  
 Daiwa  earned  121 billion yen from its equities and bond
businesses in the fiscal year ended March 31, Kanda said.  
 KBC, Belgium’s biggest bank by market value, said the
transaction will result in an increase in its Tier 1 capital
ratio of 10 basis points. Over the last two years, the Global
Convertible Bond and Asia Equity Derivatives units contributed
about 2 percent of KBC Groep’s  profit , the company said.  
 A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
