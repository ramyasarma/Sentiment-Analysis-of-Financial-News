             Citigroup Inc. has decided to keep
South Korea out of its  World Government Bond Index  following a
review, according to Kim Yi Tae, foreign-exchange market
director at the finance ministry.  
 Government bonds were lower after the announcement, with
the yield on the 3.75 percent note maturing in June 2013 up
three basis points at 3.84 percent.  
 South Korea’s government securities could attract as much
as 11 trillion won ($9.8 billion) in additional foreign-fund
inflows should Citigroup add Korea to its World Government Bond
Index, Barclays Plc estimated in April. Citigroup in July 2007
estimated that global investors with $1 trillion tracked their
fund performance against its global benchmark.  
 Citigroup’s index consists of government bonds from 23
countries. Only Japan, Australia, Singapore and Malaysia are
included from the Asia-Pacific region.
