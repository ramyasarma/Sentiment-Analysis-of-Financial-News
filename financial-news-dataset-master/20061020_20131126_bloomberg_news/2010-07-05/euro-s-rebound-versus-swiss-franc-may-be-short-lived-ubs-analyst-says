             The euro’s rebound from its record
low against the franc may be short-lived amid central banks’
demand for the Swiss currency and Switzerland’s relatively
stronger fiscal outlook, according to UBS AG.  
 The euro is a “medium-term sell on rallies” as the risk
of the Swiss National Bank intervening to weaken its currency
have receded, wrote  Mansoor Mohi-uddin , the global head of
currency strategy at UBS AG in Singapore.  
 “Switzerland’s economy continues to outperform the euro
zone, central banks are showing more interest in the franc as a
reserve currency, and the government’s fiscal position remains
enviable,” Mohi-uddin said in an e-mailed note.  
 The euro weakened to 1.3074 francs on July 1, the lowest
since its 1999 debut, before recovering to 1.3342 as of 8:10
a.m. in London today. UBS retains its three-month forecast for
the euro at 1.35 francs, Mohi-uddin said.  
 “We see the risks being to the downside to that forecast
even after the jump from around 1.30 over the last few days,”
he wrote.  
 The euro has lost 10 percent against the franc so far this
year on speculation that the debt crisis in the euro region
means the European Central Bank will lag behind the SNB in
increasing interest rates.
