             Taiwan’s  consumer prices  rose in June
for a sixth month, driven by higher international energy costs
on the island that imports 99 percent of its crude oil.  
 The consumer price index advanced 1.18 percent from a year
earlier, the state statistics bureau said today in Taipei. That
compared with the median  estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey of
12 economists for a 1.01 percent increase. Prices rose a revised
0.75 percent in May.  
 Taiwan’s central bank last month unexpectedly raised the
benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008, saying
the move reflected the global and domestic recoveries. The
economy expanded 13.3 percent in the first quarters, the most
since 1978, and the statistics bureau raised its 2010 inflation
forecast to 1.4 percent from 1.27 percent in May.  
 “The economic recovery and improving job market are
boosting consumption and end demand,” said  Chuang Rehong , an
economist at SinoPac Securities Corp. in Taipei. “We expect a
moderate price increase in the coming months.”  
 The average crude oil price in June rose 8.2 percent from
a year earlier, according to the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 CPC Corp. , Taiwan’s state-owned oil refiner, raised domestic
gasoline and diesel prices by 70 NT cents (2.2 cents) a liter in
the last week of June from a year earlier.  
 Fuel prices rose 4.79 percent from a year earlier and food
prices increased 1.65 percent, after declining 0.41 percent in
May, today’s report showed. Housing costs rose 0.7 percent and
the price of transportation advanced 1.6 percent.  
 Core consumer prices , a category excluding vegetables,
fruit, fish and energy, climbed 0.63 percent after increasing
0.2 percent in May.  
 Wholesale prices, which track the cost of goods sold to
retailers and producers, climbed 7.18 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a 9.41 percent rise in May.
