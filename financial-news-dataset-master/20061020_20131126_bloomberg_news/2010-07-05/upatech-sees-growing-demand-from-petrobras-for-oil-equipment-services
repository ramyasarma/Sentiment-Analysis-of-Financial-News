             Lupatech SA , Brazil’s biggest oil
equipment and service provider, sees “growing demand” from
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA  for its services as the state-controlled
producer boosts spending to double output in a decade, said
Chief Financial Officer  Thiago Alonso de Oliveira .  
 “We are facing a moment when the things we supply are in a
period of growing demand,” Oliveira said today in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo. “It’s a period when several
discoveries are in the beginning development phase.”  
 Lupatech rose 1.7 percent to 20.70 reais at 11:45 a.m. New
York time in Sao Paulo trading after the company announced a 140
million reais ($79 million) contract for anchor ropes and
services with Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is
known. Lupatech has won a second accord with Petrobras to
provide more polyester ropes, Oliveira said.  
 Petrobras is investing $224 billion in the next five years
to increase production of oil and gasoline, giving Lupatech an
opportunity to expand sales in Brazil, Oliveira said. Petrobras
plans to double output to 5.38 million barrels a day by 2020 as
it taps the largest offshore discoveries in the Americas since
Mexico discovered Cantarell in 1976.  
 Lupatech said on June 14 it won a contract worth 123
million reais to provide onshore services for Petrobras.
