             The rate banks say they charge each
other for three-month loans in euros in London rose to the
highest level in more than nine months, according to the British
Bankers’ Association.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
was at 0.731 percent, the BBA said, the most since Sept. 11,
2009. The rate was 0.727 percent on July 2. The euro Libor-OIS
spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance to lend, gained 0.4 basis
point to 26.3 basis points as of midday in London.  
 Three-month dollar Libor slipped to 0.531 percent from
0.534 percent, the BBA said.
