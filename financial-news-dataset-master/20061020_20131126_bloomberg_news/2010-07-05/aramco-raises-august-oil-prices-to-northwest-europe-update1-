             Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest
state-owned oil company, raised its August official selling
prices for all crude grades to customers in Northwest Europe and
increased Arab Extra Light prices to the U.S. and Asia.  
 The company raised the formula price of its Arab Heavy
grade to Europe the most, advancing it by 95 cents a barrel to a
$3.90 a barrel discount to Brent crude, a person familiar with
the pricing decision said today.  
 Saudi Arabia’s state-owned producer set the price for its
 Extra Light  grade for August loadings for U.S. buyers at a
premium of $1.45 a barrel to the  Argus Sour Crude Index , a 15
cent increase from July cargoes. It raised Extra Light rates to
Asia by the same amount to 80 cents a barrel above the benchmark
Dubai assessment published by Platts.  
 The world’s largest crude exporter shipped more oil to Asia
last year as sales to the U.S. and Europe slipped with the
global economic slump. Oil producers like Saudi Arabia publish
official prices monthly for buyers with term contracts to
reflect shifts in supply and demand for different qualities.  
 Saudi Arabia was the fourth-biggest crude exporter to the
U.S. last year, dropping from second place in 2008, according to
 Energy Information Administration  data. Canada, Mexico and
Venezuela all shipped more oil to the U.S., the data show.  
 The company’s August discounts for shipments of Arab Light-
and Medium-grade crudes to the U.S. were unchanged. Arab Heavy
will cost 10 cents less than in July, as the discount for U.S.
buyers widened to $3.50 a barrel below the Argus index.  
 U.S. Shipments  
 For U.S. shipments, August marks the eighth month Aramco is
pricing against the ASCI marker, an index of high-sulfur oil
produced in the Gulf of Mexico. The benchmark replaced a West
Texas Intermediate crude price published by Platts, the
energy-information division of McGraw Hill Cos. WTI oil, a
lighter, more expensive crude grade, also trades as a futures
contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  
 Saudi Aramco increased the price of Arab Light crude to
Asia by 5 cents from July loadings to a 15 cent-a-barrel
discount to Platts Dubai. It left Arab Medium crude unchanged.
Super Light crude declined 15 cents to $1.10 a barrel above the
marker. The Arab Heavy discount widened 5 cents to $3 a barrel
below the Platts marker.  
 Arab Heavy, the country’s densest grade, was expected to
drop by 35 cents a barrel from the July price, according to the
median estimate of a survey of nine refiners from Japan, Taiwan,
India, China and South Korea. Arab Light, Aramco’s largest
export type, was expected to drop by 10 cents a barrel, the
refiners said in a survey last week.  
 Extra Light  
 Prices for Arab Extra Light and Arab Light to northwest
Europe rose by 75 cents a barrel and Arab Medium advanced 85
cents to a discount of $3.05 a barrel to Brent. Saudi Aramco cut
prices on all grades for Mediterranean buyers except for Arab
Heavy crude, which it left unchanged.  
 Crude for August delivery gained percent 0.6 percent on the
New York Mercantile Exchange during June to close the month at
$75.63 a barrel. Saudi Arabia’s Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi 
said March 30 oil prices in a range of $70 to $80 are “as close
to perfect as possible” and he hopes they remain in that range.  
 Aramco has supplied full crude volumes to refiners in Asia
since December. It lowered prices on most crude grades to Asia
in February, March, April and July, after raising prices on
light grades to the U.S. and Asia for May and June.  
 Oil exports to Asia increased as China bought on average
more than 1 million barrels of Saudi crude a day last year,
Aramco said in its annual review last month. Crude exports to
the U.S. slipped to 14 percent of Aramco’s total last year from
20 percent in 2008, while shipments to Asia were 56 percent of
the total in 2009, compared with a 52.7 percent share in 2008.  
 To gain better access to Asian markets, Aramco last month
agreed with Japan to use idle crude oil storage on the island of
Okinawa. Aramco will be able to store as much as 600,000
kiloliters of crude at the site.
