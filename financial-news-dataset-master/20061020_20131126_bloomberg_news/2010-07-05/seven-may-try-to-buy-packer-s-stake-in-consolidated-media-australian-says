             Seven Group Holdings Ltd. may seek to
buy James Packer’s 48.6 percent stake in Consolidated Media
Holdings Ltd. when a “standstill” agreement expires in two
months, the Australian newspaper reported. With Seven owning
22.1 percent of the stock, Consolidated may drop out of the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index when its current share buyback ends
as the free float of stock would be less than 30 percent, the
newspaper said, citing analyst Sameer Chopra at Merrill Lynch.
