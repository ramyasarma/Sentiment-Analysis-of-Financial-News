             A Chinese services industry index
slid to a 15-month low in June, adding to signs that the world’s
third-biggest  economy  is cooling.  
 The measure fell for a third month to 55.6 from 56.4, HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in an e-mailed  statement .  
 Today’s data adds to manufacturing indexes last week and a
services index released July 3 in signaling that growth is
slowing as the government cracks down on property speculation
and the effects of stimulus measures fade. The Shanghai
Composite Index fell 1.4 percent as of 10:57 a.m. local time,
extending this year’s decline to more than 28 percent.  
 The latest services number “reflects the effect of
property market tightening measures,” said  Qu Hongbin ,  a  Hong
Kong-based economist at HSBC. “This, combined with the
moderating manufacturing production, implies the economy is
cooling off sequentially.”  
 A non-manufacturing index released by the Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing on July 3 slid to 57.4 from 62.7 in May.
