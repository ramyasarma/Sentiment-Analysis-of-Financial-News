             Abengoa SA  surged the most in six
months in Madrid trading after the company won a $1.45 billion
loan guarantee from the U.S. government to build a solar-power
plant in Arizona.  
 Shares in the Spanish solar-technology developer climbed 9
percent to close at 18.015 euros. The stock leg gainers on the
88-member benchmark  WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation
Index , which rose 0.1 percent.  
 U.S. government backing will allow Seville-based Abengoa to
get a cheaper loan, improving the profitability of the power
plant, said  Nathaniel Bullard , the lead North American solar-
energy analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  
 “At a narrow spread, less than 100 basis points over
Treasury rates, a loan guarantee creates economics simply not
possible given finance arranged on the Street or in the City,”
Bullard said in an e-mail.  
 Abengoa’s plant, to be built 70 miles (113 kilometers)
southwest of Phoenix, will be the world’s largest solar-power
installation, producing 250 megawatts and serving 70,000
families, the company said July 3 in a statement.  
 The Solana installation, using solar-thermal technology,
will prevent 475,000 tons in carbon-dioxide emissions annually,
according to the company’s calculations.  
 The company plans to start construction before year-end and
begin generating electricity before the end of 2013,  Santiago Seage , chief executive officer of Abengoa’s solar unit, said in
a July 3 interview.
