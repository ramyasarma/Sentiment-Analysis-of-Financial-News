             Chamartin Meermann Immobilien AG ,
Berlin’s largest developer, called off its public share sale and
the start of its trading on the Frankfurt stock exchange, saying
investor demand hasn’t met expectations.  
 “Reasons for investor restraint were the imponderables
connected with the business of real estate developers,” CMI said
in a statement today. It will consider “listing with a capital
increase at a later stage.”  
 CMI planned to issue as many as 7.3 million shares at a
price range of 7.70 euros ($9.66) to 9.70 euros, it said on June
25. Proceeds would be used to help finance its growth in the
German capital.  
 CMI is the latest German company to halt a share sale amid
European market declines.  Bilfinger Berger AG , Germany’s second-
largest construction company, said today it postponed the
initial share sale of its Australian unit, citing the drop in
stock markets.  GSW Immobilien AG , the real estate company owned
by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Cerberus Capital Management LP,
postponed its share offering on May 5.  
 The German company builds homes, office properties and
hotels in and around Berlin’s government district. It has 27
projects in the German capital including the 464-room Sheraton
Berlin Hotel and the  Palais am Deutschen Theater , which will
have about 21,500 square meters (231,000 square feet) of space
to lease when it is completed.
