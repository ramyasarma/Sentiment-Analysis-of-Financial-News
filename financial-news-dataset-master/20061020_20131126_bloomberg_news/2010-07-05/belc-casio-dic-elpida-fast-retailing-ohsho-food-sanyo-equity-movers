The following were among the most active shares in the

 DIC Corp.  (4631 JT) jumped 7.4 percent to 145 yen, the
sharpest rise since Oct. 26. The ink producer may report

Nikkei English News said.  
 Elpida Memory Inc. (6665 JT) leapt 3.2 percent to 1,331

ultra-small dynamic-random-access chips with three Taiwanese

to 2,124 yen, the steepest drop since October 2008. The

The electronics maker is in talks to sell its semiconductor
operations to  ON Semiconductor Corp.  (ONNN US) of the U.S.
