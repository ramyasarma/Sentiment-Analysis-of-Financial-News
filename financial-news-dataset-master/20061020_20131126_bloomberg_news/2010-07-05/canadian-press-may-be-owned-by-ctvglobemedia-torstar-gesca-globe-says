             The Canadian Press news service
struck a tentative deal to transform itself into a for-profit
company from an industry cooperative, the Globe and Mail
reported.  
 Canadian Press would be owned by Toronto Star publisher
 Torstar Corp. , CTVglobemedia Inc., which owns the Globe and
Mail, and Gesca, which owns La Presse, the Globe said today,
without saying where it obtained the information.  
 The news service struggled after CanWest Global
Communications Corp. ended its subscription in 2007 and Quebecor
Inc., owner of Sun Media Corp., left this year, the newspaper
said. The new agreement is not final and would be subject to
federal government approvals, it said.
