             China’s stocks  declined, driving the
benchmark index to a 15-month low, on concern a slowdown in the
world’s third-largest economy and fundraising by banks will dent
profits and hurt existing shareholders’ stakes.  
 SAIC Motor Corp. paced losses by automakers after China’s
passenger-car sales growth weakened in June.  China Cosco
Holdings Co.  fell among transport companies as a measure of
commodity-shipping rates extended the longest losing streak
since August 2005. Bank of China Ltd. slid 0.9 percent after
announcing plans for a rights offer to replenish capital.  
 “There hasn’t been a change in the government’s tightening
stance,” said  Zhou Xi , a strategist at Bohai Securities Co.
“The economy is slowing and pressure on profits will begin to
grow.”  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  retreated 18.95, or 0.8
percent, to 2,363.95 at the close, the lowest close since April
8, 2009. The gauge fell 6.7 percent last week, the most since
February 2009, after manufacturing growth slowed more than
economists forecast in June and the Conference Board lowered its
April gauge for China’s economic outlook. The CSI 300 Index slid
0.9 percent to 2,512.65 today.  
 A Chinese services industry index compiled by HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics fell to a 15-month low in June,
according to a  statement  today. Power demand growth will
continue to slow “significantly” in July and August after
easing “sharply” last month due to lower demand from heavy
industries, the Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing
energy authorities it didn’t name.  
 Slowing Growth  
 SAIC Motor, China’s largest carmaker, lost 0.7 percent to
12.31 yuan, extending a 39 percent decline this year. Beiqi
Foton Motor Co. slumped 1.6 percent to 16.15 yuan.  
 Sales of cars, sport-utility vehicles and multipurpose
vehicles to consumers rose 10.9 percent from a year earlier, the
China Automotive Technology & Research Center said today. That
compares with 34 percent growth in April and 25 percent in May,
according to the center. Sales growth slowed as the government
tightened credit to control inflation and cool the economy.  
 China Cosco, the nation’s biggest shipping company by
market value, fell 1.4 percent to 8.34 yuan, the lowest close
since January 2009.  China Shipping Development Co. , which ships
crude oil and coal, declined 0.9 percent to 7.93 yuan, a seventh
day of losses.  
 The  Baltic Dry Index , a measure of commodity-shipping costs,
dropped 3 percent to 2,280 points on July 2. The gauge has
declined for 26 straight trading sessions and is down 27 percent
this year.  
 Annual Losses  
 The Shanghai Composite is the world’s third-worst
performing equity market this year with a 28 percent loss on
concern tighter rules for the property market and Europe’s debt
crisis will slow economic growth. Equities also declined as the
nation’s biggest banks announced as much as $45.6 billion in
fundraising after extending  record loans  last year.  
 Losses have sent the benchmark gauge’s price-earnings  ratio 
to 17.6, compared with about 37 times at last year’s August peak.  
 Declines in Chinese stocks may signal the nation’s economic
growth is slowing, said  Mark Mobius , who oversees about $34
billion in emerging markets as executive chairman of Templeton
Asset Management Ltd. in Singapore.  
 The Chinese economy may grow 10 percent “going forward,”
though the pace may fall to 9 percent, he told reporters in
Paris July 2. Mobius said he’s still buying stocks in China.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last week cut its 2010 forecast
for China’s to 10.1 percent from 11.4 percent. The economy
expanded 11.9 percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace in
almost three years.  
 Wen Comments  
 China will maintain policy continuity and flexibility to
ensure “steady and relatively fast” growth and to balance
growth, management of inflation expectations and economic
restructuring, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said July 3 after a visit to
businesses in southern Hunan province.  
 Policy makers face increasing “dilemmas” as the effects
of the global financial crisis become more severe than expected
and worldwide recovery increasingly “zigzags,” Wen was quoted
as saying in a statement on the government’s website yesterday.  
 Bank of China , the nation’s third-largest lender by market
value, dropped 0.9 percent to 3.37 yuan. The Beijing-based
lender said on July 2 it plans to raise as much as 60 billion
yuan ($8.9 billion) in a rights offer in Shanghai and Hong Kong
to replenish capital. The bank will sell as many as 19.56
billion shares in the Shanghai part of the offer.  
 Brokerages fell after China asked the nation’s listed
securities companies to strengthen information management for
better public monitoring and to prevent conflicts of interest.  
 Citic Securities Co. , the nation’s largest brokerage by
market value, slumped 1.5 percent to 11.42 yuan. Haitong
Securities Co., the nation’s second biggest brokerage by market
value, lost 2 percent to 8.97 yuan.  
 The following stocks also rose or fell in China. Stock
symbols are in parentheses after company names:  
 Lucky Film Co.  (600135 CH), a producer of photographic film
and paper, climbed 9.8 percent to 8.72 yuan, the most since
April 2, after saying it will buy production facilities and
equipment from an affiliate for 11.4 million yuan.  
 Sanan Optoelectronics Co.  (600703 CH), a maker of light-
emitting diode wafers, advanced 8.9 percent to 42.30 yuan, the
most in a month, after saying first-half net income may gain
more than 240 percent from a year earlier and a unit of the
company received 57.6 million yuan in government subsidies for
the purchase of equipment from overseas.
