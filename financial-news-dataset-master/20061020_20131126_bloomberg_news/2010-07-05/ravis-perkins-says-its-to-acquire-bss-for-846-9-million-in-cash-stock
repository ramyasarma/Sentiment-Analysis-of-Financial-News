             Travis Perkins Plc , the owner of the
Wickes home-improvement chain, agreed to buy  BSS Group Plc  for
557.6 million pounds ($847 million) to create the U.K.’s largest
plumbing and heating chain.  
 The building-materials supplier offered 232.91 pence cash
and 0.2608 new shares for each BSS share, valuing the business
at 435.8 pence, it said in a statement today. Travis Perkins
began its approach on May 28 with a 433 pence offer, which BSS
said at the time would be acceptable.  
 Merging the two businesses should generate annual pretax
savings of at least 25 million pounds, with Northampton,
England-based Travis Perkins leapfrogging  Wolseley Plc  to the
No. 1 spot in the plumbing-gear market.  
 “There is a strong strategic rationale for the
acquisition,” Travis Perkins Chairman  Robert Walker  said in the
statement.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc and Nomura Holdings Inc. advised Travis
Perkins on the deal, and Lazard Ltd. and RBS Hoare Govett Ltd.
worked with BSS.
