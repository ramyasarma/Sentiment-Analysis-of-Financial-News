             White sugar rose to a two-week high
in London on speculation crop damage will reduce supplies.  
 Thailand’s sugar output for 2010-11 may fall 10 percent to
15 percent from a year earlier because of dry weather in June,
Rabobank International said in a report. In Brazil, the world’s
largest producer, flooding in the country’s northeast may damage
up to 10 percent of the regional crop, analyst  Andy Duff  in Sao
Paulo wrote in the report.  
 Expectations on yields from Brazil are low and “the
weather at the moment is not so great, with drought in parts of
Asia and flash floods in China,” said  Jake Wetherall , a trader
with Rabobank in London.  
 White, or refined, sugar for October delivery advanced
$10.60, or 2.2 percent, to $502.40 a metric ton on the Liffe
exchange in London, the highest closing price since June 18.
Trading of raw sugar on ICE Futures U.S. in New York is shut for
Independence Day.  
 India, the world’s biggest sugar user, will produce
24 million to 25 million tons in the year starting Oct. 1
because of an increase in the area planted with cane, Vinay
Kumar, managing director of the National Federation of
Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd., said on July 1.  
 “If this situation continues, this is the proper time to
lift control on sugar,” Farm Minister Sharad Pawar told
reporters in New Delhi today, referring to prospects for
increased output and the consequent need for reduced imports.  
 The South Asian nation’s government controls the sugar
market by telling mills how much they should sell each month.  
 Cocoa for September delivery rose 22 pounds, or 0.9
percent, to 2,400 pounds ($3,627) a ton on Liffe. Deliveries of
beans to Ivory Coast’s ports of Abidjan and San Pedro from farms
in the interior totaled 14,267 tons in the 10 days to June 30,
according to an industry official with access to the data.  
 Robusta coffee for September delivery slid $40, or 2.3
percent, to $1,710 a ton, the biggest drop since April 27.
