             The cost of protecting Asian and
Australian corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 2 basis points to 136 basis
points as of 8:26 a.m. in Singapore, according to Credit
Agricole CIB. That’s the lowest level since June 28, according
to CMA DataVision in New York.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 3 basis points to
133 basis points as of 10:02 a.m. in Sydney, also the lowest in
a week, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. and CMA. The Markit
iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 136 as of 9:28 a.m. in
Tokyo, Morgan Stanley prices show.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions
of credit quality and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
