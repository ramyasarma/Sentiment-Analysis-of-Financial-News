             New cases of genital warts among
women younger than 27 years in Australia fell 60 percent after a
nationwide program was introduced three years ago to fight the
virus responsible, the University of New South Wales said.  
 The finding will be presented this week at the International
Human Papillomavirus Conference in Montreal, the Sydney-based
university said in an e-mailed statement today.
