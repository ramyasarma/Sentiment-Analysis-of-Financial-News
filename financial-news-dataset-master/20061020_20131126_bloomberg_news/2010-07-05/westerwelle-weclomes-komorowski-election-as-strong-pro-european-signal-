             German Foreign Minister Guido
Westerwelle welcomed the election of Bronislaw Komorowski as
Poland’s president, saying it sent “a strong pro-European
signal.”  
 “It’s the aim of German foreign policy to deepen and
strengthen ties with Poland as it has with France in past
decades,” Westerwelle said in an e-mailed statement today.
“With President Komorowski along with Prime Minister Tusk and
Foreign Minister Sikorski, we’ll have a strong partner to set us
on this course of trust and co-operation.”
