             Bilfinger Berger AG , Germany’s
second-largest construction company, pulled the initial public
offering of its Australian unit Valemus Ltd. after investors
balked at the price the company was seeking.  
 Plans to sell stock in the unit between A$2.20 and A$2.50
apiece “cannot realistically be achieved,” Mannheim-based
Bilfinger said in a statement yesterday. Australia’s benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index has  fallen  14 percent this year and declined
3.1 percent since the IPO to raise as much as A$1.39 billion
($1.2 billion) was announced June 8.  
 Bilfinger, which wanted to sell the business to focus on
its home market and services, was seeking to sell Valemus at as
much as 12 times 2010 earnings compared with the 13.2 times
profit that larger rival  Leighton Holdings Ltd.  trades at. More
than 50 companies have pulled IPOs in the past two months amid
an 8.4 percent sell off of the  MSCI World Index .  
 “There is little appetite for floats unless they are
absolutely priced to clear,” said  Prasad Patkar , who helps
manage about $1.4 billion in Sydney at Platypus Asset Management
Ltd. “It would seem that the investors could not meet vendor
expectations on the price with this IPO.”  
 The IPO would have been Australia’s largest since Myer
Holdings Ltd. sold A$2.1 billion of stock in October. Shares in
Myer, Australia’s largest department store chain, have fallen 21
percent since the IPO and have never traded above the initial
share sale price.  
 Shares Slump  
 Bilfinger  fell  1.44 euros, or 3.3 percent, to 42.90 euros
in Frankfurt trading. The stock has  dropped  20 percent this year,
valuing the construction company at 1.97 billion euros ($2.5
billion).  
 The Valemus sale was being managed by Deutsche Bank AG,
Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty., Macquarie Group Ltd., Commonwealth
Bank of Australia and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 Bilfinger, whose projects have included the Sydney Opera
House and the city’s Anzac Bridge, said it still plans to sell
the business. Valemus last month said it was bidding for five
projects worth about A$6 billion.  
 “Due to the current adverse equity market conditions, we
understand why Bilfinger Berger AG has taken the decision to
postpone the IPO,” Valemus Chief Executive Officer Peter Brecht
said in a separate statement today.
