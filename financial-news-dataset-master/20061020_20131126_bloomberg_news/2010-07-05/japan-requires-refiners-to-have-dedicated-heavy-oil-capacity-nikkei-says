             Japan will require refiners to
dedicate a set amount of their refining capacity to heavy oil,
Nikkei English News said, citing the industry ministry. The aim
is to lower energy costs by using cheaper heavy oil to make more
gasoline, kerosene and other fuel, the report said.  
 The regulation may lead to consolidation in the industry,
the report said.
