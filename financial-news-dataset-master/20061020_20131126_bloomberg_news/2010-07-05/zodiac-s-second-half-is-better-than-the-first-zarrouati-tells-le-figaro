             The second half of Zodiac Aerospace
SA’s financial year will be better than the first, and the
company will show “progression” in its 2010-11 financial year,
Le Figaro reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Olivier
Zarrouati.  
 Zodiac will continue to make acquisitions after the
purchase of Germany company Sell, Zarrouati was cited as saying.
