             The Global Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy Fund, or  Geeref , mainly  invested  by the
European Union, will put 10 million euros ($12.5 million) in a
private Chinese fund, the EU’s energy commissioner said.  
 “China is one of the world’s leading countries in terms of
renewable energy investment,”  Guenther Oettinger  said at a
media briefing in Shanghai today.  
 China, the world’s biggest polluter, aims to cut carbon
emissions per unit of gross domestic product by as much as 45
percent of 2005 levels by 2020. The country joins the U.S. as
the most attractive location in which to invest in renewable
energy after spending $34.6 billion on clean-fuel projects last
year, Ernst & Young LLP said in a report in June.  
 The Chinese fund, known as China GreenStar Resource
Utilization Investment Fund, is the country’s first private
equity fund with a focus on energy efficiency and emissions
reduction projects, Oettinger said.  
 Geeref invests in private equity funds that provide
financing to small and medium-sized projects. As of September
last year, Geeref has reached 108 million euros in size,
according to the fund’s  website .  
 The fund is advised by the European Investment Fund to
provide clean energy to emerging countries and economies in
transition. Germany and Norway are Geeref’s other investors.
