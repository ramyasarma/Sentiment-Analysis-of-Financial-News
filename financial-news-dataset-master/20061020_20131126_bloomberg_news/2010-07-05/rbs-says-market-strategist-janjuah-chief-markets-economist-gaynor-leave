             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  said
Chief Markets Strategist  Bob Janjuah  and Chief Markets Economist
 Kevin Gaynor  have left the bank.  
 RBS  will continue to provide research with its team of
strategists based in London, the Asia Pacific region and the
U.S., the Edinburgh-based bank said today in a statement. Global
economic research will be led by Chief European Economist
 Jacques Cailloux .  
 “We have a strong research franchise that we will continue
to grow,” said RBS in the statement.  
 In May, the government-owned bank’s Chief Executive Officer
 Stephen Hester  said that 2010 will be the final year during
which it suffers a “damaging” loss of employees. RBS received
a 45.5 billion-pound ($69 billion) government bailout after it
posted a record loss in 2008.  
 Janjuah declined to comment, while Gaynor wasn’t
immediately available to comment. Janjuah previously held roles
at ABN Amro Holding NV and Bear Stearns Cos. before joining RBS.
Gaynor joined RBS in 2005 from UBS AG, where he was head of
European equity strategy.  
 RBS declined 2.8 percent to 38.96 pence in London, valuing
the bank at 22.6 billion pounds.
