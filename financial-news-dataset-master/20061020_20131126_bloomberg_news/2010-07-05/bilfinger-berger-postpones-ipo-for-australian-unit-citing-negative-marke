             Bilfinger Berger AG , Germany’s
second-largest construction company,  postponed  the initial share
sale of its Australian unit, citing declining stock markets.  
 The Valemus Ltd. division was unable secure enough investor
demand at a price of A$2.20 to A$2.50 a share because of
“adverse conditions on the stock exchange,” Mannheim-based
Bilfinger said today in a statement.  
 Bilfinger set a target in June of raising as much as A$1.39
billion ($1.16 billion) in Valemus’s initial public offering,
part of the German company’s effort to focus on services.
Bilfinger said today that it remains committed to selling the
division, whose projects have included the Sydney Opera House
and the city’s Anzac Bridge, and reducing the  volume  of the
construction business in total sales.  
 Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index has dropped 13
percent this year while its counterpart in Germany, the DAX, has
declined 2.1 percent. Bilfinger’s larger competitor, Essen-based
Hochtief AG, shelved a plan in December to raise as much as
1 billion euros ($1.25 billion) in an initial share sale of the
Hochtief Concessions toll-road and airport management unit.  
 Bilfinger Berger  fell  as much as 1.43 euros, or 3.2
percent, to 42.91 euros, the  lowest  intraday price since May 26,
and was down 3.2 percent as of 4:46 p.m. in Frankfurt trading.
The stock has  dropped  20 percent this year, valuing the
construction company at 1.98 billion euros.
