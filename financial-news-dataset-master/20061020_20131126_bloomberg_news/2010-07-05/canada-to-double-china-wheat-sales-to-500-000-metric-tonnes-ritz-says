             Canada and China signed an agreement
to raise sales of Canadian wheat to the Asian country to 500,000
metric tonnes a year, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said in a
statement today.  
 The memorandum of agreement between the Canadian Wheat
Board and COFCO, China’s largest government food processor, will
about double the value of wheat sales to C$130 million ($122
million) by the end of 2011, according to the statement released
by Canada’s department of agriculture.
