             Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu may offer to President Barack Obama during their 
White House meeting this week to partially extend a building 
freeze on West Bank settlements, the Jerusalem Post said, 
without saying how it obtained the information.  
 If Obama would hint at U.S. acceptance of ultimate Israeli 
control over large settlement blocs, as George W. Bush had done
in a 2004 letter, than Netanyahu would indicate that he will 
freeze construction in the West Bank outside those areas, the 
Post said.
