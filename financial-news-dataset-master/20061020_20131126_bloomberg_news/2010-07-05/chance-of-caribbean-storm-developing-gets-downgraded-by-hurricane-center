             The potential for a weather system
that’s causing thunderstorms and gusty winds over parts of the
western Caribbean to develop into a tropical storm was
downgraded  today  by the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  
 The latest advisory from the Miami-based center said there
was a 30 percent possibility for the system moving west-
northwest near the northern Yucatan Peninsula to become a
tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours compared with 40 percent
in an earlier statement.  
 “Locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds are possible over
portions of the Yucatan today,” the advisory said. Alex, the
first hurricane of the Atlantic season that runs from June
through November, broke up over land last week after coming
ashore south of the Texas-Mexico border.  
 A small low-pressure area packing locally heavy showers
continues to move inland over southern Louisiana and has a near-
zero chance of becoming a tropical cyclone, the center said. No
tropical cyclone formation is expected during the next 48 hours,
it also said.  
 Alex peaked June 30 as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of
100 miles per hour. Its formation as the storm moved through the
Gulf of Mexico caused high waves and swells that stalled London-
based BP Plc’s efforts to halt the worst U.S. oil spill.
