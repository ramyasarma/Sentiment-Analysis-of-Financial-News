             Fortis Healthcare Ltd. , India’s
second-biggest hospital operator, is in talks with banks on a
loan to part-fund its bid for the rest of Singapore’s Parkway
Holdings Ltd., two people familiar with the matter said today.  
 Fortis, based in New Delhi, is holding preliminary
discussions with State Bank of India, IDBI Bank Ltd. and Axis
Bank Ltd. on a bridge loan maturing in six to 12 months, said
the people, who declined to be identified as talks are private.  
 The company, run by billionaire brothers Malvinder and
Shivinder Singh, offered about S$3.2 billion ($2.3 billion) for
the 75 percent of Parkway it doesn’t already own, topping a
takeover offer by Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund for Asia’s
largest hospital operator.
