             Japan’s governing coalition may lose
its majority in the July 11 upper house election, the Sankei
newspaper reported, citing a telephone survey taken July 3-4.   
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s Democratic Party of Japan may
struggle to retain its 54 seats, while People’s New Party, the
junior coalition partner, may win only one seat.  
 The survey also shows that Prime Minister Naoto Kan has an
approval rating of 43.6 percent, down 10.7 percentage points
from June 19-20, the newspaper said.
