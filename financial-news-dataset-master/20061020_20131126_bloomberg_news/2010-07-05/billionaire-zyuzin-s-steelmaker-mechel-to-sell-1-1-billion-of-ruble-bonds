             OAO Mechel, Russian billionaire Igor
Zyuzin’s coal and steel producer, plans to sell as much as 35
billion rubles ($1.1 billion) of domestic bonds, said Alexander
Tolkach, Mechel’s head of investor relations, by phone today.  
 Mechel is seeking funding to develop Siberia’s Elga
deposit, Russia’s largest untapped reserve of coal used in
making steel.
