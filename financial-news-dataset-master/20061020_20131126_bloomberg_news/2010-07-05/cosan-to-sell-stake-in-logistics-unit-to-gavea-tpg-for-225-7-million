             Cosan SA Industria & Comercio , the
world’s largest sugar-cane processor, said it agreed to sell a
stake in its logistics unit to TPG Capital and Gavea
Investimentos Ltda for 400 million reais ($225.7 million).  
 Private equity fund TPG, based in Fort Worth, Texas, and
Gavea, the private equity firm founded by former Brazilian
Central Bank President  Arminio Fraga , will each own 12.5 percent
of Rumo Logistica SA, Cosan said today in a regulatory filing.  
 TPG and Gavea may swap the stakes for Cosan stock if Rumo
doesn’t sell shares within three years after the conclusion of
the deal, Barra Bonita, Brazil-based Cosan said. The companies
would have the right to 13.3 million Cosan shares.  
 Rumo Logistica SA  transports sugar and ethanol by rail and
truck to ports in Brazil. It owns the world’s biggest sugar
export terminal in Santos, Brazil, according to its website.
