             Gold may decline in London, extending
a second weekly drop, as a stronger dollar curbs demand for the
metal as an alternative investment.  
 The dollar gained for the first time in four days against
the euro. Gold last week slid the most since the week ended May
21 after trading on June 28 within 0.2 percent of a record. UBS
AG’s physical bullion sales to India on July 2 were the most
since early January, analyst  Edel Tully  said. The South Asian
nation is the world’s biggest gold consumer.  
 A strengthening dollar “is one reason” for bullion to
slip, said  Dan Smith , an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in
London. “I think gold is just consolidating after recent heavy
losses.”  
 Gold for immediate delivery lost $4.85, or 0.4 percent, to
$1,206.75 an ounce at 4:40 p.m. in London. Prices dropped 3.5
percent last week. The metal for August delivery was little
changed at $1,207.20 in electronic trading on the Comex in New
York.  
 Floor trading on Comex is closed today because of the U.S.
Independence Day holiday. Gold was little changed at $1,208 an
ounce in the afternoon “fixing” in London, used by some mining
companies to sell output, from $1,208.50 at today’s morning
fixing.  
 Bullion prices typically move inversely to the U.S.
currency. A stronger greenback makes purchasing gold in other
currencies more expensive.  
 Slumping Equities  
 The metal has climbed 10 percent this year, reaching a
record $1,265.30 an ounce on June 21, as investors sought to
protect their wealth from prolonged financial turbulence in
Europe and on concern the global recovery may slow. The MSCI
World Index of equities slumped 4 percent last week and has
dropped 12 percent in 2010.  
 Growth in Europe’s services and manufacturing industries
slowed for a second month in June, London-based Markit Economics
said today.  
 Reports last week showed manufacturing in China and the
U.S. slowed in June, while U.S. employment fell last month for
the first time this year and Moody’s Investors Service said June
30 it may cut Spain’s top credit rating. U.S.  service industries 
probably expanded at a slower pace in June, economists said
before a report this week.  
 “The economic outlook remains murky,” said  Hwang Il Doo ,
a Seoul-based trader with KEB Futures Co. “Gold has held out
above $1,200 an ounce even in a correction mode, which sends a
signal to me that it retains the strength to climb.”  
 SPDR Holdings  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, fell for a second day, declining 0.3
metric tons to 1,318.91 tons on July 2, according to the
company’s website. Global holdings of the metal by ETFs added
0.7 tons to 2,067.6 tons on July 2, according to  Bloomberg data 
from 10 providers.  
 Physical gold-buying gained as prices dipped below $1,200
an ounce, UBS’s Tully said today in a report. The metal declined
to an intraday low of $1,198.73 on July 2.  
 “We expect to see Indian buying reassert itself, for
India’s buyers have been all but removed from the market in
recent weeks,” said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor
of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter. Buyers “shall
likely look upon the recent break as an opportunity to own more,
not less physical gold.”  
 Silver for immediate delivery in London was 0.7 percent
lower at $17.74 an ounce. Platinum was 0.3 percent higher at
$1,506.50 an ounce, and palladium was down 0.6 percent at
$429.85 an ounce.  
 China’s passenger-car purchases in June rose 10.9 percent
from a year earlier, down from May’s 25 percent gain, the China
Automotive Technology & Research Center said today. Platinum and
palladium are used in pollution-control devices in cars.
