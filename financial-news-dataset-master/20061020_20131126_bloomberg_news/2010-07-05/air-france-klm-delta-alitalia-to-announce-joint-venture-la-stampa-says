             Air France KLM Group, Delta Air Lines
Inc., and Alitalia SpA today will sign a 10-year commercial
accord that will include cost- and revenue-sharing on routes
between North American and Europe, la Stampa newspaper reported
without citing anyone.  
 The three companies last week announced a press conference
for 11:30 a.m today in Rome. The chief executive officers of the
three companies are scheduled to attend the presser.  
 The agreement creates a network of 200 daily international
flights between 10 hubs and 50,000 passengers per day, la Stampa
said. Costs, revenue, and profit or losses will be shared on the
North American-European routes, the newspaper said.
