             The euro may struggle to extend last
week’s gains, fueled by the “better-than-feared” European
Central Bank tenders, which prompted investors to end bets the
currency would fall, according to RBC Capital Markets.  
 “We remain bearish,”  Sue Trinh , a senior foreign-exchange
strategist in Hong Kong, wrote today in a report. The tenders
“morphed into wholesale short covering from macro and model
accounts on euro-dollar, euro-Canadian dollar and euro-
Australian dollar” she said. “With much of this bottling
behind us and positioning better balanced, we expect further
gains will be harder fought.”  
 The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2542 as of 7:23 a.m. in
London.
