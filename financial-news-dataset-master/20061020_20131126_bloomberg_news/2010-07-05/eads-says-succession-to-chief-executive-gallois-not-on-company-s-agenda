             European Aeronautic Defence & Space
Co. ’s succession plan for Chief Executive Officer  Louis Gallois 
isn’t on the agenda of the manufacturer or at shareholder
 Daimler AG , the companies said.  
 A report in La Tribune newspaper that Daimler Chief
Financial Officer  Bodo Uebber  may replace Gallois in 2012 “is
purely speculative and lacks any foundation,”  Florian Martens ,
spokesman at the Stuttgart, Germany-based luxury-car maker said
today by telephone.     Any speculation on a successor to 
Gallois is “totally unfounded,” an official at EADS said in 
an e-mail.  
 Uebber is also chairman of the board of Paris- and Munich-
based  EADS , the parent company of planemaker Airbus SAS.  Daimler 
owns 15 percent of EADS and controls the votes of another 7.5
percent held by other German shareholders. France’s government
and Paris-based publisher Lagardere SCA together have a matching
22.5 percent stake. Gallois’s five-year term  expires  in 2012,
according to the company’s website.
