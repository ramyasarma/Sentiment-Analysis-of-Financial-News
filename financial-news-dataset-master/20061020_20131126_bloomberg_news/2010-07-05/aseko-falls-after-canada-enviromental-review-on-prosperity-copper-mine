             Taseko Mines Ltd. fell in Toronto in
the first trading day after a Canadian government panel said the
company’s proposed Prosperity gold and copper mine in northern
British Columbia would cause “significant adverse environmental
effects.’’  
 The shares plunged 46 cents, or 11 percent, to C$3.70 at
9:42 a.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
