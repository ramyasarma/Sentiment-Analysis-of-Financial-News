             China may be the world’s biggest
initial public offering market this year as companies are likely
to raise 500 billion yuan ($74 billion) in Shanghai and Shenzhen,
PricewaterhouseCoopers said in Shanghai today.  
 China will see 300 new listings in 2010, up from 99 last
year, according to a statement from PwC. Two overseas companies
and one red-chip firm, or company controlled by Chinese holders
and listed abroad, will debut on Shanghai’s international board
as early as the second half, said Frank Lyn, China markets
leader for PwC, without naming the companies.  
 Companies have raised 208.4 billion yuan from 171 IPOs in
China this year, setting the market to surpass funds collected
in each of the previous two years, according to Bloomberg data.
China’s securities regulator allowed share sales to resume in
June 2009 after a 10-month moratorium imposed to curb stock
market volatility during the global financial crisis.  
 Haitong Securites Co. took the lead in managing domestic
IPOs this year, followed by Ping An Securities Co., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Industrial and basic materials
companies were the biggest first-time sellers of stock in China
this year in terms of the number of deals and funds raised, the
data show.  
 Investment banking fee income more than doubled to $2.3
billion in China and Hong Kong in the first half from the same
period a year earlier, according to a report by New York-based
research firm Freeman & Co. last week.
