             Mexico’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to a record low, on speculation a report will show that
inflation fell within the central bank’s target range for a
second time this year.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.16 percent at
5 p.m. today, according to Banco Santander SA. That was the
lowest yield since the security was issued in 2005. The price of
the security gained 0.72 centavo to 125.47 centavos per peso.
The yields have plunged 111 basis points this year.  
 “The market is waiting for inflation to continue
converging with the central bank’s target range,” said  Jorge Perez-Duarte , a managing director for emerging markets at TD
Securities Inc. in Toronto. “The bonds have had a great rally,
there isn’t much more room for them to fall.”  
 Annual inflation slowed to 3.74 percent in June, according
to the median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the
second time since December that inflation fell within the bank’s
target range. The central bank reports the data July 8 and has a
target range between 2 percent and 4 percent.  
 The currency rose 0.2 percent to 13.0624 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 13.0828 on July 2.
