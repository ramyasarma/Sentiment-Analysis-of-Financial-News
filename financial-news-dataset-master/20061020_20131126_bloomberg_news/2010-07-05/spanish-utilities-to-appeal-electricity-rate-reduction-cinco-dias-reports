             Spanish power companies plan to
appeal the government’s decision to reduce the electricity rates
paid by consumers,  Cinco Dias  reported, without saying who
provided the information.  
 The companies plan to file appeals to the National Court on
an individual basis and possibly through industry association
Unesa, which represents Iberdrola SA, Endesa SA and the Spanish
units of EDP-Energias de Portugal SA and Germany’s E.ON AG, the
newspaper said.  
 The companies are disputing the government’s decision to
lower the price by 3 percent for “access” to power, one of two
main components in the rate paid by households and businesses,
the newspaper said. The price change was effective July 1.
