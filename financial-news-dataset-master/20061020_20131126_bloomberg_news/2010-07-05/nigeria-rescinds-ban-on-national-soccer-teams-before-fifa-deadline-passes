             Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan 
rescinded his decision to ban the country’s soccer teams from
competition for two years after FIFA said government meddling
may result in its national federation being suspended.  
 Jonathan took the decision last week after the Nigerian
men’s team, known as the Super Eagles, was knocked out of the
World Cup in the first round.  
 “The ban has just been lifted by the president,” Ademola
Olajire, spokesman for the Nigeria Football Federation, said in
an interview today. “The board of the NEF meets tomorrow by
which time there will be further comments.”  
 Soccer’s governing body, which had set a deadline of 6 p.m.
Nigerian time today for the ban to be lifted, said it had
received a letter from the Nigerian government confirming that
it “revokes its decision to withdraw Nigeria’s participation.”  
 “The letter was received by FIFA before the deadline set
last Friday July 2, and follows mediation talks between FIFA
executive committee member Dr.  Amos Adamu  and the Nigerian
government,” FIFA said in an e-mailed statement. “Therefore,
the NFF remains vested with all its statutory rights.”
