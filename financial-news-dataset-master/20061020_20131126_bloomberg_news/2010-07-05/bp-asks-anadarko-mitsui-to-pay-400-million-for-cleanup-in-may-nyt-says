             BP Plc last month asked Anadarko 
Petroleum Corp. and Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. of Japan, its 
partners in the Gulf of Mexico oil well that spilled, to pay 
almost $400 million out of about $1 billion in cleanup costs 
for the well in May, the New York Times reported.  
 The demand on June 2, disclosed in recently released 
documents, showed that BP asked Anadarko for $272 million and 
Mitsui for $111 million, the Times said.   
 BP owns 65 percent of the well, Anadarko 25 percent and 
Mitsui 10 percent, the newspaper said.
