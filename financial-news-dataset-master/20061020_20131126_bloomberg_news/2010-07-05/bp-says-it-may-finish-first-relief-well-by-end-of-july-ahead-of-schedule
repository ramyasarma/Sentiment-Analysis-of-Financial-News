             BP Plc , fighting a damaged well
spewing as much as 60,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of
Mexico, said it may complete a relief well that will help plug
the leak ahead of schedule.  
 “There is a possibility that the first relief well could
be completed by the end of July” spokesman Mark Proegler said
by telephone from New Orleans today. “It’s more likely that it
would be some time in August.”  
 BP’s cost of responding to the worst oil spill in U.S.
history rose to $3.1 billion, the company said in a press
release today. Two relief wells are the only solutions BP
currently has to stop the flow after an attempt to plug the well
with mud failed.  
 BP is ahead of schedule with drilling the wells and may
complete one of them this month if weather conditions permit,
 Bob Dudley , chief executive officer of BP’s Gulf Coast
Restoration Organization, told the Houston Chronicle on July 3.  
 The company previously said it will finish the first well
in August.  
 “The sooner the better,”  Bertrand Hodee , an analyst at
Kepler Capital Markets in Paris, said by phone today. Hodee
rates BP “buy” and doesn’t own any shares.
