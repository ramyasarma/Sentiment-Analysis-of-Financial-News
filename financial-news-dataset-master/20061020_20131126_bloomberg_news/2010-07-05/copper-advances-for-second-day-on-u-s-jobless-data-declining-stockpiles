             Copper advanced for a second day as a
decline in U.S. unemployment and a drop in stockpiles to the
lowest in seven months boosted confidence in the global economic
recovery.  
 Three-month delivery copper climbed as much as 2.5 percent
to $6,568 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded
at $6,531 at 4:05 p.m. in Tokyo. The contract lost 5.3 percent
last week. Aluminum increased 0.9 percent to $1,954.50 a ton
today and zinc jumped 3.1 percent to $1,835.  
 The U.S. jobless rate dropped to 9.5 percent in June from
9.7 percent the prior month, the Labor Department said July 2.
Stockpiles of copper tracked by the LME declined for an 11th day
on July 2 to 447,300 tons, the lowest level since Dec. 4.  
 “Copper is supported a bit by the positive job data from
the U.S. and a drop in stockpiles” at London Metal Exchange
warehouses, said  Hironobu Yamamura , a trader at Sumitomo Corp.’s
commodity business department.  
 Bookings to remove metal from warehouses, or so-called
canceled warrants, touched 35,425 tons on July 1, the highest
level since March 3. Of the total, those in South Korea climbed
to 14,550 tons, the highest level since March 11, 2009. They
have since eased 1.2 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively.  
 The recent increase of canceled warrants at LME warehouses
in South Korea reflects tight supplies in East Asia, including
China, the world’s biggest consumer of the industrial metal,
Yamamura said.  
 Copper also gained on speculation that last week’s price
drop and a rebound in equities lured investors, Yamamura said.
Prices may stay in a range between $6,200 and $6,800, he said.  
 U.S. markets are closed today for the Independence Day
holiday. Trading may be “relatively quiet” due to lower
liquidity, Yamamura said.  
 Shanghai Gains  
 Copper for October delivery gained as much as 0.8 percent
at 52,610 yuan ($7,770) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
and closed at 52,260 yuan. Shanghai aluminum climbed 0.2 percent
to 14,810 yuan and zinc rose 0.8 percent to 15,230 yuan.  
 “A halt in the decline of equities lends support to metal
prices,” Zeng Chao, an analyst at Everbright Futures Co., said
from Shanghai. “Equities and metals haven’t really shaken off
pressure from bearish economic data.”  
 Lead for three-month delivery in London added 1.4 percent
to $1,778 a ton, nickel advanced 1.9 percent to $19,150 a ton
and tin climbed 0.4 percent to $17,300 a ton.
