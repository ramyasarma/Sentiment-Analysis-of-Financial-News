             John Lewis Partnership Plc, the owner
of the U.K. department-store chain and Waitrose supermarkets, is
offering to repurchase as much as 150 million pounds ($227
million) of notes.  
 The retailer plans buy back the 6.375 bonds at a price
equivalent to a yield of 140 basis points more than U.K.
government bonds due 2012, according to a regulatory filing.
There are 300 million pounds of the notes outstanding that were
issued through its John Lewis Plc unit, which is also carrying
out the buyback.  
 New pound-denominated securities will also be issued to
lengthen the maturity of its debt, the London-based company
said.  
 Investors can tender the notes not later than 5 p.m. in
London on July 14, the company said. Barclays Bank Plc and HSBC
Holdings Plc are managing the transaction.  
 The bonds rose 1 percentage point to 106 percent of face
value, equivalent to a yield of 2.32 percent, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg at 11:07 a.m. in London.
