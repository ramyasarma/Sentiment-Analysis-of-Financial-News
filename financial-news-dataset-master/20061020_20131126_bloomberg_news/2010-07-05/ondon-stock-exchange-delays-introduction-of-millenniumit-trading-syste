             London Stock Exchange Group Plc ,
Europe’s oldest independent bourse, delayed the introduction of
a new trading system to October to aid clients working to comply
with NYSE Euronext’s move to a new data center.  
 LSE, which had planned to start shifting U.K. equities to
its MillenniumIT trading system in September, will now begin
moving its Turquoise unit on Oct. 4 and its main market from
Nov. 1, according to a notice to clients.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Xavier Rolet  bought Colombo, Sri
Lanka-based MillenniumIT last year to overhaul LSE’s technology
and compete better with alternative trading systems including
Bats Europe and Chi-X Europe Ltd., which offer faster trading
and lower prices. Millennium will replace LSE’s current
TradElect system.  
 LSE’s third-quarter information and technology services
sales rose 2.6 percent to 55.4 million pounds ($88.4 million),
with MillenniumIT contributing for the first time, the exchange
said Jan. 21.
