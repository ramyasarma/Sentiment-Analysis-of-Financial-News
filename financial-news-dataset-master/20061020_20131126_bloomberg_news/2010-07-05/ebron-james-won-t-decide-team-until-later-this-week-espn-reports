             LeBron James won’t decide which
National Basketball Association team he’ll sign with until after
his basketball camp this week, ESPN reported without saying
where it got the information.  
 James, 25, is hosting many of the nation’s top high school
and college players at his Nike camp at the University of Akron
in Ohio through July 7.   
 A two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, James is the top free
agent available this offseason after playing his first seven
seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He had meetings over the
weekend with the Cavaliers, the New York Knicks, Chicago Bulls,
New Jersey Nets, Miami Heat and Los Angeles Clippers.   
 The Knicks had a second meeting with James’s agent, Leon
Rose, to clarify the team’s salary cap situation for the next
two seasons, ESPN said, citing Knicks President of Basketball
Operations Donnie Walsh. The Cavaliers can offer James about $30
million more than other teams on a maximum-length contract.
