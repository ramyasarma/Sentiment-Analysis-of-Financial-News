             Brazil’s Central Bank President
 Henrique Meirelles  said the loans provided by the state
development bank may push the benchmark lending rate a little
higher, Valor Economico reported.  
 The fixed-rate loans by the bank known as BNDES reduce the
efficiency of monetary policy, Meirelles told the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper in an interview.  
 Meirelles said that the global crisis will likely
contribute to easing inflation in Brazil and that measures taken
by the central bank will also be important to avoid higher
consumer prices.
