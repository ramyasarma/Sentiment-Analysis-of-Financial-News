             Latvia’s  central bank  sold 9.2
million lati ($16.3 million) for euros last week, the Riga-based
bank said today on its  website .  
 Latvia, like neighboring Lithuania and Estonia, is a member
of the pre-euro exchange-rate mechanism and pegs the lats to the
bloc’s common currency. Latvia keeps the exchange rate within a
1 percent band around a target.
