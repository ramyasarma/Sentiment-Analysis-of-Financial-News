             Prudential Plc , which last month
abandoned its $35.5 billion bid for AIA Group Ltd., is being
spurned by Asian investors in its Hong Kong and Singapore
listings, share trading data show.  
 About 126,500 shares are  traded  daily on average in Hong
Kong and 53,000 shares  change  hands each day in Singapore,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The daily trading
average in the insurer’s primary London listing is 13.4 million.  
 “It’s probably an indication that Pru has got a big job to
get interest in the shares now that the AIA bid has fallen
through,” said  John Smith , who helps manage 2 billion pounds
($3 billion) including Prudential shares at Brown Shipley & Co.
in Manchester, England.  
 Prudential set up the Asian listings in May in anticipation
of increased demand for its stock from investors in the region
once it completed its purchase of  American International Group
Inc. ’s main Asian unit. The takeover, which would have been the
biggest in the world this year, collapsed after top 10 investors
including Blackrock Inc. and Fidelity Investments said the deal
was too costly.  
 Prudential spokesman  Ed Brewster  didn’t immediately respond
to a request seeking comment.  
 The insurer  dropped  3 pence, or 0.6 percent, to 491.1 pence
at 9:55 a.m. in London trading, valuing the firm at 12.5 billion
pounds. The stock has fallen 15.2 percent in the last two weeks.  
 About 3.5 million shares have been traded in Hong Kong
since it first sold shares on the bourse on May 25 and about 1.5
million have been traded in Singapore. More than 12.2 million
Prudential shares were traded in London on July 2.
