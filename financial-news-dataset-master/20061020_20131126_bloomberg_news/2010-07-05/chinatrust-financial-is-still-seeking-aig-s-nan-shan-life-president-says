             Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. is
seeking to renew its bid to purchase the Taiwan-based life-
insurance operations of  American International Group Inc.   
 Primus Financial Holdings Ltd. and China  Strategic Holdings
Ltd. , both based in Hong Kong, are awaiting approval from Taiwan
for their proposed purchase of  Nan Shan Life Insurance Co.  from
AIG for $2.15 billion. Regulators and legislators in Taiwan are
concerned that the buyers, who set up Primus-Nanshan Holding (UK)
Co. for the transaction, are backed by funding from China.  
 “Since regulators have not approved China Strategic’s bid
for Nan Shan, Chinatrust is eager to renew its offer for the
life-insurance subsidiary in the best interest of AIG
shareholders, including U.S. taxpayers,”  Daniel Wu ,
Chinatrust’s president, said in an e-mailed statement.  
 AIG, which is selling assets to repay a $182.3 billion U.S.
rescue, reached an agreement with the buyer group in June to
extend the deadline for the sale to Oct. 12 from July 12.  Mark Herr , an AIG spokesman, declined to comment on the matter.  
 Chinatrust, Taiwan’s third-biggest financial company by
market value, had planned to partner in an eventual sale. The
company said in November it would pay $600 million to China
Strategic for a 30 percent stake in Nan Shan. China Strategic
would buy 1.17 billion Chinatrust shares, or a 9.95 percent
stake, for about NT$20.8 billion ($648 million) as part of the
deal, Chinatrust said at the time.
