Research strategists cut a 2010-end price estimate for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index to 275, they wrote in a report today, citing
downgrades to U.S. economic growth forecasts.  
 The strategists reduced their 2011 per-share profit growth
prediction to “sub-10 percent” from 20 percent previously,
they wrote.
