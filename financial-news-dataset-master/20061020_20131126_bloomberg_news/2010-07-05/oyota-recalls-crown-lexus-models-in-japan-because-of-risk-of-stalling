             Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s
largest automaker, will recall Lexus cars sold in Japan and in
China after saying engines in as many as 270,000 vehicles
worldwide may have a defect that can lead to stalling.  
 The company will recall 91,903 Lexus GS 350, GS 450h, GS
460, IS 350, LS 460, LS 600h and LS 600hL models and some Toyota
Crown cars in Japan because of problems with valves that may
cause the engine to stall, according to a statement on the
website of the nation’s Transportation Ministry today.  
 Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, is working to
restore its reputation for quality after  recalling  about 8
million vehicles globally for defects linked to unintended
acceleration. The company recalled about 13,000 Lexus GX 460
sport-utility vehicles in April after Consumer Reports labeled
the model a “safety risk” because it could roll over. The
designation was removed in May.  
 The recall in Japan covers cars built between July 2005 and
August 2008. The automaker will notify U.S. regulators of the
recall next week, Toyota said on July 2. About 138,000 vehicles
in the U.S. may have engine problems that may include stalling
while the vehicle is moving, according to the company.  
 China Recall  
 In China, the company will recall 5,791 LS 460, LS 460L,
and LS 600hL imported models from July 17, according to a
statement on China’s General Administration of Quality
Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine’s  website .  
 The latest recall may cost the carmaker 20 billion yen
($228 million), the Asahi newspaper reported last week. Toyota
spokeswoman  Ririko Takeuchi  declined to comment on the potential
cost.  
 The engine problem may result from “contaminated materials
used in valve springs,”  Mark Templin , U.S. group vice president
and general manager of the Lexus brand, said July 1 on a
conference call.  
 The Toyota City, Japan-based company, which paid a record
U.S. fine of $16.4 million this year for not complying with
auto-safety regulations, said on June 25 it would recall the
Lexus HS 250h sedan after too much gasoline spilled in U.S.
government crash tests, posing a fire risk.
