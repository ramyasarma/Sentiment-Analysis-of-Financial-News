             The U.S. continues to “speak out”
against Russia’s “occupation” of two Georgian regions,
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in the Georgian capital
Tbilisi today.  
 Georgia should avoid being “baited or provoked” by
Russia, Clinton told leaders of Georgian women’s organizations.
Instead, Georgia should concentrate on economic development and
democracy building, she said. “That is the rebuke no one can
dispute.”
