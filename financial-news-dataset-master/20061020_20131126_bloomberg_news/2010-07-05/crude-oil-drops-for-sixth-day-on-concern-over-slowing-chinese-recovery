             Crude oil dropped for a sixth day in
New York on concern that the pace of economic recovery is
slowing in Europe and China, stalling a rebound in fuel demand.  
 Oil fell below $72 a barrel as the China Automotive
Technology & Research Center said car sales expanded at a slower
pace in June. European stocks declined for a fifth day, the
longest losing streak in a year, as a report showed growth slid
in the region’s services and manufacturing industries.  
 “Crude has come under a bit of pressure because of worries
about the global economy,” said  Peter McGuire , managing
director of CWA Global Markets Pty in Sydney. “Sentiment is
negative. Looking at mature markets, it’s pretty bleak. Europe
is looking terrible.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery dropped as much as $1.05, or
1.5 percent, to $71.09 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $71.63 at 11:48 a.m.
Singapore time. Floor trading was closed yesterday on the Nymex
for the U.S. Independence Day holiday and electronic trades are
booked into today’s for settlement purposes.  
 The market is in its longest pullback since a six-day drop
through May 18. Crude oil has declined 10 percent this year.  
 Prices also fell as a Chinese services-industry index slid
to a 15-month low, adding to signs that the economy leading the
world recovery is cooling. The measure fell to 55.6 from 56.4,
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said yesterday.  
 Recent Rally ‘Vulnerable’  
 “Right now, it does look like crude oil has not only
broken down at $82, the recent rally above $76 was vulnerable,”
said  Thomas Schroeder , managing director at Chart Partners Group
Ltd. in a Bloomberg Television interview from Bangkok. “That’s
a sell level for me.”  
 Brent crude oil for August settlement dropped as much as 70
cents, or 1 percent, to $70.77 a barrel on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London, and was at $71.30 at 11:47 a.m. in
Singapore. Yesterday, the contract fell 0.3 percent to $71.47.  
 In Europe, a  composite index  based on a survey of euro-area
purchasing managers in the services and manufacturing industries
dropped to 56 in June from 56.4 in May, Markit Economics said.
