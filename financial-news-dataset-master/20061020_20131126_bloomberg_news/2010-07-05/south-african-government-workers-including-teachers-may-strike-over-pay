             South African government workers
including teachers and nurses may strike over a pay dispute, the
Congress of South African Trade Unions and the Independent
Labour Caucus said in a joint statement.  
 Workers are demanding an 8.6 percent increase, while the
government is offering 6.5 percent, said the organizations,
which represent a combined 1.3 million workers. A strike would
start in two weeks, after the end of the soccer World Cup,
according to the statement.  
 “The plight of our members is desperate and we are left
with no other options but to also consider the most severe
option left to us, which is strike action,” the organizations
said today. “Failure to find an amicable solution will have
serious consequences for the public service.”  
 Employees of state-owned logistics company Transnet Ltd.
set a precedent in May by winning an 11 percent wage increase
after an 18-day strike that crippled the country’s exports.
State-owned power utility Eskom Holdings Ltd. yesterday offered
workers a 9 percent increase, almost double the country’s May
inflation rate of 4.6 percent.
