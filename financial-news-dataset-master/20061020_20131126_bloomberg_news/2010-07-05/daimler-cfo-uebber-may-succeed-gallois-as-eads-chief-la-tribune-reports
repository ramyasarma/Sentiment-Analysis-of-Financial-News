             Daimler AG  Chief Financial Officer
 Bodo Uebber  may succeed  Louis Gallois  as chief executive officer
of  European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.  when the Frenchman’s
tenure ends in 2012,  La Tribune  said today, citing unidentified
people at the aerospace company.  
 Under an accord between the French and German governments,
Daimler will name a German to lead EADS in 2012 while the French
will choose a replacement for  Tom Enders  as head of EADS’s
Airbus unit, the French newspaper reported. Enders would leave
should Uebber, chairman of the  EADS  board, be selected over him,
La Tribune said.
