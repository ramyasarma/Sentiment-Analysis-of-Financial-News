             The best men’s soccer player in the
world will be recognized by a single accolade after FIFA and
France Football magazine decided to combine their awards.  
 FIFA’s World Player of the Year and the magazine’s Ballon
d’Or will be united into one -- called the FIFA Ballon d’Or, or
Golden Ball. The first winner will be named Jan. 10 in Zurich,
FIFA President  Sepp Blatter  said today in Johannesburg.  
 “The winner is football because as of January of next year
we will have one single trophy for the best player in the world
and this will be the Golden Ball,” Blatter said at a news
conference.  
 The winner of the first FIFA Ballon d’Or will be chosen by
coaches and captains of national teams and journalists, soccer’s
governing body said.  
 The Ballon d’Or, at one time limited to European players,
has been awarded since 1956, while FIFA’s accolade began in
1991. Barcelona and Argentina forward  Lionel Messi  currently
holds both honors.  
 Messi, who plays for Spanish club Barcelona, is the 4-1
joint-favorite to be the first recipient of the new award along
with  Wesley Sneijder , according to U.K. bookmaker William Hill.  
 Netherlands midfielder Sneijder has scored four goals at
the World Cup to lift his country into the semifinals and also
helped Inter Milan win Europe’s Champions League last season.  
 France’s  Zinedine Zidane  and Brazil’s  Ronaldo  each won the
FIFA award three times.  Michel Platini , now president of
European soccer’s governing body UEFA, won the Ballon d’Or in
three straight years through 1985.
