             Peter Douglas  will step down as
Asia’s representative to the Alternative Investment Management
Association, the hedge-fund industry’s largest trade group.  
 Douglas, 49, will resign as the group’s elected council
member for the Asia-Pacific region at AIMA’s annual general
meeting on Sept. 23, he said in an e-mail to the group’s members,
which he confirmed by phone today.  
 Douglas, who founded Singapore-based hedge fund consultancy
firm GFIA Pte in 1998, has been involved with  AIMA  for more than
10 years, according to the e-mail. He has been the group’s first
regional council member for the last two years, after having
previously led the Singapore chapter.  
 “I’m resigning to let fresh blood, and fresh ideas, take
over,” he said in the e-mail.  
 Douglas seconded the nomination of  Michael Coleman , the
Singapore-based managing director of Aisling Analytics Pte, to
replace him, according to the e-mail. Aisling Analytics manages
the $1.1 billion  Merchant Commodity Fund . Coleman is also the
chairman of AIMA’s Singapore branch.  
 “Having started Aisling as a tiny boutique that remained
tiny for several years, he understands the concerns of the
overwhelming majority of our community that are small managers,
who struggle to raise and maintain assets in today’s
environment,” Douglas said.  
 Douglas, whose firm advises investors seeking to allocate
money to hedge funds, started a wealth management business in
January to tap mainly affluent individuals in Asia.
