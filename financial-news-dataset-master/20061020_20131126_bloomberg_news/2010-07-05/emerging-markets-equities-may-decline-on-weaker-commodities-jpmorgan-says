             A decline in commodity prices is
likely to drive emerging-market stocks lower in the third
quarter, offering investors an “extraordinary buying
opportunity,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  
 The “markers” of a correction in emerging-market stocks
will be “large redemptions” in commodity funds and a slump in
crude oil prices below the May low of $65 a barrel, analysts led
by  Adrian Mowat  said in a July 4 report. This may occur this
quarter, the analysts predicted.  
 The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  has dropped 7.5 percent
this year amid concern Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and
China’s efforts to curb property speculation will hurt a global
economic recovery. Measures tracking energy and materials stocks
make up two of the index’s three worst-performing industry
groups, falling 14 percent and 10 percent, respectively.  
 “For now markets are going lower driven by a sharp
correction in commodities,” Mowat, JPMorgan’s chief Asian and
emerging-markets strategist, wrote in the report. “The third
quarter of 2010 should provide an exceptional buying
opportunity.”  
 The  Baltic Dry Index , a measure of shipping costs for bulk
commodities, has dropped 46 percent in 26 straight sessions, the
longest losing streak since August 2005. Crude oil prices have
declined 8.9 percent since the start of the year, while copper
has tumbled 12 percent this year.  
 The MSCI Emerging Markets gauge added 0.1 percent as of
10:12 a.m. in Singapore.  
 ‘Wait’ to Buy  
 JPMorgan said investors should “wait” before adding to
technology and transportation shares as well as stocks in India,
 South Korea , Taiwan and  the Philippines . Still, investors are
“too pessimistic” on global growth, according to the report.  
 Stocks fell last week after U.S. government data showed
manufacturing expanded in June at the slowest pace this year and
private employers added fewer workers to payrolls than forecast
last month. China’s manufacturing also expanded at a slower pace
for a second month in June, adding to signs that growth in the
world’s third-largest economy is moderating.  
 “Global growth is forecast to be lower than the average
post-recession period, but it is growth,” Mowat wrote. “In our
view, we are moving into a period of outperformance for growth
stocks. This is good for emerging-market equities.”
