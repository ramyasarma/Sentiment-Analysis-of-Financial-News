             Previ President  Ricardo Flores  said
the pension fund for  Banco do Brasil SA  employees plans to boost
investments in retailers and real estate, Folha de S. Paulo
reported.  
 Previ doesn’t plan to sell Vale SA shares, Flores told
Folha newspaper.  
 The fund wants to expand investments in retail to take
advantage of the higher purchase power in the country, Flores
told Folha newspaper. The fund also plans to invest 3 billion
reais ($1.7 billion) by 2016 in real estate projects, Flores
said, according to Folha.  
 Real estate investments will represent 5 percent of the
pension fund’s total investments by 2016, up from 2.8 percent
currently, Folha said. Previ will focus in investments in malls
and commercial buildings, Folha said.
