             Indonesia’s government plans to name
three banks next week to help it sell $650 million of Islamic
bonds in October, a finance ministry official said.  
 “We will pick three names next week,”  Dahlan Siamat ,
director for Islamic financing at the ministry, said in a
telephone interview in Jakarta. Southeast Asia’s largest economy
raised $650 million from selling its first-ever international
Islamic dollar bonds in April last year, a transaction arranged
by Barclays Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc.  
 “The size will be approximately similar to that of last
year,” he said. “That’s the indicative size and it will really
depend on approval from the Minister of Finance and market
demand.”  
 Indonesia has been selling bonds in domestic and
international markets to help finance a budget deficit estimated
at 2.1 percent of gross domestic product this year.
