             Drugmakers are provoking fewer
antitrust concerns in their attempts to keep generic competitors
off the market, a European Union probe into the industry showed.  
 The proportion of “potentially problematic” patent
settlements between branded-drug makers and producers of lower-
priced generic medicines more than halved, compared with the
results of an earlier investigation, the European Commission
said today. The amount of money involved in settlements also
fell.  
 “Our report appears to show the sector’s increased
awareness of the potential competition concerns,” said
 Joaquin Almunia , the EU competition commissioner. “But the
commission will remain attentive to ensure that the sale of
safe, affordable medicines is not delayed by unfair practices.”  
 Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are
focusing on how the settlements might harm consumers. Companies
use a variety of techniques to delay generics “for as long as
possible,” the EU said in a  report  last July. The commission in
January followed up last year’s report with an investigation by
querying companies including  AstraZeneca Plc ,  GlaxoSmithKline
Plc  and  Sanofi-Aventis SA  on all patent settlements made between
July 1, 2008, and Dec. 31, 2009.  
 The earlier probe was started in 2008 by Almunia’s
predecessor  Neelie Kroes  to target unlawful tactics to keep
cheaper copies of drugs off the market. It covered the period
from January 2000 to June 2008.  
 The value of the settlements fell to less than 1 million
euros ($1.25 million) from more than 200 million euros in the
earlier investigation, which covered a longer period of time,
the commission said today.  
 Misled Patent Officials  
 The EU’s top court on July 1 upheld a 2005 decision by the
commission that AstraZeneca misled patent officials and flouted
antitrust rules to keep a generic competitor off the market.  
 The commission said today it would “frown at agreements
that contain restrictions,” explaining that problematic
settlements “are those that limit generic entry and foresee a
value transfer from originator to generic company.”  
 “This is the closest we’ve come so far to a suggestion by
the commission that such agreements are illegal,” Christopher
Thomas, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells in Brussels, said in
a telephone interview. “It gives a greater specificity about
what exactly are problematic patent settlements.”  
 The commission said “not all settlements” in the
problematic category need to be probed immediately for potential
antitrust breaches and that it will assess each case “on its
merits.”  
 While such clarification is useful, it’s also
“frustrating” because it confuses when a potentially
problematic settlement becomes unlawful, said Thomas. “It’s not
enough for companies to know whether they’ll be investigated,
they want to know whether their conduct is lawful or not.”
