             The euro may advance to a two-month
high against the dollar after breaking through the so-called
neckline of an “inverse head-and-shoulders” pattern, according
to Forecast Pte.  
 Europe’s single currency strengthened 1.6 percent last week
to $1.2566, placing it above the neckline at $1.2420, said  Pak Lai Ng , a technical analyst at Forecast in Singapore. An inverse
head and shoulders consists of three troughs with the middle one
being the deepest.  
 “So far the euro is keeping above the neckline break
area,” Ng said in an interview. “The outlook is still on the
positive side.”  
 The euro traded at $1.2540 as of 7:25 a.m. in Tokyo after
advancing to $1.2612 on July 2, the highest level since May 21.
The currency is poised to rally to $1.3120, Ng said, a level
last reached on May 4.  
 The neckline of the inverse head and shoulders connects the
base of the first trough reached on May 21 with that of the
third trough set on June 21, according to Bloomberg data.  
 The euro is also poised to extend gains after completing a
“bullish reversal” of its downtrend that started at the end of
last year, Ng said.  
 The currency’s close last week was above the previous
week’s high of $1.2487, signaling that further gains are now
likely, he said.  
 The euro is poised to climb to resistance levels at the May
21 high of $1.2672, and then at the downtrend line connecting
its December and April highs, which is $1.2767 today, Ng said.  
 Should the currency break these levels, it may then climb
toward the 100-day moving average at $1.2982, he said.
Resistance refers to an area where sell orders may be clustered.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
