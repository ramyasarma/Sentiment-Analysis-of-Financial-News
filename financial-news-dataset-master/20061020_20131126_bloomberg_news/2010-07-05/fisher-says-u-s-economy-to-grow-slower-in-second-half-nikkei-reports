President Richard Fisher said the U.S. economy is likely to grow
more slowly in the second half than it did in the first, Nikkei
English News said, citing an interview. Growth is likely to be
“closer to the low end” of the 2-3 percent range, the report
said, citing Fisher.  
 Unemployment, concerns about financial markets, and
declines in the housing market had hurt consumer spending, the
report said.
