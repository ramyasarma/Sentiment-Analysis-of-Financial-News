             Ukraine customs officers, security
service employees and border guards have seized 582 kilograms of
cocaine, the biggest haul ever in the country.  
 The cocaine was hidden among scrap metal pipes used for
drilling, the Kiev-based State Customs Service said in an e-
mailed statement today. Bohdan Panas, the spokesman of Ukraine’s
southern customs, wasn’t available on his office phone when
called today to clarify the date of the seizure.  
 The scrap metal was being transported to Ukraine from
Bolivia, which led custom officials to hold an additional
inspection. An X-ray didn’t show the narcotics, which were found
after a pipe with two additional layers inside was sliced,
according to the statement.  
 Last week, Ukrainian President  Viktor Yanukovych  called on
law enforcement bodies to take “drastic measures” to tackle
illegal drugs circulation. He gave officials from prosecution
and the health ministry two months to propose legal changes to
protect the country from being “ruined” by drug sales.  
 Another 152 kilograms of the drug was detained in Odessa on
June 30, according to the statement.
