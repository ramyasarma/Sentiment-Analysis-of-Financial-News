             Australian  stock futures  fell as
Europe’s services and manufacturing growth slowed, raising
concern the global economic recovery will falter.  
 Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  dropped 0.3
percent today. The market in the U.S. was closed yesterday for a
holiday. Nikkei 225 stock futures were bid in the pre-market at
9,200 in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. The gauge closed
at 9,266.78 yesterday. New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  declined 0.1
percent in Wellington.  
 “The European market was weak, and investors are looking
for clues for direction,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist
at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo.  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.3 percent yesterday.
Growth in Europe’s  services and manufacturing industries  slowed
for a second month in June, according to London-based Markit
Economics.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has fallen 13 percent from its
high this year on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and
Chinese steps to curb property prices will hurt global growth.
Companies in the measure trade at an average of 13.7 times
estimated profit, compared with 10.9 times for the Stoxx.  
 Daiwa Securities Group Inc. , Japan’s second-largest
brokerage, may be active today after agreeing to buy KBC Groep
NV’s convertible bond unit and its Asia equity derivatives
business for about $1 billion.  
 SK Telecom Co.  may also be active after the company’s
spokeswoman said it is in talks with Apple Inc. to offer the
iPad tablet computer and iPhone in South Korea.
