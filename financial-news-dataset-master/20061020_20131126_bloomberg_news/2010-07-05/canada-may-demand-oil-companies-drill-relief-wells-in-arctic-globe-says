             Canada’s National Energy Board may 
require oil companies to drill a relief well in deepwater 
Arctic exploration projects, the Globe and Mail reported, 
citing chairman Gaetan Caron.  
 The regulator is due to award exploration licenses for the 
Beaufort Sea in an auction that closes next week and needs to 
decide on regulations governing relief wells before companies 
can start drilling, the newspaper said.
