             The euro may extend gains against the
dollar after closing above a key weekly level of $1.2495, Helaba
Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen said, citing trading patterns.  
 Daily momentum indicators such as the moving average
convergence/divergence also signal the euro will gain against
the dollar in the near term, the bank wrote in an e-mailed note.  
 “The outlook also remains favourable on a weekly basis,”
 Ralf Umlauf , head of floor research at Helaba in Frankfurt,
wrote today. “The MACD is on the verge of issuing a buy signal,
which points to a stronger recovery phase for the euro.”  
 The euro must not fall below $1.2407 this week for the
momentum to continue, the note said. The euro, which has fallen
12.5 percent against the dollar this year, gained 1.6 percent
last week. It traded at $1.2534 as of 9:20 a.m. in London.  
 MACD charts can be used to indicate whether a price shift
is a change in trend or a short-term deviation by comparing
moving averages based on 9-, 12- and 26-day periods.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
