             France Telecom SA  unveiled a four-
part, five-year plan aimed at reviving morale and putting Chief
Executive Officer  Stephane Richard ’s stamp on the company.  
 The plan combines a mix of new and previously announced
goals including a doubling of revenue from emerging markets and
a two-billion euro investment in the domestic fibre network.
Richard presented the strategy to reporters in Paris today.  
 France Telecom is looking for new direction after a series
of suicides rocked the company and hastened the replacement of
former CEO  Didier Lombard . In April, Richard said the company
would spend as much as 7 billion euros ($8.8 billion) on deals
in Africa and the Middle East to boost emerging-markets growth.  
 “The group has set its sights on rekindling a spirit of
conquest in its international development,” the company said in
a statement. No “transformational” acquisitions are planned.  
 France Telecom  shares  rose 0.4 percent to 14.26 euros at
11:53 a.m. in Paris
