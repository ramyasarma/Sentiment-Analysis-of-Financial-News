             Free-agent forward Amar’e Stoudemire
says he has agreed to sign a contract with the New York Knicks.  
 Stoudemire, 27, has spent his eight-year National
Basketball Association career with the Phoenix Suns. Teams may
not sign players or discuss possible contracts publicly until
July 8.  
 “I feel great about being a pioneer and showing my
leadership,” Stoudemire told reporters at Madison Square
Garden, where signs at the entrance showed Stoudemire in a
Knicks uniform.  
 Stoudemire’s agent, Happy Walters, told reporters the deal
is for the maximum allowed, which would be five years for about
$100 million.
