             The Australian dollar fell against 14
of its 16 major counterparts on speculation the central bank
will highlight concerns that the global economic recovery may be
faltering and keep interest rates unchanged for a second month.  
 Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his
board will leave the overnight cash rate target at 4.5 percent
at the conclusion of their meeting at 2:30 p.m. in Sydney,
according to all 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
New Zealand dollar dropped toward a five-week low against the
yen as the nation’s business confidence declined in the second
quarter on slowing domestic demand, weakening the case for
further interest-rate increases.  
 “The market is a little bit worried that the RBA will
start to highlight downside risks to the global economy and they
may also decide to highlight the tightening of financial
conditions in the Australian economy,” said  Katie Dean , senior
economist in Melbourne at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. “We have seen currencies come off a little bit.”  
 The Aussie fell to 73.04 yen as of 11:51 a.m. in Sydney
from 73.67 yen in New York yesterday. It reached 72.69 yen on
July 1, the weakest level since May 25. The currency dropped to
83.45 U.S. cents from 83.93 cents. It touched 83.16 cents on
July 1, the lowest since June 10.  
 The New Zealand dollar fell to 59.88 yen from 60.43 yen.
The currency declined to 68.42 U.S. cents from 68.86. The
currency reached 67.95 U.S. cents on July 1, the weakest level
since June 10.  
 ‘Red Rag’  
 RBA Governor Glenn Stevens has boosted borrowing costs six
times since early October from a half-century low of 3 percent,
citing an economic expansion the central bank forecasts will
almost double to 4 percent in the next two years.  
 “This afternoon’s RBA board meeting is expected to
announce no change in official rates,”  John Kyriakopoulos ,
Sydney-based head of currency strategy at National Australia
Bank Ltd., wrote in a note today. “Any softening in the RBA’s
confidence about the economic outlook would be a red rag to a
bull and hurt the Australian dollar.”  
 The Aussie maintained losses after a government report
showed Australia’s trade balance surplus swelled to A$1.65
billion ($1.4 billion) in May from a revised A$1.12 billion in
April.  
 The so-called kiwi dropped as a net 18 percent of companies
 surveyed  expect the economy will improve over the next six
months, down from 22 percent in the first quarter, the New
Zealand  Institute of Economic Research  said today in Wellington.
The net figure, which is unadjusted for seasonal patterns, is
calculated by subtracting the proportion of pessimists from
optimists.  
 Fragile Recovery  
 “The recovery may be stalling,”  Shamubeel Eaqub ,
principal economist at the institute, told reporters today. “In
this environment the Reserve Bank needs to take care not to
stifle already anemic domestic demand and derail a fragile
export recovery.”  
 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor  Alan Bollard  last
month raised the official cash rate a quarter-point to 2.75
percent, the first increase in three years.  
 Australian government bonds rose. The yield on the 4.5
percent note maturing in April 2020 fell three basis points to
5.03 percent, according to Bloomberg data. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed
payment made to receive floating rates, fell to 4.11 percent
from 4.14 percent.
