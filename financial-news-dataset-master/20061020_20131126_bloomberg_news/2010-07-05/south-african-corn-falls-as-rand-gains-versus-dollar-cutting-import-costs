             Corn in South Africa, the largest
producer of the grain on the continent, fell as the rand
strengthened against the dollar, cutting the cost of imports for
local millers.  
 The rand traded at 7.6982 against the dollar at 12:18 p.m.
in Johannesburg, compared with 7.7239 at the close of grain
trading at noon on July 2.  
 White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, slipped 19.60 rand, or
1.7 percent, to close trade at 1,158.40 rand ($151) a metric
ton. Meal made from the grain is the country’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for December delivery dropped 15 rand, or 1.2
percent, to 1,212 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly for
animal feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are the
world’s largest exporters of the grain.  
 Wheat for September delivery rose 15 rand, or 0.6 percent,
to 2,385 rand a ton. Morocco, Egypt and Algeria are Africa’s
largest wheat growers.  
 Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold in tons:
