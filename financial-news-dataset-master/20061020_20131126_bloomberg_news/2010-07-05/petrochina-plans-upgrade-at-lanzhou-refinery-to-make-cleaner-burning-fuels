             PetroChina Co. , the nation’s largest
oil and gas producer, plans to build gasoline and diesel
hydrotreaters at its Lanzhou refinery in northwestern China to
produce cleaner fuels.  
 The company is conducting “preliminary work” on the
projects, China National Petroleum Corp., said in its online
 newsletter  today. The gasoline unit will have an annual capacity
of 1.8 million metric tons, or about 42,000 barrels a day, and
the diesel unit 3 million tons, the company’s parent said.  
 China’s state oil companies are upgrading their refineries
to produce fuels that meet emissions targets in the world’s
biggest polluter. The Lanzhou hydrotreaters will produce fuel
that can meet China III standards, which is similar to Euro III
specifications adopted by the European Union, CNPC said.  
 The Lanzhou refinery in Gansu province can process 10.5
million tons of crude oil a year.  
 CNPC expects to complete the expansion of its Qingyang
refinery in Gansu this year, the Beijing-based company said in a
separate statement today, without giving further details.
