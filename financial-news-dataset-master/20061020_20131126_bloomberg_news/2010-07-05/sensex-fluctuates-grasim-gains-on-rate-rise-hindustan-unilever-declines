             Indian stocks  fell after the central
bank increased interest rates for the third time this year to
control inflation.  
 Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. , the maker of half the cars sold
in India, dropped 1.4 percent.  Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. ,
a natural gas supplier owned by  Anil Ambani , plunged by a record
after the billionaire arranged to sell the company to his
Reliance Power Ltd. at a discount. The Reserve Bank of India
raised its benchmark interest rates on July 2, ahead of its July
27 policy meeting, to quell inflation.  
 “Knee-jerk stock-price dips due to a sell-off may be ideal
entry-points for investors,” said  Seth Freeman , chief executive
officer of San Francisco-based EM Capital Management LLC, who in
May correctly predicted the gain in small and mid-cap Indian
stocks. “Having gotten this rate increase over now may set the
stage for some marginal aggregate stock market gain over the
second half of the year.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 19.51, or 0.1 percent, to 17,441.44. The gauge declined for
the third day after swinging between gains and losses at least
26 times. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
was little changed at 5235.90. The  BSE 200 Index  was flat at
2,223.58.  
 Lower Volumes  
 Trading volume on the National Stock Exchange was at least
25 percent lower than last week’s average as a national 12-hour
strike protesting inflation called by opposition political
parties deterred some people from going to work. Volumes were
“very low,” said  Nilesh Karani , head of business development
at Magnum Equity Broking Ltd.  
 “We are working with almost 50 percent of strength in our
office,” said  Deven Choksey , chief executive officer at K.R.
Choksey Shares & Securities in Mumbai, who manages about $123
million.  
 Maruti lost 1.4 percent to 1,396.1 rupees.  Reliance
Communications Ltd. , India’s second-largest mobile-phone
operator, fell 2.8 percent to 185.5 rupees.  
 The Sensex was the best performer among the world’s 20
largest equity markets last quarter, even after central bank
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao raised rates at a faster pace than
nations including Indonesia and South Korea. Second-half buying
of stocks by overseas investors is poised to surpass the first
six months, according to the nation’s biggest bank, as the
government predicts the economy will expand at the quickest pace
in three years.  
 Expanding GDP  
 India’s $1.2 trillion  economy  will expand this year at the
fastest pace since 2008, the government forecasts. Net stock
purchases by overseas investors climbed 32 percent in the first
half to $6.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Reliance Natural sank 28 percent to 46.3 rupees, while
Reliance Power, which is building generators in India, climbed
3.3 percent to 181 rupees.  
 Reliance Power offered one of its shares for every four of
Reliance Natural, valuing the target at 43.825 rupees a share,
31 percent less than its July 2 close, before the talks were
announced. The deal is worth 71.6 billion rupees ($1.53 billion),
based on Reliance Natural’s 1.63 billion shares outstanding. A
Reliance Power spokesman declined to comment on the figures.  
 Indian stocks may gain 10 percent by the end of this year,
extending the longest quarterly rally since 1979, as the rate
increase by the central bank won’t derail economic growth,
Prudential Financial Inc. said.  
 Fund Flows  
 “In the near-term, the latest rate hike is likely to have
a negative impact on the Indian stock market,” said  John Praveen , chief investment strategist at Prudential International
Investments Advisers LLC, a unit of Prudential Financial, which
oversees $693 billion. By the end of 2010, the benchmark Sensex
index may rise to 19,200 as markets stabilize and the central
bank is “seen as being ahead of the curve,” he said.  
 The main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and communist
parties, which independently called nationwide 12-hour
stoppages, say truckers, shopkeepers and government workers
are backing their protest of the government’s June 25 decision
to stop subsidizing gasoline and diesel.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  5.37 billion rupees  of Indian
equities on June 30 and July 1, taking total investments in the
stocks this year to 310.8 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Ashok Leyland Ltd.  (AL IN), India’s second-biggest
truckmaker, jumped 4.7 percent to 65.5 rupees, its highest in
seven weeks. June sales more than doubled to 8,400 vehicles, it
said in a July 2 filing.  
 FIEM Industries Ltd.  (FIEM IN) soared 17 percent to 175.45
rupees, its highest close since the shares were listed in
October 2006. The auto-parts maker signed agreements to set up
manufacturing and purchasing ventures with Ichikoh Industries
Ltd., a Japan-based maker of automotive equipment, according to
its filing to the stock exchange today.  
 SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd.  (SREI IN) advanced 1.2
percent to 81.55 rupees. The company may raise 46 billion rupees
for a private equity fund to invest in infrastructure, Business
Standard reported, citing a company official it didn’t identify.
Chairman  Hemant Kanoria  couldn’t immediately be reached at his
office telephone for comment on the report.  
 Schrader Duncan Ltd. (SDL IN), a venture controlled by
Schrader Bridgeport International Inc., jumped by its daily
limit of 20 percent to 207.4 rupees. The company raised 2
billion rupees selling land in Mumbai, Press Trust of India
reported yesterday, citing people it didn’t identify. Schrader
Duncan’s Chairman  J. P. Goenka  wasn’t immediately available at
his office telephone for comment on the report.  
 Television Eighteen India Ltd.  (TLEI IN), a news
broadcaster, climbed 2.9 percent to 97 rupees after saying it
