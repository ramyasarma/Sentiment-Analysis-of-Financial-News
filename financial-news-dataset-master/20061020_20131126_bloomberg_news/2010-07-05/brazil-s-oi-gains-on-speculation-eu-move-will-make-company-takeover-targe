             Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA ,
Brazil’s biggest phone company known as Oi, gained on
speculation it will be a target for acquisition by Portugal
Telecom SGPS SA as the Lisbon-based carrier seeks to maintain a
foothold in Latin America’s largest economy.  
 The Portuguese government last week unexpectedly used its
veto power to block Telefonica SA’s 7.15 billion-euro ($8.96
billion) bid for Portugal Telecom’s stake in  Vivo Participacoes
SA , Brazil’s biggest mobile-phone company.  
 Investors are betting the European Union will void
Portugal’s decision, clearing the way for the sale of Vivo to
Telefonica and spurring Portugal Telecom to look for other
assets in Brazil, said  Maria Tereza Azevedo , an analyst at Link
Corretora in Sao Paulo.  
 “Investors are speculating the European Court of Justice
isn’t going to approve Portugal’s golden share” when it rules
on July 8, Azevedo said. “Once Portugal Telecom sells Vivo,
consequently investors think it would go after Oi.”  
 Telefonica’s offer for Portugal Telecom’s stake in their
50-50 venture Brasilcel NV, which owns 60 percent of Vivo, had
been accepted by 74 percent of the investors present at a
shareholders’ meeting in Lisbon on June 30.  
 Portugal Telecom hasn’t studied any concrete merger in the
Brazilian market and hasn’t mandated any third party to
negotiate a merger or the purchase of a stake in Oi, the
Portuguese company said in a regulatory filing yesterday.  
 Oi’s voting shares gained 1.6 percent to 38.10 reais while
the benchmark Bovespa index fell 0.9 percent.
