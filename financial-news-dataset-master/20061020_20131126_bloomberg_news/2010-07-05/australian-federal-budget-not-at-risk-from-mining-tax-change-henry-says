             Australia’s budget isn’t at “risk”
because of lower revenue forecast after the government last week
cut its proposed tax on resources company profits, Treasury
Secretary  Ken Henry  said.  
 While the Minerals Resource Rent Tax will generate lower
earnings than its predecessor, the Resource Super Profits Tax,
it won’t put pressure on the budget that is predicted to return
to surplus in 2012-13, Henry said in Canberra today.  
 “I don’t think I would agree that the budget is exposed to
a higher risk,” Henry told a Senate committee hearing.  
 Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  on July 2 scaled back a
proposed tax on mining companies to win their support. She
exempted most commodities, raised the threshold and cut the tax
to 30 percent on coal and iron ore earnings. Her predecessor
 Kevin Rudd ’s tax was to collect 40 percent from all resource
profits.  
 Henry said the Treasury revised up its forecasts for
commodity prices since the May budget and since the RSPT was
announced on May 2. Commodity prices are “volatile,” he added.  
 Gillard’s agreement extends the current Petroleum Resource
Rent Tax to all onshore and offshore petroleum and gas projects.  
 The levy will apply once a project’s return on investment
exceeds 7 percentage points more than the 10-year government
bond yield, currently about 5 percent. Previously it would have
kicked in for any return above the bond rate.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd., Rio Tinto Group and Xstrata Plc approved
the revised tax plan after meeting with Gillard, Treasurer  Wayne Swan  and Resources Minister  Martin Ferguson  last week.
