             The Hungarian government’s proposed
tax on financial institutions may hurt the country’s growth
prospects “considerably” in the short and long-term as the new
levy will weaken banks’ ability to raise capital and to lend,
the central bank said today.  
 “It is a cause for concern if measures taken in order to
restore fiscal discipline help raise other macroeconomic
risks,” the Budapest-based Magyar Nemzeti Bank said in a
statement posted on its website today. The tax may weaken the
stability of the Hungarian economy as it threatens banks’
ability to find external financing, according to the release.
