                  July 5 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) -- China’s Shandong
province has set an electricity purchase price of 1.7 yuan (25
cents) a kilowatt-hour for photovoltaic power plants for 2010.  
 The expense of providing the preferential tariff will be
shared between the central, provincial and municipal governments,
the Shandong government said in a statement posted on its
website. In addition to a national renewable energy subsidy, the
costs will be 55 percent covered by the province, and 45 percent
by the plant’s local government.  
 Next year and 2012, Shandong will lower the tariffs for
ground-mounted photovoltaic plants to 1.4 yuan and 1.2 yuan a
kilowatt-hour, respectively.  
 The eastern Chinese province will pay a subsidy of 10 yuan
per watt for selected solar rooftop and building-integrated
photovoltaic plant. The provincial government said its policy
will be in line with a national strategy to push private
investment in solar power businesses.  
 Shandong currently has 3.165 megawatts of solar capacity
and is building eight projects under China’s “Golden Sun”
program, which will subsidize about 50 percent of project costs.
The government expects to complete all of the 23-megawatt
Golden Sun projects by the end of 2010.  
 The provincial government plans to reach 50 megawatts of
solar capacity by the end of 2010, with 38 MW of ground-mounted
plants as well as 10 MW of rooftop and 2 MW of building-
integrated solar power plants.  
 Shandong aims to have 120 MW of ground-mounted solar
capacity by 2012. The province also targets 24 MW of rooftop and
6 MW of building-integrated photovoltaic plants by 2012, the
government said in its statement.
