                  July 5 (Bloomberg) --  Strabag SE , Austria’s biggest
builder, expects a 3 billion-euro ($3.8 billion) highway project
in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be cancelled in the next three weeks,
according to company spokeswoman  Diana Klein .  
 Republika Srpska allocated the order without a tender,
which made the project ineligible for loans from international
financing institutions, Klein said in a telephone interview from
Vienna, making it very difficult for Strabag to get financing
for the highway.  
 Strabag expects Republika Srpska, the Serbian-dominated
entity carved out of the war-torn country in 1995 as part of the
Dayton peace agreement, to now tender the project and Strabag
will apply for it again, Klein said.  
 As Strabag didn’t have the Bosnia project in its order
book, the order book  won’t be affected, she said.  
 The cancellation was first reported by Austria Press Agency.
