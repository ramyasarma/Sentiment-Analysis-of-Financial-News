             Treasury yields declined toward the
lowest level in 14 months before a private report that
economists said will show growth in U.S. service industries, the
biggest part of the economy, slowed in June.  
 The yield on the 10-year note declined five basis points to
2.93 percent as of 8:37 a.m. in Tokyo. The 3.5 percent security
due May 2020 climbed 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face amount, to
104 7/8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
