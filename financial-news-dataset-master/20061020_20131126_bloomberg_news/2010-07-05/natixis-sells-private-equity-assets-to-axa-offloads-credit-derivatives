             Natixis SA , the investment-banking
unit of France’s second-biggest bank by branches, will sell most
of its private-equity unit to Axa SA in a deal that values the
assets at 534 million euros ($670 million).  
 The price is 7.6 percent less than the fair market value as
of Dec. 31, Paris-based Natixis said today in a statement. The
businesses being sold include iXEN Partners, NI Partners and
Initiative & Finance Gestion, it said.  
 European banks are disposing of private equity assets as
they seek to boost capital ratios. Natixis in August received a
guarantee from its parent, BPCE SA, covering about 35 billion
euros of risky assets after posting a record 1.84 billion-euro
first-quarter loss last year. The bank reported its first profit
in more than a year for the third quarter of 2009.  
 Paris-based  Axa Private Equity  manages about $25 billion,
according to its website. Axa is Europe’s second-largest
insurer.  
 Natixis said in a separate statement today that it sold its
credit-derivative portfolios to an unidentified bank. The
holdings were not covered by the guarantee of parent bank BPCE
SA and their disposal will reduce earnings volatility, it said.
