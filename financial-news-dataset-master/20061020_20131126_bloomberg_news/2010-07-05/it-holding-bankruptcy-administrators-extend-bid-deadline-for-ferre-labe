             Administrators for  IT Holding SpA ,
the Italian fashion company being reorganized under government-
backed bankruptcy protection, extended the deadline for binding
offers for the  Gianfranco Ferre  label until Aug. 2.  
 The previous deadline was tomorrow, the administrators
said today in a statement. Potential bidders for Ferre now have
the same amount of time to prepare final offers as potential
bidders for the Ittierre SpA production unit, which makes
clothing under license for  Roberto Cavalli  and  John Galliano .  
 The administrators started the auctions of both units on
June 16.
