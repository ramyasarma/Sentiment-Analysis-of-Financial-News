             German Finance Ministry officials are
in talks with utilities over the future of nuclear power plants,
ministry spokesman Michael Offer said.  
 There’s “nothing to” newspaper reports that a planned tax
on nuclear fuels would not be implemented as envisaged, Offer
told reporters in Berlin today.  
 The ruling coalition intends to complete its plans for the
nuclear-power industry by the end of August, with a draft going
to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Cabinet for consideration in
September, the government said.  
 Merkel’s government favors an extension of the running time
of Germany’s nuclear plants beyond a cut-off date of about 2021
introduced by a previous administration.
