             Liberian gold production fell 68.5
percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth
quarter of last year, the Central Bank of Liberia said.  
 Total gold produced in the period was 5,412 ounces, compared
with 17,175 ounces during the previous quarter. The value of the
precious metal dropped to $1.56 million in the quarter, from
$4.92 million in the last three motnhs of 2009.  
 Diamond production for the period fell 49.2 percent to
4,920 carats in the first quarter from 9,693 carats in the
previous quarter amid a  slowdown in demand for the gem.   
 Rubber, Liberia’s main export commodity, had first quarter
output rise 55.1 percent to 13,460 metric tons, compared with
8,678 tons in the fourth quarter of 2009.   
 Cocoa, the second-biggest export product, rose 9.1 percent
to 1,735 metric tons at the end of March from 1,590 metric tons
in the December quarter due to the start of small scale farm
production.  
 “For the period under review, the value of rubber rose by
$9.2 million to $43.2 million,” the Bank said. “Export value
from cocoa beans was recorded at $1.4 million, from $1.1 million
registered during the previous quarter.”
