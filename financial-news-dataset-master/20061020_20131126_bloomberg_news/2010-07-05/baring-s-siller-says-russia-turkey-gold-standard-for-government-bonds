             The Russian and Turkish economies
“resemble a gold standard” for sovereign bond portfolios, said
Baring Emerging Europe Plc manager Matthias Siller in an e-
mailed statement today. The banking industry in emerging Europe
is in a position to “grow loan books from a base of high
capitalization ratios and ample liquidity,” he said. While
“sovereign bond markets have been swift to price this outlook,
emerging Europe’s equity markets still trade at a discount to
both global emerging markets and developed European markets,”
he said.
