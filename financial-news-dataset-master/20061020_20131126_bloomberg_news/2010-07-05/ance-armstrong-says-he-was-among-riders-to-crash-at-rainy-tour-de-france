             Lance Armstrong said he was among
riders that crashed on rain-slicked roads during today’s second
stage of the Tour de France.  
 The seven-time champion said in a video posted on his
RadioShack team’s website he scraped his hip and elbow in a
pile-up. He’s fifth in the overall standings, just ahead of
defending champion Alberto Contador.  
 “Rough day,” Armstrong said. “There was no way to stay
on your bike.”
