             Daimler AG , the world’s second-
largest luxury-car maker, said sales at its main Mercedes-Benz
brand rose 13 percent last month as the E-Class sedan attracted
buyers and demand in China almost tripled.  
 Mercedes-Benz sold 113,300 cars and sport-utility vehicles
compared with 100,300 a year earlier, Stuttgart, Germany-based
Daimler said today in a statement. Six-month deliveries jumped
15 percent to 556,700 vehicles.  
 Daimler is targeting  China , which passed the U.S. as the
world’s largest automobile market in 2009, with an extended
version of the E-Class, its first model designed specifically
for the country. Mercedes-Benz’s Chinese deliveries surged to
13,700 vehicles in June from 4,900 a year earlier,  Daimler  said
today. Sales rose 83 percent in India, 76 percent in Russia and
73 percent in Brazil.  
 “We are in an excellent position to do well in the months
ahead, and plan to continue Mercedes-Benz’s success with a
significant increase in the third quarter,”  Joachim Schmidt ,
sales chief of the Mercedes-Benz Cars division, said in the
statement.  
 Six-month E-Class sales rose 62 percent, with demand for
the station-wagon version more than doubling, Daimler said.
Deliveries of the top-of-the-line S-Class jumped 51 percent in
June and 29 percent in the first half.  
 Including the two-seat Smart city-car brand, sales at
Mercedes-Benz Cars rose 11 percent in June and 12 percent in
the first half. An updated Smart model, to be presented to the
media this month, will help the brand, Daimler said.
