             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros may rise today, according to Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
may climb to 0.732 percent, said Peter Chatwell, a fixed-income
strategist in London. The rate was 0.727 percent at the end of
last week, data from the British Bankers’ Association showed.  
 Libor for three-month dollars may slip to 0.53 percent from
0.534 percent, Chatwell said.  
 The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for three-
month loans may increase to 0.796 percent, he said. The rate was
0.79 percent at the end of last week, according to the European
Banking Federation.
