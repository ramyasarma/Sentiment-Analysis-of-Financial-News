             German utilities may have to sell
bonds and cede the interest to the German government in return
for an extension of the operating lives of the nation’s nuclear
power plants, Rheinische Post  reported .  
 The plan is an alternative to a proposed nuclear fuel tax,
which would generate 9.2 billion euros ($11.5 billion) for
federal coffers over the next four years, the newspaper said
without citing anybody.  
 While Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  still wants the
revenue, he is flexible regarding the instrument, the newspaper
said. The minister and the heads of Germany’s four biggest
utilities met on July 2, it said.  
 Under current German law, all nuclear power stations are to
close by about 2021.
