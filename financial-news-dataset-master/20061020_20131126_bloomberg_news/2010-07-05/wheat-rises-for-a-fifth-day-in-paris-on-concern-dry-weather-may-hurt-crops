             Wheat climbed for a fifth day in
Paris on concern that hot, dry weather in northwestern Europe
and Russia will hurt production.  
 Milling wheat for November delivery rose 2.7 percent to
154.25 euros ($193.32) a metric ton, the highest close for the
contract since June 2009, on NYSE Liffe. The grain has climbed
11 percent in the past five sessions.  
 Temperatures in France and Germany, the European Union’s
largest wheat growers, exceeded 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees
Fahrenheit) last week, reducing the yield potential for local
crops. The U.K., which ranks third, had its  driest first half 
of a year since 1929, the country’s Met Office said June 30.  
 Prices rose on “concerns about damage because of the
strong heat,” Paris-based farm adviser  Agritel  said in a
comment on its website. “Weather conditions in Russia remain
very adverse at the moment, with very high temperatures.”  
 Russia said July 1 it will cut the forecast for this
year’s grain crop from the current 88 million to 90 million
tons as the country suffers its worst drought in a decade.  
 Rainfall in some of the main French, German and U.K.
grain-growing regions was between 60 percent and 80 percent of
normal in the 180 days through June 29, according to forecaster
 Martell Crop Projections .  
 Dry Conditions  
 “Western Europe drought damage may be underestimated,”
agricultural meteorologist  Gail Martell , who heads the crop-
weather forecaster, said in a July 2 note on her website.
“Conditions have been dry for six months.”  
 Trading on the Chicago Board of Trade was closed today for
the Independence Day holiday.  
 Corn for November delivery rose a record 4.4 percent to
160 euros a ton in Paris, advancing for a fourth session to the
highest closing price since the contract started trading in June
last year.  
 “In corn, the dry conditions in France are starting to
worry the operators, while inversely in Hungary it’s floods
that seem to have destroyed about 16,000 hectares (39,500
acres),” Agritel said.  
 Excessive rain in May and June destroyed crops in Hungary,
according to the country’s agriculture ministry. France is the
European Union’s largest corn producer, ahead of Italy and
Hungary.  
 Rapeseed for November delivery rose 0.6 percent to 328.75
euros a ton in Paris. Malting barley for delivery in March
added 4.7 percent to 185 euros a ton.
