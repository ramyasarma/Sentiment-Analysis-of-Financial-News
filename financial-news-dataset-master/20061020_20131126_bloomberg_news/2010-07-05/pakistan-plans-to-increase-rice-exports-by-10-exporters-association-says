             Pakistan plans to ship 10 percent
more rice overseas in the year starting July 1, according to the
exporters’ trade group.  
 “The target depends on the availability of water and the
monsoon rains,” Malik Jahangir, chairman of the Rice Exporters
Association of Pakistan, said by telephone from Karachi today.
“We expect international prices to be higher.”  
 Pakistan exported 4.6 million tons of rice worth $2.27
billion in the year ended June 30, Jahangir said. The country
sold $2.02 billion of rice in the previous year.
