             China may make the China Investment
Corp. sell off its banking stakes so it can meet requirements to
invest in the U.S., the Financial Times reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  
 Under the proposals, the $200 billion sovereign wealth fund
will no longer be responsible for holding the government’s
majority stakes in banks including Bank of China, the report
cited the people as saying. The bank holdings were valued at
about $70 billion when China Investment was established in 2007,
the Financial Times said.
