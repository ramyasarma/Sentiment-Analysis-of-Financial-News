             Shougang Corp. ’s Peruvian unit
declared force majeure on iron-ore shipments as a strike entered
its eighth day, Deputy Manager  Raul Vera  said.  
 Shougang Hierro Peru SAA’s workers, who walked off the job
June 28, rejected a 2.90-sol ($1.02) daily pay increase and
annual bonus of 87 soles proposed by the  government , Vera said
today in a telephone interview. Workers are seeking a daily
raise of 5.50 soles, union spokesman  Cirilo Yarihuaman  said. The
Peruvian government mediates when companies and unions are
unable to reach a labor accord.  
 “The increase doesn’t cover our needs,” Yarihuaman said
in a telephone interview. “We demand a similar increase to last
year as the company’s doing well.”  
 Shougang workers have staged five strikes in the past 12
months, adding to labor unrest at zinc, gold and silver mines in
Peru this year. Force majeure is a legal clause that allows
miners to miss contracted deliveries because of circumstances
beyond their control.  
 Hierro Peru’s iron-ore output jumped 30 percent this year
through May to 2.36 million metric tons from the same period in
the previous year, according to the  Energy & Mines Ministry . The
mine has 1,600 workers.
