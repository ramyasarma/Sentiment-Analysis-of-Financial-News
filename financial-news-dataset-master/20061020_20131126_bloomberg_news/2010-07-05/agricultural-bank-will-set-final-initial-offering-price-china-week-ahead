             Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. will
set the final pricing for its initial public offering for Hong
Kong and Shanghai on July 7.  
 Agricultural Bank  is offering 25.4 billion shares in Hong
Kong at between HK$2.88 and HK$3.48 apiece, while selling 22.2
billion shares in Shanghai at 2.52 yuan to 2.68 yuan each,
according to  a June 29 statement . It will hold an online road show
for the domestic IPO today.  
 The bank’s valuation discount to its closest rivals has
halved in seven trading days, making the world’s biggest initial
public offering in almost four years less appealing to investors.  
 Shares in the Hong Kong part of Agricultural Bank’s IPO are
valued at an average 5.3 percent less than its three biggest
competitors as measured by  book value , based on the top end of the
IPO price range and data compiled by Bloomberg. When the bank
priced the offering on June 24, the gap was 10.5 percent.  
 China will announce property prices for June, and release
trade data from last month. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key
will visit China this week.  
 Laurence Barron, the president of Airbus SAS’s China unit and
 Air China Ltd. ’s Senior Vice President He Li will be among
attendees at an aviation conference in Beijing this week.  
 The China Automotive Technology & Research Center will
announce June vehicle sales data today. Liu Tienan, vice director
of the National Development and Reform Commission, in charge of
the country’s coal and electricity affairs, will be among the
speakers at a coal conference in Dalian this week.  
 First-Day Trading  
 Shares of  Tangshan Port Group Co.  will begin trading for the
first time today on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The company,
based in eastern China’s Hebei province, offered its shares on
June 21 at 8.20 yuan each, raising 1.64 billion yuan to finance
its expansion.  
 China’s stocks  advanced for the first time in eight days on
July 2, paring the benchmark index’s biggest weekly drop in 16
months, as investors speculated recent losses were excessive.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  gained 9.11, or 0.4 percent, to
close at 2,382.90, reversing an earlier 2.3 percent loss. The  CSI
300 Index  added 0.3 percent to 2,534.10.  
 China Vanke Co.  and Poly Real Estate Group Co. drove gains by
developers, the worst performing stocks in Shanghai this year, and
PetroChina Co. rebounded from its lowest level since January 2009.  
 Yuan forwards completed a fourth weekly gain on July 2 as the
euro rallied against the dollar after Spain successfully sold
bonds at an auction July 1.  
 The yuan’s spot rate climbed 0.15 percent to 6.7711,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trading System. The
Chinese currency has gained 0.28 percent last week. The rate
earlier reached 6.7696 a dollar, the strongest level since the end
of 1993.  
 Government Bonds  
 Government bonds rose last week as the benchmark money-market
rate receded from a three-week high, reflecting the increased
availability of cash at banks.  
 The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures lending costs
between banks, slid 54 basis points last week to 2.61 percent,
according to the daily fixing rate published by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  
 The yield on the 3.9 percent government note due in August
2014 fell three basis points to 2.49 percent, and the price of the
security added 0.11 per 100 yuan face amount to 105.47, according
to the funding center. For the week, the yield dropped eight basis
points.

week:
