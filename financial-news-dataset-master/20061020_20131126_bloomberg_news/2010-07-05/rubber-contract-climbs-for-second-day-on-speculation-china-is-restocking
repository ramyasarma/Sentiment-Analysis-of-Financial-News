             Rubber futures in Tokyo, which closed
unchanged today, may decline later this week on speculation that
supply from Thailand, the largest exporter, may gain and a
stronger Japanese yen.  
 Futures in Tokyo swung between a gain and loss of 0.6
percent before settling at 266.6 yen per kilogram ($3,031 a
metric ton). The December-delivery contract touched 260.3 yen on
July 2, the lowest level since June 10, on concern that a
slowing global economic recovery may weaken demand for the
commodity used for tires and gloves.  
 The contract “may head lower tomorrow as the yen continues
to appreciate, while supplies in Thailand have gradually
improved,” said  Chaiwat Muenmee , an analyst at Bangkok-based
commodity broker DS Futures Co.  
 Cash prices in Thailand were also unchanged at 112.60 baht
($3.47) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Institute of
Thailand. The volume of rubber traded in southern Thailand, the
main producing region, rose to 145 tons today compared with
about 120 tons per day in recent weeks, Chaiwat said.  
 The yen traded near a seven-month high against the dollar
before reports today and tomorrow that economists said will show
European investor confidence weakened and U.S. service
industries expanded at a slower pace. The yen rose to as much as
87.65 per dollar from 87.75 on July 2.  
 November-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained 1 percent to settle at 21,605 yuan ($3,191) a ton.  
 Still, tight global supplies and strong demand, especially
from China, may support prices, the  Association of Natural-
Rubber-Producing Countries  said in its June newsletter.  
 The possibility of a “marked improvement” in supply in
the short term is limited given aging trees and weather
constraints, the association said June 30.
