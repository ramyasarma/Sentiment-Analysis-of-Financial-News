             CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets will remain
part of Credit Agicole SA under any agreement with Citic
Securities Co. of China, Credit Agricole’s Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Paul Chifflet told Les Echos in an interview.  
 Citic and Credit Agricole said in May they were in talks to
combine their global equity brokerage units and investment-
banking operations in Asia.  
 Credit Agricole has no current liquidity problems and
doesn’t expect any to arise, Chifflet told the newspaper in
today’s interview. Stress-test result publication would help
confidence, he said, adding that no European country is going to
go bankrupt.
