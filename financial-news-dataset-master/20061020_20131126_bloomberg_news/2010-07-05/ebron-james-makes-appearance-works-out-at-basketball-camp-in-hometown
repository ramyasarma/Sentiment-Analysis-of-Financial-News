             LeBron James made an appearance at
his Nike basketball camp in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, taking
a break from his meetings with teams bidding to sign him to a
free-agent contract.  
 James, 25, is not expected to announce until the end of the
camp on July 7 where he will play next season. The two-time
reigning Most Valuable Player, who has spent his entire seven-
year NBA career with the Cleveland Cavaliers, is being courted
by the New York Knicks, Chicago Bulls, New Jersey Nets, Miami
Heat and Los Angeles Clippers as well as the Cavaliers.  
 The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported James “looks to be
leaner than end of season, no hint of elbow issue” during his
workout at the camp today.
