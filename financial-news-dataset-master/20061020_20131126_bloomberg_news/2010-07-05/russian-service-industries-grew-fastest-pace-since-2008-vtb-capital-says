             Russian  service  industries from banks
to mobile phone retailers expanded in the past three months at
the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2008, signaling
consumer demand is invigorating the  recovery .  
 The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 55.4 last month,
compared with 55.9 in May and 56.9 in April, VTB Capital said in
an e-mailed statement today. The index, based on a survey of
about 300 purchasing managers, shows expansion with a reading
above 50. The gauge remained above 50 for an 11th straight month
even as growth slowed to the weakest since March.  
 “The visible economic recovery supported optimism in the
sector,”  Svetlana Aslanova , an analyst at VTB Capital, said in
the report. “ The relatively stable growth of business in the
sector supported further job creation.”
