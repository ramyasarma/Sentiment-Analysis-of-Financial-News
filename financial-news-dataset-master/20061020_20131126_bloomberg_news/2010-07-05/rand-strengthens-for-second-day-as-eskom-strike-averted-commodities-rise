             The rand strengthened for a second
day after a strike at South Africa’s state-owned power utility
that had threatened to hobble industrial output was averted and
as commodity prices increased.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest economy appreciated as
much as 0.7 percent to 7.6794 per dollar, before trading 0.1
percent higher at 7.7315 by 10:37 a.m. in Johannesburg, from a
previous close of 7.7364.  
 The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa welcomed
a decision by Eskom Holdings Ltd., the company that supplies
about 95 percent of the country’s electricity, to lift its pay
offer to 9 percent to avert a strike during the World Cup.  
 Platinum for immediate delivery rallied as much as 1
percent to $1,515.75 an ounce, while gold increased for a second
day, gaining as much as 0.3 percent to $1,214.60 an ounce. The
two precious metals are South Africa’s biggest exports.  
 “The Eskom strike being averted and rising metal prices
are having a positive influence on the currency,”  Duncan Howes ,
a currency trader at Absa Group Ltd. said by phone from
Johannesburg. The rand may move between 7.65 and 7.75 in quiet
trade as the U.S. markets are closed for the Independence Day
holiday, Howes said.  
 Eskom would not have been able to guarantee power supply if
unions had gone on strike today, the utility said July 1, adding
that a strike would damage the economy and affect the World Cup
that ends July 11.  
 Government bonds fell for the first time in four days, with
the 13.5 percent security due September 2015 sliding 12 cents to
123.22 rand. The yield on the bond gained 2 basis points to 7.94
percent.  
 Investors increased bets the central bank will reduce its
6.5 percent benchmark interest rate when it next meets on July
22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month
contracts  for cash in three months fell 2 basis points to 6.36
percent, equaling a 6 1/2-year low reached on April 21.
