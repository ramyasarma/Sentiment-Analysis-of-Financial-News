             A genetic mutation linked to breast
cancer in women also predisposes men to the disease, with 1 in
12 male carriers developing tumors by age 80, researchers said.  
 Scientists from Manchester and Birmingham, England, tracked
321 families with faulty BRCA2 genes to pinpoint the risk for
men who have the mutation. The study, published in the  Journal
of Medical Genetics , found 7.1 percent of men developed the
disease by age 70. The risk rose to almost 9 percent in the
following decade, the study found.  
 While 60 percent of women with mutations in a breast cancer
gene develop malignancies, the risk in men isn’t as well known,
said researchers led by Gareth Evans from the Department of
Genetic Medicine at  Manchester Academic Health Science Centre 
and St. Mary’s Hospital. The results of the study, the largest
ever conducted in BRCA2-affected families, confirms the lifetime
risk is as great as 9 percent, they said.  
 “These risks are sufficient to increase awareness of
breast cancer among men in BRCA2 families and to stress the
importance of early presentation with breast symptoms,’’ the
researchers said.  
 Breast cancer is the most common tumor in women, affecting
12 percent over the course of a lifetime, according to the  U.S.
National Cancer Institute . More than 200,000 women were
diagnosed with the disease last year in the U.S., compared with
less than 2,000 men, according to the  American Cancer Society .
About 40,000 women and 390 men died from the disease.
