             The average remuneration for senior
U.K. chief executives increased 5 percent since 2008 even as
overall company performance dropped, according to a report.  
 While heads of  FTSE 100  companies were paid 3.1 million
pounds ($4.7 million) on average, earnings per share for
Britain’s largest companies declined 1 percent, according to
data compiled by consultancy group MM&K and proxy governance
agency  Manifest .  
 Over the past 10 years, CEO pay has quadrupled even as
share prices dropped, according to the Total Remuneration Survey
2010. The time-scale for long-term incentive plans has also
shortened to three years, compared with an average time frame of
seven to 10 years a decade ago. Manifest said the shift from
long-term incentives to annual bonuses mirrors the approach that
led to the banking crisis.  
 Manifest chief Sarah Wilson said remuneration committees
are finding it tougher to resist the demands of CEOs and “are
scared they’ll do a prima donna and flounce off somewhere else”
if they aren’t well rewarded.  
 “What shareholders are worried about is it that CEO pay is
galloping away and performance is not galloping along with it,”
she said.  
 CEOs of larger companies can make up to as much as 300
percent of their salary as bonus, the survey showed.  
 The remuneration survey examined the published reports of
FTSE 350 companies, comparing data from 2008 and 2009.  
 The report follows investor backlash against Tesco Plc last
week, when more than a third of shareholders voted against the
U.K. retailer’s remuneration report.
