             Brazil’s real fluctuated between
gains and losses as forecasts that Brazilian policy makers will
raise interest rates more than previously estimated offset
concern the global recovery will slow.  
 The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.7749 per dollar at 10:32
a.m. New York time, from 1.7721 on July 2.  
 A July 2 central bank survey of about 100 economists showed
policy makers will raise the benchmark interest rate to 12.13
percent by year-end, up from a week-earlier forecast of 12
percent. Latin America’s biggest economy may expand 7.2 percent
this year, faster than the 7.13 percent forecast a week ago.
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  urged
“austerity” measures to contain budget deficits yesterday,
following reports last week that showed U.S. payrolls dropped
for the first time this year and factory orders slumped.  
 “The good shape of the Brazilian economy” and the
prospect of additional hikes in interest rates are boosting the
real,  Silvio Campos Neto , chief economist at Banco Schahin SA,
said in an e-mail from Sao Paulo. “On the other hand, the
increase of risk aversion in the international markets and the
decrease in commodity prices, reflecting the worse expectations
for the global economy recently, put pressure on the real. It’s
hard to decide which signal will prevail.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 11.32 percent.
