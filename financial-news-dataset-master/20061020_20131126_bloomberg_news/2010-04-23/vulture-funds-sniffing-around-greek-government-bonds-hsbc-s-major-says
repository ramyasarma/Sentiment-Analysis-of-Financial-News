             Greek government bonds are
attracting interest from emerging market and distressed debt
investors, which may help them rally after an aid package was
requested by Greece, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  
 “The vultures are coming in,” Steve Major, global head of
fixed-income research at HSBC in London, said in a telephone
interview. “There are people sniffing around. Most of my calls
have been with emerging market investors and distressed buyers.  
 ‘‘The Greek market is pretty much shut to traditional
investors, because they’re already long and wrong,’’ Major said.
‘‘You need to find some new demand.’’
