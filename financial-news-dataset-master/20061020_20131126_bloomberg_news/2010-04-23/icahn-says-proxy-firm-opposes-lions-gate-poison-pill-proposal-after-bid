             Carl Icahn, who is seeking to buy
Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., said proxy adviser Riskmetrics
Group Inc. urged investors to vote against the independent film
studio’s “poison pill” proposal.  
 The poison pill bars investors from accepting certain
partial bids and grants the board too much discretion, Icahn
said today in a statement, citing the RiskMetrics reports.  
 RiskMetrics’ view is at odds with Glass Lewis & Co.,
another shareholder advisory group, which is supporting
management of Vancouver-based Lions Gate and backing the poison
pill. Icahn, who owns almost 19 percent of Lions Gate, is
offering $7 a share for the maker of the “Saw” and “Tyler
Perry” movies, valuing the company at about $826 million.  
 Lions Gate, run from Santa Monica, California, rose 15
cents to $7.04 at 12:10 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares had gained 19 percent this year
before today.
