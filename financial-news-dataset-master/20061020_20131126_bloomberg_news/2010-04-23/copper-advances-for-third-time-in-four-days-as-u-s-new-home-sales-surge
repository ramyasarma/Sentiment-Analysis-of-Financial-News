             Copper rose for the third time in
four days after a report showed purchases of new U.S. homes
jumped in March by the most since 1963.  
 Home sales climbed 27 percent to an annual pace of 411,000,
the Commerce Department said. Builders are the biggest users of
copper, using about 400 pounds for pipes and wires in the
average house. The metal has gained 77 percent in the past 12
months.  
 “The home-sales data was strong, so we’re seeing some of
the buying come back into copper,” said Frank McGhee, the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago. The
metal also rose as the dollar retreated, he said.  
 Copper futures for July delivery rose 2.4 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.5305 a pound on the Comex in New York. The metal
was little changed this week after falling 1.5 percent last
week.  
 Gains were limited today on concern that Greece’s budget
deficit will derail growth in Europe. Efforts by China, the
world’s biggest metal buyer, to cool expansion also limited
copper’s rally.  
 “Curbs in China, coupled with weakness in Europe,” may
send copper lower, said Nick Moore, an analyst at RBS Global
Banking & Markets in London. “We are going to see markedly
lower imports” by the Asian nation, he said.  
 Copper for delivery in three months climbed $60, or 0.8
percent, to $7,750 a metric ton ($3.51 a pound) on the London
Metal Exchange. Aluminum and tin also rose on the LME, while
lead, zinc and nickel dropped.
