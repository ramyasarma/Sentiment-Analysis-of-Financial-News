             Cornell University hired Virginia
Tech assistant Bill Courtney as basketball coach, succeeding
Steve Donahue, who left for Boston College this month, the
Associated Press reported.  
 Cornell spokesman Jeremy Hartigan declined to comment on
the report, which the AP said was based on information from two
unidentified people familiar with the deal. Hartigan said the
school would hold a 3 p.m. press conference at its Ithaca, New
York, campus to introduce its new coach.  
 Courtney, 39, spent one season at Virginia Tech after eight
years as coach Jim Larranaga’s assistant at George Mason
University. The Patriots reached the semifinals of the 2006
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  
 Donahue coached Cornell to three consecutive Ivy League
titles and led the Big Red to the regional semifinals in this
year’s NCAA tournament.
