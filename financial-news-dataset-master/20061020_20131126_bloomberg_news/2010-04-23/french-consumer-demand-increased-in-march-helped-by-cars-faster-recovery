             French consumer spending rose in
March as car sales began to revive and signs of an accelerating
recovery buoyed confidence.  
 Spending on manufactured goods climbed 1.2 percent from
February, when it fell a revised 1.4 percent, national
statistics office Insee said today. Economists expected a 0.8
percent advance, the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  
 The first increase in household demand this year is the
latest sign that Europe’s export-led recovery is starting to
bolster sentiment among shoppers and help sustain the recovery
in the months ahead. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
forecast for France’s expansion in 2010, saying the economy will
grow 2.5 percent instead of the 1.8 percent expected previously.  
 The improvement in French spending comes as the European
Commission reported yesterday that consumer confidence is
improving in the euro region as a whole.  
 Spending on new cars is improving again in France after
dropping in the year’s first two months after a government-
incentive program was cut back on Dec. 31.  
 The plan, which offered 1,000 euros ($1,321) for every 10-
year-old car traded in, now only provides 700 euros. The
reduction prompted buyers to bring purchases forward, though
those who missed the original deal are now returning to the
market, economists said.  
 “The gradual dwindling of the post-scrappage scheme effect
is starting to lift car sales,” said Pierre-Olivier Beffy,
chief economist at Exane BNP Paribas in Paris.
