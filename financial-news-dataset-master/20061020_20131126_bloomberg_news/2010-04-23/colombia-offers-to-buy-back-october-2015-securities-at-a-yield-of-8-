             Colombia offered to buy back peso
bonds due in October 2015 at a yield of 8 percent in an
exchange that looks to extend maturities as the government faces  
 its biggest budget deficit in five years.  
 Colombia plans to repurchase today five fixed-rate bonds
and two inflation-linked securities and will offer in return
inflation-indexed debt due in March 2013, February 2023 and new
May 2017 notes.  
 The Finance Ministry said in a statement it will buy back
its fixed-rate securities due November 2010 at a yield of 3.5
percent and August 2012 at 5.7 percent. It also offered to
repurchase bonds due in November 2013 at 6.95 percent and May
2014 at 7.3 percent. The government offered to buy back debt in
inflation-linked currency units known as UVRs maturing September  
 2010 at a yield of 0.95 percent and January 2012 at 2.8 percent.
