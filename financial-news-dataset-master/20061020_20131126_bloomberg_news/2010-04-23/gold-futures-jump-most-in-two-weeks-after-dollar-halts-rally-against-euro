             Gold rose the most in two weeks
after the dollar halted a six-session rally against the euro,
boosting the appeal of the precious metal as an alternative
investment.  
 The euro rebounded from the lowest level in almost a year
after Greece asked for a bailout from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund, easing concern that mounting debt
will erode the value of the 16-nation currency. Gold rose 24
percent in 2009 as the dollar fell 2.5 percent against the euro.  
 “Gold is inextricably connected to the currency story,”
said Kevin Davitt, a senior market strategist at LaSalle Futures
Group in Chicago. “Gold is firming because the dollar is off
its highs, and the euro has rebounded from its lows.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in June rose $10.80, or 0.9
percent, to $1,153.70 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since April 7. The metal
climbed 1.5 percent this week.  
 Greece asked the EU and IMF to activate a loan of 45
billion euros ($60 billion). Gold priced in euros rose to a
record today on lingering debt concerns.  
 “The ink is just drying on the aid package for Greece, and
the euro story hasn’t run its course,” Davitt said. “You can
make an argument either way for gold” as a haven against the
euro or an alternative investment to the dollar, he said.  
 Gold touched $1,135.20 before rebounding on speculation the
economic recovery in the U.S. will spur the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates.  
 Durable Goods, Housing  
 Orders for durable goods excluding transportation rose 2.8
percent in March, the most since the recession began in December
2007, Commerce Department data show. Purchases of new homes in
the U.S. surged 27 percent, the most since April 1963, the
agency said.  
 The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero
percent and 0.25 percent since December 2008 to revive the
economy, helping send the dollar down 4.2 percent against a
basket of six major currencies in 2009. Higher borrowing costs
may extend the dollar’s 4.5 percent rally this year and send
gold lower, analysts said.  
 “The Fed tightening will continue to obstruct any
meaningful rally in gold prices as it sustains dollar strength
into the third quarter,” Deutsche Bank AG said in a report.  
 Silver futures for May delivery rose 18.4 cents, or 1
percent, to $18.223 an ounce on the Comex, capping a 3.1 percent
gain this week.  
 Platinum futures for July delivery dropped $2.50, or 0.1
percent, to $1,741.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The metal rose 2.7 percent this week.  
 Palladium futures for June delivery declined $1.90, or 0.3
percent, to $563.20 an ounce. This week, the price climbed 5.9
percent, the fourth straight gain.
