             The euro may weaken to $1.27 as
European Union member nations decide whether to endorse a plan
to provide Greece with financial aid to help it manage its debt,
CMC Markets said.  
 “Markets are aware of a potential disagreement from
individual EU members about disbursing aid as well as the
legality of the bailout process,” Ashraf Laidi, chief market
strategist at CMC in London, wrote today in an e-mailed note.
“The path of lesser resistance remains to retest the $1.30
figure and eventually $1.27.”  
 The euro was little changed at $1.3305 as of 12:38 p.m. in
London. It rose from an intraday low of $1.3202 today after
Greece requested financial support from the EU and the
International Monetary Fund.
