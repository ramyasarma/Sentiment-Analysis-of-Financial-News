             The European Union’s delay in
organizing an aid package for Greece highlights the
vulnerability of other countries such as Spain and Portugal,
former Bank of England policy maker David Blanchflower said.  
 “Are they going to resolve this Greek problem, is it going
to be resolved in an amicable and speedy way? The answer doesn’t
really look that way,” Blanchflower said in a Bloomberg
Television interview today from Dartmouth College, New
Hampshire. Spain and Portugal “do look in some degree of
trouble,” and “if you can’t deal with Greece, then it looks
like there are other dominoes to fall.”  
 Greece today asked the EU and International Monetary Fund
for the activation of a financial lifeline of as much as 45
billion euros ($60 billion). With national debt of almost 300
billion euros, the nation faces a fiscal crisis that threatens
to spread to Spain and Portugal, forcing the EU to set up the
aid facility.  
 “Greece is a very small part of the European area, and
it’s taken them an awfully long time to deal with it,”
Blanchflower said. “It seems to me this is crucial,
particularly for the ECB, to fix this thing, and they certainly
don’t appear that they’re doing so” even considering Greece’s
aid application.

                          April 23 (Bloomberg) -- Former Bank of England policy maker David Blanchflower, an economics professor at Dartmouth College and Bloomberg columnist, talks with Bloomberg's Deirdre Bolton about the European Union's delay in implementing its aid package to Greece and the impact on market sentiment.
      Blanchflower also discusses the results of his study on the correlation between money and happiness and the narrowing gap between genders in the U.S. when it comes to overall life satisfaction. (Source: Bloomberg)
