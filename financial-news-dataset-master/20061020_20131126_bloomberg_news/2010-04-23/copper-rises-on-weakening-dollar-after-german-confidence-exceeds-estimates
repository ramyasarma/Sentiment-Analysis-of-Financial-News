             Copper rose in London, reducing a
second weekly drop, as the dollar weakened after European
industrial orders and business confidence in Germany increased
more than estimated.  
 Orders to industrial companies in the 16-nation euro area
gained 1.5 percent in February, the European Union statistics
office said. Economists forecast a 1 percent climb, according to
the median of 20 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The
Munich-based Ifo institute’s business climate index advanced to
101.6, above the 98.7 estimated in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “A positive German Ifo number saw a recovery in the euro,
which helped to lift base metals,” said Randy North, a trader
at RBC Capital Markets in London.  
 Copper for delivery in three months rose $35, or 0.5
percent, to $7,725 a metric ton at 10:31 a.m. on the London
Metal Exchange, narrowing this week’s retreat to 0.5 percent.
Futures for July delivery gained 0.3 percent to $3.5165 a pound
on the Comex in New York.  
 The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, slipped 0.1 percent, erasing a climb of as
much as 0.6 percent. Gains by the dollar make commodities priced
in the currency more expensive in terms of other monies.  
 The index is still up 0.8 percent this week, lifted by
concern about sovereign finances in Europe. Moody’s Investors
Service yesterday cut Greece’s debt rating after the EU said the
country’s budget deficit last year was wider than forecast by
the government.  
 “Concerns about sovereign risk remain, and gains are
likely to be capped for the moment,” RBC’s North said.  
 Zinc for three-month delivery on the LME dropped 0.1
percent to $2,415 a ton and nickel fell 0.8 percent to $26,885 a
ton. Tin gained 0.5 percent to $19,000 a ton, aluminum fell 0.5
percent to $2,309 a ton and lead rose 0.2 to $2,312 a ton.
