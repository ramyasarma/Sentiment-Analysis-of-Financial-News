             Aberdeen Asset Management Plc is
disposed to accept Argentina’s offer to restructure $20 billion
in defaulted bonds that were held out of a 2005 settlement, fund
manager Edwin Gutierrez said.  
 “We are favorably disposed given the alleged terms, but
until we see the official terms we can’t make an official
decision,” Gutierrez said in a telephone interview from London.  
 Economy Minister Amado Boudou on April 15 said the
government will offer investors 33.7 cents on the dollar for
securities due in 2033, warrants linked to gross domestic
product, and pay past due interest with 8.75 percent dollar
bonds due in 2017. The government will not include past-due
payments on the GDP warrants.
