             Italian unemployment may rise to 11
percent by 2012 as the full effect of the worst recession since
the World War II ripples through the labor market, research
institute Prometeia said.  
 “The full effects of the recession, in terms of permanent
employment and unemployment, still haven’t materialized,” the
Bologna-based institute said today in a report. “Wages will be
penalized by growing unemployment.”  
 Joblessness stalled at 8.5 percent in February as
businesses waited for clearer signs of economic recovery before
hiring. The euro region’s third-biggest economy emerged from the
recession in the third quarter of last year and contracted again
in the three months through December.  
 The International Monetary Fund said this week in its World
Economic Outlook that Italy’s unemployment rate will rise to 8.7
percent this year before falling to 8.6 percent in 2011.
