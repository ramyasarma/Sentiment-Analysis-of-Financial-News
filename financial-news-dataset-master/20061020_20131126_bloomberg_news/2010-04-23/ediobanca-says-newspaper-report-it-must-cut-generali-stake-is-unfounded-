             Mediobanca SpA said press reports
that the Bank of Italy plans to force the lender to reduce its
stake in Assicurazioni Generali SpA to 10 percent are
‘completely unfounded,’’ a spokeswoman said in a telephone
interview.  
 Newspaper la Repubblica today reported that the central
bank would force Mediobanca to trim its 13.5 percent within two
years.
