             European stocks climbed, paring a
weekly decline, after Adidas AG raised its earnings forecast,
Volvo AB posted an unexpected profit and business confidence in
Germany improved.  
 Adidas, the world’s second-biggest sporting-goods maker,
advanced 3.9 percent and Volvo, second-largest truckmaker,
soared the most in 14 months. Akzo Nobel NV rallied 5 percent
after posting increased earnings and receiving expressions of
interest for its food additives unit. Taylor Wimpey Plc, the
homebuilder that gets 32 of revenue from North America, soared
the most in almost a year as U.S. home sales jumped.  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.8 percent to 267.42. The
benchmark gauge for European shares has declined 0.2 percent
this week, its second straight weekly loss.  
 “The consensus continues to underestimate earnings
growth,” Graham Bishop, a European equity strategist at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in a report sent to clients
today. “Earnings revisions remain positive for each and every
quarter of 2010. Sales and earnings ‘beat ratios’ are high.”  
 Per-share earnings at western European companies have
topped analysts’ estimates by an average of 14 percent since the
U.S. earnings season began on April 12, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Greek Aid  
 The Stoxx 600 has climbed 5.3 percent in 2010 as the
European Union agreed a 45 billion-euro ($60 billion) aid
package to help Greece tackle the region’s biggest budget
deficit. Greece today called for activation of the financial
lifeline in an unprecedented test of the euro’s stability and
European political cohesion.  
 National benchmark indexes advanced all 18 western European
markets, except Greece and Iceland. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed
1 percent, France’s CAC 40 rose 0.7 percent and Germany’s DAX
rallied 1.5 percent. Greece’s ASE Index slipped 0.2 percent.  
 German business confidence rose to a two-year high in April
as the global economic recovery boosted export demand and warmer
weather allowed workers back onto construction sites. The Ifo
institute in Munich said its business climate index, based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, increased to 101.6 from 98.2 in
March. Economists expected a gain to 98.7, according to the
median of 37 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Even so, the U.K. economy grew half as much as economists
forecast in the first quarter, underscoring the recovery’s
fragility. Gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent from the
final three months of 2009, the Office for National Statistics
said today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists was for a 0.4 percent gain.  
 Adidas Advances  
 Adidas climbed 3.9 percent to 44.50 euros. The company
raised its earnings forecast for the year after profit rose for
the first time in five quarters ahead of this year’s football
World Cup.  
 Volvo surged 10 percent to 90 kronor, the biggest jump
since February 2009. The truckmaker posted first-quarter net
income of 1.68 billion kronor ($231 million). Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg had forecast a loss of 8.25 million kronor.  
 Renault SA, which owns 20 percent of Volvo, surged 6.9
percent to 36.72 euros.  
 Akzo Nobel rallied 5 percent to 45.97 euros. The world’s
largest coatings company said it got approaches for National
Starch, a food additives unit that generated about 900 million
euros in sales last year. The company reported a 38 percent
advance in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, excluding the starch division.  
 Taylor Wimpey Gains  
 Taylor Wimpey rallied 9.8 percent to 43.99 pence, leading a
gauge of construction shares to the biggest gain among 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600. Purchases of new homes in the
U.S. surged in March by the most in almost five decades as
buyers rushed to qualify for a government tax credit and the
weather turned milder.  
 Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA jumped 6.7 percent to 39.34 euros,
the biggest increase in two months. Europe’s largest supplier of
building materials reported first-quarter sales of 8.74 billion
euros, beating the estimates of brokerages including Exane BNP
Paribas.  
 Wendel, Saint-Gobain’s biggest shareholder, rallied 5
percent to 48.90 euros. Ireland’s CRH Plc, the world’s second-
largest building-materials maker, climbed 6.4 percent to 21.50
euros, the most in almost a year.  
 Ericsson AB, the world’s largest maker of wireless
networks, soared 10 percent to 88 kronor, the highest level
since 2007, after reporting that first-quarter North American
sales doubled and projecting further growth in the region.  
 Ericsson, Postbank  
      Gross-margin estimates will increase and this may lead to
earnings upgrades, Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Kulbinder
Garcha wrote in a report today. The brokerage also said Ericsson
is trading at a 20 percent discount to industry rivals.  
 Deutsche Postbank AG rose 3.1 percent to 26.40 euros, the
highest close since October 2008, amid speculation that part-
owner Deutsche Bank AG is preparing a full takeover of the
retail lender.  
 “There is speculation that Deutsche Bank may pay 36 euros
to 37 euros per Postbank share, that it may be planning a
capital increase for this purpose and that it will carry out the
Postbank takeover in the near future,” Konrad Becker, an
analyst at Merck Finck & Co. in Munich who recommends selling
Postbank stock, said by phone. Deutsche Bank spokesman Michael
Lermer declined to comment.  
 STMicroelectronics NV, Europe’s largest chipmaker, fell 5.1
percent to 7.29 euros for the biggest decline in the Stoxx 600.
The company’s ST-Ericsson joint venture reported a wider first-
quarter loss and forecast “approximately flat” sales.
