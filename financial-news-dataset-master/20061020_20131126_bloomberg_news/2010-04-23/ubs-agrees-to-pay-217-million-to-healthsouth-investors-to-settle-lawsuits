             UBS AG agreed to pay $217 million
to HealthSouth Corp. shareholders and bondholders to settle
litigation they brought after an accounting fraud was discovered
at the health-care services provider.  
 The settlements between UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank,
and the securities holders are the final ones in the litigation
and were entered in the case docket yesterday. The shareholders
will receive $117 million and the bondholders $100 million. In
addition, Ernst & Young LLP, HealthSouth’s accounting firm,
agreed to pay the bondholders $33.5 million. It settled with the
shareholders last year for $109 million.  
 The litigation stems from a $2.7 billion fraud at
HealthSouth that led to guilty pleas from 15 executives,
including five former finance chiefs. The fraud unraveled in
March 2003 when federal agents raided the offices of Birmingham,
Alabama-based HealthSouth, the largest U.S. provider of
inpatient rehabilitation services. The discovery caused a drop
in the company’s share price that wiped out almost $6 billion in
market value.  
 “We believe these substantial settlements reflect a great
result for bond purchasers who were damaged as a result of the
massive fraud at HealthSouth,” David Bronner, chief executive
officer of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, the lead
bondholder plaintiff, said in an e-mailed statement.  
 Judge’s Approval  
 In settling, both Zurich-based UBS, HealthSouth’s
investment bank, and New York-based Ernst & Young denied
wrongdoing. U.S. District Judge Karon Bowdre in Birmingham must
approve the agreements.  
 “UBS continues to deny all charges of wrongdoing or
liability arising out of its engagement for HealthSouth,”
Kristopher Kagel, a spokesman for the company, said in an e-
mailed statement. “As established in multiple proceedings,
HealthSouth’s corrupt insiders repeatedly lied to UBS bankers.
This settlement is fully funded by insurance, except for a less
than 3 percent co-insurance payment by UBS.”  
 “This settlement allows us to resolve the litigation
brought by the bondholders of HealthSouth and avoid lengthy
litigation,” Charles Perkins, a spokesman for Ernst & Young,
said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The HealthSouth accounting fraud took place from 1996 to
2002, according to former chief financial officers who testified
at the 2005 criminal trial of HealthSouth founder Richard
Scrushy, who was acquitted. Scrushy is serving six years and 10
months in prison for his 2006 conviction on charges he bribed
former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman.  
 Total Settlements  
 The UBS settlements bring the total for the shareholders to
at least $601 million. In addition to the Ernst & Young
agreement last year, the shareholders reached a $355 million
settlement with HealthSouth in 2006 and got $20 million from UBS
in an Alabama state-court case.  
 The total for the bondholders is at least $228.5 million.
They got $90 million from the HealthSouth settlement and $5
million from UBS in state court.  
 In addition, both classes will receive what can be obtained
from a $2.88 billion judgment against Scrushy in an Alabama
state-court case.  
 “These are excellent settlements for the bondholder class
after many years of hard-fought litigation,” Max Berger, a
lawyer for the bondholders at Berstein Litowitz Berger &
Grossmann LLP, said in a phone interview today. “The class will
recover a substantial percentage of their damages.”  
 Raising Billions  
 UBS in 2008 agreed to pay HealthSouth $100 million over
claims the bank didn’t see the fraud while raising billions of
dollars for the company. HealthSouth said it would use the money
to cover legal expenses, pay shareholders and bondholders and
cut debt.  
 The case is In re HealthSouth Securities Litigation,
03cv1500, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama
(Birmingham).
