             Poland’s ruling Civic Platform 
party has a narrower lead over the largest opposition party, 
Law & Justice, the newspaper Rzeczpospolita’s Web site rp.pl 
reported, citing two polls by GfK Polonia and by SMG KRC 
Millward Brown.  
 Civic Platform would beat Law & Justice by 46 percent to 26
percent in a general election, according to a GfK Polonia poll 
of 987 Polish voters surveyed from April 8 to April 14, 
narrowed from a margin of 53 percent to 27 percent in the 
previous poll in March, rp.pl said.  
 The ruling party slipped even more in the SMG KRC Millward 
Brown poll of 1,509 voters, performed for television station 
TVN, which showed support for Civic Platform at 41 percent, 
down 6 percentage points from the previous survey, while Law & 
Justice stood at 35 percent, up 14 percentage points, rp.pl 
said.
