              India’s monsoon rains may be
normal this season, the country’s weather office said in a
statement in New Delhi.   
 Falls in the June-September season will be 98 percent of
the 50-year average, the India Meteorological Department said.  
 The weather bureau considers rains to be near normal if
they are between 96 and 104 percent of the long-range average.
