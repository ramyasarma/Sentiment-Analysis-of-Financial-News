             South African security authorities
asked Germany’s soccer team to drop the hotel it is planning to
stay at during the World Cup due to safety concerns, the Times
reported, citing an official in Police General Bheki Cele’s
office who didn’t want to be identified.  
 The building of the four-star Velmore Hotel on the
outskirts of the capital, Pretoria, was not approved by local
government, the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported today,
without specifying if the safety concerns were related to
insecure structures.  
 The FIFA World Cup is due to run from June 11 to July 11.
