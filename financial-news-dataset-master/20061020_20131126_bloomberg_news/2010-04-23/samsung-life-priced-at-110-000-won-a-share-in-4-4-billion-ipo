             Samsung Life Insurance Co. (032830) ’s
shareholders aim to raise 4.89 trillion won ($4.4 billion) in
 South Korea ’s biggest initial public offering after setting the
offer price near the top of a marketed range.  
 The nation’s biggest life insurer set the IPO price at
110,000 won a share, the company said in a regulatory filing
today. That compares with the indicative range of 90,000 won and
115,000 won apiece.  
 CJ Cheiljedang Corp., Shinsegae Co. and other shareholders
will sell 44.4 million shares. Samsung Life will take
subscriptions on May 3 and May 4, and plans to start trading its
shares on South Korea’s main exchange on May 12.  
 The company’s total market value will be 22 trillion won
based on the offer price, which would make it the sixth largest-
capitalized company on the benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  stock index.  
 The IPO is the third by a South Korean life insurer after
 Tong Yang Life Insurance Co. (082640)  and  Korea Life Insurance Co. (088350)  The
South Korean government allowed life insurers to list in 2007,
resolving a dispute over how to allocate proceeds from the sales
between company owners and policyholders.  
 Insurance premium income in South Korea increased annually
at an average 8.8 percent from the fiscal year of 1990 to 2008,
compared with average economic growth of 5.6 percent. The
nation’s life insurance market has 14 domestic and eight foreign
companies.  
 The top three life insurers -- Samsung Life, Korea Life and
Kyobo Life Insurance Co. -- controlled 51.7 percent of the
market as of the end of last year, according to a Samsung Life
regulatory filing on April 16.  
 Rising Profit  
 Samsung Life posted 652.2 billion won of net income in the
nine months through December 2009, compared with 342.4 billion
won a year earlier, the company said  in a filing  on Feb. 16.
Samsung Electronics Co. Chairman Lee Kun Hee owns 20.8 percent
of the insurer, followed by Samsung Everland Co. with 19.3
percent as of Dec. 31.  
 Samsung Life’s IPO follows Korea Life Insurance’s 1.78
trillion won share sale in March and Tong Yang Life’s 340
billion won share sale in September.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Korea Investment & Securities
Co. are lead arrangers of the share sale. Merrill Lynch & Co., a
unit of  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and Shinhan
Investment Corp. are also helping arrange the sale.
