             Hornby Plc, the maker of Scalextric
racing cars, rose the most since 2001 in London trading after
saying it would resume paying dividends on a better-than-
expected full-year performance.  
 Hornby climbed as much as 17 percent. The company “will be
reporting profits in excess of market expectations” after “a
significant reduction in inventories,” Margate, England-based
Hornby said in a Regulatory News Service statement today. Debt
dropped to 3.2 million pounds ($4.9 million) as of March 31 from
11.8 million pounds a year earlier.  
 “For the new financial year, there remains some
uncertainty in respect of consumer confidence but order intake
has continued strongly across all our brands,” the company said
in the statement.  
 Hornby dropped its final dividend in June due to profit and
cash generation being hurt by the weakness of the pound. The
company is trying to broaden its audience beyond adult males
with products such as a Toy Story 3 train due in September.  
 The shares advanced as much as 20 pence to 138 pence and
traded at 137.25 pence as of 10:44 a.m. The stock has fallen 2
percent this year, giving the company a market value of 52.2
million pounds.
