             New Jersey, the third-most indebted
U.S. state, will save about $679 million in debt service through
2013 in a restructuring that exceeded state estimates, a
spokesman for Treasurer Andrew Eristoff said.  
 The $703 million deal for the New Jersey Economic
Development Authority, which sold to yield 3.52 percent, cuts
New Jersey’s debt payments by $68 million this year and $611
million over the next three years, according to an analysis by
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the manager of the sale. The
savings had been projected at $60 million in the current year
and $605 million over the following three.  
 The restructuring adds $856 million in debt costs between
2014 and 2020, the Merrill analysis shows.  
 Eristoff declined to comment on the transaction, through
his spokesman, Andrew Pratt.  
 Separately, the state sold $104 million in taxable Build
America Bonds maturing from 2032 to 2035 to yield 6.425 percent,
or 175 basis points over 30-year Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 The bonds were the first sold since Governor Chris Christie
took office Jan. 19. The state plans to offer $750 million of
federally subsidized Build Americas the week of May 10, Pratt
said today in an interview.  
 California and New York are the first- and second-most
indebted U.S. states.
