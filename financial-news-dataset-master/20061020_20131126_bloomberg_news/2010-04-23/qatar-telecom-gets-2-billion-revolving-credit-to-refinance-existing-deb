             Qatar Telecom QSC said it got a $2
billion revolving credit facility to refinance existing debt.  
 The credit line is split into a $1.25 billion portion
maturing in 2013 and a $750 million part expiring in 2015,
according to a Regulatory News Service statement.  
 The facility will replace a $2 billion loan signed last
year that matures in November 2011, according to the statement.  
 BNP Paribas SA, DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Societe Generale
SA, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Qatar National Bank
arranged the financing. The facility will be syndicated to other
lenders, Qatar Telecom said in the statement.
