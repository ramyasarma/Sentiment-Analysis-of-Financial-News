             Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., sliced another $1
million off the asking price of his Chicago mansion.  
 Going into its fourth year on the market, the Gold Coast
neighborhood property is now listed for $9.5 million, according
to the Web site of broker Sudler Sotheby’s International Realty.
It was previously listed for $10.5 million by Koenig & Strey
GMAC Real Estate.  
 Dimon bought the house at 25 E. Banks St. in 2000 when he
headed Chicago-based Bank One Corp. The 15,000 square-foot
mansion has eight bedrooms, nine full bathrooms and was built in
the late 1800s. Dimon first listed it for sale in April 2007 for
$13.5 million.  
 “It’s a statement home,” said Jim Kinney, vice president
of luxury sales for Baird & Warner, a residential brokerage in
Chicago. “It represents an attractive value in the
neighborhood.”  
 The house, near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach, has a
rooftop terrace, wine vault and gym, according to the listing.
Located on the corner of tree-lined Astor and Banks streets, it
lies in one of the city’s most expensive neighborhoods and is
among the largest homes in the Gold Coast.  
 Sluggish Market  
 The problem is that demand for Chicago’s high-end homes is
“sluggish, sluggish, sluggish,” Kinney said, even though
overall sales in the nation’s third-largest city climbed 50
percent to 1,814 in March.  
 The median price fell 4.6 percent to $209,000 from a year
earlier, the Illinois Association of Realtors said in a
statement yesterday.  
 “While there has been some improvement in delinquencies
and home prices in some markets, we believe that significant
improvements will depend largely on an improving economy,”
Dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.  
 Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment.  
 Dimon, 54, helped engineer the sale of Bank One to JPMorgan
Chase in 2004. He and his wife Judith bought the Banks Street
property in 2000 for $4.7 million, according to records on the
Web site of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds.
