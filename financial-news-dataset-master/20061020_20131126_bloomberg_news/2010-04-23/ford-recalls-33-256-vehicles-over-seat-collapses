             Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling
33,256 vehicles, including its best-selling Fusion, because
front seats and head rests may collapse back during a crash.  
 The voluntary recall affects 2010 model-year vehicles
including the Ford Explorer and Mercury Milan, according to a
notice today on the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration’s Web site.  
 The affected seats manually recline and will be replaced by
manual seats without the defect or power seats, Ford said in the
notice. The models affected are Ford’s Explorer and Explorer
Sport Trac sport-utility vehicles, Ford’s Fusion and Mercury’s
Milan and Mountaineer.  
 “We’re not aware of any accidents or injuries” associated
with the defect, said Wes Sherwood, a spokesman for Ford.
Sherwood declined to identify the supplier of the seats.  
 The automaker, based in Dearborn, Michigan, will notify
owners by April 30 to bring vehicles to dealers for repairs free
of charge.  
 Ford fell 3 cents to $14.17 at 11:08 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 42 percent this
year before today.  
 Toyota Motor Corp. announced record U.S. recalls this year
and last year because of defects that may cause unintended
acceleration, including in its top-selling Camry and some Lexus
models.
