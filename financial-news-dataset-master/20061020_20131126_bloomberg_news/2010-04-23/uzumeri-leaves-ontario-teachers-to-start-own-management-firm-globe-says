of private equity at Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan this week to
start his own money-management firm, the Globe and Mail reported
in its Streetwise column, citing unidentified people.  
 Uzumeri, 40, ran a C$10 billion ($9.97 billion) arm of the
pension fund, the newspaper said. He declined to tell the
newspaper about plans to start his own company.
