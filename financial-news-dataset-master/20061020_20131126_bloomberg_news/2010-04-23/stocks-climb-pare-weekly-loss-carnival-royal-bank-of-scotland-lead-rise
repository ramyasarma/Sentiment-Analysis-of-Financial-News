             U.K. stocks advanced the most in
three weeks, trimming their weekly drop, as prospects for global
economic growth overshadowed a smaller-than-forecast increase in
British gross domestic product.  
 Wolseley Plc, Carnival Plc and InterContinental Hotels
Group Plc, which all get more than half of sales outside the
U.K., surged at least 4 percent. Taylor Wimpey Plc jumped the
most in a year after U.S. new homes climbed 27 percent.  
 The benchmark FTSE 100 Index rose 58.32, or 1 percent, to
5,723.65, the most since April 1. The increase pared this week’s
retreat to 0.4 percent. The FTSE All-Share Index gained 1.1
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rallied 2.8 percent.  
 The biggest budget deficit in 70 years and prospects for
parliamentary gridlock are failing to keep U.K. shares from
beating Europe’s largest markets in 2010. The FTSE 100 remains
5.7 percent higher this year as investors bet a weak pound and a
rebound in global economic growth will help the index, which
relies in overseas markets for most of its members’ sales.  
 “We remain positive about the outlook for U.K. equities,”
wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists Darren Winder and Rob
Griffiths in a report distributed today. We “consider the risks
to current bottom-up profit estimates to be weighted to the
upside.”  
 Britain’s GDP rose 0.2 percent from the final three months
of 2009, when a 0.4 percent expansion ended the recession, the
Office for National Statistics said today in London. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 32 economists was for a
0.4 percent increase.  
 German, U.S. Economy  
 In Germany, business confidence rose more than economists
forecast to a two-year high in April as the global economic
recovery boosted export demand and warmer weather allowed
workers back onto construction sites. Orders for U.S. durable
goods excluding transportation surged in March by the most since
the recession began in December 2007, adding to evidence the
recovery is broadening and strengthening.  
 About 70 percent of earnings for FTSE 100 companies are
made outside of the U.K., according to Credit Suisse Group AG in
Zurich.  
 Wolseley, the world’s largest supplier of heating and
plumbing products, rose 5.4 percent to 1,658 pence. The company
generates 45 percent of its revenue in North America.  
 Carnival increased 5.9 percent to 2,850 pence, the biggest
advance in 10 months. The world’s biggest cruise-line operator
got more than 60 percent of sales outside Europe in 2008.  
 Intercontinental Increases  
 InterContinental advanced 4.4 percent to 1,122 pence, the
most since October. The owner of the Holiday Inn brand gets 55
percent of revenue in the Americas.  
 Taylor Wimpey, who builds homes in U.S. southern states,
soared 9.8 percent to 43.99 pence. Purchases of new homes in the
U.S. surged in March by the most in almost five decades, the
Commerce Department said today, as buyers rushed to qualify for
a government tax credit and the weather turned milder.  
 CRH Plc, the world’s second-largest building-materials
maker, climbed 6.4 percent to 21.49 euros as of 5 p.m. in
Dublin.  
 The following stocks also rose or fell in London. Stock
symbols are in parentheses:  
 Air Partner Plc (AIP LN), the company that charters planes
for the U.K.’s Queen Elizabeth II, advanced 28 pence, or 8.4
percent, to 360. The carrier said today it’s received an
increase in enquiries for business as a result of the closure of
European airspace by a volcanic ash cloud this month.  
 Hornby Plc (HRN LN) jumped 19 pence, or 16 percent, to 137,
the biggest gain since 2000. The maker of Scalextric racing cars
said it would resume paying dividends on a better-than-expected
full-year performance.  
 SIG Plc (SHI LN), Europe’s largest supplier of insulation
and roofing, rose 7.5 pence, or 5.8 percent, to 137.8, the
biggest increase since February. The shares were raised to
“buy” from “hold” at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  
 Analysts’ “forecasts have fallen consistently since 2008,
and sentiment remains weak, but we believe a turning point is
now within sight” for SIG, RBS wrote in a report.
