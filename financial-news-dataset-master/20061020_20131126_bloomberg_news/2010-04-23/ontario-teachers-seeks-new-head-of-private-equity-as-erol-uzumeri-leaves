             Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan will
search for a new head of private equity after Erol Uzumeri said
he’s leaving the Toronto-based pension fund manager.  
 Uzumeri, who joined Teachers’ in 2003, plans to leave on
May 14, said spokeswoman Deborah Allan. The Globe and Mail
reported today he’s starting his own money-management firm.
Chief Investment Officer Neil Petroff will assume Uzumeri’s job
in the interim, Allan said. Ontario Teachers’ is Canada’s third-
biggest retirement plan.  
 A message left with Uzumeri wasn’t immediately returned.
