             Mexico must change the law to allow
for the quicker resolution of bad loans to help reduce the cost
of credit and make it more available, said Alejandro Valenzuela,
chief executive officer of Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB.  
 A bank in Mexico may take three to four years to resolve
non-payment on a home loan, whereas in the U.S. it takes about
three to four months, Valenzuela said. The lengthy recovery
drives up interest rates and makes banks more risk adverse, he
said. Banorte is the second-largest Mexican-owned bank.  
 “To become more efficient, we need a more effective
judicial system,” Valenzuela said in an interview during a
banking conference in Acapulco. “Many times, the just pay for
the sinners.”
