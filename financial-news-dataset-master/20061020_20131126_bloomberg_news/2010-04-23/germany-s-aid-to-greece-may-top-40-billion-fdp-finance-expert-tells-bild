             Germany’s loans to Greece are
“likely” to exceed 30 billion euros by the end of 2012, Bild
reported, citing Frank Schaeffler, a member of the parliament’s
finance committee.  
 Schaeffler, from the government’s junior coalition partner,
the Free Democratic Party, said that after 2012 Germany might
have to extend more loans, Bild reported.  
 The government previously said that as much as 16.8 billion
euros in loans will have to be provided to Greece, according to
Bild.
