             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, may use surplus capital
to buy back part of the taxpayer’s holding, said two people with
knowledge of the situation.  
 RBS and the government are considering the proposal after
the bank’s shares rose last week, giving the Treasury a paper
profit on its stake, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private. The U.K. may also sell
part of its 45.5 billion-pound ($70 billion) stake in Edinburgh-
based RBS to money managers, the people said.  
 RBS may have 15.3 billion pounds of surplus capital by 2012
as the lender sells assets and closes operations, Michael
Helsby, a London-based analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch
said in a note to investors this month. Share buybacks are a
“likely outcome,” he wrote.  
 A buyback would help the British Exchequer cut the
country’s 152.8 billion-pound deficit, the biggest since World
War II. The U.K. government has made a paper profit of about 5
billion pounds on its investment in RBS after the shares rallied
91 percent this year. Taxpayers own 84 percent of the lender.  
 Linda Harper, an RBS spokeswoman, declined to comment as
did a spokesman for UKFI, which manages the government’s
holdings in the bank.
