             Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker
in North America, rose the most since September after a report
showed Mexico’s construction industry will grow 2.3 percent this
year.  
 Nuevo Leon, Mexico-based Cemex jumped as much as 7.3
percent, the most on an intraday basis since Sept. 17, to 14.5
pesos. It rose 6.7 percent to 14.42 pesos at 2:14 p.m. New York
time.  
 Employment in the construction industry will rise 3.2
percent from last year, according to a report by the Mexican
Construction Industry Chamber, known as CMIC, released yesterday
after the market closed. The business will recover after
suffering its worst contraction since 1995 last year, it said.  
 “The construction industry will initiate a period of
gradual recuperation in 2010, although not with the speed that
we need to compensate for the loss of production and jobs that
the sector experienced in 2009,” the report said.
