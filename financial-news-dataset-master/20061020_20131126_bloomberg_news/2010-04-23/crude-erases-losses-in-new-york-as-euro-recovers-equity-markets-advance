             Crude oil erased earlier losses in
New York as the euro recovered against the dollar and as
European equity markets advanced.  
 Crude oil for June delivery rose as much as 30 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $84 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $83.99 at 9:50 a.m. London
time. The contract earlier fell as much as 0.4 percent to $83.37
a barrel.
