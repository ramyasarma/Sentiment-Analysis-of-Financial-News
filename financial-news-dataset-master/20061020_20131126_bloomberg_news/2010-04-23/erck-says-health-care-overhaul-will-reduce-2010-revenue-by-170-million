             Merck & Co. said the U.S. health-
care overhaul will cut $170 million from revenue this year
because of changes including increased Medicaid rebates.  
 The law will reduce the company’s revenue by $35 million in
the first quarter. For 2011, the changes will trim $300 million
to $350 million from sales, Merck said today in a statement.  
 The health-care law won’t affect the forecast of annual
earnings growth in the high single-digits through 2013, Merck
said, without providing specific numbers. Drugmakers Eli Lilly &
Co., Abbott Laboratories, and Johnson & Johnson have also
projected reduced sales because of the overhaul.  
 The drugmaker rose $1.69, or 5 percent, to $35.46 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, for the biggest
single-day gain in more than four months. Before today, the
stock had fallen 6.4 percent since Tuesday on concerns about how
much the law would affect Merck’s earnings.  
 The law, which President Barack Obama signed in March,
increases the level of rebates that companies have to offer
through the Medicaid benefits program for the poor and changes a
tax on retiree medical benefits.  
 Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, plans to
release first-quarter results on May 4.
