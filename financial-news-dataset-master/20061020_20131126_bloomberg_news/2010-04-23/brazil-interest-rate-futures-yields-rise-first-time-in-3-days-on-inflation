             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts rose for the first time in three days after
inflation exceeded economists’ forecasts before a central bank
meeting next week.  
 The yield on the contract due January 2011 jumped three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.72 percent at 3
p.m. New York time. The yield on the contract gained 0.32
percentage point this month as inflation expectations
accelerated. The real rose 0.1 percent to 1.7623 per U.S.
dollar, from 1.7638 yesterday. The currency has dropped 0.2
percent this week.  
 Consumer prices climbed 0.76 percent in the month through
April 22, according to a report released today by the Getulio
Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey with 10 economists was for an increase of 0.7
percent. The index rose 0.8 percent in the previous month.  
 The central bank will lift its benchmark Selic rate for the
first time in 19 months on April 28 from a record low of 8.75
percent, according to a Bloomberg survey with 32 economists.
Nineteen economists expect an increase of 0.5 percentage point,
11 economists forecast a lift of 0.75 percentage point while two
economists bet on a hike of 1 percentage point.  
 “The Brazilian central bank is already behind the curve on
inflation,” Nick Chamie, head of emerging market research at
RBC Capital Markets in Toronto, wrote in a report e-mailed to
clients today. The prospect for continued upward pressure on
yields is “significant,” particularly if the central bank opts
to start the tightening cycle with an increase of 0.75
percentage point in the Selic next week, he wrote.
