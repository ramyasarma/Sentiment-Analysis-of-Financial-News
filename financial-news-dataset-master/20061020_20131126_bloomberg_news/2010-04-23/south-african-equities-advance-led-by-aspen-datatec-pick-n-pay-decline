             South Africa’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index rose 109.06, or 0.4 percent, to 28,931.40. That
pares the measure’s drop this week to 0.4 percent, a second
weekly decline.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 Cie Financiere Richemont SA (CFR SJ), the world’s second-
largest luxury-goods maker, rallied 82 cents, or 3 percent, to
28.61 rand, its biggest gain in more than eight weeks. Kepler
Capital Markets raised its price estimate on the luxury-goods
company to 52 francs from 42 francs and kept a “buy” rating
because of “the rebound in retail sales in key markets” and
“strong watch export data.”  
 Coronation Fund Managers Ltd. (CML SJ) climbed 68 cents, or
6.5 percent, to 11.12 rand, the biggest increase in more than
three months. The Cape Town-based money manager said fiscal
first-half earnings per share rose between 210 and 230 percent.  
 MTN Group Ltd. (MTN SJ), Africa’s largest mobile-phone
company, increased 2.49 rand, or 2.3 percent, to 110 rand, the
biggest gain since March 18. Johannesburg-based MTN said it has
started unspecified talks that may or may not lead to a
transaction.  
 Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK SJ) fell 46 cents, or 1.1
percent, to 41.94 rand, bringing its decline this week to 5.8
percent. South Africa’s second-largest food retailer was cut to
“sell” from “hold” by Citigroup.  
 Deutsche Bank AG equity analyst Nick Higham yesterday cut
his recommendation on the stock to “hold” from “buy.” The
company said April 21 that trading conditions in the first six
months of fiscal 2011 will remain difficult.  
 Pretoria Portland Cement Co. (PPC SJ) rallied 1.10 rand, or
3.1 percent, to 33.20 rand, the biggest gain in a month.
Africa’s largest producer of cement said fiscal first-half
earnings per share rose more than fivefold after a year-earlier
charge wasn’t repeated.  
 SABMiller Plc (SAB SJ), the world’s second-biggest brewer,
rallied for a fifth day, climbing 3.22 rand, or 1.4 percent, to
235.50 rand. The increase takes its weekly gain to 8.8 percent,
the strongest five-day increase since November 2008. SABMiller
plans to build a new plant in Namibia for $34 million to push
its Castle and Castle Lite brands further into the country.
