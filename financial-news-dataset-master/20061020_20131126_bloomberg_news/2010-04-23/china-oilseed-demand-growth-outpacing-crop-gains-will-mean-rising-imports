             China’s rising consumption of
oilseeds, including soybeans, will outpace the gains in domestic
production, forcing the country to boost imports next year, a
unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.  
 Demand will rise 4.1 percent to 100.58 million metric tons
in the year that begins Oct. 1 from an estimated 96.619 million
a year earlier, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service said
today in a report on its Web site. The consumption gain will
exceed the increase in domestic output, which will rise to 56.95
million tons from 54.63 million this year, the agency said.
Imports will jump to 44.109 million from 42.509 million.  
 China, the fastest-growing major economy, is consuming more
food as the population expands and rising incomes allow people
to eat more meat. A shortfall in oilseeds is boosting demand for
soybeans from the U.S., the largest exporter. U.S. shipments to
China may rise to 19.5 million tons from an estimated 19 million
forecast in the year ending Sept. 30, the USDA unit said.  
 “Strong soybean imports will be driven by increasing
demand for vegetable oils and animal products as consumers
respond to continuing GDP growth in 2010,” Mark Petry and Wu
Xingping, agricultural specialists for the USDA in Beijing.  
 China’s economy grew 11.9 percent in the first quarter, the
fastest pace in almost three years, the government said April
15. The country is the world’s largest consumer of oilseeds and
the biggest importer of soybeans.  
 Demand for animal feed made from oilseeds is forecast to
rise 5 percent to 54.282 million tons in the year that begins
Oct. 1, compared with an estimated 51.701 million tons this
year, according to the report. Imports, mostly fishmeal, will
rise to 1.513 million tons from 1.403 million this year.  
 Demand for vegetable oils may rise 4.6 percent to 26.527
million tons next year from an estimated 25.361 million this
year, the FAS said.
