             A painting by the Russian artist
Erik Bulatov last night was the top lot in a 4.1 million-pound
($6.3 million) auction of art from some of the world’s fastest-
growing economies.  
 The Non-Conformist artist’s Cyrillic word painting
“ENTRANCE -- NO ENTRANCE” fetched 713,250 pounds at the first
sale of contemporary works from Brazil, Russia, India and China.
Phillips de Pury & Co.’s 32-lot evening session of its inaugural
“BRIC’’ event, held at London’s Saatchi Gallery, made a total
with fees exactly in line with the presale upper estimate, based
on hammer prices. Seventy-two percent of the material found
buyers, with all the successful lots falling to telephone bids.  
 The sale comes after auction prices for works by some
contemporary Chinese, Indian and Russian artists had declined as
much as 50 percent from the peak of the market in early 2008,
with dealers now looking for signs of recovery.  
 “Russia and China were strong,’’ Roger Tatley, senior
director at the London-based Alison Jacques Gallery, said in an
interview. “The Saatchi venue was very elegant. I’m sure it was
a great benefit to have the auction hung like a museum show,
though it was unusual to have everything bought on the
telephone. That might have had something to do with the volcanic
ash grounding planes.”  
 Bulatov’s 1994 to 1995 work, a second version of a 1970s
painting now in the Pompidou Center in Paris, was one of just
half a dozen lots that attracted bidding from the 100-strong
audience in the room. A woman wearing grey five-inch heels
speaking Russian into a cellphone was the underbidder at a price
that was more than double the 350,000-pound low estimate.  
 Well-Heeled  
 The well-heeled Russian-speaker was also the underbidder
when Komar & Melamid’s tongue-in-cheek 1972 canvas “Meeting
Between Solzhenitsyn and Boell at Rostropovich’s Country House’’
sold for 657,250 pounds, more than four times the 150,000-pound
upper estimate.  
 Zhang Xiaogang’s 2006 painting “Amnesia and Memory” was the
most expensive of the Chinese contemporary works at 385,250
pounds. This was valued at 220,000 pounds to 320,000 pounds.  
 In recent years, Brazilian contemporary artists haven’t
attracted the same levels of speculative investment as their
Chinese, Indian and Russian counterparts.  
 Lygia Clark‘s 1960 Neo-Concretist aluminum sculpture
“Bicho” was one of just three Brazilian works in the evening
sale. Competition from at least four telephone bidders generated
a record price of 367,250 pounds, double the low estimate. The
previous auction high for Clark was the 59,000 euros ($79,600)
paid for another 1960s aluminum sculpture at a sale in Germany
in June 2006.  
 BRIC Visitors  
 “This was the first time that a cultural institution has
concentrated on the art of BRIC countries,’’ Simon de Pury,
chairman of Phillips, said in an interview after the auction.
“Putting a sale together like a museum show definitely created
excitement.’’ The week-long viewing had attracted 2,500 visitors
a day, said de Pury.  
 India was the one country of the quartet to attract patchy
bidding. Four out of eight Indian lots failed, with Subodh
Gupta’s trademark 2006 painting of metal pots and pans, “Idol
Thief 1,” estimated at 320,000 pounds to 380,000 pounds, the
most prominent unsold. Two similar paintings by Gupta sold at
auction for $1.4 million and $1.2 million respectively in 2008,
according to the database Artnet.
