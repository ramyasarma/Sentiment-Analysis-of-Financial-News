             Eni SpA, Italy’s largest oil and
gas company, said first-quarter adjusted net income advanced 3.6
percent, beating analyst estimates, after production increased
and crude prices climbed.  
 Profit excluding one-time items and gains or losses from
inventories rose to 1.82 billion euros ($2.4 billion) from 1.76
billion euros a year earlier, Rome-based Eni said today in a
statement. That compares with the average estimate of 1.74
billion euros in a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts.  
 The exploration and production division reported “an
excellent operating performance driven by increased oil prices
and production growth,” the company said. “Eni forecasts a
modest improvement in global oil demand.”  
 Chief Executive Officer Paolo Scaroni is seeking oil
ventures abroad to increase output after crude prices rebounded
from their slump in the second half of 2008. Eni is expanding in
Venezuela, where it plans to develop $18 billion of projects,
and Iraq, where it will spend about $1 billion a year with
partners to boost production at the Zubair field.  
 Eni rose 0.9 percent to 17.67 euros in Milan trading today.
The stock has slipped 0.7 percent this year, valuing the company
at 70.8 billion euros.  
 Dividend Payout  
 When Eni starts preparing its next four-year plan in
September or October, it will “retain the option to change the
scenario assumptions and rebase the dividend,” Chief Financial
Officer Alessandro Bernini said today on a conference call. “We
already have given a guidance to pay a dividend in 2010 of 1
euro,” he said.  
 First-quarter production rose 2.1 percent to 1.816 million
barrels of oil equivalent a day, helped by projects in Nigeria
and the U.S. Eni said March 12 that output will grow at an
average annual rate of more than 2 percent until 2016, having
previously forecast 3.5 percent growth through 2012. Output will
exceed 2 million barrels a day in 2013, company estimates show.  
 Investment in the exploration and production division will
rise as Eni looks for new projects in Africa, it said. Capital
spending this year will be “broadly in line” with 2009, with a
focus on developing reserves, exploration projects and upgrading
rigs and gas-transport infrastructure, according to the
statement. Eni plans to invest 52.8 billion euros through 2013.  
 The company intends to boost international natural-gas
sales and to have more than 22 percent of Europe’s gas market by
2013. Gas sales fell 5.7 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, hurt by lower supplies to the Italian market.  
 Refining Slump  
 The company’s refining division has seen processing margins
squeezed as the economic slowdown eroded demand for fuels. The
global indicator Brent refining margin narrowed to $2.40 a
barrel in the quarter from $5.34 a barrel a year earlier, Eni
said. Last month the company said refining would return to
profit in 2012 on higher sales and increased efficiency.  
 “The company faces a challenging refining environment,
excluding any significant recovery in industry fundamentals,
which will result in prolonged weakness in refinery margins,”
Eni said today.
