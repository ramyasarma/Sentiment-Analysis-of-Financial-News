             Mexico’s benchmark peso bonds
posted the biggest weekly gain in more than a year after
consumer prices unexpectedly fell in the first half of April.  
 The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bond due December 2024
fell 22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, to 7.62 percent
this week, according to Banco Santander SA. The price rose 2.19
centavos since April 16 to 120.90 centavos. The yield declined
two basis points today to the lowest level since Jan. 23, 2009.  
 “Inflation was way below what was expected,” said Julio
Ramirez, head trader for Vector Casa de Bolsa in Mexico City.
“The country’s recovery is also taking hold, so I think people
are looking at places where there are high yields, like
Mexico.”  
 Mexican consumer prices unexpectedly declined 0.31 percent
in the first half of April, reinforcing forecasts the central
bank may hold off on raising interest rates until 2011.  
 Ramirez said Mexican bonds were already rising this week
before yesterday’s inflation report because of the securities’
inclusion in Citigroup Inc.’s World Government Bond Index on
March 31, and signs Mexico’s economy is recovering after
contracting 6.5 percent last year.  
 Rafael Camarena, an economist with Banco Santander SA in
Mexico City, said the more optimistic outlook for Mexico has
motivated foreign investors and local pension funds to increase
fixed-income positions.  
 The International Monetary Fund this week raised its 2010
growth forecast for Mexico to 4.2 percent from 4 percent.  
 Mexico’s peso rose 0.3 percent to 12.1795 per U.S. dollar
today, from 12.21 yesterday. The currency has strengthened 0.8
percent this week and is the best performer against the dollar
so far this year among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
strengthening 7.5 percent.  
 Traders triggered $5 million in dollar options on April 21,
exhausting all $600 million in options the central bank offered
this month. The bank has been auctioning the options monthly to
boost foreign reserves after the peso fell to a record low last
year.
