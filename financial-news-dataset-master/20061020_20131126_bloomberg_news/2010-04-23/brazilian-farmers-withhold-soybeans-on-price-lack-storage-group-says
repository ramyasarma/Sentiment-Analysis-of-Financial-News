             Soybean farmers in Brazil, the
world’s second-largest producer of the oilseed, are withholding
supplies as a currency rally erodes export profits, leading to a
“serious” storage shortage, the head of Latin America’s largest
farm cooperative said.  
 “Warehouses are completely full, and we had to rent every
facility around to store the crop,” Jose Aroldo Gallassini,
chief executive officer of Coamo Agroindustrial Cooperativa,
said today in a telephone interview from Campo Mourao, Brazil.  
 Coamo members will vote May 14 on a proposed 110 million-
real ($62.4 million) investment to expand storage capacity to
3.7 million metric tons, from 2.9 million now, he said. The
cooperative plans to pay for the investment with cash and seek a
10-year loan from Brazil’s BNDES development bank.  
 Brazil’s real has rallied 25 percent in the past year, the
third-best performance of the 16 most-traded currencies tracked
by Bloomberg. The stronger real is eroding profits on soybean
exports. The price of New York-traded soybean futures in local-
currency terms has plunged 22 percent in the past year.  
 Coamo had to rent additional warehouses this year to store
800,000 tons of soybeans, almost twice as much as in 2009,
Gallassini said. Farmers also were forced to assemble “pools,”
which are temporary storage units with walls made of soybean
bags that are filled with the oilseed, he said.  
 Coamo’s 22,150 members harvested 3.1 million tons of the
oilseed this year, up 41 percent from 2009. The U.S. is the
world’s largest soybean producer.
