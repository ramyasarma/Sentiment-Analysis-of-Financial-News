             Eritrea rejected a demand from the
U.S. military to have a base in the Red Sea port of Assab, the
eastern African nation’s president Isaias Afeworki said in an
interview with the newspaper Gulf News.  
 The U.S. made the request about a year after the attacks of
9/11, 2001, he said, according to the Dubai-based daily. Eritrea
rejected the demand so as not to become a “tool in the hands of
the Western military command,” he said.
