             Prime Minister Gordon Brown said
that if Goldman Sachs Group Inc. broke the law then compensation
will be owed to British banks and the U.K. government.  
 “If what happened at Goldman Sachs and in any other bank
is proven to be wrong, then hundreds of millions of dollars in
compensation should be paid to the British banks and, because we
are the biggest shareholder in many of them, to the British
taxpayer,” Brown said in a speech on a campaign visit to
Coventry, central England, today before the election on May 6.  
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs on April 16, alleging that the bank created and sold
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing to buyers that hedge fund Paulson & Co.
helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle.  
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc paid $841 million to
Goldman Sachs to unwind its position after taking over ABN Amro
in 2007, according to the SEC. The Edinburgh-based lender is 84
percent-owned by the British government after receiving a 45.5
billion-pound ($70 billion) taxpayer rescue, the world’s biggest
banking bailout.  
 The U.K. government also has a 41 percent stake in Lloyds
Banking Group Plc.
