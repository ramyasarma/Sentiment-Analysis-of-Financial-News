             Gold futures may fall in New York
on speculation that Greece’s request for funding aid will curb
demand from investors seeking an alternative to debt.  
 Greece asked for as much as 45 billion euros ($60 billion)
in loans from the European Union and International Monetary Fund
to help the government stave off a default. Gold has climbed 4.1
percent this year as some investors bought bullion as a hedge
against declines in other assets including debt and currencies.  
 “Certainly the immediate high-wave concerns regarding
Greece are now in calmer waters,” said Bayram Dincer, a
commodity analyst at LGT Capital Management in Pfaeffikon,
Switzerland. “Gold prices should trend lower.”  
 Gold for June delivery dropped 60 cents to $1,142.30 an
ounce at 8:13 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices are up 0.5
percent this week. Bullion for immediate delivery climbed 30
cents to $1,141.80 an ounce.  
 Gold assets of ETF Securities in London and Zurich rose 0.1
percent yesterday to 7.65 million ounces, the highest since
March 15. The metal traded in Swiss francs and in euros is near
its record highs of April 9.  
 Silver for delivery in July dropped 0.3 percent to $17.99
an ounce on the Comex. Platinum for July delivery fell 0.4
percent to $1,737.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and palladium declined 0.9 percent to $560.20 an ounce.
