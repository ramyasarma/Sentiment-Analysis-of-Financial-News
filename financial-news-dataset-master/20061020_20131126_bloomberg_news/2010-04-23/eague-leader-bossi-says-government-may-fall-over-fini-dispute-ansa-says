             Northern League leader Umberto
Bossi said divisions with ruling coalition ally Gianfranco Fini
are likely to bring down the Italian government, Ansa news
agency reported, citing an interview Bossi gave to his party’s
newspaper.  
 “We are facing the vertical collapse of the government and
probably of the alliance between the People of Liberty party and
the League,” Bossi was quoted as saying in Padania, according to
Ansa. “Fini, invidious and rancorous over our repeated victories,
has reneged on the original pact and has done nothing but
continously erode everything we have built.”  
 Bossi said Silvio Berlusconi, who yesterday called for
Fini’s resignation as Chamber of Deputies speaker, should have 
kicked Fini out of the party. Fini has criticized Berlusconi’s 
handling of issues including changes to the judicial system, 
economic policy and Berlusconi’s ruling style.
