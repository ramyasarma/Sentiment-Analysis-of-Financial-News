             U.S. stocks erased gains as
declines in telephone companies, drugmakers and consumer-staples
providers offset advances in commodity producers and
homebuilders.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,207.72 at 10:36 a.m. in New York after climbing as
much as 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.37
points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,139.66.
