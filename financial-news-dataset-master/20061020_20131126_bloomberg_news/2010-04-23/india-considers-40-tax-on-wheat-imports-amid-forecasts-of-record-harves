             India, the world’s second-biggest
wheat grower, is considering a 40 percent tax on overseas
purchases to prevent cheaper imports amid forecasts of a record
harvest for a second year.  
 The food ministry has proposed the duty on imports, an
official with direct knowledge of the matter said, declining to
be identified as he’s not authorized to speak to the media. The
proposal has been sent to a panel of ministers on food grains,
the official said.  
 India’s wheat output may reach a record 82 million metric
tons, up from 80.68 million tons last year, S.S. Singh, head of
the state-run Directorate of Wheat Research, said last week. The
crop hasn’t been damaged by a heat wave, S. Ayyappan, director-
general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, said in
New Delhi today.  
 Indian wheat growers have started gathering their crops,
adding to local stockpiles that are more than four times the
minimum needed to cope with emergencies. A bumper harvest will
help the government buy a record 26 million tons from farmers
this marketing year to sell grains at cheap rates to the poor.  
 Wheat for July delivery fell as much as 0.9 percent to
$5.06 a bushel in New York today. The grain has declined 5.8
percent this year.
