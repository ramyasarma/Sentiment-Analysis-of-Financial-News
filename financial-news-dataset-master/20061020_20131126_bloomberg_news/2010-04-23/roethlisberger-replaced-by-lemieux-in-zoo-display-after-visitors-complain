             Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s
name won’t be seen in the Pittsburgh Steelers’ early season
lineup or at the city’s zoo.  
 Roethlisberger’s name was removed from a sign on a totem
pole at the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium this week and replaced
by that of Pittsburgh Penguins Hall of Fame player and Chairman
Mario Lemieux. The pole is used to show visitors the height of a
growing elephant compared with humans.  
 Two days ago, Roethlisberger was suspended for six games
without pay for violating the National Football League’s
personal-conduct policy after being accused twice of sexual
assault. His penalty could be reduced to four games depending
upon his conduct before the season, which begins in September,
league Commissioner Roger Goodell said.  
 “We had had some calls from our members and visitors
concerning the recent situation with Ben,” Tracy Gray, a
spokeswoman for the zoo, said in a telephone interview,
confirming the initial report by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.  
 Lemieux, a co-owner of the National Hockey League’s
Penguins, was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997. He
won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL’s most valuable player
in 1988, 1993 and 1996.
