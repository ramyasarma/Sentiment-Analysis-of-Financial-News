             Copper was little changed in Asia,
heading for a second weekly decline, as the outlook for demand
dimmed after China moved to rein in property speculation and
Greece prepared to ask euro-region governments for a loan.  
 The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was at $7,683 a metric ton at 2:49 p.m. in Singapore,
after gaining as much as 0.9 percent earlier. The contract is
down 1 percent this week after China ordered developers not to
take deposits for sales of uncompleted apartments without
proper approval and clamped down on loans for third-home
purchases to cool rising prices.  
 Futures also pared gains as the dollar climbed to the
highest level in almost a year against the euro ahead of a
meeting between Group of 20 finance ministers today to discuss
Greece’s deficit. Dollar-denominated commodities tend to move
inversely to the U.S. currency.  
 “Optimism about the global economic recovery and its
implications for higher consumption has already been priced
into the market,” Zhang Tao, an analyst at Cinda Futures Co.,
said from Zhejiang. “There still exists many problems that
will keep a lid on prices, including high inventory levels,
ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and China’s moves
to cool growth.”  
 Copper consumption in China, may rise 8 percent to 6.05
million tons this year, Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co. said yesterday. The state researcher joins CRU
International Ltd. and Xstrata Plc in predicting higher usage
this year in the world’s largest metals consumer.  
 Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange have
surged 95 percent this year, and stood at 185,895 tons last
week, the highest level since at least 2003. Inventories
tallied by the London Metal Exchange are more than double the
level before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed in
September 2008.  
 Aluminum fell 0.3 percent to $2,314 a ton, zinc lost 0.8
percent to $2,399.50 a ton, and lead slid 0.4 percent to $2,299
a ton. Nickel shed 0.9 percent to $26,850 a ton, and tin hadn’t
traded.
