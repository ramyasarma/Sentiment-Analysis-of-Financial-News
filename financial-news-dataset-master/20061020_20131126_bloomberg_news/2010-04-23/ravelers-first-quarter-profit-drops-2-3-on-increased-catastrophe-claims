             Travelers Cos., the property
insurer added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year,
said first-quarter profit dropped 2.3 percent as the cost of
catastrophe claims increased more than fivefold.  
 Net income fell to $647 million, or $1.25 a share, from
$662 million, or $1.11, in the same period a year earlier, the
New York-based insurer said today in a statement. Operating
income, which excludes some investment results, was $1.22 a
share, missing the $1.38 average estimate of 19 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Travelers, led by Chief Executive Officer Jay Fishman, 57,
is competing for business with Chubb Corp. and American
International Group Inc. as demand for commercial coverage drops
and industry rates decline. At the same time, insurers face
claims from first-quarter catastrophe damage including record
rainfall in the U.S. Northeast.  
 “Weather had a big impact on our results,” said Brian
MacLean, chief operating officer, in a conference call today.
Travelers faced “a very active catastrophe quarter.”  
 The insurer slipped 41 cents to $53.38 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company gained 33
percent in the past 12 months, compared with the 41 percent
advance in the 30-company Dow benchmark.  
 Travelers earned 3.6 cents per each premium dollar in the
first three months of 2010, compared with 9.4 cents in the same
period last year on the higher catastrophe costs. Premium
revenue dropped about 1.3 percent to $5.2 billion from $5.3
billion.  
 Catastrophe Costs  
 Travelers had catastrophe costs of $471 million before
taxes, compared with $83 million a year earlier. Storms broke
rainfall marks in New York City, Boston and Providence, Rhode
Island, last month. Hundreds of people fled their homes as
rivers and drains backed up and President Barack Obama declared
parts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts disaster areas.  
 First-quarter catastrophe costs also included losses from a
February earthquake in Chile. The 8.8 magnitude quake, along
with the accompanying tsunami, killed at least 486 people,
toppled bridges, downed power lines and smashed factories.  
 The insurer’s book value, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, rose 1.8 percent to $53.50 per share from $52.54 at
the end of 2009. The company raised its dividend 9.1 percent to
36 cents from 33 cents. The dividend increase is the second in
the past half year, after Fishman maintained a 30-cent payout
for six straight quarters in the depths of the financial crisis.  
 Private Equity  
 Investment income advanced 29 percent to $610 million after
taxes as Travelers’ non-fixed income holdings, primarily private
equity, returned $44 million, the company said in a presentation
on its Web site. Last year, the investment group that includes
leveraged-buyout and hedge funds and real estate partnerships
had a $113 million loss in the first quarter.  
 The LBO market, where acquirers purchase companies using
mostly debt financing, is recovering after collapsing in 2007
when underwriters got stuck with $200 billion of loans they
couldn’t sell as credit markets froze.  
 Travelers pulled $294 million from reserves before taxes,
up from $258 million in the year-earlier period, as the insurer
again lowered the amount it estimated it would need to pay
claims from past quarters. That trend contrasts with AIG, which
posted a fourth-quarter loss after having to boost reserves.  
 Travelers repurchased 27 million shares in the first
quarter for $1.4 billion. The insurer bought back $3.3 billion
of shares in 2009 and said in January it expects to repurchase
as much as $4 billion this year.  
 ‘A Terrific Bite’  
 Travelers has increased prices for renewing commercial
policies to protect revenue as businesses cut jobs and
worksites, reducing the need for coverage. Industrywide, U.S.
property and casualty insurance sales dropped the most in five
decades last year, according to the Property Casualty Insurers
Association of America. Policy sales fell 3.7 percent to $419
billion, a third straight annual decline.  
 “The recession cut into many of the drivers of premium,
things like retail sales, payrolls, the number of autos that get
sold,” said Michael Murray, an assistant vice president for
financial analysis at Verisk Analytics Inc. who collaborated on
the study. “The recession took a terrific bite out of the
demand for insurance.”  
 The insurer said it raised renewal rates in its three
business segments in the first quarter. Industry rates for U.S.
commercial insurance fell 5.3 percent in the first quarter and
have dropped each quarter since 2004, according to the Council
of Insurance Agents and Brokers.
