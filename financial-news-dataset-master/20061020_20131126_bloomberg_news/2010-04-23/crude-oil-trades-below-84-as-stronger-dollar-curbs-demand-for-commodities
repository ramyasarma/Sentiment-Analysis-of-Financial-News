             Crude oil traded little changed,
erasing earlier losses as the dollar gave up gains against the
euro, making commodities more appealing to investors, and
equities rose.  
 Oil rebounded as the euro rose from the lowest in almost a
year against the U.S. currency. A weaker dollar encourages
investors to buy oil as an inflation hedge.  
 “The euro-dollar relationship is driving crude prices,”
said Hannes Loacker, an analyst at Raiffeisen Zentralbank
Oesterreich in Vienna. “Rallying stock markets should also be
quite supportive for oil and OPEC should deliver slightly less
in May.”  
 Crude oil for June delivery was at $83.64 a barrel, down 6
cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 12:09 p.m. London time. Yesterday the contract rose 2 cents
to settle at $83.70. Futures, which lost 2 percent last week,
are little changed this week.  
 Brent crude oil for June settlement was up 25 cents at
$85.92 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Yesterday, the contract declined 3 cents to end the session at
$85.67. Brent is trading at a premium of $2.28 a barrel to New
York oil futures, compared with a discount of $1.21 a month
earlier.  
 The dollar pared gains against the 16-nation euro after
earlier rising to the highest in almost a year. The U.S.
currency was at $1.3306 at 12:10 p.m. in London after reaching
$1.3202 per euro, the strongest rate since April 30, 2009.  
 “Cheap money and investors’ hunger for yields are keeping
oil prices at an exaggerated level at the moment,” said Carsten
Fritsch, a Commerzbank AG analyst in Frankfurt. “The only
positive factor that I can find is the reported decline in OPEC
shipments, the first in six weeks, but this is due to refinery
maintenance.”  
 OPEC Shipments  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut
crude shipments as Asian refiners shut plants to carry out work,
tanker tracker Oil Movements said yesterday.  
 OPEC, whose 12 members pump 40 percent of the world’s
crude, will ship 23.25 million barrels a day in the four weeks
to May 8, according to the Halifax, England-based consultant.
That’s the first reported decline since the month ended March
20. The data excludes Ecuador and Angola.  
 OPEC slashed production by a record 4.2 million barrels a
day beginning January 2009 to prevent a supply glut as the
global economy sank into recession. Group members left official
output quotas unchanged when ministers met March 17 in Vienna.  
 Oil may fall next week as U.S. inventories gain and fuel
consumption declines, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Twenty-two of 49 analysts and traders, or 45 percent,
forecast prices will decline through April 30. Seventeen
respondents, or 35 percent, predicted futures will increase and
10 said the market will be little changed. Last week, 44 percent
of analysts said prices would rise.
