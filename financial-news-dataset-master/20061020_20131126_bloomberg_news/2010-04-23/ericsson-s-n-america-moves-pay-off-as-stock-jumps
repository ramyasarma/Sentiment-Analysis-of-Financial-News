             Ericsson AB, the world’s largest
maker of wireless phone networks, rose the most in 15 months in
Stockholm trading after reporting first-quarter North American
revenue doubled.  
 Ericsson gained as much as 6.7 kronor, or 8.3 percent, to
86.5 kronor, the biggest intraday jump since Jan. 21, 2009, and
was up 7 percent as of 1:42 p.m. The stock has increased 30
percent this year.  
 Carriers on mobile networks in North America need to
upgrade to handle traffic from smartphones and other new
devices, Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg told journalists
at company headquarters in the Stockholm suburb of Kista.
Revenue in the region jumped after Ericsson bought a wireless
unit in the breakup of Nortel Networks Corp. and won a network-
management contract from Sprint Nextel Corp.  
 “The U.S. operations were truly strong, even adjusting for
the Nortel acquisition,” said Daniel Djurberg, a Stockholm-
based analyst with Nordea Bank AB.  
 Ericsson is betting that increased use of Internet-enabled
devices such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone handset will fuel continued
growth in wireless networks. The U.S., where Apple introduced
its iPad tablet last month, will probably struggle with
continued capacity strain, according to analysts.  
 “There is customer pressure in North America resulting
from lots of new phones, such as smartphones, coming onto the
market,” Vestberg said in an interview after the briefing.
“Ericsson has also improved its position considerably in that
market.”  
 Growth vs Decline  
 Revenue in North America rose 99 percent from a year
earlier to 9.5 billion kronor ($1.3 billion), holding back the
decline in global sales to 9 percent. The region is now
Ericsson’s biggest market.  
 In addition to the seven-year contract with Overland Park,
Kansas-based Sprint Nextel, Ericsson has agreements to supply
equipment for Verizon Wireless’s and Dallas-based AT&T Inc.’s
fourth-generation wireless networks as well as AT&T’s fixed-line
phone network.  
 AT&T, which sells the iPhone, uses a WCDMA-standard network
based on earlier GSM technology used by mobile-phone operators
in Europe. Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel’s mobile networks
are based on CDMA, a competing standard used by the division
acquired from Nortel.  
 “The growth in data is fueling also CDMA markets,”
Vestberg said on a conference call. “So there’s no difference
between CDMA and WCDMA in North America at the moment.”
