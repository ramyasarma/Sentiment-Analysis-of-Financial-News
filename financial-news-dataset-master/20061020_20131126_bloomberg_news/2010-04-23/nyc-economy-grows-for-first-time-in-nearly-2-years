             New York City’s economy expanded
for the first time in almost two years in the fourth quarter of
2009, beginning a recovery that is likely to be “slow and
fragile,” Comptroller John Liu said.  
 Gross city product, an estimate of all goods and services
produced, rose 0.9 percent between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, ending
seven-straight quarterly declines, according to economic notes
released today by Liu. Sales-tax receipts rose for the first
time in a year after a rate increase in August.  
 “The end of 2009 provided a much needed, albeit small,
boost to our city’s anemic economy,” Liu said today in a
statement. “Although economic growth should continue, the
recovery is expected to be slow and fragile.”  
 The U.S. economy expanded for the second-straight quarter
at the end of 2009, with gross domestic product rising at an
annual rate of 5.6 percent in the last three months of the year.
The city’s output was estimated at $602 billion for 2009, or
about 4.2 percent of the national total, the report said.  
 Employment in the city increased by 37,100 jobs in the
first quarter of 2010, according to the report. The unemployment
rate declined to 10.2 percent in the first three months of the
year, compared with 10.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  
 Income taxes withheld from paychecks dropped 6.4 percent to
about $1.3 billion in the final three months of 2009, compared
with a year earlier. Withholdings rose 7.1 percent in the first
quarter of 2010 from a year earlier. For all of 2009, personal-
income taxes fell almost 11 percent, the figures show.  
 ‘Restrained’ Bonuses  
 The increase indicated that “financial firms were
restrained in awarding cash bonuses, despite the strong recovery
in industry profits,” according to the report.  
 The vacancy rate for Manhattan office space rose to
11.6 percent in the first quarter, based on data from Cushman &
Wakefield Inc., a commercial real estate company. The rate
increased to 10 percent in Downtown and 12.6 percent in Midtown.  
 The number of Manhattan apartments sold almost doubled to
2,384 in the first quarter, from 1,195 a year earlier, according
to the report, citing figures from broker Prudential Douglas
Elliman Real Estate. The average price fell 18 percent for
condos and 6.2 percent for co-op units, based on cost for each
square foot of floor space.  
 The average weekday ridership on city transit fell less
than 1 percent in January from a year earlier, following a
1.4 percent drop in the fourth quarter. Average weekday subway
ridership rose about 1 percent in January, based on Metropolitan
Transit Authority data, according to the report.
