             A Southwest Airlines Co. jet
carrying 124 people came as close as 200 feet to a small
aircraft while landing at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank,
California, a U.S. safety board said today.  
 The Boeing Co. 737-700 flying from Oakland, California,
came within 200 feet vertically and 10 feet laterally of a
departing Cessna that flew above it April 19, the National
Transportation Safety Board said in a statement in Washington.  
 No one was injured in the incident at the intersection of
two runways, which occurred at 10:58 a.m. local time, according
to the NTSB, which is conducting an investigation.  
 “We are working closely with the NTSB in support of their
investigation and look forward to learning more about this
situation,” said Brandy King, a spokeswoman for Dallas-based
Southwest. “Because it is an open investigation, we cannot
comment further at this time.”  
 Curtailing near misses at airports has been a top priority
of aviation regulators and safety advocates. The number of the
most serious types of near-misses dropped to 12 in the year
ended Sept. 30, from 25 in fiscal 2008, the Federal Aviation
Administration said in October.  
 The FAA recorded 24 or more total near misses in each of
the nine fiscal years prior to 2009, with a high of 67 in 2000.
