             Xerox Corp., the largest maker of
high-speed color printers, jumped the most in nine months in New
York trading after its second-quarter profit forecast beat
analysts’ estimates.  
 Per-share profit this quarter, excluding some costs, will
be at least 20 cents, Xerox said today in a statement. That
compares with the 18-cent average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. First-quarter earnings and sales also exceeded
analysts’ projections.  
 Customers are spending more on services to help them manage
documents, after curbing budgets during the recession. The
rebound, plus a sales boost from the purchase of Affiliated
Computer Services Inc., helped Xerox increase sales 33 percent
last quarter. Xerox also said today that full-year profit will
be at the high end of its forecast.  
 The earnings report was the first since Chief Executive
Officer Ursula Burns completed the $6 billion acquisition of
ACS, the largest in Xerox’s history. She aims to transform the
printer and copier company into a bigger provider of office-
support services. Investors needed assurance that cost savings -
-a big selling point for the deal -- are under way, said
Deutsche Bank’s Chris Whitmore.  
 “The business isn’t being hit by the transaction,” said the
San Francisco-based analyst, who rates the shares “hold” and
doesn’t own them. “That gives people some confidence.”  
 Cost Savings  
 Xerox said it’s on track to save at least $100 million this
year, as projected, and the number may climb to $150 million,
the high end of its forecast. The company announced 2,500 job
cuts last quarter, leading to an additional $140 million in
savings.  
 “We tried to put out conservative estimates,” Chief
Financial Officer Larry Zimmerman said in an interview. “We’ll
have to see how it goes, but we’re certainly confident we’re
going to get the $100 million.”  
 Xerox, based in Norwalk, Connecticut, rose 87 cents, or 8.3
percent, to $11.32 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, the biggest increase since July 23.  
 The first-quarter loss was $42 million, or 4 cents a share,
compared with net income of $42 million, or 5 cents, a year
earlier. Excluding restructuring and other costs, profit was 18
cents a share, topping the average analyst estimate of 13 cents.
Sales climbed to $4.72 billion from $3.55 billion a year
earlier.  
 The company had previously forecast full-year profit of 75
cents to 85 cents. Analysts on average estimated 79 cents,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 Shares Rebound  
 Burns, 51, took over as CEO in July, when Anne Mulcahy
stepped down after eight years at the helm. Burns announced the
ACS deal less than three months later, to build Xerox’s services
business amid declining sales of printing equipment. ACS handles
accounting, benefits and other administrative tasks for
corporations.  
 After the stock dropped 15 percent the day the deal was
announced, Burns spent the next five months convincing investors
that it could boost services sales and take out costs. When the
deal closed Feb. 8, shares had climbed most of the way back, up
10 percent compared with a decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500
in the same period. Xerox has gained 34 percent this year.
