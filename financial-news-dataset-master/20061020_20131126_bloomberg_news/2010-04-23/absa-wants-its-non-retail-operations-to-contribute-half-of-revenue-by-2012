             (Corrects Von Zeuner’s title in headline, first paragraph.)  
 Absa Group Ltd., South Africa’s
third-largest bank, wants its non-retail operations to
contribute half of group revenue by 2012, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Louis von Zeuner said.  
 The Johannesburg-based lender last year earned 61 percent
of its revenue from retail operations, Von Zeuner said in an
interview with the Business Day newspaper today. The bank plans
to grow its corporate and investment banking divisions over the
next three years, he said.
