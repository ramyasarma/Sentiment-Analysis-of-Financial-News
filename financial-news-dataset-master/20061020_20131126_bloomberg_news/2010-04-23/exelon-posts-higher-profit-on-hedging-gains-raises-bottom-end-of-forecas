             Exelon Corp., the biggest U.S.
utility owner by market value, cut its earnings outlook for 2012
after posting a gain in first-quarter net income on hedging
contracts that protected against slumping power prices.  
 Profit rose to $749 million, or $1.13 a share, from $712
million, or $1.08, a year earlier, Chicago-based Exelon said
today in a statement. Excluding such items as the hedging gains,
per-share profit dropped to $1.20 from $1. Revenue fell 5.5
percent to $4.46 billion.  
 Exelon will have less protection from declining prices in
the years ahead. The company said it has prices locked in on
about half of its expected production in 2012, down from as much
as 98 percent this year. Gross margin, a profit measure that
shows revenue minus certain costs, will fall 17 percent to $4.8
billion in 2012, according to slides for a presentation that
Exelon will give today on its earnings conference call.  
 “A key issue going forward will be what the power-price
environment will be when the company’s comparatively favorable
hedges roll off, and right now the forward curve is pointing to
a difficult environment,” said Paul Patterson, an analyst at
Glenrock Associates LLC in New York.  
 Exelon rose 30 cents to $43.95 as of the 4 p.m. close of
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock fell as
much as 2 percent after the earnings statement was released this
morning, before a report on U.S. home sales pushed energy shares
higher. All but three of 14 electric utility companies in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 advanced.  
 Prices Fall  
 Adjusted first-quarter profit of $1 a share was 10 cents
higher than the average of 14 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Exelon said it may earn 80 to 90 cents a share in the
second quarter. The average analyst estimate is 92 cents.  
 Wholesale power prices, which have dropped from a year
earlier for six straight quarters, are no longer declining from
one period to the next.  
 Prices in PJM Interconnection LLC, the largest U.S. power
market, averaged $49.51 per megawatt-hour during the first
quarter. While the average was down 10 percent from a year
earlier, it climbed 14 percent from the fourth quarter. Prices
had tumbled after the recession eroded power demand.  
 Exelon, the biggest U.S. operator of nuclear power plants,
announced 500 job cuts in June and a freeze on executive pay. In
December, the company said it would shut four money-losing
generation units in Pennsylvania, eliminating 280 more jobs.  
 Recovering power prices may keep the company from having to
cut costs further, Exelon President Chris Crane said in a
February interview.  
 Exelon raised the bottom end of its full-year profit
forecast, saying it expects earnings per share excluding special
items to be in a range of $3.70 to $4. Exelon’s previous target
was $3.60 to $4.
