             Argentina’s trade surplus plunged
in March to the second-lowest in almost a decade as a strike by
dockworkers at the world’s largest grain exporting port complex
cut agricultural sales, the country’s statistics agency said.  
 Last month’s trade surplus narrowed 77 percent from a year
earlier to $311 million, the second-lowest since March 2001, the
agency reported today in Buenos Aires. Exports rose 11 percent
to $4.7 billion and imports climbed 52 percent to $4.4 billion.  
 A 10-day strike last month by dockworkers seeking higher
pay at ports near the city of Rosario blocked exports of
soybeans, corn and copper, crimping sales. Argentina is the
world’s third-biggest soybean exporter after the U.S. and
Brazil.  
 “This was a very surprising fall after we saw an almost 50
percent decline in February,” said Mauricio Claveri, an
economist at Buenos Aires-based research company Abeceb.com.
“If we don’t see strong growth in April, then we’ll have to
revise our estimates for the year.”  
 Argentina posted a record $16.9 billion trade surplus last
year.
