             Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Director 
Thomas Murphy talks with Bloomberg's Betty Liu about Berkshire 
Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett's investment in Goldman 
Sachs Group Inc. after the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission sued the bank for fraud.  
 Buffett injected $5 billion into Goldman Sachs in 2008, and
remains comfortable with his investment, Murphy said, citing a 
telephone conversation with Buffett. The SEC has accused Goldman
Sachs and an employee of misleading clients on the sale of 
mortgage-related investments. (Excerpts. Source: Bloomberg)
