             The Federal Reserve may raise
interest rates earlier than anticipated by Pacific Investment
Management Co. if the job market continues to strengthen,
according to Pimco strategist Anthony Crescenzi.  
 “There’s a lot of talk building up toward employment gains
that could make it possible the Fed could raise rates by the end
of the year,” Crescenzi said in an interview on Bloomberg
Radio. “The ‘extended period’ phrase is becoming more
conditional in terms of what could force the hand.”  
 Pimco, the world’s largest manager of bond funds, forecasts
that the Fed won’t increase its target rate for overnight loans
between banks until 2011 as unemployment declines on a
consistent basis. The Labor Department may say May 7 that the
U.S. added 175,000 jobs this month, after adding 162,000 in
March, according to the median estimate of 10 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The March employment report on April 2
showed U.S. companies added the most jobs in three years.  
 The Fed has kept its target rate in a range of zero to 0.25
percent since December 2008. It is scheduled to release the next
Federal Open Market Committee policy decision on April 28.  
 Policy makers will boost the rate by a 0.25 percentage
point by the end of the year, according to the median forecast
of 60 contributors in a Bloomberg survey.  
 “Cyclical tailwinds” may push the yield on the 10-year
note to 4 percent or higher, Crescenzi said. “The market
believes that in a year, the 10-year will be 4.25 percent.”  
 Treasury Auctions  
 The yield on the 10-year note rose 4 basis points to 3.81
percent and last exceeded 4 percent on April 5.  
 “As the economy improves, all auctions in the U.S. could
become more challenging,” Crescenzi said. “A strengthening
economy may result in an increase in yield demand because of the
supply.”  
 The Treasury said yesterday it will sell a record $129
billion of debt next week at four auctions beginning April 26.
The U.S. will sell $44 billion in two-year notes, $42 billion in
five-year securities, $32 billion in seven-year debt and $11
billion in five-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
