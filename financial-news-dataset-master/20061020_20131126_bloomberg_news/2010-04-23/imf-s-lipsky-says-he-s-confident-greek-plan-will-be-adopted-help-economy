             The International Monetary Fund’s
No. 2 official said he’s confident a plan to reduce Greece’s
budget deficit will be adopted, enabling the institution and
euro-area countries to send a financial lifeline.  
 “A coherent, multi-year economic program of adjustment is
being negotiated right now in Athens, will be agreed I believe,
I’m confident will be put in place, will receive the requisite
support that has been pledged,” John Lipsky said in an
interview today with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Radio. “It’s going
to take sustained effort over a period of time but I think we
can do it.”  
 Greece today activated the funding mechanism agreed by
euro-area nations earlier this month after a surge in borrowing
costs to what Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou called
unsustainable levels that undermine efforts to cut a budget
shortfall of more than four times the European Union limit.  
 The request for as much as 45 billion euros ($60 billion)
is an unprecedented test of the euro’s stability and European
political cohesion.  
 The euro “has been passing the test in the face of
skepticism” for “some time” and the authorities in the region
sharing the euro “are acting in a coordinated way, in an
unprecedented manner in support of Greece,” said Lipsky, the
IMF’s first deputy managing director.  
 In a statement earlier today, IMF Managing Director
Dominique Strauss-Kahn confirmed the institution had received
Greece’s request for help and is set to “move expeditiously.”  
 The IMF earlier this week cautioned that rising government
debt has replaced financial industry stress as the biggest
threat to the global economy, calling Greece’s fiscal crisis a
“wake-up call.”  
 Lipksy said Greek authorities have “grasped the
situation” and predicted the aid package will “create the
opportunity for a return to financial stability and economic
prosperity for the Greek economy and to diminish the possibility
and risk of contagion.”
