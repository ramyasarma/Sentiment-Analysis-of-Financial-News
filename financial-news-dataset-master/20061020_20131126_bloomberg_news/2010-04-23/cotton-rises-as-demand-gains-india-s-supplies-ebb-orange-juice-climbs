             Cotton rose, posting the biggest
weekly gain in two months, on signs of increasing demand amid a
halt in exports by India, the world’s second-largest shipper.
Orange juice also gained.  
 U.S. durable-goods orders, excluding transportation, jumped
in March by the most since December 2007, adding to evidence the
economic recovery is strengthening. The Cotton Association of
India said the nation’s export ban may affect as many as 2.5
million bales. Futures reached to a two-year high of 86.8 cents
a pound on April 21.  
 “The improving macroeconomic situation and India’s
decision not to export any cotton” drove prices higher, said
Robin Rosenberg, a futures strategist at PFG Best Research, a
brokerage in Chicago.  
 Cotton for July delivery rose 1.38 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to 86.2 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. This
week, the price climbed 5.7 percent, the most since mid-
February.  
 India’s cotton output will rise to a record 25 million
bales in the year starting Aug. 1 from an estimated 23.5 million
a year earlier, a U.S. Department of Agriculture unit said on
April 15.  
 “Extremely high U.S. exports” are also boosting prices,
Rosenberg said. The country is the top shipper.  
 Sales of upland cotton to overseas buyers in the week ended
April 15 jumped 24 percent to 347,100 running bales from a week
earlier, the USDA said yesterday. Futures have climbed 65
percent in the past year as global output dropped and demand
rebounded.  
 Orange-juice futures for July delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.7
percent, to $1.3695 a pound. This week, the price climbed 3.2
percent, the most since early March. The commodity has advanced
62 percent in the past year.
