             Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu met U.S. Middle East envoy George Mitchell in
Jerusalem as the Obama administration tries again to revive
peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.  
 Netanyahu said before today’s meeting that he was
“serious” about advancing the peace process and hoped “the
Palestinians respond,” according to an e-mailed statement from
his office. According to a later statement, the meeting was
“good” and the two will meet again on April 25.  
 Mitchell was to meet this evening in Ramallah with
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who demands
Israel freeze a plan to build 1,600 homes in east Jerusalem
before any talks. The area is part of the territory claimed by
Palestinians for a future state. The proposal was announced
during a March 9 visit by Vice President Joe Biden, complicating
U.S. efforts to promote peace negotiations and straining ties
between Israel and its staunchest ally.  
 Israel won’t agree to halt plans for the construction in
east Jerusalem as a condition for talks, Netanyahu reiterated in
an interview broadcast late yesterday on Israel’s Channel 2.  
 Before meeting Netanyahu, Mitchell stressed the strength of
the U.S.-Israeli relationship, describing it as a “strong
unbreakable bond of friendship” that is “anchored by the
United States’ enduring commitment to Israel’s security,”
according to the statement from the prime minister’s office.
