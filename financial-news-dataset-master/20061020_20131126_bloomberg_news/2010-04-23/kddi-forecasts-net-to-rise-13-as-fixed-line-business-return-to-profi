             KDDI Corp., Japan’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, forecast annual net income will increase
13 percent, helped by a return to profit at the fixed-line
business and after it booked a charge last year.  
 Net income will rise to 240 billion yen ($2.57 billion)
from 212.8 billion yen in the 12 months ended March 31, Tokyo-
based KDDI said today. The outlook falls short of the 253.5
billion yen average of four analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 The carrier, forecasting a profit decline in mobile-phone
operations, is looking to recovery of its fixed-line business to
help achieve profit targets this fiscal year. KDDI, which
invested about $3.9 billion in cable-television provider Jupiter
Telecommunications Co. to access more fixed-line customers, has
said it aims to make money from the business this fiscal year.  
 Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, will probably climb 0.3 percent from a
year earlier to 445 billion yen while revenue may fall 0.1
percent to 3.44 trillion yen, KDDI said. The analysts expected
463.8 billion yen income on 3.46 trillion yen in sales.  
 The shares fell 0.1 percent to close at 459,500 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange before the announcement. The benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.3 percent.  
 KDDI in February completed the purchase of Liberty Global
Inc.’s 37.8 percent holding in Jupiter for about 363 billion yen.
KDDI said its biggest-ever acquisition would allow it to provide
fixed-line service to as many as 3.3 million households without
renting rival Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.’s networks.  
 Fixed-Line Profit  
 KDDI’s fixed-line business comprising services over fiber
and copper cables will probably post a 10 billion yen profit
this fiscal year, compared with a 44.2 billion yen loss a year
earlier, the company said. Revenue will rise 12 percent to 940
billion yen.  
 The company booked a 61 billion yen charge last fiscal year
to consolidate some fixed-line network equipment and write down
unused gear, KDDI said. The carrier aims to expand its fiber-
optic cable subscriber base by a third to 20.4 million users in
the 12 months to March 2011 to help make the business profitable,
it said.  
 Annual profit in the mobile phone business will probably
fall 11 percent to 430 billion yen, as revenue declines 4
percent to 2.55 trillion yen, the company said. KDDI forecast
sales of mobile phones in the period will rise 3.9 percent to
10.6 million units.  
 Android Smartphones  
 KDDI, which lagged behind rival NTT DoCoMo Inc. and
Softbank Corp. in net user additions last fiscal year, will
introduce its first handset running Google Inc.’s Android
operating system in June to catch up. DoCoMo, Japan’s largest
mobile-phone operator, started selling its second Android model
earlier this month, while Softbank, Apple Inc.’s exclusive
provider of the iPhone in the country, will introduce its first
on April 27.  
 KDDI added 1.03 million net new mobile phone users last
fiscal year, less than the 1.47 million for DoCoMo and 1.24
million for Softbank, according to separate filings by the
carriers.  
 The company said it plans to raise its annual dividend to
13,000 yen for the year just ended, from 12,000 yen announced
earlier.
