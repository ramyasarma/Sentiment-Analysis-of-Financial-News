             The Philadelphia Flyers
reached the second round of the National Hockey League’s
Stanley Cup playoffs with a 3-0 shutout of the New Jersey
Devils.  
 Danny Briere scored just over three minutes into the
game and Claude Giroux has two goals in as many minutes in
the second period last night at Prudential Center in
Newark, New Jersey. Brian Boucher had 28 saves as
Philadelphia claimed the best-of-seven series 4-1.  
 At Mellon Arena in Pittsburgh, the Ottawa Senators
beat the defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins 4-3 in the
third overtime to force a sixth game. Matt Carkner scored
at 7:06 of the third overtime period to leave the Senators
trailing 3-2 in the series.  
 At Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, the Chicago
Blackhawks beat the Nashville Predators 3-0 to tie their
series at two games each.  
 In the night’s fourth game, Logan Couture scored twice
as the San Jose Sharks, the top seed in the Western
Conference, beat the Colorado Avalanche 5-0 to take a 3-2
lead in their series.
