             Eveready East Africa Ltd., a Kenyan
dry-cell battery manufacturer, said fiscal first-half profit
after-tax surged to 12.8 million shillings ($165,300) from
290,000 shillings a year earlier after the company cut its
overhead and financing costs.  
 Revenue fell 2 percent to 814.21 million shillings for the
six months through March, mainly due to currency fluctuations
within regional markets, which “negatively impacted” the
group’s ability to compete outside its home market, the Nairobi,
Kenya-based company said in a stock exchange statement today.  
 Zinc, used mainly to make batteries, more than doubled to
$2,375 in the year through March. Eveready “has therefore taken
a deliberate decision to buy some of the critical materials in
advance, which has lead to a 46 percent increase in stock
levels” compared with a year earlier, Chairman Moody Awori and
Managing Director Steven Smith said in the statement.  
 Eveready shares climbed as much as 8.1 percent to 4.7
shillings and traded 3.5 percent higher at 4.50 shillings as of
12:47 p.m., extending the gain this year to 55 percent.
