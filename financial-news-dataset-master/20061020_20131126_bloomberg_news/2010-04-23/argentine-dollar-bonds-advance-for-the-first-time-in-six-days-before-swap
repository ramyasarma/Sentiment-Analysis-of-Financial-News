             Argentine bonds advanced for the
first time in six days as global stock gains fueled investor
appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  
 The yield on Argentina’s 7 percent dollar bonds due 2015
slid four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 11.76
percent at 4:28 p.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg
pricing data. The bond’s price rose 0.18 cent to 81.75 cents on
the dollar, after touching a six-week low yesterday.  
 Today’s gains halt a decline in Argentine debt that came
after Economy Minister Amado Boudou on April 15 unveiled the
general terms of the government’s plan to restructure $20
billion of defaulted bonds held out of a 2005 restructuring.
Argentina will offer investors 33.7 cents on the dollar for
securities due in 2033, warrants linked to economic growth and
pay past due interest with 8.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2017, Boudou said last week. The government will not include
past-due payments on the warrants.  
 “Until they effectively open the swap and we get an
indication of participation, the local bond market will follow
global markets,” said Noelia Lucini, a portfolio manager with
Capital Markets Argentina in Buenos Aires.  
 U.S. stocks climbed today, sending the S&P 500 Index up 0.7
percent, as the biggest jump in new home sales in almost five
decades bolstered optimism that the world’s biggest economy is
improving.  
 Argentine bond trading slowed in recent days as investors
waited for the government to open the exchange, Lucini said.

 Boudou told Buenos Aires-based Radio Mitre today that the
government is “advancing very well” as it seeks to obtain
final approval from regulators in Italy and Luxembourg.  
 The value of Argentina’s offer -- as measured in net-
present value terms -- is worth 52.3 cents on the dollar for
institutional investors, RBS Securities Inc. said in a report
this week.  
 The government says a settlement with remaining
creditors will help Argentina regain access to international
bond markets and bolster its credibility among investors nine
years after the default on $95 billion of debt.  
 The peso was little changed today at 3.8725 per dollar,
from 3.8715 yesterday. The currency slid 0.1 percent this week.
