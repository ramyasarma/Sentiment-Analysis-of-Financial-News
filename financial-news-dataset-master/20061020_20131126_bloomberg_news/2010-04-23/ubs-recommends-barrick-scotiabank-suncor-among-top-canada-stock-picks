             UBS AG today named Bank of Nova
Scotia, Barrick Gold Corp. and Suncor Energy Inc. to a new “Key
Call” list, saying they are investors’ best bets among Canadian
stocks in their industries over the next 12 to 18 months.  
 Scotiabank, the third-largest Canadian bank, stands out
from its peers because its international banking business may
lead to higher-than-estimated growth, analyst Peter Rozenberg
wrote in a note to UBS clients.  
 Analyst Brian MacArthur said Barrick, the world’s biggest
gold producer, may catch up with other gold companies as
“uncertainty” over new projects is resolved. The S&P/TSX Gold
Index has outgained Barrick, 20 percent to 12 percent, over the
past year.  
 Suncor, Canada’s largest oil and gas company, benefits from
a “powerful combination of above-average growth and free cash
flow” and stands to benefit as the cost of oil sands mining
decreases, analyst Matt Donohue wrote.  
 UBS also named Canadian Tire Corp., the biggest Canadian
hardware-store chain; Onex Corp., the country’s largest publicly
traded buyout firm; and Toronto Sun owner Quebecor Inc. to the
Key Call list.
