             London Marathon organizers spent
nearly 150,000 pounds ($230,000) on chartered flights to ensure
the top runners arrived for this weekend’s race.  
 Defending men’s champion Sammy Wanjiru was among 18 runners
landing in London yesterday from Madrid by charter following the
disruption of air travel by volcanic ash in Iceland last week.
The move was made to give the runners time to be ready for the
race in two days.  
 “In the end I think it was pretty good value for money,”
race director Dave Bedford said on the race’s Web site. “You
can’t put on an event without a contingency fund and the amount
we spent is well within that. For us, it’s all about maintaining
the quality of the event rather than bean counting.”  
 Wanjiru and world champion Abel Kirul were among six Kenyan
runners picked up in Nairobi by chart. The flight later picked
up runners in Eritrea before being met in Madrid by other
athletes from Europe and South America. The group then left via
a second airplane for the three-hour trip to London.  
 “I am not sure I would have been here if it wasn’t for
this flight,” women’s Olympic champion Constantina Dita, who
was coming from eastern Europe, said. “After all the
uncertainty, I want to be the best I can on Sunday.”  
 Wanjiru won last year’s 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race in
a time of two hours, five minutes and 10 seconds. Irina
Mikitenko of Germany won the women’s event for the second
straight year in 2:22.11.
