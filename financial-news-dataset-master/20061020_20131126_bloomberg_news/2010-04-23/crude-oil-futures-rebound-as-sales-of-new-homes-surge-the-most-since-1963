             Crude oil rose as the dollar fell
against the euro for the first time in seven days, bolstering
the appeal of commodities as an alternate investment.  
 Oil increased 1.7 percent on the euro’s strength after
Greece called for activation of a bailout package. Prices also
advanced after the government reported that sales of new homes
surged in the U.S. in March and orders for durable goods
excluding transportation climbed.  
 “The action of the dollar was enough to spur a rally in
commodities,” said Addison Armstrong, director of market
research at Tradition Energy, a Stamford, Connecticut-based
procurement adviser. “Oil often looks to the dollar for
direction. The durable goods orders, excluding transportation,
and housing numbers were exciting, which is helping as well.”  
 Crude oil for June delivery climbed $1.42 to $85.12 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since April 15. The June contract increased 0.5
percent this week. Futures are up 7.3 percent this year.  
 Brent crude oil for June settlement increased $1.58, or 1.8
percent, to end the session at $87.25 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Brent, usually cheaper than
contracts on the Nymex, is trading at a $2.13-a-barrel premium.  
 Greece asked the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund to activate a bailout of as much as 45 billion
euros ($60 billion). The Greek request needs approval from the
15 other euro-area countries including Germany, where surveys
have shown public opposition to aiding the country.  
 The dollar traded at $1.3377 per euro, down 0.6 percent
from $1.3295 yesterday. The greenback reached $1.3202 per euro,
the strongest rate since April 30, 2009.  
 Commodity Decline  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities climbed
0.7 percent to 279.05. Gold futures for June delivery increased
$10.80, or 0.9 percent, to settle at $1,153.70 an ounce on the
Comex in New York, the biggest gain since April 7.  
 The Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes in
the U.S. increased 27 percent, the most since April 1963, to an
annual pace of 411,000 that exceeded the highest forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “The housing numbers were very good, which has allowed the
bulls to take control of the market again,” said Jim
Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates, a Galena,
Illinois, consulting firm. “The housing data enhances risk
appetite, which is going to push prices higher.”  
 Durable Goods  
 Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years,
excluding cars and aircraft, climbed 2.8 percent last month, the
most since the recession began in December 2007, according to
the Commerce Department. The result was four times larger than
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “There has been a reassessment by the market of the
strength of the economic recovery,” said David Kirsch, an
Overland Park, Kansas-based analyst with PFC Energy, an energy
strategist to companies and governments. “We’re getting GDP
numbers next week and they are likely to be very strong, which
will add to the bullish tone of the market.”  
 The U.S. economy expanded at a 5.6 percent pace in the last
three months of 2009, the strongest rate of growth in six years.
A government report on April 30 is forecast to show that the
economy grew at a 3.4 percent rate in the first quarter of this
year, according to the median of economist responses in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 “It’s impossible to know what factor this market is going
to follow at any given second,” said Kyle Cooper, a managing
director at energy consultant IAF Advisors in Houston. “It can
be the stock market, the dollar, even the fundamentals on
occasion. One thing that’s sure is we aren’t anywhere near
running out of physical supply.”  
 U.S. Stockpiles  
 U.S. crude oil inventories rose 1.89 million barrels to
355.9 million in the week ended April 16, the 11th gain in 12
weeks, according to an Energy Department report on April 21.
Stockpiles of gasoline and distillate fuel, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, also increased last week.  
 “We are so well supplied that if there are any hiccups in
the demand picture a glut will form,” Kirsch said. “Under the
best of circumstances it will take some time to work off excess
supplies.”  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 570,323 contracts as of 3:17
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 804,755
contracts yesterday, 20 percent higher than the average of the
past three months. Open interest was 1.36 million contracts. The
exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open interest
and full volume data.
