             Deutsche Postbank AG rose to the
highest price since October 2008 in Frankfurt trading on
continued speculation that part-owner Deutsche Bank AG is
preparing a full takeover of the retail lender.  
 Postbank climbed 79.5 cents, or 3.1 percent, to close at
26.40 euros. The stock has rallied 10 percent over the past two
weeks amid the speculation, valuing the Bonn-based bank at about
5.8 billion euros ($7.8 billion).  
 “There is speculation that Deutsche Bank may pay 36 euros
to 37 euros per Postbank share, that it may be planning a
capital increase for this purpose and that it will carry out the
Postbank takeover in the near future,” Konrad Becker, an
analyst at Merck Finck & Co. in Munich who recommends selling
Postbank stock, said by telephone today.  
 Deutsche Bank spokesman Michael Lermer declined to comment.
The lender is under no time pressure to raise its almost 30
percent stake in Postbank, Chief Executive Officer Josef
Ackermann said on Feb. 4. Ackermann also said at the time the
Frankfurt-based bank may consider conducting a capital increase
for a “major” acquisition.  
 Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest bank, declined 19 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to 53.77 euros today.  
 “Deutsche Bank would need to make a takeover offer before
February 2011 and moving closer to this deadline will support”
Postbank shares, Thomas Stoegner, analyst at Macquarie Group
Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed report on April 19. He has an
“outperform” recommendation on Postbank.
