             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as rains in the U.S. Midwest
boost soil moisture for early crop development after planting
accelerated in the past two weeks, said Roy Huckabay, an
executive vice president at the Linn Group in Chicago.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents lower after
farmers in Brazil and Argentina increased sales of newly
harvested crops following a jump in prices this week, Huckabay
said. Soybean-meal futures may open 50 cents to $1.50 lower per
2,000 pounds and soybean oil may open 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a
pound higher.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as the dollar’s rally reduces the appeal of U.S.
exports, Huckabay said.  
 -- May options on the CBOT expire today with futures approaching
the $10 strike price in soybeans, $3.60 corn options and $5 puts
and calls on wheat, Huckabay said.
