             Singapore’s dollar is poised to
gain 1 percent against the Thai baht to its highest level in
almost three months, based on technical analysis cited by Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd.  
 An ichimoku chart, which gauges a currency’s direction and
future support and resistance levels, signals the Singapore
dollar will appreciate to 23.75 baht, the strongest since Feb. 1,
according to Hiroyuki Tanaka at Mizuho Corporate Bank.  
 The Singapore dollar yesterday rose above the green line on
the blue clouded area of the chart, breaking a resistance level
where sell orders were clustered. The next resistance indicated
by the chart is 23.75, Tanaka said.  
 “After breaking key technical levels, the Singapore dollar
seems to be on a solid upward trend against the baht,” he said
in Tokyo. “It looks pretty bullish now especially after passing
beyond the cloud.”  
 The Singapore dollar also advanced beyond its 100-day
moving average of 23.4724 against the baht yesterday, another
bullish signal, said Tanaka.  
 Singapore’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to 23.49 baht as of
12:16 p.m. in Singapore and reached 23.57, the highest level
since Feb. 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support levels indicate where
orders to buy a currency may be concentrated. A break of an area
of support or resistance signals a currency or security may move
to the next level on the chart.
