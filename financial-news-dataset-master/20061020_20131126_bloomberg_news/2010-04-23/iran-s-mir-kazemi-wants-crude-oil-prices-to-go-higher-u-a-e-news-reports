             Iran wants crude oil prices to be
higher than what they are now, the United Arab Emirates’s state-
run news agency Wam reported, citing Iranian Oil Minister Masoud
Mir-Kazemi.  
 Mir-Kazemi, speaking at a petroleum exhibition in Tehran,
said current oil prices are “unfair” to producers in view of
the increasing costs of extraction, according to Wam.
