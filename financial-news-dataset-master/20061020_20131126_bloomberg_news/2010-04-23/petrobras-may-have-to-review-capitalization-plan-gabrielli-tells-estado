             Petroleo Brasileiro SA may have to 
find another way to raise capital if a plan isn’t approved by 
Brazil’s congress by June, Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio 
Gabrielli told O Estado de S. Paulo in an interview.  
 The capitalization plan is likely to be voted on and sent 
to the lower house at the end of May and the process should be 
completed by June, the newspaper said, citing Gabrielli. The 
CEO said he won’t look at alternatives to the plan until 
congress makes a decision, Estado said.  
 The capital increase is important to maintain the company’s
“financial health,” Gabrielli told the paper. He said it 
would be “impossible” to meet the company’s investment plan 
without raising debt, according to the paper.  
 Petrobras, as the company is known, is seeking to sell 
shares to help finance as much as $220 billion of investment 
through 2014. As part of the plan, Rio de Janeiro-based 
Petrobras will swap some shares for the rights to 5 billion 
barrels of government-owned reserves.
