             Nippon Life Insurance Co., Japan’s
biggest life insurer, plans to invest 1 trillion yen ($11
billion) this financial year, focusing on yen-denominated bonds
for stable returns.  
 Nippon Life will also boost holdings in overseas bonds
without currency hedges in the 12 months through March 2011,
after increasing hedged-bond holdings last year, according to
its annual plan.  
 The insurer, with 47 trillion yen in assets, joins smaller
rivals Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co., Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance
Co. and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co., in betting on the safety of
fixed-income investments, amid signs governments in the coming
year may withdraw stimulus measures that have helped lift
Japanese exports and the nation’s economy.  
 “The bulk of our planned new investments this financial
year will still be in fixed-income securities, mostly in yen-
denominated bonds that provide stable income,” Yosuke Matsunaga,
general manager of the Tokyo-based insurer’s finance and
investment planning department, said at a briefing.  
 Holders of Japanese government bonds, or JGBs as they are
known, earned 1.4 percent on their investments last fiscal year,
as measured by indexes compiled by Bank of America Corp.’s
Merrill Lynch & Co. unit. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
jumped 37 percent in the same period.  
 Nippon Life’s unrealized gains on investments for the
fiscal year ended March 31 stood at 2.39 trillion yen, compared
with 1.05 trillion yen in the previous 12 months, according to
the plan.  
 Asset Classes  
 Among other asset classes, Nippon Life plans to maintain or
boost holdings in domestic and overseas equities this year, said
Matsunaga, adding that the likelihood of an increase is higher
for foreign equities. Holdings in loans and overseas bonds with
currency hedges will remain unchanged, while real estate
investments may increase slightly, he said.  
 In the fiscal year ended March 31, Nippon Life boosted
investments in overseas bonds with currency hedges by 1.35
trillion yen, taking advantage of low hedging costs, Matsunaga
said. It also increased holdings of yen-denominated bonds by 300
billion yen, while holdings of domestic and overseas stocks
increased by 150 billion yen and 100 billion yen, respectively.
