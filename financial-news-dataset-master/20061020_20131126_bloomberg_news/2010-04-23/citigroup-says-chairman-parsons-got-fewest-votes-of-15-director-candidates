             Citigroup Inc. Chairman Richard
Parsons, who presided over the bank’s four-hour annual meeting
this week, got the fewest votes of any of the 15 director
candidates, according to a company filing today.  
 Parsons, 62, got 93 percent of the votes cast, according to
the filing today by New York-based Citigroup. Proxy adviser
Glass, Lewis & Co. had recommended votes against him and other
directors who served in the years leading up to the bank’s $45
billion taxpayer bailout in 2008.  
 Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit was re-elected as a
director with 99 percent approval, according to the tally. The
other directors targeted by Glass, Lewis -- former Alcoa Inc.
Chairman Alain Belda, Dow Chemical Co. CEO Andrew Liveris and
Rockefeller Foundation President Judith Rodin -- got the next-
lowest number of votes among the remaining 14 candidates.  
 Separately, the company disclosed that eight executives
received about $17 million of stock, as part of a $1.7 billion
employee stock-grant program approved by shareholders at the
meeting. The program, approved by regulators and announced in
December, was designed to conserve cash by paying employees
their annual bonuses in stock instead of cash.  
 About 5,500 employees got the awards, and they can be sold
immediately, according to the filing.  
 Vice Chairman Lewis Kaden got $2.91 million of stock, based
on the $4.93 average price on April 21, according to a separate
filing.  
 Michael Corbat, CEO of the Citi Holdings division, got
$2.79 million. Chief Administrative Officer Don Callahan and
Chief Risk Officer Brian Leach each got $2.57 million. Asia-
Pacific Co-CEO Stephen Bird got $2.64 million, and his fellow
Co-CEO Shirish Apte got $1.7 million.  
 General Counsel Michael Helfer got $1.25 million, and
controller Jeffrey Walsh got $640,000.
