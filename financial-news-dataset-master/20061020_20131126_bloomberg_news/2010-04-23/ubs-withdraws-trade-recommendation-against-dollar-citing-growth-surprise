             UBS AG recommended that investors
close short bets that the dollar will fall against the euro,
pound, Australian dollar and yen.  
 The eight-week moving average of the U.S. growth surprise
index rose above the 1.5 standard deviation band, wrote Geoffrey
Kendrick, a foreign-exchange strategist at UBS in London, in a
research note today.  
 “The dollar recommendation is closed,” Kendrick wrote. A
short is a bet a currency will decrease.  
 The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the euro, yen, pound, Canadian
dollar, Swiss franc and Swedish krona, was headed for its first
weekly increase this month, rising 0.7 percent to 81.366. It
touched 82.074, the highest level since March 25.  
 U.S. new-home sales increased 27 percent in March, the most
since April 1963, the Commerce Department reported today. The
median forecast of 77 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a 5.5 percent gain. Bookings for U.S. durable goods
excluding transportation items increased 2.8 percent last month,
exceeding the median forecast of a 0.7 percent advance.  
 Investors who followed UBS’s recommendation on April 7
would have lost 0.4 percent, according to the bank.  
 The dollar advanced 0.8 percent against the yen and
appreciated 0.2 percent versus the Australian dollar since UBS
suggested shorting the greenback. The U.S. currency has dropped
0.9 percent versus the pound and decreased 0.3 percent versus
the euro during that period.  
 UBS reiterated its recommendation that investors buy
government, corporate and inflation-linked bonds.
