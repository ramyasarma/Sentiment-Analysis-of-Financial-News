             England rugby center Riki Flutey
signed a three-year contract to return to his former club,
London Wasps.  
 Flutey, 30, left Wasps after last season for French club
Brive. He was released by Brive after injuring his shoulder last
month and will undergo surgery in order to be ready for Wasps’
2010-11 season.  
 “I am delighted to be returning home to the U.K. and to
London Wasps,” the New Zealand-born Flutey said in a statement.
“I am now fully focused on getting my injury niggles behind me
and getting back to my best level as a player.”  
 Flutey was part of Wasps’ 2008 Premiership championship
squad. He’s made 13 appearances with the England national team
and was a member of the British and Irish Lions squad that
toured South Africa in 2009.
