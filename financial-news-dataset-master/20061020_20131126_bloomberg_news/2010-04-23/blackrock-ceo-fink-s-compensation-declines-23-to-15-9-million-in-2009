             BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive
Officer Laurence D. Fink received compensation valued at $15.9
million in 2009, 23 percent less than the prior year, according
to a regulatory filing.  
 Fink’s pay included a $500,000 base salary, a bonus of
$9.05 million, $5.99 million in stock awards and $321,079 in
other compensation, the New York-based firm said today in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In
2008, Fink’s pay package was valued at $20.6 million. His 2009
compensation calculated under guidelines that differ from SEC
disclosure rules was $26 million, BlackRock said.  
 BlackRock, which on Dec. 1 acquired the investment unit of
Barclays Plc to become the world’s biggest money manager, said
it adopted a new equity award plan that would enable key
executives, including the CEO, to get a bigger percentage of
their compensation in stock. The awards that were made last year
will vest on Jan. 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the filing shows.  
 Assets at BlackRock more than doubled to $3.35 trillion as
of Dec. 31 after its acquisition of Barclays Global Investors.
Excluding assets from the transaction, BlackRock’s assets rose
15 percent to $1.5 trillion, while shares surged 77 percent last
year.  
 Fink made more than counterparts at smaller rivals such as
T. Rowe Price Group Inc., whose CEO James Kennedy was paid $4.7
million in 2009, and Franklin Resources Inc.’s Gregory Johnson,
whose compensation in the 12 months ended Sept. 30 was $6.3
million.
