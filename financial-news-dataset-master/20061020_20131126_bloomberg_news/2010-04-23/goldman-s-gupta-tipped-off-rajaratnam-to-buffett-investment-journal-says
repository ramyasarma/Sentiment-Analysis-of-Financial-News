             A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. director
tipped off a hedge fund billionaire about a $5 billion
investment in the bank by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. before it became public knowledge, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.  
 The investment came at the height of the 2008 financial
crisis and Federal prosecutors say Goldman director Rajat Gupta
told Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam about the Berkshire
investment; investigators wrote to Gupta, who said last month
he was stepping down as a Goldman director, to say they had
found out about the tip through an intercepted phone call
between Gupta and Rajaratnam, the newspaper said.  
 Gupta hasn’t been formally accused of any wrongdoing and
Goldman wouldn’t coment, the Journal said, adding that his
lawyer said he hadn’t violated any law.  
 Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Connie Ling wouldn’t comment on
the report when contacted by Bloomberg News.  
 Rajaratnam is being sued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission for criminal insider-trading, which he denies.
