             Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s
most valuable company, rose for the second day in Mumbai trading
on expectations the explorer and refiner will report higher
earnings in the fourth quarter.  
 The shares gained 1.6 percent to 1,092.60 rupees at 9:23
a.m. in Mumbai trading compared with a 0.5 percent increase in
the benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange. The
shares rose 2.1 percent yesterday.  
 The Mumbai-based company controlled by Mukesh Ambani,
Asia’s richest man, may report net income of 51.4 billion rupees
in the three months ended March 31, according to the mean profit
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. That
compares with profit of 35.5 billion rupees a year earlier.
Reliance is scheduled to declare fourth-quarter earnings today.  
 “Everyone in the market expects Reliance to boost profits
because of higher gas output,” said Apurva Shah, the Mumbai-
based head of research at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. “Refining
profits are also recovering. The company is recovering.”  
 Reliance increased output from India’s biggest gas field,
which started operating in April last year, as accelerating
economic growth spurred demand from power and fertilizer
producers. The KG-D6 field currently produces about 64 million
cubic meters of gas a day.  
 Peak output at the field may rise to 80 million cubic
meters a day by the middle of 2010, the government said in
December.
