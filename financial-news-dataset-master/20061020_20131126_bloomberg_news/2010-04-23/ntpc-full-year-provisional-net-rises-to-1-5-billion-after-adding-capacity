             NTPC Ltd., India’s biggest power
producer, said full-year profit rose a provisional 5.6 percent,
the slowest pace in four years, after missing its target of
adding generation capacity. The shares declined.  
 Net income in the 12 months ended March 31 rose to 86.6
billion rupees ($1.9 billion) from 82 billion rupees a year
earlier, according to a statement of preliminary earnings issued
in New Delhi today. That compares with the 89.6 billion rupee
mean estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Provisional
sales were 465 billion rupees compared with 417.9 billion rupees.  
 NTPC plans to almost double generation capacity by 2012 to
meet energy demand and reduce blackouts in the world’s second-
fastest growing major economy. The government estimates the
economy may expand 8.25 percent to 8.75 percent in the 12 months
through March.  
 NTPC shares have risen 7 percent in the past year, trailing
the 59 percent increase in the benchmark Sensitive Index. The
stock fell 0.9 percent to 204.80 rupees at the close in Mumbai
trading, the lowest level since March 30.  
 “Profit growth was slower because last year we had an
income-tax refund,” R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director,
said in New Delhi today, without giving more information.  
 The state-owned utility based in New Delhi plans to more
than double spending to 223.5 billion rupees this year, adding
4,150 megawatts of capacity. That compares with 101.4 billion
rupees spent a year earlier, when 1,560 megawatts were added,
according to the statement.  
 Target Capacity  
 NTPC will miss its target of adding 3,300 megawatts of
generation capacity in 2009-10 because of equipment delays,
Sharma said in January.  
 The company is considering a plan to raise $500 million by
selling debt overseas and will be “comfortable” with paying a
5.5 to 6 percent interest rate on the debt, A.K. Singhal,
director of finance, said in New Delhi today. It tied up 168.2
billion rupees of loans in the year that ended March 31,
according to the statement.  
 NTPC plans to import 14 million metric tons of coal in the
year that began April 1, Sharma said. The New Delhi-based
company will burn 145 million to 150 million tons of coal in the
year, he said.
