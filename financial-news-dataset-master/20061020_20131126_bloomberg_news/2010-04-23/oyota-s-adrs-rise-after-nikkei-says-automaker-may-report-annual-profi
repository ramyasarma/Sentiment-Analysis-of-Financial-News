             Toyota Motor Corp. rose in New York
trading for the first time since April 14 after Nikkei English
News reported that the automaker may post an annual group
operating profit.  
 Earnings on that basis for the fiscal year ended March 31
may be as much as 50 billion yen ($531 million), the news
service said, without saying where it got the information.
Toyota had forecast a 20 billion yen loss, Nikkei said.  
 Toyota’s American depositary receipts gained 44 cents to
$77.64 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
Trading. The ADRs have declined 7.7 percent this year.
