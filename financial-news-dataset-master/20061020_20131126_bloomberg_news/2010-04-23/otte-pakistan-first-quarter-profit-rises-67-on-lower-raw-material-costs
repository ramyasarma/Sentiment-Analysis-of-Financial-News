             Lotte Pakistan PTA Ltd., which
produces pure terephthalic acid, the raw material used to make
polyester fiber, reported a 67 percent increase in first-quarter
profit because of lower raw material prices and higher sales.  
 The company’s profit rose to 873.1 million rupees ($10.4
million), or 0.58 rupee a share, in the quarter ended March 31,
from 523.5 million rupees, or 0.35 rupee, a year earlier, the
Karachi-based company said today in a statement to the stock
exchange. Sales increased to 9.74 billion rupees from 7.12
billion a year ago.  
 The lower price of paraxylene, a raw material used to
produce pure terephthalic acid, led to an increase in profit,
said Sana Iqbal Bawani, research analyst at BMA Capital
Management Ltd., in Karachi.  
 Pakistan’s textile makers use a combination of cotton and
polyester staple fiber to produce fabric to be sold overseas.
Textiles account for over 60 percent of the South Asian nation’s
overseas shipments.  
 The company’s shares fell 1 percent to 11.70 rupees at the
9:37 a.m. local time close on the Karachi Stock Exchange. The
share rose 45 percent this year.
