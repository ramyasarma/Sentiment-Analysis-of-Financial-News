             Japan’s creditworthiness is under
pressure as the government’s debt burden swells and households
save less, Fitch Ratings analyst Andrew Colquhoun said.  
 “On any measure, Japan is the most indebted sovereign
rated by Fitch,” Colquhoun, Hong Kong-based director at the
company’s Asia-Pacific sovereign group, said in a conference
call today.  
 “In the medium term, the Japanese sovereign’s ability to
go on funding itself cheaply may come under pressure from the
declining savings rate, although in the near term, weak credit
demand in the economy supports government funding prospects,”
Colquhoun said.  
 He spoke a day after Fitch released a report saying
Japan’s debt burden will keep rising in the absence of a
sustained economic recovery and fiscal consolidation. Colquhoun
said today that the outlook on Japan’s AA- credit rating, the
fourth highest, remains stable.  
 The yield on Japan’s 10-year bond was unchanged at 1.315
percent as of 1:22 p.m. in Tokyo.  
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan said yesterday after Fitch
released the report that the government’s plans to unveil a
fiscal strategy by June should help allay concerns about the
country’s debt.  
 Achievement of a budget surplus by 2020 is one of the
goals being considered as part of the plan, a government
official familiar with the matter said this week.  
 When asked about the discussions, Colquhoun said he will
need to see more details before he views such goals as a
“credible plan.”
