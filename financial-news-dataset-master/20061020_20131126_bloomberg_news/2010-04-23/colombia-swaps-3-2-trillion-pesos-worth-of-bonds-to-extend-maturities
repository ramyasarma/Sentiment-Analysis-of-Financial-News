             Colombia swapped 3.2 trillion pesos
($1.64 billion) of bonds due between 2010 and 2015 to extend
maturities as the government faces its biggest budget deficit in
five years.  
 Investors holding the securities exchanged them for bonds
in inflation-linked units known as UVR. The government offered
1.6 trillion pesos of UVR debt due in March 2013 to yield 3.54
percent, 1.07 trillion pesos of the new May 2017 UVR security to
yield 4.39 percent and 394 billion pesos of the February 2023
UVR bond to yield 4.61 percent, the Finance Ministry said in a
statement.  
 “The significant drop we’ve had in inflation forced the
government to offer high yields in order for investors to
participate in the swap,” said Andres Pardo, head analyst at
Corporacion Financiera Colombiana SA. “The amount exchanged is
very good.”  
 The yields offered by the ministry at the debt swap compare
to the February 2023 bonds trading today in the secondary market
at 4.48 percent, and the May 2013 bond at 3.45 percent,
according to the stock exchange.  
 The amount exchanged was more than the up to 2.5 trillion
pesos forecast by brokerage Correval SA, and the as much as 2
trillion pesos expected by Corredores Asociados SA.  
 Budget Deficit  
 Colombia forecasts the central government’s budget deficit
will widen to 4.5 percent of gross domestic product this year,
from 4.2 percent in 2009, as a sluggish economy crimps tax
revenue. In a report earlier this month, the Finance Ministry
said last year’s deficit was wider than the 4.1 percent
initially expected.  
 The government expects the economy to expand 2.5 percent in
2010, after last year undergoing its first recession in a
decade. The economy posted 0.4 percent growth in 2009.  
 Colombia repurchased fixed-rate bonds due November 2010,
August 2012, November 2013, May 2014 and October 2015, and UVR
bonds due September 2010 and January 2012.  
 The bond swap also eases pressure on the government’s
financing needs this year after it bought back 441 billion pesos
of the UVR bonds due in September, and 632 billion pesos of its
fixed-rate debt due in November, according to Pardo.  
 The yield on the country’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due
July 2020 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
8.28 percent at 4:20 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s
stock exchange. The bond’s price jumped 0.480 centavo to 118.271
centavos per peso.  
 Yields have dropped 50 basis points since an April 5
government report showed annual inflation slowed to 1.84 percent
in March, its lowest level since 1955, and below the 2.19
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Colombia’s peso strengthened 0.1 percent to 1,951.05 per
U.S. dollar, from 1,953.84 yesterday. It dropped 0.2 percent
this week and 1.6 percent so far this month.
