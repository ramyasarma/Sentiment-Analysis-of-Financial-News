             Legislation approved by a U.S.
Senate panel to regulate the $605 trillion over-the-counter
derivatives market calls for an examination of current and
proposed carbon markets.  
 The legislation, which passed the Senate Agriculture
Committee April 21 and may be combined with a broader measure
that overhauls financial industry regulations, would establish a
“working group” of U.S. agencies to study “the oversight of
existing and prospective carbon markets.”  
 The group would be made up of eight agencies, including the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. It
would report to Congress within six months on how to “ensure an
efficient, secure, and transparent carbon market,” according to
the derivatives bill.  
 Carbon markets are set up by cap-and-trade programs, which
allow companies to buy and sell a declining number of carbon
dioxide permits, or allowances. Carbon cap-and-trade programs
now operate in Europe and the U.S. Northeast.  
 Legislation to establish a national carbon cap-and-trade
program narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives last
year and stalled in the Senate. Three U.S. senators led by
Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry are revamping the cap-and-
trade legislation to try to get it through Congress this year.
Kerry, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham and Connecticut
independent Joseph Lieberman have said they will unveil their
new proposal on April 26.
