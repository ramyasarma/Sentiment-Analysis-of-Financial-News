             Zarein Ahmedzay, accused of
conspiring with admitted terrorist Najibullah Zazi in an
al-Qaeda plot to detonate bombs on New York subways, will plead
guilty today in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, court
records show.  
 U.S. prosecutors accused Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin, both
25, of helping plan an attack on Sept. 14, Sept. 15 or Sept. 16.
Ahmedzay will enter a guilty plea later today in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn, New York, records show.  
 Ahmedzay was charged in February with working with Zazi
from September 2008 to last September. Zazi admitted on Feb. 22
that he provided material support to al-Qaeda and planned to use
a weapon of mass destruction on the subway system.  
 Ahmedzay’s name appeared on a revised court schedule
released today, schedule for a “criminal cause for pleading”
before U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven Gold in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn. Ahmedzay’s lawyer, Michael Marinaccio, didn’t
immediately respond to a voice-mail message left at his office
