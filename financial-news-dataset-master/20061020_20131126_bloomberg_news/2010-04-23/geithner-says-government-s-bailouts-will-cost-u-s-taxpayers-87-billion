             U.S. government bailouts, including
funds for Citigroup Inc. and American International Group Inc.,
will cost taxpayers about $87 billion, according to a letter
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner sent congressional
leaders.  
 The Troubled Asset Relief Program will lose about $117
billion, and funding related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will
cost taxpayers another $85 billion, Geithner said in a letter
today to the Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate and
House. The government expects to make about $115 billion on
Federal Reserve programs, including the purchase of mortgage-
backed securities, he wrote.  
 Obama administration and regulator policies “have
stabilized our financial system,” Geithner said. “The banking
system is now better-capitalized than before the crisis.” A
year ago the Treasury estimated that bailout costs could reach
$500 billion, he said.  
 Congress authorized $700 billion for TARP in October 2008
to prevent a collapse of the U.S. financial system. The program
has been criticized by lawmakers from both parties, including
Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, and
Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, for helping
big banks more than average citizens.  
 Quick End  
 Treasury is ending TARP and other bailout programs “as
quickly as possible,” Geithner said in the letter. The bailout
costs will be less than 1 percent of gross domestic product,
down from an estimate of 3.5 percent a year ago, he said.  
 “However, the financial and economic recovery is
incomplete,” Geithner said.  
 Herbert Allison, the Treasury’s assistant secretary for
financial stability, told Congress yesterday that TARP’s wind-
down will vary by company.  
 “Some institutions are thriving and have the ability to
repay Treasury now or in the very near future,” Allison told a
House Appropriations subcommittee. “Other institutions will
need more time to recover and repay Treasury, which is to be
expected given the nature and impact of this financial crisis.”  
 General Motors Co. repaid $4.7 billion in loans to the
Treasury on April 21. The company is still 61 percent owned by
taxpayers as part of the financing for the automaker’s 2009
bankruptcy.
