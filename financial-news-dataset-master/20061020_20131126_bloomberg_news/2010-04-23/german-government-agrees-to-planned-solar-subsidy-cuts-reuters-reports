             The German government agreed on
plans to slash subsidies for solar energy, sticking to the main
points the Cabinet had agreed on earlier, Reuters reported
today, citing unidentified officials.  
 Rates for rooftop systems will be cut by 16 percent as
planned, according to the report. Most solar parks will get 15
percent less money while converted farmlend won’t be subsidized
anymore from July 1, Reuters said.
