             Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of
Trane air conditioners, fell the most in two months after first-
quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates amid declining demand
from non-residential construction in the U.S. and Europe.  
 Ingersoll dropped $2.52, or 6.5 percent, to $36.48 at 2:02
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
earlier decreased as much as 8.5 percent, the largest intraday
decline since Feb. 12.  
 “The Trane commercial business continues to see equipment
and systems revenue decline significantly,” Daniel Dowd, a New
York-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said today in
a note to investors. “With continued pressure on commercial
construction in 2010, and the possibility for weakness to extend
into 2011, we believe this end market will continue to be a
drag.”  
 First-quarter profit excluding some items was 16 cents a
share, Swords, Ireland-based Ingersoll said today in a
statement. The company was projected to report per-share
earnings of 20 cents, the average estimate of 17 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Revenue of $2.95 billion fell 1.6 percent short of the low
end of the company’s February forecast. Ingersoll “has
confidence” the revenue shortfall “was timing related,” Chief
Executive Officer Michael Lamach, who became CEO in February,
said today on a conference call.  
 Ingersoll today forecast full-year profit of $1.88 to $2.23
a share. That compares with the $2.22 average estimate from 18
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
