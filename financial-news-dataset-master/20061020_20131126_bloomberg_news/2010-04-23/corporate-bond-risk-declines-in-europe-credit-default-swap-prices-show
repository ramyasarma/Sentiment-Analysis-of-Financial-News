             The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 5.5
basis points to 424, according to Markit Group Ltd. prices
at 7:17 a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the
cost of protecting bonds against default and a decline
signals an improvement in the perception of credit quality.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1 basis point to 86.25,
Markit Group prices show.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a company fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.
