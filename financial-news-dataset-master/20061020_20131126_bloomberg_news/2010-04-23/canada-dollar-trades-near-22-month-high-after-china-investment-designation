             The Canadian dollar traded near a
22-month high, erasing earlier losses, after Finance Minister
Jim Flaherty said China designated Canada as a country where its
financial institutions can make investments.  
 Canada’s currency earlier declined, falling as much as 0.6
percent, after inflation failed to keep pace with economists’
forecasts. Flaherty said the China designation may lead to up to
$8 billion of capital flowing into Canada. Standard & Poor’s
Rating Services affirmed its AAA long-term and A-1+ short-term
sovereign ratings on Canada with a stable outlook.  
 The announcement was “just more good news for Canadian-
dollar bulls -- especially considering the $8 billion mentioned
by the finance department,” said Steve Butler, director of
foreign-exchange trading in Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia,
Canada’s third-largest lender.  
 The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, appreciated 0.1 percent to
99.91 cents per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0004
yesterday. It posted a weekly gain of 1.4 percent after reaching
99.31 cents per greenback on April 21, the strongest level since
June 2008. Canada’s government bonds advanced today.  
 Citigroup Inc. advised “shorting” the U.S. dollar versus
its Canadian counterpart. A short position is a bet that a
currency will decline. The New York-based bank said in a
research note it’s going short at C$1.0018 to the U.S. dollar,
targeting the 2007 low around 90.50 Canadian cents. It set a
stop loss at C$1.0225.  
 Crude Climbs  
 Crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, climbed after sales of
new U.S. homes surged in March by 27 percent, the most since
1963, bolstering optimism American economic growth will
accelerate. Crude for June delivery increased 1.7 percent to
$85.09 a barrel in New York. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
gained 0.7 percent.  
 The annual inflation rate unexpectedly slowed to 1.4
percent in March from 1.6 percent in the previous month as
clothing and mortgage interest expenses fell while gasoline
costs rose, Statistics Canada data showed today.  
 February retail sales increased a less-than-forecast 0.5
percent to C$36 billion ($35.9 billion), the third straight
monthly advance, led by new automobile purchases, a separate
Statistics Canada report showed. Total receipts were forecast to
grow 1 percent, according to the median response of 21
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The Bank of Canada signaled on April 20 it may be the first
among the Group of Seven nations to increase borrowing costs as
economic growth accelerates and stokes inflation.  
 Phrase Dropped  
 In its decision to leave the target overnight lending rate
at a record low 0.25 percent, policy makers dropped a phrase
about a “conditional commitment” to keep the benchmark
unchanged until July unless the inflation outlook shifted.  
 The central bank’s next two rate decisions are scheduled
for June 1 and July 20.  
 This year will mark the “turning point” for the nation’s
economic rebound from one driven by stimulus measures to a
slower expansion led by business investment and trade, the Bank
of Canada said yesterday in its monetary policy report.  
 It also said the strength of the Canadian currency could be
a “drag on growth.” The loonie has gained 22 percent against
its U.S. counterpart in the past 12 months in the fourth-best
performance among the 16 most-traded currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  
 Rate Bets  
 The yield on June 2010 bankers’ acceptances futures
contracts fell two basis points to 0.95 percent, suggesting
investors are paring bets for a central bank rate increase that
month. The yield on September 2010 and December 2010 contracts
also fell, dropping three basis points to 1.46 percent and four
points to 1.94 percent, respectively. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 “This takes some pressure off of the Bank of Canada to
hike at the June 1 meeting,” said David Love, a trader of
interest-rate derivatives in Montreal at brokerage Le Groupe
Jitney Inc. “Bax contracts have rallied somewhat, but there are
a bunch of speculative longs in here which is damping the move
higher.” A long position is a wager a security will increase.  
 The Canadian government two-year note’s yield fell four
basis points to 1.98 percent. The price of the 1.5 percent
security maturing in March 2012 rose 7 cents to C$99.14.
