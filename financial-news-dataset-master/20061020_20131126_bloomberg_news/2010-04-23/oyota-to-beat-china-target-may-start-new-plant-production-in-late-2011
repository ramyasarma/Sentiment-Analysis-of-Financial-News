             Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s
biggest carmaker, may beat a sales target in China and plans to
begin production at a new plant as early as 2011, an executive
said today.  
 Toyota’s sales in the nation may exceed an 800,000-unit
2010 target, Masahiro Kato, president of the company’s China
business told reporters at the Beijing Auto Show. The new plant,
located in Changchun, Jilin province, will start production in
late 2011 or early 2012 and have a yearly production capacity of
100,000 vehicles, he said.  
 The automaker is adding capacity in China, the world’s
largest car market, after sales growth lagged behind rivals last
year. Underscoring the importance of the market, President Akio
Toyoda didn’t attend Europe’s Geneva auto show in March and flew 
to China to apologize customers after Toyota recalled 75,552
locally made RAV4 sport-utility vehicles.  
 “China has become a big market for Toyota and for all
automakers,” said Koji Endo, managing director of Tokyo-based
Advanced Research Japan. “It’s important for Toyota to have
more capacity in a market that will grow.”  
 The Changchun plant will be operated with joint-venture
partner China FAW Group Corp.  
 Toyota shares fell 0.8 percent to 3,570 yen in Tokyo
trading.  
 Exceeding Sales  
 The Toyota City-based carmaker had said it expects sales to
rise 13 percent this year to reach 800,000 units.  
 The company, which is struggling to recover its reputation
after recalling over 8 million vehicles worldwide for problems
related to unintended acceleration, also plans to increase
capacity at a joint-venture plant with FAW in Chengdu to 30,000
units from 13,000 units by June, according to Toyota spokeswoman
Ririko Takeuchi. The plant builds the Coaster and Land Cruiser
Prado models.  
 Toyota currently has total production capacity of about
803,000 units in China.  
 Toyota’s China sales rose 21 percent to 709,000 units in
2009. By comparison, General Motors Co., China’s biggest foreign
automaker, boosted 2009 sales 67 percent to 1.83 million and
expects to sell about 2 million vehicles this year.
