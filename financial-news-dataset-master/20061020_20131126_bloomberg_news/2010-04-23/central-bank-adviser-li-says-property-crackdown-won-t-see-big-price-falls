             China’s measures to rein in
property bubbles in some cities will not trigger steep falls in
house prices, said central bank adviser Li Daokui.  
 Property prices won’t drop more than 10 percent and won’t
lead to large-scale declines of 20 to 30 percent, Li said in a
telephone interview today.  
 Li’s view puts him at odds with BNP Paribas SA, which
forecasts that home prices may fall as much as 20 percent in the
second half of this year as measures to contain credit cool
speculation. China’s measures to curb spiraling property prices
will “strike a deadly blow” against speculators, a government
researcher wrote in the China Daily yesterday.  
 “The government only wants to curtail excessive price
gains in some areas,” said Li. “Cities such as Beijing,
Shanghai and Shenzhen may experience some correction but price
declines won’t be more than 10 percent.”
