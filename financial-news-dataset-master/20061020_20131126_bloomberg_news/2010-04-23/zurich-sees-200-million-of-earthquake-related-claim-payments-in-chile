             Zurich Financial Services AG,
Switzerland’s largest insurer, said it expects claims of about
$200 million in the first quarter related to the earthquake that
struck Chile in February.  
 The pretax figure is net of “reinsurance recoverables”
and includes reinsurance reinstatement premiums, the company
said in an e-mailed statement. Zurich will report first-quarter
results on May 6.  
 The claims were higher than expected, Fabrizio Croce, a
Zurich-based analyst with Kepler Capital Markets, said in a note
to investors. “The claims are considerable, considering what we
have seen so far for reinsurers.”  
 Munich Re and Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world’s largest
reinsurers, have estimated losses for the insurance industry
from the 8.8-magnitude quake, the world’s fifth strongest in a
century, could run to $7 billion. They put their own exposure at
about $546 million and $500 million, respectively.  
 Stockbroker Collins Stewart said today that Zurich may
report a total of $420 million in claims from natural
catastrophes and storms in the first quarter. The company “is
likely to have picked up material losses from the severe winter
in the northeast U.S., Ireland, the U.K. and part of continental
Europe, on top of Xynthia storm damage in Germany and hail and
typhoon damage in Australia,” London-based analyst Ben Cohen
wrote in a note.  
 The Swiss insurer dropped 0.2 percent to 248.70 Swiss
francs in Zurich, valuing the company at about 36.7 billion
francs ($34.1 billion).
