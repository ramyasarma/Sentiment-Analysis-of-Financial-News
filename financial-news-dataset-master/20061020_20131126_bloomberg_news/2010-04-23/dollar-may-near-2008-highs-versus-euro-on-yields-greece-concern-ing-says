             The dollar may climb to the highest
since October 2008 this year as U.S. yields lure investors
concerned about European contagion from Greece’s fiscal woes,
ING Investment Management said.  
 Yields on two-year Treasuries climbed in April to the
highest this year on prospects for a recovery in the world’s
largest economy after a report showed the fastest employment
gain in three years. The International Monetary Fund this week
raised its forecast for U.S. growth while keeping its target for
the euro area unchanged, saying countries risked “severe”
consequences from a failure to contain soaring public debt.  
 “We’re not looking for the euro to collapse, but a move
back to $1.23-$1.24 looks feasible as a first step,” said Mark
Robertson, a senior portfolio manager at ING Investment, where
he helps oversee about A$20 billion ($18 billion) as part of a
multi-strategies group. “The catalyst for that will be a
sustained rise in U.S. yields, particularly at the front-end.”  
 The dollar has risen 8 percent against Europe’s common
currency this year and traded at $1.3266 per euro as of 9:07 a.m.
in London. It has gained 0.4 percent since Dec. 31 to 93.36 yen.  
 The dollar rose to as high as $1.2330 in October 2008, the
strongest since April 2006.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold Greek 10-year
bonds climbed to almost three times the comparable German rate
yesterday as the European Union said Greece’s budget deficit
last year was worse than estimated and Moody’s Investors Service
cut the country’s credit ranking.  
 Bond Redemptions  
 Greece faces bond redemptions of 17 billion euros ($22.6
billion) this year, with 8.1 billion euros due May 19. The
government needs a further 31 billion euros to cover debt
maturing in 2011.  
 “It’s not just the next three months, but the next 12 to
18 months because Greece has a fairly lumpy maturity profile
over this year and the next,” said Robertson.  
 Budget shortfalls across the euro region have surged as
governments bailed out banks and spent billions on economic
stimulus. Portugal had a deficit of 9.4 percent of gross
domestic product in 2009 and the government has pledged to
narrow the gap to 8.3 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2013.  
 Fitch Ratings on March 24 lowered Portugal’s credit rating,
adding that further economic or fiscal underperformance may lead
to another downgrade.  
 “The market is concerned about potential contagion,” said
Robertson. “There’s enough out there that the market is
assessing the long-term outlook for the euro and asking, is it
going to maintain its current state?”  
 U.S. Yields  
 Gross domestic product in the U.S. will expand 3.1 percent
this year, the IMF said, up from a January forecast for 2.7
percent growth in the world’s largest economy. The euro area is
likely to expand 1 percent this year, unchanged from the January
projection, it said.  
 U.S. bond yields will probably begin rising in June on
market bets for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at
the end of the year or beginning of 2011, Robertson said.
Futures markets are pricing in a 50 percent chance that Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke will raise the target rate, now at a range of
zero to 0.25 percent, as early as November.  
 U.S. two-year yields of about 1.5 percent to 2 percent will
“bring the euro under pressure,” said Robertson.  
 The greenback will strengthen against the yen as the higher
growth rate and more attractive yields found in the U.S. draw
investment flows from Japanese investors, he said. The dollar
will likely climb toward 99 yen by the end of the year, said
Robertson.
