             Dover Corp., the parent of more
than 30 companies that make products from hearing-aid parts to
gasoline-pump nozzles, rose the most in 17 months after its
first-quarter profit and 2010 forecast beat analysts’ estimates.  
 Dover climbed $4.44, or 8.8 percent, to $54.69 at 10:37
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock
earlier reached $55.50 in the biggest intraday gain since Nov.
24, 2008, making it one of the top gainers in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  
 Profit from continuing operations was 65 cents a share, New
York-based Dover said in a statement today. The average estimate
of eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey was 51 cents a share.
Sales rose 15 percent to $1.6 billion, exceeding the estimate of
$1.5 billion.  
 “After a difficult 2009, I am encouraged by our solid
first-quarter performance,” Chief Executive Officer Robert
Livingston said in the statement. “We are seeing evidence of a
global economic recovery across a wide portion of our portfolio
and we expect these trends to benefit us next quarter and for
the year.”  
 Full-year earnings from continuing operations may be $2.70
to $2.95 a share, Dover said. The average analysts’ estimate was
$2.53 a share.  
 Net income for the quarter more than doubled to $108.1
million, or 58 cents a share, from $53.4 million, or 29 cents.  
 Volume increases in electronic technologies, fluid
management and product identification and the benefits of
restructuring resulted in segment margins of 15 percent, which
helped double the company’s earnings from the prior year,
Livingston said.
