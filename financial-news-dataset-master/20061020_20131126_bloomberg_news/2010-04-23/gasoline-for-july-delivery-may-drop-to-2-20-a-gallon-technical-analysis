             Gasoline for July delivery is
poised for a drop to $2.20 a gallon after the rally from early
February “has been giving signs of fatigue,” according to a
technical analysis by Newedge Group.  
 “The picture is heavy” for the contract, with a bearish
seasonal tendency in May also pointing to lower prices in coming
weeks, said Veronique Lashinski, a senior research analyst for
Newedge USA LLC in Chicago. A close below $2.265 would confirm a
so-called bearish flag pattern and point to a decline.  
 Gasoline prices failing to reach the upper boundary of a
rising trend channel earlier this month “is a sign of
weakness,” she said.  
 July futures have fallen during May for 11 of the last 15
years, according to Newedge.  
 A close above $2.325 would point to a continuation of the
current uptrend, Lashinski said. The July contract rose 1.17
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.3165 a gallon yesterday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
