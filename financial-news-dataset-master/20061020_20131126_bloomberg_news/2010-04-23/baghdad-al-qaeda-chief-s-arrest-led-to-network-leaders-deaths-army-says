             Iraq’s military said the arrest a
month ago of al-Qaeda’s Baghdad chief helped security forces
track down and kill two men described by the U.S. and Iraq as
the network’s two most senior leaders in the country.  
 Manaf Abdul Raheem al-Rawi, the so-called governor of
Baghdad, was arrested in the capital on March 11, Major General
Qassim Atta, spokesman for the Baghdad Military Command, said in
an address televised by state-owned al-Iraqiya yesterday.  
 Al-Rawi planned and oversaw attacks in Baghdad last year on
government buildings, hotels and universities, Atta said. His
arrest was kept quiet so that officials could gather a “huge”
amount of information on his organization, the spokesman said.  
 The arrest of al-Rawi enabled U.S. and Iraqi forces to kill
Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayoub al-Masri in a joint raid on
April 18, according to Atta. It also led to the death of Ahmad
al-Obaidi, the network’s northern military commander, in another
joint operation on April 20, he said.
