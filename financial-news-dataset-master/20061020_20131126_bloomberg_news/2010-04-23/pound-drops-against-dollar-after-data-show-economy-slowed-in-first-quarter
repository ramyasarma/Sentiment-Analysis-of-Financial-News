             The pound declined versus the
dollar and pared a gain against the euro after the Office for
National Statistics said the economy expanded 0.2 percent in the
first quarter, less than the 0.4 percent estimated in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 The pound slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5346 as of 9:33 a.m. in
London, and fell 0.1 percent to 86.55 pence per euro.
