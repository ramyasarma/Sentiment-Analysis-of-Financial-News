             The search for 11 missing crew
members from a Transocean Ltd. drilling rig that caught fire and
sank in the Gulf of Mexico has been suspended, the U.S. Coast
Guard said on its Web site.  
 Of 126 workers aboard the rig, which sank yesterday, 115
were rescued. If the missing workers died, it would be the
deadliest U.S. offshore rig explosion since 1968, when 11 died
and 20 were injured at a platform owned by Gulf Oil Corp.,
according to data from the Minerals Management Service. A 1987
helicopter crash aboard a Forest Oil Corp. platform killed 14
people.  
 The rig burned for more than 24 hours after the Tuesday-
night explosion that Geneva-based Transocean said may have been
caused by a blowout, an unexpected surge in pressure that
ejected petroleum at the top of the well.  
 The rig has leaked about 200 barrels of petroleum and
there’s no oil escaping from the well it had tapped, the U.S.
Coast Guard said today.
