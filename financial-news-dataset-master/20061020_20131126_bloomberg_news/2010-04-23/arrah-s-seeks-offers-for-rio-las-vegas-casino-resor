             Harrah’s Entertainment Inc., the
casino company owned by Apollo Management LP and TPG Inc., is
seeking bids for the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas,
people with knowledge of the situation said.  
 Starwood Capital Group LLC and Colony Capital LLC are among
the companies that are weighing bids for the resort, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. Some bids value the Rio at about $500 million, two of
the people said.  
 Harrah’s, the world’s biggest casino company, is exploring
a sale of the off-Strip property two months after buying Planet
Hollywood Resort & Casino. Las Vegas is coming out of a two-year
slump that took casino operators to the brink of bankruptcy.
Chief Executive Officer Gary Loveman cut Harrah’s debt by $4.2
billion in 2009 by offering creditors new bonds at a discount.
He extended maturities on another $5.5 billion this year.  
 Planet Hollywood gave Harrah’s a Strip property close to
most of its other Vegas resorts for less than it would cost to
build.  
 Rio is west of the Strip across Interstate 15, on about 89
acres behind Caesars Palace, which is Harrah’s biggest Las Vegas
property. Rio has a 117,300-square-foot casino, with 1,100 slot
machines, 90 gaming tables and 2,520 rooms, according to
regulatory filings.  
 Harrah’s also owns Paris, Bally’s, Flamingo, Harrah’s, the
Imperial Palace, and Bill’s Gamblin’ Hall & Saloon in Las Vegas.  
 Harrah’s spokeswoman Jacqueline Peterson declined to
comment, as did representatives of Starwood Capital and Colony.  
 Betting on Vegas  
 Leon Black’s Apollo Management and TPG Inc. took Harrah’s
private in January 2008 for $30.7 billion, including debt and
transaction costs.  
 Investors are shopping for Las Vegas casinos on a bet the
economic recovery will bring more visitors and bolster property
values. Billionaire Carl Icahn bought the bankrupt Fontainebleau
Las Vegas in February for $156 million. The casino resort, about
70 percent complete at a cost of $2 billion, occupies about 27
acres at the north end of the Las Vegas Strip.  
 Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital is trying to take over
Riviera Holdings Corp. four years after a bid he backed was shot
down by shareholders.  
 Starwood Capital is leading creditors negotiating a
prepackaged bankruptcy, Sternlicht said on a call with potential
investors in February. Riviera, which owns a Colorado casino, in
addition to the 55-year-old Las Vegas resort, defaulted on a
$245 million loan in February 2009.
