             Honeywell International Inc., the
maker of car turbochargers and gas detectors, said profit this
year will be higher than it previously predicted because of
rising demand from automakers.  
 Profit will be $2.30 to $2.45 a share, compared with a
previous estimate of $2.20 to $2.40, the Morris Township, New
Jersey-based company said today in a statement.  
 Chief Executive Officer David Cote said last month that
orders in the first three months strengthened in the turbo
technologies unit and some parts of the automation and controls
division. Honeywell trimmed more than 4,400 jobs last year to
adjust for reduced demand as sales dropped 15 percent.  
 “Honeywell’s first-quarter performance reflects better-
than-expected improvements in many of our end markets, coupled
with strong commercial execution and disciplined cost
controls,” Cote said in the statement.  
 First-quarter net income fell to $386 million, or 50 cents
a share, from $397 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier. The
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts was 47
cents a share. Sales climbed 2.7 percent to $7.78 billion.  
 Honeywell rose 75 cents to $47.44 yesterday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 21 percent
this year before today.
