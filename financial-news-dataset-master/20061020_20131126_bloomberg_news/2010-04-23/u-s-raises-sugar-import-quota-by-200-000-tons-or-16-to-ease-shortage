             The U.S. boosted its import quota
for raw sugar by 16 percent in an attempt to ease a supply
shortage that pushed retail prices to a record.  
 An additional 200,000 short tons (181,437 metric tons) will
be added to the tariff-rate quota for the year that ends Sept.
30, the Department of Agriculture said today in a statement on
its Web site. The original quota, set on Sept. 25, was at 1.23
million, the minimum amount the U.S. has committed to import
under a World Trade Organization agreement.  
 In March, retail prices reached an all-time high, according
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, contracts for raw sugar, used mainly by domestic refiners
and industrial consumers to hedge supply risks, are about 14
cents a pound above global prices. That’s close to the biggest
premium since at least September 2008, Bloomberg data show.  
 The quota increase is about a fifth of what sugar users and
producers have called for. Imperial Sugar Co. the second-largest
U.S. processor, said last month the USDA should boost the quota
by 1 million metric tons, a proposal backed by groups including
the National Confectioners Association and the National Foreign
Trade Council.  
 Sugar is the only major agricultural commodity produced in
the U.S. that is subject to import quotas. The limits were
established to benefit domestic growers. In 2008, Mexico became
exempt under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
