             Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
fell, capping its biggest weekly retreat in almost three months,
on concern swelling government debt will derail the global
economic recovery.  
 Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., which gets 21 percent of its
revenue in Europe, led shipping lines lower after China Cosco
Holdings Co., the world’s largest operator of dry-bulk ships,
posted an annual loss, and the euro region reported a wider
deficit. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., whose No. 1 overseas market
is North America, lost 1 percent after Baxter International Inc.
said costs from the U.S. health-care overhaul will hurt profit.
Honda Motor Co. rose 1.1 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said
the carmaker’s earnings gained.  
 The Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent to close at 10,914.46 in
Tokyo. The broader Topix index was little changed at 978.20,
with almost twice as many shares rising as declining. Fitch
Ratings said yesterday that Japan’s swelling debt may put
“downward pressure” on the nation’s sovereign AA-rating.  
 “Uncertainty surrounding sovereign-credit risk is too
high,” said Tomomi Yamashita, a Tokyo-based fund manager at
Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of
$3.8 billion. “The Nikkei above 11,000 almost fully prices in
this year’s earnings.”  
 The Nikkei 225 has slipped 1.7 percent in the past five
days, its biggest weekly retreat since the period ended Jan. 29,
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. for misstating and omitting facts about
collateralized-debt obligations. Stocks in the gauge trade at
21.6 times estimated earnings, the fourth-highest level globally,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Drugmakers Slump  
 Kawasaki Kisen, Japan’s No. 3 shipping line, slid 3.5
percent to 387 yen, reducing its three-day gain to 7.2 percent.
Market leader Nippon Yusen K.K. lost 1.8 percent to 377 yen.
Shipping lines collectively fell the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups.  
 China Cosco said yesterday it had a net loss in 2009 after
rates for hauling commodities and containers tumbled on
overcapacity and the global recession. Shares of China Cosco
lost as much as 2.5 percent in Hong Kong.  
 The European Union’s statistics office said yesterday the
total budget shortfall for the 16-nation euro region widened to
6.3 percent of gross domestic product last year, the most since
the introduction of the euro in 1999. Moody’s Investors Service
reduced its rating on debt-stricken Greece by one level to A3.  
 “Investors are jittery about huge budget shortfalls, which
are deterring governments from offering further stimulus,” said
Juichi Wako, a strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc.  
 Drugmakers Decline  
 Takeda, Asia’s biggest drugmaker, dropped 1 percent to
3,970 yen, while Daiichi Sankyo Co., which gets 25 percent of
its revenue in North America, dropped 2.2 percent to 1,631 yen.
Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. sank 1.5 percent to 1,767 yen after
saying at midday that first-quarter earnings dropped 43 percent.  
 Baxter, an Illinois-based maker of blood products and
vaccines, cut its 2010 profit forecast, expecting an increase in
Medicaid rebates and a change in the taxes for retiree
prescription drug benefits required under the U.S. health-care
law enacted in March.  
 Honda, Japan’s No. 2 automaker, increased 1.1 percent to
3,215 yen and was the biggest contributor to the Topix.
Operating profit probably jumped 90 percent to 360 billion yen
($3.85 billion) for the year ended March 31, helped by
“strong” demand in emerging markets, the Nikkei newspaper
reported, without saying how it got the information.  
 Mitsui Fudosan Co., the nation’s largest property developer,
advanced 1.4 percent to 1,634 yen. The company may report net
income for the year ended March 31 that is higher than its
forecast, the Nikkei said. Real-estate stocks were the second-
biggest contributors the Topix among its 33 groups.
