             Yuan forwards weakened after a
report said China’s currency regulator may curb banks’ overseas
borrowings to ease appreciation pressure.  
 The State Administration of Foreign Exchange may cut this
year’s quota of short-term foreign debt for some banks to reduce
speculation in the nation’s currency market, Reuters reported
today, citing people familiar with the situation. The yuan’s
spot rate declined as much as 0.05 percent to 6.83 per dollar
earlier today, the weakest since March 2.  
 “The NDF market is probably following the move in the
spot,” said Liu Dongliang, a Shenzhen-based analyst at China
Merchants Bank Co., the country’s fifth-largest lender by market
value. “Traders may be worried such a move would reduce
foreign-currency inflows and increase demand for the dollar.”  
 Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.1 percent
to 6.6110 per dollar as of 5:25 p.m. in Hong Kong, a level still
0.1 percent stronger than at the end of last week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts, which yesterday
reached a three-month high of 6.593, reflect bets the currency
will strengthen 3.3 percent.  
 Mounting expectations of yuan gains have deterred investors
from holding dollars, reducing the supply of the U.S. currency
at Chinese banks. The dollar’s one-month interbank rate in China
was 1.4 percent today, according to Shanghai CFETS-ICAP
International Money Broking Co., ICAP Plc’s joint venture in the
nation, compared with a 0.26 percent rate in London yesterday.  
 G-20 Talks  
 G-20 finance chiefs including U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner and European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet begin a day of talks at 9:30 a.m. in Washington,
with a statement and press conferences scheduled for about 5 p.m.
that may include comment on the yuan. It’s their first meeting
since September’s decision by leaders to make the G-20 the
premier forum for setting international economic policy.  
 After scrapping a peg to the dollar in July 2005, the
Chinese government allowed the yuan to gain 21 percent before
holding it at about 6.83 to the dollar since July 2008. While
that aids its exporters, it has incurred criticism abroad for
hurting foreign manufacturers and fanning Chinese inflation.  
 Government bonds gained this week. The yield on the 3.15
percent note due July 2016 fell nine basis points this week to
3.05 percent, and the price of the security gained 0.50 per 100
yuan face amount to 100.55, according to the National Interbank
Funding Center.
