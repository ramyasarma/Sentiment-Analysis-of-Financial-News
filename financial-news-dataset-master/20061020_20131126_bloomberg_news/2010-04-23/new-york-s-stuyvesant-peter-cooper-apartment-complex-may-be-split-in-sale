             Manhattan’s Stuyvesant Town and
Peter Cooper Village apartments, the city’s largest residential
enclave, could be sold as two properties under a foreclosure
proposal by lenders.  
 Bank of America Corp. and special loan servicer CWCapital
Asset Management LLC, acting on behalf of senior creditors,
asked for court approval to offer the 80-acre property in either
one or two pieces in a foreclosure auction, according to a
filing yesterday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.  
 Tishman Speyer Properties LP and BlackRock Inc. bought the
developments for $5.4 billion in 2006 near the top of the U.S.
real estate boom. The mortgage in default is secured by two
distinct parcels, a division that requires offering them for
sale separately, said Greg Cross, a Baltimore-based partner at
the Venable LLP law firm representing CWCapital.  
 “Tishman has consented to the foreclosure and the other
defendants have answered, so we thought it was appropriate to
file a motion,” Cross said.  
 The owners missed a payment on the $3 billion senior
mortgage in January after failing to raise rents as fast as
anticipated. The companies have been seeking to turn the complex
over to creditors ever since.  
 Debt from the senior mortgage, which was securitized and
sold to investors from New York to Singapore, has ballooned to
$3.66 billion, according to the filing, which asks a judge for
permission to begin foreclosure.  
 Appaloosa’s Position  
 The request could be delayed by Appaloosa Investment LP,
the hedge fund run by David Tepper, which is seeking to join the
lawsuit. Appaloosa opposes the foreclosure because it may lose
as much as $200 million if the case proceeds.  
 Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who is presiding over the case,
has yet to address Appaloosa’s request, said Kathy Patrick, a
lawyer for Appaloosa at Gibbs & Bruns LLP in Houston.  
 “Our motion was on file first,” Patrick said. “We’re
confident the judge is going to consider it appropriately.”  
 Proceeds from the foreclosure would go toward covering the
mortgage, late charges and expenses including legal costs.  
 Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village run from 14th
Street to 23rd Street on Manhattan’s east side. Some residents
welcome the march toward foreclosure because they’re piecing
together a plan to purchase their apartments, said City
Councilman Daniel Garodnick, a Peter Cooper Village resident.  
 Tenants oppose dividing the developments, he said.  
 “We have always said that this is one single, united
community and we hope that it will remain that way,” Garodnick
said.  
 The case is Bank of America N.A. v. PCV ST Owner LP, 10-
01178, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).
