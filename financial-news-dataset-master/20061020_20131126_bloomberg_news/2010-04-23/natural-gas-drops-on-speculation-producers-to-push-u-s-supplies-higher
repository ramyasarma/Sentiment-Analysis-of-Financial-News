             Natural gas futures rose in New
York after data showed the number of gas drilling rigs in the
U.S. fell for the first time this year, a sign that producers
are cutting exploration and production.  
 The number of gas drilling rigs fell 17 to 956 this week,
the first decline since Dec. 25, according to Baker Hughes Inc.
Gas also gained as sales of new U.S. homes surged last month by
the most in almost five decades, boosting optimism that demand
for the industrial fuel will increase.  
 “This might be a sign that producers are starting to cut
back,” said Phil Flynn, vice president of research at PFGBest
in Chicago. “The economy is getting better so demand should
improve a little bit, and the market is trying to react to
that.”  
 Natural gas for May delivery gained 12.9 cents, or 3.1
percent, to settle at $4.257 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures have fallen 24
percent this year.  
 The U.S. gas rig count fell to 665 on July 17, 2009, the
lowest level since May 2002. The number rose to 973 in the week
ended April 16, up 46 percent from July’s low.  
 The rig count could “retrace back toward the 900 level,”
said Cameron Horwitz, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Inc. in Houston.  
 Power Demand  
 Gas also rose on anticipation demand for electricity from
gas-fired power generators will increase as coal plants shut for
annual maintenance.  
 U.S. power plants often schedule repairs for April and May
after the winter heating season ends and before warm weather
spurs demand for electricity. About 31 percent of gas demand
comes from electricity generators, according to the Energy
Department.  
 “Gas-fired power generation is again picking up share in
the generation stack to the detriment of coal-fired
generation,” said Horwitz. “With this dynamic in play, we
believe gas prices have put in a floor at $4.”  
 U.S. gas inventories rose to 1.829 trillion cubic feet in
the week ended April 16, 19 percent above the five-year average,
the Energy Department reported yesterday. Supplies were 5.5
percent higher than a year ago.  
 Supplies typically increase from April to November as
utilities and other large consumers buy gas for use during the
cold-weather months, when demand exceeds production and imports.  
 U.S. Production  
 U.S. production reached a record 26.4 trillion cubic feet
in 2009, rising 2.4 percent from the previous year, according to
the Energy Department. The increase came as purchases of the
fuel by factories, chemical plants and steel mills declined 7.7
percent during the worst recession since the 1930s. Demand may
increase 2.2 percent this year.  
 Since 2005, total gas output in the U.S. has risen 12
percent, while consumption has advanced 3.8 percent, according
to Energy Department data.  
 Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 11.63 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $4.0661 per
million Btu, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
222,686 contracts as of 2:36 p.m., compared with a three-month
daily average total of 234,000. Volume was 300,623 yesterday.
Open interest was 859,714 contracts, compared with the three-
month average of 824,000. The exchange has a one-business-day
delay in reporting open interest and full volume data.
