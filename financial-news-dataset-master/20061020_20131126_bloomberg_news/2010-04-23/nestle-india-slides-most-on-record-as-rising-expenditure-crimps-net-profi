              Nestle India Ltd., a unit of the
world’s biggest food company, slid the most on record in Mumbai
trading as rising costs crimped profit.  
 The shares tumbled as much as 20 percent before trading 3
percent down at 2,770.5 rupees as of 11:22 a.m. local time,
making it the third-worst performer on the Bombay Stock Exchange
BSE500 Index, which climbed 0.6 percent.  
 “Profit has been a big disappointment although their
revenue is in line,” said Shirish Pardeshi, a Mumbai-based
analyst at Anand Rathi Financial Services Ltd. who recommends
investors sell the shares. “Historically, the first quarter is
the biggest for Nestle.”  
 Net income at the New Delhi-based company rose 3 percent to
2.02 billion rupees ($45 million) in the three months ended
March 31 from 1.97 billion rupees a year ago, the New Delhi-
based company said yesterday in a statement to the Bombay Stock
Exchange. Pardeshi had estimated 2.3 billion rupees.  
 Sales climbed 17 percent to 14.8 billion rupees, while
expenditure rose 22 percent.
