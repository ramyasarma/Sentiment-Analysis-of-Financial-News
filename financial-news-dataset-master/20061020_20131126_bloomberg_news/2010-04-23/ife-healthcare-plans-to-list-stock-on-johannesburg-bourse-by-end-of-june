             Life Healthcare Group Holdings
Ltd., a South African hospital owner, said it plans to start
trading its shares on the stock exchange in Johannesburg by the
end of June.  
 The company, which owns and operates 62 acute care
facilities with about 8,100 beds, plans to list 30 percent of
its securities, the Johannesburg-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. Its share price will be determined
during a book-building exercise, Life Healthcare said.  
 Shareholders in Life Healthcare, including Brimstone
Investment Corp. Ltd. and Mvelaphanda Group Ltd., will sell some
or all of their existing holdings to ensure the company has
enough free shares to trade when it lists, Mvela Group and
Brimstone said in separate statements.  
 Brimstone, which holds 21.65 percent of the company, will
sell 6.1 percent of its stake while Mvela Group will spin off
its 21.65 percent stake in the company. Both companies said they
will use proceeds from the sale of their Life Healthcare shares
to reduce debt.
