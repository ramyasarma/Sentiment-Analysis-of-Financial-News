             U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to work with
Congress to complete Iran sanctions legislation and to work
toward reducing tensions with Israel.  
 “I look forward to working with you to ensure there are no
impediments to swiftly completing this legislation,” Reid wrote
in a letter today to Clinton.  
 Reid also asked Clinton to improve ties with Israel and
encourge the Palestinians and the Israeli government to hold
direct peace talks.
