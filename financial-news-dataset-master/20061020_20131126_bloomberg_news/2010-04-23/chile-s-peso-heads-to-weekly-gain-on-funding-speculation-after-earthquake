             Chile’s peso posted a weekly gain
on speculation insurers sold dollars to buy pesos for repairs
after the Feb. 27 earthquake.  
 The peso rose 0.5 percent this week to 521.05 per U.S.
dollar, from 523.5 on April 16. The currency fell 0.1 percent
today. The peso was the second-best performer this week among 26
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, behind Mexico’s
peso.  
 Chile’s government and insurers may need to buy pesos to
help pay for repairs following the earthquake and tsunami that
killed more than 400 people and caused as much as $30 billion of
damage. The government plans to sell $1 billion of 10-year bonds
as well as $500 million of peso debt internationally, Finance
Minister Felipe Larrain said today.  
 “There was noise that insurance companies were bringing
cash in from abroad to pay for the earthquake,” said David
Duarte, an economist at 4Cast Inc. in New York. “The peso
outperformed while other currencies posted losses, which helped
align the peso with its peers.”
