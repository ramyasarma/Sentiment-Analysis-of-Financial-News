             Greece should be allowed to go
bankrupt as that would be the best way to sort out its finances,
according to Mark Mobius, chairman of Templeton Asset Management
Ltd., as reported in Slovenian business daily Finance  
 “If we pour piles of cash into a country where corruption
extends to top government officials, we won’t see any reforms,”
Mobius told the Ljubljana based paper. “There is no other
solution than to stop financing Greece with creditors taking
responsibility and suffering damages, so countries should help
them, not Greece, limit those damages.”
