             Hog futures fell the most in almost
12 weeks in Chicago on speculation that a rally to the highest
price since 1996 may have been exaggerated. Cattle also dropped.  
 Hog prices failed to top 87.8 cents a pound, the 14-year
high reached yesterday and matched today, spurring some traders
who follow chart patterns to sell futures, said Jim Clarkson at
A&A Trading Inc. Hogs have climbed 19 percent in the past year,
as losses spurred producers to slash herds. The U.S. Department
of Agriculture said yesterday that wholesale-pork prices jumped
to the highest level since August 2008.  
 “We threw some more good news in the market, but couldn’t
take out the contract highs, so it was vulnerable to a little
setback,” said Clarkson, an analyst at A&A in Chicago.  
 Hog futures for June settlement fell 1.775 cents, or 2
percent, to 85.175 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since
Feb. 1. The price slipped 1.1 percent for the week, the first
drop since the five days ended March 26.  
 Hedge funds and other large speculators held record net-
long positions, or bets for a price increase, in hogs as of
April 13, the most-recent Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data show.  
 “It looked to me like an individual trader who had been
long started getting out,” sparking today’s decline, Clarkson
said. “It’s been a big rally, and everybody’s taking a little
profit before the weekend.”  
 Wholesale pork is up 35 percent this year, climbing to
90.68 cents a pound yesterday, the highest in 20 months,
government data show. U.S. stockpiles of frozen pork shrank to
510.5 million pounds on March 31, down 14 percent from a year
earlier, the USDA said yesterday.  
 “Right now, fundamentally, there’s nothing we’re seeing
that justifies that move” lower in hog futures, said Tom
Cawthorne, the director of hog marketing at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates in Chicago.  
 Cattle Market  
 Cattle futures for June delivery slipped 0.775 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 94.825 cents a pound in Chicago. Prices are up 14
percent in the past year. Feeder-cattle futures for August
settlement dropped 0.575 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $1.15575 a
pound.  
 After the close of trading in Chicago, the USDA reported
that feedlots boosted purchases of young cattle by 2.7 percent
from a year earlier. Eleven analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
expected a 6.3 percent increase.  
 Wholesale choice beef climbed 0.5 percent at midday to
$1.6827 a pound, the highest price since July 2008, according to
the USDA. Beef’s 2.7 percent increase this month trails the 25
percent surge in wholesale pork, which may be making some
traders uneasy about prospects for beef demand, said Chad
Henderson, a market analyst with Prime Agricultural Consultants
Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.
