             Schlumberger Ltd., the world’s
largest oilfield contractor, said international profit margins
are poised to rise. The company’s shares gained 6.6 percent.  
 Schlumberger reported today first-quarter net income
dropped to $672 million, or 56 cents a share, from $938 million,
or 78 cents, a year earlier. Excluding 6 cents in costs from
U.S. health-care legislation and planned acquisitions,
Schlumberger earned 62 cents a share, 1 cent higher than the
average of 26 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Andrew Gould, chief executive officer of the Houston- and
Paris-based company, said international profit margins “appear
to have bottomed” earlier than he expected, at 22 percent for
the quarter. Gould previously said they would reach their lowest
point by the middle of the year.
     The margins “are now likely to resume a positive trend -
absent any exceptional circumstances,” Gould told analysts
today in a conference call.  
 Schlumberger rose $4.50 to $72.68 at 4:26 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares earlier reached
$73.19, the largest gain since June. Before today, the shares,
which have 26 buy ratings from analysts, 6 holds and 1 sell, had
risen 4.8 percent this year.  
 “Welcome back into the camp for more bullish people,
Andrew,” Ole Slorer, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York,
told Gould today on the call. “Good to have you back.”  
 Other Gains  
 Other service companies rose because of Gould’s statements,
said Philip Weiss, an analyst at Argus Research in New York, who
rates Schlumberger shares at “sell” and says he owns none.  
 Smith International Inc., a Houston-based company
Schlumberger agreed to buy in February, rose $2.77, or 6
percent, to $48.68. Weatherford International Ltd., based in
Geneva, rose 86 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $17.58. Baker Hughes
Inc., based in Houston, rose $1.66, or 3.2 percent, to $53.46.  
 Schlumberger, which got 80 percent of its oilfield-services
revenue from outside North America, is probably the company best
positioned for international growth, said Kurt Hallead, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Austin, Texas.  
 “The international market is much like a big tractor-
trailer that gets momentum once it starts rolling,” Hallead
said.  
 Sales for Schlumberger dropped 6.7 percent to $5.6 billion.
North American profit margin was 8 percent, more than the 6
percent projected by Hallead.  
 Exceeding Expectations  
 “The performance in North America will exceed investors’
expectations,” Hallead, who rates Schlumberger shares at
“outperform” and owns none, said today in a telephone
interview.  
 Geoff Kieburtz, an analyst at Weeden & Co. in Greenwich,
Connecticut, said international markets appear to be
strengthening.  
 “But also like other service companies, they are
expressing a low level of conviction as to what direction things
take in North America in the second half of the year,” said
Kieburtz, who rates Schlumberger shares a “buy” and owns none.  
 Gould told investors on March 22 that oil prices above $75
a barrel would give customers confidence to increase spending on
exploration. The boost in spending may be more likely for 2011,
he said at the time.  
 Crude Prices  
 Crude-oil futures prices on the New York Mercantile
Exchange have averaged about $80 a barrel so far this year. Oil
and gas producers around the world slashed spending by about 15
percent to $395 billion last year, according to a Dec. 16
estimate by Barclays Capital in New York. Spending should rise
11 percent to $439 billion this year, Barclays said.  
 Schlumberger boosted capital spending for this year by $400
million to about $3.1 billion.  
 Revenue at the company’s largest segment, the oilfield-
services unit, fell 6 percent to $5.1 billion, while sales at
the WesternGeco seismic unit dropped 14 percent to $472 million.  
 The company said its results included $40 million in costs
associated with U.S. health-care legislation and $35 million for
costs from its purchase of Smith International Inc. and
Geoservices.
