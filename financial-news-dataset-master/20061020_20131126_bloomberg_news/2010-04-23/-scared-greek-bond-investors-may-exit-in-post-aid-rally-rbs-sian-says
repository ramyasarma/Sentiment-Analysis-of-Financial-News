             Greek bond investors, “scared
witless” by the recent surge in yields may use any rally in the
securities to sell them, damping their advance, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc said.  
 “Be cognizant of the fact that many investors will have
been scared witless by recent price action and looking at a
rally to exit,” Harvinder Sian, a senior bond strategist at RBS
in London, wrote in an e-mailed report. “Have we seen the peak
on Greek government bond yields of the crisis? Not
necessarily.”
