             Xerox Corp., the largest maker of
high-speed color printers, forecast second-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates as customers renew spending on printing
and office services. The stock rose as much as 8.6 percent.   
 Per-share profit this quarter, excluding some costs, will
be at least 20 cents, Xerox said in a statement today. That
compares with the average analyst estimate of 18 cents in a
Bloomberg survey. First-quarter profit and sales also exceeded
analysts’ projections.  
 Customers are spending more on services to help them manage
documents, after curbing budgets amid the recession. The
rebound, plus a sales boost from the purchase of Affiliated
Computer Services Inc., helped Xerox increase sales 33 percent
last quarter. Xerox also said today that full-year profit will
be at the high end of its forecast.  
 The earnings report was the first since Chief Executive
Officer Ursula Burns completed the $6 billion acquisition of
ACS, the largest in Xerox’s history. She aims to transform the
printer and copier company into a bigger provider of office-
support services. Investors need assurance that cost savings --a
big selling point for the deal -- are under way, said Deutsche
Bank’s Chris Whitmore.  
 “People want to hear tangible evidence of decent
integration coming out of the chute,” said the San Francisco-
based analyst, who rates the shares “hold” and doesn’t own
them. “They need to give people confidence.”  
 Cost Savings  
 Xerox said it’s on track to save at least $100 million this
year, as projected. The company announced 2,500 job cuts last
quarter, leading to an additional $140 million in savings.  
 Xerox, based in Norwalk, Connecticut, rose as high as 
$11.35 in early trading after closing at $10.45 yesterday
on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had climbed 
24 percent this year before today.  
 The first-quarter loss was $42 million, or 4 cents a share,
compared with a profit of $42 million, or 5 cents, a year
earlier. Excluding restructuring and other costs, profit was 18
cents a share, topping the average analyst estimate of 13 cents.
Sales climbed to $4.72 billion from $3.55 billion a year
earlier.  
 The company had forecast full-year profit of 75 cents to 85
cents. Analysts on average estimated 79 cents, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  
 Burns, 51, took over as CEO in July, when Anne Mulcahy
stepped down after eight years at the helm. Burns announced the
ACS deal less than three months later, in an effort to build
Xerox’s services business amid declining sales of printing
equipment. ACS handles accounting, benefits and other
administrative tasks for corporations.  
 After the stock dropped 15 percent the day the deal was
announced, Burns spent the next five months convincing investors
that it could boost services sales and take out costs. When the
deal closed Feb. 8, shares had climbed most of the way back, up
10 percent compared with a decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500
in the same period.
