             The United Arab Emirates’ central
bank told local lenders that they don’t have to book provisions
“at the moment” for loans given to Dubai World, Al-Khaleej
said.  
 The central bank sent a circular telling the banks that
they don’t have to book provisions until more information is
received on how these loans will perform, the newspaper said.  
 State-owned holding company Dubai World and its property
unit Nakheel PJSC are seeking to renegotiate $24.8 billion of
debt after the global credit crisis battered Dubai’s real estate
market and left the emirate’s companies unable to raise loans.
Dubai World asked its almost 100 creditors on March 25 to roll
over liabilities into two new loans of five- and eight-year
maturities.
