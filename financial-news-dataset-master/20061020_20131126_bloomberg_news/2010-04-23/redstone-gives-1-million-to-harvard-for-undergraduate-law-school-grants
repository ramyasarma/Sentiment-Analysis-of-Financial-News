             Harvard University received $1
million from Sumner Redstone, the chairman of Viacom Inc., to
fund scholarships and fellowships at the institution’s law
school and undergraduate college.  
 The donation to Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, will
support 20 undergraduates in the 2010-2011 academic year and
fund 10 post-graduate fellowships in public service for law
students, according to an e-mailed statement from Viacom today.
Redstone also gave $500,000 to Boston Latin School, in Boston,
Viacom said in a separate statement.  
 Redstone, 86, is a graduate of Boston Latin, Harvard
College and Harvard Law School. The Harvard gifts are made to
honor late President John F. Kennedy, and the recipients of the
scholarships will have demonstrated a commitment to public
service that reflects Kennedy’s ideals, according to the
statement. Kennedy graduated from Harvard in 1940 and Redstone
received a bachelor’s degree in 1944, according to John
Longbrake, a Harvard spokesman.  
 “I have established these scholarships to help celebrate
President Kennedy’s spirit by fostering a focus on education and
a renewed commitment to public service,” Redstone said in the
statement.  
 Redstone has been executive chairman of New York-based
Viacom, a producer of television and movie programming, since
2006. He is also chairman of New York-based CBS Corp., which
owns television networks and stations.
