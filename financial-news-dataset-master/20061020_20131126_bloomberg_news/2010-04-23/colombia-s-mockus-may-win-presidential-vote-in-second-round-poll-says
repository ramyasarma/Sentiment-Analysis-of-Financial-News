             Colombia’s Green Party candidate
Antanas Mockus said he may win next month’s presidential
election in the first round after polls showed he could defeat
ex-Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos in a runoff.  
 Mockus would win the election in a second-round ballot with
50 percent support compared with 44 percent for Santos,
according to a poll published last night by Centro Nacional de
Consultoria. The momentum is moving toward a first-round win on
May 30, Mockus said in an interview with CM& Television today.  
 “I don’t see it as too far from a possibility,” Mockus,
58, said after hearing the poll results.  
 The poll said that in a first round vote, Santos and Mockus
would get 35 percent and 34 percent support, respectively, a
result that would force a June 20 runoff. Conservative party
candidate Noemi Sanin would garner 12 percent of the vote, the
poll said. A candidate needs more than 50 percent of the votes
to win the election in the first round.  
 The survey of 1,000 people in 38 cities was taken between
April 19 and April 21 and had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.
