             Toronto-Dominion Bank Chief
Executive Officer Ed Clark told CNBC that banks’ capital ratios
should be raised as part of an overhaul of financial rules.  
 Clark, along with the CEOs of Canada’s five other main
banks, wrote an article published in the Financial Times
newspaper this week urging policy makers to speed up reforms and
to set a common standard among banks for capital requirements.
