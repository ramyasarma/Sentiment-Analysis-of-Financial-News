             France’s Conseil D’Etat ruled
against an attempt by M6-Metropole Television SA to suspend
acquisitions by Societe Television Francaise 1, Le Figaro
reported, without citing anyone.   
 The Conseil d’Etat, which has jurisdiction over decisions
made by government bodies, still has to examine the substance of
M6’s complaint against TF1’s purchases of digital television
stations TMC and NT1, the newspaper said.
