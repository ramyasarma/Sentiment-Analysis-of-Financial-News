             Etihad Airways lost $30 million
because of the ban on flights to Europe caused by the volcanic
ash clouds, Chief Executive Officer James Hogan said in an
interview to the United Arab Emirates news agency WAM.  
 Etihad had to pay for the accommodation of 2,500 passengers
stranded in Abu Dhabi, he said, according to WAM.
