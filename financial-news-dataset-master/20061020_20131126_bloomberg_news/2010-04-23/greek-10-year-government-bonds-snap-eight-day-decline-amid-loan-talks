             Greek two-year notes fell, capping
the biggest weekly increase in yields on record, after a
government request for aid failed to assuage concern that
bondholders will be asked to accept delayed or reduced payments.  
 The declines pushed up the yield to near yesterday’s 11-
year high. The notes rose earlier, driving the yield down as
much as 1 percentage point before the announcement. Prime
Minister George Papandreou said he gave the Finance Ministry a
mandate to ask the European Union today to release the aid. The
Greek request needs approval from all 15 other euro-area
countries including Germany, where surveys have shown public
opposition to aiding Greece.  
 “These measures push the problem forward,” said Mark
Schofield, head of interest-rate strategy at Citigroup Global
Markets Ltd. in London. “This is just sticking plaster, and
there will have to be some kind of restructuring of their
debt.”  
 Greek two-year yields climbed 30 basis points to 10.9
percent as of 5:32 p.m. in London, bringing the advance to 373
basis points in the week. The yield earlier declined to 9.63
percent. The 4.3 percent security due March 2012 slid 0.44, or
4.4 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,334) face amount, to 89.16. The
price tumbled 58.8 euros in the five days. Greek 10-year yields
dropped 17 basis points to 8.81 percent.  
 The yield premium, or spread, investors demand to hold
Greek 10-year bonds instead of German bunds, Europe’s benchmark
government security, fell 17 basis points to 562 basis points.
The spread tumbled earlier from as high as 590 basis points to
491 basis points as news of the Greek request for the EU-led, 45
billion-euro aid package emerged.  
 ‘No Response’  
 “There was no response from the markets, either because
they didn’t believe in the political will of the EU or because
they decided to go on with speculation,” Prime Minister George
Papandreou said today, referring to the earlier decision by the
EU this month to offer the rescue package. “The situation
threatens to demolish not only the sacrifices of the people but
also the regular course of the economy. All the efforts by the
Greek people are in danger of being in vain.”  
 European policy makers have so far only spelled out the aid
that Greece would receive over the next year, sparking concerns
about how the country will finance itself beyond 2011. While
Greece has pledged to lower its budget deficit below the EU’s 3
percent limit by 2012, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says the
country’s challenge is so great the nation may cut or delay
payments to bond investors.  
 German Bonds  
 German two-year notes fell for the first time in three days
as a report showed the nation’s business confidence rose to a
two-year high in April and European industrial orders climbed in
February. The yield rose 4 basis points to 0.90 percent, while
the 10-year yields was little changed at 3.06 percent. Both
securities advanced in the week amid mounting investor concern
about a Greek default.  
 The Ifo institute said its business climate index, based on
a survey of 7,000 executives in Germany, climbed to 101.6, from
98.2 in March, the highest reading since May 2008. Orders to
industrial companies in the 16-nation euro area increased 1
percent from January, according to the EU statistics office in
Luxembourg.  
 Greek government bonds lost more than 13 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German debt returned
3.3 percent in the period, with U.S. Treasuries rising 1.5
percent, the indexes showed.
