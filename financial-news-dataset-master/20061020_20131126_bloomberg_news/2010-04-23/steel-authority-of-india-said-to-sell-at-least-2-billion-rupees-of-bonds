             Steel Authority of India Ltd., the
nation’s second-largest producer, plans to sell at least 2
billion rupees ($45 million) of 10-year bonds, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  
 The state-controlled steelmaker, based in New Delhi, has an
option to increase the issuance and plans to price the notes to
yield between 8.55 percent and 8.75 percent, one of the people
said, declining to be identified because the transaction is
private. A Steel Authority spokeswoman did not immediately reply
to an e-mail seeking comment.
