             Orders for long-lasting goods
probably climbed in March for a fourth consecutive month, while
sales of new homes increased from a record low, pointing to an
uneven U.S. recovery.  
 Bookings for durable goods rose 0.2 percent after a 0.9
percent February gain, according to the median forecast of 75
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. New-home purchases
advanced 5.5 percent to a 325,000 annual rate from the prior
month, another report may show.  
 Eaton Corp. is among companies that may see sales grow as
the global economic rebound propels exports, and rising profits
spur investments in new equipment. Meanwhile, a government tax
credit may give housing a lift in coming months that will
require gains in employment in order to be sustained.  
 “The news on the manufacturing sector continues to be
quite good,” said Julia Coronado, a senior economist at BNP
Paribas in New York. “While manufacturing is the leading
sector, housing is certainly the lagging sector.”  
 The Commerce Department’s figures on durable goods are due
at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. Projections ranged from a gain of
2.5 percent to a 1.6 percent drop.  
 The increases in durable goods orders would mark the most
successive gains since 2005, confirming the role of
manufacturing in spearheading the expansion.  
 Orders excluding transportation equipment, a less volatile
category, probably rose 0.7 percent after climbing 1.4 percent
in February, according to the survey median.  
 Home Sales  
 The new-homes sales data will be released by the Commerce
Department at 10 a.m. Estimates ranged from 300,000 to 362,000.  
 Factories are ramping up output as improving economies from
Brazil to China and India boost overseas sales and rising U.S.
demand prompts companies to update equipment and replenish
stockpiles after last year’s record drawdown.  
 Exports rose in February to the highest level since October
2008, the Commerce Department reported last week. Manufacturing
last month expanded at the fastest pace since 2004, according to
a survey of purchasing managers.  
 Eaton, the Cleveland-based maker of engine valves and
transmissions, this week posted first-quarter profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates and raised its 2010 earnings
forecast as demand increased for car and truck parts.  
 “The expanding world economy drove growth in most of our
markets,” Chief Executive Officer Sandy Cutler said in a
statement. “We are seeing the strongest growth in Asia and
Brazil, while many U.S. markets are starting to accelerate and
Europe is recovering more modestly.”  
 Shares Rally  
 The S&P Supercomposite Machinery Index, which includes
Caterpillar Inc. and Deere & Co., is up 19.6 percent since Dec.
31, more than double the 8.4 percent gain in the broader S&P 500
Index.  
 Reports last week showed builders turned less pessimistic
in April and housing starts for March were at the highest level
in more than a year.  
 Sales of previously owned houses rose in March for the
first time in four months, the National Association of Realtors
reported yesterday.  
 The Obama administration extended a credit for first-time
homebuyers in November and expanded it to include some current
owners. The deadline for signing purchase contracts is the end
of this month, and transactions must be completed by June 30.  
 After that, the state of the labor market, mortgage rates
and developments surrounding foreclosures, which are depressing
property values and adding to already bloated inventories, will
determine the fate of the housing industry, said Aaron Smith, a
senior economist at Moody’s Economy.com in West Chester,
Pennsylvania.

     Sales of U.S. previously owned homes rose in March for the first time in four months as buyers took advantage of a government tax credit and the weather improved. (Source: Bloomberg)
