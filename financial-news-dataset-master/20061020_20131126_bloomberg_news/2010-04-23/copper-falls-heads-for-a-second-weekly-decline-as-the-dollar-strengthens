             Copper fell in New York and London,
heading for a second weekly drop as the dollar climbed further
on concern about sovereign finances in Europe.  
 The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, rose for a seventh day, gaining as much as
0.6 percent. The gauge yesterday posted its biggest intraday
climb in a month as the European Union said Greece’s 2009 budget
deficit was wider than estimated by the government and Moody’s
Investors Service cut the country’s credit rating.  
 “We would not be surprised to see the dollar continue to
strengthen in the weeks ahead as attention moves away from
Greece to other countries with similarly weak deficit
profiles,” analyst Edward Meir at MF Global Inc. said in an e-
mailed report today.  
 Copper for July delivery fell 1.6 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$3.4905 a pound at 8:52 a.m. on the Comex in New York, extending
this week’s retreat to 1.3 percent. The metal for delivery in
three months slipped 0.3 percent to $7,670 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange.  
 The dollar index has advanced 1.2 percent this week,
heading for April’s first weekly gain. A stronger dollar makes
metals priced in the currency more expensive in terms of other
monies.  
 Chinese Growth  
 “Dollar strength should deter any meaningful rallies in
commodities from setting in over the short term, and instead may
increase the odds for a rather sharp break to the downside,”
Meir said.  
 Prices also have retreated this week on concern about
efforts by China, the world’s biggest copper consumer, to cool
economic growth. Officials ordered developers not to take
deposits for sales of uncompleted apartments without proper
approval and clamped down on loans for third-home purchases to
cool rising prices.  
 Construction uses a quarter of all the copper produced,
according to the Copper Development Association.  
 “Curbs in China, coupled with weakness in Europe,” may
cause copper to drop further, Nick Moore, an analyst at RBS
Global Banking & Markets in London, said by phone. “We think we
are going to see markedly lower imports” of metal into the
Asian nation, he said.  
 Top Performer  
 Copper shipments into China rose to a record in 2009’s
first half, helping prices to more than double for the year.
Prices have gained 4.3 percent in 2010 on the LME, compared with
the 44 percent jump for nickel, this year’s top performer among
the six main metals traded on the exchange.  
 Comex prices will average $3.44 a pound ($7,584 a ton) this
year before rising to $3.70 next year, Bart Melek, a commodity
strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a report dated
yesterday. He cited “double-digit growth in China, aggressive
restocking and a stronger-than-expected recovery in global
industrial activity.”  
 Stockpiles of the metal monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange have surged 97 percent this year, and stood at 187,907
tons this week, the highest level since at least 2003.  
 Copper inventories tracked by the LME were little changed
today at 507,150 tons. They fell 0.4 percent this week, the
ninth drop in a row. Bookings to remove metal from inventories
dropped 2.2 percent to 22,200 tons today.  
 Zinc for three-month delivery on the LME declined 1.4
percent to $2,385 a ton. Stockpiles in Shanghai warehouses rose
to a record 256,334 tons this week. Including LME inventories,
stocks are up 21 percent this year.  
 Nickel slid 1.6 percent to $26,660 a ton and tin gained 0.3
percent to $18,950 a ton. Aluminum fell 0.8 percent to $2,300.50
a ton and lead dropped 1.4 percent to $2,275 a ton.
