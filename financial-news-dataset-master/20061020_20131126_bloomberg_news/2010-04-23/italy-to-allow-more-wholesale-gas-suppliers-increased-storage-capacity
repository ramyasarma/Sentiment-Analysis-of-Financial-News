             Italy’s Cabinet passed a decree to
allow more wholesale gas suppliers and increased storage,
Industry Minister Claudio Scajola said.  
 “This measure will combine greater infrastructure
development with the lowering of gas prices,” Scajola said in a
statement e-mailed after a Cabinet meeting in Rome today. “The
measures will allow the construction of structures essential to
the gas market, providing benefits before next winter.”  
 The decree, which will be reviewed by Parliament, envisions
dominant gas importers while opening gas storage to competition.
When supplies exceed the needs of the main suppliers, the fuel
may be sold and distributed by smaller operators, according to
the statement.
