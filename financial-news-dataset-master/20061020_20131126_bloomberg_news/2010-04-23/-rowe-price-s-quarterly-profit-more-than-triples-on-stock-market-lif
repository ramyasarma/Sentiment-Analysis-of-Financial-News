             T. Rowe Price Group Inc., the asset
manager that has posted a profit every quarter since going
public in 1986, said first-quarter earnings more than tripled as
it recorded record investor inflows.  
 Net income climbed to $153 million, or 57 cents a share,
from $48.2 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier, the Baltimore-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts estimated a
profit of 58 cents a share, according to the average of 19
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Money managers benefited from a 52 percent gain in the MSCI
AC World Index of global stock markets in the year ended March
31, as a higher asset base generated more fees from managing
investments. T. Rowe clients responded by making $10.3 billion
in deposits, more than in any other quarter.  
 “Performance remains strong across the franchise, and
first-quarter flows are typically good as relates to retirement
accounts,” Michael Kim, an analyst with Sandler O’Neill &
Partners LP in New York, said in an interview before the results
were announced. He forecast T. Rowe Price to earn 57 cents a
share, rating it as “hold.”  
 Revenue increased 45 percent to $556.2 million, driven by a
54 percent jump in investment advisory fees to $471.8 million.
Expenses rose 16 percent as compensation and related costs
increased 18 percent to $207.7 million.  
 Market Appreciation  
 Assets under management increased 56 percent from a year
earlier to $419 billion. In the three months ended March 31,
assets rose 27.7 billion, or 7.1 percent. Market appreciation
added $17.4 billion.  
 T. Rowe’s mutual funds recorded $6.1 billion in net
inflows, including $3.4 billion to stock funds, up from $800
million in the previous quarter. Bond funds added $3 billion,
while investors withdrew $300 million from money-market funds.  
 “The mix has been switching subtly, but the trend is
moving more into equities than fixed-income,” James Kennedy,
chief executive officer of the company, said today in a
telephone interview. Investors remain “fickle” as April fund
flows have been about evenly divided between stocks and bonds,
he said.  
 Accounts for institutional customers and wealthy
individuals took in $4.2 billion, primarily from financial firms
outside the U.S., the company said. Investors based outside the
U.S. account for 12 percent of T. Rowe’s assets.  
 Target-date retirement funds gathered a net $2.4 billion.
They now represent 12 percent of the firm’s assets and 19
percent of its mutual funds.  
 In the five years ended March 31, 90 percent of T. Rowe
funds beat the average return of funds in their Lipper peer
groups, and 83 percent outperformed in the past three years.  
 ‘Weren’t Sucked In’  
 “We weren’t sucked in by the subprime world,” Kennedy
said. “Over time if you can avoid the big mistakes you can do
huge favors for your clients.”  
 The company completed its purchase of a 26 percent stake in
UTI Asset Management Co., India’s oldest money manager, in
January. The deal, announced in November, gives T. Rowe Price
access to a market where mutual-fund assets rose fivefold in
five years.  
 T. Rowe Price fell 21 cents to $58.77 at 9:40 a.m. in
Nasdaq stock market trading. The company had risen 11 percent
this year through yesterday, matching the gain for Standard &
Poor’s 15-member index of asset managers and custody banks.
