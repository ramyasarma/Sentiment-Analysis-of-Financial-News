             German stocks advanced, rebounding
from two days of losses, as Adidas AG raised its full-year
earnings forecast and a report showed business confidence in
Germany at a two-year high.  
 Adidas, the world’s second-largest sporting-goods maker,
surged 3.9 percent as it said profit rose for the first time in
five quarters. MAN SE, Europe’s third-biggest truckmaker,
rallied 4.6 percent after Swedish rival Volvo AB reported first-
quarter results that surpassed analysts’ estimates.  
 The benchmark DAX Index climbed 1.5 percent to 6,259.53,
bringing the weekly gain to 1.3 percent. The measure has risen
5.1 percent this year on signs the global economy is rebounding
from the worst recession since World War II. The broader HDAX
Index also advanced 1.5 percent today.  
 “I’m not surprised that Germany is doing well today,”
said Peter Braendle, who helps oversee about $50 billion at
Swisscanto Asset Management in Zurich. “It is the most cyclical
market in Europe. The strong Ifo figure shows there is a
recovery going on. Volvo results were also excellent and the
German market is profiting from this.”  
 German business confidence rose more than economists
forecast in April as the global economic recovery boosted export
demand and warmer weather allowed workers back onto construction
sites. The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, jumped to 101.6
from 98.2 in March. That’s the highest reading since May 2008.
Economists expected a gain to 98.7, according to the median of
37 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Adidas, MAN  
 Adidas soared 3.9 percent to 44.495 euros. The company now
forecasts full-year earnings per share of 2.05 euros to 2.30
euros, compared with a previous projection for profit on that
basis of 1.90 euros to 2.15 euros. First-quarter net income was
168 million euros ($223 million).  
 MAN rallied 4.6 percent to 70.14 euros. Volvo, the world’s
second-largest truckmaker, reported first-quarter net income of
1.68 billion kronor ($230 million). Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had forecast a loss of 8.25 million kronor.  
 MAN had a first-quarter operating profit of about 120
million euros and sales reached about 3 billion euros, Platow
Brief reported, without saying where it got the information. The
company will say growth was driven by its Brazilian unit when it
releases figures on April 29, the newsletter reported.  
 BMW Sales  
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the world’s largest luxury-car
maker, climbed 2.8 percent to 37.28 euros. The company raised
its 2010 China sales target to 120,000 units from an earlier
100,000 units, Chief Executive Officer Norbert Reithofer told
reporters at the Beijing Auto Show.  
 Daimler AG increased 2.7 percent to 38.87 euros, rebounding
from yesterday’s 1.6 percent fall. Sales in China may exceed
100,000 units this year, CEO Dieter Zetsche said at the Beijing
Auto Show. It’s also “not impossible” that Mercedes could
surpass BMW’s sales in China this year, he said.  
 BASF SE rose 3.4 percent to 47.75 euros, the largest gain
since November. The world’s biggest chemicals company is raising
its prices for all paper and board dispersions in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa by as much as 20 percent, with immediate
effect, the company said in a statement on its Web site, citing
a “dramatic increase in raw material costs.”  
 Salzgitter AG, Germany’s second-biggest steelmaker, may
have to lower its profit target as the prices of iron ore, coal
and scrap metal rise, Financial Times Deutschland reported,
citing CEO Wolfgang Leese. The shares fell 2.1 percent to 63.94
euros, extending yesterday’s 2.2 percent slide.  
 Axel Springer AG, Europe’s biggest newspaper publisher,
tumbled 2 percent to 89.90 euros after the company said it plans
to place as many as 2.93 million shares with institutional
investors.
