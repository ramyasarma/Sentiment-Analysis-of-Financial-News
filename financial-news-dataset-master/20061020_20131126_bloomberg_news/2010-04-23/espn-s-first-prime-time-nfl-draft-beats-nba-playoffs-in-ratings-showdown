             The National Football League
draft’s move to prime time led to a 26 percent increase in
preliminary television ratings for ESPN, beating the National
Basketball Association playoffs.  
 The opening round of the draft, in its first showing at
night after being held on Saturday afternoons, was seen on the
Walt Disney Co. network in 5.4 percent of households in the top
56 U.S. television markets, ESPN spokesman Bill Hofheimer said
in an e-mail. That’s a 26 percent increase over the 4.3 rating
for an almost equal-length first round a year ago.  
 The draft, which started last night at Radio City Music
Hall in New York City, also was shown on the NFL Network, as it
was last year.  
 There were two NBA first-round playoff games on Time Warner
Inc.’s TNT last night. The Chicago Bulls’ 108-106 win over the
Cleveland Cavaliers in an early game drew a 2.1 preliminary
rating, and in later action the Oklahoma City Thunder’s 101-96
win over the Los Angeles Lakers drew a 3.0, Turner spokesman
Jeff Pomeroy said in an e-mail.  
 The St. Louis Rams selected University of Oklahoma
quarterback Sam Bradford with the first pick of the draft,
Nebraska defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh went second to the
Detroit Lions and Oklahoma’s Gerald McCoy, also a defensive
tackle, was drafted third by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  
 Rounds 2 and 3 will be held tonight and the completion of
the seven-round draft will take place tomorrow afternoon.
