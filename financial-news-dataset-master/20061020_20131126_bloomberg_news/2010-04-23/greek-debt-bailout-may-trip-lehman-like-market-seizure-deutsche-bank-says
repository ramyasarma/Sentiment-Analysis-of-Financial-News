             Financial markets face the risk of
a seizure similar to when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. went
bankrupt if Greece restructures its debt to the detriment of
investors, Deutsche Bank AG said.  
 The surge in the cost of insuring the country from default
shows traders aren’t convinced Greece will get a full bailout,
Jim Reid, head of fundamental strategy at Deutsche Bank, wrote
today in a report. A restructuring of Greek’s debt, while
unlikely in the short-term, would have “huge ramifications”
for global financial markets, he wrote.  
 “As soon as you set a restructuring template for stressed
sovereigns, then you run a huge risk of a Lehman-type event with
confidence in other stressed sovereigns evaporating,” including
Portugal, Ireland and Spain, Reid wrote. “It’s not just Greece
that needs the bail-out, the others need it as a first line of
defense.”  
 Greece is prepared to ask euro-region governments for a
bridge loan as $11.3 billion in bonds come due next month and
borrowing costs surge to the highest level since 1998. The
nation is trying to hammer out terms of a 45 billion-euro ($60
billion) aid package with the European Union and International
Monetary Fund.  
 “A restructuring might be argued to be the best solution
in isolation and may be needed longer-term, but we can’t see the
authorities being prepared for the consequences of this anytime
soon,” Reid wrote. “This situation is coming to a head in a
nasty manner.”  
 Lehman Brothers, once the world’s fourth-biggest investment
bank, filed the biggest U.S. bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008,
sending markets worldwide into a tailspin. Global stocks plunged
40 percent within two months, the once $2.2 trillion U.S.
commercial paper market seized up and the extra yield investors
demand to own corporate bonds soared to record levels.  
 Greece is likely to cut or delay payments to bond investors
even as the country negotiates a bailout package to help it
combat a budget deficit of 13.6 percent of gross domestic
product, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  
 Credit-default swaps on Greece’s bonds climbed 11.5 basis
points to 645.5 today, according to CMA DataVision prices.
