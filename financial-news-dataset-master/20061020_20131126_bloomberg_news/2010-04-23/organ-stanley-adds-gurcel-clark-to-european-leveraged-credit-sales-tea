             Morgan Stanley hired two bankers
for its European leveraged credit sales team.  
 Matthew Clark, who joins from UniCredit SpA, will focus on
collateralized loan obligations and bank loan sales, according
to Hugh Fraser, a London-based spokesman for Morgan Stanley.
Julien Gurcel, previously at HSBC Holdings Plc, joins as an
executive director. Both will be based in London and report to
Geoff Drayson.  
 Collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, pool leveraged
loans, channeling their income into securities of varying risk
and return.
