             Investigators probing the crash of
Air France Flight 447 said they may ask for more funds after
failing to find the flight recorders in a first sweep of the
search area.
     France’s BEA air-accident investigation bureau plans to
return its two sonar vessels to the Brazilian port of Recife
next week before deciding whether and where to conduct further
searches, spokeswoman Martine Del Bono said by telephone.
    Additional searches would take the cost of the operation
“beyond the original 10 million euros” provided by Air France
and Airbus, Del Bono said. “The funding question will be raised
after we’ve looked at the technical case” for a return to the
crash area, she said.
