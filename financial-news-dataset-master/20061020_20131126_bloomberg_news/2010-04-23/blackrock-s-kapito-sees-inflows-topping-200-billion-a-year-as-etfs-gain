             BlackRock Inc.  may average more
than $200 billion in annual investor deposits over the next five
years after the acquisition of Barclays Global Investors added
passive funds, said  Robert Kapito , the firm’s president.  
 Net new business at the world’s largest money manager,
which oversees $3.35 trillion, may grow at a rate of 5 percent
to 6 percent,  Kapito  said in an interview from his New York
office. The numbers don’t include market appreciation.  
 “We have the largest distribution force in the asset-
management business so I think we certainly can do that,” said
Kapito, 52. “We expect to see growth in the passive and the
iShares business -- those two are getting a lion’s share of the
money -- and the alternatives business,” said Kapito, who along
with Chief Executive Officer  Laurence D. Fink  is a co-founder of
New York-based BlackRock.  
 BlackRock, started in 1988 as a fixed-income manager, on
Dec. 1 completed its acquisition of Barclays Plc’s fund unit to
become the largest investment firm. The $15.2 billion purchase,
the biggest to combine an active manager with one that oversees
passive investments, enabled BlackRock to add the iShares
exchange-traded funds and other index-tracking products that are
gaining popularity with investors.  
 BlackRock, which is scheduled to report  first-quarter
earnings  before the market opens on April 26, told analysts that
clients had agreed to invest $38 billion in its funds this year
as of Jan. 21. Had BlackRock owned BGI for all of 2009, the
inflow for the combined company would have been $144.1 billion,
regulatory filings show. Industry flows slowed last year after
the stock-market plunge.  
 Profit May Triple  
 “The ETF and passive business should drive a lot of flows,
and alternatives are in recovery mode,”  Jeffrey Hopson , an
analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in St. Louis, said in an
interview. Hopson, who rates the shares “buy,” expects
BlackRock to reap about $200 billion a year in net deposits.  
 BlackRock is likely to report quarterly profit that more
than tripled from a year earlier, based on the average estimate
of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. BlackRock will earn $2.46
per share, excluding certain items, compared with 81 cents in
the year-earlier period, according to the average estimate.  
 Investors are too optimistic about profit contributed by
BlackRock’s acquisition of BGI, according to  William Katz , an
analyst at New York-based Citigroup Inc. who issued Wall
Street’s first “sell” rating on the company April 1. Plowing
back savings from the BGI merger into growth initiatives may
crimp the company’s bottom line this year and lead to
disappointment among investors who have ratcheted up their
earnings expectations, Katz said.  
 Kapito said the firm’s ETFs and hedge-fund products are
benefiting from investor appetite for a “barbell” strategy
that entails putting a portion of money into passive investments
that mimic indexes and part of it into funds designed to
generate “alpha,” or higher returns than market benchmarks.  
 IShares ETFs  
 Exchange-traded fund assets in the U.S. surged 67 percent
to $750 billion in the year ended in February, according to data
from the Investment Company Institute in Washington, as
investors sought low-cost alternatives to active funds. Mutual
funds in the U.S. held $10.97 trillion as of February, according
to the ICI.  
 BlackRock’s iShares unit is the largest seller of ETFs,
with $509 billion in assets as of March 31. Alternative
strategies such as hedge funds account for $102 billion.  
 After expanding its equity business with the 2006 purchase
of Merrill Lynch & Co.’s money-management unit, BlackRock has
about 45 percent of its assets, or $1.5 trillion, in stock
funds. BlackRock’s stock funds alone hold as much in assets as
Boston-based Fidelity Investments, which managed $1.5 trillion
as of Dec. 31. BlackRock has about a third in bonds, placing it
ahead of rival Pacific Investment Management Co.  
 Executive Departures  
 The BGI acquisition hasn’t prompted significant client
defections at BlackRock, Kapito said. BlackRock’s customer-
retention rate across the firm has been about 99 percent, he
said.  
 Some executives have left BlackRock since the acquisition.
 Kristi Mitchem , a former managing director in BlackRock’s
retirement unit, departed last month to join State Street Corp.
 Scott Amero , the former co-head of BlackRock’s fixed-income
unit, stepped down earlier this year to spend more time with his
family.  
 “There is always a group of people that decide that this
is an opportunity to reflect on their lives, if they want to go
forward in a new organization or not,” Kapito said. Some
executives also left after they got an opportunity to cash out
equity stakes in the company, Kapito said.
