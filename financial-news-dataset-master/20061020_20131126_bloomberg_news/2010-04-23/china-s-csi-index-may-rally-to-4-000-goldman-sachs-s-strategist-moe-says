             China’s stocks may rally 25 percent
by the end of the year on higher earnings and the prospect a
stronger yuan will allow for an earlier end to the tightening
cycle, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Timothy Moe.  
 “The risk reward is pretty good even though we may have to
endure a little bit more uncertainty in terms of the policy
tightening cycle,” Moe, Hong Kong-based chief Asian strategist
at Goldman Sachs, said on Bloomberg Television. A gain in the
yuan means tightening is “closer to the end rather than to the
beginning” and is a “powerful signal for people to become more
constructive on equities on a broader basis,” he said.  
 The nation’s equities have fallen this year on concern an
exit from government stimulus and measures to curb record
property-price gains will hurt economic growth. The Shanghai
Composite index has slumped 8.8 percent in 2010, the world’s
fifth-worst performer.  
 The CSI 300 Index, which tracks stocks on the Shanghai and
Shenzhen exchanges, may slide to 2,900 points before reaching
4,000 by the end of the year, Moe said. The measure fell 0.1
percent to 3,196.97 as of the 11:30 a.m. local-time break.  
 Shares on the CSI 300 trade at 18.2 times this year’s
estimated earnings, compared with 52 times at its record in
October 2007, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Valuations have “compressed significantly” while
companies are growing their profits “comfortably,” Moe said.  
 Regional equity markets may benefit when China allows its
currency to appreciate, according to Moe.  
 Yuan forwards headed for a weekly gain as central bankers
in India and Brazil joined the International Monetary Fund and
European Union in backing a stronger Chinese currency.
