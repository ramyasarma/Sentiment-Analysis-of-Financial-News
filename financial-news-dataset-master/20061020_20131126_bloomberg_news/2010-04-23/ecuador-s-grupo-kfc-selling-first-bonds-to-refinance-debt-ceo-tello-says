             INT Food Services Corp., the
operator of restaurant franchises including KFC and Cinnabon in
Ecuador, will sell its first bonds on the nation’s securities
exchanges next week to refinance existing debt.  
 INT Food Services, known as Grupo KFC, plans to issue $20
million in bonds in two series of $10 million each at two
percentage points above the nation’s variable passive interest
rate, currently at 4.86 percent, Franklin Tello, the company’s
chief executive officer, said today in an interview in Quito.  
 The bonds will be used to refinance the company’s debt,
with half of the first $10 million maturing in 1080 days and the
other half in 1800 days, Tello said. The first series of bonds
will be issued on April 28, and the company has already pre-sold
about $5 million, he said.  
 “We think the first series will fly, and if it does well
we’ll launch the second series immediately,” Tello said in an
interview at the Club de la Union, a social club in the
capital’s financial district. “Demand is extremely high.”  
 Demand for corporate bonds in Ecuador exceeds supply
because new central bank regulations are forcing lenders to
increase the amount of deposits they hold domestically, boosting
liquidity in the South American country and spurring demand for
fixed-income instruments, Tello said.
