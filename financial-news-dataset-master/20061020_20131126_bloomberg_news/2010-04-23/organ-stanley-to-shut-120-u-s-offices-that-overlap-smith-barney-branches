             Morgan Stanley, the world’s largest
brokerage, will probably close 120 additional U.S. offices to
eliminate overlapping locations in its joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.’s Smith Barney.  
 U.S. outlets will shrink to around 750, the unit’s
president, Charles Johnston, said today in an interview at an
industry conference in New York. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney had
870 domestic locations as of March 31, down from 958 on June 30,
2009. The timing of some decisions will be driven by the
branches’ leases, which are often 10-year terms, Johnston said.  
 “There’s overlap in just about every market in the country
between Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley offices,” Johnston
said. “There’s no grand plan to dramatically shrink the
footprint, but there’s an awful lot of no-brainer decisions when
you do a deal like this.”  
 Morgan Stanley’s global wealth-management unit reported
pretax income of $278 million for the first quarter, compared
with $119 million in same period a year earlier, before the
joint venture was completed. Chief Executive Officer James
Gorman, who led the unit before succeeding John Mack in January,
said in a letter to shareholders earlier this month that the
joint venture will play “an increasingly important role in our
growth and profitability.”  
 Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will look to expand outside the
U.S. because those markets are set to grow faster, Johnston
said.  
 ‘Organic Growth’  
 “We don’t have a large enough footprint in those
markets,” Johnston said. “We’d like it to be bigger, and
there’s only two ways to do that -- you can buy something or you
can grow organically. There hasn’t been much that’s been
available to buy. We’ve talked about some deals, but we’re going
on the path of organic growth.”  
 The unit had 18,140 advisers as of March 31 as turnover was
at “historic lows,” Johnston said. He said the number of
advisers will likely stay around 18,000 and revenue growth will
come from increases in adviser productivity.  
 The wealth-management unit had $3.11 billion in revenue,
down from $3.14 billion in the fourth quarter. The brokerage’s
pretax profit margin was 9 percent, up from 7 percent in the
fourth quarter. Gorman has said the firm expects to increase
that margin to 15 percent by the end of this year and more than
20 percent by the end of 2011. Net new client assets in the unit
were $5.8 billion, the highest since the third quarter of 2008.
