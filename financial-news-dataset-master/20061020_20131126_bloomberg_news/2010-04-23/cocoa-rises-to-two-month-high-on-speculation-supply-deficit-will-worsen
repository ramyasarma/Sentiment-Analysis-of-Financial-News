             Cocoa rose to the highest price in
more than two months on speculation that a global production
shortfall will worsen as demand strengthens. Coffee also gained.  
 Output will trail consumption by 124,000 metric tons in the
year ending Sept. 30, compared with a March estimate of 110,000
ton, Fortis Bank Nederland NV and VM Group said today in a
report. The world’s cocoa-bean processors may grind almost 3.6
million tons in the period, up 3.3 percent.  
 “The wider deficit is largely the result of an across-the-
board rise in grindings for all regions save Africa,” Fortis
and VM said. They cited “very strong” evidence that demand
from processors is rebounding from a drop of more than 6 percent
last year.  
 Cocoa for July delivery rose $59, or 1.9 percent, to $3,198
a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after touching $3,211,
the highest price for a most-active contract since Jan. 29. The
7 percent gain this week was the biggest since October.  
 In London, cocoa for May delivery gained 1.8 percent to
2,305 pounds ($3,543) a ton on the Liffe exchange, after
touching 2,320 pounds, the highest level since Feb. 15.  
 “The market gains are being supported by reports of below-
average rainfall for the first 20 days of April in Ivory Coast’s
main growing regions,” Luis A. Rangel, an ICAP Futures trader
in Jersey City, New Jersey, said yesterday in a report. “A
recent dry spell in Nigeria was also becoming a concern.”  
 Ivory Coast is the world’s largest cocoa producer, followed
by Ghana, Indonesia and Nigeria.  
 Rising Demand  
 First-quarter cocoa grindings in North America rose 16
percent from a year earlier, the National Confectioners
Association said on April 15. In Europe, usage jumped 8.1
percent, according to the European Cocoa Association.  
 The chocolate ingredient has jumped 30 percent from a year
earlier in New York. London futures have climbed 25 percent in
the past year, including a 5.7 percent gain this week, the
biggest advance since Nov. 20.  
 Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery rose 0.5 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $1.3195 a pound on ICE, leaving the price up 0.9
percent for the week. The commodity has increased 12 percent in
the past year.  
 On Liffe, robusta coffee for July delivery added $5, or 0.4
percent, to $1,336 a ton. The price has dropped 10 percent in
the past 12 months.
