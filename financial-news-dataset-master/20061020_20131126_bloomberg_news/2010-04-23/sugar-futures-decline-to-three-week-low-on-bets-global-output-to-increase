             Sugar slid to a three-week low in
New York on forecasts for favorable weather in India, the
world’s second-biggest producer.  
 Rains from June to September may be 98 percent of the 50-
year average, the India Meteorological Department, said today.
Sugar prices more than doubled last year as excess precipitation
in Brazil, the leading producer, and a weak monsoon in India,
the top consumer, curbed output.  
 “Normal rains in India are not good for sugar prices,”
said Ricardo Scaff, a commodity trader at Rabobank Nederland
from London. “The fundamentals are weak.”  
 Raw sugar for July delivery fell 0.39 cent, or 2.4 percent,
to 15.75 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. Earlier, the price
touched 15.55 cents, the lowest level since April 1. The
commodity dropped 2.7 percent this week and is down 42 percent
in 2010.  
 White-sugar futures for August delivery dropped $5.30, or
1.1 percent, to $481.80 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in
London, the fourth consecutive drop.  
 Imports by Russia next month may not be as high as
forecast, Scaff said. The duty on shipments will probably be
$120 a ton, compared with an initial indication of $50, Customs
Union Commission data showed.  
 Russia may purchase at least 1 million tons in May, the
International Sugar Organization said this month.
