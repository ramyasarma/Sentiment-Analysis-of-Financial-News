             Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu is ready to agree to a Palestinian state with 
temporary borders as part of an interim settlement agreement, 
Haaretz said, without saying where it got the information.  
 Netanyahu sees such a step as a possible way to break the 
deadlock over peace talks between the sides, Haaretz said. 
Netanyahu is scheduled to meet today with U.S. Middle East 
envoy George Mitchell later today, Haaretz said.
