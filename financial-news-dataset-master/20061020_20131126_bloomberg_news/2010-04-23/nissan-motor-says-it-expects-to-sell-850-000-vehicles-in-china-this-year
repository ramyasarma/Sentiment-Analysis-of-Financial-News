             Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s third-
biggest carmaker, will raise production capacity by almost 70
percent in China even as it expects sales growth to slow.  
 Nissan Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn, speaking today
at the Beijing Auto Show, said the automaker aims to have the
capacity to make to 900,000 vehicles a year in China by 2012 and
plans further increases after that. That exceeds what the
company had said previously and represents a 68 percent increase
over its current annual capacity of 535,000 vehicles.  
 “Nissan is going the right way,” said Takeshi Miyao, an
analyst at auto consulting company Carnorama in Tokyo. “It’s
important for each automaker to gain share now. Later is too
late.”  
 Industrywide auto sales growth in China may slow this year
after surging 46 percent last year to 13.6 million units,
surpassing the U.S. as the world’s largest market. Nissan’s plan
to raise capacity amid slowing growth suggests it may outpace
rivals in China.  
 Nissan is spending 5 billion yuan ($732 million) to expand
its plant in Guangzhou, Guangdong province to build as many as
600,000 vehicles a year by 2012, from 430,000 units currently,
the company said. It builds models including the Tiida compact
and Livina series at the factory.  
 First Quarter Sales  
 The carmaker based in Yokohama, Japan, boosted sales in
China 68 percent to 243,000 units in the first quarter of this
year, Nissan said in a statement. Its China sales rose 39
percent to 756,000 units in 2009. Nissan sales will rise by
about 12 percent, including imports, vehicles this year, the
company said.  
 China’s auto sales growth may be between 10 percent and 15
percent next year as the government may end tax breaks on small
cars, Ghosn said in an interview today in Beijing.  
 Nissan shares closed 0.4 percent lower at 792 yen in Tokyo.  
 The company plans to sell “hundreds” of its Leaf electric
vehicles in China in 2011, Ghosn said in the interview. The Leaf
will be introduced in Japan and the U.S. this year.  
 The Chinese government is expected to announce in July new
incentives for buyers of electric and hybrid cars as it aims to
reduce pollution and improve fuel efficiency in the nation.
Ghosn said today he expects the subsidies in the second half of
this year.  
 Nissan will also introduce its March compact in China in
the second half of this year, the company said. Carmakers there
benefited from a government program last year that cut the sales
tax on cars with engines of 1.6 liters or smaller.  
 Total vehicle demand may rise about 17 percent to 16
million units in 2010, Xu Changming, a research director at
China’s State Information Center, said yesterday. Passenger-car
sales may increase 21.5 percent to 10.5 million, he said.
