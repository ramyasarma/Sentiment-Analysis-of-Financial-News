             The euro will stay “under
pressure” until Greece is granted funding support to quell
concern that the nation may seek to restructure its debt,
Barclays Plc said.  
 “The debt markets are closed to Greece on what would be
viewed as acceptable terms,” London-based currency strategist
Adarsh Sinha wrote in an e-mailed note today. “While a lot of
risk premium has already been factored into the euro, the
possibility of an imminent debt restructuring and associated
contagion effects has not. It is likely to remain under pressure
until there is a ‘circuit-breaker’ in the form of explicit and
substantial financial aid to contain these worries.”
