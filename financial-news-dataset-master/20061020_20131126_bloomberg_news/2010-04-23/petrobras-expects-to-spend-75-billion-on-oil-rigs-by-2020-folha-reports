             Petroleo Brasileiro SA will spend
at least $75 billion to build 25 new rigs for offshore oil
production and storage by 2020, Folha de S. Paulo reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli.  
 Almost half of the new rigs will be used to explore
offshore pre-salt fields in Brazil’s Santos Basin, the newspaper
said.
