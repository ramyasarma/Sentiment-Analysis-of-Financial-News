             Eastern European investor
confidence fell in April on concerns the recovery in western
Europe, which buys most of the region’s exports, is weakening
and a drawn-out Greek deficit crisis will hamper growth.  
 An index of investor and analyst expectations for the
region in the next six months fell 9.3 points to 28 points in
April, according to a survey released today by the ZEW Center
for European Economic Research and Erste Bank AG. The index
reached a record high of 59.1 points in January.  
 The ZEW outlook dropped most for Poland, declining 15
points to 21.1 followed by 3.8 point drop in Romania to 35.4 and
a 3 point decline in Hungary to 40.1, ZEW said. Investor
confidence increased the most in Croatia, by 3.5 points to 31.8.  
 The indicators reflect the difference between the
percentage of analysts who have positive outlooks and those who
have negative outlooks. Ratings run from a maximum 100 points to
a minimum of minus 100 points.
