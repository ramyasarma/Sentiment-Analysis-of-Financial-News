             A rebound in Greek bonds may stall
as investors await details of the financial aid requested from
the European Union and International Monetary Fund, according to
Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.  
 Greek 10-year bonds snapped an eight-day decline today
after the government said it will ask for the 45 billion-euro
($61 billion) rescue package to help manage its deficit.  
 “I’m not sure how long this bounce in Greek bonds can be
sustained unless we get the details about the aid package,”
said Orlando Green, an interest-rate strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB in London. “Spreads can tighten in, albeit
gradually, but it’s all very much about waiting for details.”  
 The spread between Greek 10-year bonds and benchmark German
bunds narrowed 32 basis points to 547 basis points as of 1:24
p.m. in London. It earlier widened to a record 590 basis points.
