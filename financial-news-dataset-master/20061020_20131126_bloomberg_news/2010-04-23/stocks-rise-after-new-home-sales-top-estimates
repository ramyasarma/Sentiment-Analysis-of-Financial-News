             U.S. stocks advanced, extending a
weekly gain, after purchases of new homes surged in March by the
most in almost five decades.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,210.31 at 10:01 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average climbed 31.06 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,165.35.  
 New-home sales climbed 27 percent, the most since April
1963, to an annual pace of 411,000 that exceeded the highest
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, figures from
the Commerce Department showed today in Washington. Last month’s
purchase rate was the highest since July and followed a record-
low of 324,000 in February that was higher than previously
estimated.
