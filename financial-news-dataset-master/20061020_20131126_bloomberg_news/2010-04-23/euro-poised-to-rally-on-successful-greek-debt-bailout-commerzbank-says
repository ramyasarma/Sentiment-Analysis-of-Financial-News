             The euro may be in for a “short”
recovery versus the dollar as the European Union-led bailout
plan for Greece is implemented successfully, according to
Commerzbank AG.  
 The risk of a bailout failure is small because it wouldn’t
benefit either Greece or the other euro-region members and the
International Monetary Fund will be able to provide loans in
case the EU can’t act fast enough, Commerzbank analyst Ulrich
Leuchtmann wrote in a note to clients today.   
 “We continue to assume that the bailout plan can be
implemented successfully,” Leuchtmann in Frankfurt wrote.
“This should lead to a short recovery in the euro against the
dollar.”
