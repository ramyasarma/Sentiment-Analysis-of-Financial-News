             OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , supplier of a quarter of
Europe's gas, and  Ukraine  agreed to avert a threatened supply cut
over an outstanding gas debt, amid a visit by Ukraine's pro-Russia prime minister to Moscow.  
 Gazprom will take ownership of $1.2 billion of gas stored
underground in Ukraine, selling it to consumers in that country
and Europe, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov said today in
remarks broadcast on national television channel NTV, after
meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Viktor Yanukovych.  
 A $929 million debt owed by retailer UkrGazEnergo to
Gazprom's half-owned Ukrainian gas import venture, RosUkrEnergo
AG, will be paid in cash by the end of this month, Zubkov said.  
 Gazprom warned European consumers last week of the possible
supply cuts to Ukraine over what  Russia 's state-run gas-export
monopoly called a $1.3 billion debt. The dispute revived concerns
about President Vladimir Putin using energy as a political tool.
As much as 85 percent of Russian gas is shipped to Europe across
Ukraine.  
 Ukraine accused Russia of engineering a similar gas dispute
in January 2006, during which European supplies were disrupted,
to damage its economy and undermine President Viktor Yushchenko.
Yanukovych won parliamentary elections in March that year.  
 Yanukovych, who met with Putin today at the president's
residence near Moscow, may soon be ousted after the Orange
Revolution alliance, parties led by Yushchenko and ex-Premier
Yulia Timoshenko, gained a majority in early parliamentary
elections on Sept. 30.  
 Underground Storage  
 Gazprom will get 8 billion cubic meters of gas from
Ukraine's underground storage to cancel out the debt, Interfax
said today, citing Yanukovych before he boarded a plane to Kiev.  
 Gazprom Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller, Ukrainian
Energy Minister  Yuriy Boyko  and the heads of the two Ukrainian
gas traders signed an agreement to settle the dispute today, the
Moscow-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  
 UkrGazEnergo pledged to make a $200 million payment on its
debt before Oct. 22, RosUkrEnergo spokesman Andrei Knutov said by
telephone today. The retailer, a venture owned by RosUkrEnergo
and Ukraine's state-owned NAK Naftogaz Ukrayny, already paid down
part of more than $1 billion owed last week. RosUkrEnergo will
cut supplies to Ukraine if payment isn't received, he said.  
 Knutov declined to comment on Zubkov's or Yanukovych's
remarks. Gazprom spokesman  Sergei Kupriyanov  didn't answer his
mobile phone when called by Bloomberg.
