             Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &
Jacobson, the  New York  law firm that represents Merrill Lynch &
Co. and Dow Jones & Co., opened a Shanghai office, its second in
 China , to serve corporate clients expanding in the region.  
 The office, which opened today, will be led by Michael Hickman, a partner in the firm's Hong Kong office who is
relocating. He will be joined by five other Fried Frank lawyers.  
 ``With many of our clients pursuing aggressive growth plans
in the region, matched by the strong growth prospects of Chinese
companies, it was natural for us to open a Shanghai office,''
Fried Frank chairwoman Valerie Ford Jacob said in a statement.  
 The firm opened an office in  Hong Kong , its first in  Asia ,
in December. The 40-lawyer office advised Merrill Lynch
International and Merrill Lynch Far East in connection with Vinda
International Holdings Ltd.'s initial public offering and New
World Department Store China Ltd. in its $300 million IPO, the
firm said.  
 ``Many of our local lawyers have participated in the
explosive growth of cross-border capital raising activities in
China,'' Shanghai office Managing Partner Hickman said in the
statement.  
 Fried Frank is ranked 39th among global law firms based on
the $70.5 billion value of the merger-and-acquisition deals it
handled in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The firm represented Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in  KKR &
Co. (KKR) 's acquisition of First Data Corp. for $27.5 billion and Dow
Jones & Co. in its acquisition by  News Corp. (NWSA)  for $5.5 billion
this year.  
 Fried Frank also was counsel to BellSouth Corp. in its
acquisition by AT&T Inc. for $83.1 billion, the largest deal in
2006, and to Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $43.2 billion
acquisition of TXU Corp by a private equity consortium.
