             News Corp. (NWSA) 's Fox Business Network
named former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Officer  Carly Fiorina  as a contributor to the channel.  
 Fiorina, 53, led Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard from 1999 to 2005. She is the only woman to head a
Fortune 20 company, News Corp. said today in a statement. The
former CEO's role on the cable-TV network hasn't been disclosed.  
 Hewlett-Packard's board ousted Fiorina after the $18.9
billion purchase of Compaq Computer Corp. in 2002 failed to
deliver the profits she promised. Fiorina said she clashed with
the board over its suggestions for day-to-day management of the
company.  
 Fox Business Network, scheduled to start on Oct. 15, will
compete with  General Electric Co. (GE) 's CNBC and  Bloomberg News ,
owned by Bloomberg LP.  
 News Corp. Class A shares rose 16 cents to $23.04 at 4:02
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . They have
gained 7.3 percent this year. Fairfield, Connecticut-based
General Electric gained 49 cents to $42.02.
