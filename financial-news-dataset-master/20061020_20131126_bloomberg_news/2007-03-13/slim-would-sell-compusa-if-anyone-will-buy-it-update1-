             Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim  said
he would sell CompUSA Inc. ``if anyone will buy it.''  
 The Dallas-based retailer, which Slim bought in 2000, said
last month that it plans to shut 126 shops by the end of May,
more than half its stores, as part of a restructuring.  
 ``We got started on the wrong foot,'' Slim said today,
referring to the losses CompUSA has reported since he purchased
the company. ``I would sell it if anyone will buy it,'' he said.  
 Slim, in a press conference in Mexico City, said CompUSA
isn't part of his ``core businesses,'' which include
telecommunications, construction and banking. CompUSA said the
restructuring would include receiving $440 million from  Mexico 
City-based parent U.S. Commercial Corp, a holding company
controlled by Slim. U.S. Commercial Corp. plans a share sale in
Mexico to raise the money to bolster CompUSA.  
 Slim said he erred by not adding two or three executives in
management positions at CompUSA when he purchased the chain. ``We
made a mistake with management,'' he said.  
 CompUSA said Feb. 27 it would focus on top-performing
locations after closing most of its locations. In September, Slim
hired Credit Suisse to explore a possible sale of CompUSA.
