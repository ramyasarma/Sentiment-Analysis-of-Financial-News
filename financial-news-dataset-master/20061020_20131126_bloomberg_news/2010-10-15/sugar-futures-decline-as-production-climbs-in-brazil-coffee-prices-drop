Sugar prices fell the most in two
weeks on signs of rising supply from Brazil, the world’s largest
producer. Cocoa and coffee futures also dropped.  Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South, the largest
producing region, rose 11 percent in the second half of
September to 1.97 million metric tons from a year earlier as
cane yields climbed, industry association Unica said yesterday.
Prices jumped 19 percent in the previous six sessions.  “The market was a little ahead of itself,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in
Chicago.  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.88 cent, or 3.1
percent, to settle at 27.06 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest drop since Sept. 30. The
price gained 2.8 percent this week.  The commodity jumped 46 percent in the third quarter on
concerns that a four-month drought damaged crops in Brazil.
Yesterday, the price reached 28.36 cents, the highest level in
eight months.  Raw sugar probably will rebound, reaching 30 cents by the
end of the year, Ilczyszyn said.  In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery
declined $15.50, or 2.2 percent, to settle at $696.20 a ton on
NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for December delivery dropped $75, or 2.6
percent, to $2,805 a ton in New York. The price, little changed
this week, has dropped 15 percent in 2010.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery fell 52
pounds, or 2.7 percent, to 1,850 pounds ($2,957) a ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery dropped 1.15
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $1.8645 a pound in New York. The
price, up 2.4 percent this week, has climbed 37 percent in 2010.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery were
unchanged at $1,682 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
