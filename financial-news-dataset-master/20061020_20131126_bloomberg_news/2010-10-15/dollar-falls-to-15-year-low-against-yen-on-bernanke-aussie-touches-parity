The dollar rose from an eight-month
low against the euro and traded higher than a 15-year low versus
the yen as technical indicators suggested the plunge in the
greenback in the past six weeks may be hard to sustain.  The U.S. currency slumped earlier versus the euro and yen
and slid to parity with the Australian dollar after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said additional monetary
stimulus may be warranted because inflation is too low and
unemployment is too high.  “He hasn’t really changed the outlook too much for Fed
policy,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in Washington
at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage. “A
lot of this news is already priced in.”  The dollar rose for the first time in four days against the
euro, gaining 0.8 percent to $1.3973 at 4:29 p.m. in New York,
from $1.4084 yesterday. It slid earlier to $1.4159, the weakest
level since Jan. 26. The dollar traded at 81.44 yen, compared
with 81.48, after falling to 80.88, the weakest level since
April 1995, when it reached the post-World War II low of 79.75
yen. The euro fell 0.9 percent to 113.79 yen, from 114.76.  The 14-day relative strength index of the euro against the
dollar fell below 70 for the first time in 14 days. The readings
higher than that level indicated that the euro may be poised for
a drop after rallying more than 9 percent since the end of
August. The relative strength index of the yen versus the dollar
stayed above 70 for a sixth day.  Currency Report Delayed  The U.S. Treasury Department said it will delay a report on
international currencies, including China’s yuan, while citing
progress in the acceleration of the pace of the yuan’s rise.  The yuan advanced 0.4 percent this week and touched 6.6404,
the strongest level since the central bank unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The report will be delayed until after the meetings of the
Group of 20 nations in the coming weeks, according to a
statement from the Treasury.  Australia’s dollar touched $1.0004, trading stronger than
the greenback for the first time since currency controls ended
in 1983 before slipping 0.6 percent to 98.80 U.S. cents. The
pound appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to $1.6107, the highest
level since Jan. 29, before trading at $1.5982.  The  Dollar Index , used by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to
track the greenback against currencies including the euro, yen
and pound, gained 0.4 percent to 76.988 after touching 76.144,
the lowest level since Dec. 11.  Weaker Dollar  The gauge of the greenback has dropped 4.3 percent since
Sept. 21, when the Fed said in a statement following its policy
meeting that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation
if needed” to support the recovery.  Bernanke said today in remarks given at a Boston Fed
conference that the central bank may expand asset purchases or
change the language in its statement, while saying
“nonconventional policies” have costs and limitations. “There
would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case for further
action,” Bernanke said.  “Those words briefly helped to extend the dollar’s
slide,”  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at Wells
Fargo & Co. in New York, wrote in a note to clients. “Those
initial market reactions have since reversed. It is an
indication that further Federal Reserve purchases of U.S.
Treasuries is already widely anticipated.”  Slower Inflation  The consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in September
after 0.3 percent gains in the prior two months, the Labor
Department reported. The median forecast of 79 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.2 percent increase.  The U.S. currency had a fifth weekly decline versus the
euro, matching a period of consecutive losses that ended Dec.
26, 2008, after the central bank cut the fed funds target to
zero to 0.25 percent.  The dollar fell 0.2 percent versus the euro this week and
had a fourth weekly drop against the yen, dipping 0.6 percent.  The greenback has tumbled 5 percent against the yen since
Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged intervening in the market by
selling the currency to prevent its strength from undermining
the nation’s export-dependent economy.  “Everybody is very cautious about a possible Bank of Japan
intervention in the near term,” said  Hidetoshi Yanagihara , a
senior currency trader at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New
York. “The market has been weak-dollar for a long time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
