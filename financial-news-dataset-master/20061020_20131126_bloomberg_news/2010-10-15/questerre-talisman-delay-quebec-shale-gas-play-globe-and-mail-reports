Questerre Energy Corp.  fell the most
in two weeks after the company delayed a plan for two test wells
in Quebec.  Questerre, based in Calgary, dropped 28 cents, or 14.4
percent, to C$1.67 as of 4:11 p.m. in Toronto.  The company and  Talisman Energy Inc.  delayed a plan for two
shale-gas test wells because of the cost of hiring a crew in
Quebec, Anela Dido, a Questerre spokeswoman, said by phone
today.  “It’s more cost-efficient to complete them in the spring
rather than in the fall,” Dido said.  The delay was reported earlier today by the Globe and Mail.
Quebec residents have expressed concerns in public hearings that
shale-gas drilling may affect water supplies, the Globe and Mail
reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
