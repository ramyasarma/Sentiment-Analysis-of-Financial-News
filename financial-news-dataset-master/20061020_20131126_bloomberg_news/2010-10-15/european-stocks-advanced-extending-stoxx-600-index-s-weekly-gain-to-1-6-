European stocks rose, extending a
second week of gains for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, before a
report that may show U.S. retail sales increased for a third
month.  The benchmark Stoxx 600 climbed 0.3 percent to 266.36 at
8:17 a.m in London, extending this week’s gain to 1.6 percent.  U.S. sales grew at 0.4 percent in September, the same pace
as August, according to the median estimate of 80 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Other figures today may show
consumer confidence rose and inflation was little changed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
