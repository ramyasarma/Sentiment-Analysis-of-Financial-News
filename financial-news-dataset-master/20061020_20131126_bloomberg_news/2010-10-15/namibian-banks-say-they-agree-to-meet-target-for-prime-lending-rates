Namibia’s four commercial banks said
they would meet an order issued last year by the Bank of Namibia
to narrow the spread between the central bank’s repo rate and
the commercial banks’ prime lending rate.  The spread will be reduced to 3.75 percentage points from
4.75 points by the end of October, Ian Leyenaar, president of
the Bankers Association of Namibia and chief executive of  FNB
Namibia Holdings Ltd ., said in an e-mailed statement today. The
other three banks are Standard Bank Namibia, Nedbank Namibia and
Bank Windhoek.  The central bank will make its next rate decision on Oct.
20 and the last one for the year on Dec. 15. The repo rate is
currently 7 percent, while commercial banks’ prime interest rate
is about 11.13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
