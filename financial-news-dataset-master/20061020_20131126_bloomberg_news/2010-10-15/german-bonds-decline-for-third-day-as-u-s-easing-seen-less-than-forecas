German bunds fell for a third day on
concern the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce a smaller-than-
expected program of asset purchases in its second round of so-
called quantitative easing.  Bund yields  climbed to equal the highest since Sept. 24 as
European stocks rallied. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields rose the
most in five weeks yesterday after a sale of 30-year bonds
following the close of European markets drew lower-than-average
demand. Bunds pared their decline after a report showed the
euro-region trade deficit widened more than forecast.  “There is some fear that QE announcements from the Fed
will fall short of expectations, and this is a negative for bond
markets globally,” said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “Still, we are at
extremely low levels.”  German 10-year yields climbed four basis points to 2.34
percent at 12:20 p.m. in London. The 2.25 percent securities due
September 2020 fell 0.33, or 3.30 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,410)
face amount, to 99.28. Two-year yields were little changed at
0.8 percent.  U.S. 10-year Treasury yields have fallen as much as 38
basis points, or 0.38 percentage point, from their peak on Sept.
21, the day the Fed signaled further asset purchases may be
likely. Bund yields have dropped 28 basis points in the same
period. The German-U.S. 10-year  yield spread  narrowed to as
little as 12 basis points on Sept. 21, with Treasuries yielding
15 points more than bunds today.  ECB Borrowing  “If you think this round of QE is going to be different to
last time and the Fed will do whatever it takes, then the market
is doing the right thing,” said  Charles Diebel , head of market
strategy at Lloyds Banking Group in London. “I believe they
won’t be as aggressive as the market currently thinks.”  Irish, Portuguese and Spanish 10-year bonds rose relative
to benchmark German bunds, while the Greek-German spread widened
25 basis points to 684 basis points, trimming its weekly
contraction to 68 points. The  Irish-German  spread narrowed three
points to 385 points, while the Portuguese spread tightened five
points to 371.  Yields on bonds from so-called peripheral euro-region
nations fell this week after Spanish, Greek and Portuguese banks
reduced their reliance on European Central Bank funding in
September as concern over the sovereign debt crisis eased.  Spanish banks’ ECB borrowings fell 11 percent from August
to 97.7 billion euros ($137.7 billion), the Bank of Spain said
today on its website. Greek lenders took less from the ECB for a
second month, using a total of 94.3 billion euros for
refinancing operations, the Bank of Greece said, while
Portugal’s central bank said on Oct. 11 that its banks’ ECB
financing fell 19 percent.  Weber Wants Exit  Across the 16-nation euro area, banks tapped the ECB for
447.7 billion euros, up from 428.5 billion euros in August.
Irish bank borrowings from the ECB rose 25 percent last month to
119.1 billion euros, the nation’s central bank said earlier this
month.  German 10-year yields are six basis points higher this week
after European Central Bank Council member  Axel Weber  said the
ECB should stop its bond-buying program and prepare to withdraw
other emergency measures. Bund yields have stayed within a range
of 2.36 percent and 2.2 percent since Sept. 24.  Germany’s bonds have returned 1.9 percent since June 30,
compared with 2.6 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 3.7 percent
for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Greek bonds handed investors 12 percent returns during the
period, while Irish securities lost 1.4 percent and Portuguese
debt 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
