Colombia, the second-largest
producer of Arabica coffee, said a fungus that damages plants
may reduce coffee production next year, a day after the nation’s
coffee federation cut its forecast for this year’s harvest.  Output this year will be 9.5 million bags, Agriculture
Minister  Juan Restrepo  told reporters today in Bogota, in line
with yesterday’s estimate of this year’s crop from Colombia’s
National Federation of Coffee Growers.  Coffee rallied about 30 percent in the past 12 months after
Colombia’s harvest last year fell to 7.8 million bags, the
smallest since 1976, curbing global supplies.  In November, monthly production may surge in Colombia to
2.5 million bags because growing conditions have improved,
Finance Minister  Juan Carlos Echeverry , who is a member of the
Federation, told reporters yesterday in Bogota.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery dropped 1.2
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $1.864 a pound as of 2:03 p.m. in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
