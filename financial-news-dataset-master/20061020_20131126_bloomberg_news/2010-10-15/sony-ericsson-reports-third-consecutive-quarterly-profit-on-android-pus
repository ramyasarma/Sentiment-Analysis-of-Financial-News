Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications
AB, the mobile-phone venture of  Sony Corp.  and  Ericsson AB ,
posted its third consecutive profitable quarter, aided by demand
for smartphones running Google Inc.’s Android software.  Third-quarter net income was 49 million euros ($68.8
million) compared with a loss of 164 million euros a year
earlier, the London-based company said. That fell short of the
59 million euros analysts had predicted, according to the median
of 13 estimates collected by Bloomberg.  “Sony Ericsson’s overall performance is stabilizing,”
Chief Executive Officer  Bert Nordberg  said today in a  statement .
“Smartphones now comprise more than 50 percent of our total
sales and it is our ambition to become the global number one
handset provider on the Android platform.”  Sony Ericsson turned profitable in the first quarter after
six quarters of losses as it rolled out its Android phones in
the U.S. and China. That boosted the average price for Sony
Ericsson handsets to 154 euros in the third quarter from 114
euros a year earlier as more consumers embraced Android as an
alternative to  Apple Inc. ’s iPhone.  Prices declined from last quarter’s high of 160 euros as
the company added mid-priced phones to its lineup.  Sales were little changed at 1.6 billion euros, missing
estimates. Revenue had been predicted at 1.82 billion euros,
based on 16 analysts’ estimates.  Sony Ericsson cited “product and geographical mix” as the
reason for lower sequential selling prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
