Holcim Ltd., the world’s second-
biggest cement maker, is avoiding a dip in Morocco’s cement
market this year and is set to benefit as infrastructure
projects fuel a recovery in 2011.  Morocco’s cement market will shrink by 1 percent this year
as the effects of a tourism boom and low-income housing projects
peter out, said  Cedric Nater , finance head at Holcim Maroc SA.  “The government projects will have an effect on the cement
market in 2011 and 2012,” Nater said yesterday in a phone
interview.  A new metro system in Casablanca, a port development in
Nador, and a new train line linking Tangier to Marrakesh will be
a boost to the local cement market, the executive said. Holcim
in 2008 raised 1.5 billion dirhams ($186 million) in a bond sale
to double capacity at its Fez plant, 100 miles northeast of the
capital Rabat. Production will increase to 1.2 million metric
tons by 2012, Nater said.  Holcim has three cement factories in the country: in Oujda,
Settat and Fez. Profit at the unit rose 19 percent in the first
half to 491 million dirhams. Revenue increased 5 percent to 1.9
billion dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
