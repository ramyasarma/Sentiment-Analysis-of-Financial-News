Reynolds American Inc.  said Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer  Susan Ivey  will retire in February
and be succeeded as CEO by Daniel Delen, chief of the cigarette
division.  Thomas Wajnert, a Reynolds director, will replace Ivey as
board chairman Nov. 1, the Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based
company said today in a statement. Reynolds said it split the
roles of chairman and CEO after evaluating its corporate
governance.  Ivey, 51, stepped up the marketing of Camel and Pall Mall
cigarettes after taking charge of the second-largest U.S.
tobacco producer in 2004. As Reynolds’ share of cigarette sales
slipped, she engineered the acquisition of snuff maker Conwood
Co. in 2006, beating larger  Altria Group Inc.  into the smokeless
tobacco segment.  Reynolds also announced a 2-for-1 stock split for
shareholders as of Nov. 1. In addition, the company increased
its quarterly dividend to 49 cents a share from 45 cents,
adjusted for the split. The revised payout will be made Jan. 3
to shareholders as of Dec. 10.  Ivey told fellow directors of her Feb. 28 retirement plans
in a two-sentence letter dated Oct. 11, according to a
securities  filing  today. She wrote she was resigning as chairman
Oct. 31 and as CEO Feb. 28 to “ensure an orderly transition.”  Reynolds climbed $1.80, or 3 percent, to $61.77 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
 shares ’ highest close since March 18, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
