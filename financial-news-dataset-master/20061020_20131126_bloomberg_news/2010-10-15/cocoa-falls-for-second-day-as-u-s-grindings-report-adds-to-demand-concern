Cocoa fell in New York and London
after a U.S. grindings report added to signs that demand
may be slowing.  Cocoa grindings, an indication of demand, in the U.S.,
Mexico and Canada climbed 1.7 percent in the third quarter, down
from a 12 percent jump in the second quarter, the National
Confectioners Association said yesterday. European processing
dropped 4 percent in the third quarter. July cocoa futures in
London expired at a record high in mid July as traders took
delivery of the most beans since 1996.  “If you’re looking at reasons why grindings disappointed I
think you can really track it to the strength of the July
position,” said  Jonathan Parkman , joint-head of the agriculture
division at Marex Financial Ltd. in London. “Whenever you get a
large variation in the structure, it has a direct impact on
production of cocoa products.”  Cocoa for December delivery dropped $16, or 0.6 percent, to
$2,864 a metric ton by 9 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
In London, the December futures fell 5 pounds, or 0.3 percent,
to 1,897 pounds ($3,050) a ton on NYSE
Liffe. Prices in London fell 0.6 percent yesterday after the
European Cocoa Association’s report on European grind.  White, or refined,  sugar  for December delivery declined
$7.40, or 1 percent, to $704.30 a ton on NYSE Liffe and raw
sugar for March delivery dropped 0.2 cent, or 0.7 percent, to
27.74 cents a pound on ICE.  Robusta coffee for January delivery added 0.4 percent to
$1,688 a ton on Liffe and arabica coffee for December delivery
dropped 0.1 percent to $1.8735 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
