HSBC Holdings Plc  cut its wind power
forecast for the U.S., and said Vestas Wind Systems A/S is the
best-placed turbine manufacturer worldwide to gain market share
in the slump.  The London-based bank cut its U.S. forecast 14 percent to 6
gigawatts this year and by 33 percent to 5 gigawatts next year.
It cited competition from cheap shale gas, uncertainty about
federal clean energy legislation and a weak market for power
purchase agreements, analyst  James Magness  said in an e-mailed
note today.  A record amount of new orders leaves Vestas as the best-
positioned wind-turbine manufacturer to gain market share,
Magness wrote. Sales for the Randers, Denmark-based company will
grow by about 25 percent next year, while the overall market
grows 10 percent, he forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
