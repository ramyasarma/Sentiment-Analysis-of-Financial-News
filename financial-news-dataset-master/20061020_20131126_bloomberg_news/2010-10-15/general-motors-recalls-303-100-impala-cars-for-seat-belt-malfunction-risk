General Motors Co. is recalling
303,100 Impala cars in the U.S. because seat belts in the front
seat may not be properly anchored and may not restrain
passengers in a crash.  The company will reinstall seat-belt anchors in the Impala
for model years 2009 and 2010 that have the defect, according to
a letter on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
website today.  “If it occurs, the belt can separate in a crash, so it’s
obviously something we need to get taken care of,” Alan Adler,
a GM spokesman, said in an interview. “It separates at the
anchor to the lower part of the seat.”  No injuries are associated with the defect, which GM, based
in Detroit, discovered through warranty reports, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
