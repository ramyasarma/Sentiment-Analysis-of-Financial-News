Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecasts
“substantially higher prices” for oil in the second half of
2011 and 2012 as the global inventory surplus is exhausted.  “We believe that forward price levels offer good hedging
opportunities for calendar 2011/2012 for consumers despite the
recent rally,” Goldman  analysts  led by Allison Nathan and
Jeffrey Currie said in a note to clients yesterday.   “We expect the supply-demand balance to continue to
tighten in the fourth quarter of 2010 as continued global
economic growth, albeit likely at a slower pace than in the
first half, continues to strengthen demand,” the note said.
“Moving into the second half of 2011 and 2012, we expect the
global inventory surplus to be exhausted and OPEC spare capacity
to be drawn on to balance the market, leading to
substantinally higher prices.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
