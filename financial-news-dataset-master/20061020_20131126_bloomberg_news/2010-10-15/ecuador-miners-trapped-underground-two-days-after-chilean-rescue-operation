Four miners are trapped underground
in a mine in southern Ecuador after a cave-in early this
morning, the South American country’s government said.  Rescue workers are trying to make contact with the miners,
trapped 150 meters (492 feet) below ground, the National Risk
Management Secretary said today in a  statement  on its website.  The miners may be rescued tonight, Quito-based newspaper El
Comercio said today on its website, citing Jorge Espinosa,
undersecretary of mine development at the nation’s Non-Renewable
Natural Resources Ministry. The collapse comes two days after
the rescue of 33 Chilean miners, trapped below ground for as
long as 70 days in what became the world’s longest mine rescue.  The mine, which produces gold, silver and copper, is
located in the city of  Portovelo  and is owned by Machala,
Ecuador-based  Minesadco SA , Carlos Perez, an engineer’s
assistant at the company, said today in a telephone interview.  The mine in Ecuador collapsed after a water leak weakened
the structure where the miners were located, El Comercio said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
