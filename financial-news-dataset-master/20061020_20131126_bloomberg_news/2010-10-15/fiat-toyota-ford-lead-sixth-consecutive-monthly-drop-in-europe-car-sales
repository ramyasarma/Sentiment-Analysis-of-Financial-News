Fiat Spa , Toyota Motor Corp. and
Ford Motor Co. led a sixth straight monthly drop in European car
sales as demand wanes after government trade-in incentives end.  Registrations in the region fell 9.2 percent to 1.26
million vehicles in September from 1.39 million a year earlier,
the Brussels-based  European Automobile Manufacturers’
Association  said in an e-mailed statement today. Nine-month
sales dropped 3.7 percent to 10.6 million.  Deliveries at Fiat, based in Turin, Italy, declined 21
percent to 86,773. Toyota’s registrations tumbled 21 percent to
57,573, while Ford dropped 20 percent to 108,700 units.  European demand is declining as governments end or trim
subsidies in place last year to aid the auto industry during the
economic crisis. The region’s five biggest markets of Germany,
Italy, France, Spain and the U.K. all declined last month, with
sales in Spain slumping 27 percent, the steepest drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
