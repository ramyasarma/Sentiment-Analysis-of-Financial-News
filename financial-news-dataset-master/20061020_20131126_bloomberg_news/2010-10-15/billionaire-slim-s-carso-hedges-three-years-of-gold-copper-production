Grupo Carso SAB , the holding company
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , said its mining unit
hedged the price for part of its future output of gold, copper
and other metals for the next three years.  Forty-three percent of gold output was hedged over three
years for $1,189 an ounce, Carso said today in a statement to
the Mexican stock exchange. The Mexico City-based company also
agreed to the short-term hedging contracts for 26 percent of its
silver output at $18.71 an ounce, 61 percent of its copper
production at $3.32 a pound, 39 percent of zinc at $1.08 a
pound, and 28 percent of lead at $1.04 a pound.  The mining unit, Grupo Frisco, opted to lock in prices for
some of its production to guarantee profitability amid “strong
speculation and volatility in the mineral markets,” Grupo Carso
said in the statement. Mining producers sometimes sell future
output at fixed prices to secure loans or investments.  Carso’s mining unit generated 6.8 percent of the company’s
66 billion pesos ($5.3 billion) of  sales  last year.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,372 at 1:59 p.m. on the Comex in New York, and
silver futures for December delivery slipped 0.6 percent to
$24.288 an ounce. Gold has gained 25 percent this year, while
silver has jumped 44 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
