The won retreated from a five-month
high after an increase in U.S. jobless claims highlighted the
fragility of a recovery in the world’s biggest economy, damping
speculation South Korea will raise interest rates. Bonds gained.  The currency is headed for a seventh weekly advance, its
longest winning streak in a year, as  overseas investors  pumped
more than $6 billion into Korean equities since the start of
September. The Bank of Korea yesterday kept its benchmark seven-
day repurchase rate at 2.25 percent for a third month, saying
won appreciation and risks to growth from slowdowns in the U.S.
and Europe deterred policy makers from raising borrowing costs.  “There exist some expectations that BoK will remain at
2.25 percent” given the uncertain global recovery, said  Yoo Jae Ho , a currency strategist at Kiwoom Securities Co. in Seoul.
“The market thinks that BoK would rather maintain its policy
rate to stabilize the exchange rate for now.”  The won slid 0.5 percent to 1,116.55 per dollar as of 10:50
a.m. in Seoul, trimming this week’s advance to 0.3 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It yesterday reached
1,110.05, the strongest level since May 4, and has appreciated
7.4 percent since the start of September.  The Bank of Korea kept its policy rate unchanged for a
third month as the rally in the currency threatens export growth.
Overseas shipments grew 17.2 percent in September, the slowest
pace in 11 months, the government said on Oct. 1.  The number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits
unexpectedly climbed by 13,000 to 462,000 last week, the Labor
Department said yesterday. The U.S. trade deficit widened 8.8
percent to $46.3 billion in August from $42.6 billion the prior
month, Commerce Department figures showed.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.75 percent debt due June 2013
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.09 percent,
the lowest level since the notes were issued in June, according
to Korea Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
