Canadian existing home sales rose 3
percent in September from the previous month, according to a
statement from the Canadian Real Estate Association.  Seasonally adjusted unit sales rose to 33,913 homes from
32,933 units in August, the group said. Sales in September were
20 percent below year-ago levels and the average price for a
home was little changed at C$331,089 ($329,180), the group said.  Canada’s mortgage rates are close to the  lowest  since the
Korean War even after the Bank of Canada raised its overnight
lending rate three times since June to 1 percent from a record
0.25 percent. The central bank said in July it expects housing
to contribute 0.6 percentage point to Canada’s 3.5 percent
growth this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
