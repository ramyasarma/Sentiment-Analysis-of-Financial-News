Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi will face investigation by Rome prosecutors into
allegations of tax fraud as part of on ongoing probe by a Milan
court, one of his lawyers said today.  “It’s still part of the same enquiry-- the one in Milan.
As the company buying the rights was based in Rome, it’s up to
the Roman prosecutors to deal with that,” said Berlusconi
lawyer Pietro Longo in an interview. “There is no new
development whatsoever.”  Berlusconi, 74, and a dozen others face charges in Milan of
using offshore accounts to pay premiums for movie rights bought
by the premier’s Mediaset SpA television network from Hollywood
production companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
