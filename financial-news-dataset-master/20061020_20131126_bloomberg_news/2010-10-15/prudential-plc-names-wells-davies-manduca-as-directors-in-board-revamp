Prudential Plc , the U.K.’s biggest
insurer, promoted  Mike Wells  to chief executive officer of its
U.S. division and appointed two new non-executive directors as
it reorganizes the board after a failed takeover bid in Asia.  Wells, 50, has been chief operating officer of Jackson
National Life Insurance Co. for the last nine years and will
replace  Clark Manning , who will leave the company at the end of
the year, London-based Prudential said today in a statement.  Paul Manduca , 58, will replace James Ross as the company’s
senior independent director and  Howard Davies , a 59-year-old
director of the London School of Economics, also joins as a non-
executive. Manduca is currently a senior independent director at
WM Morrison Supermarkets Plc.  Prudential is reorganizing its board after its failure to
buy American International Group Inc.’s Asian division for $35.5
billion sparked an investor rebellion and cost the company 284
million pounds ($457 million) in fees earlier this year. Some of
Prudential’s biggest investors called for CEO Tidjane Thiam to
resign following the collapse of the deal.  Prudential dropped 6 pence, or 1 percent, to 613 pence
at 1:22 p.m. in London trading, valuing the firm at about
15.6 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
