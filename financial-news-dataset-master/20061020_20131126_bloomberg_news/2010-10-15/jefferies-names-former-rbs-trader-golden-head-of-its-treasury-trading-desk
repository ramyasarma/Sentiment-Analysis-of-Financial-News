Jefferies & Co., one of the 18
 primary dealers  that trade U.S. government debt with the Federal
Reserve, hired former Royal Bank of Scotland Plc trader  James Golden  as head of its Treasury trading desk.  Golden, 50, joined the firm this week in the newly created
position, according to  Chris Bury , co-head of fixed-income rates
at New York-based Jefferies. He had joined Royal Bank’s RBS
Securities unit in May 2008 after leaving Merrill Lynch & Co.
Golden, who worked as a trader at RBS Securities until August,
has been trading bonds since 1988.  RBS Securities said last month that  Rishi Shah , who had
been co-head of interest rates with  Richard Volpe , and  James Galluzzo , who traded short-term Treasuries, left the firm.  RBS Securities hired  Stephen Callahan , formerly head of
Treasury trading at Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc, as a senior
trader, reporting to Volpe, said  Michael Geller , a spokesman for
the firm.  The decision to hire Callahan, who started at RBS
Securities in August, was unrelated to any other personnel
changes, Geller said.  Treasuries of all maturities have returned 8.8 percent this
year through Oct. 14, compared with a 3.7 percent decline last
year, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
Treasury Master index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
