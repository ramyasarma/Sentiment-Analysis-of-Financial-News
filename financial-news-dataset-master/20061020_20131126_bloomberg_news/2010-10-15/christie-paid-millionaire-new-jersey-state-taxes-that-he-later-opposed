New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie 
and his wife, Mary Pat, a Cantor Fitzgerald LP vice president,
paid $33,619 in state taxes on almost $600,000 in 2009 income,
according to copies of their returns.  The governor, who has campaigned to rein in New Jersey’s
highest-in-the-nation  property taxes , reported paying $36,866 in
real-estate levies last year. The couple also paid $147,118 in
federal income tax, the returns released today show.  The couple’s New Jersey income was enough to make them
subject to the state’s so-called millionaire tax, which applied
to 2009 earnings of more than $400,000. Christie, 48, opposed
the tax after becoming governor in January. The Republican
vetoed a bill the Democrat-controlled Legislature passed that
would have extended for this year the portion of the surcharge
that applied to incomes above $1 million.  Christie and his wife reported $596,985 in total income
including  Mary Pat Christie ’s $517,240 pay at Cantor Fitzgerald
and $17,662 in royalties from McNeil PPC Inc.  The governor and his wife made a total of $20,481 in
charitable contributions, according to their federal return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
