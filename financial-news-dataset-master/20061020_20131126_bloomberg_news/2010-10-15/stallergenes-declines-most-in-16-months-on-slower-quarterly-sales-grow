Stallergenes , the French maker of
allergy medicines, fell the most in four months in Paris trading
after reporting slowing sales growth because of a “relatively
weak” pollen season.  Third-quarter sales rose 10 percent to 42 million euros
($59 million), compared with 13 percent growth in the first
half, the Antony, France-based company said in a statement late
yesterday. The company also cited a 10 percent regulatory rebate
in Germany that was applied in the last two months of the
quarter.  “The level of activity in early 2011 could be hurt by the
weakness of the 2010 allergy season,”  Patrick Jousseaume , an
analyst at Societe Generale in Paris, wrote in a report today.
He cut his  recommendation  on the stock to “hold” from “buy.”  French authorities proposed a 15 percent reimbursement rate
for Stallergenes’ Oralair hay-fever treatment, the company said.
Stallergenes will present new data next year to seek a higher
reimbursement, and as a result won’t sell the drug while the
process is under way, it said.  Stallergenes  shares  fell 2.60 euros, or 4 percent, to 63.15
euros as of 5:35 p.m., giving the company a market value of
836.9 million euros. It was the stock’s biggest decline since
June 7.  The stock has returned 8.4 percent this year including
dividends,  compared with  an 8.6 percent increase in the
Bloomberg European Pharmaceutical Index.  Stallergenes reiterated sales will rise more than 10
percent this year with a “significant” increase in earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
