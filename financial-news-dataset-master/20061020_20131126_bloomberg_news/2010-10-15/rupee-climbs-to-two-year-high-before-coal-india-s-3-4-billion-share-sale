India’s rupee completed a seventh
weekly gain, the longest winning streak since April 2009, on
speculation a planned sale of shares in  Coal India Ltd.  will
attract overseas funds.  The currency touched the strongest level in more than two
years as the state-owned company plans to raise as much as 151.3
billion rupees ($3.4 billion) in the nation’s biggest-ever
initial public offering that opens next week. The  Reserve Bank
of India  may intervene to curb gains in Asia’s best-performing
currency in the past month to shield exporters, Deputy Governor
Subir Gokarn said yesterday. The currency rose for a third day
before the government unveils inflation data for September.  “The rupee is appreciating due to the Coal India IPO,”
said  Ashutosh Raina , head of foreign-exchange trading at HDFC
Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “We have to see whether the RBI
intervenes, with inflation at current levels.”  The rupee appreciated 0.8 percent to 44.10 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency climbed to as much as 43.9650, its
strongest level since August 2008. The rupee has surged 5.1
percent in the past month.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.74 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 44.78
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  Fund-Raising Plan  India will sell shares in  Steel Authority of India Ltd. ,
 Indian Oil Corp.  and  Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  in the year ending
March 31 as part of its fund-raising plan. The government said
in January it can sell equities in as many as 68 companies as it
seeks to shrink the budget deficit to 5.5 percent from an
estimated 6.9 percent of gross domestic product.  The South Asian nation’s companies have raised a record 806
billion rupees in equity and rights sales this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark  Sensitive Index  has
gained 15 percent so far in 2010. The index slid 1.8 percent
today, the most since June 7.  Funds based abroad have pumped $22.5 billion into India’s
stocks and $10.2 billion into its bonds so far in 2010,
according to exchange data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
