Soybeans rose to a 16-month high in
Chicago before a U.S. government report that analysts said may
show demand for the country’s crops remains strong. Corn and
wheat gained.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture will say soybean export
sales are expected to be between 700,000 and 1.2 million metric
tons in the week ended Oct. 7, up from 654,548 tons a year
earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey. Corn and wheat
shipments are also estimated to have increased.  “Demand remains strong, especially from China, supporting
gains,” said  Ker Chung Yang,  an analyst at Phillip Futures Ltd.
“If the export data is better than estimated, it is likely to
push soybean prices higher.”  Soybeans for January delivery gained 0.9 percent to
$12.1025 a bushel at 12:52 p.m. Paris time on the Chicago Board
of Trade after touching $12.145, the highest price since June 5
last year. The oilseed is up 5.7 percent this week, set for a
second straight gain.  “Soybeans in the U.S. breached the barrier of $12 a bushel
in a context where Chinese demand isn’t weakening and there
continue to be concerns about the future Brazilian harvest,”
Paris-based farm adviser Agritel said in a report.  The USDA will report export data for crops today at 8:30
a.m. in Washington.  Soybean Consumption  U.S. producers of animal feed and vegetable oils in
September increased soybean use by 16 percent from a year
earlier to 124.9 million bushels, according to the National
Oilseed Processors Association. Exporters sold 280,000 tons of
soybeans to China for delivery in the year that began Sept. 1,
the USDA said Oct. 15.  Soybeans are poised to extend the biggest quarterly rally
in two years as investors have increased bets on the oilseed
amid indications that farmers may use more land for corn, which
is currently a more profitable crop,  Tetsu Emori , commodity fund
manager at Astmax Ltd., said by phone.  At today’s prices, a bushel of soybeans costs the same as
about 2.1 bushels of corn. That’s less than the 10-year weekly
average of 2.46 bushels of corn, according to Bloomberg data.  Corn for December delivery rose 0.8 percent to $5.7175 a
bushel, headed for an 8.2 percent gain this week.  Corn’s 71 percent jump from this year’s low, spurred by
rising demand from feed mills and ethanol producers, may prompt
soybean farmers in exporting countries to abandon the oilseed
and switch to corn, Emori said.  “We always have this battle for acres,”  Wayne Gordon , an
analyst at Rabobank Groep NV, said by phone from Sydney. “A lot
will depend on the differentials,” he said, referring to the
gap between soybean and corn prices.  Wheat for December delivery advanced 0.5 percent to $7.0425
a bushel, set for a 2.1 percent weekly drop. November-delivery
milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris advanced 0.1 percent
to 213.75 euros ($300.98) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
