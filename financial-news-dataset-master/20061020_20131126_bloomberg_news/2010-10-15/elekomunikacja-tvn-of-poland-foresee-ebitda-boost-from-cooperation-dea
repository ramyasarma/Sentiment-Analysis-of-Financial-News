Telekomunikacja Polska SA , Poland’s
biggest phone company, and television network  TVN SA  expect a
cooperation agreement signed yesterday to boost their earnings
by cutting investment costs and giving access to more clients.  The accord will have a positive 100 million-zloty ($36
million) impact on each company’s earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization during the next five years,
Telekomunikacja and TVN said in separate statements.  Telekomunikacja will provide Internet access and other
services to clients of TVN’s N digital platform, and TVN will
offer N to the phone company’s broadband customers. One of the
benefits is that TVN will gain access to Telekomunikacja’s
network of shops,  Markus Tellenbach , chief executive officer of
the broadcaster, told a news conference in Warsaw.  “Our stores are not in premium locations,” he said. “We
sell N, occasionally, between washing machines and hair dryers”
through appliance-store chains. The agreement will give N “a
more prominent, a more visible, and with that a more effective”
way to reach customers, he said.  TVN rose 2.1 percent to 18.78 at 11:52 a.m. in Warsaw, its
highest level in two months. Telekomunikacja slipped 0.6 percent
and the benchmark WIG20 Index lost 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
