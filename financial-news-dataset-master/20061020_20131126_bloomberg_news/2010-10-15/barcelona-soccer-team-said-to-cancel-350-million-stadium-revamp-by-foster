Barcelona, the second-biggest soccer
club by sales, will cancel a 250 million-euro ($350 million)
stadium redesign by British architect  Norman Foster  as part of a
plan to reduce spending, two people with knowledge of the
situation said.  The club isn’t liable to pay any compensation, the people
said. In 2007, Foster was named to redesign the 98,000-seat Camp
Nou arena with a multicolored exterior influenced by Spanish
architect Antoni Gaudi. The two people declined to be named
because the decision hasn’t been made public.  Barcelona team president  Sandro Rosell  said before he
joined the club July 1 that he wasn’t in favor of the redesign
approved by his predecessor  Joan Laporta  and had intended to
make the bowl-shaped arena more emblematic. The club may work
with Foster on other projects.  The stadium also would have added 10,000 seats, making it
the world’s second-biggest soccer ground after the Azteca
Stadium in Mexico City.  Carlos Sole , an associate partner at Foster’s office in
Madrid, said by telephone it hasn’t been officially informed of
the decision to cancel the plans. Last year, the project was
shelved for 18 months.  Foster helped redesign Wembley Stadium, which has a 133-
meter (436-feet) high steel arch visible across much of London.  Barcelona trails only Real Madrid in sales among soccer
clubs, according to Deloitte LLP. Barcelona is cutting costs
after Rosell’s board revised a 9 million-euro profit in the year
to June 30 to a 77 million-euro loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
