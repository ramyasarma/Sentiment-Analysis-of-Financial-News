Chile’s copper  export revenue  in
September rose to the highest level since March 2008 on rising
production and surging prices of the metal.  Revenue rose to $3.92 billion in September, a 47 percent
gain over the $2.66 billion a year ago, the central bank said on
its website. Copper export revenue in Chile, the world’s largest
producer of the metal, was $4.26 billion in March 2008.  Copper prices rose to a 27-month high earlier this week as
commodities headed for an eighth straight weekly increase, the
longest streak since 1996, as a weaker dollar boosts the appeal
of metals, grains and energy as alternative investments.  State-owned Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer,
boosted output last year as its Norte division and Melbourne-
based BHP Billiton Ltd. raised production at Escondida, the
world’s largest copper mine in Chile’s Atacama Desert.  To contact the reporters on this story:
