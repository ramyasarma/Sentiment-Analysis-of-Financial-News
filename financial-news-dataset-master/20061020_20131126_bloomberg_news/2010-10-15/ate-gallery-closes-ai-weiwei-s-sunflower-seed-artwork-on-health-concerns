Tate  Modern banned visitors from
walking through an artwork of more than 100 million porcelain
sunflower seeds because it might be hazardous to health.  “We have been advised that the interaction of visitors
with the sculpture can cause dust which could be damaging to
health following repeated inhalation over a long period of
time,” the gallery said today  in a statement  on its website.
“Tate, in consultation with the artist, has decided not to
allow members of the public to walk across the sculpture.”  “Sunflower Seeds” by the Chinese artist  Ai Weiwei , 53,
opened on Oct. 12. It is the latest temporary installation in
the vast industrial space of the Turbine Hall of the gallery, on
the south bank of the River Thames in London.  Each seed has been individually sculpted and painted in
workshops in the Chinese city of Jingdezhen. The sculpture may
now only be viewed from the Turbine Hall bridge.  To contact the writer on this story:
