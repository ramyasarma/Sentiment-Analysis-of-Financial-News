Gasoil prices in Singapore were at
their smallest discount to European levels in a week, making it
less profitable to ship diesel cargoes to Europe because of
increased demand in Asia.  The  East-West  gasoil spread for November narrowed to a
discount of $13.75 a barrel at 10:07 a.m. Singapore time from as
much as $23.75 on Sept. 30, according to data from broker PVM
Oil Associates. The spread is the smallest since Oct. 8.  The Asian  gasoil crack , a measure of processing profits,
was at $13.57 a barrel from $12.80 on Oct. 8 as demand improved,
PVM data showed. Vietnam National Petroleum Corp., known as
Petrolimex, will buy 140,000 cubic meters of gasoline and diesel
from Dung Quat Oil Refinery this month, the Tuoi Tre newspaper
reported on Oct. 13.  Gasoil  swaps have risen 3.1 percent so far
this week to $95.90 a barrel.  Fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai crude widened to $7.83 a
barrel from $6.48 a barrel on Oct. 8 even as stockpiles in
Singapore fell for a second week. That’s the biggest spread in
five months.  Swaps for fuel oil  rose 1 percent to $484.25 a
metric ton.  Singapore’s onshore inventories of residues, a category
that includes fuel oil, low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes
bitumen, dropped 2.9 percent to 21.3 million barrels in the
seven days ended Oct. 13 from a week earlier, a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry said yesterday. Supplies are at
their lowest level since Sept. 29.  Open-specification naphtha cargoes delivered in the second
half of November were bid at $768 a ton against offers at $771,
data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte showed. First-half
December lots were bid at $767 a ton to offers at $770 a ton.  Prices of  naphtha  for delivery in December were at $775.50
a ton yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
