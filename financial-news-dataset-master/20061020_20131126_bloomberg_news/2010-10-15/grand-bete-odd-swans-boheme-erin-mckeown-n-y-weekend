The Broadway revival of  “La Bete” 
features the U.K.’s great clown  Mark Rylance  in a scenery-
devouring, tour-de-force performance as a buffoonish actor
foisted on  David Hyde Pierce  and his tony acting troupe.  Composed in rhyming couplets and set in Moliere’s 17th-
century France, David Hirson’s breakneck farce is even timelier
in the era of  Glenn Beck  and the Tea Party crowd than it was in
1991. “It’s dangerous to be governed by a fool,” Hyde Pierce’s
beleaguered scribe rails, “but worse when fools bemoan the sad
decline/Of standards which their efforts undermine!”  Four stars (****) for this unmissable jewel.  At the Music Box Theatre, 239 W. 45th St. Information: +1-
212-239-6200;  http://www.telecharge.com   Afterward, go to the  Cafe Carlyle , where the highest
standards of the American songbook are being upheld by crooner
and guitarist  John Pizzarelli  and his swinging, singing wife,
 Jessica Molaskey , in a sensational, sophisticated show called
“The Heart of a Saturday Night.”  At the Carlyle Hotel, Madison Avenue at 76th Street; +1-
212-744-1600.  Saturday Afternoon  You thought (if at all) that “Swan Lake” was about
Tchaikovsky’s music and the travails of ballerinas. It’s about
men in feathers!  That’s what you get in Matthew Bourne’s notorious travesty
(and I mean that in the nicest possible way) of the ballet, with
its grand sets by Lez Brotherston and that dangerous-looking
corps of befeathered, flexible hunks replacing damsels in tutus.  At  City Center , 131 W. 55th St. Information: +1-212-581-
1212;  http://www.nycitycenter.org   When it’s over, head around the corner to the Russian
Samovar for an icy horseradish vodka.  256 W. 52nd St.; +1-212-757-0168.  Saturday Night  The most beautiful sets at the  Metropolitan Opera  return to
view as the curtain rises on “La Boheme” in the production by
 Franco Zeffirelli . You have to be a stone not to weep during the
third act when Mimi and Rodolfo say goodbye as snow falls in
mute sorrow. The spotlight is on Italian divo, Vittorio Grigolo,
who has just released an album of tenor arias, and makes his Met
debut as the high-singing poet.  At Lincoln Center, Broadway at W. 66th St. Information:
+212-362-2000;  http://www.metopera.org   Get a late drink at Lincoln Center’s newest addition, the
Italian-based Lincoln, right there on the plaza.  Lincoln, +1-212-359-6500.  Sunday Afternoon  Forget the movie. You really have no excuse to pass up an
opportunity to see two of the era’s consummate actors,  Vanessa Redgrave  and  James Earl Jones , in “Driving Miss Daisy.”
They’re appearing in Alfred Uhry’s deftly-spun, nostalgic tale
of a Southern Jewish doyenne (and what kind of a Jewish name is
Daisy, anyway?) and her unshakeable black driver.  At the Golden Theatre, 252 W. 45th St. Information: +1-212-
239-6200; ttp://www.telecharge.com  Stay in the mood with Southern fried chicken and garlic
mashed potatoes at Delta Grill, 700 Ninth Ave; +1-212-956-0934.  Sunday Night  Exuberant singer-songwriter Erin McKeown writes intimate
folk-rock numbers and then pounds them out on her electric
guitar, and she just rocks. Tonight she brings her tour
celebrating the decade since the release of her outstanding
“Distillation” to the  Highline Ballroom .  At 431 W. 16th St. Information: +1-212-414-5994;

list and inventive crostini.  637 Hudson St; +1-212-242-3093.  (With assistance from  Manuela Hoelterhoff .  Jeremy Gerard  is
