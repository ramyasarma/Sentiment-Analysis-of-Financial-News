Estonia’s ruling coalition reached
an agreement on the main principles of a draft bill on
restructuring debts of private citizens,  Eesti Paeevaleht 
reported, citing the chairman of the parliament’s legal affairs’
committee.  The bill could be passed “within a month” and take effect
in March or April, Ken-Marti Vaher, a member of the junior
coalition party Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit, told the newspaper.
An agreement was reached after Premier Andrus Ansip’s Reform
Party dropped its requirement that creditors would be allowed to
veto any debt restructuring by court, the paper said.  The bill “plans to give court judges relatively free hands
to decrease debts, which means banks may decide to discontinue
the lowering of interest margins and to  curb lending ,” the
central bank said on Sept. 29. In turn, this would slow economic
growth and the decline in unemployment, it said then.  To contact the reporters on this story:
