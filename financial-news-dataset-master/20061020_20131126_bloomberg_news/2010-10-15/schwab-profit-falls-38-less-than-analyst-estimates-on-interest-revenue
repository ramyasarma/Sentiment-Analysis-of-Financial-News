Charles Schwab Corp. , the largest
independent brokerage by client assets, reported third-quarter
profit that beat the average analyst estimate as sales from
earned interest offset a decline in trading revenue.  Net income fell to $124 million, or 10 cents a  share , from
$200 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier, the San Francisco-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts  estimated 
profit of 9 cents, according to the average in a Bloomberg
survey.  The brokerage has been weathering a near-zero interest rate
environment since December 2008. About one third of last year’s
 revenue  came from interest earned on cash in its bank and money
market funds, while about 45 percent was from fees for managing
and administering assets. Third quarter results included a
charge of about $132 million to cover losses related to 2008
investments in mortgage-backed securities in its money market
fund, as the company had disclosed last month.  “Operating earnings at Schwab should continue to grow as
the company builds its client asset base and balance sheet,
lowers its cost of funds, and reinvests lower-yielding cash into
longer-dated securities,” Matt Snowling, an analyst with
Arlington, Virginia-based FBR Capital Markets, wrote in a Sept.
15 note.  Schwab said it also took a pretax charge of about $20
million for ending a credit-card sponsorship, according to a
Sept. 15 statement. Schwab trades at 16.3 times 2011 estimated
earnings, the cheapest since July 2009, according to Bloomberg
data.  The  shares  rose 0.8 percent to $14.20 at 9:10 a.m. New York
time. Before today, they had lost 25 percent year-to-date. That
compares with a 5.3 percent gain in the S&P 500 and a 7.2
percent decline for the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer
Index.  Competitors E*Trade Financial Corp. and  TD Ameritrade
Holding Corp.  are scheduled to report quarterly results next
week. Analysts expect E*Trade to post a profit of 4 cents a
share, while TD Ameritrade should return a gain of 23 cents,
according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
