Arthur G. Nadel , the Florida hedge-
fund manager who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in a $168
million Ponzi scheme, deserves as many as 24 years in prison,
U.S. prosecutors said.  “He wreaked havoc and devastation on the peaceful lives of
at least 390 people across the country,”  Reed M. Brodsky , an
assistant U.S. attorney, wrote in an Oct. 13 sentencing
memorandum. “He was nothing more than a professional con man”
who “lied every day.”  In the memo, prosecutors suggest a term of between 19 1/2
and 24 years “to reflect the seriousness of his offenses.”  Nadel, 77, of Sarasota, Florida, pleaded guilty to fraud in
February, and is scheduled for sentencing before Judge  John Koeltl  in Manhattan on Oct. 21.  At the plea hearing, Nadel said, “I fabricated inflated
rates of return for my trading activities,” and “I am
profoundly sorry for what I have done.”  The case is U.S. v. Arthur Nadel, 09CR433 (JGK), U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
