Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. , a
Japanese maker of waste-management systems, agreed to buy
 Hansen Transmissions International NV ’s industrial gearbox unit
for 75 million euros ($105 million) to expand in Europe.  Sumitomo will use the acquisition to drive expansion in the
U.S., Asia, Brazil and the U.K., according to a statement from
Antwerp, Belgium-based Hansen. Hansen rose as much as 17 percent
to 53.5 pence in London trading, the most in 18 months.  The Japanese manufacturer is seeking to bolster its
machinery-components business in emerging markets and is
investing an additional 10 billion yen ($123.2 million) in China
to expand in reduction gears and excavators. Hansen is gaining
new customers in China as part of a geographic expansion, Chief
Executive Officer  Alex De Ryck  said in July.  Hansen will focus exclusively on wind-energy gearboxes
following the disposal, it said. Under the terms of the accord,
its plant in Edegem, Belgium will be restructured to phase out
wind-gearbox lines, with the loss of as many as 125 jobs.  Wind energy accounted for 84 percent of Hansen’s revenue in
fiscal year 2010, while its industrial gearbox unit represented
around 16 percent of sales, according to the statement. The
Edegem revamp will lower Hansen’s wind-gearbox manufacturing
capacity by 1,100 mega watts or 13 percent.  The offer for Hansen, which employs 730 people worldwide,
offer is expected to close before March 31.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
