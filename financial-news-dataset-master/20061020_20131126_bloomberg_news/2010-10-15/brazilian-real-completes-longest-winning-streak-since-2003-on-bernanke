The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures posted the biggest weekly drop in two months on
speculation a new government may cut spending after a poll
showed opposition presidential candidate  Jose Serra  gained
ground.  The yield on the benchmark contract due in January 2012
fell 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 11.22 percent
this week at 5 p.m. New York time, from 11.43 on Oct. 8. It was
the biggest five-day decline since the week ended Aug. 20. The
yield dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
today.  Serra, who pledged to be fiscally “responsible,” is
closing a 14 percentage point gap with former Cabinet chief
 Dilma Rousseff  ahead of a runoff election later this month. He
had 47.7 percent support, trailing Rousseff by 4.6 percentage
points, in a Sensus poll of 2,000 people published yesterday.
Rousseff won 47 percent of the first-round vote on Oct. 3,
compared with 33 percent for Serra.  “You’ve had a very, very big drop in rates over the past
couple of days,” said  Tony Volpon , a Latin America strategist
at Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York, in a
telephone interview. “The thinking is Serra would be much
tougher on the fiscal side, would cut spending, and that
eventually would allow rates to drop in Brazil.”  The real was little changed for the week at 1.6651 per
dollar from 1.6661 on Oct. 8. The currency decreased 0.3 percent
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
