ICAP Plc , the world’s largest broker
of trades between banks, said Group Finance Director  Matthew Lester  is leaving to join the Royal Mail Group Ltd. and will be
replaced by  Iain Torrens .  Lester will leave “after a suitable handover period” and
after the publication of ICAP’s half-year results, the London-
based broker said in a statement. His replacement Torrens has
been ICAP’s group financial controller since 2008.  The broker said Sept. 30 that pretax  profit  for the year
ending March 30, 2011 will be in line with analysts’ estimates
of 333 million pounds ($535 million) to 357 million pounds. ICAP
is scheduled to report its first-half results on Nov. 17.  ICAP fell 2.6 pence, or 0.5 percent, to 475.3 pence at 2:28
p.m. in London. The broker’s stock has gained 10 percent this
year, valuing the company at 3.1 billion pounds.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
