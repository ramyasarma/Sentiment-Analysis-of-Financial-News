Developing-nation currencies
strengthened against the dollar and the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index pared losses after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said additional monetary stimulus may be warranted.  The Turkish lira gained 0.4 percent versus the U.S.
currency at 8:37 a.m. in New York, poised for the biggest
advance in five days. Brazil’s real appreciated 0.3 percent and
the Chilean peso rose 0.7 percent. The MSCI  gauge  of shares in
21 developing nations slipped 0.2 percent, after earlier falling
as much as 0.5 percent.  “There would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case
for further action,” Bernanke said today in the text of remarks
given at a Boston Fed conference. He said the central bank could
expand asset purchases or change the language in its statement,
while saying “nonconventional policies have costs and
limitations that must be taken into account in judging whether
and how aggressively they should be used.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
