China has begun ordering soybean
oil from Argentine suppliers after the government lifted six-
month old restrictions on imports from the South American
nation, three trading executives familiar with the deals said.  State-owned Cofco Ltd. ordered about 80,000 metric tons of
the cooking oil from South America this week, including
supplies from Argentina, said the executives, who declined to
be identified as they are not authorized to discuss the matter
publicly. The prices paid were about 8,800 yuan ($1,324) a ton
for immediate delivery, they said.  A call to the media contact numbers listed on the Cofco
website were not answered.  China halted shipments from Argentina, the largest
supplier, in April because of trade disputes ranging from
textiles to kitchen products. The move to ease restrictions
follows an improvement in relations between the two countries,
with Beijing in July agreeing to work on rail projects worth at
least $12 billion in Argentina.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
