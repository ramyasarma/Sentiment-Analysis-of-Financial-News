South Africa’s Reserve Bank is aware
of the impact the stronger and “volatile” rand is having on
the economy and will respond in a “considered manner,” the
bank’s Chief Economist Monde Mnyande said.  The bank is in talks with the National Treasury on options
available to address the rand’s strength, Mnyande said in a
speech in Johannesburg today, adding that any action must be
consistent with the bank’s inflation target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
