Gains in commodities in the past
week reflect increased global demand as much as the weakness of
the U.S. dollar, according to Barclays Plc.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  Index  of 24 raw materials headed
for an eighth weekly advance today, the longest streak since
1996. The  Dollar Index  lost 0.8 percent this week.  “While this price strength has been widely attributed to
the weakness of the dollar in the media, the underlying
fundamentals have continued to improve, making these price moves
justified,”  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan  and  Kerri Maddock , London-
based analysts at Barclays Capital, wrote in a report today.
“Oil demand growth in 2010 is now expected to be at its second
strongest in 30 years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
