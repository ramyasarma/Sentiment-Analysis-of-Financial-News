Poland’s economy may have expanded
at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter with
strong consumer demand and signs of reviving investment giving
“many positive signals” about the growth outlook, Michal Boni,
the senior policy adviser to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, was
quoted as saying today in an interview in Dziennik Gazeta
Prawna.  Bonia said it is “unrealistic” to expect the country’s
public-debt ratio will exceed 55 percent of gross domestic
product, a legal limit that would trigger mandatory austerity
measures.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
