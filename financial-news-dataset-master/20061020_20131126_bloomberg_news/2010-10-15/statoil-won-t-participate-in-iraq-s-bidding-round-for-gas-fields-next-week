Statoil ASA, Norway’s biggest oil
and gas producer, won’t participate in Iraq’s bidding round for
gas fields, spokesman Baard Glad Pedersen said on the phone
today.  “Our focus now is to develop West Qurna 2, one of the
world’s biggest oil fields, with Lukoil and we don’t plan to
participate in the licensing round for gas fields next week,”
Glad Pedersen said in a subsequent e-mail.  Statoil is among the 13 companies prequalified by the Iraqi
authorities to participate in the country’s third petroleum
licensing auction. The three fields offered in the licensing
round hold combined reserves of more than 11 trillion cubic
feet. The Stavanger-based company won rights in December to
develop Iraq’s West Qurna field with OAO Lukoil.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
