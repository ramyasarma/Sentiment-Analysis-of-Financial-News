President  Robert Mugabe  is reluctant
to extend a power-sharing agreement between his  Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front  and two factions of the  Movement
for Democratic Change , the  Herald  said, citing Mugabe.  Mugabe said he doesn’t want the two-year agreement, due to
end in February, extended for more than “a couple of months,”
the Harare-based Herald said on its website. Zimbabwe must hold
a national referendum to approve a new constitution before
elections to end the power-sharing agreement can be held, Mugabe
told the state-run newspaper, adding: “I do not see any reason
why we cannot do that.”  Zanu-PF and the two MDC factions have been sharing power
since February last year in an agreement brokered by the
Southern African Development Community after a March 2008
presidential election was marred by violence. A concurrent
parliamentary ballot was won by the MDC, led by  Morgan Tsvangirai , who was appointed prime minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
