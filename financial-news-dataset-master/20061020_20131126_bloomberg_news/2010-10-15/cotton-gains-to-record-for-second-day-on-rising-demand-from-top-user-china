Cotton futures jumped to a record
for the second consecutive day in New York on speculation that
China, the biggest user, may boost imports to meet demand from
domestic textile makers.  Cotton for December delivery surged as much as 4.3 percent
to $1.198, breaching yesterday’s record. It traded at $1.18 a
pound at 2:42 p.m. Singapore time, set for a 10 percent gain
this week.  China plans to auction 40,016 metric tons from state
reserves today, after selling 30,056 tons yesterday, according
to a statement on the CottonChina.org website.  “The Chinese have been running down their own domestic
stocks,” Wayne Gordon, an analyst at Rabobank Groep NV said by
phone from Sydney today. “They’re going to have to buy at the
global market to replenish that.”  Demand in China was forecast by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture to rise to 10.886 million tons in the 2010-2011
season, from 10.669 million tons a year earlier, creating a
“severe shortage,” that will cut the nation’s inventories.  China’s commercial cotton inventory, or stockpiles held by
non-government entities, was 107,000 tons in September, 98,000
tons lower than the previous month, the China Cotton Association
said yesterday. Xinjiang, the nation’s largest producing region,
has sold almost all of the crop harvested last year, the
association said.  China’s demand and imports are rising as the global market
heads for a deficit for a fifth straight year and La Nina
weather pattern, which can cause drier weather in South America
and rains in parts of Asia, fuel uncertainties on the fate of
the next crop, Gordon said.  -- Editors: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
