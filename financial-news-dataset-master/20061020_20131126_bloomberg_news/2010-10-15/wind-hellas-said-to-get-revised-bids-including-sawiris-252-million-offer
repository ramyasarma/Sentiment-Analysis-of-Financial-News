Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris 
submitted a revised offer for Wind Hellas Telecommunications SA
after lenders to the Greek telecommunications company failed to
agree on a preferred bidder, according to three people with
knowledge of the situation.  Sawiris is offering 180 million euros ($252 million) of
cash and plans to refinance Wind Hellas’s revolving-credit
facility by raising 290 million euros of bonds, said one of the
people, who declined to be identified because talks are private.
Holders of Athens-based Wind Hellas’s 1.2 billion euros of 
senior secured floating-rate notes will be offered 110 million
euros of bonds and 40 percent of the company, the person said.  Greece’s third-largest mobile-phone company requested
revised proposals earlier this week from bidders, including the
biggest Nordic phone operator  Telenor ASA  and Los Angeles-based
investment firm Saban Capital Group Inc., after talks between
creditors to select a buyer broke down, the people said. A group
of senior bondholders also has sought to take over Wind Hellas.  Wind Hellas said in a statement yesterday it expects to
make a choice “in the near term,” without being specific.  Under Sawiris’s proposal, senior secured bondholders will
get the chance to invest in Wind Hellas, while holders of its
subordinated bonds will be wiped out, according to the person
with knowledge of that bid.  Louise Tingstrom , an outside spokeswoman for Wind Hellas in
London, declined to comment, while  Scott Engebrigtsen , a
spokesman for Telenor in Fornebu, Norway, couldn’t be reached
for comment outside of office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
