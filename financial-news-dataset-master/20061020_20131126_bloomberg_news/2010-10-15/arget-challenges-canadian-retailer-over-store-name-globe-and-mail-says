Target Corp.  is challenging a
Canadian retailer who is opening stores under its name and
potentially causing problems for an expansion in Canada, the
Globe and Mail reported.  The U.S. chain is going before Canadian trademark
authorities today to contest the right of Toronto fashion
merchant Isaac Benitah to use the Target name, the newspaper
said.  Target lost a 2002 challenge against Benitah, who has owned
the rights to the name in Canada for almost a decade, when the
case was decided by the Federal Court of Appeal, the Globe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
