China’s stocks fluctuated on
concerns that this week’s rally was excessive, overshadowing a
rally for lenders.  The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent to
2,872.02 at 9:48 a.m. local time. It has gained 4.8 percent this
week, the most since July. The CSI 300 dropped 0.2 percent to
3,218.69, led by energy and material stocks. A gauge of energy
stocks has jumped 20 percent this month, while a measure of
material producers has gained 15 percent, the most among the 10
industry groups.  Bank stocks gained today on the prospect of increased fund
flows and as some lenders such as Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd. had their Hong Kong share-price estimates boosted by
Citigroup Inc.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
