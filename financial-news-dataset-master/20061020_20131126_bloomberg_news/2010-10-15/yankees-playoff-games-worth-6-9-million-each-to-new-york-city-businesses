Each Major League Baseball playoff
game at Yankee Stadium this year is worth $6.9 million to city
businesses, according to data from the New York City  Economic
Development Corp.   The figure, which is $200,000 more than data from last
year’s playoffs showed, includes money spent by visiting fans,
players and media on hotels, retail businesses, transportation
and dining, assuming that 34,150 people attend the game who do
not live in the area, the analysis said.  Indirect benefits to New York bring the total economic
benefit of each game to $12.2 million, $300,000 more than in
2009, according to the group.  Payroll spending is expected to be $900,000 per game,
including $260,000 for seasonal and contract employees at the
Bronx ballpark.  The Yankees, who earned a wild card berth to the playoffs
as the top second-place team in the American League’s three
divisions, played one game at Yankee Stadium in sweeping the
Minnesota Twins in the division series. New York will have as
many as six more playoff games there if they top the Texas
Rangers in the Championship Series in at least five games, and
then the World Series reaches a fifth contest.  The Yankees and Rangers tonight begin their best-of-seven
series in Arlington, Texas. New York is seeking to defend its
World Series title and claim its  28th championship .  To contact the reporter on this story:
