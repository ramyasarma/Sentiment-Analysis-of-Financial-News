Brazil’s antitrust regulator, known
as  Cade , said it hasn’t yet imposed any restrictions or
conditions on Telefonica SA’s purchase of a stake in Vivo
Participacoes SA.  Cade will make a decision on the Vivo acquisition after it
receives the results of a study by Brazil’s telecommunications
regulator, a Cade representative at Inpress Porter Novelli  said
in an e-mail in response to a report in O Estado de S. Paulo
today.  Estado said the antitrust regulator may impose conditions
on the takeover.  To contact the reporter on this story:
