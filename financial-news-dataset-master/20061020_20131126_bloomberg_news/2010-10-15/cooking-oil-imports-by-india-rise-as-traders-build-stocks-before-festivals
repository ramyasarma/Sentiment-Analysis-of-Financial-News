Vegetable oil imports by India, the
biggest consumer after China, climbed 6 percent in September
after traders boosted purchases to meet demand before the Diwali
festival next month.  Purchases reached 960,752 metric tons, from 905,192 tons a
year ago, the Solvent Extractors’  Association of India  said by
e-mail. Imports in the 11 months ended Sept. 30 rose 5 percent
to 8.41 million tons, the group said.  Increased imports by India, the biggest palm-oil buyer, may
help support prices in Kuala Lumpur that have rebounded to the
highest level in 26 months from near an eight-month low in July.
The Asian nation overtook China last year as the biggest
consumer of the tropical commodity.  December-delivery futures today advanced as much as 1.1
percent to 2,948 ringgit ($955) a ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the highest since Aug. 1, 2008. The
contract traded at 2,940 ringgit at the 12:30 p.m. trading
break, gaining 6.5 percent this week.  Vegetable oil stockpiles in India were at 1.5 million tons
on Oct. 1, from 1.38 million tons a month earlier, as traders
increased inventory to meet festival demand, the group said. The
peak season for the country’s edible oils demand began in August
with Ramadan and will conclude with Diwali in Nov. 5.  Imports of crude palm oil surged to 588,618 tons last month
from 544,091 tons a year ago, while soybean oil imports climbed
to 189,930 tons from 110,205 tons, as the premium of the
vegetable oil over palm oil narrowed, the association said.  Palm oil makes up almost 80 percent of India’s purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
