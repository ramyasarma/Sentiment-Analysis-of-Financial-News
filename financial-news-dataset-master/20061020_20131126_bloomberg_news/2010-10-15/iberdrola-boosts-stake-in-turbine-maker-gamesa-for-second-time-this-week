Iberdrola SA  increased its stake in
Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA for a second time this week
after the Spanish wind turbine maker announced plans to boost
sales in the U.S. and China.  Iberdrola, Gamesa’s largest shareholder, increased its
holding by 0.18 percentage points to 14.975 percent, an
Iberdrola spokeswoman said today in an e-mail. That followed an
increase of 0.22 percentage points on Oct. 13.  Gamesa  shares have fallen 12 percent since Chief Executive
Officer  Jorge Calvet  said its plan to increase revenue will
lower profit margins next year as the Zamudio, northern Spain-
based company invests in new generators. Casa Grande Cartagena
SL, the investment company of Spain’s billionaire Del Pino
family, sold its 5.6 percent stake in the company last month.  Calvet said sales will reach 4 gigawatts by 2013 compared
with 2.5 gigawatts forecast for this year. Gamesa will increase
investment to 250 million euros in 2011 from 150 million euros
this year, reducing its profit margin to about 4.5 percent.  Iberdrola paid 4.70 euros per share for the investment
announced today, the spokeswoman said.  Gamesa rose 1.1 percent to 4.74 euros as of 12:05 p.m. in
Madrid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
