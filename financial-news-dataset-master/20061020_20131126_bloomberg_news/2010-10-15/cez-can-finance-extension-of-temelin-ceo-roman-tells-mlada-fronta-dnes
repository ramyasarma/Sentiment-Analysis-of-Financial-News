While CEZ slashed down its planned
investments to 333 billion koruna ($19 billion) from 425 billion
koruna, its ability to finance the extension of Temelin nuclear
plant remains intact, Mlada Fronta Dnes reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Martin Roman.  The bidding process has been delayed because the bidders
need to demonstrate they can deliver on time and on budget, MFD
reported Roman as saying.  CEZ currently isn’t planning to sell assets in Poland and
Bulgaria, Roman told MFD. It will continue to invest into coal
plants in the Czech Republic, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
