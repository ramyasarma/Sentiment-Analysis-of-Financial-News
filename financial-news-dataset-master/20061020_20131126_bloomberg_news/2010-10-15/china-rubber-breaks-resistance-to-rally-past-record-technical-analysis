Rubber’s rally to a record today
in China may be extended after prices broke a key resistance
level and demand rises amid tight supply, according to
technical analysis by Yongan Futures Co.  The breaking of 30,000 yuan ($4,513) a metric ton was a key
resistance level, Guo Cheng, analyst at Yongan, said by phone
from Beijing. Resistance is a level on a chart where sell
orders may be clustered, and support is a level where there may
be buy orders.  “Rubber futures in China have decisively broken
resistance for two days, establishing a bull trend that will
see prices advance further,” Guo said. Rubber futures had been
range-bound between 17,000 yuan and 29,800 yuan in the previous
five years, he said.  Natural rubber for March delivery, the most-active
contract traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, reached a
record 31,800 yuan a ton today, brining the gain this year to
30 percent. The contract climbed 0.4 percent to 31,695 yuan at
10:11 a.m. local time.  Natural rubber  imports  by China, the world’s largest user,
jumped 19 percent from a month earlier to 190,000 tons in
September, the customs said on Oct. 13. China’s total imports
in the first nine months gained 2 percent to 1.34 million tons.  “The rally has further upward momentum as market
sentiment is now buoyed amid tight supply and loose monetary
conditions around the world,” Guo said. “The adverse weather
in China has also hampered production.”  A severe drought in Yunnan at the beginning of this year
and the recent torrential rains in Hainan, the top two
producers in China, will reduce domestic output, he added.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts look at
price charts to forecast resistance levels, or ceilings
restricting further price increases, and support levels, or
floors limiting declines.  -- Feiwen Rong . Editors: Richard Dobson, Matthew Oakley.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
