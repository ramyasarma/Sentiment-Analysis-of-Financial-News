China may allow companies to use
yuan for cross-border investment to help expand international
trade settlement in the currency, said Li Bo, a senior official
at the People’s Bank of China.  The  central bank  is studying rules that would permit use of
the yuan by overseas companies for foreign-direct investment, Li,
a director of the PBOC’s monetary policy division, said at a
financial conference in Beijing today. It’s also considering
allowing Chinese firms to invest yuan abroad, he said.  China is promoting greater use of the yuan to reduce
reliance on the U.S. dollar after Premier Wen Jiabao said in
March he is “worried” about holdings of assets denominated in
the greenback. The Dollar  Index  traded on ICE futures in New
York, which tracks the currency against those of six major
trading partners, has fallen 13.6 percent since June 7.  The use of yuan for cross-border trade settlement has been
expanded to a total of 20 provinces and cities, the People’s
Bank of China said June 22, almost a year after such payments
were approved for five cities.  The  PBOC  said on Aug. 17 it would let overseas financial
institutions invest yuan holdings in the nation’s interbank bond
market.  -- Dingmin Zhang ,  Judy Chen ,  Yanping Li . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,
