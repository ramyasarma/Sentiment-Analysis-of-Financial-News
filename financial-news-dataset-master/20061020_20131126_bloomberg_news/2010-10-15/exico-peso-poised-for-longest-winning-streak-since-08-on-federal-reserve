Mexico’s peso bond yields had the
biggest decline in two weeks, after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that more monetary stimulus may be necessary to
spur economic growth.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 6.389 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price fell 1.06 centavo to
133.55 centavos per peso. The yield declined eight basis points
this week, the biggest weekly decline since the week ending
Sept. 3.  “Bernanke today confirmed that they will go ahead with
more liquidity,” said  Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin America
fixed-income research at IDEAglobal in New York. “You are
seeing buying the rumor, sell the news.”  Additional stimulus may be necessary because inflation is
too low and unemployment is too high, Bernanke said in Boston
today at a Fed conference. The Fed said last month that it is
ready to ease monetary policy by buying assets.  The peso dropped 0.2 percent to 12.4343 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.4125 yesterday. The currency had its
first weekly decline since the week ending Aug. 27.  Mexico’s central bank held the overnight benchmark lending
rate at a record low 4.5 percent today, and said inflation will
remain below policy makers’ forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
