The rand may strengthen to 6.20 per
dollar in a year as the U.S. currency weakens amid concern the
American economy is struggling to maintain its recovery,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy may appreciate to
6.75 per dollar in the next three months and 6.30 in six months’
time,  Colin Coleman , the managing director of the bank’s local
unit, said in a speech in Johannesburg today.  Goldman is “much more bearish” on the dollar’s outlook
than the market, Bell said. “The bearish dollar outlook is of
course fundamental to how currencies trade and obviously that
has a positive bearing on gold and a strengthening bias on the
rand.”  The euro will climb to $1.50 in six months and $1.55 in a
year, Coleman said. Gold, which together with platinum accounts
for about a fifth of South Africa’s export earnings, reached a
record $1,387.35 an ounce yesterday as the dollar weakened. The
euro is forecast to reach $1.33 by the end of the year, $1.32 at
the end of March and $1.33 at the end of 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The European common currency gained 0.7
percent to $1.4156 by 1:31 p.m. in London.  The dollar slid toward a 15-year low versus the yen after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said additional
monetary stimulus may be warranted because inflation is too low
and unemployment is too high.  Rand Gains  The rand strengthened as much as 0.6 percent to 6.7616 to
the dollar, the strongest since January 2008, and last traded
0.3 percent higher at 6.7835 per dollar at 2:33 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  The South African currency has gained 39 percent against
the dollar since the beginning of last year as near-zero
interest rates in the U.S., Japan and the euro-region countries
fuelled demand for higher-yielding assets in emerging markets.
South Africa has a benchmark rate of 6 percent.  Policy makers are “concerned” about the appreciation and
are considering ways to curb the currency, central bank Governor
 Gill Marcus  said yesterday. The strength of the rand has
prompted exporters and labor unions to lobby the central bank to
step up efforts to weaken it.  National Treasury Director-General  Lesetja Kganyago  said
today countries that are taking individual actions to curb their
currencies are embarking on a “race to the bottom.” This
strategy requires “deep pockets,” which South Africa doesn’t
have, Kganyago said in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
