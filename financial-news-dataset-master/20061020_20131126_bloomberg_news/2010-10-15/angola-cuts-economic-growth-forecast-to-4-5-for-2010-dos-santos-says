Angola’s government cut its economic
growth forecast for the third time in three months, President
 Jose Eduardo dos Santos  said.  “We expect growth of 4.5 percent,” dos Santos told
lawmakers in the capital, Luanda, in his first State of the
Union speech after three decades of power. “There is a concrete
perspective to accelerate to about 8 percent in 2011.”  Angola, which relies on oil for about 60 percent of gross
domestic production, cut its economic growth forecast on Sept.
29 to between 5 and 6 percent from 6.7 percent on Aug. 3. In
March the government’s estimate was 9.7 percent.  The southwest African country is rebuilding after a 27-year
civil war that ended in 2002 and is beginning to open up its
economy. The government has paid $2.7 billion of $6.8 billion in
debt owed to Portuguese and Brazilian construction companies,
Dos Santos said in the speech, required under a constitution
approved in February. The rest is to be paid by the first
quarter of 2011, according to Dos Santos.  The government’s failure to honor debt “is making
importers review their investment” in Angola, Victor de Morais,
an economist at the Luanda-based Universidade Independente de
Angola, said by phone today. “The state is creating
constraints, forcing importers to bring in goods less
frequently. The government needs to review its fiscal
policies.”  Angola’s foreign-currency reserves reached $12.64 billion
at the end of the third quarter, dos Santos said. Reserves were
about $15 billion in August, according to a revised budget.  The government’s top priority is to build better housing
for the 70 percent of the population living in substandard
conditions, dos Santos said. It will require a “gigantic
effort” to solve, he said.  He also reaffirmed the country will hold elections in 2012.
Under the new constitution, the leader of the party with the
most seats in parliament becomes president. The leader can serve
two five-year terms. The 68-year-old Dos Santos, in power since
1979, could serve until 2022.  Angola pumps about 1.9 million barrels of oil a day, behind
Nigeria and Algeria in Africa, according to the BP Plc’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
