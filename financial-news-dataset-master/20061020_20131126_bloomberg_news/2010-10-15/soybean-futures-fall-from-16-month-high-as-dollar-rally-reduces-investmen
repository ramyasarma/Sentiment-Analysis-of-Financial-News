Soybeans fell from the highest price
since June 2009 as a stronger dollar reduced investment demand
for commodities as an alternative asset.  The greenback advanced from an eight-month low against the
euro and traded up from a 15-year low versus the yen. Hedge-fund
bets on higher prices rose to a record in the week ended Sept.
28, before falling last week.  “The dollar’s rally today was enough for some funds to cut
positions,” said  Jerry Gidel , a market analyst for North
American Risk Management Services Inc. in Chicago. “The market
has rallied as a weaker dollar increased investment flows” into
commodities and out of stocks and bonds, Gidel said.  Soybean futures for January delivery dropped 3.25 cents, or
0.3 percent, to close at $11.9575 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price jumped to $12.145,
the highest level for a most-active contract since June 2009.
The oilseed surged 23 percent in the third quarter.  The price rose earlier after reports showed rising demand
from importers including China for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s largest grower and exporter.  Shippers sold 518,803 metric tons to China and unknown
buyers for delivery before Aug. 31, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today.  Sales  in the week ended Oct. 7 rose 17
percent to 1.109 million tons from a week earlier, including 53
percent to China, the biggest consumer, the USDA said in a
separate report. Soybean prices are up 32 percent since the end
of June.  “Chinese demand continues to grow,” said  Mark Schultz ,
the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
Minneapolis. “As long as the Chinese are buying, the market is
not going to retreat very far.”  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
