Treasury traders increased bets on
inflation for a third week on speculation the Federal Reserve
will succeed in its efforts to spur prices in the U.S. economy.  The  difference  between yields on 30-year bonds and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, widened to 2.57 percentage points from 2.12
percentage points on Oct. 1. The spread widened past the five-
year average of 2.40 percentage points.  “There’s not much room for yields to fall,” said  Kazuaki Oh’e , a debt salesman in Tokyo at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, the nation’s fifth-largest lender. “There is an
inflation fear.”  The 30-year bond yielded 3.95 percent as of 9:47 a.m. in
Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data. The 3.875 percent
security maturing in August 2040 traded at a price of 98 23/32.  Treasuries  fell yesterday as investors balked at low yields
amid speculation about whether the Fed will buy debt to spur the
economy and, if so, how much.  St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  proposed that the
central bank buy $100 billion in long-term Treasuries next month
and consider more purchases later.  “In terms of Treasuries, I wouldn’t touch them with a 10-
foot pole, except maybe on the short side,”  Steven Leuthold ,
whose Leuthold Core Investment Fund has beaten 88 percent of its
rivals in the past five years, said in an interview with  Betty Liu  on “In the Loop” on Bloomberg Television. “Yields are so
skimpy it makes no sense for people to be putting money in
anything other than very, very short-term bonds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
