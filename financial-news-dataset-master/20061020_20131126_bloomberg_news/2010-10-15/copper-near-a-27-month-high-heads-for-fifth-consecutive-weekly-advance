Copper rose, capping the fifth
straight weekly gain, on speculation that demand will improve as
the Federal Reserve takes additional steps to spur U.S. economic
growth.  The central bank may expand asset purchases to stimulate
the economy because inflation is too low and the unemployment
rate is almost 10 percent, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said today
at a Boston Fed conference. Yesterday, copper surged to a 27-
month high as the dollar declined.  “Copper got a boost from Bernanke’s preparatory remarks,”
said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage
Services in Chicago. “It’s a bit of a surprise how firm he is
on taking more quantitative easing.”  Copper futures for December delivery gained 2.35 cents, or
0.6 percent, to close at $3.8390 a pound at 1:18 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Yesterday, the price reached $3.8675, the
highest level for a most-active contract since July 2008.  This week, the metal climbed 1.7 percent. The fifth
consecutive gain marked the longest rally since August 2009.  Futures may reach $4 by the end of the month, McGhee said.
The price has jumped 33 percent since July 1 as the dollar’s
slump enhanced the allure of raw materials, and  inventories  of
copper tracked by the London Metal Exchange dropped to the
lowest level in a year.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months was
unchanged at $8,400 a metric ton ($3.81 a pound).  Lead and zinc gained, while tin, nickel and aluminum
dropped.  To contact the reporters on this story:
