Copper dropped for the first time in
four days from a 27-month high as the dollar’s rebound eroded
the appeal of commodities as alternative investments.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to $8,360 a metric ton,
before trading at $8,361.25 a ton by 8:03 a.m. Singapore time.
Copper rose to $8,490 a ton yesterday, the highest level since
July 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
