The spot price of emission credits
in New Zealand’s carbon market were unchanged this week,
Auckland-based broker OMFinancial Ltd. said today.  Carbon credits were NZ$20 ($15.13) a ton, the broker said
in an e-mailed statement. Companies in New Zealand that emit
greenhouse gases have the option to pay a tax of NZ$25 a ton of
emissions or buy carbon credits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
