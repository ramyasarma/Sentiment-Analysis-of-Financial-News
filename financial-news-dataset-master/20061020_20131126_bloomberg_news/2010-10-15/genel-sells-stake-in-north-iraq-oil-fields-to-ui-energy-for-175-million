Turkey’s Genel Energy International
agreed to sell stakes in three oil fields in northern Iraq to UI
Energy Corp. for $175 million.  Genel sold a 5 percent interest in the Dohuk and Tawke
fields and 10 percent of Miran, the Ankara-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today. The transactions need to be
approved separately by the Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq,
the company said.  Genel said it will use the money raised from the sale to
develop production at Taq Taq, another northern Iraq concession
it holds, as well as pipeline construction and exploratory
drilling in the region. It said it plans to invest as much as
$900 million in those activities in 2011 and 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
