Wheat futures rose for the first
time in three days on speculation that dry weather in the U.S.
may harm the winter crop now being planted.  Most growing areas in the Great Plains and Midwest may not
get any rain in the next five days, according to a report from
T-Storm Weather LLC. Some fields in the Midwest have had less
than 25 percent of the average rainfall in the past two months,
and parts of the Plains are experiencing “substantial
dryness,” the forecaster said.  Dry weather “is supportive, there’s no doubt about that,”
said  Jon Marcus , the president of Lakefront Futures and Options
in Chicago.  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 3.75 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $7.045 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The commodity was down 2.1 percent for
the week, the third decline in four weeks.  Earlier, wheat dropped as much as 0.8 percent, as a rebound
in the dollar raised speculation that U.S. exports would shrink.
The  dollar  climbed as much as 0.6 percent today against a basket
of six major currencies, rebounding from a 10-month low.  The U.S. sold about 377,000 metric tons of wheat to
importers in the week ended Oct. 7, less than half the amount of
the previous week, the Department of Agriculture said today.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
