Cencosud SA , Chile’s largest
retailer by sales, agreed to buy Brazilian supermarket operator
Bretas, increasing its presence in Latin America’s largest
economy.  Cencosud will pay 1.35 billion reais ($811 million) for the
privately-held owner of 62 supermarkets, three distribution
centers and 10 service stations in central and northern Brazil,
according to a  statement  posted today on the website of Chile’s
securities regulator.  “With this strategic acquisition Cencosud enters the
states of Minas Gerais and Goias, consolidating its position in
Brazilian supermarkets,” the Santiago-based retailer said in
the statement.  Cencosud Chairman  Horst Paulmann  resumed an expansion
program late last year as Chile’s economy recovered from its
steepest slump in a decade. Paulmann, a German-born
entrepreneur, spent about $1 billion buying up retailers in
Brazil and Peru and expanding the Easy home-improvement chain to
Colombia in the year before the global financial crisis slowed
consumer spending in Latin America.  Bretas, controlled by the Duarte De Assis family, employs
about 10,000 people, had sales of 2.1 billion reais last year
and may generate revenue of 2.5 billion reais this year,
according to today’s statement.  Cencosud  has surged 88 percent in Santiago trading this
year, outpacing the Ipsa index’s 32 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
