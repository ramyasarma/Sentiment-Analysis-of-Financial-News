Brazil’s real is poised for a ninth
straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak in seven years,
as investors bet the U.S. will take additional measures to spur
an economic recovery that will devalue the dollar.  The real advanced 0.3 percent to 1.6617 per dollar at 11:01
a.m. New York time, from 1.6661 on Oct. 8. The currency
decreased 0.1 percent today. The real gained for 12 straight
weeks during the period ended May 9, 2003.  “It’s been driven by this idea that we’re going to get a
flood of liquidity coming from American quantitative easing, and
this will leak out of the United States and try to find a home
in relatively safe high-yielding countries or currencies, and
the real certainly seems to fit that bill,” said  Tony Volpon , a
Latin America strategist at Nomura Securities International Inc.
in New York, in a telephone interview.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his central
bank colleagues are considering ways they can stimulate the
economy as the unemployment rate holds near 10 percent and
inflation falls short of their goals. Bernanke said today that
additional monetary stimulus may be warranted.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 was unchanged at 11.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
