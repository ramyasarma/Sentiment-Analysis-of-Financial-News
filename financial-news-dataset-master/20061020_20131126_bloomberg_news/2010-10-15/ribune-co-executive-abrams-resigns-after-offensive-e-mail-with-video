Lee Abrams , the chief innovation
officer at  Tribune Co. , resigned after he was suspended for
distributing an e-mail with video links employees found
“offensive,” according to a company statement to employees.  “Effective immediately, Lee will no longer be an employee
of Tribune,” Chief Executive Officer  Randy Michaels  said in the
statement. Abrams was suspended earlier this week, Michaels
said. A spokesman didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail and
phone call for comment.  Tribune Co., the Chicago-based owner of the Chicago
Tribune, the Los Angeles Times and cable and broadcast
television outlets, has been operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection since December 2008, a year after it was
taken private in a buyout led by real estate investor  Sam Zell .  To contact the reporter on this story:
