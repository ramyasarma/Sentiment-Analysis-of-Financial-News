Credit Agricole SA’s corporate and
investment banking unit plans to reduce weighted assets by 10
percent to help its parent company meet new Basel rules, Les
Echos reported, citing unidentified people.  The unit’s head Patrick Valroff made an internal
announcement on the plan yesterday, the newspaper cited the
people as saying. Pharmaceutical activities may be affected as
they were not included on a list of strategic areas, Les Echos
said. Credit Agricole CIB could also decide to pull out of
countries such as Canada, Israel, Yemen, Belgium and Mexico,
according to the newspaper.  Les Echos also cited other unidentified people as saying
that the bank may sell a correlation portfolio that generated
losses of 150 million euros in the first half of this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
