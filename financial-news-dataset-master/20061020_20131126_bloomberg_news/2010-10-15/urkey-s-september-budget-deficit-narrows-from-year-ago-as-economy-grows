Turkey’s  budget deficit  narrowed in
September from a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said.  The gap in the month was 6.9 billion liras ($4.9 billion),
down from 9.5 billion liras a year earlier, the ministry in
Ankara said on its website today. The so-called primary deficit,
before interest payments on debt, also narrowed to 2.9 billion
liras from 4.5 billion a year earlier.  Turkey on Oct. 10 revised its full-year deficit forecast to
44.2 billion liras from 50 billion liras as faster-than-forecast
 growth  helped generate higher revenues. The revised plans see a
deficit next year of 33.5 billion liras, a forecast that’s
“realistic, cautious even,” Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek 
told reporters today.  The deficit in the first nine months of this year was 21.3
billion liras, about half the gap in the same period of 2009.
Excluding payments on interest, the budget had a surplus of 18
billion liras.  Budget revenues rose 20 percent in the year to September,
while non-interest spending increased 12 percent and expenditure
on interest fell 14 percent, the ministry said.  The economy may expand 6.8 percent this year, according to
government forecasts. That’s almost double the estimate of 3.5
percent made when the budget was drawn up in October last year.
The forecast for next year is 4.5 percent.  Simsek said the government will submit 2011 spending plans
to parliament today for debate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
