Desire Petroleum Plc  slumped in
London trading after saying an exploration well failed to find
oil or gas off the Falkland Islands, where exploration has
provoked a diplomatic row between the U.K. and Argentina.  Desire  tumbled as much as 46 pence, or 42 percent, to 63.75
pence, the biggest drop since March 29. It was down 25 percent
at 82.75 pence at 10:07 a.m. London time. The 14/15-1 well on
the Rachel prospect was drilled to a depth of 2,877 meters
(9,439 feet) and “no hydrocarbons have been found,” the U.K.
company said today in a statement.  Shares in companies involved in Falkland exploration
including  Borders & Southern Petroleum Plc  and  Argos Resources
Ltd.  fell for a third day after  Rockhopper Exploration Plc  cited
its advisers as saying that resources may be lower than expected
in the offshore basin.  Borders dropped 3 percent to 64 pence in London trading;
Rockhopper fell 4 percent to 326.75 pence;  Falkland Oil & Gas
Ltd.  declined 5.2 percent to 108.5 pence; Argos plunged 9
percent to 40.5 pence. The 153-member MSCI ACWI ex
Australia/Energy  Index  slipped 0.1 percent.  Last month, Desire raised about 22.8 million pounds ($36.6
million) after selling 16.3 million shares at 140 pence each to
help fund its exploration campaign.  Rockhopper holds a 7.5 percent stake in the Rachel well, it
said today in a separate statement. Desire plans to drill a
sidetrack well into the deeper sandstones “closer to the mature
oil source rock” to “evaluate the prospectivity,” the
companies said.  ‘Major Risk’  The dry well “would appear to be the major risk now
associated with exploration in the area,”  Peter Hitchens , an
analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co., wrote in an e-mailed report.
“Although Rockhopper Exploration has made a very significant
discovery in the Falklands, it does not mean that all the other
prospects are likely to be successful.”  In May, Rockhopper discovered the Sea Lion field, which has
a potential for commercial oil production. Former Prime Minister
 Margaret Thatcher  went to war to defend the U.K.-controlled
region in 1982, which has been claimed by Argentina.  Desire, Rockhopper and Argos are exploring the North
Falklands Basin, while Falkland Oil and Borders operate in the
south, according to a report from Evolution Securities Ltd.
dated Sept. 10.  BHP Billiton Ltd. agreed to exit an exploration project
with Falkland Oil, the London-based company said Sept. 28.  In 1998, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Amerada Hess Corp., which
has changed its name to Hess Corp., Lasmo Plc, now controlled by
Eni SpA, and Lundin Petroleum AB drilled six wells in the basin,
with five indicating oil shows, according to Evolution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
