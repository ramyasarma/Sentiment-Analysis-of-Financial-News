Gold, trading near a record, may
decline this year before resuming an advance to $1,550 an ounce
in 12 months, LGT Capital Management said.  The metal may decline to $1,300 in three months, before
rising to $1,450 in six months, LGT analyst  Bayram Dincer  in
Pfaeffikon, Switzerland, said today in a report. Immediate-
delivery bullion yesterday reached a record $1,387.35 and traded
at $1,377.40 at 10:49 a.m. in London today.  “We see more upside potential if major central banks
continue with expansive monetary policy in the course of 2011
and postpone their exit strategy,” Dincer said.  Gold, up 26 percent this year, is heading for a 10th annual
gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920. Bullion
futures have also reached a record in India, and gold traded in
Canadian dollars today climbed to the highest price since at
least 1971. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will speak
on monetary policy objectives and tools in Boston today.  “The price of gold in most reference currencies is
overvalued and too high for tactical and strategic
investments,” Dincer said. “We recommend waiting for an
upcoming moderate correction and consolidation period.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
