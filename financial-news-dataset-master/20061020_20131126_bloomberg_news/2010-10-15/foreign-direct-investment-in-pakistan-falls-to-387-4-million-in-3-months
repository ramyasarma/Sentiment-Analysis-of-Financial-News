Foreign direct investment in
Pakistan fell 9.5 percent in the first quarter of the financial
year as European and American investors put less money into the
country battling Taliban militants in its northwest.  Overseas direct investment fell to $387.4 million in the
three months ended Sept. 30, from $427.9 million a year ago,
according to an e-mailed statement from the  central bank  in
Karachi today.  Pakistan needs overseas investment to support an economy
hurt by the nation’s worst floods that may stoke  inflation  to as
high as 20 percent and curb economic expansion to 2.5 percent in
the year through June, according to the government.  Countries from the European Union invested $46.3 million in
the first quarter, compared with $114.5 million a year ago,
according to the data. Investors from the United States put in
$61.3 million compared with $74 million a year earlier.  Companies in the United Arab Emirates invested $67.3
million, the most among all countries, compared with $29.5
million last year.  Overseas funds bought a net $67.7 million of Pakistani
 stocks  in the three month period, compared with net purchases of
$208.2 million a year ago. Investors in the United States bought
$97 million of Pakistani stocks, compared with $162 million a
year ago, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
