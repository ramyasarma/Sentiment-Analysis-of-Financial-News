Greek Prime Minister George
Papandreou said protests at the Acropolis archaeological site in
Athens, which has shut down the monument for a third day,
tarnished the image of Greece around the world.  “These workers, whose problems we have solved, padlocked
the entrance to the site, obstructing other workers from doing
their job and tarnishing the image of the country globally,”
Papandreou said in Parliament in Athens today. He said the
protests harmed tourism and the Greek economy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
