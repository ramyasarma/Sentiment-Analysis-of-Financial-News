Philadelphia Eagles quarterback
 Kevin Kolb  will get his third start of the season against the
Atlanta Falcons this weekend with  Michael Vick  still recovering
from injured ribs, the National Football League team said on  its
website .  Kolb, 26, threw for 253 yards and a touchdown in the
Eagles’ 27-24 victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Oct. 10.
It was his first start since suffering a concussion in Week 1
against the Green Bay Packers.  Vick, 30, started three games this season before suffering
a rib cartilage injury on Oct. 3 against the Washington
Redskins. He practiced today for the first time since the injury
and may be available as a backup on Oct. 17 against the Falcons,
his former team, the website said.  Kolb has passed for 478 yards and two touchdowns this
season. Vick, the NFL offensive player of the month for
September, has thrown for 799 yards and six touchdowns, and
rushed for 187 yards and one touchdown.  The Eagles are 3-2, tied for first place in the National
Football Conference East with the Washington Redskins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
