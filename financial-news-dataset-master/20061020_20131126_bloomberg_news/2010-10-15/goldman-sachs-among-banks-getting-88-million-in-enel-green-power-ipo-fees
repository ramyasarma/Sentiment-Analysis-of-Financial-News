Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and Italy’s
Mediobanca SpA are among banks that stand to receive as much as
63 million euros ($88 million) in fees for managing the initial
public offering of Enel SpA’s renewable-energy unit.  Enel will pay a commission of as much as 1.85 percent on
the IPO of Enel Green Power SpA, the Rome-based company said in
a filing today. Italy’s largest utility is selling as much as
3.4 billion euros of EGP shares in what may be Europe’s biggest
IPO in three years.  Securities firms charged an average fee of 3.3 percent on
$106.5 billion of global IPOs completed this year, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Fees for stock sales are on average higher in
Asia and the U.S. than in Europe, the data show.  Bank of America Corp., Intesa Sanpaolo’s Banca IMI SpA,
Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Morgan Stanley, UniCredit SpA and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA are managing the IPO with Goldman and Mediobanca.  To contact the reporter on this story:
