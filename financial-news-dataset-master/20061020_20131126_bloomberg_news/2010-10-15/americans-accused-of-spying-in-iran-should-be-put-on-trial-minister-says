Two Americans charged with illegally
entering Iran and espionage should be tried, Intelligence
Minister Heidar Moslehi said.  “There are documents and evidence about these American
detainees, which have been handed over to the judicial system in
order to decide,” Moslehi was  quoted  today by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.  Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal were detained in July 2009 with
a third U.S. citizen, Sarah Shourd, when they crossed into Iran
from Iraqi Kurdistan. The Obama administration says the three
were hikers who mistakenly wandered into Iran. Shourd was
granted clemency and left Iran Sept. 14.  Two other Westerners held by Iran, Germans accused of
posing as reporters to illegally gather information on a woman
sentenced to death by stoning, have admitted breaking the law,
state-run Press TV cited Prosecutor General Gholam-Hossein
Mohseni-Ejei as saying without providing details on the next
step that authorities will take in their case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
