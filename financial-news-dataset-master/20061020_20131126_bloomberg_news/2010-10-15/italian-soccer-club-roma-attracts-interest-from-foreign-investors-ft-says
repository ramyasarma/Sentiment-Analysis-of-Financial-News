AS Roma SpA, an Italian Serie A
soccer club that’s up for sale, has received expressions of
interest from almost a dozen investors, more than half of them
outside Italy, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified
people familiar with the matter.  Naguib Sawiris , an Egyptian businessman who sponsors Roma,
is one of them; others are in the U.S., China, Russia and India
and all are thought to be serious contenders, according to the
newspaper.  Roma was put on the market by UniCredit SpA in lieu of debt
repayments owed by Italpetroli SpA, the club’s parent company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
