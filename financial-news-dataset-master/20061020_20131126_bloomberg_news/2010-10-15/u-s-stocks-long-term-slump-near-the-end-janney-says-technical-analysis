U.S. stocks may stay in a tight
range for several more years as they near the end of a bearish
era characterized by declining interest rates and rising
commodity prices, according to Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.  The equity market began a long-term downturn between 1998
and 2000, with  valuations  tending to move lower ever since,  Dan Wantrobski , director of technical research at Janney Montgomery
Scott, wrote in a note to clients. Market cycles tend to last 15
to 20 years, meaning this one may end soon, he wrote.  The current environment is similar to the period 1928
through the late 1930s, when interest rates fell and commodity
prices rose, indicators that Wantrobski, who is based in
Philadelphia, said are the “hallmarks of a deflationary bear
cycle." The market "settled into a muted trading range after the
1938 lows" before the next bull market started in 1942. A bear
market from 1966 to 1982 was similar, Wantrobski said, with the
"nominal bottom" in 1974 and shares in a range for eight years
after that.  ‘‘The equity markets have conformed with the general
anatomy of these prior bear cycles thus far,’’ he said in the
note dated Oct. 13. ‘‘We therefore anticipate a more muted
trading range in the years ahead."  He added, "There are still a
few more years left before we embark upon the next secular
upwave.’’  Secular bull markets begin when stocks are "cheap" as
measured by the  price-to-earnings  ratio of a benchmark like the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, he said, and secular bear markets
begin when stocks are "expensive." The S&P 500’s P/E ratio will
keep trending lower ‘‘over the next few years” until it settles
near 10 on a monthly closing basis, Wantrobski wrote. The
gauge’s  current  P/E ratio is 15.5, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
