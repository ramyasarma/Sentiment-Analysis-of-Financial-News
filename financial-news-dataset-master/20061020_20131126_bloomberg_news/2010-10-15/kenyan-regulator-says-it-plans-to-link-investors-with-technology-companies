A panel set up by Kenya’s  Capital
Markets Authority  said it plans to link technology entrepreneurs
with mutual funds, venture capital companies and high net-worth
individuals to support their businesses.  The East Africa ICT Impact Investing Taskforce, which
comprises technology professionals, fund managers, donors and
regulators from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda, will hold
its last meeting in November before publishing its final
recommendations in January next year, Richard Bell, who heads
the taskforce, said in an interview in Nairobi.  “The problem was a lack of intermediation,” Bell said
yesterday. “Local capital was not finding its way into the
technology sector.”  Information technology and telecommunications companies
have increased investments in East Africa, with three cables now
bringing Internet to the region. The East African Submarine
System, a fiber-optic cable linking 20 African countries,
reached the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa on March 22. Seacom,
a link owned by Mauritius-based Seacom Ltd., was the first in
East Africa to go live in July 2009. The East African Marine
System fiber-optic cable, commonly known as Teams, started
operating in October.  In Kenya, 16 percent of the population has access to
Internet services, below the world average of 26 percent,
according to the  Communications Commission of Kenya .  The taskforce plans to set up business incubators to teach
technology entrepreneurs business management skills through
training courses, Bell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
