Sinochem Group has walked away from
attempts to put together a takeover offer for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., Reuters reported, citing sources with
knowledge of the matter that it didn’t identify.  Efforts to put together a deal to counter BHP Billiton
Ltd.’s hostile bid had finished, Reuters cited one of the people
as saying. A spokesman for Sinochem, which has never publicly
stated its intention to bid for Potash Corp., declined to
comment, Reuters said.  Last week, two people with knowledge of the matter said
Sinochem, China’s largest fertilizer trader, may struggle to get
state financial backing for a takeover.  China’s government had indicated it would prefer Sinochem
to finance any takeover without credit from state banks, which
may put the transaction beyond the company’s reach, the people
said last week, asking not to be identified because of
confidentiality.  Potash Corp.,  the world’s largest producer of its namesake
crop nutrient, in August rejected Melbourne-based  BHP ’s $40
billion offer as too low and said it’s seeking other bids.
Without government backing, state-owned banks are unlikely to
provide takeover financing to Sinochem, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
