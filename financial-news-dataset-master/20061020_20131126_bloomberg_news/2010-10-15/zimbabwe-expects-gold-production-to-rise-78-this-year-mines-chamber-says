Zimbabwe expects gold production to
rise 78 percent this year, David Matyanga, senior economist at
the country’s Chamber of Mines, said in an interview from
Harare.  Production in the year through September was 5.88 metric
tons, worth $224 million, Matyanga said today.  “We anticipate 2010 production to rise about 78 percent to
8.8 metric tons,” Matyanga said, adding that the output
included gold recovered by platinum miners.  Zimbabwe produced about 4.9 metric tons of gold in 2009,
worth $157 million, which was a 39 percent increase on the
previous year, the economist said.  “Electricity shortages remain the biggest challenge to
gold miners in Zimbabwe and most have been forced to invest in
diesel generators to bridge them during times of power cuts,”
Matyanga said. “The country needs urgent investment in the
energy sector for mining to reach its true potential.”  Zimbabwe’s gold production began to rise after Finance
Minister  Tendai Biti  allowed producers to sell their gold on the
international market in February last year. Previously gold had
to be sold to the central bank.  The southern African nation sold 29 tons of gold in 1999, a
year before a decade-long recession began. Inflation calculated
at 500 billion percent by the International Monetary Fund, cuts
in electricity and debt owed to miners by the central bank
subsequently closed most Zimbabwean gold producers.  South Africa’s Metallon Corp. Ltd. is Zimbabwe’s biggest
gold producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
