Asian currencies completed a seventh
weekly advance, led by the Singapore dollar, as relatively high
yields and the world’s fastest economic growth spurred demand
for assets in the region’s developing nations.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index  climbed to its
highest level since April 2008 on speculation central banks will
be more tolerant of currency gains after Singapore said
yesterday it will target faster appreciation in the next six
months. Equity funds investing in Asia excluding Japan have
taken in more than $1 billion in all but one of the past four
weeks, according to data from EPFR Global.  “With so much liquidity now, investors are seeking higher-
returns and Asia has been attracting those funds,” said  Minoru Shioiri , chief manager of currency trading in Tokyo at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. “Singapore’s
decision to allow a stronger currency seems to be an acceptance
of the weaker dollar trend.”  The Singapore dollar climbed 1.3 percent this week to
S$1.2956 as of 4:38 p.m. local time, its best performance in six
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. India’s rupee
climbed 0.9 percent to 44.035 after global funds pumped $1.1
billion into the nation’s equities in the first three days of
the week. Thailand’s baht strengthened 0.8 percent to 29.83, an
11th straight weekly gain.  Central banks in India, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan and
Thailand have raised interest rates this year to contain
inflation as their economies improve. Their counterparts in the
U.S. and Japan by contrast have near-zero rates and are buying
assets to inject funds and support growth.  Faster Appreciation  The Monetary Authority of Singapore said yesterday it will
steepen and widen the band in which its dollar trades against a
weighted basket of currencies, seeking a “modest and gradual”
advance. The Singapore dollar reached $1.2893 versus the
greenback after the bi-annual policy review, the strongest level
since at least 1981.  Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.4 percent in 2010,
compared with growth of 2.7 percent in advanced countries, the
International Monetary Fund forecast on Oct. 6. China’s gross
domestic product increased 10.5 percent from a year earlier in
the third quarter, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before and Oct. 21 report.  Yuan Pressure  The yuan rose to the strongest level since 1993 today on
speculation American lawmakers will step up calls for faster
appreciation after the U.S. yesterday said its trade deficit
with China widened to a record $28 billion in August. A twice-
annual report by the U.S. Treasury Department about whether
China manipulates its exchange rate is due today. The currency
has appreciated 0.5 percent this week to 6.6411.  “The political pressure is quite strong,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in
Sydney. “It makes both economic and strategic sense for China
to allow a strong currency.”  Malaysia’s ringgit climbed 0.9 percent to 3.0825 per dollar
this week, contributing to this year’s 11 percent advance. The
currency touched a 13-year high this week, as did Thailand’s
baht. The baht is Asia’s best-performing emerging-market
currency of 2010 with a 12 percent gain.  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar jumped 1 percent from a week ago
to NT$30.793. The Philippine peso rose 0.5 percent to 43.185 and
Indonesia’s rupiah was 0.2 percent stronger at 8,918.  To contact the reporters on this story:
