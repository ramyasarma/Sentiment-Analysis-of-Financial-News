Kenya’s plan to sell five state-
controlled sugar mills could be completed within six months, the
head of the country’s privatization agency said.  The east African nation’s Cabinet yesterday agreed to the
sales provided that the sugar factories’ debts are reorganized
and lawmakers approve the plan. The five mills together will
require an estimated investment of 58 billion shillings ($721
million) to modernize and expand, Solomon Kitungu, chief
executive officer of Kenya’s Privatization Commission, said by
phone from Nairobi today.  “The idea is that the money raised will be fresh
investment to go to the companies,” said Kitungu, who prepared
the proposal considered by the government, though he hasn’t yet
seen the final details. “Most of the excess debt is to be
written off.”  Most of the factories are “heavily indebted” and two of
them are in receivership, the Cabinet said in yesterday’s
statement. Shares in the mills would not immediately trade on
the  Nairobi Stock Exchange , as companies need three consecutive
years of profit to qualify for a listing, Kitungu said.  The mills are Nzoia, with an annual capacity of 54,000
metric tons; Chemelil, with 36,000 tons; Sony, with 78,000 tons;
Muhoroni, with 40,500 tons; and Miwani, which has a daily
capacity of 1,500 tons of crushed sugar, according to the
website of South Africa’s Sugartech.  Kenya expects to produce 550,000 tons of sugar this year,
the Kenya Sugar Board said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
