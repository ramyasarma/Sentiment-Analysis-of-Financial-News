Canadian factory sales rose four
times faster than economists  forecast  in August, led by
automobile plants that resumed production after shutdowns the
prior month.  Sales rose 2 percent to C$45.1 billion ($44.6 billion), the
most since June 2009, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa.
The gain exceeded all 13 estimates of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey that had a median forecast of 0.5 percent.  Motor vehicle sales jumped 14 percent in August to C$4
billion, while petroleum and coal rose 2.4 percent to C$5.37
billion. Excluding automobiles and parts, sales rose 1.1
percent.  Purchases may weaken in coming months after the Canadian
dollar returned to parity with the U.S. dollar yesterday for the
first time since April, making Canadian goods more expensive
abroad. The Bank of Canada will probably keep its  benchmark
lending rate  unchanged at 1 percent Oct. 19 after three prior
increases, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Longer term, you are probably going to see some downward
pressure on manufacturing,” said  Robert Kavcic , a Bank of
Montreal economist in Toronto, citing the currency and signs of
a fading U.S. recovery.  The Canadian dollar fell 0.7 percent to C$1.0107 per U.S.
dollar at 10:08 a.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0041 yesterday, when
it touched 99.81 U.S. cents per Canadian dollar, the strongest
since April 26. One Canadian dollar buys 98.98 U.S. cents.  15 of 21 Categories  Sales rose in 15 of  21 categories  tracked by Statistics
Canada, accounting for 82 percent of the total.  “Near term it’s a positive for the domestic economy,”
suggesting output grew in August after shrinking in July,  Nathan Janzen , an economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto. The
August gross domestic product report is due Oct. 29.  New factory orders rose 5.3 percent to C$45.9 billion, and
unfilled orders increased 1.5 percent to C$54.7 billion.  Inventories rose 1.3 percent to C$60 billion. The ratio of
inventories to sales, a measure of how many months it would take
to deplete stockpiles, fell to 1.33 in August from a revised
1.34 in July.  Statistics Canada revised its estimate of July’s factory
sales decline to 1.1 percent from an initially reported 0.9
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
