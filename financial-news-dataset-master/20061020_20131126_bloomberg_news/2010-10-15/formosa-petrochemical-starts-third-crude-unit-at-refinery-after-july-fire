Formosa Petrochemical Corp. ,
Taiwan’s only publicly traded oil refiner, has started all its
three crude units in Mailiao after shutting them in July because
of a fire.  The third crude distillation unit resumed production
yesterday,  Lin Keh-yen , a company spokesman, said by phone in
Taipei today. The refiner expects to process 430,000 barrels of
crude today, he said.  Formosa Petrochemical’s Mailiao refinery has three crude
distillation units, each able to process 180,000 barrels a day.
The company shut the 540,000 barrel-a-day plant for safety
reasons after an oil leak triggered a fire at its No. 2 residue
desulfurization unit on July 25.  The refiner has completed repairs of its No. 1 ethylene
plant and awaits government approval to start the unit, Lin said.  Formosa Petrochemical  has three naphtha-processing  plants 
with a combined annual capacity of 2.935 million metric tons of
ethylene, a raw material for plastics, chemicals and synthetic
fibers. The No. 1 plant, able to produce 700,000 tons of
ethylene a year, has been closed after a blaze on July 7.  Crude distillation units heat the fuel and separate it into
oil products. Residue desulfurization units remove sulfur from
residual fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
