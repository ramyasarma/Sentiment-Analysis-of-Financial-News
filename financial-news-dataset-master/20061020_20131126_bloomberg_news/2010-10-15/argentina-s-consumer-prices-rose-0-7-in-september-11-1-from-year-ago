Argentina’s  consumer prices  rose 0.7
percent in September from a month earlier, led by higher leisure
and education costs.  Consumer prices  rose  11.1 percent from a year ago, the
national statistics institute reported today in Buenos Aires.
Wholesale prices rose 0.9 from August and 15.1 percent from a
year earlier, according to the institute.  Private economists and politicians including Vice President
 Julio Cobos  and former Economy Minister  Roberto Lavagna  have
questioned the government’S data, saying officials have been
underreporting price increases since January 2007, when former
President  Nestor Kirchner  made personnel changes at the
statistics institute. The government said the changes were
intended to improve operations.  Inflation figures are less than half the estimates of
private research companies such as Buenos Aires-based Ecolatina,
which estimated that prices rose 1.6 percent from August and
24.7 percent from September last year. Prices will rise faster
in the fourth quarter of the year, fueled by an increase in
government payments of cash handouts and pensions, Ecolatina
said. Inflation will run as fast as 27 percent by year end, the
company said.  Argentines see prices rising 30 percent over the next 12
months, more than the 25 percent increase they expected in the
previous five months, according to a poll by Buenos Aires-based
Torcuato Di Tella University released yesterday.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 3.9545 per dollar today.
It has declined 3.9 percent against the dollar this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
