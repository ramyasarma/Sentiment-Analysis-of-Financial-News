At least 10 more of the men rescued
from an underground mine in Chile’s Atacama Desert are preparing
to leave the hospital today after recovering from their two-
month ordeal, a medical official said.  The first three of the 33 miners were released from Copiapo
Hospital last night, Jorge Montes, the hospital’s deputy
director, said in televised remarks today. The health of the
other miners is progressing satisfactorily, he said.  “My companions are all well,” Osman Araya, the sixth man
to emerge from the San Jose mine, said today in an interview
with state television channel TVN. “They’ve done the required
tests and are all just about ready to go home.”  The last of the 33 men was hoisted to the surface in a
four-meter long capsule on Oct. 13, capping the world’s longest
mine rescue and  sparking celebrations  throughout the country.  “I never lost hope or faith because I’m a child of God,”
Araya, 34, said of his 69-day stay half a mile underground.  More than 1 billion people watched the rescue live on
television networks around the world, TVN reported. It beat a
previous record set during a 25-day rescue of three coal workers
from a flooded mine in Guizhou, China, in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
