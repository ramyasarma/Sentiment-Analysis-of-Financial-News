Princeton University’s investments
gained 15 percent in the year ended June 30, beating Yale
University and Harvard, which gained 8.9 percent and 11 percent
respectively.  The fund was valued at $14.4 billion as of June 30, up from
$12.6 billion a year earlier, the Princeton, New Jersey, school
said today on its website.  Princeton had an average annual return of 7.9 percent in
the decade through June, beating Harvard’s 7 percent gain and
trailing Yale’s 8.9 percent gain.  Andrew Golden , Princeton’s
chief investment officer, is an acolyte of Yale’s fund chief
 David Swensen , who pioneered a strategy that invests in assets
such as private equity, real estate and commodities to beat
traditional stock and bond portfolios.  Institutional funds, including public and corporate
pensions, endowments and foundations, returned a median of 13
percent in the past year, according to Wilshire Associates, a
consulting firm in Santa Monica, California. The firm’s Trust
Universe Comparison Service tracks 1,300 funds and $3 trillion
in assets. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 12 percent in
the year ended June 30.  Yale, the New Haven, Connecticut, university with $16.7
billion, reported the worst performance among Ivy League
schools. Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the richest U.S.
school, said Sept. 9 investments at its $27.4 billion fund rose
11 percent in the past year.  The Ivy League consists of eight private schools in the
northeastern U.S. Columbia University’s $6.5 billion endowment
jumped 17 percent in the past year, while the University of
Pennsylvania’s $5.7 billion fund gained 13 percent. Dartmouth
College reported a 10 percent return for its $3 billion fund.
Cornell University said its $4.4 billion in investments rose 13
percent. Brown University’s $2.18 billion fund gained 10
percent.  None of the Ivy League schools has recouped the record
losses incurred in the year ended June 30, 2009, after the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008
crippled financial markets. As investments tumbled, universities
cut jobs, froze salaries and postponed building projects.
Princeton lost 24 percent in the year ended June 2009, mirroring
declines at Harvard and Yale.  Below is a list of endowment results for selected schools.  To contact the reporter on this story:
