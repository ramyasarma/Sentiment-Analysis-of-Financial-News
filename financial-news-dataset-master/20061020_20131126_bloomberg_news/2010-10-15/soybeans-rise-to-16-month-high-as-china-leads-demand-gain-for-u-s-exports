Soybeans jumped to the highest price
since June 2009 as reports showed rising demand from importers
including China for supplies from the U.S., the world’s largest
grower and exporter.  Shippers sold 518,803 metric tons to China and unknown
buyers for delivery before Aug. 31, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today.  Sales  in the week ended Oct. 7 rose 17
percent to 1.109 million tons from a week earlier, including 53
percent to China, the biggest consumer, the USDA said in a
separate report. Soybean prices are up 34 percent since June.  “Chinese demand continues to grow,” said  Mark Schultz ,
the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
Minneapolis. “As long as the Chinese are buying, the market is
not going to retreat very far.”  Soybean futures for January delivery advanced 6.75 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $12.0575 a bushel at 10:25 a.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, after earlier jumping to $12.145, the
highest price for a most-active contract since June 5, 2009. The
commodity surged 23 percent in the third quarter.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
