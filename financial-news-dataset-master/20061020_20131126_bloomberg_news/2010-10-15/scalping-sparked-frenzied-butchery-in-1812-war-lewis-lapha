Early in the War of 1812 between the
U.S. and Britain, Canadians enlisted North American Indians to
fight on their side.  The warriors knew how to intimidate their enemies. One
party was found “most shockingly butchered, their heads
skinned, their hearts taken out and put in their mouths, their
privates cut off and put in the places of their hearts,” wrote
a midshipman.  These tactics often spooked U.S. combatants. In one
instance, white-flagged boats filled with 115 well-armed
soldiers rowed out to a British ship on Lake Ontario in order to
surrender. Naval officer James Richardson was startled to
discover they’d just had a brief skirmish with 36 warriors.  In fact, there was brutality on both sides, and it was a
U.S. soldier who took the first scalp of the war when Captain
William McCulloch killed and mutilated a Menominee warrior on
July 25, 1812. Until then, the tribe had honored a British
request to refrain from scalping.  Enraged, they ambushed McCulloch 10 days later, when he
lost his own scalp.  I spoke with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian  Alan Taylor ,
author of “The Civil War of 1812,” on the following topics:  1. U.S. Invades Canada  2. Subject vs. Citizen  3. War Disasters  4. Scary “Savages”  5. U.S. Declares War a Success  To listen to the podcast, click  here . To buy this book in
