India’s  10-year bond yield  rose to
the highest in more than seven weeks ahead of a government
report that may show the rate of  inflation  in September held at
the same pace as the previous month.  Official data may show the  wholesale price index  rose 8.5
percent from a year earlier, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The  Reserve Bank of India  has
raised its benchmark rate five times this year to slow the
increase in prices. The central bank next meets to review
monetary policy Nov. 2.  “If inflation goes up, yields are naturally going to
rise,” said  Sanjay Arya , Mumbai-based treasurer at state-run
Bank of Maharashtra.  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose two
basis points to 8.04 percent as of 9:51 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.14, or 14 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 98.40.  India will offer 110 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) of bonds
maturing in 2015, 2020 and 2027 in an auction today. “This
slight movement may be because of the auction,” said Arya at
Bank of Maharashtra.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates, rose three basis points to 6.68
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
