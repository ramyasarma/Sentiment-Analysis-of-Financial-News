Overnight deposits with the European
Central Bank dropped to the lowest in almost a year yesterday,
suggesting banks are more comfortable to lend to each other.  Banks lodged 27.97 billion euros ($39.5 billion) in the
ECB’s overnight deposit facility at 0.25 percent, compared with
28.52 billion euros the previous day, the Frankfurt-based
central bank said in a market notice today. That’s the lowest
since Nov. 10, 2009.  “It’s a step in the right direction and shows money
markets are a bit calmer,” said  Padhraic Garvey , head of
developed market strategy at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam.
“Historically, deposits were quite low anyway because the
interest rate on it is so low, but during the crisis banks felt
safer parking the money with the ECB.”  Deposits reached a record 351 billion euros in June at the
height of Europe’s debt crisis, as banks grew more wary of
lending to each other. Greek, Irish, Spanish and Portuguese bond
spreads over German bunds have narrowed in recent weeks as
investors become more confident that governments will tackle
their budget deficits and restructure banking systems.  Excess liquidity in money markets has also declined after
the expiry of longer term ECB loans. On Sept. 30, banks had to
repay 75 billion euros in 12-month funds, 18 billion euros in
six-month funds and 132 billion euros in three-month loans. The
12- and six-month loans won’t be renewed as the ECB phases out
the non-standard measures used to fight the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
