The U.S. will open an investigation
of China’s aid to its clean-energy producers following a
complaint by the United Steelworkers union, according to two
people familiar with the decision.  Accepting the petition filed by the union last month may
lead to the U.S. filing a complaint at the World Trade
Organization over subsidies that violate global trade rules. The
people spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision
hasn’t been announced.  Illegal export credits, preferences in bidding,
restrictions on the export of minerals used in production and
discrimination against foreign firms give Chinese producers of
renewable-energy products an unfair advantage over competitors,
the union said in a complaint filed with the U.S. Trade
Representative’s office last month.  The U.S. Trade Representative’s office has a deadline of
Oct. 24 to decide if it will accept the complaint and formally
investigate the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
