Bernard Madoff ’s Palm Beach,
Florida, home sold today for $5.65 million, a third less than
its original asking price, the U.S. Marshals Service said in a
statement.  The five-bedroom, seven-bath property at 410 North Lake Way
was listed for sale in September 2009 for $8.49 million. By
August of this year, the price had been reduced to $6.5 million,
according to real estate website  Zillow.com .  The house is the last of three Madoff homes that the U.S.
government sold to pay restitution to victims of his Ponzi
scheme, the largest ever. Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence
at a federal prison in North Carolina.  “We will continue to dispose of the remaining assets with
the goal of receiving maximum gain for the victims of this
crime,” Deputy U.S. Marshal  Roland Ubaldo  said in an e-mail
today.  An auction of Madoff’s  personal property , including
jewelry, art and antiques, will be held in New York on Nov. 13,
Ubaldo said. The items include a grand piano and a diamond ring
of about 10 karats, he said.  The 8,753-square-foot (813-square-meter) Florida house was
purchased in 1994 for $3.8 million under the name of Madoff’s
wife, Ruth, according to the deed. Its appraised value was $9.4
million in 2008, Palm Beach County records show.  Madoff’s 3,000-square-foot home on Old Montauk Highway, on
the east end of New York’s Long Island, sold in October 2009 for
$9.41 million. His penthouse on Manhattan’s Upper East Side was
purchased in May for $8 million, according to property website
 StreetEasy.com .  Corcoran Group, a New York-based brokerage, marketed the
Palm Beach and Long Island homes for the Marshals Service, and
represented the buyer of the Manhattan penthouse. Buyers for all
three properties were selected by the Marshals Service. Ubaldo
declined to identify the buyer of the Palm Beach property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
