Milwaukee Brewers Hall of Fame
broadcaster Bob Uecker will undergo surgery to repair a
tear at the site of his heart valve replacement, the Major
League Baseball team announced.  Uecker, 75, who missed 10 weeks of the 2010 season
following his initial surgery, will have the procedure at
Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee on Oct. 19.  The tear is believed to have been caused by a skin-
related staph infection that he contracted six weeks after
his April 30 surgery, the team said. The infection
eventually entered Uecker’s bloodstream.  “I have the highest confidence in the doctors and
staff at Froedtert Hospital and I look forward to being
ready to go well before spring training in Arizona,”
Uecker said in a statement.  Recovery is expected to take at least eight weeks.  “Bob’s heart is stronger now following his initial
operation and therefore I think he will tolerate this
operation very well,” said James Kleczka, a cardiologist
at Froedtert. “I expect that he will need 8-10 weeks to
fully recover, after which he will be back to life as
usual.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
