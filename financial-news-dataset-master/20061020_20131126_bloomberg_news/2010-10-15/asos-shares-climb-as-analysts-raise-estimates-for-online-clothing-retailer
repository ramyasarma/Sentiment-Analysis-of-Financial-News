Asos Plc , the U.K.’s second-biggest
online clothing retailer, rose the most in more than six years
in London trading as analysts raised estimates after the company
reported a 42 percent increase in second-quarter sales.  The stock gained 168 pence, or 15 percent, to a record
1,279 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in London. The
advance was the  steepest  since March 24, 2004, and boosted the
company’s market value to 965 million pounds ($1.55 billion).  Panmure Gordon & Co. increased its estimate of second-half
retail sales growth to 40.7 percent from 33.4 percent, analyst
 Jean Roche  said in a note today. She raised her profit estimate
for the year and maintained a “buy” rating. Numis Securities,
the company’s brokerage adviser, upgraded its recommendation to
“buy” from “add” and its share-price estimate to 1,450 pence
from 1,000 pence, analyst  Andy Wade  said.  Asos said yesterday that second-quarter revenue rose to
73.8 million pounds as U.S. sales more than tripled. U.K. sales
climbed 21 percent in the quarter, slowing from the 32 percent
growth in the prior three months, though Chief Executive Officer
 Nick Robertson  said he expects improvement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
