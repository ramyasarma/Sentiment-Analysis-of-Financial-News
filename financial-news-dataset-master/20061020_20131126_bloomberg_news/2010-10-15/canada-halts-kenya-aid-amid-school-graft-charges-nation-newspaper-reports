Canada is taking a “slight pause”
in bilateral aid programs for Kenya to await the conclusion of
an investigation into allegations funds were embezzled from the
country’s free primary schooling program, the  Daily Nation  said.  Canada “downgraded” its aid operations in the east
African nation after the donor country reconfigured its priority
list of aid recipients last year, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said, citing Canadian High Commissioner David Collins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
