Tea output in Tanzania, Africa’s
fourth-biggest grower of the leaf, may rise 6.1 percent in
2010-2011 because of expected better rainfall, the Tea Board of
Tanzania said.  Production in the 12 months through June may rise to 35,000
metric tons from 33,000 tons in 2009-10, Mathias Asenga, the
board’s director general said today by phone from the commercial
capital, Dar es Salaam.  “We expect that the weather will improve compared to last
year when we experienced a drought,” he said. “Improved rains
will boost production.”  Last season’s output surpassed the 32,000 tons produced in
2008-09, but fell below the initial forecast of 35,000 tons
after the drought cut yields, according to the board. The
2010-11 crop will further be boosted by increased planting in
the last few years, Asenga said without giving details.  Four-fifths of Tanzania’s tea is sold to foreign buyers
including South Africa, the U.K., Netherlands, Pakistan,
Germany, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and India. About half of
the country’s exports are channeled through the world’s biggest
tea auction in Mombasa, a port city in neighboring Kenya.  Tanzania’s tea exports rose 24.4 percent last season to
28,064 tons from a year earlier, Asenga said. Export revenue
from the crop climbed 59 percent to $56.97 million in 2009-10
because of higher prices and shipment volume, he said.  A campaign is under way to encourage farmers to introduce
the crop to areas bordering Kenya and to use more fertilizers,
according to the board.  Tanzania ranks behind Kenya, Malawi and Uganda in terms of
tea production in Africa, according to the  Food and Agricultural
Organization’s  website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
