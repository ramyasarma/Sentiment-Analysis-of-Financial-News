Latvian Prime Minister  Valdis Dombrovskis  offered to form a four-party governing coalition
that would control almost all the seats in parliament as he
seeks to blunt opposition to further budget cuts.  “We need to work together to overcome the economic crisis
and promote state economic growth,” Dombrovskis said last night
on Latvian  television . The coalition would adopt a set of common
principles on the economy, strengthening of the judicial system
and the fight against corruption, he said.  The plan would bring Harmony Center, which represents the
Russian minority, into government for the first time and create
a coalition with 92 of 100 seats in parliament. Latvia, which
slashed spending and raised taxes to meet the terms of a 7.5
billion-euro ($10.5 billion) bailout led by the International
Monetary Fund, plans more austerity measures in 2011 and 2012.  “Harmony Center is ready to talk with Valdis Dombrovskis
about the work that is to be done in the near future and about
the conditions for the state’s long-term development,” said
Janis Urbanovics, Harmony’s parliamentary faction leader, and
Nils Usakovs, Harmony’s chairman, in an e-mailed press release.  “We have to implement an action plan for overcoming the
economic crisis while at the same time keeping social
stability,” they said.  Dombrovskis’ Unity bloc won 33 seats in parliament,
followed by Harmony Center with 29. Current coalition member
Union of Greens and Farmers has 22 and For Fatherland eight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
