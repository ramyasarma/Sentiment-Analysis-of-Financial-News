Mexico plans to raise 150 billion
yen ($1.8 billion) from a sale of 10-year Samurai bonds on Oct.
20, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  The government told investors it will price the notes to
yield 50 basis points more than the yen swap rate, said the
person, asking not to be identified as the information is
confidential. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Nomura Securities Co., Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co. and Mizuho Securities Co. are managing the sale,
 Octavio Lara , deputy director of debt issuance for Mexico’s
finance ministry, said on Sept. 14.  Mexico last sold Samurai bonds on Dec. 11 when it raised
150 billion yen from a sale of 2.22 percent notes priced at an
80 basis-point spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Samurai bonds are yen-denominated debt sold in Japan by overseas
borrowers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
