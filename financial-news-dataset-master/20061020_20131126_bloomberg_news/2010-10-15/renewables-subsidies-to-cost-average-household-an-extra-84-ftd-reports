The amount German consumers have to
pay to subsidize renewable energy will increase by 75 percent
next year, with solar power taking the lion’s share of the
increase, Financial Times Deutschland said.  The subsidy will rise to 3.5 euro cents (5 U.S. dollar
cents) per kilowatt-hour next year from 2 cents in 2010, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.
That equates to a cost increase for an average German household
of 60 euros per year, it said.  Photovoltaic power plants account for half of the
additional costs even though they only produce 20 percent of the
electricity coming from renewable sources, the newspaper said.
Environment minister  Norbert Roettgen  said the economic value of
renewable energy exceeds its costs by far, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
