The U.K. is examining whether to
give a regulator the power to cap interest rates on credit and
store cards as part of “fairer” consumer practices.  Opening a public consultation today, Consumer Minister  Ed Davey  said the government wants to tackle “unfair bank
charges” and introduce a seven-day cooling off period for store
cards.  Another option is requiring credit-card providers to make
electronic statements available so consumers can judge whether
an alternative card would provide better value for money, the
business department said in an e-mailed statement. The
insolvency regime will be reviewed to see if it “can be made to
work better.”  “Well-informed, empowered consumers are central to our
vision for how a credit market between customers and lenders
should work,” Davey said. “I want to encourage both to take
responsible decisions and to strengthen protection where
necessary, particularly for the most vulnerable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
