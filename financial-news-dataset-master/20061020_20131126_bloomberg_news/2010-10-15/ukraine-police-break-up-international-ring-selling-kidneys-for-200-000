Ukrainian police detained three
doctors on suspicion of selling the kidneys of human trafficking
victims for as much as $200,000, the Interior Ministry said.  The doctors, arrested in the capital city, Kiev, were part
of an international ring that sold the kidneys of more than 30
people from Ukraine, Moldova and Uzbekistan, the ministry said
today in a  statement  on its website.  The organs were sold for $100,000 to $200,000 each to
“wealthy citizens of a foreign country where many Ukrainians
immigrated in the beginning of 1990s,” the ministry said.  The doctors allegedly used the proceeds to buy cars, $1
million of real estate and spend holidays at luxury resorts
abroad, according to the statement. If convicted, the doctors
face as much as 12 years in prison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
