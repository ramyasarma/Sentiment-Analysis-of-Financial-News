The yuan rose to the strongest level
since 1993 on speculation American lawmakers will step up calls
for faster appreciation after the U.S. yesterday said its  trade
deficit  with China widened to a record $28 billion in August.  The People’s Bank of China set today’s reference rate for
yuan trading at 6.6497 per dollar, the highest since a dollar
peg was ended in July 2005, and the currency completed a sixth
weekly advance. A twice-annual report by the U.S. Treasury
Department about whether China manipulates its exchange rate is
due today.  “The political pressure is quite strong,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in
Sydney. “It makes both economic and strategic sense for China
to allow a strong currency.”  The yuan rose 0.14 percent to 6.6412 as of 5:30 p.m. in
Shanghai, completing a 0.44 percent advance for the week,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched
6.6404, the strongest level since the central bank unified
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  China will continue to push forward the reform of the
nation’s currency, central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan  wrote  in
an article published on the China Finance magazine’s website
today.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner renewed his
call for China to let its currency rise in a speech last week to
the International Monetary Fund. The currency has risen 2.8
percent since June 19, when the central bank said it would
pursue a more flexible exchange rate after blocking appreciation
for almost two years.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.4300 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency will
strengthen 3.3 percent from the spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Callow predicted the contracts will signal a 6 percent
appreciation by the end of this year.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  James Regan ,  Andrew Janes   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
