New Jersey , the second-wealthiest
U.S. state by per-capita income, took in 4.5 percent more in
income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 than was
projected, Treasurer  Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff  said.  The $1.9 billion collected offset a $52 million lag in
sales-tax receipts from July 1 through Sept. 30, Sidamon-Eristoff
said in a statement today. The increase helped New Jersey finish
the quarter with almost exactly the $5.9 billion in total tax
revenue needed to support the $29.4 billion budget Governor
 Chris Christie  adopted in June.  For September, income-tax collections were $83 million, or
9 percent ahead of projections, and business taxes exceeded
budget estimates by 23 percent, or $61 million, according to the
report.  “While encouraging, one month of rising revenue doesn’t
equal a trend,” Sidamon-Eristoff said in a statement announcing
the revenue results. “The struggle to recover from recession is
only beginning, and the need for fiscal restraint remains
critical.”  New Jersey ranked second behind Connecticut with $50,919 in
per-capita income in 2008, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Connecticut’s per-capita income was $56,248.  To contact the reporter on this story:
