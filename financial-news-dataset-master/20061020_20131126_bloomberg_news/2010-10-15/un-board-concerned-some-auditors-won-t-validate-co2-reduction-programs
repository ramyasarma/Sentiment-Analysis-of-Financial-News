The executive board of the Clean
Development Mechanism, the world’s second-largest carbon market,
is “concerned” that some audit firms are unwilling to validate
programs in developing nations that cut greenhouse gases.  The board wants investors to start so-called programs of
activities that cut emissions on a larger scale than single
projects. It asked a group of audit firms known as the co-
ordination forum to provide feedback at a board meeting in
Cancun, Mexico planned for the five days through Nov. 26,
according to a  report on the website  of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
