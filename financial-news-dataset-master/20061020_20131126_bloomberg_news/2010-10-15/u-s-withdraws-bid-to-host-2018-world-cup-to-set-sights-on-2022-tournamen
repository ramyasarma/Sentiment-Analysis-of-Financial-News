The U.S. withdrew its bid to host
the 2018 soccer World Cup and will focus on landing it in 2022.  The decision leaves four European groups -- England, Russia
and combined bids from Belgium/Netherlands and Spain/Portugal --
in the running for 2018.  The USA Bid Committee said in a  news release  that it took
the action after several months of discussions with soccer’s
world and European governing bodies.  “For some time we have been in conversations with FIFA and
UEFA about the possibility of focusing only on the 2022 bidding
process, an option we have made reference to many times,”  Sunil Gulati , chairman of the USA Bid Committee and president of U.S.
Soccer, said in a statement. “We are confident this is in the
best interests of the USA bid.”  World Cup rules dictate that the event, which is held every
four years, cannot be hosted on the same continent in successive
occasions. Official bids to host the World Cup in 2018 and 2022
were originally submitted in May. FIFA, based in Zurich,
Switzerland, will name the sites for both tournaments in
December.  Australia, which withdrew its bid to host the 2018 edition
in June, joins Japan, South Korea, Qatar and the U.S. as
hopefuls for 2022.  “We have had an open and constructive dialog with the USA
bid for some time now, after it became apparent that there was a
growing movement to stage the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Europe,”
FIFA Secretary General  Jerome Valcke  said. “The announcement of
today by the USA bid to focus solely on the 2022 FIFA World Cup
is therefore a welcome gesture which is much appreciated.”  The U.S. staged the World Cup in 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
