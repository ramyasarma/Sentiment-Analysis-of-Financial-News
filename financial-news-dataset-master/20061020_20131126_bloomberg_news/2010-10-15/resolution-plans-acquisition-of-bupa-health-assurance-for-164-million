Resolution Ltd. , the insurance
buyout firm founded by  Clive Cowdery , plans to buy Bupa Health
Assurance Ltd., its third and smallest acquisition to date.  Resolution will pay 102 million pounds ($164 million) for
the health insurer, the Guernsey, Channel Islands-based firm
said today in a statement. It will fund the deal with existing
capital from its Friends Provident division.  Bupa will add a variety of new products to Friends
Provident including life insurance, income protection and
critical illness cover for companies, Resolution said. Friends
Provident, bought for 1.9 billion pounds last year, currently
sells pensions to companies and income protection for
individuals.  “This transaction is entirely consistent with
Resolution’s strategy,” Resolution Chairman  Michael Biggs 
said in the statement. “It will also enhance Friends’
proposition as a focused and disciplined writer of new business
in key product areas.”  Resolution will pay 165.2 million pounds in cash for Bupa
Health and redeem about 63 million pounds immediately from the
company’s reserves, the buyout firm said. The price represents
about 62 percent of Bupa Health’s embedded value, a measure of
future profits from existing policies.  Resolution, founded by Cowdery in 2008, acquired Friends
Provident for 65 percent of its embedded value. The firm
announced its intention to buy Axa SA’s U.K. life insurance
operations for 2.75 billion pounds, or 79.8 percent of its
embedded value, in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
