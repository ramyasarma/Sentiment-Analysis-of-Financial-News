Hargreaves Lansdown Plc , the
U.K.’s biggest retail broker, said funds under management grew
14 percent in its fiscal first quarter as equity markets rose.  Assets under management climbed to 19.9 billion pounds
($32 billion) at Sept. 30 from 17.5 billion pounds on June 30,
the Bristol-based company said today in a statement. Operating
revenue climbed 25 percent to 45.2 million pounds. The company
didn’t provide a profit figure.  “The rise in stock markets during the first quarter has
helped increase the value of assets under administration,”
Chief Executive Officer  Ian Gorham  said in the statement. “Both
the rising stock markets and net new business have helped to
drive up operating revenue.”  The  FTSE All-Share Index , which is made up of U.K.
publicly listed firms, gained 13 percent in the period as
investors were reassured over government assistance for troubled
European economies including Ireland and Greece. Hargreaves
Lansdown earns fees through its online fund supermarket and
pension products.  Peter Hargreaves , who founded the company with  Stephen Lansdown  in 1981, stepped down as CEO last month and was
replaced by Gorham. Hargreaves became an executive director,
replacing Lansdown, who was named a non-executive director.  To contact the reporter on this story:
