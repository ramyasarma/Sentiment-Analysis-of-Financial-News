Bank of England markets director
 Paul Fisher  said the bank’s bond-purchase plan has been
“extremely successful” and will keep providing support to the
economy in the medium term.  “The asset-purchase program was extremely successful in
meeting its immediate objectives,” he said in a speech issued
by the bank in London today. “The bulk of the medium-term
impact from the asset purchases should come from the stock of
purchases, not the flow.”  The remarks come as policy makers debate the need to
increase the size of the plan from the current limit of 200
billion pounds ($321 billion) to aid the recovery. Monetary
Policy Committee member Adam Posen has argued the economy may
need further stimulus, while his colleague Andrew Sentance says
the bank must raise the key  interest rate  from a record low to
tame inflation pressures.  Fisher said the 200 billion pounds of stimulus will remain
“in the system until the MPC decides to withdraw it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
