Canadian Industry Minister  Tony Clement  said today that while he has heard “rumors” of other
companies seeking to acquire Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.
besides BHP Billiton Ltd., he hasn’t spoken to any other
potential bidders.  “There are no other bidders,” Clement told reporters in
Toronto. “There’s rumors of bidders, but no one has formally”
bid for  Potash Corp .  Potash Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Bill Doyle  said this
week the company is evaluating “several” alternatives to BHP’s
bid. China’s Sinochem Group has dropped plans to present a bid
to rival BHP’s, Reuters reported today.  BHP  in August offered
$40 billion to buy the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based fertilizer
producer.  Any bid for Potash must provide net benefits to Canada and
the government is considering all points of view, including that
of the Saskatchewan government, Clement also said.  “We’re doing a very wide review,” Clement said.  Clement said the new deadline for reviewing BHP’s bid under
the Investment Canada Act is Nov. 3. The minister extended the
original 45 days review by 30 days earlier this month. He said
any examination of an acquisition includes a national security
review as a “matter of course.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
