Copper gained, erasing early losses,
advancing toward a 27-month high as the outlook for demand
improved. Lead and nickel also climbed.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.3 percent to $8,425 a metric ton and
traded at $8,418.75 at 11:34 a.m. in Singapore. Copper is
heading for a fifth weekly gain, the longest advance since the
five weeks ended Dec. 4, as the dollar’s decline boosted demand
for commodities as alternative investments.  The metal, used in construction and household appliances,
has increased 1.3 percent this week as the  dollar  lost 0.8
percent against a basket of six major currencies. Prices reached
$8,490 a ton yesterday, the highest level since July 2008.  “The combination of lower copper-exchange inventories,
robust demand largely driven by emerging-market urbanization and
a constrained copper-supply outlook will sustain copper deficits
large enough to mostly deplete exchange inventories by the end
of 2011,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by  Allison Nathan  and  Jeffrey Currie  wrote in a note e-mailed today. Global
 inventories  have dropped 26 percent to near their lowest level
in a year.  The December-delivery contract on the Comex in New York
gained as much as 0.5 percent to $3.835 a pound, after reaching
a 27-month high of $3.8675 a pound yesterday. Copper for January
delivery in Shanghai pared losses of as much as 1.3 percent to
trade 0.3 percent lower at 63,680 yuan ($9,580) a ton.  China’s September exports were the second-highest on record
at $145 billion, a customs report showed this week, alleviating
concerns that a slowdown in the rest of the world will weigh on
growth in the largest metals user. The country’s foreign direct
investment increased in September, the Ministry of Commerce said
today, underscoring confidence in the country’s outlook.  Dollar Weakness  The “strong” performance of commodities in recent weeks
has been “commonly linked to the rising likelihood of a new
round of quantitative easing in the United States and an
associated weakening in the U.S. dollar,” Goldman said.  The dollar rebounded today, rising for the first time in
four days against the euro, as global stocks fell, boosting
demand for the U.S. currency as a refuge. Asian equities
retreated after U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly increased.  “The rising prospect of quantitative easing has helped
diminish the market’s concerns about the potential for sharp
macroeconomic deterioration, pushing commodity market
fundamentals back into the foreground,” Goldman said.  Aluminum was little changed at $2,411 a ton, zinc gained
0.6 percent to $2,428 a ton, lead rose 0.4 percent to $2,420 a
ton and nickel gained 0.6 percent to $24,450 a ton. Tin dropped
0.5 percent to $26,805 a ton, after rising to a record
$27,338.50 a ton yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
