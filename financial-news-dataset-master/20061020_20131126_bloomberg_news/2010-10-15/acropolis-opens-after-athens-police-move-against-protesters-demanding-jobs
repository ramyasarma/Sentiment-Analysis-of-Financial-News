The Acropolis opened to tourists
today after police cleared protesting Culture Ministry workers
from the entrance and Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said the
protests had tarnished Greece’s image.  Access to the 2,500 year-old Parthenon Temple, the
country’s best known monument, was blocked by contract workers
who were demanding permanent positions at the ministry. There
were clashes with riot police yesterday after workers locked the
gates of the archaeological site.  “These workers, whose problems we have solved, padlocked
the entrance to the site, obstructing other workers from doing
their jobs,” Papandreou said in parliament today. The Culture
Ministry said temporary workers’ wages have been paid, according
to an e-mailed statement sent yesterday.  The protests started when the 2011 draft budget, presented
on Oct. 4, included 9.2 billion euros ($12.7 billion) of
deficit-reduction measures, equivalent to 4 percent of gross
domestic product. Cuts in state employees’ wages and allowances
were extended. The budget forecasts an increase in unemployment
to 14.5 percent, the highest in more than a decade, from 9.5
percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
