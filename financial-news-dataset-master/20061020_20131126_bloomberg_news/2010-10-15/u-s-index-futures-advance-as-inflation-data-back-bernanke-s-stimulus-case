U.S. stock futures rose, indicating
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will recover from yesterday’s
drop, after lower-than-estimated inflation bolstered Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s case that more monetary
stimulus may be needed to safeguard the economy.  S&P 500  futures expiring in December rose 0.5 percent to
1,179.20 at 8:32 a.m. in New York. Dow Jones Industrial Average
contracts climbed 44 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,096.  “There would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case
for further action,” Bernanke said today in the text of remarks
given at a Boston Fed conference. He said the central bank could
expand asset purchases or change the language in its statement,
while saying “nonconventional policies have costs and
limitations that must be taken into account in judging whether
and how aggressively they should be used.”  The cost of living in the U.S. rose less than forecast in
September, indicating limited consumer demand is making it
difficult for companies to raise prices. The consumer-price
index rose 0.1 percent after 0.3 percent gains in the prior two
months, figures from the Labor Department showed today after
Bernanke’s remarks were released. Economists projected a 0.2
percent gain, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Reports also showed retail sales in the U.S. climbed
more than forecast in September while manufacturing in the New
York region expanded in October at a faster pace than
anticipated.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
