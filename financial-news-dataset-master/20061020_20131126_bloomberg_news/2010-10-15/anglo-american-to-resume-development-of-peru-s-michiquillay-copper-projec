Anglo American Plc , which has nine
copper ventures in North and South America, plans to resume
development of the Michiquillay project in Peru following a
year-long delay after securing an agreement with local groups.  “We have recently received a letter from the community
encouraging the restart of our exploration activity,”  James Wyatt-Tilby , spokesman for London-based Anglo, said today in an
e-mailed response to questions. “Drilling was suspended in late
2009 while we continued discussions with the local community.”  Anglo American, which paid $403 million for the rights to
develop the Michiquillay project in 2007, said the mine has a
potential to produce as much as 300,000 metric tons of copper a
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
