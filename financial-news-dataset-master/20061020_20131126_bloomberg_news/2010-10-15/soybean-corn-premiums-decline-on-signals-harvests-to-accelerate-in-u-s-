Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans this month fell on
bets that warm, dry weather this weekend will accelerate
harvesting, spurring more sales by farmers.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
October dropped to 52 cents to 58 cents a bushel above November
futures, compared with 54 cents to 58 cents yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Corn premiums declined to
49 cents to 51 cents above December futures from 51 cents to 53
cents.  “Premiums slipped ahead of what should be a very active
harvest weekend,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm-market adviser at
Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville, Illinois. “As
harvesting winds down toward completion, this is the time of the
year when storage fills, and the remainder is sold to
elevators.”  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 3.5 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $11.85 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price rose 4.4 percent this week.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 4.25 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $5.63 a bushel. The price gained 6.6 percent
this week.  About 51 percent of the corn crop was harvested as of Oct.
10, up from 37 percent a week earlier and the previous five-year
average of 30 percent, USDA said this week. About 67 percent of
the soybeans were collected, up from 37 percent a week earlier
and the average for the prior five years of 48 percent.  Corn production will total 12.664 billion bushels, down 3.8
percent from 13.16 billion projected a month ago and less than
last year’s record 13.11 billion, the USDA said on Oct. 8. The
soybean crop was projected at a record 3.408 billion bushels,
compared with 3.483 billion forecast in September and 3.359
billion gathered last year.  “Corn and soybean supplies are moving quickly to the
Gulf,” Marshall said. “As harvest nears completion, it will be
extremely difficult to pry loose supplies from farmer bins.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
