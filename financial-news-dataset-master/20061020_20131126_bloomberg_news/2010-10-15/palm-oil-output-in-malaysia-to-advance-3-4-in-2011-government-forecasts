Palm oil output  in Malaysia, the
second-largest producer, may climb 3.4 percent to 18.4 million
metric tons next year, according to a government forecast.  The gain will come from higher yields as oil palms mature,
especially in the eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak, the
Ministry of Finance said today in its Economic Report for
2010/2011. Production this year may rise 1.3 percent to 17.8
million tons, the report said.  The gain will help Malaysia take advantage of higher demand
for the edible oil from China and India, the two largest users.
The industry will “play a major role in propelling Malaysia
toward high-income status, with foreign-exchange earnings more
than doubling to 100 billion ringgit in 2020,” the report said.  Malaysia’s palm oil exports may reach 65.2 billion ringgit
this year compared with 49.5 billion ringgit in 2009, state news
agency Bernama said on Oct. 12, citing Plantation Industries and
Commodities Minister  Bernard Dompok .  Palm oil on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the industry
benchmark, may average 2,500 ringgit ($811) a ton this year, the
report said. That’s in line with the average this year to
yesterday’s close of 2,545 ringgit, according to Bloomberg data.  Rubber production may advance 8.5 percent to 1.02 million
tons next year as higher prices encourage tapping and the
planted area is expanded 1 percent to 1.03 million hectares (2.5
million acres) with new plantations in Sabah and Sarawak, the
report said. Malaysia is the third-largest rubber producer.  Output will rise 9.7 percent to 940,000 tons this year,
with production “expected to moderate in the second half of
2010 as tapping will be affected by wet weather,” it said.  Rubber futures climbed to a 27-month high yesterday,
touching 342.4 yen per kilogram ($4,212 a ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. Futures in Shanghai surged to a record on
speculation that economic growth in China, the largest rubber
consumer, will boost demand for the commodity used in tires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
