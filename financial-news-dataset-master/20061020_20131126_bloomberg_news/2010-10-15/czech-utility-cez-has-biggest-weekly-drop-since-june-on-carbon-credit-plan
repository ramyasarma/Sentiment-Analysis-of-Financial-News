CEZ AS , the Czech Republic’s largest
electricity producer, fell for a fourth day and had its biggest
weekly decline since June after the government said companies
will have to pay more for carbon-dioxide emissions.  The state-run utility  declined  0.9 percent to 770 koruna,
the lowest close since April 2009 at 4:04 p.m. in Prague. The
stock tumbled 5.6 percent this week, the most since the five
days ending June 25. Almost 1.3 million shares changed hands
today, or 2.5 times the daily average of the past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
