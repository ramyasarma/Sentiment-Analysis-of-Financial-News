China’s rising grain imports are
adding to a jump in the cost of food, said  Rob Subbaraman , an
analyst at Nomura International, in a research note today.  While Russia’s ban on wheat exports following a drought in
the country is often singled out as the cause for the recent
surge in global  food prices , China’s grain buying is another
reason, Subbaraman said.  Chinese cereal imports climbed to 1 million metric tons in
September, more than three times the amount a year earlier,
according to the Nomura report.  “China is already a massive global importer of soybeans
and looks like it may be heading in that direction for grain,”
Subbaraman said. “Demand for food in countries like China is
grossly underestimated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
