Britain’s antitrust regulator said
it will prevent developers of shopping centers and office
buildings from using restrictive rental contracts beginning in
April 2011, when an exemption to competition law expires.  The  Office of Fair Trading  will target some agreements that
entice flagship retailers to a property by promising to block
competitors from opening nearby, the London-based watchdog said
today in a statement. Restrictions will still be permitted if
developers can prove they are needed for a limited time.  The change, which follows legislation passed in June,
“will remove barriers to new businesses and open up competition
in local areas for the benefit of consumers,” Cavendish
Elithorn, an OFT director, said in the  statement .  The change stems from a 2008 probe of the control of land
by large grocery retailers in concentrated areas conducted by
another regulator, the Competition Commission, the OFT said.  The change will bring the U.K. in line with laws in most
other countries, said Marjorie Holmes, a competition lawyer with
Reed Smith LLP in London.  Ending the exemption will “help small businesses that are
not powerful enough to dictate a restriction,” while still
allowing “a proper reward for investing,” Holmes said today in
a phone interview.  The U.K. government said yesterday that the OFT and
Competition Commission will be merged to save costs. The
government will hold consultations next year on the
merger, with the OFT’s consumer and enforcement functions
transferred elsewhere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
