Poland is selling shares at 36 to 43
zloty each in an initial public offering of the Warsaw Stock
Exchange, according to terms of the sale obtained by Bloomberg
News.  The government, which is offering a 64 percent stake of the
country’s sole stock exchange, yesterday set the maximum price
for individual investors at 43 zloty a share, valuing the sale
at as much as 1.15 billion zloty ($415 million). Bookbuilding
for institutional investors is starting today and ending on Oct.
28, based on a prospectus published yesterday.  The IPO is part of a government plan to raise 25 billion
zloty this year to help finance the budget gap and curb
borrowing. Poland has sold stakes in the nation’s biggest
insurance, energy, copper and phone companies this year.  The Warsaw bourse is set to be the first bourse operator in
emerging Europe to go public.  To contact the reporters on this story:
