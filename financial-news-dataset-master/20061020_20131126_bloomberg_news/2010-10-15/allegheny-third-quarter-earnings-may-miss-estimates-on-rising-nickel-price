Allegheny Technologies Inc. , a U.S.
specialty-metals producer, said it will report adjusted third-
quarter earnings of about 26 cents a share, less than analysts
projected, because of an “unexpected” rise in nickel prices.  The  average estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for per-share profit of 29 cents. Earnings, excluding a
pretax inventory charge of 21 cents a share and a 4-cent tax
charge, will be 1 cent a share, the Pittsburgh-based company
said today in a statement.  Net income  a year earlier was 1 cent
a share.  The inventory charge of $33 million “is primarily the
result of the recent significant and unexpected increase in the
cost of nickel,” the company said in the statement.  Allegheny uses nickel in alloys made to withstand high
temperatures and high stress for  industries  such as aerospace,
electrical energy and automotive. Nickel for delivery in three
months averaged 21 percent higher in the third quarter compared
with a year earlier on the London Metal Exchange.  Allegheny fell 66 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $47.91 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have  risen  7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
