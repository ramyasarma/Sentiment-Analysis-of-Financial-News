India’s stocks fell, led by  Infosys
Technologies Ltd.  after its earnings report and as the central
bank indicated it may intervene to limit currency gains,
prompting concern it may slow record foreign fund inflows.  Infosys, the second-largest software exporter, retreated
from its highest ever level, halting a three-day, 3.6 percent
advance. Chief Financial Officer  V. Balakrishnan  today said
rupee volatility will “kill the whole export industry.”
Smaller peer Wipro Ltd. slid the most since January.  “Exporters need a stable currency environment,” said
 Sudhakar Shanbhag , who manages $1.7 billion in assets as chief
investment officer at Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance
Ltd. in Mumbai. “The job of the central bank is very
challenging” as it needs to balance inflows, monetary
tightening and growth.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
lost 372.59, or 1.8 percent, to 20,125.05 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai, declining for the second week. The gauge this
week retreated after nearing its highest close of 20,873.33 on
Jan. 8, 2008. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock
Exchange fell 1.9 percent to 6,062.65. The  BSE 200 Index  dropped
1.7 percent to 2,558.95.  This year’s 15 percent rally makes the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s 10 biggest stock markets. Foreign
fund inflows have surged 66 percent this year, making the gauge
the most expensive in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also
include Brazil, Russia and China.  Narrower Margin  Infosys lost 3.4 percent to 3,076.3 rupees, the most since
July 13. Balakrishnan today said a stronger rupee against the
dollar hurt the company’s operating margin by 1.5 percent as it
posted a 13 percent increase in quarterly profit. For the year,
the margin may narrow by 130 basis points, he said. A basis
point is equivalent to 0.01 percentage point.  “Investors were too optimistic about Infosys,” said
 Kishor Ostwal , managing director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., a
publicly traded equities research provider in Mumbai. “A big
surprise was needed from Infosys to pull the market up as it’s
already in overbought zone. The impact of a stronger rupee will
be seen in the next quarter as the foreign inflows were huge in
September and October.”  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. , the largest software
services exporter, fell 3.6 percent to 950.3 rupees. Wipro lost
3.5 percent to 473.45 rupees, its steepest drop since Jan. 29.  The rupee has gained 5.2 percent in the past 30 days.
Global investors have poured a record 1.07 trillion rupees
($24.2 billion) into the country’s stocks this year so far, and
$10 billion into local-currency debt, to profit from an economy
 growing  at an annual pace exceeding 8 percent.  ‘Balancing Act’  Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said today that the Reserve Bank
of India may intervene “if inflows are lumpy and volatile” and
disrupt the economy.  “It comes down to a balancing act between making sure
there’s enough money to finance your current-account deficit,
but at the same time not do any serious damage to people whose
competitiveness is undermined for no fault of their own,”
central bank Deputy Governor  Subir Gokarn  said yesterday.  Overseas  investors  bought a net  28.9 billion rupees  of
Indian equities on Oct. 14, according to the nation’s market
regulator. The funds have been net buyers of the stocks for 32
trading days, the longest run of inflows in more than five years
since the 40-days period ended Aug. 9, 2005, Bloomberg data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
