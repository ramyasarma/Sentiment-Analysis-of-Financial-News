The U.S. Treasury Department said it
will delay a report on international currencies, including
China’s, while citing progress in the acceleration of the pace
of the yuan’s rise. A statement from the Treasury said the
report will be delayed until after meetings of the Group of 20
nations in the coming weeks. In the statement, Treasury
Secretary Timothy F. Geithner “recognized China’s actions since
early September to accelerate the pace of currency appreciation,
while noting it is important to sustain this course.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
