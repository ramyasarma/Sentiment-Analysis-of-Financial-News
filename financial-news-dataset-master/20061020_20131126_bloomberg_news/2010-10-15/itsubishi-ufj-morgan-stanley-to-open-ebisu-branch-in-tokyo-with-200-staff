Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co.  said it will open two retail brokerage branches
in Tokyo’s Ebisu and Akihabara districts this year and close 12
outlets as it consolidates locations.  The firm will start the 200-staffed branch at  Yebisu Garden
Place , the location of Morgan Stanley’s Tokyo office, in
December, and open the Akihabara outlet with 100 employees in
November, said  Susumu Taroura , a Tokyo-based spokesman.  Morgan Stanley  and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
Japan’s largest bank, started two joint ventures in May for
brokerage services and investment banking, and for trading
business. Mitsubishi UFJ invested $9 billion in the Wall Street
firm in 2008 amid the global credit crisis.  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley  plans to consolidate its
retail branches to 77 from 102 within three years, Taroura said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
