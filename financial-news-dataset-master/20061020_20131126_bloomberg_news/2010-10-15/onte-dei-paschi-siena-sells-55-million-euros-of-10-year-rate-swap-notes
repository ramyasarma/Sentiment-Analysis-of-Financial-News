Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA,
the world’s oldest bank, sold 54.5 million euros ($76.7 million)
of 10-year notes linked to euro interest-rate swaps.  The securities for the Siena, Italy-based bank pay a coupon
of 100 basis points more than the 10-year constant-maturity swap
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes are
underwritten by Nomura Holdings Inc. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The euro 10-year swap rate, the cost of exchanging fixed
interest payments for floating rates, is 2.64 percent. The level
dropped to 2.27 percent on Aug. 30, the lowest since the euro’s
start in 1999.  Structured notes are bank-issued securities that combine
bonds with derivatives, which are contracts whose value is
derived from stocks, interest rates, currencies or commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
