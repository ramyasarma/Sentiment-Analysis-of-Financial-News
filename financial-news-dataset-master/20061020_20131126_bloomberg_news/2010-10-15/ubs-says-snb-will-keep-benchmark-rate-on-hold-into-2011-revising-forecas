UBS AG said it no longer expects the
Swiss central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate before
the first quarter of 2011 as global central banks prepare to
embark on further quantitative easing.  The Swiss National Bank will probably raise its main
lending rate by 25 basis points from 0.25 percent in the first
quarter of 2011 “with further tightening steps of 25 basis
points each following in the three quarters thereafter,” UBS
economist Reto Huenerwadel said in an e-mailed statement today.
UBS previously forecast the SNB to start raising borrowing costs
in the fourth quarter of 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
