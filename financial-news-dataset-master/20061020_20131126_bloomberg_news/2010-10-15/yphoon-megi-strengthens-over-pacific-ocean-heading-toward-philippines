Typhoon Megi strengthened as it
headed across the Pacific Ocean toward the Philippines, the U.S.
Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center said.  Megi was about 1,740 kilometers (1,080 miles) east of
Manila at 8 a.m. local time today, the center said on its
 website . The storm was moving west-northwest at 15 kilometers
per hour and is forecast to reach Luzon, the country’s most
populous island, within four days.  The storm’s maximum sustained winds increased to 167 kph
from 148 kph and may strengthen to 241 kph before making
landfall northeast of the capital, the center said. That would
make it a Category 4 storm, the second-strongest, on the  Saffir-
Simpson  Hurricane Wind scale.  Waves in the vicinity of the storm’s eye were 7.6 meters
(25 feet) high.  Megi is the name of a catfish in South Korea and is related
to the feeling of getting wet, according to the Hong Kong
Observatory, which lists names assigned to storms in the
northwest Pacific. Megi is the 15th storm of the season.  Typhoon Conson left 102 people dead in the Philippines in
July and destroyed or damaged more than 70,000 homes, the
National Disaster Coordinating Council  said  in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
