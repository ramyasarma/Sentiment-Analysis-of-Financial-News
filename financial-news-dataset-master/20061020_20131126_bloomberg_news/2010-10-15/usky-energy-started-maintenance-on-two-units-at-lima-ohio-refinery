Husky Energy Inc. started
maintenance on a fluid catalytic cracker and coking unit at its
Lima, Ohio, refinery.  “These units comprise approximately 30 percent of the
refinery’s operations,” said  Graham White , a company spokesman,
in an e-mail statement. “The rest of the refinery is up and
running throughout the maintenance” and will produce at about
70 percent of typical rates, he said.  The refinery manufactures 25 percent of the gasoline used
in Ohio, along with 30,000 barrels a day of diesel and 25,000
barrels of jet fuel, plus residual fuels and petrochemical
feedstocks, according to the company’s  website .  The work on the units is expected to take about 40 days,
White said.  About 80 percent of the crude processed at the refinery is
domestic, with additional supplies from the North Sea and West
Africa. The 170,000-barrel-a-day plant “processes almost
exclusively light crude,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
