The University of Southern
California received two gifts, totaling $100 million, to fund
cancer research and construct a journalism building.  Ming Hsieh , a USC trustee, donated $50 million to endow
research into nanomedicine for cancer, while the Annenberg
Foundation gave $50 million to construct the Wallis Annenberg
Hall for training journalists in digital media, the university,
in Los Angeles, said today in two statements. The gifts were
timed to coincide with the inauguration of USC President  C.L. Max Nikias , said James Grant, a USC spokesman.  “Today is a special day for the university, and these two
donors wanted to help get the momentum of Max Nikias’s
presidency moving forward,” Grant said in a phone interview.
Nikias, who had been USC’s provost, succeeded  Steven Sample  as
president on Aug. 3.  Hsieh, who received an undergraduate degree from USC in
1983 and a master’s in electrical engineering in 1984, founded
 Cogent Inc. , a Pasadena, California-based maker of fingerprint
identification technology. He also gave $35 million to USC’s
engineering school in 2006.  Including today’s gift, the Annenberg Foundation, based in
Los Angeles, and the Annenberg family have donated a total of
$350 million to USC, the university said.  Walter Annenberg , who
died in 2002, was the publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer. He
was U.S. ambassador to the U.K. from 1968 to 1974.  USC, founded in 1880, has about 35,000 students and is the
largest private, not-for-profit university on the U.S. West
Coast. Among the students who attended USC are  Neil Armstrong ,
the first person to walk on the moon, and  John Wayne , the late
actor.  George Lucas , the movie producer and director who
graduated in 1966, donated $175 million, still the record for
USC, in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
