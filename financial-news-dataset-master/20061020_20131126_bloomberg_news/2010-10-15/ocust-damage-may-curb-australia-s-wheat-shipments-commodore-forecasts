Wheat shipments from  Australia , the
fourth-largest exporter, may be little changed this year and
miss a government forecast because a locust plague may harm the
harvest, according to Commodore Research & Consultancy.  Shipments may be 15 million to 16 million metric tons in
2010-2011 compared to about 15 million tons last marketing year,
the New York-based group said in an e-mailed report. The
Australian Bureau of Agricultural & Resource Economics-Bureau of
Rural Sciences forecast on Sept. 14 that exports may rise to
18.4 million tons, the second-highest level on record.  A miss of the government forecast may help to sustain
wheat’s 30 percent rally this year, which has been driven by  Russia ’s decision to suspend shipments after a drought. Farmers
and state authorities in Australia are to step up spraying over
the next few weeks to control an infestation forecast by the
 Australian Plague Locust Commission  to be the worst in decades.  “Some analysts have ignored locust egg hatchings and
anticipate Australian wheat exports will total as much as 18.5
million tons this year,” the report said. “We caution against
this and urge that hatchings must continue to be monitored.”  Wheat for December delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade
increased 0.5 percent to $7.0425 a bushel at 1:06 p.m. Melbourne
time. The price reached $8.68 on Aug. 6 after Russia’s ban on
shipments was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
