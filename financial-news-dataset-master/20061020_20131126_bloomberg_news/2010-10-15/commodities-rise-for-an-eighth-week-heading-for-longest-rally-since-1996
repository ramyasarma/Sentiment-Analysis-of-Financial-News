Commodities headed for an eighth
straight weekly gain, the longest streak since 1996, on
speculation that a weaker dollar will boost the appeal of
metals, grains and energy as alternative investments.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of 24 raw materials rose
0.1 percent to 570.567 points at 11:44 a.m. London time, for a
weekly advance of 1.1 percent. An eighth climb would mark the
longest winning run since the 11 weeks ended Jan. 5, 1996. The
 U.S. Dollar Index  has lost 1.1 percent this week, stoking demand
for raw materials as an alternative investment.  The dollar is slumping on speculation that the Federal
Reserve will buy more assets, known as quantitative easing, to
spur the U.S. economy. Gold and tin climbed to records yesterday
and silver rose to a 30-year high, cotton reached an all-time
high today, and corn surged 19 percent in four sessions through
Oct. 12.  “This strong performance has been commonly linked to the
rising likelihood of a new round of quantitative easing in the
United States and an associated weakening in the U.S. dollar,”
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report today. “QE2 has been
a particularly important driver of gold prices, contributing to
our increasingly constructive outlook on the metal.”  Gold, Silver  Gold for immediate delivery pared gains today after adding
2.6 percent in the prior four sessions. Bullion fell 0.2 percent
to $1,378.02 an ounce after yesterday reaching a record
$1,387.35. Futures for December delivery were little changed at
$1,378.60 on the Comex in New York after reaching an all-time
high $1,388.10 yesterday.  The  UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index  climbed
for a sixth session to 1,500.452 points after yesterday touching
1,512.3314, the highest level since Aug. 4, 2008.  Silver for immediate delivery fell 0.5 percent to $24.535
an ounce, cutting this week’s climb to 5.5 percent. Comex
futures for December delivery gained 0.4 percent to $24.54 after
yesterday touching $24.95, the highest price since March 1980.  Oil for November delivery was little changed at $82.72 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are up 3.4
percent this month. Brent crude for December settlement traded
on ICE Futures Europe in London fell to $84.02.  Corn for December delivery gained 0.8 percent to $5.7175 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The contract has climbed
8.2 percent this week after the U.S. government released a
report predicting lower production.  Soybeans for January delivery rose 0.9 percent to $12.0925
a bushel. Wheat for December delivery gained 0.8 percent to
$7.0325 a bushel.  Sugar for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to 27.87 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The contract has gained
5.9 percent this week on speculation that crops in Brazil, the
world’s largest producer of the sweetener, will be harmed by
drought that lasted through mid-September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
