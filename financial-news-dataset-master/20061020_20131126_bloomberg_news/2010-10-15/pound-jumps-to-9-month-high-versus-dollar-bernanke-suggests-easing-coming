The British pound climbed versus the
dollar after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said he sees
a case for “further action” in monetary stimulus because
inflation is too low and unemployment too high.  Sterling rose 0.5 percent to $1.6099 at 1:18 p.m. in
London, the highest since January.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
