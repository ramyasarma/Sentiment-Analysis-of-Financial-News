Brazil’s Finance Minister Guido
Mantega said the government is waiting to see if the real
stabilizes before deciding whether to take additional measures
to stem recent currency gains.  “We have to watch” to see if there is a “spontaneous
calming down” of the currency, Mantega told reporters in
Brasilia. “If not, we will take new measures.”  Mantega said dollar inflows slowed this month after
investors brought $16 billion into the country to partake in
Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s share offering in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
