Liverpool’s board is meeting today
to push through the forced sale of the English soccer club to
the operators of the Boston Red Sox baseball team after the
owners dropped a Texas case blocking the transaction, according
to three people familiar with the situation.     The independent board members are at their lawyers’ office
in London to discuss the sale to New England Sports Ventures
LLC, two of the people said. Owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett
are working with U.S.-based hedge fund Mill Financial in a bid
to repay their debt before the sale can be completed, three of
the people said.  The lifting of the order in the U.S. means the club may now
be sold to the New England group. Hicks and Gillett may retain
control of the team if they repay a 237 million-pound ($380
million) debt to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc today, the
people said. The people declined to be identified because the
talks are ongoing and aren’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
