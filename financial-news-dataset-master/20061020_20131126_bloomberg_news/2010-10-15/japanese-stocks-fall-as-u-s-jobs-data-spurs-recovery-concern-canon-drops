Japanese  benchmark stock indexes 
retreated from the biggest gains in a month yesterday after the
yen rose to a 15-year high, damping exporters’ profit outlooks.
Banks dropped after a report they will sell cross-shareholdings.  Canon Inc. , the world’s No. 1 camera maker, slid 1.3
percent. Panasonic Corp., the world’s biggest maker of plasma
televisions, slipped 1.2 percent. Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest automaker, declined 1.2 percent. Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest bank by market value, slid
2.8 percent, while Mizuho Financial Group Inc., the No. 3, sank
4.9 percent.  “Worries about the yen’s strengthening still remain,”
said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $106 billion. “A lot
of attention is on the currency’s moves.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.9 percent to 9,500.25
at the close in Tokyo. The gauge declined 0.9 percent for the
week, which was shortened by a public holiday. The broader Topix
index lost 1.3 percent to 826.38, with about 11 stocks falling
for every two that advanced. It fell 1.6 percent for the week.
Yesterday, the Nikkei climbed 1.9 percent, the most since Sept.
15, and the Topix gained the most since Sept. 6.  Canon slid 1.3 percent to 3,860 yen. Panasonic declined 1.2
percent to 1,193 yen, while  Sony Corp. , an electronics maker
that earns more than 70 percent of sales outside of Japan,
retreated 1 percent to 2,613 yen.  Toyota  declined 1.2 percent to
2,894 yen, while Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest
carmaker, slid 1.4 percent to 2,964 yen.  Yen Appreciation  The yen appreciated to as much as 80.89 against the dollar
yesterday evening in Tokyo, from 81.23 at the close of stock
trading. It was the highest level since April 1995. A stronger
yen cuts the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  The Topix has tumbled 17 percent from its high this year on
April 15 as Europe’s debt crisis, China’s steps to curb property
prices and concern about U.S. economic growth damped confidence
in a global recovery. Stocks in the index trade at 14.8 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 14 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.2 times for the  Stoxx Europe
600 Index .  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  were little changed today. The
index dropped 0.4 percent yesterday in New York as financial
companies slumped amid concern over growing legal scrutiny of
home-foreclosure practices.  A report from the U.S. Labor Department showed the number
of Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment
benefits unexpectedly increased last week. A separate report
showed wholesale costs for goods other than food and energy rose
in September for a second month at a pace that suggests limited
demand is restraining inflation.  Banks Decline  Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 2.8 percent to 385 yen, while  Mizuho 
fell 4.9 percent to 116 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc., Japan’s second-largest bank by market value, lost 2.5
percent to 2,388 yen. Banks were the biggest drag on the Topix
index among the gauge’s 33 industry groups.  Japan’s three largest banks may sell a total of 2 trillion
yen ($24.6 billion) in shareholdings over the next three years
as they prepare for stricter capital requirements in 2013,
Nikkei English News said, without citing anyone.  “The news is causing selling in financial shares,” said
 Shoichi Arisawa , an Osaka-based manager at Iwai Cosmo Holdings
Inc. “Dissolving each others’ holdings means more supply in the
market. Banks are beginning to reduce risk assets, and we may
start to see more moves like these in the future.”  Nomura Holdings Inc. , Japan’s largest brokerage, tumbled
6.2 percent to 427 yen after the Asahi newspaper said the
brokerage may delay its sale of regional lender Ashikaga
Holdings Co.  Bloomberg News on July 2 reported the bank may delay the
sale by as much as two years, citing two people with knowledge
of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
