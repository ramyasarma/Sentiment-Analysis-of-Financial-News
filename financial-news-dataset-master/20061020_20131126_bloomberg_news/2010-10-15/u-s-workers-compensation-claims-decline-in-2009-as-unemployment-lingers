Workers’ compensation claims declined
last year, extending a slide that began in 1991, as improving
job conditions and higher unemployment reduced accident
frequency, preliminary insurance-industry data show.  Claim frequency fell 4 percent in 2009 after a 3.4 percent
drop in 2008, the National Council on Compensation Insurance
Inc. said in a  statement  on its website. The claims rate dropped
in all industries and geographic regions, Boca Raton, Florida-
based NCCI said.  “Given the continued weakness of the labor market, it is
likely that claim frequency will continue to decline in 2010,”
NCCI said. “During recession, there is less job creation, which
translates into a more experienced, and thus less accident-
prone, workforce.”  The  U.S. unemployment rate  held at 9.6 percent in
September, and has been at or above 9.5 percent since August
2009. Workers’ compensation providers, a group led by Liberty
Mutual Group Inc. and  American International Group Inc ., are
lowering rates to compete in the shrinking market.  Frequency of claims has declined in 17 of 19 years since
1991, possibly because of safer technology, the aging workforce
and regulatory changes in the 1990s that made receiving workers’
compensation more difficult, according to the report.  The study is based on preliminary data for 2009. NCCI
collected data from the 37 states where it provides ratemaking
information to estimate the frequency of lost-time claims per
100,000 workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
