Oil advanced in New York after U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said additional
monetary stimulus may be warranted.  Futures erased earlier losses of as much as 0.5 percent as
the dollar weakened after Bernanke said the central bank could
expand asset purchases. Oil has gained 3.6 percent since the
beginning of the month while the  Dollar Index  declined 3.1
percent. Some investors buy commodities as a currency hedge.  “There would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a
case for further action,” Bernanke said today in the text of
remarks given at a Boston Fed conference.  Crude for November delivery rose as much as 64 cents, or
0.8 percent to $83.33 a barrel and traded at $83.08 in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of
1:33 p.m. London time.  “For now the big theme is going to be quantitative
easing,” said  Joern Quitzau , a Hamburg-based economist at
Berenberg Bank who is responsible for commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
