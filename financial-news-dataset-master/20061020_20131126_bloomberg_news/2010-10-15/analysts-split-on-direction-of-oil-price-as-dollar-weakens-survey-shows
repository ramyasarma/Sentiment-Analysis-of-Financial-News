Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
were split over whether oil prices will rise or fall next week
on speculation the dollar will extend eight-month lows against
the euro and as the Federal Reserve acts to support the economy.  Fifteen of 35 analysts, or 43 percent, forecast crude will
advance through Oct. 22. Fifteen more respondents predicted that
futures will decline. Five said there will be little change.
Last week, 52 percent of analysts expected an decrease.  The dollar fell to $1.4122 per euro yesterday, its weakest
level since Jan. 26, as U.S. initial  jobless claims  rose and the
trade deficit widened. The economic reports added to speculation
that quantitative easing by the Fed, debt purchases to bolster
the economy, will erode the value of the currency. A weak dollar
spurs commodities’ appeal as an alternate investment.  “Crude oil is basically going to follow whatever the
dollar does,” said  John Caiazzo , president of Acuvest Commodity
Brokers Inc. in Temecula, California. The market is “stable”
after an OPEC decision this week not to alter its production
targets, he said.  U.S. stockpiles of crude oil fell 416,000 barrels to 360.5
million last week, the Energy Department said yesterday. They
were forecast to rise 1.45 million barrels, based on the median
of 18 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey before the
report.  Petroleum demand  dropped 0.7 percent to 18.3 million
barrels a day, the lowest level since the week ended Nov. 27.  The crude oil futures contract for November delivery fell
$1.41, or 1.7 percent, to $81.25 a barrel this week on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are up 2.4 percent this year.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 47 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
