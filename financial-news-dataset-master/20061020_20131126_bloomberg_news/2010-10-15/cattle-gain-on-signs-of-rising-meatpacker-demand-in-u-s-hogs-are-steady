Cattle prices climbed to a three-
week high on signs of increased demand from U.S. meatpackers.
Hog futures were little changed.  Steers  for immediate delivery yesterday at slaughterhouses
were 19 percent more expensive than a year earlier at 96.51
cents a pound on average, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Meatpackers processed 516,000 head of cattle in the first
four days of this week, up 0.8 percent from a week earlier,
according to government data.  “It appears the packer wants to get some supplies around
him a little bit earlier” than normal to satisfy meat demand
during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, said  Don Roose ,
the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.
The higher cash-cattle prices are boosting futures, he said.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 1.85 cents, or
1.9 percent, to settle at $1.00125 a pound at 1:08 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1.005,
the highest level for a most-active contract since Sept. 21. The
commodity rose 1.3 percent this week and has gained 16 percent
this year.  U.S. beef and veal exports rose 20 percent in August from a
year earlier, while pork shipments fell 0.8 percent, the
government said today.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement advanced 0.675
cent, or 0.6 percent, to settle at $1.096 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for December settlement gained 0.05 cent to
settle at 68.9 cents a pound. Prices fell 6.7 percent this week,
in the biggest weekly drop since August 2009, as U.S. demand
slowed following the summer-grilling season.  The  wholesale-pork cutout , a weighted average of cuts
including bellies, ribs and hams, rose 0.2 percent yesterday to
81.25 cents a pound, the first gain in four days, according to
the USDA. The price is down 2.8 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
