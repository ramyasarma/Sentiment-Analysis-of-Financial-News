Gold fluctuated near a record in
London on concern that the metal’s advance as an alternative
investment to a weakening dollar may have been overdone.  Gold reached a record $1,387.35 an ounce yesterday as the
dollar weakened, boosting bullion holdings in exchange-traded
products to an all-time high. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will speak on monetary policy objectives and tools in
Boston today. Bullion’s rally has driven the relative strength
index above 70, a sign to some analysts and traders who study
technical charts that prices may be poised to drop.  “The dollar for the time being may go lower” and that
will support gold, said  Afshin Nabavi , a senior vice president
at bullion refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva. Still, gold “is
overbought. For the market to remain healthy we need a
correction, but any correction is an opportunity to buy.”  Immediate-delivery bullion lost $2.63, or 0.2 percent, to
$1,378.53 an ounce at 11:22 a.m. in London. Prices swung between
a gain of 0.1 percent and a loss of 0.4 percent. Gold for
December delivery was 0.1 percent higher at $1,379.30 an ounce
on the Comex in New York after yesterday reaching a record
$1,388.10.  Bullion rose to $1,377.25 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,373.25 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing. Spot
prices are up 2.4 percent this week, heading for a fifth weekly
gain.  Winning Streak  Gold, up 26 percent this year, is heading for a 10th annual
gain, the longest winning streak since at least 1920. Bullion
has outperformed global equities, Treasuries and most industrial
metals, prompting record investment in gold-backed exchange-
traded products. The metal rallied as central banks and
governments maintained low borrowing costs and spent trillions
of dollars to stimulate economies.  Speculation that the Fed may further loosen monetary policy
through so-called quantitative easing has helped to weaken the
dollar, boosting gold. On Oct. 4, Bernanke said the central
bank’s first round of large-scale asset purchases aided the
economy and further buying is likely to help more. He’s
scheduled to speak at 8:15 a.m. Boston time.  “Markets will watch for any hints on the timing and
magnitude of additional quantitative easing,” said  Stefan Graber , an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. “Expectations
have been largely priced in,” Graber wrote in a report.  The dollar yesterday slipped to an eight-month low against
the euro and the weakest level in 15 years versus the yen. Gold
usually moves inversely to the greenback, which was lower
against the yen and steady against the euro today.  Gold Survey  Gold may extend gains as real interest rates should remain
low, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That may “lend
further support” to platinum, the bank’s analysts said in a
report yesterday.  Fifteen of 19 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 79 percent, said gold will gain next week. Three
forecast lower prices and one was neutral.  Gold assets  in ETPs climbed 19.77 metric tons to a record
2,104.65 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
from 10 providers. Holdings are up 17 percent this year. Silver
assets rose 73.8 tons to 14,182.57 tons, the highest amount in
at least eight months, data compiled by Bloomberg from four
providers show.  Silver for immediate delivery in London was 0.3 percent
lower at $24.57 an ounce after yesterday reaching $24.92, the
highest level since March 1980. The metal is headed for an
eighth weekly gain, the best run since May 2006.  Platinum’s Lure  Platinum declined 0.7 percent to $1,703.75 an ounce.
Palladium lost 0.8 percent to $597.97 an ounce after yesterday
reaching $605.13, the highest price since June 2001.  Platinum and palladium are more attractive than gold in the
long term as the metals may benefit from wealth protection and
increasing industrial demand,  Commerzbank AG  analysts including
 Eugen Weinberg  said in a report today. While platinum may fall
to $1,650 and palladium may drop to $525 in the fourth quarter
on “profit-takings,” prices will climb to $1,800 and $600 at
the end of next year, respectively, the bank said.  Citigroup Inc. raised its 2011 estimate for palladium by 28
percent to $575, and increased its 2011 forecast for platinum 2
percent to $1,625, it said in a report yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
