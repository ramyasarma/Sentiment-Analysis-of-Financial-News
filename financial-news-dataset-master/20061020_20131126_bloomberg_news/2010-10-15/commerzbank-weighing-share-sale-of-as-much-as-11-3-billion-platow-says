Commerzbank AG  Chief Executive
Officer Martin Blessing is considering raising as much as 8
billion euros ($11.3 billion) in a share sale to pay back half
of the state aid the lender received,  Der Platow Brief  said.  Blessing would need to wait until next year to conduct the
capital increase, after the bank restructuring law is expected
to come into effect, the German newsletter reported, without
saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
