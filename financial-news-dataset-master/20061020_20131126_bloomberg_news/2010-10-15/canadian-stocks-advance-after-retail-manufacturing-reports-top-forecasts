Most  Canadian stocks  rose, extending
a weekly gain, as banks and energy companies advanced after data
on U.S. retail sales and manufacturing, as well as Canadian
manufacturing, surpassed economists’ forecasts.  Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest bank, increased
0.4 percent as lenders climbed. Magna International Inc.,
Canada’s biggest auto-parts maker, rose 1.9 percent after a
Deutsche Bank AG analyst raised his 12-month  price estimate  on
the company. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold
producer, fell 0.5 percent as the metal slipped from a record
high.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  advanced 10.52
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,630.21 as of 9:49 a.m. in Toronto.
For the week, the index has increased 0.8 percent.  The S&P/TSX is heading for a fifth-straight weekly gain for
the first time since April 2009. The index rallied 4.3 percent
during the streak through yesterday, led by raw-materials
companies. An index of commodities gained 9 percent as the U.S.
dollar weakened on concerns that new U.S. Federal Reserve
stimulus measures will weaken the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
