Oando Plc , a Nigerian petroleum
products company, said it will build 120 kilometers (75 miles)
of gas pipelines every 18 to 24 months as part of its plans to
develop a gas grid that will feed power plants.  “We hope to reach all parts of the country with the gas
grid in the coming years,” Yomi Awobokun, chief operating
officer of the company, said yesterday in an interview in Lagos,
the commercial hub. “We have built a network in Lagos. We are
doing the same in the east of the country, and very soon we
shall start work in the west.”  He did not say how long Oando Marketing will work on the
gas grid, which will supply electricity to industries throughout
Nigeria.  Nigeria, holder of Africa’s largest natural gas reserves,
plans to allow companies to set up power plants. Blackouts are a
daily occurrence in Nigeria, where demand for electricity is
almost double the current supply of 3,000 megawatts.  The government will sell 11 distribution companies created
out of Power Holding Co. of  Nigeria , the state-owned utility,
and allow private companies to set up power plants using natural
gas, hydro-electric dams and coal-powered stations.  Oando shares surged the most since May, rallying the
maximum daily limit of 5 percent to close at 63 naira by the 1
p.m. close in Lagos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
