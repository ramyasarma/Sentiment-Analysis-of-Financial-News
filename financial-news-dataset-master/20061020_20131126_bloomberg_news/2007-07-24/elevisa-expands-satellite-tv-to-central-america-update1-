             Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO)  's satellite unit
expects to add 100,000 customers in Central America after entering
the region with service to  Costa Rica  last week.  
 The company's Sky satellite service began July 15 in Costa
Rica and will be offered this year in  Nicaragua , Televisa Executive
Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said in a conference call with
analysts. The service, which has 1.49 million subscribers in
Mexico, also will be available in Panama and the Dominican Republic
by yearend, De Angoitia said.  
 Televisa is seeking revenue from outside Mexico as growth of
its biggest source of revenue, broadcast television advertising,
slows. The company is expanding its cable television and satellite
business to make up for the decline in broadcast revenue.  
 ``This is a very profitable business, although the Central
American and Dominican markets are relatively small individually,''
said Marcos Duran, an analyst at Interacciones Casa de Bolsa in
Mexico City.  
 Sky's Central American service will be run from Mexico to
reduce costs, De Angoitia said.  
 Satellite sales account for 20 percent of consolidated sales
and 22 percent of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, a measure of cashflow, Televisa said. ``Sky is a
great business, and it's growing,'' De Angoitia said.
