             Dynegy Inc. (DYN) , the owner of  power
plants  in 13 U.S. states, forecast 2008 profit that fell short of
some analyst estimates.  
 Net income will be $140 million to $200 million, Houston-
based Dynegy said today in a statement prepared for a
presentation to analysts. It missed the estimate of $341.2
million from Lasan Johong, an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in
 New York . Johong expected the company to earn $333.9 million this
year, according to a Nov. 20 note to clients.  
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBITDA, excluding some one-time items, will be
$1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2008, the company said. That
compares with $935 million to $995 million this year, according
to slides accompanying the presentation.  
 ``The numbers that they announced here are certainly below
where we were and below where the consensus numbers were,'' said
Gordon Howald, an analyst at Calyon Securities USA Inc. in New
York who expected 2008 EBITDA of about $1.35 billion. ``They've
limited hedges and put themselves out there to be impacted by
changes in commodity prices'' such as lower natural-gas prices,
he said.  
 The company expects average annual EBITDA growth of about 15
percent over the next five years, Chief Executive Officer  Bruce Williamson  said on a conference call with investors. The forecast
excludes one-time items such as gains or losses from derivatives
used to lock in prices, company spokesman  David Byford  said in an
interview.  
 Spending Forecast  
 Capital spending  is expected to rise to $640 million next
year, then drop to $560 million in 2009, Dynegy said. The company
in November forecast 2007 spending of at least $370 million.  
 Dynegy fell 8 cents to $7.90 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Howald has a ``buy'' rating on the shares and
doesn't own any. The  stock  has fallen 26 percent since closing at
a five-year high on May 14.  
 ``You compare the value of the assets and where assets are
trading with the value of the equity, I think that hopefully is
seen as a good entry point for investors to come in and pick up
the stock kind of while it's on sale here,'' Williamson, 48, said
in an interview.  
 Dynegy has a generating capacity of about 19,000 megawatts,
or enough power for 15.2 million average U.S. homes, based on a
U.S. Energy Department estimate. The company completed its $3.66
billion acquisition of plants from closely held LS Power in
April, adding about 8,000 megawatts of capacity.  
 Prices for natural gas, a power-plant fuel, are used to help
set electricity prices in some of Dynegy's markets. Cheaper gas
means lower prices for power.
