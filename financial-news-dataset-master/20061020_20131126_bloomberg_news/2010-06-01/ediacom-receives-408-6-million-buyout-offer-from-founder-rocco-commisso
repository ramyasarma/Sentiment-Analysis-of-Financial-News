Mediacom Communications Corp. , the
cable-television provider in 1,500 U.S. cities and towns, agreed
to be bought by founder and Chief Executive Officer  Rocco B. Commisso  in a deal that values it at about $600 million.  Commisso owns 40 percent of Mediacom’s Class A and Class B
shares, and has 87 percent voting control. Under the merger,
Commisso would buy the stock he doesn’t own for $8.75 a share,
28 percent more than Mediacom’s closing price on Nov. 12 and a
64 percent premium above when Commisso made his first offer for
the company in May.  Commisso is looking to take advantage of the potential for
greater cash-flow yields as the company’s capital spending
falls. The $8.75 bid is seven times 2010 estimated operating
cash flow, up from 6.8 times currently, said  David Joyce , an
analyst at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, today.  “While longer-term investors are likely still going to be
disappointed, since our various valuation metrics could suggest
a mid-teens per share value in a couple of years, this is a more
palatable premium to recent trading prices,” said Joyce.  Commisso first bid $6 a share for the company in May. He
boosted the figure in August, and that offer was rejected by a
special committee of independent directors, with details not
disclosed. The latest bid requires approval from shareholders
who hold a majority of the Class A stock, excluding those owned
by Commisso, his family and Mediacom directors and officers, and
is expected to close in the first half of 2011.  Cable Goes Private  Mediacom, based in Middletown, New York, climbed $1.51, or
22 percent, to $8.37 at 4 p.m. New York time in  Nasdaq Stock
Market  trading, for the biggest gain since March 23, 2009.  The company is joining U.S. cable operators such as  Cox
Communications Inc.  in going private. Mediacom has about 1.2
million video customers mostly in Iowa and Illinois, making it
the eighth-largest U.S. cable operator.  The founding family of Cablevision Systems Corp., a New
York-area cable provider, has been unsuccessful in two attempts
in the last five years to buy out its public shareholders. Cox,
the third-largest U.S. cable company, went private in 2004.
 Insight Communications Co.  became private in 2008.  Mediacom reported its third-quarter loss narrowed to $4
million, or 6 cents a share, from a loss of $10 million, or 15
cents a share in the year prior. Sales rose 3 percent to $374
million as the number of broadband customers increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
