             The International Monetary Fund’s
gold holdings fell by 15.25 metric tons (490,286 ounces) in May,
according to figures from the Washington-based lender. Russia’s
assets expanded by 22.46 tons.  
 Reserves of gold at the IMF were 2,951.58 tons at the end
of May compared with 2,966.83 tons at the end of April, data on
the IMF’s website show. Russia increased holdings to 703.1 tons
in May, from 680.64 tons, and has added gold every month since
at least February, the data show.  
 The IMF plans to sell a total of 403.3 tons of gold. India,
Mauritius and Sri Lanka bought 212 tons last year and the IMF in
February said it would begin selling the remainder on the open
market. The combined February-to-May sales would leave about
137.5 tons as of the beginning of last month.  
 This “is an indication that they will continue to sell the
remaining 137.5 tons on-market as opposed to via off-market
transactions with other central banks,” said  Daniel Major , an
analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. “Indeed
the decline in gold sales from European central banks and
purchases from India, Russia and China in recent years
demonstrates gold’s growing popularity with central banks.”  
 Central banks have been adding to reserves and gold-backed
exchange-traded fund assets have advanced to a record as
investors sought an alternative to currencies and a protection
of wealth from Europe’s debt crisis. Gold traded at $1,243.45 an
ounce at 4:16 p.m. in London and reached a record $1,265.30 on
June 21.  
 China Reserves  
 Central banks and governments added 425.4 tons to their
holdings last year to 30,116.9 tons, the most since 1964 and the
first expansion since 1988, data from the  World Gold Council 
show. Official reserves may expand by another 192 to 289 tons
this year, CPM Group, a research and asset-management company in
New York, said last month.  
 China increased its reserves of gold by 454 tons to 1,054
tons since 2003, the Foreign Exchange Administration said in
April last year.
