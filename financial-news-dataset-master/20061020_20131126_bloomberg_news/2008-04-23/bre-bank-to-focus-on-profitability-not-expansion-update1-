             BRE Bank SA, the Polish unit of
 Commerzbank AG (CBK) , will focus on increasing its profitability and
not on expanding in neighboring countries, Chief Executive
Officer Mariusz Grendowicz said.  
 ``Uncontrolled expansion, planting the flag, will not be a
priority,'' Grendowicz said. ``Our priority now will be
profitability, concentration on how and not how fast we
expand.''  
 BRE, which has units in the Czech Republic and Slovakia,
boosted retail deposits and lending by more than half in the
first quarter from a year earlier, Grendowicz said at a press
conference in Warsaw today. The CEO, 47, took over the post last
month, replacing Slawomir Lachowski.  
 BRE has no plans to withdraw from neighboring countries,
where it attracted 295 million euros ($471 million) of deposits,
according to Grendowicz. Still, it's suspending further
expansion, he said. In the Commerzbank group, BRE will be
responsible for startup ventures in the countries of the central
and eastern European region, while Commerzbank will buy other
lenders.  
 Grendowicz reiterated BRE may publish some amendments to
its strategy in September, adding that the current one is
``dynamic and reflects today needs.''  
 BRE attracted 150 new corporate clients and 115,000
individuals in the first quarter, the CEO said.
