             The Chinese government ordered
 China  National Petroleum Corp., China Petrochemical Corp. and
two other oil companies to increase diesel supplies to rural
areas as the crop-planting season starts in the country.  
 The parents of PetroChina Co.,  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (386) , China National Offshore Oil Corp. and Shaanxi Yanchang
Oil Industrial Group Co., the nation's four largest refiners,
must run their plants at full capacity under safe conditions,
the Ministry of Commerce said on its  Web site  today.  
 China's spring planting season starts in March, boosting
demand for fuels to run tractors and power generators. The
nation, the world's second-largest energy consumer, increased
diesel imports by 49 percent last month, the Customs General
Administration of China said April 15.  
 ``Every local commerce department must work with fuels
distribution companies to closely monitor the supply and demand
of oil products in the rural areas,'' the ministry said.  
 The government will punish any seller that illegally raises
fuel prices and hoards oil, it said.
