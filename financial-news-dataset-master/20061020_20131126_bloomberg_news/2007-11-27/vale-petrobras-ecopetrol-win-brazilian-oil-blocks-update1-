             Cia. Vale do Rio Doce , which is
seeking new sources of energy as part of a $59 billion
expansion of its iron-ore, nickel and other mining businesses,
won four oil exploration blocks in Brazil in partnership with a
pair of  oil companies .  
 Vale will have 30 percent in three exploration areas in
the Atlantic ocean off the coast of Brazil's Maranhao and Para
states.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil's state-controlled oil
company, will own 40 percent and operate the projects, while
 Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia's state-controlled oil company, will own
30 percent.  
 Vale and  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) , the oil unit
of Brazilian Billionaire  Eike Batista 's EBX mining group, are
seeking new energy sources to secure power for their mining and
industrial operations. Prices for power have risen and may
climb further if a power shortage occurs as a result of natural
gas supply difficulties or a lack of rain.  
 ``These companies are looking for ways to ensure their
energy needs,'' Energy Minister Nelson Hubner said today at the
auction in Rio de Janeiro. ``They are also looking to diversify
their resource operations.''

 OGX today spent more than 1 billion reais on exploration
blocks today, more than any other company so far in the auction
that runs through tomorrow.  
 The Petrobras, Vale, Ecopetrol group paid 5.31 million
reais ($2.86 million) for the rights to explore the blocks at
an auction today in  Rio de Janeiro .  
 Vale preferred shares, its most traded class of stock,
fell 11 centavos, or 0.2 percent, to 47.89 reais. Ecopetrol,
which was scheduled to have its trading debut today, was
suspended after rising more than 10 percent on Bogota's stock
exchange.  
 Trading was suspended for 30 minutes after shares rose
1,540 pesos to its 10 percent upper limit, an exchange
spokesman said in a phone interview. Shares resumed trading and
were halted until tomorrow after rising to 1,690 pesos.
