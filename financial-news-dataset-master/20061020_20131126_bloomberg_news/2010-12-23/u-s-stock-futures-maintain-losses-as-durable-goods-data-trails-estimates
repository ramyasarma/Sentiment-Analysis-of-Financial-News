U.S. stock-index futures maintained
losses after orders for durable goods trailed the average
economist forecast.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index contracts fell 0.1 percent to
1,252.70 at 8:33 a.m. New York time. The benchmark measure of
U.S. shares closed at a two-year high yesterday.  Orders for durable goods fell 1.3 percent in November, a
bigger drop than the 0.5 percent median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
