The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will reduce shipments for the first time
since October, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements, as
demand for winter fuels falls.  Shipments  will drop 0.2 percent to 23.51 million barrels a
day in the four weeks to Jan. 8 from 23.56 million barrels in
the period to Dec. 11, Oil Movements said today in a report. The
data exclude Ecuador and Angola. OPEC’s seven Arab-country
members will gather in Cairo on Dec. 25 for an annual meeting.  Exports from Middle Eastern producers, including those from
non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen, will be unchanged at 17.46
million barrels a day, data from Oil Movements show.  OPEC  maintained its current oil production quota of 24.845
million barrels a day at a meeting on Dec. 11 in Quito, Ecuador,
as member nations consider the global recovery strong enough to
withstand price gains. The organization will meet next in June.  A total of 472.33 million barrels of crude will be on board
tankers in the month to Jan. 8, up 1 percent on the Dec. 11
figure of 467.45 million barrels, according to Oil Movements.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by keeping a tally of
tanker-rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on
board ships used as floating storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
