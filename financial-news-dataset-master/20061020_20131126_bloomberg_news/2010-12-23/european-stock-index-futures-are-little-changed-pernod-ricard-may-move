European stocks  climbed for a fourth
day, extending a 27-month high for the benchmark Stoxx Europe
600 Index, as reports in the U.S. showed the recovery in the
world’s largest economy is intact.  Aixtron AG, which makes equipment used to produce light-
emitting diode screens, surged 9.2 percent on a report it won an
order in China. Allied Irish Banks Plc slumped 20 percent after
becoming the fourth lender to fall under government control
since 2008. SSAB slid 2.8 percent as Sweden’s largest steelmaker
said fourth-quarter earnings will be “close to zero.”  The  Stoxx 600  climbed 0.1 percent to 281.76 at the 4:30
p.m. close in London, after swinging between gains and losses at
least 20 times. The gauge has recovered from the plunge that
followed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse in September
2008 as companies reported higher earnings, the European Union
bailed out Greece and Ireland and the Federal Reserve unveiled
$600 billion of additional bond purchases to help the economy.  “Despite very low trading volume it seems as if risk is
still on the upside,” said  Christian Falkner , an analyst at
Alpha Wertpapierhandels GmbH in Frankfurt. “If the sovereign
debt crisis doesn’t worsen much, it won’t have too much negative
impact on stock market. At the end of January, investors will
start looking at preliminary reporting from U.S. companies and
guidance for 2011.”  Trading volume on the  Stoxx 600  has declined every day this
week as the Christmas holiday approaches, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Economy  Reports in the U.S. today showed consumer spending and new-
home purchases increased, fewer people filed applications for
jobless-benefit claims, and consumer sentiment climbed to a six-
month high.  Britain’s  service industries  weakened in October, led by
government, transport and telecommunications services,
indicating the economic recovery may have lost momentum.
Services, which account for three quarters of the economy, fell
0.4 percent from the previous month, when they rose 0.7 percent,
the Office for National Statistics said.  National benchmark indexes advanced in 9 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.2 percent, while
France’s  CAC 40  decreased 0.2 percent and Germany’s DAX slipped
0.1 percent.  Aixtron Advances  Aixtron soared 9.2 percent to 27.24 euros, the biggest gain
in more than two months. China’s LED industry is expected to
install 700 to 800 units of metal organic chemical vapor
deposition equipment, or MOCVD, machines in 2011, more than
double this year’s pace, Digitimes.com reported, without saying
where it obtained the information. One LED maker has ordered 400
to 500 MOCVD machines from Aixtron, Digitimes said, citing
unidentified people.  SAS AB  soared 14 percent to 23.7 kronor, the biggest
increase in eight months. Deutsche Lufthansa AG may announce
takeover plans for the Nordic region’s biggest airline as early
as the first half of 2011, according to a person with knowledge
of the discussions.  Novo Nordisk A/S , the world’s biggest maker of insulin,
advanced 3.2 percent to 633 kroner, the first advance this week.
The company said a late-stage study of its insulin Degludec
showed it “significantly reduces risk” of hypoglycemia during
the night compared with glargine.  Allied Irish Banks sank 20 percent to 32.1 euro cents after
the High Court said the government can take control of the
lender without shareholder approval. The state will inject 3.7
billion euros ($4.8 billion) into the Dublin-based bank and
raise its stake to 92 percent from 19 percent.  SSAB, Ericsson  SSAB  lost 2.8 percent to 107.7 kronor as the steelmaker

Sachs Group Inc. downgraded the world’s biggest maker of mobile-
phone networks to “neutral” from “buy.”  Logitech International SA  slid 1.8 percent to 18.44 Swiss
