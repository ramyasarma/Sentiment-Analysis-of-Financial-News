A copy of  Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. ’s top-selling multiple sclerosis medicine
Copaxone may win U.S. approval as soon as next month, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch analysts said.  A 30-month stay of approval on the copy, manufactured by
 Novartis AG  and  Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. , expires on or
around Jan. 16, New York-based analyst  Gregg Gilbert  said in a
note today. Approval of the generic is possible “at least in
theory” on that day, though the Food and Drug Administration
will likely need more time to review it, Gilbert said.  Teva has said the drug’s molecular structure is so complex
that clinical trials should be required to prove that any copied
version has the same effect. The drug has about 40 percent of
the MS market, Gilbert said. It accounted for 18 percent of
Teva’s $13.9 billion in  sales  last year and contributes
“disproportionately” to profit, Teva said.  “While key patents protect the drug into 2014, generic
challengers in the U.S. hope to launch sooner,” Gilbert wrote.  Teva has sued to block the copy from Basel-based Novartis
and Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Momenta. The partners are
free to launch at-risk without warning Teva beforehand if the
FDA approves their copy, Gilbert said.  The Petah Tikva, Israel-based drugmaker has asked the FDA
for approval of a lower-volume version of Copaxone. A ruling on
the new version of the drug may come after Jan. 1, Gilbert said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
