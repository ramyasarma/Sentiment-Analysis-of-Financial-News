Uganda’s trade deficit narrowed 35
percent in October from the previous month as coffee exports
increased, the central bank said.  The gap shrank to $147 million as exports rose 18 percent
to $187 million and imports declined 13 percent to $334 million,
the Bank of Uganda said today in a statement handed to reporters
in the capital, Kampala. Coffee exports climbed 23 percent to
$23.3 million.  The central bank also said that it sold $60 million in
November to stem the depreciation of the shilling, which dropped
1.1 percent to 2,289 per dollar in the month. Demand for dollars
from offshore investors and manufacturers was one of the reasons
for the decline, it said.  Uganda had $2.72 billion of foreign reserves at the end of
October, enough to cover 5.1 months of imports, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
