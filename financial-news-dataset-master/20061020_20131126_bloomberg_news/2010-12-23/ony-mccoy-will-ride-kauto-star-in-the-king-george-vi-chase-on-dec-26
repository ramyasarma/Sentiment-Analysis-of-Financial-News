Tony McCoy will ride  Kauto Star  in
the King George VI Chase on Dec. 26 as the horse seeks a record
fifth straight victory in the race.  McCoy, a 15-time champion jockey, was booked by trainer
 Paul Nicholls  after Noel Fehily was ruled out with a wrist
problem. Fehily had himself come in for  Ruby Walsh , also
injured.  “He’s a fantastic horse, he stays well and if he puts up
anything close to his King George performances beforehand he’ll
win it,” McCoy told the British Broadcasting Corp.’s Radio Five
Live. After McCoy was booked to ride, Kauto Star’s odds narrowed
to 5-6 from evens with bookmaker Ladbrokes Plc, so a successful
six-pound bet would return 11 pounds including the stake.  The three-mile race, one of the biggest in the U.K. jumps
calendar, takes place at Kempton Park near London. There’s
concern that this year’s race meeting may not take place because
of freezing weather that has affected much of Britain. Officials
will inspect the course at noon tomorrow to decide whether to go
ahead after temperatures again dropped to below freezing last
night. More sub-zero weather is forecast.  McCoy, previously due to ride Albertas Run this year, won
the race on Best Mate in 2002. Last weekend, he received the BBC
Sports Personality of the Year Award, the first jockey to get
the accolade in its 57-year history.  Kauto Star’s racing career may draw to a close at the end
of the season should the horse win the King George and the
Cheltenham Gold Cup in March, owner Clive Smith has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
