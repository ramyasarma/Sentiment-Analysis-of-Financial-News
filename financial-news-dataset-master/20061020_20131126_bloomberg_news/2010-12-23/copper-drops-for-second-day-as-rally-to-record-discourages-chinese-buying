Copper declined for a second day in
London as the metal’s rally to a record deterred purchases in
China, the largest user. Zinc and tin also fell.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange dropped as
much as 0.9 percent to $9,266.25 a metric ton and traded at
$9,326 at 3:14 p.m. in Singapore. The contract fell for the
first time in four days yesterday, after reaching a record
$9,392 a ton on Dec. 21.  “We’re bound to see demand destruction from price-
sensitive Chinese buyers, more so because we’re currently in the
slow-consumption season,” said Yang Jun, a Beijing-based
analyst at Hongyuan Futures Co.  Futures on the Comex in New York fell as much as 0.9
percent to $4.238 a pound after reaching a record $4.2965
yesterday. The metal for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange ended the day little changed at 68,660 yuan ($10,336) a
ton after fluctuating between gains and losses.  Inventories  monitored by the London Metal Exchange rose for
the eighth consecutive session yesterday to the highest since
Nov. 10.  Stockpiles  monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained 10 percent to a six-month high last week.  Copper stockpiles in LME warehouses may gain through Lunar
New Year in February as traders in China re-route metal
previously intended for imports because of ample local supplies
and slow seasonal demand, Sucden Financial Ltd. said earlier
this month. The week-long Chinese holiday, when many plants
suspend output, runs from Feb. 2.  Copper Shortfall  The International Copper Study Group is expecting a
435,000-ton global deficit in the refined metal next year,
prompting analysts including those at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Standard Chartered Plc to call for higher prices in 2011.
 Jeremy Gray , Standard Chartered’s global head of equity research
for resources, forecast in an August report that copper may rise
to $12,000 a ton in the next two years.  “While the longer-term fundamentals are supportive of
prices, I do think investors outside of China are being a bit
too optimistic about China’s demand going forward,” said Yang.
“What the government does to fight inflation remains a wild
card for the market.”  Consumer prices in China jumped 5.1 percent last month, the
fastest rate in 28 months, prompting speculation that China may
step up measures to curb lending and raise interest rates.
Policy makers have this year increased lenders’ reserve
requirements several times and introduced real-estate curbs in
an effort to rein in credit and speculation.  Aluminum and nickel in London were little changed at $2,460
a ton and $24.040 a ton, respectively, and lead was unchanged at
$2,440 a ton. Zinc fell 0.4 percent to $2,319.75 a ton and tin
slipped 0.3 percent to $26,750.  To contact the reporter on this story:
