Tesco Plc , the U.K.’s largest
retailer, bought 128 Zabka and Koruna convenience stores in the
Czech Republic for 1.02 billion koruna ($52.8 million) to cement
its position in the eastern European nation.  The acquisition from Penta Investments Ltd., a central
European private equity firm, is subject to regulatory approval,
 Eva Karasova , a spokeswoman for Tesco, said from Prague.  Tesco had  sales  of 1.28 billion pounds ($1.97 billion) in
the Czech Republic in the last fiscal year, making the country
its fifth-largest in Europe by revenue. The 47 Koruna stores and
81 Zabka franchised kiosks will bolster Tesco’s Express format,
the retailer said. The U.K. company has 173 outlets in the Czech
Republic, where the grocery market is worth $50 billion a year.  “This step is part of Tesco’s long-term strategy,” Philip
J. Clarke, head of the Cheshunt, England-based retailer’s Czech
unit, said in an e-mailed statement. “This step will allow us
to tap a fast-developing segment of the retail market.”  Tesco rose 1.45 pence, or 0.3 percent, to 433.45 pence at
10:20 a.m. in London trading and has gained 1.3 percent in 2010.  The acquisition doesn’t include Penta Investments’ Zabka
outlets in Poland. Penta will decide on a possible initial
public offering or direct sale of Zabka Polska SA in the first
quarter of 2011, said  Jozef Janov , director of the Czech-Slovak
investment firm. A potential deal may exceed 500 million polish
zloty ($165 million), according to Janov.  Zabka runs 2,350 stores in the Czech Republic and Poland,
adding 650 outlets in the last three years. The company forecast
full-year revenue of 2.5 billion zloty compared with 1.5 billion
zloty in 2006. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization probably rose to 120 million zloty in 2010 from 46
million zloty in 2006, Penta said on Dec. 21.  BC Partners Ltd. and Mid Europa Partners filed final bids
for Zabka Polska SA, three people with knowledge of the process
said earlier this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
