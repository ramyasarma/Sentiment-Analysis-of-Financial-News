Desjardins Financial Group, Canada’s
largest credit union, agreed to acquire  Western Financial Group
Inc.  for C$443 million ($439 million) to expand in British
Columbia and Alberta.  Desjardins, based in Levis, Quebec, will make a cash offer
of C$4.15 per share for Western, the High River, Alberta-based
insurer and provider of investment services, according to a
joint statement. The offer is 69 percent higher than the closing

is seeking to expand beyond Quebec. Western, with half a million
customers, has 121 offices in British Columbia, Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, according to the statement.  “This transaction will allow us to accelerate our business
development in Western Canada,” said Leroux. “We are always
open to growth opportunities and partnerships that will further
benefit our members and clients and contribute to the long-term
development of our cooperative financial group.”  Western rose  C$1.71, or 70 percent, to C$4.16 at the 1 p.m.
close of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Desjardins
Securities Inc. is the financial adviser to Desjardins Financial
Group and TD Securities is advising Western, according to the
