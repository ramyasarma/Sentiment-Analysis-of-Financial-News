Three Australians were convicted by
a Melbourne jury of plotting a terror attack on an army base in
Sydney,  the Age newspaper reported.   Wissam Mahmoud Fattal, 34, of Melbourne, Saney Edow Aweys,
27 of Carlton and Nayef El Sayed, 26, Glenroy, were today found
guilty by a 13-member jury, the Age said. Two of their co-
accused were acquitted, the newspaper said.  The three men were angered by Australia’s military
involvement in Afghanistan and the Middle East and sought a
religious ruling, or fatwa, from leaders in Somalia on the
permissibility of staging attacks in Australia, the jury was
told during the trial, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
