U.K. banks approved the fewest
mortgages last month since March 2009 when the economy was in
the depths of the recession, according to the British Bankers’
Association.  Lenders granted 29,991 home loans, compared with 30,689 in
October, the London-based lobby group said in an e-mailed
statement today. A separate report by the Home Builders
Federation showed that more than 2.7 million people age 20 to 34
are still living with their parents as first-time buyers
struggle to afford homes.  “Housing market activity remains stuck in the doldrums,
which seems highly likely to maintain downward pressure on
prices,” Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight in
London, said in a note to clients. “The housing market has
got little going for it at the moment, apart from low mortgage
rates -- and that is if you can get a mortgage.”  Demand for homes has weakened as banks restrict lending and
consumers brace for the biggest fiscal squeeze since World War
II. Recent data have painted a mixed picture of the housing
market, with supply shortages underpinning prices in some areas.  Acadametrics Ltd. and LSL Property Services Plc said on
Dec. 10 that house prices increased to the highest in more than
two years in November. Halifax, the mortgage lending division of
Lloyds Banking Group Plc, said prices fell 0.1 percent.  The average age of a first-time buyer is now 37, while the
average deposit is 37,000 pounds ($57,000), the Home Builders
Federation said in an e-mailed statement today. At the same
time, housebuilding is at its lowest since 1923, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
