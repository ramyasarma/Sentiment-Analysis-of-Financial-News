Star Africa Corp. , a Zimbabwean
maker of syrups and other sugar products, said its loss in the
six months ended Sept. 30 widened to $5 million from $2.56
million a year earlier.  Revenue declined to $52 million from $54 million, the
company said in a statement published in the Harare-based Herald
newspaper.  The company’s wholesale unit, Red Star, accounted for about
two-thirds of the loss, Star Africa said. Efforts to raise new
capital for the unit in the first half were unsuccessful, and
Star Africa plans to reduce the wholesaler’s branch network
after buying full ownership of the unit from minority
shareholders, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
