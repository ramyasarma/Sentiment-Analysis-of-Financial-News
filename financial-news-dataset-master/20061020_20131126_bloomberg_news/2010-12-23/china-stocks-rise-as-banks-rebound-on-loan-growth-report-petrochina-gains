China’s stocks rose as banks
rebounded on an Economic Observer report that loan growth in
2011 will be sustained at this year’s levels.  The Shanghai Composite Index advanced 13.9, or 0.5 percent,
to 2,891.81 at 1:34 p.m., erasing a drop of as much as 0.8
percent. China Construction Bank Corp. gained 1.3 percent and
Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. climbed 1.2 percent.  The National Development and Reform Commission has
submitted a proposal for a 7.5 trillion yuan loan quota for the
next year to the State Council, The Economic Observer said,
without citing anybody.  The People’s Bank of China had initially proposed a quota
of 6.5 trillion yuan and the NDRC, as the national planner is
known, had suggested 8 trillion yuan, the report said.  PetroChina Co., the biggest company in China, gained 0.4
percent to 11.49 yuan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
