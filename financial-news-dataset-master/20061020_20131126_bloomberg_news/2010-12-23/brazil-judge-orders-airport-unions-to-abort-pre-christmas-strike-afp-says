A Brazilian labor court judge
ordered aviation unions to abort an airport strike planned for
today, Agence France-Presse said, citing a ruling.  Milton de Moura Franca, president of the High Labor
Tribunal in Brasilia, said unions would be fined $60,000 a day
if services fell below 80 percent, the report said.  The judge invoked constitutional rights to freedom of
movement and a “free, fair and united society” in the ruling,
handed down late yesterday. The unions had been planning a
strike after pay talks broke down, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
