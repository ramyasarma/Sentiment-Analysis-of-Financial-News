What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets. U.S. markets will be closed
tomorrow for the Christmas holiday.  -- Soybean futures were called to open steady to 3 cents higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade after a government report showed
increasing Chinese demand for U.S. supplies, said  Mark Schultz ,
the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
Minneapolis. Soybean-meal futures may open steady to $1 lower
per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open steady to
down 0.1 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that rain may reduce stress on crops in
Argentina and boost plant development in Brazil, Schultz said.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as demand ebbs following a 45 percent rally this
year, Schultz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
