U.S. natural gas is poised to extend
its biggest annual decline since 2004 as new pipelines from the
Rocky Mountains deepen an unprecedented glut of the fuel.  National spot prices at the Henry Hub, the delivery point
for New York Mercantile Exchange futures, fell 1.72 cents below
those at  Opal Hub, Wyoming , the benchmark price for the Rockies,
for the first time in a year on Nov. 22. They have  averaged  43
cents more than Opal’s so far this year and were as much as
$7.52 higher in September 2008.  About 3.8 billion cubic feet a day of gas, equivalent to
6.1 percent of national output, will be able to be pumped next
year from states such as Wyoming, home to the nation’s second-
largest reserves, to California and Illinois, the U.S.’s second-
and fifth-largest consumers, as new pipelines open. U.S. futures
have tumbled 26 percent in 2010 as stockpiles climbed to an all-
time high for the second consecutive year.  “Historically, Rockies gas prices were phenomenally low
because they couldn’t get the gas to the customers, and now it’s
moving out to the markets and arriving at a time of high gas
inventories,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG
Economics, an energy-research firm in London, Arkansas. “So it
just exacerbates the national price weakness.”  Two new connections from the Rockies will come on line next
year. The 302-mile (486-kilometer)  Bison Pipeline , owned by
 TransCanada Corp. , will have a capacity of 477 million cubic
feet a day from the Powder River Basin in south Montana and
northeast Wyoming to the Midwest. It will start service in mid-
January. The 680-mile  Ruby Pipeline , owned by  El Paso Corp. ,
will be able to send 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Pacific
West, starting in June.  Rockies Express  The supplies will add to those already moving via the
1,679-mile Rockies Express Pipeline, partly owned by Houston-
based  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners . The link started in
November 2009 and can pump as much as 1.8 billion cubic feet a
day of gas to the Midwest.  “You have a supply base in the Rockies but not much demand
there, and the more you open up these pipelines the more gas you
take from that region into higher-demand markets,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst at Canaccord Genuity in Houston. “The price
spreads are narrowing in anticipation of the opening of new
pipelines.”  Spot  prices at Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, rose 7.4
cents, or 1.9 percent, to $4.09 per million British thermal
units, according to the Intercontinental Exchange. Opal Hub gas
traded at $3.83 per million Btu, up 8.5 cents, or 2.3 percent.  2011 Prices  Henry Hub prices will decline for a third straight year in
2011, averaging $4.33 per million Btu, down from this year’s
estimated average of $4.37, according to the Energy Department
in Washington. Futures for January delivery fell 7.6 cents, or
1.8 percent, to settle at $4.076 per million Btu on the Nymex.  Wyoming produced 2.27 trillion cubic feet of gas in 2008,
the latest year  Energy Department  data for both demand and
production are available, almost 16 times its consumption of
142.7 billion cubic feet. The state has reserves of 36.7
trillion cubic feet, mostly so-called tight gas from shale
formations with low permeability, according to the  department .
Texas has reserves of 85 trillion, the biggest in the U.S.  The links “raise the prices to producers in the Rockies
but add to the national price weakness for gas,” said Williams.
Rockies gas “is certainly increasing national stockpiles.”  Production will rise to a record 62.09 billion cubic feet a
day this year, up 7 percent from 2008, according to the  Energy
Department . Wyoming produced an unprecedented 2.36 trillion
cubic feet in 2009, up 4 percent.  Record Stockpiles  Stockpiles of gas  climbed to a record 3.843 trillion cubic
feet in the week ended Nov. 12, according to the department. Gas
in U.S. storage totaled 3.561 trillion cubic feet for the week
ended Dec. 10, 9.9 percent above the five-year average and 1
percent below last year’s level.  The Ruby pipeline will help boost gas production in
Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado by 750 million cubic feet a day by
2015, according to Bentek Energy LLC, an Evergreen, Colorado-
based energy market-research company. The three states currently
produce 7 billion cubic feet a day.  “By the time Ruby gets in, Opal will get a little bit
stronger, and Henry Hub prices will be lower, so there will be
general basis tightening from both affects,” said Jack Weixel,
director of client services at Evergreen, Colorado-based Bentek.  The Ruby line, which starts from Opal Hub and ends at
Malin, Oregon, will connect gas from the Rockies to  PG&E Corp., 
California’s biggest utility owner, through the existing Oregon-
California interstate pipelines.  California used 2.45 trillion cubic feet of gas in 2008,
the latest year government data were available, according to  the
Energy Department . That’s about 11 percent of total U.S. gas
consumption, the second highest after Texas. The state produced
296.5 billion cubic feet of gas in the same year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
