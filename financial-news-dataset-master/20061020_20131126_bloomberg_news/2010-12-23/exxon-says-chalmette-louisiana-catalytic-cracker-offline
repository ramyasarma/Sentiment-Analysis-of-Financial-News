Exxon Mobil Corp.  shut down a fluid
catalytic cracking unit Dec. 18 at its Chalmette refinery in
Louisiana, according to  Kevin Allexon , a company spokesman. The
schedule for the unit’s restart is undetermined, he said.  “At this time the refinery is operational and all customer
needs are being met,” Allexon said.  Unplanned and planned refinery outages can increase prices
for refined products as companies turn to spot markets to help
them meet supply contracts. Operational disruptions can also
depress prices for crude oil as less feedstock is used.  The refinery is a joint venture with  Petroleos de Venezuela
SA  and has a capacity of 200,700 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chalmette is in St. Bernard Parish, adjacent to New
Orleans.  To contact the reporters on this story:
