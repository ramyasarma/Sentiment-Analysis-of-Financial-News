South Korean  consumer confidence 
declined in December as people became less optimistic about the
economy and job prospects.  The sentiment index fell to 109 from 110 in November, the
Bank of Korea said in an e-mailed statement in  Seoul  today. A
number exceeding 100 indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.  The central bank left borrowing costs at 2.5 percent this
month after an appreciation in the nation’s currency contributed
to a moderation in economic expansion. It increased  interest
rates  by a quarter percentage-point each in July and November
from a record-low 2 percent. Gross domestic product growth will
cool to 4.5 percent next year, from 6.1 percent in 2010, the
monetary authority said on Dec. 10.  A sub-index measuring consumers’ views of the economic
outlook dropped to 105 in December from 108 in November, while
the sub-index on the job outlook fell to 100 from 104. The
expected inflation rate over the next year rose to 3.3 percent
from 3.2 percent.  The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 2,103 households in 56 cities and was conducted by mail and
telephone between Dec. 13 and Dec. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
