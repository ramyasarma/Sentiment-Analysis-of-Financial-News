Constellation Brands Inc., the
world’s largest wine business, agreed to sell its Australian and
U.K. operations to Champ Private Equity of Sydney, in a
transaction valued at about A$290 million ($290.8 million).  The deal is expected to close by the end of January,
Victor, New York-based Constellation said in a statement today.
It will include almost all of Constellation’s Australian, U.K,
and South African brands. Constellation will retain a stake of
about 20 percent interest in the business, according to the
statement.  The unit being sold, which sells wines from Australian
appellation, has faced challenging market conditions and doesn’t
fit with Constellation’s strategy anymore, Chief Executive
Officer  Rob  Sands said in the statement.  Constellation rose 41 cents $22.43 at 12:42 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had risen 38
percent this year before today.  Brown-Forman Corp ., the maker of Jack Daniel’s whiskey,
said yesterday it may sell some of its wine businesses as part
of a strategic review. The sale may include the mid-priced
Fetzer brand, Louisville, Kentucky-based Brown-Forman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
