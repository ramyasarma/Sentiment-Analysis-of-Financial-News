The rand may extend its advance from
an almost three-year high and gain a further 2 percent by year-
end should it breach the 6.77 per-dollar level at the close of
trading, said  Econometrix Treasury Management .  A close stronger than that resistance level would propel
South Africa’s currency to 6.71, from which it may gain to 6.64,
Trevor Barsdorf, an analyst at Johannesburg-based ETM, a bond
and foreign-exchange advisory, said in a telephone interview.  The rand appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 6.7559 per
dollar, its best intraday level since January 2008, and traded
0.4 percent up at 6.7725 as of 11:28 a.m. in Johannesburg from a
close of 6.7975 yesterday.  “If the rand cracks through 6.77 then you’re looking at
6.71 and if it cracks through there you’re talking 6.64,” said
Barsdorf. “The key level is 6.77 -- it coincides with the prior
lows” for the dollar versus the rand since the start of
November.  Apart from today’s move, the rand has twice breached 6.77
per dollar in the past two months, climbing to 6.7683 on Nov. 4
and to 6.7603 on Nov. 5. On both occasions the rand failed to
close stronger than 6.77, making it a key technical resistance
level for the currency, said Barsdorf.  The rand has surged 39 percent since the start of last year
as developed nations cut rates to near zero to pull their
economies out of recession, encouraging investors to place their
money in higher-yielding, emerging markets. South Africa’s
 central bank rate  is 5.5 percent, even after policy makers
lowered it nine times since December 2008 to boost growth.  “On a trade-weighted basis, the rand is on the front foot
and as long as quantitative-easing measures in the U.S. and
Europe continue, the search for yield will persist and the rand
will keep grinding stronger,” Barsdorf said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
