Most  Asian stocks  declined as
developers in China fell after the government stepped up
scrutiny of real estate investments to curb rising housing
property prices, countering gains among exporters and commodity
producers.  China Vanke Co. , the nation’s biggest property developer,
lost 1.8 percent in Shenzhen. Bank of China Ltd., the country’s
third-largest lender by market value, slipped 1.2 percent. Li &
Fung Ltd., the largest supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., climbed
2.3 percent in Hong Kong after a government report showed the
U.S. economy expanded faster than previously estimated.  “It helps to see signs that the U.S. economic outlook
looks to be brighter in the short term, but how long this can be
sustained remains as a question,” said  Castor Pang , Hong Kong-
based research director at Cinda International Holdings Ltd.
“Markets are likely to move sideways toward the yearend.
Further policy tightening may take place anytime. Developers are
particularly under selling pressure.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index Excluding Japan Index  increased
0.1 percent to 470.97 as of 6:38 p.m. in Hong Kong, with about
seven stocks declining for every five that advanced. The gauge
has climbed 5 percent this month as China refrained from raising
interest rates and U.S. reports on consumer confidence, the
trade deficit and unemployment beat analyst estimates.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.4 percent, its highest
close since Nov. 5, as takeovers in the country surged to a
record this quarter.  New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  gained 0.3 percent as economists
said the economy will rebound after a Statistics New Zealand
report today showed gross domestic product unexpectedly
contracted in the third quarter.  Shanghai Retreats  Taiwan’s Taiex Index increased 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index declined 0.6 percent, while Japanese markets are
closed today for a public holiday.  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index  dropped 0.8 percent. The
government increased land supply this year and stepped up the
scrutiny of real estate investments by foreign companies as it
rolls out more measures to contain 18 months of gains in
property prices, the land and resources and commerce ministries
reported.  China Vanke retreated 1.8 percent to 8.84 yuan in Shenzhen.
China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., controlled by the
nation’s construction ministry, slid 1.4 percent to HK$14.60 in
Hong Kong.  Country Garden Holdings Co. , the property developer
controlled by China’s richest woman, lost 1.3 percent to HK$2.95.  Bank of China slid 1.2 percent to HK$4.04. Agricultural
Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s fourth-biggest lender by assets,
slumped 4.2 percent to HK$3.86.  China Construction Bank Corp. ,
the country’s second-largest lender, fell 0.7 percent to HK$6.86.  U.S. Economic Growth  Futures on the U.S.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. U.S. stocks and oil climbed to the highest levels
since 2008 yesterday after government reports showed the economy
expanded faster than previously estimated and crude supplies
dropped to the lowest level since February.  The  Standard and Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.3 percent to
1,258.84 at 4 p.m. in New York yesterday, driving its gain this
year to 13 percent. The gauge rose for the fifth day after a
report showed the world’s largest economy grew at a 2.6 percent
annual rate last quarter, above the government’s previous
estimate of 2.5 percent.  Li & Fung , which counts the U.S. as its biggest market,
gained 2.3 percent to HK$44.25. Hon Hai Precision, which gets
about 36 percent of sales from America, increased 1.7 percent to
NT$118 in Taipei. Infosys Technologies Ltd., India’s second-
largest exporter of computer software, rose 1.1 percent to
3,367.9 rupees.  Oil Producers Gain  Gauges  of raw material producers and consumer staple
companies led the advance among the 10 industry groups in the
MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company and
Australia’s No. 1 oil and gas producers, gained 1.4 percent to
A$46.47 in Sydney. PetroChina Co., that nation’s largest oil
company, increased 0.4 percent to HK$9.98 in Hong Kong. Ezra
Holdings Ltd., a provider of logistics services to the oil and
gas industry, climbed 3.5 percent to S$1.77.  Oil rose 0.7 percent to $90.48 a barrel in New York, with
futures rallying after the U.S. Energy Department said
stockpiles dropped 5.33 million barrels. Crude for February
delivery reached the highest level since October 2008.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding  Japan Index  has risen 13
percent this year on speculation that growth in corporate
profits will weather Europe’s debt crisis, Chinese steps to curb
property-price inflation and concern about the pace of the U.S.
economic rebound.  Mozambique Reserves  Trinity Ltd. , the luxury menswear division of Li & Fung
Group, jumped 3.4 percent to HK$8.26 after agreeing to buy
Cerruti Holdings, the distributor of menswear with the same
brand name, for as 52.6 million euros ($69 million).  Rio Tinto Group , the world’s third-biggest mining company,
rose 0.5 percent to A$87.20 after offering A$3.9 billion ($3.9
billion) for Australian coking coal developer Riversdale Mining
Ltd. to gain reserves in Mozambique as demand rises. Riversdale
climbed 1.7 percent to A$16.57.  Alliance Global Group Inc. , owner of the Philippines’
largest casino and the local franchise of McDonald’s, jumped 6.3
percent to 11.80 pesos, the third-biggest advance on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index today. The company said it
will buy 60 percent of Fil-Estate Land Inc. for 5 billion pesos
($113 million) to expand its tourism-related business. Fil-
Estate surged 26 percent to 1.16 pesos.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. , India’s largest
drugmaker by market value, surged 5 percent to 452.95 rupees
after a U.S. appeals court ruled in its favor in a case
involving the cancer drug Eloxatin.  To contact the reporters on this story:
