DryShips Inc. , a Greek owner of
deep-water drilling rigs and vessels that haul iron ore and
coal, said it agreed to purchase 12 tankers for $770 million
from a Korean shipyard.  The investment into the tankers, six of which are Aframax
and the remainder Suezmax, will eventually be used in an initial
public offering or for a spinoff, Athens-based DryShips said in
a statement today.  “The tanker acquisition and eventual spin off or public
offering is the next step in the evolution of the company,”
Chief Executive Officer  George Economou  said.  Suezmax tankers can carry 876,000 to 1.46 million barrels
of oil, and Aframax vessels can move 547,500 to 876,000 barrels.
One of the Suezmax ships will be delivered next year, two in
2012 and three in 2013, DryShips said. Four of the Aframax
tankers will be delivered next year, with the other two coming
in 2012.  DryShips said that it made initial payments of about $120
million from cash on hand and that it will  finance  the
remainder, which includes delivery installments of 70 percent of
each vessel’s price, with cash and bank debt.  Economou said the Dryships’s  board  has directed the company
to “refocus” its  efforts  on the drybulk and tanker shipping
markets.  “While the tanker market is currently experiencing low
freight rates, we believe that in the medium to long term strong
oil demand growth as a result of the urbanization under way in
China and India will lead to substantially improved market
conditions,” he said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
