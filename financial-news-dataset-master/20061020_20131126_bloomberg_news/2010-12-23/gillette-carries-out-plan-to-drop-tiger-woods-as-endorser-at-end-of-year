Tiger Woods’s  endorsement deal with
 Procter & Gamble Co.’s  Gillette division will end next week as
the company follows through on a plan it announced last year.  Woods’s contract to endorse Gillette razors will end Dec.
31, company spokesman  Michael Norton  said tonight in an e-mail
message. Norton had said in December 2009 that Procter & Gamble
would begin phasing Woods out of print and TV ads for its
Gillette division.  The company will not renew its relationship with Woods as
part of a plan to phase out its Gillette Champions marketing
program in the first quarter of 2011, Norton said in an
interview earlier today with USA Today.  Gillette also will cut ties with soccer players  Thierry Henry , Kaka,  Rafael Marquez  and  Lionel Messi  and other athlete
endorsers around the world, Norton told the newspaper. Gillette
will retain endorsement ties with athletes including tennis’
 Roger Federer  and  Derek Jeter  of the New York Yankees.  “I can confirm that the contracts will run to their
completion and they will not be renewed,” Norton said in his
e-mail.  Woods also lost sponsors including  Accenture Plc  following
a November 2009 car accident that led to his admission of
extra-marital affairs and, eventually, a divorce.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Rob Gloster  in New
