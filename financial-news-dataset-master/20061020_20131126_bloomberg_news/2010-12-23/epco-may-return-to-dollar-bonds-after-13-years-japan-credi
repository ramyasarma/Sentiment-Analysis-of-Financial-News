For the first time in at least 13
years,  Tokyo Electric Power Co.  may sell dollar bonds as falling
demand cuts the size of yen-denominated offerings.  Demand for notes of Asia’s largest power company has fallen
as the central bank’s policy of near-zero interest rates drove
the average yield on five-year AA rated utility debt  below  that
of benchmark government notes for the first time in at least
five years. Bond sales by Tokyo Electric, or Tepco, have fallen
to an average of about 30 billion yen ($359 million) each this
year, from 50 billion yen in 2007 and 2008.  “We want to utilize foreign bond sales as a tool for
raising funds,” Chief Financial Officer Masaru Takei said in a
Dec. 7 interview in Tokyo. “We like to consider markets such as
these because large bond sales are possible.”  Sales of yen-denominated debt by international companies
taking advantage of the world’s lowest borrowing costs rose 34
percent this year to 1.74 trillion yen, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That sent the discount to transfer
dollar loans into yen through cross-currency interest-rate swaps
to 57 basis points, the biggest advantage in developed markets,
and spurred a fourfold gain in dollar bond sales by Japanese
companies to $17.6 billion, the data show.  Tepco’s last dollar bond sale was in June 1997, when it
raised $500 million of 10-year 7.125 percent eurobonds at a
yield 26 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries of similar
maturity. A new sale would be the first in the U.S. currency by
a non-financial company from Japan since 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Narrower Spreads  The yield spread for Tepco’s debt versus Japanese
government bonds narrowed in the last year, giving investors
less incentive to buy new securities. Ten-year notes Tepco sold
this year were priced at 7 to 9 basis points more than
government notes, down from as much as 13 basis points in 2009.  The  average yield  on five-year AA utility debt fell to 9
basis points above benchmark debt on Dec. 22, from 17 at the
start of this year, after declining to 0.1 basis point below
government yields on Nov. 15, according to Bloomberg data.  Companies raised less money this year even as they
increased the number of sales to 457, the most since Bloomberg
started keeping records in 1999. Bond sales dropped 16 percent
to 9.6 trillion yen from last year’s record 11.4 trillion yen as
slumping confidence prompted the 1,664 companies in the Topix
Index to cut capital spending in the final three months of 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Smaller Sales  Gross domestic product will shrink 1.9 percent this quarter
as Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s stimulus spending fades, the
government-affiliated Economic Planning Association said this
month, citing forecasts from economists. The world’s second-
largest economy is struggling to end deflation, an extended
decline in prices that deters investment by crimping sales
revenue and profit margins.  Tepco, rated Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service and AA by
Standard & Poor’s, sold 30 billion yen of 10-year bonds in
September priced to yield 7 basis points more than government
securities. The company, which supplies power to 28.6 million
customers, raised 235 billion yen in eight domestic sales this
year, an average 29 billion yen per issue, the smallest since at
least 1999, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The average size
has declined each year since 2007 when it raised 650 billion yen
in 12 offerings, or 54 billion yen per issue.  “The spread on utility bonds is at a historic low,” said
Yasunobu Katsuki, Mizuho Securities Co.’s chief credit analyst.
“There isn’t as much liquidity with respect to utility debt as
there used to be.”  Prepared to Pay  Tepco sold 300 million Swiss francs ($313 million) of 2.125
percent notes due in 2017 in March, its first foreign currency
bond since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in
September 2008. They were priced to yield about 14 basis points
more than the Swiss swap rate, according to Tepco. The
securities have returned 0.8 percent, while the company’s 1.73
percent 2017 yen notes gained 1.9 percent.  Tepco, which has 732 billion yen of  debt due  next year and
675 billion yen in 2012, is prepared to pay higher rates on
overseas debt to raise its profile in global bonds markets,
Takei said. “We would like to sell foreign-currency bonds once
a year,” he said.  Third-Highest Rating  The company may also turn to bank loans, Takei said. It
sold 407 billion yen of new shares in October to fund a 10-year
management plan that includes building a new nuclear power
station.  The cost to protect the company’s debt from default for
five years rose to 42 basis points on Dec. 22 from 34 at the end
of last year, after reaching an 11-month high of 58 on Feb. 11.
The Markit iTraxx Japan index of default swaps on 50 investment-
grade borrowers declined 32 basis points this year to 102. The
contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government
or company fail to meet its obligations.  Tepco forecasts profit will fall 40 percent to 80 billion
yen in the year to March 2011, while revenue will rise 7.4
percent to 5 trillion yen.  Weaker Yen  The company may return to dollar markets at a costly time
as analysts forecast the yen will weaken 12 percent next year,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 37 strategists. Japan’s
currency has depreciated 3.6 percent to 83.16 yen yesterday
since it reached a 15-year high of 80.22 in November as the
yield advantage offered by Treasuries expanded.  Ten-year Treasuries rose 55 basis points, or 0.55 percent,
this month to 3.35 percent yesterday, while Japanese government
bonds of similar maturity were at 1.135 percent on Dec. 22, a
five-basis-point decline. Japanese financial markets were closed
yesterday for a public holiday.  Sales of so-called Samurai bonds, yen-denominated debt by
borrowers outside Japan, jumped to 1.74 trillion yen this year
from 1.33 trillion yen in 2009, the biggest increase since 2007,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The increase in Samurai sales helped cut the five-year yen
basis swap to minus 63 basis points on Dec. 1, the widest since
March 2009. A negative rate means borrowers swapping dollar debt
into yen receive a discount. Borrowers typically use cross-
currency basis swaps to exchange floating-rate payments in one
currency to another.  To contact the reporters on this story:
