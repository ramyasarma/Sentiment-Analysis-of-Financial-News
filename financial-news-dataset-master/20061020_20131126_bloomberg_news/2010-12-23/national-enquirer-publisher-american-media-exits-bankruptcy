American Media Inc., the publisher
of the National Enquirer, exited bankruptcy with new financing
and restructured debt, according to  David Pecker , the company’s
chief executive officer.  The company, based in Boca Raton, Florida, will now search
for publishing properties to acquire, Pecker said in an
interview.  “I have the best capital structure for American Media
since I’ve been CEO over the last decade,” Pecker said. “I
will now be able to look for potential magazine and digital
acquisitions.”  Pecker, who has headed  American Media  since 1999, said the
company will have free cash flow of $50 million annually. In an
e-mailed statement today, he said the company exited bankruptcy
at 5 p.m. New York time yesterday.  American Media, which also publishes Star, Globe, Shape,
Muscle & Fitness and Fit Pregnancy, filed for Chapter 11
protection from its creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan in November with a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, after
attempts to  restructure its debt  failed.  American Media was hurt by a “decline in consumer spending
on publications sold at retailers’ checkout counters,” as well
as by rising prices for fuel, paper and postage, according to
court papers. It listed assets of $668 million and liabilities
of $1.23 billion in its Chapter 11 petition.  The case is In re American Media Inc., 10-16140, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
