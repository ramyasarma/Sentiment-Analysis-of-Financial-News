Frank McCourt , who is fighting his
ex-wife over ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers, objected to a
judge’s tentative decision invalidating a postnuptial agreement
that he says makes the team his sole property.  In his Dec. 7 decision, California Superior Court Judge
Scott M. Gordon incorrectly suggested that an entire paragraph
of the 2004 postnuptial would need to be severed in so far as it
dealt with a conversion of marital property that didn’t meet
requirements under California law, lawyers for McCourt said in
yesterday’s filing.  Only part of that paragraph needs to be cut and the
enforceability of the remainder of the agreement should be
reconsidered based on only that change, according to McCourt’s
filing.  Frank McCourt and his ex-wife Jamie went to trial over the
enforceability of the postnuptial agreement in September. Frank
McCourt argued that his wife sought the agreement to protect the
homes that were in her name against the liabilities he took on
to buy the Major League Baseball team in 2004.  Jamie McCourt 
testified she never knowingly would have given up her rights to
Dodgers.  Dennis Wasser, a lawyer for Jamie McCourt, said yesterday
in a phone interview that he disagrees with Frank McCourt’s
objections, which Wasser said repeat arguments already made
during the trial.  The case is McCourt v. McCourt, BD514309, Los Angeles
County Superior Court (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
