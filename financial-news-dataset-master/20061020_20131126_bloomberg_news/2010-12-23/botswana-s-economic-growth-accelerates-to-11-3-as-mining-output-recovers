Botswana’s economy expanded 11.3
percent in the third quarter from a year ago as mining output
surged following a recovery in diamond production, the Central
Statistics Office said.  Growth accelerated from a revised 4.3 percent in the second
quarter, the statistics office said today in an e-mailed
statement from the capital, Gaborone. Mining output expanded an
annual 26 percent in the third quarter from 1 percent in the
previous three months, while agriculture production surged 28
percent compared with 19 percent, the agency said.  Botswana’s manufacturing industry grew an annual 4 percent
in the third quarter, rebounding from a 2.7 percent contraction
in the previous three months, the statistics office said.
Consumer spending increased an annual 7 percent last quarter
helping to spur growth in retailing, hotels and restaurants
industry, which grew an annual 10.7 percent, up from 5.6 percent
in the second quarter, the report showed.  Botswana’s economy contracted 6 percent in 2009 following a
collapse in diamond sales that forced mines to shut for four
months. Diamond exports in the first 10 months of the year
totaled 17.2 billion pula ($2.6 billion), up from 15.2 billion
pula for all of 2009, the central bank said on Dec. 8.  The country is the world’s largest producer of diamonds,
and the government earns about half of its revenue from the gem
sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
