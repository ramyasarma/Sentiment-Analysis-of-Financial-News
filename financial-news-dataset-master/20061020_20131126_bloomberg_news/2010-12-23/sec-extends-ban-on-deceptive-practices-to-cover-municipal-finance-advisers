The Securities and Exchange
Commission  approved a rule  barring financial advisers to state
and local governments from engaging in deceptive practices, one
of the first steps to regulate the business.  The decision applies the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board’s so-called fair dealing rule to those advising officials
who oversee debt issuance and investments. It bars deceptive,
dishonest or unfair practices by bond dealers. The change takes
effect immediately, the board said today in a statement.  The rulemaking board gained power over the previously
unregulated consultants with the passage of the  Dodd-Frank  law.
Such advisers once recommended derivative trades known as swaps
that proved costly when the 2008 financial crisis struck, and
several face charges for conspiring with bankers to make local
governments pay above-market rates for investments purchased
with money raised with municipal bonds.  “The MSRB’s fair-dealing rule is an essential rule of
conduct for protecting investors in municipal securities and the
municipal entities that issue them,”  Lynnette Hotchkiss , the
board’s executive director, said in a statement. “We are
pleased that we now have this fundamental rule in place.”  Rules made by the industry’s self-regulatory organization,
based in Alexandria, Virginia, are subject to SEC review and
approval.  To contact the reporters on this story:
