Passengers in Argentina started a
fire in a Buenos Aires train station after rail service was
blocked for about six hours following a protest by workers who
were fired by a train company, newspaper Infobae reported.  Passengers threw stones and bottles against one of the
entrances to the Constitucion train station as 200 people
obstructed the normal service to protest the workers’ firing,
the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
