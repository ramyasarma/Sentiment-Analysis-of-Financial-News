Spain will reduce revenue that
photovoltaic plants may earn by 30 percent for three years, part
of a policy shift that’s forecast to trim consumer power bills
by 4.6 billion euros ($6 billion) through 2013.  Electricity producers that use solar panels will earn the
standard rate for some of the hours each day that they are
currently earning a premium, subsidized rate, missing out on 2.2
billion euros in revenue, according to an Industry Ministry
statement today.  “This is a massive blow against the Spanish photovoltaic
industry and anyone who invested in the boom,” said Solar
Analyst Francesco D’Avack of Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
“This decision could undermine investor confidence in any
renewable assets backed by government contracts.”  The package, approved by Spain’s  cabinet of ministers ,
seeks to close the tariff deficit while freezing electricity
prices for the nation’s 5 million poorest families. The
Photovoltaic Industry Assocation will challenge the decision in
court, it said in an e-mailed press release.  The deficit, or the shortfall between what power companies
are allowed to charge consumers and the revenue guaranteed to
them by the government, has spiraled in recent years. The
cabinet raised the legal limit for the tariff deficit for 2010,
2011 and 2012 by a total of 4 billion euros.  Madrid-based utility  Endesa SA , which is owed the most
money from having to cover the tariff deficit, rose 0.8 percent
to 19.47 euros in Spanish trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
