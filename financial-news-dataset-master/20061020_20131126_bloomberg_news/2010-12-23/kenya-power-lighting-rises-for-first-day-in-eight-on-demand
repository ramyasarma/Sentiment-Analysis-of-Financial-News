Kenya Power & Lighting Ltd. , the
East African nation’s sole power distributor, rose for the first
time in eight trading days on growing demand for electricity.  The stock gained 50 cents, or 2.3 percent, to 22.25
shillings as at 11:39 a.m. in Nairobi.  Kenya’s economy grew 6.1 percent in the third quarter
compared with 0.5 percent a year earlier, the Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics said in a Dec. 21 report. In that period,
there was “reliable supply of electricity and resilient
domestic demand,” it said.  “The economy is growing and this has pushed up demand for
power,”  Aly-Khan Satchu , a Nairobi-based independent stock-
market analyst, said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
