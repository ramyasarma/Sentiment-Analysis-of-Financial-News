Copper prices fell as U.S. orders
for durable goods and new-home sales in November trailed
forecasts by analysts.  Orders for durable goods fell 1.3 percent, topping a 0.5
percent decline forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. Purchases of new homes expanded at a 290,000 annual
rate, compared with 300,000 projected in another survey.
Yesterday, copper futures reached a record $4.2965 a pound.  The economic data “served as a trigger for year-end
profit-taking,”  Phil Streible , a senior strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “Trading will be quiet until
early January.”  Copper futures for March delivery fell 1.65 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $4.2585 at 12:16 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. This week, the price climbed 2.4 percent, the fourth
straight gain.  The metal has surged 48 percent since July 1, partly on
demand from emerging markets including China, the world’s
largest user.  Inventories  monitored by the London Metal Exchange rose for
the ninth straight session, signaling easing demand.  “We’re bound to see demand destruction from price-
sensitive Chinese buyers, more so because we’re currently in the
slow-consumption season,” said Yang Jun, a Beijing-based
analyst at Hongyuan Futures Co. “While the longer-term
fundamentals are supportive of prices, I do think investors
outside of China are being a bit too optimistic about China’s
demand.”  The Comex will be closed tomorrow for the Christmas
holiday.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months dropped
$50, or 0.5 percent, to $9,300 a metric ton ($4.22 a pound). On
Dec. 21, the price reached a record $9,392.  Nickel, zinc and aluminum also fell in London. Tin and lead
rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
