Russia agreed to cancel $103 million
of debt owed by Zambia, saying the southern African country
should instead use the funds for developmental projects, Radio
Phoenix reported today, citing a statement from the Russian
embassy in Lusaka.  Russia will invest as much as $27 million in an organic
fertilizer plant in 2011 to help Zambia become self-sufficient
in agriculture inputs and enable it to export these to its
neighboring countries, according to Radio Phoenix.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
