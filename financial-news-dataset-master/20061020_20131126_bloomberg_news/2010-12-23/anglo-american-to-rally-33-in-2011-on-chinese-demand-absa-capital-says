Anglo American Plc , a diversified
mining company that makes up 10 percent of South Africa’s
benchmark stock index, may rally by about 33 percent in 2011 as
Chinese commodity demand continues to rise.  “We expect a large  earnings  increase when the company
reports its 2010 accounts in February next year,” said  Chris Gilmour , an analyst at Johannesburg-based Absa Asset Management
Private Clients, which manages 5 billion rand ($735 million) of
funds. Gilmour is holding 45 percent of his funds in natural
resource stocks, compared with their weighting of about 40
percent in the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index.  Anglo American shares have climbed 7.6 percent this year in
Johannesburg trading as economic expansion in China, the world’s
largest copper user, reached 11 percent for the first three
quarters. The country is targeting economic growth of 8 percent
in 2011, and Chinese imports of refined copper, which is used in
pipes and wiring, increased for the first time in three months
in October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Economic growth in China is not going to slow down, as
some have predicted, because still far too many people are poor
there,” Gilmour said in an interview Dec. 21. Anything less
than 8 percent growth is too little for the communist
government, which fears slower economic expansion may trigger
demand for political reform, Gilmour said.  Other top natural resources picks for 2011 are BHP Billiton
Plc, the world’s largest mining company, Sasol Ltd., which
converts coal to motor vehicle fuels, Impala Platinum Holdings
Ltd. and Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., Gilmour said.  BHP, Sasol  Anglo American shares may reach 457 rand apiece in a year,
Gilmour said in an e-mail yesterday. The stock traded up 0.4
percent to 344.99 rand at 10:05 a.m. in Johannesburg today.  BHP and Sasol may each return 22 percent in the next 12
months, Gilmour said. He expects a 21 percent gain in Kumba Iron
shares in 2011.  Twenty analysts  recommend  buying Anglo American, 10 advise
holding the stock, and one says sell the shares, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s economy will keep expanding at more than 8 percent,
and “will continue to import basic metals and other commodities
from emerging markets like South Africa,” said Gilmour. “We
want to be part of that growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
