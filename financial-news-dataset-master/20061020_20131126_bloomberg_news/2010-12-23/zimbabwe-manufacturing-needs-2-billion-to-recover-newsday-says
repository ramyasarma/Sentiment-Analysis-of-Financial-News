Zimbabwe’s manufacturing industry,
which is operating at 43.7 percent capacity, needs $2 billion to
recover,  Newsday  said, citing the  Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industry  Chairman Joseph Kanyekanye.  Growth among manufacturing companies has been “sluggish”
because of electricity shortages, the high cost of borrowing and
bank charges, the Harare-based newspaper cited Kanyekanye as
saying on its website.  Zimbabwe’s economy may expand 9.3 percent in 2011, up from
8.1 percent this year, Finance Minister  Tendai Biti  said on Nov.
25. Manufacturing growth has lagged behind growth in the mining
and agricultural industries, Biti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
