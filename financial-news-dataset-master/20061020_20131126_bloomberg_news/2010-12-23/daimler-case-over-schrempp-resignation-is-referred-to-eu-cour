A German court asked European Union
judges to review several issues in a shareholder lawsuit over
the timing of  Daimler AG ’s disclosure of Chief Executive Officer
 Juergen Schrempp ’s 2005 resignation.  The Federal Court of Justice, Germany’s highest civil
tribunal, said today it needed guidance on how EU laws on
market manipulation and inside information are to be
interpreted.  “The Federal Court of Justice has therefore suspended the
proceedings and presented questions to the European Union’s
Court of Justice for an advance decision,” the court said in an
e-mailed statement.  Daimler shareholders claim the automaker didn’t disclose
Schrempp’s resignation as quickly as it should have. The
Stuttgart, Germany-based manufacturer published the former CEO’s
departure on July 28, 2005. Following the release of second-
quarter earnings and the news that Schrempp was to leave,
Daimler rose 3.16 euros, or 8.7 percent, to 39.49 euros.  Daimler’s legal spokeswoman,  Ute Vellberg , didn’t return
calls seeking comment. Wolfgang Eick, a spokesman at the
Karlsruhe-based court, also couldn’t be reached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
