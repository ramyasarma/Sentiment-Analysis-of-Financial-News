Natural gas futures declined for a
second day in three on forecasts of warmer-than-normal weather
that may reduce demand for the heating fuel and a government
report that inventories were above the seasonal average.  Gas dropped as MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather
in Rockville, Maryland, predicted temperatures 14 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal in the Midwest next week and the U.S.
Energy Department said inventories were 8.5 percent above the
five-year average for this time of year.  “There’s a lot of production and not much cold weather
right now,” said  Gordy Elliott , a risk-management specialist at
FC Stone LLC in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. “Inventories are
still way ahead of the five-year average.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 6.9 cents, or 1.7
percent, to settle at $4.083 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures are down 2.3
percent this month and 27 percent this year.  Gas futures pared losses earlier after the Energy
Department reported that inventories declined by 184 billion
cubic feet in the week ended Dec. 17 to 3.368 trillion cubic
feet. The surplus to the five-year average fell from 9.9 percent
the previous week. A deficit to year-earlier supplies widened to
1.6 percent from 0.1 percent.  The reduction in inventories was bigger than the five-year
average withdrawal for the week of 136 billion cubic feet. The
median of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg predicted a
decline of 180 billion. A survey of Bloomberg users forecast a
decrease of 179 billion.  Stockpile Estimate  Gas stockpiles will total 1.833 trillion cubic feet at the
end of the winter heating season in March, about 171 billion
cubic feet higher than at the end of March 2010, the Energy
Department said Dec. 7 in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Temperatures may be mostly normal along the East Coast next
week, MDA said. Yesterday, the company predicted colder-than-
normal weather in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic during that
period.  “The forecast has taken another step in the warmer
direction today, especially over the Midwest,” MDA forecasters
led by Travis Hartman said in a note to clients. “Guidance
continues to come into better agreement on a major warmup taking
shape in advance of a storm system developing over the Plains.”  Midwest Warmth  The low temperature in Chicago on Dec. 30 may be 28 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus-2 Celsius), 10 degrees above normal, according
to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania. The low
temperature in Minneapolis may be 20 degrees, 14 above normal.  Heating demand in the U.S. may be 1 percent below normal
from Dec. 29 through Jan. 2, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana rose 7.41 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $4.0848 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
131,572 as of 1:38 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 284,000. Volume was 243,378 yesterday. Open interest was
783,963 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
787,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
