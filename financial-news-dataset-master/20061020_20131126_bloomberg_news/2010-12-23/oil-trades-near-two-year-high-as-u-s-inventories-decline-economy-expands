Crude oil rose to the highest level
in more than two years as confidence among U.S. consumers
advanced to a six-month high, signaling that fuel demand will
increase in the biggest oil-consuming country.  Oil jumped 1.1 percent after the Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan final index of  consumer sentiment  for December
climbed to 74.5 from 71.6 in November. Americans increased
spending in November for a fifth straight month and companies
stepped up orders for equipment, signaling that the economic
recovery is accelerating.  “Today’s data supports the economy and is boosting the oil
market,” said  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover Inc.,
a trading-advisory company in New Canaan, Connecticut. “All
week we’ve wanted to move higher, either because of the rising
stock market or the improving economic outlook.”  Crude oil for February delivery advanced $1.03 to $91.51 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since Oct. 3, 2008. Prices are up 15 percent this
year. Floor trading ended at 1:30 p.m. today, an hour earlier
than usual.  Brent crude oil for February settlement increased 60 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $94.25 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The contract settled at the highest
level since Oct. 1, 2008.  Household purchases rose 0.4 percent in November after a
0.7 percent increase in October that was almost twice as large
as previously estimated, a Commerce Department report showed
today.  Incomes  climbed 0.3 percent.  Capital Goods  Bookings for goods like computers and communications gear
climbed 2.6 percent after a 3.6 percent decline in October that
was smaller than previously estimated, figures from the Commerce
Department showed today in Washington.  Total orders  dropped 1.3
percent, depressed by volatile demand for aircraft, and bookings
excluding transportation equipment rose more than forecast.  First-time filings for jobless benefits declined by 3,000
to 420,000 in the week ended Dec. 18, Labor Department figures
showed. Those already collecting benefits fell in the previous
week to 4.06 million.  Stocks were little changed. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
fell 0.2 percent to 1,256.88 at 1:38 p.m. in New York. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  rose 0.1 percent to 11,568.92.  U.S.  crude oil inventories  fell 5.33 million barrels to
340.7 million in the week ended Dec. 17, the lowest level since
February, the Energy Department reported yesterday.  “Weather in the U.S. and Europe is supportive, and we had
another big inventory drop,” said  Tobias Merath , head of
commodities at Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. “But these are
mostly temporary factors, and when these fade I see a risk we’ll
move to the mid-$80s at the beginning of next year.”  $100 Oil  Oil prices will climb to $100 a barrel,  Shokri Ghanem ,
chairman of Libya’s National Oil Corp., said, as Arab oil
ministers and officials gather in Cairo for a weekend meeting.
Ghanem told reporters that market conditions will determine
whether OPEC decides to increase production quotas next year,
without specifying a timeframe.  “Oil will reach $100” a barrel, Ghanem said.  Libya’s top oil official is in the Egyptian capital to
attend a Dec. 25 meeting of the  Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries . Seven of OAPEC’s members are also part of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  OPEC decided at its Dec. 11 meeting in Quito, Ecuador to
maintain its production target of 24.845 million barrels a day,
set in 2008. OPEC’s next meeting is scheduled for June 2011.  Reduced Shipments  The producer group will cut shipments for the first time
since October, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  The
Total  will drop 0.2 percent to 23.51 million barrels a day in
the four weeks to Jan. 8 from 23.56 million barrels in the
period ended Dec. 11, the Halifax, England-based consultant said
today in a report. The data exclude Ecuador and Angola.  “There is a drumbeat out there for higher numbers,” said
 Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York. “Can we see $100 a barrel? If we see $100 a barrel will
that be sustainable? Those are the kinds of questions that are
keeping the market higher.”  Oil volume on the Nymex was 208,125 contracts as of 1:39
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 383,058
contracts yesterday, 42 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.38 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
