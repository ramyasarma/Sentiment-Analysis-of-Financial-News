Soybeans jumped to a two-year high
on concern that dry weather may threaten crops in Brazil and
Argentina as Chinese demand increases.  Dry weather caused by a La Nina event, which has already
hurt crops, will return to Argentina from Dec. 25 and persist
through next week, according to a report from AccuWeather.com.
Brazil and Argentina are the top suppliers of soybeans and corn
after the U.S., data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
show.  “All the products are affected by reduced availability,
while demand is strong,” Bourges, France-based Offre et Demande
Agricole said on its website today. “The very high temperatures
are equally worrisome for Argentine soybeans” as they are for
corn, the farm adviser said.  Soybeans for March delivery gained 6 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $13.4575 a bushel at 10:33 a.m. London time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The price earlier touched $13.495 a bushel, the
highest level since Aug. 27, 2008. Prices have risen 28 percent
this year, partly on record Chinese demand.  Soybean imports by China, which totaled 10 million metric
tons a decade ago, may reach 57 million tons in 2010-2011,
Rabobank said in a Dec. 21 report, citing a USDA forecast. Such
a projected volume of imports is “staggering,” according to
the report.  U.S. exporters sold 110,000 tons of soybeans to China and
116,000 tons of corn to unknown buyers, the USDA said yesterday.
The corn is for delivery in the 2010-2011 marketing year, which
began Sept. 1, and the soybeans are for delivery in the
following year.  Milling Wheat Gains  Corn for March delivery was unchanged at $6.09 a bushel in
Chicago. The price earlier today reached $6.1125, the highest
level for the most-active contract since Nov. 9. Prices have
climbed 47 percent this year.  Wheat for March delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$7.815 a bushel in Chicago. The most-active contract has
advanced 44 percent this year on drought, an export ban in
Russia and concern that high-quality grain will be in deficit.  Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris gained 0.8 percent, the fifth straight gain, to 249.25
euros ($326.52) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
