Hog futures fell from a four-month
high on signs that U.S. pork supplies are increasing and demand
is slowing. Cattle were little changed.  Wholesale  pork  prices fell 0.5 percent yesterday to 77.24
cents a pound, the lowest since Dec. 6, according to government
data. On Dec. 21, hog  carcasses  averaged 207.28 pounds (94
kilograms), up 3.4 percent from a year earlier.  “There’s enough hogs around to meet the demand,” said
 Tom Cawthorne , the director of hog marketing at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates in Chicago.  Hog futures for February settlement dropped 0.15 cent, or
0.2 percent, to settle at 78.725 cents at a pound at 1:03 p.m.
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached
79.1 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since Aug.
19. The most-active contract rose 3.7 percent this week, the
biggest gain since mid-November. The exchange is closed
tomorrow for the Christmas holiday.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.025 cent to
settle at $1.07575 a pound on the CME. Yesterday, the price
