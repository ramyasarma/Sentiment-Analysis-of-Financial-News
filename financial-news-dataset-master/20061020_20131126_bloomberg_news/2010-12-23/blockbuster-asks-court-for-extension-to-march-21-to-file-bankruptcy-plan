Blockbuster Inc. , the world’s
largest movie-rental company, asked a court to extend its time
to file a reorganization plan until March 21, saying it needs to
reach consensus on a business plan for the reorganized company.  Blockbuster’s prior deadline to file a Chapter 11 plan was
Jan. 21, and it faces a March 21 deadline to solicit creditor
votes in favor of a plan. The company will ask permission to
have until May 20 to solicit creditor votes, according to papers
filed in Manhattan bankruptcy court today.  “The dynamics of the market, the importance of the
Christmas season results to the finalization of the business
plan and to the decision-making process with respect to store
closings, a consensus has not yet been achieved with respect to
the debtors’ business plan and the optimum strategic plan and
footprint for the reorganized enterprise,” lawyers for the
company wrote.  Blockbuster also asked to have more time to decide which
stores to keep, saying it needs to see if landlords at
underperforming stores will negotiate concessions of rent.  The case is In re Blockbuster, 10-14997, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
