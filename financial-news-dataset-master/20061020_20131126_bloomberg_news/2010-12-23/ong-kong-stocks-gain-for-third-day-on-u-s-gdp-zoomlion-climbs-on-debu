Hong Kong  stocks  fell, reversing
gains, as concerns about China’s scrutiny of property investment
overshadowed optimism of a global recovery after the U.S.
economy expanded faster than estimated.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., controlled by the
nation’s construction ministry, slid 1.4 percent. Li & Fung Ltd.,
the biggest supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., advanced 2.3
percent.  Changsha Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology
Development Co. , a maker of construction machinery, jumped 8
percent on its debut.  “It helps to see signs that the U.S. economic outlook looks
to be brighter in the short term, but how long this can be
sustained remains as a question,” said  Castor Pang , Hong Kong-
based research director at Cinda International Holdings Ltd.
“Markets are likely to move sideways toward the year end.
Further policy tightening may take place anytime. Developers are
particularly under selling pressure.”  The  Hang Seng Index  lost 0.6 percent to close at 22,902.97,
after rising as much as 0.5 percent. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese companies
declined 0.8 percent to 12,516.52.  The Hang Seng Index has recovered 21 percent from this
year’s low on May 25 on speculation that growth in corporate
earnings will overcome concerns about the pace of the U.S.
economic recovery and China’s steps to curb rising property
prices. Shares in the gauge trade at an average 14.4 times
estimated earnings, compared with 12.7 times on May 25.  China Overseas Land slid 1.4 percent to HK$14.60. Hang Lung
Properties Ltd., a developer of real estate in Hong Kong and
China, fell 1.5 percent to HK$36.25.  Foreign Property Investments  The Commerce Ministry ordered local authorities to halt the
approval of some foreign property investments to curb
speculative buying, it said in a Nov. 22 statement that was
posted on its website yesterday.  Li & Fung advanced 2.3 percent to HK$44.25, the biggest
gain on the Hang Seng Index. Techtronic Industries Co., maker of
Hoover vacuum cleaners and Ryobi power tools, rose 0.6 percent
to HK$10.60.  The U.S. economy grew at a revised 2.6 percent annual rate
in the third quarter, compared with a 2.5 percent estimate
issued last month, a Commerce Department report showed yesterday.  Trinity Ltd.  gained 3.4 percent to HK$8.26 after agreeing
to buy Cerruti Holdings for as much as 52.6 million euros ($69
million). Cerruti operates licensing and distribution of
menswear with the same brand name.  Both Trinity and Li & Fung Ltd. are affiliates of closely
held Li & Fung Group.  Mixed Debuts  Zoomlion climbed 8 percent to HK$16.18. The company sold
869.6 million shares at HK$14.98 each, raising net proceeds of
HK$12.5 billion ($1.6 billion) in an initial public offering,
according to a statement.  Hengxin Technology Ltd.  declined 1.3 percent to HK$2.22 on
its debut. The supplier of coaxial cables used in mobile
communications sold 98.7 million shares at HK$2.25 apiece,
raising net proceeds of HK$95 million in a Hong Kong initial
share sale.  United Energy Group Ltd. slumped 16 percent to HK$1.51
after the investment holding company said it won’t proceed with
a share placement it had been considering.  Six stocks fell for each that rose among the 45
constituents of the gauge. Its futures slid 0.9 percent to
22,894.  To contact the reporter on this story:
