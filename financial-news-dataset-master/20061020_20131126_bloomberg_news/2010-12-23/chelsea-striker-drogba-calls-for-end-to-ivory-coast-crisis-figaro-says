Chelsea soccer striker  Didier Drogba 
called for national unity and an end to the political stand-off
in Ivory Coast, where he captains the national team, French
newspaper Le Figaro reported.  Ivory Coast’s people would suffer if the country was split
into north and south again, Drogba was citing as saying by the
Paris-based newspaper.  Laurent Gbagbo  has refused to heed international calls to
step down as head of Ivory Coast even after he lost Nov. 28
elections, which were supposed to end eight years of division in
the West African country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
