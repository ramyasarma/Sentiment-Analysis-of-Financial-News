Kenyan lawmakers yesterday approved
names of members of the Commission on the Implementation of the
Constitution and the Commission for Revenue Allocation, the
Nairobi-based Daily Nation reported, citing parliamentary
proceedings.  The deadline for approval of the nominees lapsed last month
after lawmakers rejected the members over a dispute on creation
of new electoral boundaries, the newspaper said. The lawmakers
have since accepted a report on creation of new electoral units,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
