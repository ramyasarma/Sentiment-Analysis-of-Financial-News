California, facing $28 billion in
deficits, may see its congressional clout wane as slowing
population growth deprives it of a new seat in the U.S. House of
Representatives for the first time in its 160-year history.  The  U.S. Census Bureau  reported this week that California’s
population climbed 10 percent in the last decade to 37.3 million
people, its slowest rate ever. The Golden State’s growth cooled
because of souring housing prices, technology-industry job
losses and lower levels of migration. That may translate into
less influence in the nation’s capitol.  The state with the biggest population still controls the
most seats in the House, 53 of 435.  Reapportionment  based on
2010 Census data will narrow the gap between  California  and
faster-growing southern and western states such as  Texas , which
picked up four seats to 36.  “We’ve always gained a seat -- just staying even is a bit
of a shock,” Douglas Johnson, a fellow at the Rose Institute of
State and Local Government at  Claremont McKenna College  in
Claremont, said in a telephone interview. “California never
likes to think of itself as average in anything, and now we’re
average in population growth.”  Congressional power has consequences. The budget that
Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  and lawmakers enacted in October
after a record 100-day impasse relies on $5.3 billion in federal
funds for welfare, education and prison costs. Schwarzenegger,
who last year said he would get $7 billion from the federal
government, was forced to cut that estimate in half after
officials in  Washington  wouldn’t commit to the money.  ‘Disappointing Number’  “It’s a bit of a disappointing number, as you want more
political power and you want more federal funds flowing to your
state,” said Hans Johnson, director of research at the  Public
Policy Institute of California  in  San Francisco . “It wasn’t a
good number for California.”  California, home to 14 percent of the companies in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index including  Apple Inc .,  Google Inc .
and  Cisco Systems Inc ., was hit hard by the dot-com bust in 2000
that triggered job cuts across Silicon Valley. The state remains
mired in 12.4 percent unemployment, higher than the 9.8 percent
national rate in November.  The state’s largest industries by revenue are technology,
consumer services and oil and gas, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. All lost ground in the recession. The state’s biggest
employer,  Hewlett-Packard Co ., the world’s largest maker of
personal computers, announced in June that it was cutting 9,000
jobs in a restructuring.  Lost Tech Jobs  Silicon Valley  lost  more than 108,000 technology jobs from
2000 to 2008, the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  said in the
January edition of the Monthly Labor Review. Wages for the
Valley’s technology workers dropped 16 percent from 2000 to
2004, then gained 4.4 percent through mid-2009, the bureau said.  With the jobs chill, California estimates only 67,000
people migrated to the state this year, one-fifth the number
earlier in the decade. Its population rose to 37,253,956 on
April 1, from 33,871,648 10 years earlier, Census figures show.  While California has long been attractive to international
migrants who come to California from such places as  India  to
work in the technology industry, more residents have moved out
recently than have moved in from other states, Johnson said. In
part, that’s because of California’s comparatively high
unemployment rate and high cost of living, he said.  “What this Census number suggests is that the
international immigrants that we have received have been offset
by domestic migration losses to other states,” Johnson said.  Demographic Change  The decade also witnessed a decline in the state’s Anglo-
American population to 40.8 percent by 2008 from 47.2 percent in
2000, according to data from the California Finance Department’s
demographics office. The state’s Latino population grew to 37.2
percent in 2008 from 32.5 percent at the turn of the century.  California’s expensive housing market also contributed to
the slowing in population growth, said Stephen Levy, director of
the  Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy  in  Palo Alto .  The median price of a previously occupied home in
California had reached $480,820 by December 2007, according to
the California Association of Realtors. That was twice the
$207,100 national median at the time, according to data from the
National Association of Realtors. Since then, the California
median has  fallen  to $296,820 in November, though that’s still
more than 40 percent higher than the $170,600 national median.  “The housing price differential that’s built up over the
past 20 years has contributed to the growth rate slowing in
California,” Levy said in a telephone interview.  High Foreclosure Rates  Seven of the 10 U.S. cities with the highest home-
foreclosure rates in November were in California, according to
 RealtyTrac Inc. , an Irvine, California-based data company.  California ranks 15th compared with other states in taxes
and fees paid from every $100 of personal income, according to
the state Finance Department. While not as high as places such
as  New York  and  Delaware , the rate has spurred people to leave
for nearby states such as  Nevada , which ranks 28th.  Congressional districts are  redrawn  every 10 years after
completion of the census, with each to have roughly the same
number of people. After the 2000 census, each House lawmaker was
supposed to represent about 647,000 people. That number will now
grow to about 710,000, the Census Bureau said.  California gained  House  seats following every census since
the state was admitted into the Union in 1850 except in 1920,
when Congress couldn’t agree on a formula to divvy up the seats.
As a result, it failed to change any state’s apportionment.  California voters in November passed a ballot measure
stripping state lawmakers of their power to draw the boundaries
of congressional districts. Instead, a Citizens Redistricting
Commission made up of five Republicans, five Democrats and four
members who aren’t from either party will use the latest census
data to redraw the state’s congressional districts.  The population of the U.S. rose 9.7 percent since 2000 to
308,745,538 on April 1, the slowest pace of growth since 1930-
1940, according to Census figures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
