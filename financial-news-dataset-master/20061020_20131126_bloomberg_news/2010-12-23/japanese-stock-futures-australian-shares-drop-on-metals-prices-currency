Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian shares fell as metal prices declined and the dollar
weakened against the yen, damping the outlook for export
earnings.  American depositary receipts of Nissan Motor Co., a
Japanese carmaker that earns about 75 percent of its revenue
overseas, lost 1.1 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo
on Dec. 22. Those of Canon Inc., a Japanese camera maker that
gets about 80 percent of its sales abroad, sank 1.3 percent. BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest mining company, retreated 0.9
percent in Sydney today.  “The stronger yen will likely lead investors to sell
shares to lock in profits,” said  Juichi Wako , a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,275 in Chicago yesterday, compared with the
gauge’s close of 10,346.48 in Tokyo on Dec. 22. Japanese markets
were shut yesterday for a holiday. Futures were bid in the pre-
market at 10,280 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time today.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index decreased 0.1 percent. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.2 percent.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. The index fell 0.2 percent yesterday in New York, after
a five-day rally.  Stronger Yen  The dollar depreciated to as low as 82.86 against the yen
yesterday in New York, the weakest level since Dec. 14. The euro
weakened to 108.46 against the Japanese currency yesterday, near
the lowest level this month. That reduces the value of overseas
income at Japanese companies when converted into their home
currency.  Copper futures for March delivery fell 0.4 percent
yesterday in New York. The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six
metals including copper and aluminum, slipped 0.8 percent
yesterday, dropping for a second consecutive day.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 13 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 13 percent by the S&P
500 and 11 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.9 times estimated earnings on
average at yesterday’s close, versus 14.7 times for the S&P 500
and 12.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
