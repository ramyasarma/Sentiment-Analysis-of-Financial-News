Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc , a South
African developer of shafts for underground mines, rose 8
percent on its London trading debut today.  The stock opened at 132 pence, more than 6 percent above
its 124 pence placement price, and rose to 134 pence as of 2:04
p.m. in London, valuing the company at 63.7 million pounds ($98
million).  Shaft Sinkers, which built its business in South Africa
where some of the world’s deepest mining shafts are located,
said it will use the capital to expand into new industries and
countries including India.  “The directors of Shaft Sinkers believe that global demand
for shaft sinking will continue to grow as a result of the
depletion of surface and shallow mineral ore bodies, growing
environmental pressures and growth in alternative end-market
applications,” the company said in its prospectus published on
Dec. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
