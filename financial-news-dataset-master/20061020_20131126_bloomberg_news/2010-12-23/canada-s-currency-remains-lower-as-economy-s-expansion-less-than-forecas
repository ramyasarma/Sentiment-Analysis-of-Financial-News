Canada’s dollar fell versus its
commodity-linked counterparts after a report showed the nation’s
economic expansion trailed forecasts, adding to evidence its
recovery may be protracted.  The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie, strengthened
against the greenback as crude oil surged to the highest level
in more than two years. The loonie headed for a 0.5 percent gain
on the week, after falling in the previous two. It has risen 4.3
percent this year versus the U.S. dollar, the ninth-best
performance among its 16 major counterparts.  The U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar currency pair “has been
less in tune with risk-seeking sentiment,”  Brian Kim , a
currency strategist at UBS AG in Stamford, Connecticut, said via
e-mail. “It’s probably the choppiness in the Canadian and U.S.
data that’s batting around the pair.”  Canada’s dollar dropped 0.5 percent to 75.42 Canadian cents
per New Zealand dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 75.01 cents
yesterday, and declined 0.2 percent to C$1.0138 per Australian
dollar, from C$1.0122. Australia and New Zealand, like Canada,
rely on raw materials for export revenue.  The loonie gained 0.4 percent to C$1.0095 per U.S. dollar,
from C$1.0132 yesterday, after earlier depreciating as much as
0.3 percent. It touched C$1.0209 per greenback on Dec. 20, the
weakest level since Dec. 1.  Canadian  gross domestic product  grew 0.2 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of C$1.24 trillion ($1.22
trillion) in October following a 0.1 percent contraction in
September, the nation’s statistics agency said today in Ottawa.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 0.3 percent
gain, based on the median of 21 forecasts.  Bonds Decline  Crude oil for February delivery climbed as much as 1.3
percent to $91.63 a barrel in New York, the highest level since
October 2008. Crude is Canada’s biggest export. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent.  Government bonds fell, pushing the yield on the  two-year
note  up as much as five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 1.72 percent, the highest level in a week. It touched 1.76
percent on Dec. 13, the highest since Nov. 25. The price of the
1.5 percent security maturing in December 2012 decreased 6 cents
to C$99.64.  Canada’s dollar, called the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, will strengthen to parity with the
greenback by the end of March, and trade there for most of 2011,
according to the median forecast of 33 economists and analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  New Zealand Dollar  New Zealand’s currency was the top performer among the
greenback’s major counterparts. The U.S. dollar fell against
most peers after reports showed the American economic recovery
is gaining momentum, encouraging demand for higher-yielding
assets. Data showed household spending and orders for capital
equipment rose in November and initial claims for unemployment
insurance benefits fell last week.  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said next year’s
budget will contain measures to help bolster economic growth
while adhering to the longer-term goal of a balanced budget.  Extending worker training programs and “significant”
infrastructure spending will be part of Canada’s 2011 budget,
Flaherty said in a Dec. 21 interview with Bloomberg News. Still,
returning the country’s finances to balance will “anchor” the
fiscal plan, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
