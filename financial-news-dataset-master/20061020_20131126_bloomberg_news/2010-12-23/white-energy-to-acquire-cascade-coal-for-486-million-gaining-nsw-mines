White Energy Co. , an Australian coal
company, said it is advancing with plans to acquire Cascade Coal
Pty for A$486 million ($486 million) in shares and cash to add
new projects in New South Wales state and increase output.  The transaction would give Sydney-based White Energy
control of the Mt. Penny thermal coal project, which is expected
to produce as much as 3.8 million metric tons a year starting in
2013, rising to 6.5 million tons a year by 2018, the company
said in a statement today to the Australian stock exchange.  Australian coal acquisitions have “reduced the
availability of quality coal projects, increased competition for
assets and driven appreciating coal valuations,” White Energy
said. Cascade is a “compelling opportunity,” it said.  White Energy said it will pay at most A$41 million in cash
and the rest in stock. The shares issued to Cascade will be the
lower of A$3.85 or the 15-day, volume-weighted average price
prior to the completion of the deal, while the transaction now
has a “floor” price of A$3.50 a share, the company said.  White Energy  fell 0.9 percent to A$3.37 at 10:58 a.m. in
Sydney trading, valuing the company at A$1.04 billion. The
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.2 percent.  Shareholders are due to vote on the deal in March after a
final agreement is signed by the end of January. White Energy
would also assume liabilities of A$14 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
