China’s benchmark money-market rate
surged to a three-year high, on speculation a shortage of funds
will worsen as banks hoard cash before the New Year holiday.  The  seven-day repurchase rate  rallied even after the
central bank pumped a total of 26 billion yuan ($3.9 billion) of
capital into the financial market this week, a sixth net weekly
 injection , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Policy
makers on Dec. 10 ordered lenders to park more money with the
central bank for the third time in five weeks to limit inflation.  “Banks are collecting money to prepare for cash-withdrawal
demand during the holiday and to meet the loan-to-deposit ratio
requirement at the end of each month,” said  Liu Junyu , a
Shenzhen-based bond analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the
nation’s sixth largest lender. “Every one is badly short of
money after making the payments for the reserve ratio hike on
Monday.”  The seven-day repo rate, which measures lending costs
between banks, jumped 150 basis points to 5.67 percent, the
highest level since October 2007, according to a daily fixing
published at 11 a.m. by the National Interbank Funding Center.
That was the biggest daily gain since June 2008.  The People’s Bank of China sold 1 billion yuan of three-
month bills at a yield of 1.8131 percent in  open-market
operations , unchanged for a sixth straight week, according to a
statement on its website.  The yield on the 3.28 percent government bond due October
2020 rose 3.5 basis points to 3.80 percent, Interbank Funding
Center data show. One-year interest-rate swaps, or the fixed
cost needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate,
climbed eight basis points to 3.15 percent.  The yuan was little changed at 6.6431 per dollar as of 4:30
p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent
to 6.5043 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency will
strengthen 2.2 percent in one year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Sandy Hendry ,  Dirk Beveridge   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
