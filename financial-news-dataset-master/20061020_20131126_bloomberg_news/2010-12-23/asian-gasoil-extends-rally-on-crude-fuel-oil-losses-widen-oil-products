Asia gasoil swaps rallied to the
highest in 26 months as crude futures climbed above $90 a barrel
in New York. Fuel oil’s crack spread widened, signaling
increased losses from making the residue.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil , or diesel, swaps for January rose 20 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $104.45 a barrel at 11:40 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates, a brokerage. That’s
the highest since Oct. 3, 2008.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, the Asian benchmark,
decreased 6 cents to $13.88 a barrel, PVM said. This  crack
spread , a measure of refining profit, has lost 10 percent since
climbing to $15.43 on Dec. 7, the widest since January 2009.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising
yesterday to $1.40 a barrel, the highest since Dec. 2, according
to PVM data. A wider  regrade  shows it’s more profitable for
refiners to produce aviation fuel than diesel.  Fuel Oil  January  high-sulfur fuel oil  swaps were unchanged from
yesterday at $517.75 a metric ton, according to PVM. The
product’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 26 cents to $10.91 a
barrel, indicating processing losses were the steepest since
January 2009.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after declining to $10 a ton, PVM said. This
 viscosity spread  is up 25 percent from $8 at the end of
November, signaling bunker, or marine fuel, has lagged gains in
higher-quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for first-half February delivery were bid at $876.50 a
ton against offers at $879.50, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. That’s up from yesterday’s close of
$869.75.  Naphtha’s crack spread to Brent crude dropped for a second
day, falling $1.43 to $162.76 a ton, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The difference has narrowed about 5 percent from
$171.18 at the end of November.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday rebounded to $7.10
a barrel, Bloomberg calculations showed. This  reforming margin 
was at the widest in about a week, meaning motor fuel production
was more profitable relative to naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
