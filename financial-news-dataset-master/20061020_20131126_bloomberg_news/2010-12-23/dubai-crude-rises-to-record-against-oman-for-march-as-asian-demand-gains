Dubai  crude, a Persian Gulf
benchmark for Asia, will sell at a record price relative to its
regional marker as demand for Middle East oil rises.  The official selling price for Dubai oil loading in March
will be at parity to Oman futures, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange . That’s up 10
cents a barrel from February and is the first time Dubai isn’t
discounted to Oman since the two grades were priced together in
September 2009.  Middle East crude has risen on increased demand in Asia,
the biggest market for the region’s producers. Refiners in
China, which overtook the U.S. last year as the world’s largest
crude user, processed a record 8.96 million barrels a day last
month, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said last week.  The Dubai Mercantile Exchange, where Oman futures contracts
are traded two months forward, provided today’s price
announcement from Dubai’s Department of Petroleum Affairs. The
department issues its price formula on the last Thursday of
every month. The final price for March will be set on the last
trading day for that month’s contract, when the official selling
price of Oman crude is also calculated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
