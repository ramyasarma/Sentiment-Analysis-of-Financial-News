Canadian stocks fell for the first
time in three days as railroads and insurers dropped after the
country reported slower economic growth than most economists
forecast.    Manulife Financial Corp ., North America’s fourth-largest
insurer, decreased 1.2 percent after  Statistics Canada  said
gross domestic product increased 0.2 percent in October.  Canadian National Railway Co ., the country’s biggest railroad,
lost 0.9 percent.  Agrium Inc ., Canada’s second-largest
fertilizer producer, rose 1.7 percent as soybean futures
advanced to a 28-month high.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 9.5
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,371.20.  “In Canada, we raised rates earlier this year. The high
dollar is having a little bit of an impact,” said Robert Floyd,
president of BirchLeaf Investments Inc., who says his growth
oriented investments for clients soared 56 percent last year and
an additional 22 percent this year through Nov. 30. He declined
to disclose his assets under management. Growth “is not robust.
It’s just kind of moving along slowly.”  The S&P 500 has outgained the S&P/TSX, 14 percent to 10
percent, since Sept. 3, the trading day before the Bank of
Canada raised its benchmark interest rate to 1 percent from 0.75
percent. The Canadian dollar has climbed 4.2 percent this year
to 99.08 U.S. cents.  Trails Forecast  Canadian October economic growth of 0.2 percent trailed the
