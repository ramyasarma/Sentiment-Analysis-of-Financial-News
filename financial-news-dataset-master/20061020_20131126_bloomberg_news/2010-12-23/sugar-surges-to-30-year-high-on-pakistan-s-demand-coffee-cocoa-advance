Sugar jumped to a 30-year high as
Pakistan said it may import 700,000 metric tons to ease domestic
shortages. Coffee, cocoa and orange juice also gained.  Sugar production in Pakistan “will reach 3.3 million
tons” in the year ending June 30, short of demand at 4.2
million tons, Farm Minister Nazar Muhammad Gondal said. Record
rainfall in Australia, the world’s third-largest exporter, will
curb production and shipments next season for a second year,
 Queensland Sugar Ltd.  said.  “The fundamentals have given the market direction this
year, so any sort of news like that coming out of Pakistan is
icing on the cake,” said  Connor Noonan , an analyst at
Castlestone Management Ltd. in London. “When we see countries
are going to need to import, there is a fear that we’re
struggling to find the actual physical” sugar, he said.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.85 cent, or 2.6
percent, to settle at 33.98 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Future U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached 34.06 cents,
the highest for a most-active contract since November 1980. The
commodity has gained 26 percent this year.  The exchange is closed tomorrow for the Christmas holiday.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery climbed
$36.40, or 4.6 percent, to $820.90 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Shipments by Queensland Sugar, which accounts for more than
90 percent of Australia’s exports, may be 2.7 million to 2.8
million tons in the year that begins July 1, compared with 2.3
million tons this season and typical levels of 3 million tons,
Chairman Alan Winney said today.  Coffee Rises  Arabica coffee rose, capping the fourth straight weekly
gain, on speculation that supplies may be curbed because of
heavy rains in India and Brazil.  India will miss a forecast to harvest a record crop after
wet weather damaged plants and delayed harvests in the biggest
growing region, the nation’s Coffee Board said this week. Coffee
trees in Brazil, the largest producer, may be harmed by fungus
after downpours, Somar Meteorologia, a weather forecaster, said
this week.  Arabica futures for March delivery climbed 5.7 cents, or
2.5 percent, to $2.359 a pound on ICE. Yesterday, the price
reached $2.4225, the highest since June 1997. The commodity
gained 4.7 percent this week and is up 74 percent in 2010.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for March delivery were
little changed at $2,011 a ton.  On ICE, cocoa futures for March delivery rose $50, or 1.7
percent, to $3,020 a ton. The commodity has gained 7.6 percent
this month as civil unrest following elections in Ivory Coast,
the biggest grower, disrupted exports. The price is down 8.2
percent this year.  In London, cocoa futures for March delivery rose 31 pounds,
or 1.5 percent, to 2,040 pounds ($3,146) a ton.  Orange Juice Climbs  Orange-juice futures for March delivery gained 1.2 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $1.6395 pound in New York.  The price gained for the sixth straight session, the
longest rally since early November. Orange crops in California,
the second-biggest U.S. producer, may be damaged following
torrential rains, a government official said yesterday.  The commodity has advanced 27 percent this year. Brazil is
the world’s leading producer, followed by Florida.  To contact the reporters on this story:
