European gasoil futures traded at a
the highest level in more than two years on London’s ICE Futures
Europe Exchange as freezing weather increased demand.  Vitol Group sold a 30,000-ton jet fuel cargo to BP Plc,
according to a Bloomberg survey. Gasoline barges advanced.  Light Products  Premium gasoline gained as Trafigura Beheer BV bought on
the barge market, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window.  Deals were done from $860 to $862 a metric ton, the survey
showed. Yesterday’s highest price was $856 a ton. So-called
barge deals are usually for 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Eurobob grade  gasoline barges for immediate loading in
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp changed hands at $832 to $837 a ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with deals at $828 to $831
yesterday. Ethanol is added to Eurobob to make finished motor
fuel.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, used in heating, advanced as stockpiles in
northwest Europe fell to the lowest level in a month.  Inventories of the fuel in independent storage fell 4.5
percent to 2.78 million metric tons in the week to today,
according to PJK International BV, an industry consultant. The
gasoil figure includes heating fuel and diesel.  “Because of the cold spell, there is some demand from
local traders in Germany, France and Switzerland,” Pieter
Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by phone from Oosterhout, the
Netherlands, where the company is based.  Gasoil for January delivery advanced as much as $5.50, or
0.7 percent, to $786.50 a ton on ICE, the highest intraday price
since Oct. 9, 2008. The contract traded at $785.50 as of 5:28
p.m. London time.  Vitol sold jet fuel to BP for delivery to Rotterdam from
Jan. 2 to Jan. 6 at a $64 premium to January ICE gasoil, the
survey showed.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil, used to power ships, traded from $487
a ton to $489 a ton. Low-sulfur fuel oil, used in shipping and
power stations, traded at $500 a ton, the survey showed.  Refinery News  Total SA suffered an electrical fault in a plastics-
production unit at its Feyzin refinery in France yesterday,
prompting the company to burn off material through flaring,
according to Lyon.fr, a French news website.  Michael Crochet-Vourey, a Total spokesman in Paris,
declined to comment when asked about the report.  Refiners in Europe will idle less capacity than usual in
the first quarter as profits rise to the highest level in two
years, according to analysts and data compiled by Bloomberg
News.  At least 516,000 barrels of oil a day, or 3.3 percent of
Europe’s refining capacity, will be idled for maintenance, the
Bloomberg data show. That compares with a five-year average of
555,000 barrels a day, according to Roy Jordan, a consultant at
Facts Global Energy in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
