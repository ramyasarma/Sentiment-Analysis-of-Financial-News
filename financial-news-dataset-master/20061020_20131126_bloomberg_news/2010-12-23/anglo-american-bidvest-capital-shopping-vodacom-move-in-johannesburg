South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  rose 68.34, or 0.2 percent, to 32,127.31 at the 5
p.m. close in Johannesburg. The benchmark gauge has climbed 6.2
percent this month and 16 percent in 2010.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock
index, fell for the first time in almost two weeks, losing 1.28
rand, or 0.4 percent, to 342.50 rand. The company’s stock was
downgraded to “sell” from “reduce” by AlphaValue equity
analyst  Pranav Kumar .  Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc  (CSO SJ), the U.K.’s
biggest shopping mall owner, declined for a fourth day, falling
8 cents, or 0.2 percent, to 43.50 rand. Simon Property Group
Inc. will probably wait until January before deciding whether to
raise its indicative offer of 425 pence a share for the U.K.
company, or to drop the bid, the London-based Times reported,
citing unidentified people close to the situation.  The Bidvest Group Ltd.  (BVT SJ), a diversified investment
group with assets in financial services and auto dealerships,
declined for the second day in three, weakening 15 cents, or 0.1
percent, to 159 rand. The company bought fresh fish producer and
distributor Seafood Holdings Ltd. for an enterprise value of 45
million pounds ($69.2 million), it said late yesterday.  Vodacom Group Ltd.  (VOD SJ), the largest provider of
mobile-phone services to South Africans, retreated for the
fourth day, losing 70 cents, or 0.9 percent, to 74.20 rand.
Shameel Joosub, the managing director of the group’s South
African unit, will be resigning to take up a post as chief
executive officer of Vodafone Spain, Vodacom said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
