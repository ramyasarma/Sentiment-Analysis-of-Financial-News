Quarterback Terrelle Pryor was among
five Ohio State University football players suspended for the
first five games of next season after selling awards, gifts and
university apparel and receiving other benefits, the school said
on its  Web site .  Pryor, a junior who has  scored  55 touchdowns and accounted
for almost 6,000 yards in his career for the sixth-ranked
Buckeyes, and the others will be eligible to play in the Sugar
Bowl against No. 8 Arkansas on Jan. 4 in New Orleans.  Pryor, offensive lineman  Michael Adams , running back  Dan
Herron , wide receiver  DeVier Posey  and defensive end  Solomon
Thomas  must give a charity between $1,000 and $2,500 each to
offset the value of the discounted services they received.  A sixth player, linebacker  Jordan Whiting , was suspended
for the first game of 2011 and must pay $150 to a charity for
receiving discounted services.  “These are significant penalties based on findings and
information provided by the university,”  Kevin Lennon , the
National Collegiate Athletic Association’s vice president of
academic and membership affairs, said in a  statement .  The players will miss games against Akron; Toledo; the
University of Miami of Coral Gables, Florida; Colorado; and
Michigan State.  Lennon  said the players weren’t provided with adequate
instruction on the rules. Ohio State Athletic Director  Gene Smith  said in the statement that the school was “not as
explicit with our student-athlete education as we should have
been in the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 academic years regarding the
sale of apparel, awards and gifts issued by the athletics
department.”  Tighten Instruction  Smith said instruction had been tightened up beginning in
November 2009 and would be further enhanced “after going
through this experience.”  Adams must repay $1,000 for selling his 2008 Big Ten
championship ring, and Herron must repay $1,150 for selling his
football jersey, pants and shoes for $1,000 and receiving
discounted services worth $150, according to the statement.  Posey must repay $1,250 for selling his 2008 championship
ring for $1,200 and receiving discounted services worth $50,
while Pryor must repay $2,500 for selling his 2008 championship
ring, a 2009 Fiesta Bowl sportsmanship award and his 2008 Gold
Pants, a gift from the university.  Solomon must repay $1,505 for selling his 2008 championship
ring for $1,000, his 2008 Gold Pants for $350 and receiving
discounted services worth $155.  To contact the reporter on this story:
