Citgo Petroleum Corp. will shut a
fluid catalytic cracker for about 40 days of work starting in
early January at its Lake Charles  refinery  in Louisiana,
according to two people familiar with the plans.  Cat cracker B will be shut for maintenance, said one of the
people, who declined to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak for the company. Extensive work, including
the changing of the unit’s catalyst, is scheduled, said the
other person.  Fernando Garay , a company spokesman, declined to comment.  A turnaround on the B cat cracker is scheduled for 2011,
according to a filing made with the Louisiana Department of
Environmental Quality. A turnaround on cat cracker C is
scheduled in 2012, according to the filing.  The refinery operates three cat crackers, each with a
capacity of about 50,000 barrels a day, one of the people said.
The units are operating at approximately 45,000 barrels of
capacity now, according to the person.  The refinery has a capacity of 440,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The plant can produce
about 186,000 barrels of gasoline and 95,000 barrels of diesel
fuel a day, according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
