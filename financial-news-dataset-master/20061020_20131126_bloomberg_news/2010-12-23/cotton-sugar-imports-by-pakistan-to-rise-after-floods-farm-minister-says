Pakistan  may import 700,000 metric
tons of sugar and 4 million bales of cotton to ease shortages
and cool prices after the country’s worst-ever floods damaged
standing crops, the country’s farm minister said.  “Sugar production will reach 3.3 million tons,” against
an annual demand of 4.2 million tons, said  Nazar Muhammad Gondal 
in an interview in Islamabad. Cotton output may total 11 million
bales, less than the 15 million bales required, he said.  Increased purchases by Pakistan may worsen global supply
shortages that have made cotton and sugar the best performers
this year among 19 materials in the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index. The floods caused $9.7 billion in damage, according
to the Asian Development Bank, including $3.3 billion in terms
of crop losses, Gondal said.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed as much as 1.4 percent
to 33.59 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S., nearing the highest
in almost three decades. White sugar in London advanced the most
in eight days. March-delivery cotton reached a record $1.5912 a
pound on Dec. 21.  Prices  have doubled this year.  Gondal’s sugar-import forecast exceeds the 600,000 tons
predicted this month by the Sindh Abadgar Board, a grower’s
group. The government Sept. 16 said the country would face a
deficit of 1.2 million tons next year. Pakistan has bought 1.2
million tons for calendar 2010.  The country’s cotton exports this year may total 600,000
bales of 170 kilograms (375 pounds) each, from 800,000 bales,
according to the Karachi Cotton Brokers’ Association.  Rice Fields  Pakistan’s rice exports will decline after flood waters
washed away fields, Gondal said.  “We lost our entire exportable crop in the province of
Sindh,” he said, predicting shipments may drop to 1.5 million
tons from 4 million tons last year.  Exports from July 1 to Dec. 12 were 1.5 million tons valued
at $820 million, the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan said
Dec. 14. The group expects to sell as much as $2.2 billion worth
of the grain, matching last year’s receipts, it said.  Exporters are marketing rice from the previous year’s crop,
while this year’s stockpiles will be limited, Gondal said.  Still, the floods have helped refresh farmlands at several
placed across the country and yield from those farms is likely
to improve with better, more fertile soil and availability of
water in the next season, an analyst said.  ‘Self-Sufficient’  “The floods will help Pakistan achieve self-sufficiency in
food in the year ending June” because of increased fertility,
said Muhammad Ali Kazmi, head of commodities at Invest Capital
and Securities. “Crops will give a bounty.”  Pakistan may become self-sufficient in wheat, said Gondal.
Output may total 23 million tons, compared with the government’s
estimate of 24 million tons and annual consumption of 22 million
tons, he said. A unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture on
Dec. 14 predicted a harvest of 23.9 million tons.  The government Dec. 7 lifted a ban on exports of the grain,
prompting estimates the country would ship as much as 2 million
tons in the year ending June. Gondal didn’t say how much wheat
will be sold abroad.  The country hopes to lower its edible-oil import bill from
$1.7 billion by asking farmers to increase the area planted with
sunflower and canola, Gondal said.  “We have covered 1.1 million acres with sunflower seeds
and another 100,000 acres with canola. We hope the growth will
reduce the edible oil bill by $700 million dollars,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
