Wheat in South Africa advanced as
prices climbed in the U.S., which competes for African export
markets.  Wheat for March delivery, the most active contract on the
South African Futures Exchange, added 24 rand, or 0.9 percent,
to 2,854 rand ($421) a metric ton at 9:32 a.m. in Johannesburg.  U.S. wheat futures for March delivery advanced as much as
0.6 percent to $7.88 a bushel in electronic trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the highest price in almost two weeks,
and traded recently at $7.8675. Prices have advanced 45 percent
this year on drought in Russia and concern that high-quality
grain will be in deficit.  White corn for March delivery gained 11 rand, or 0.8
percent, to 1,382 rand a ton in Johannesburg. Meal made from the
grain is the country’s staple food.  Yellow corn for March delivery advanced 15 rand, or 1
percent, to 1,457 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
