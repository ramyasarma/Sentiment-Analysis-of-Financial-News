Kenyan lawmakers passed a motion
yesterday urging the East African nation to withdraw from the
Rome Statute that created the  International Criminal Court , the
Daily Nation  reported , citing parliamentary proceedings.  The non-binding motion said the six people named by ICC
Chief Prosecutor  Luis Moreno-Ocampo  as being responsible for
crimes during post-election violence in 2008 should be tried in
Kenya, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  Only one lawmaker at the parliamentary session, former
Justice Minister  Martha Karua , voted against the motion, the
Daily Nation said.  Ocampo on Dec. 15 requested that charges of crimes against
humanity be filed against Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta , and lawmaker  William Ruto .
Industrialization Minister  Henry Kosgey , Cabinet Secretary
 Francis Muthaura , former police chief Mohammed Hussein Ali and
Joshua Arap Sang, a radio presenter, were also identified as
suspects.  To contact the reporters on this story:
