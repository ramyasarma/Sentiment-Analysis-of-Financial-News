Builders sold fewer new homes than
forecast in November, signaling the U.S. housing market is
floundering in the face of near-10 percent unemployment and an
overhang of unsold existing properties.  Purchases increased 5.5 percent to a 290,000 annual rate
from a 275,000 pace in October that was lower than previously
estimated, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
Washington. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected a 300,000 pace. Sales reached a 274,000
pace in August, the lowest since data collection began in 1963.  Unemployment  hovering near the highest level in 26 years and
a backlog of distressed properties on the market may restrain
sales of new homes into the new year. Foreclosure moratoriums and
state probes into evictions mean lenders may tighten borrowing
rules more, further weakening demand.  “Housing is bouncing along the bottom,” said Ward
McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies & Co. Inc. in
New York. “The worst is over, but the bad news is it’s still
going to take years until we get a recovery.”  Other Commerce Department reports today showed consumer
spending rose in November for a fifth month and orders for
capital equipment, like computers and telecommunications gear,
rebounded. Figures from the Labor Department showed the number of
claims for jobless benefits dropped, reinforcing evidence the
labor market is improving.  Spending Gains  Household purchases advanced 0.4 percent after a 0.7 percent
gain in October that was larger than previously estimated.
Incomes rose 0.3 percent and the Federal Reserve’s preferred
price measure showed inflation remained below policy makers’
comfort zone.  Orders  for long-lasting goods like computers climbed 2.6
percent after a 3.6 percent decline in October that was smaller
than previously estimated.  Total orders  dropped 1.3 percent,
depressed by volatile demand for aircraft.  Initial claims  for unemployment insurance last week fell to
420,000 from 423,000 the prior week.  A report from Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan showed
the final December index of  consumer sentiment  rose to 74.5 from
71.6 in November. The figures followed a preliminary reading of
74.2 issued earlier this month. The index averaged 89 in the five
years leading up to the recession that began December 2007.  Treasuries Drop  Stocks were little changed after the reports. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 to 1,256.89 at 10:20 a.m. in New York.
Treasury securities fell, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-
year note up to 3.39 percent from 3.35 percent late yesterday.  Economists estimates for new-home sales ranged from 285,000
to 320,000.  The median price decreased 2.7 percent from November 2009 to
$213,000.  Purchases rose in two of four regions, led by a 37 percent
jump in the West. The Northeast showed the biggest drop at 27
percent.  The supply of homes at the current sales rate fell to 8.2
months’ worth from 8.8 months in October. There were 197,000 new
houses  on the market  at the end of November, the fewest since
March 1968.  Reports earlier this month showed the housing market is
stuck near recession levels.  Housing permits  fell in November,
while starts rose for the first time in three months, the
Commerce Department reported last week.  Existing Houses  Existing home sales , which make up more than 90 percent of
the market, last month rose less than forecast to a 4.68 million
level, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.
That’s higher than the July historic low of 3.84 million as the
tax credit effect was waning and compares with the 2009 low of
4.53 million in January before the tax credit came into effect.  Home resales are tabulated when a contract is closed, while
new-home sales are counted at the time an agreement is signed,
making them a leading indicator of demand.  Economists are debating the likely effect on new-home sales
from the foreclosure moratoriums and regulators’ probes into
faulty paperwork. Most agree the moratoriums pose a risk to
housing sales as a whole.  Atlanta-based  Beazer Homes  USA Inc, which builds and sells
single-family starter homes in the southern part of the country,
remains cautious in its outlook for 2011.  “Sustained high unemployment levels and the overhang of
foreclosures make it very difficult to predict when, and to what
extent, the housing market will recover,” Beazer’s Chief
Executive Officer  Ian McCarthy  said on a conference call last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
