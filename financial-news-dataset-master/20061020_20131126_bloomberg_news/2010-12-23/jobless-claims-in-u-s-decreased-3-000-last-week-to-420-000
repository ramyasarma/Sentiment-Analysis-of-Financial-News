Fewer Americans filed  applications 
for jobless claims last week and the number of people on benefit
rolls dropped to a two-year low, reinforcing evidence the labor
market is improving.  Initial filings for unemployment insurance declined by
3,000 to 420,000 in the week ended Dec. 18, matching the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey, Labor Department figures
showed today in Washington. Those already collecting benefits
fell in the previous week to 4.06 million.  Fewer firings may be an initial step toward the increased
hiring that’s needed to spur consumer spending, which accounts
for 70 percent of the economy. At the same time, Federal Reserve
officials said economic growth is short of the pace needed to
reduce an unemployment rate near 10 percent.  “We have a labor market that is gradually on the mend,”
 Nariman Behravesh , chief economist at IHS Inc. in Lexington,
Massachusetts, said before the report. “It’s still going to be
a long haul.”  Estimates of initial claims in the Bloomberg survey of 45
economists ranged from 400,000 to 430,000. The Labor Department
revised the prior week’s figure up to 423,000.  Today’s report corresponds to the week the Labor Department
surveys businesses to calculate the monthly payroll figures. The
next jobs report is due Jan. 7.  The  four-week  moving average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly claims figures, rose to 426,000 last week from
423,500, today’s data showed.  The number of people  continuing  to receive jobless benefits
declined by 103,000 in the week ended Dec. 11. They were
forecast to fall to 4.1 million.  Extended Benefits  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
152,000 to 4.68 million in the week ended Dec. 4.  President Barack Obama on Dec. 17 signed into law an $858
billion bill extending for two years Bush-era tax cuts for all
income levels. It also continues expanded jobless insurance
benefits to the long-term unemployed for 13 months and reduces
payroll taxes for workers by two percentage points during 2011.  The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 3.2 percent in
the week ended Dec. 11, the lowest since Nov. 22, 2008, from 3.3
percent in the prior week, today’s report showed.  States and Territories  Forty-three states and territories reported a decline in
claims, while 10 reported an increase. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates. That relationship has broken down in
recent months as some companies continue to cut staff while
others expand, indicating an uneven rebound.  “The economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate
that has been insufficient to bring down unemployment,” Fed
officials said in a statement after their policy meeting on Dec.
14.  Businesses that are adding workers include  Motorola Inc. ,
the Schaumburg, Illinois-based maker of mobile phones.  “We have been” hiring, co-Chief Executive Officer  Greg Brown  said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Dec. 15. Even
so, “we need to create jobs faster.”  While the pace of firings has cooled in the last couple of
months, some companies are still paring staff.  Sunnyvale, California-based  Yahoo! Inc.  owner of the
largest U.S. Web portal, last week said it is cutting about 600
jobs, or 4 percent of its workforce, amid a turnaround effort.  To contact the reporter on this story:
